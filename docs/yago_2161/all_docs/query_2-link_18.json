        "text": "Frederik III (March 18, 1609 – February 9, 1670) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670.\n\nKing Frederik III was the second-eldest son of King Christian IV of Denmark and Princess Anne Catherine of Brandenburg the daughter of Margrave Joachim Friedrich of Brandenburg and his first wife Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin.\n\nKing Christian IV met her on his journey in Germany in 1595 and decided to marry her. In 1596, Princess Anne Catherine and her parents were present at his coronation, and the next year, the marriage was arranged.\n\nAs Prince Frederik, he married Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her parents were Duke Georg of Brunswick-Calenberg, and Princess Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt. Nothing is known of her childhood.\n\nPrincess Sophie Amalie married Prince Frederik in Castle Glücksburg on October 1, 1643. The marriage had been arranged in 1640, as it was considered suitable for the current situation of the groom: he was, at that point, Prince-Bishop of Bremen and not heir to the throne, and was not expected to succeed to the throne.\n\nIt is believed to be a political match, though the exact purpose of it is unknown. They had eight children, including King Christian V of Denmark and Princess Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark who married King Carl XI of Sweden.\n\nProclaimed king\n\nThe death of his elder brother Prince Christian in June 1647 opened the possibility for Prince Frederik to be elected heir apparent to the Danish throne. However, this issue was still unsettled when King Christian IV died on February 28, 1648.\n\nAt this juncture the Danish Monarchy was still elective and there was no guarantee Prince Frederik would be elected king. After long deliberation among the Danish Estates and in Rigsraadet (royal council), he was finally accepted as his father’s successor.\n\nOn July 6, the new King Frederik III of Denmark and Norway (where the crown was hereditary) received the homage of his subjects, and he was crowned on November 23rd.\n\nHowever, due to misgivings about the rule of King Christian IV, as well as Frederik’s previous confrontational administrations in Bremen and Verden and his quarrels with Anders Bille, he was only elected after he had signed a Haandfæstning Charter. The Haandfæstning Charter included provisions curtailing the already diminished royal prerogative in favour of increased influence for the Rigsraadet.\n\nKing Frederik III profited by his spirited defense of the common interests of the country and the dynasty. The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period King Frederik III found himself the most popular man in his kingdom.\n\nHe made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute monarchy by the Revolution of 1660. To ensure this conversion he instituted the 1660 state of emergency in Denmark.\n\nAt the September 1660 gathering of the Estates, intended to solve the financial problems faced after the wars, King Frederik III played the different Estates against each other. He succeeded in gaining support for the hereditary monarchy, the annulment of the Haandfæstning Charter, and the institution of absolute monarchical rule by decree.\n\nDuring the last ten years of his reign, the king again took a relative obscure position while the new monarchy was built up and the country tried to recover after the wars.\n\nIn 1665, the Kongeloven (Lex Regia) was introduced: the “Constitution” of Danish absolute monarchy, and the first assertion of divine right underpinned by a written constitution in Europe.\n\nIt decreed that the Monarch “shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone.” This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.\n\nOn February 9, 1670 King Frederik III died at Copenhagen Castle and is interred in Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest son, King Christian V of Denmark.\n\nFrederik IV (October 11, 1671 – October 12, 1730) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1699 until his death. Frederik was the son of Christian V of Denmark-Norway and his wife Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Cassel. Her parents were Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg.\n\nThe newborn Prince was baptized the same evening with the name Frederik by the royal confessional Hans Leth. His grandfather King Frederik III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the reigning King Christian V of Denmark and Norway he was thus Crown Prince from birth. At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.\n\nThe reason Prince Frederik was Crown Prince from birth was due to the actions of his grandfather. Prior to the reign of his grandfather, King Frederik III, Denmark had been an elective monarchy. In 1660 King Frederik III made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute and hereditary monarchy during the Revolution of 1660.\n\nAs Crown Prince, Frederik broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father, Christian V, for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-story building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.\n\nHis father, King Christian V of Denmark and Norway, died on August 25, 1699 from the after-effects of a hunting accident and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral. His son and heir automatically became King Frederik IV of Denmark and Norway.\n\nFrederik IV, having twice visited Italy, had two pleasure palaces built in the Italian baroque style: Frederiksberg Palace that was extended during his reign, when it was converted into a three-storey H-shaped building, and was completed in 1709 by Johan Conrad Ernst, giving the palace a true Italian Baroque appearance and Fredensborg Palace, both considered monuments to the conclusion of the Great Northern War.\n\nHe maintained weekly audiences where anyone could attend and deliver letters with complaints or projects.\n\nVenetian journey\n\nKing Frederik IV holds a memorable place in the social history of the city of Venice for a visit he made during the winter of 1708–09. The king stayed in the city with an entourage of at least 70 people, formally incognito as Count of Oldenburg, not to be unknown, but to avoid the cumbersome and more costly etiquette of a royal visit. During his nine week stay, the king was a frequent guest at operas and comedies and a generous buyer of Venetian glass.\n\nOn his return from Venice the King led political negotiations with the King August II of Poland (Elector of Saxony) and King Friedrich I in Prussia (Elector of Brandenburg) about the impending plans of war against Sweden.\n\nFor much of Frederick IV’s reign Denmark-Norway was engaged in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) against Sweden. In spite of the conclusion of the Peace of Travendal in 1700, there was soon a Swedish invasion and threats from Europe’s western naval powers.\n\nIn 1709 Denmark again entered the war encouraged by the Swedish defeat at Poltava. Frederik IV commanded the Danish troops at the Battle of Gadebusch in 1712. Although Denmark-Norway emerged on the victorious side, she failed to reconquer lost possessions in southern Sweden.\n\nThe most important result was the destruction of the pro-Swedish Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which re-established Denmark’s domination in Schleswig-Holstein. Between 1703 and 1711, Frederick send military units in Hungary and supported Austria in the Rákóczi’s War of Independence. The Danish regiments fought against the Kuruc army and French auxiliaries (Battle of Zsibó).\n\nMuch of the king’s life was spent in strife with kinsmen. Two of his first cousins, King Carl XII of Sweden and Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (the three men were the grandsons of Frederik III of Denmark), had waged war upon his father jointly.\n\nInitially defeated by the Swedes and forced to recognize the independence of Holstein-Gottorp, Frederik IV finally drove the next duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Duke Charles Friedrich (who was Frederik IV’s first cousin once removed) out of Schleswig in 1713, and avoided the revenge contemplated by Charles Friedrich’s mother-in-law, Empress Catherine I of Russia.\n\nDomestic rule\n\nFrederick’s most important domestic reform was the abolition in 1702 of the so-called vornedskab, a kind of serfdom which had fallen on the peasants of Zealand in the Late Middle Ages. His efforts were largely in vain because of the introduction in 1733 of adscription (stavnsbånd), a law that forced peasants to remain in their home regions, and by which the peasantry was subjected to both the local nobility and the army.\n\nDuring Frederik IV rule Copenhagen was struck by two disasters: the plague of 1711, and the great fire of October 1728, which destroyed most of the medieval capital. Although the king had been persuaded by astronomer Ole Rømer (1644–1710) to introduce the Gregorian calendar in Denmark-Norway in 1700, the astronomer’s observations and calculations were among the treasures lost to the fire.\n\nFrederik III (March 18, 1609 – February 9, 1670) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670.\n\nFrederik was born at Haderslev in Slesvig, the son of King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway and the Hohenzollern Princess Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, daughter of Joachim Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg and his first wife Princess Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin.\n\nKing Christian IV met his future Queen while on a journey through the Holy Roman Empire in 1595 and decided to marry her. In 1596, Princess Anne Catherine and her parents were present at his coronation, and the next year, the marriage was arranged.\n\nIn Frederik’s youth and early manhood, there was no prospect of his ascending the Danish throne, as his older brother Christian was elected heir apparent in 1608.\n\nDuring his early childhood, he was raised under the supervision of Beate Huitfeldt. Frederik was educated at Sorø Academy and studied in the Netherlands and France. As a young man, he demonstrated an interest in theology, natural sciences, and Scandinavian history.\n\nOn October 1, 1643 Frederik wed his cousin Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the daughter of Georg Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt, a daughter of Ludwig V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Magdalene of Brandenburg, the daughter of Johann Georg, Elector of Brandenburg and his third wife Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst.\n\nPrincess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, father, Georg was the sixth son of Wilhelm, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his wife Princess Dorothea of Denmark a daughter to King Christian III of Denmark and Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n\nKing Christian III of Denmark was the great-great grandfather of King Frederik III of Denmark.\n\nPrince Georg’s youngest brother, Ernst August, Elector of Hanover, was the father of King George I of Great Britain.\n\nFrederik had an energetic, passionate, and ambitious character. He was an enthusiastic collector of books and his collection became the foundation for the Copenhagen Royal Library.\n\nIn his youth, Frederik became the instrument of his father’s political schemes in the Holy Roman Empire. He was granted administration of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635–45), the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1623–29 and again 1634–44), and named coadjutor of the Bishopric of Halberstadt.\n\nThus, from an early age, he had considerable experience as an administrator.\n\nIn 1633, Frederik’s elder brother Prince-Elect Christian of Denmark and Norway was engaged to Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Saxony, the daughter of Elector Johann Georg I of Saxony and Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia.\n\nMagdalene Sibylle of Prussia was a daughter of Albrecht Friedrich, Duke of Prussia and Princess Marie Eleonore of Cleves. Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia was a great-granddaughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. She is also in three ways an ancestor of Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, mother of George III of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe marriage between Prince-Elect Christian and Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Saxony had been discussed as early as 1630. The wedding took place on October 5, 1634 in Copenhagen among great festivities.\n\nThe marriage was childless, and they resided at Nykøbing Castle in Falster. Prince-Elect\n\nChristian gained a reputation as lazy and as a drinker. He was heavily indebted; despite his father’s attempts to pay some of Christian’s debts, he still owed more than 215,000 rigsdaler in 1647.\n\nHe left Nykøbing for Bohemia on May 8, 1647. He reached Dresden on May 28 and continued on until June 1. Not long after leaving he was struck by a fit of illness. He was brought to a castle in Gorbitz near Dresden, where he died on the next day. He was buried on November 8, 1647 in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. In 1655, his remains were moved to the tombs at Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nThe death of his elder brother Christian in June 1647 opened the possibility for Frederik to be elected heir apparent to the Danish throne. However, this issue was still unsettled when Christian IV died on February 28, 1648.\n\nAfter long deliberation among the Danish Estates and in Rigsraadet (royal council), he was finally accepted as his father’s successor. On July 6, King Frederik III received the homage of his subjects, and he was crowned on November 23.\n\nHowever, due to misgivings about the rule of Christian IV, as well as Frederik III’s previous confrontational administrations in Bremen and Verden and his quarrels with Anders Bille, he was only elected after he had signed a Haandfæstning charter. The Haandfæstning included provisions curtailing the already diminished royal prerogative in favour of increased influence for the Rigsraadet.\n\nAs king, he fought two wars against Sweden. He was defeated in the Dano-Swedish War of 1657–1658, but attained great popularity when he weathered the 1659 Assault on Copenhagen and won the Dano-Swedish War of 1658–1660.\n\nKing Frederik III profited by his spirited defense of the common interests of the country and the dynasty. The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period Frederik found himself the most popular man in his kingdom.\n\nDenmark was an elective monarchy, where elective power was held by the Council of the Realm. However, the King would usually choose an heir and have him hailed as such, thus limiting the Council’s freedom of choice.\n\nKing Frederik III made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute monarchy by the Revolution of 1660. To ensure this conversion he instituted the 1660 state of emergency in Denmark.\n\nAt the September 1660 gathering of the Estates, intended to solve the financial problems faced after the wars, Frederik III played the different Estates against each other. He succeeded in gaining support for the hereditary monarchy, the annulment of the Haandfæstning, and the institution of absolute monarchical rule by decree.\n\nDuring the last ten years of his reign, the king again took a relative obscure position while the new monarchy was built up and the country tried to recover after the wars.\n\nNew men came into government, which was marked by a rivalry between the ministers and councillors like Hannibal Sehested and Kristoffer Gabel. Frederik III concentrated on changing the administrative structure from chancellery to resort colleges and replaced the administrative divisions of fiefs with amt counties.\n\nIn 1665, the Kongeloven (Lex Regia) was introduced: the “constitution” of Danish absolute monarchy, and the first assertion of divine right underpinned by a written constitution in Europe.\n\nIt decreed that the Monarch “shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone.” This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.\n\nKing Frederik III died at Copenhagen Castle and is interred in Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest son, who succeeded by hereditary succession, as King Christian V of Denmark of Norway.\n\nAnother son, Prince George of Denmark and Norway, married Queen Anne of Great Britain. They were second cousins once removed, they were both descended from King Frederik II of Denmark. In 1689 King William III of England created Prince George, Duke of Cumberland."
