Hedwig is Schleswig-Holstein. This family is very close to the Windsors and married Kaiser Wilhelm. There is rumor the Soviet Union looted all that belonged to this family and there is a search underway to restore lands seized by the East Germans to their rightful owners.\n\nMy father, Victor William Presco, was an only child.

The family is named after Glücksburg in northernmost Germany, and is a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg that is descended from King Christian III of Denmark. However, as the elder line of the House of Oldenburg became extinct in the 19th century, the House of Glücksburg is now the senior surviving branch of the House of Oldenburg.\n\nThis particular line comes from the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck. The last of them became Duke of Glücksburg and changed his title accordingly to Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. He was married to Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel, a granddaughter of King Frederick V of Denmark.\n\nNeither the Dukes of Beck nor of Glücksburg were sovereign rulers – they held their lands in fief to the sovereign dukes of Schleswig and Holstein (who were also the Kings of Denmark in personal union) and, before 1773, the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nThe heirs to the Commonwealth realms are descended from Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a paternal grandson of George I of Greece.

The great-granddaughter of King Christian III of Denmark, she was the daughter of Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Sophia Hedwig of Saxe-Lauenburg. She was the sister of Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg\n\nIn 1653 she married Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, brother-in-law to king Frederick III of Denmark. The marriage was childless. In 1665 her first spouse died and she moved to the Herzberg Castle. On 14 June 1668 she remarried to the Great Elector. In 1670, she purchased Brandenburg-Schwedt and other fiefs for her sons. In 1676, she became the commander of her own regiment, Regimentes zu Fuß (1806: No. 7). In 1678 and 1692 she equipped two fleets for the Brandenburg state.\n\nShe died at Karlsbad, and is buried in Berlin Cathedral.

He was of the House of Hohenzollern and is popularly known as the Great Elector (Der Große Kurfürst) because of his military and political skill. Frederick William was also a staunch pillar of the Calvinist faith, associated with the rising commercial class. He saw the importance of trade and promoted it vigorously. The Great Elector’s shrewd domestic reforms gave Prussia a strong position in the post-Westphalia political order of north-central Europe, setting Prussia up for elevation from duchy to kingdom, achieved under his successor.\n\nThere is a thread on Crownprincess Cecilie in “The Hohenzollerns”.I’d like to begin a new thread on other Kaiser Wilhelm ‘s daughteers-in-law.How did they look like? What characters they had? Was their married life happy? How were they getting on with formidable Kaiser?\n\nWith a short legenda each of Princesses,except Cecilie discussed earlier.\n\n1.Princess Eithel Friedrich,nee Duchess Sophie Charlotte of Oldenburg (1879-1964),eldest daughter of Duke Friedich August and Princess Elisabeth of Prussia. “Lotta” married Eithel Friedrich in 1906 and was divorced in 1926.The married couple had no children (they said EF was a homosexual).It seems Sophie Charlotte wanted to marry and leave her parental home becouse of endless conflicts with her step-mother.May be Prince EF was not the best refuge for Lotta.\n\n.Princess August Wilhelm,nee Prss Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Gluksburg (1887-1957), 2d daughter of Duke Friedrich Ferdinand and Prss Caroline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Augustenburg. So Alexandra Victoria was a 1t-cousin of her spouse as her mother was a sister of Empress Augusta Viktoria. Alexandra and Auwi married in 1908,divorced in 1920,they had only one son.She married again.\n\nFor me she was the prettiest d-in-law of Kaiser (after Cecilie,of course).\n\n4. Princess Oskar (at first Grafin von Ruppin),nee Countess Ina von Bassewitz (1888-1973).She was the only “non-royal” d-in-law of Kaiser and they said that Wilhelm liked her most of all his d-in-laws. Ina and Oskar married in 1914 and had a very happy family life .The yhad 4 children.\n\nThe Dorotheenstädti church\n\nIn the year 1687 the Dorotheenstädti church was inaugurated as the tenth place of worship in Berlin and as the first Protestant building of churches. Nearly 200 years in Berlin no more church had been built. By the plague of the yearly 1598 and the Dreißigjährigen war the population had decreased/gone back to at the most 10,000 inhabitants. But in the death year of the large cure prince 1688 18 became already. – to 20,000 inhabitants indicated, and around 1700 were already 29.000. – Frenchmen, Dutchmen, Pfälzer and Welsch Swiss enriched not only the statistics, but likewise the economic, cultural and church development of the city.\n\nIf one regards the perspective plan of the fortress Berlin, which the kurfürstliche made land measurer Johann Bernhard Schulz 1688, then „the new city at that time is “, which in the year 1676 after the second wife of Friedrich Wilhelm Dorothea was designated, particularly well to recognize: From the citizen of Berlin „new Thor ” out goes it westward over the fortress ditch into the long-drawn-out Dorotheenstadt, which is protected by „a horn work “. A vierreihige lime tree avenue, to which the cure princess is to have done the first spade line, particularly falls in the eye, and in the west one sees the new church, which exhibits whole a considerable height compared with its surface. Before the church was delighted, the inhabitants held their service the summer over in the free one „under the lime trees “, in the winter met them in the house „Hamburg messenger ” Paul Grothe.\n\nIn the year 1674 the cure prince had already given his agreement to the building to a small church, at which both lutherische and reformed preachers should exercise their office. 1678 were begun with the Kirchbau, and at the 3rd Advent 1687 – thus nearly after one decade! – one inaugurated the church in presence of the cure prince Friedrich. That happened with two services on the same day: In the morning the reformed Hofprediger Stosch preached, in the afternoon the lutherische preacher Ranslebens. The argument between the two protestant denominations, which were in certain respects at that time further from each other, moved as today the large churches in Germany the whole people. The sympathy of the cure prince was on sides of the reformed ones, and for reasons of the reasons of state tried it, the conflicts, which expenditure-fenced from the Lutheranern for conscience reasons became to hold down by force. In the year 1683 it had forbidden even a Katechismus, which contained hard attacks against the calvinistische teachings. Also the fact that the church did not receive a Biblical name, was designated but simply after the new suburb, is out of consideration opposite the reformed ones to be explained.\n\nBy the edict of potsdam the cure prince 1685 had offered made of France the refugee Protestant in Prussia a new homeland. While in the year 1680 the municipality from 600 Lutheranern and only 37 reformed existed, now the number of the calvinistischen Christians increases. In addition the cure prince gets dutchmen as a building master and craftsmen into his residence. Far more largely however is the number of the French Réfugiés: In the Dorotheenstadt live in the year 1697 already 1615 Frenchmen, that is almost half of all inhabitants. In the year 1698 the national gentleman of the French municipality permits the sharing of the church. Against reimbursement of half of all past expenditures and with the obligation to take part in the future in the preservation of the church you are transferred half of the property at the place of worship. In the course 18. Century should decrease however the number of the Frenchmen in the Dorotheenstadt and the need the use of the church become smaller, since 1705 the French church was built on the gendarme market and 1733 a special chapel in the French hospital, Friedrichstraße 129, near the Oranienburger gate. After some arguments with that in the meantime protestant unierten German municipality in the Dorotheenstadt finally gave up the French municipality in the year 1858 their joint possession right at the church.\n\nOne receives a good impression of the first church building by the multicolored illustration on a porcelain cup, which was given to the preacher father (1831-1880) by two Konfirmandinnen and today in the Märki museum is located. The building „forms in the sketch a Greek cross with three right-angled arms, polygon for closed altar area and four low cultivations in the angles of the cross arms, thus a simple central plant “. Since the cathedral church received a new pulpit in the year 1690, the old cathedral pulpit of the church was left to Dorotheenstäd tables. Probably in the year architect, painters and mathematicians the Rütger of long field the church, built the 1695 deceased of which a sandstone intending board in the southern Kreuzflügel reminded.\n\nThe bells had called already before completion of the building of churches „under the lime trees ” to the service. The largest was provided with the coat of arms of the cure prince and its wife Sophie Dorothea from the house Holstein luck castle. In the year 1680 it had rung „to the thanks because of the pommerschen Viktoria “, i.e. conquest Stettins. She came to completion of the building into the tower, the two different into an opening of the roof. The middle bell from the year 1723 carried the inscription:\n\nSince Friedrich Wilhelm sat on of Prussia king throne a right Salomon of the large Friedrichs son ward my CASTING made to play there and sound if our Zion wants the highest victim to bring.\n\nJohann Porst, which went then as Propst to pc. Nikolai, published a Gesangbuch, which should find as certification of pietistischer Frömmigkeit far spreading and even to 1905 was again printed during its time at Dorotheen in the year 1708 (first anonymous): „Clergyman and lovely songs, which the spirit of the faith by Dr. Martin Luthern, Johann army man, Paul Gerhard and other one its tools in the previous and current times sealed. “- From 1709 to 1719 the after times Propst of pc. Petri, Johann Gustav Reinbeck, „Beichtvater of the queens” and a taught theologian, was preacher at the new church.\n\nLike many churches in Berlin changed also the Dorotheenstädti in the course 19. Century their face. While French occupation at the beginning of the century had stranger troops – by the way Bavaria – in the church lived, which mutilates monuments, organ pipes taken out, coffins in the Grabgewölbe broken open and the old cathedral pulpit burned. Already since the year 1750 the church ground had served as installing chamber for of Prussia soldiers. All of this did not contribute straight to the preservation of the church. Thus one decided 1861 „to a complete renewal of the church in modern brick forms, with retention of the old sketch, on which on 21 November 1863 the new inauguration took place “. The preachers of the Jerusalemskirche said in their greeting to the colleagues: „We feel also in as much connected you in the spirit as your church, as the unsrige, was similar a monument of the union convicition of our prince house and our protestant population still before the introduction of the union. “\n\nOn 18 February 1831 into the Dorotheenstadt as on the Friedrichswerder – both churches were united at the time still in a Pfarrsystem with one another – the 1817 of the king had been carried out proclaimed union. The statute signed by ministers and church executive committees begins with the words: „Stops from now on at the municipalities of the two in all remaining, as before, united Parochien Confessions under separated complete, and forms instead of two for each church only one protestant uniierte municipality. “It is still mentioned that this is valid for all members of the municipality, if the reformed ones not already held themselves among them „the year ago 1817 with express explanation to another reformed municipality”.\n\nIt is remarkable that in the year 1846 by the Ministry for the religious affairs the employment of a Universitätspredigers was ordered, which should hold for Dorotheenstäd tables in the church services for the students. At the 3rd Advent 1847 this – for Berlin probably first „übergemeindliche ” Pfarrstelle, apart from the Militärseelsorge – was opened by a service, with which also the catholic rector at that time of the university held a speech. The Studentenpfarramt was maintained however only up to the year 1856. It was then transferred to the emperor Friedrich Gedächtniskirche.\n\nIn the year 1902/03 the church was again transformed. In place of the past timber ceiling it received a Tonnengewölbe. The emperor and its wife gave marble reliefs of the large cure prince and the cure princess Dorothea, which today in the garden „of the Schleiermacherhäuser ” (Johannes Dieckmann, early pigeon road 3) to see are. On the right of and to the left of the Altarapsis now two chapels were set. One found as communion chapel use, which took up others the monument of the count of the Mark, which had in the dark confessed one hundred years.

In the year 1912 the municipality – together with Friedrichswerder – received the Dorotheenstädti Kirchhof existing this very day, which should become the historically most important cemetery of Berlin.
