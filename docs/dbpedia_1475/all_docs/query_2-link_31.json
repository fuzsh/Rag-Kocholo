Here's the rough model.\n\nThink of features in three categories.\n\nBasic Needs: Basic Needs are features that people take for granted. No one notices them when they work as they should. But if they arenâ€™t in place, your customer can get upset. e.g. a clean room in a hotel.\n\nPerformance Needs: Performance Needs are those needs that are top of mind and essential for users. The more of these that you implement, the more satisfied the user will be. e.g. a comfortable mattress in a hotel.\n\nDelighters: Delighters are features that cause excitement when fully implemented, but are unnoticeable if they are not included at all. e.g. free food upon check-in to a hotel.\n\nIt's easiest to think of the categorization using the Wikipedia graph.\n\nIf you want to satisfy your customer, meeting the basic needs might be enough but, if you want to delight your customer (and don't we all?), you must think about introducing delighters. The hard work, of course, is in identifying what those delighters are and how to accomplish them such that they serve both your customers and your business."
