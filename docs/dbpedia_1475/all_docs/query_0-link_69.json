        "text": "History\n\nSee also: Kingdom of Kano and Timeline of Kano\n\nIn the 7th century, Dala Hill, a residual hill in Kano, was the site of a hunting and gathering community that engaged in iron work (Nok culture); it is unknown whether these were Hausa people or speakers of NigerâCongo languages.[3] Kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill, and was referred to as such as late as the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th by Bornoan sources.[4]\n\nThe Kano Chronicle identifies Barbushe, a warrior priest of Dala Hill female spirit deity known as Tsumbura, Barbushe is from the lineage of the hunter family (maparauta) who were the city's first settlers. (Elizabeth Isichei notes that the description of Barbushe is similar to those of Sao people.[5]) While small chiefdoms were previously present in the area, according to the Kano Chronicle, Bagauda son of Bawo and grandson of the mythical hero Bayajidda,[6] became the first king of Kano in 999, reigning until 1063.[7][8][9] His grandson Gijimasu (1095â1134), the third king, began building city walls (badala/ganuwa) at the foot of Dala Hill. His own son, Tsaraki (1136â1194), the fifth king, completed them during his reign.[9]\n\nIn the 12th century Ali Yaji as King of Kano renounced his allegiance to the cult of Tsumburbura, converted to Islam and proclaimed the Sultanate that was to last until its fall in the 19th century. The reign of Yaji ensued an era of expansionism that saw Kano becoming the capital of a pseudo Habe Empire.\n\nIn 1463 Muhammad Rumfa (reigned 1463â1499) ascended the throne. During his reign, political pressure from the rising Songhai Empire forced him to take Auwa, the daughter of Askiyah the Great as his wife. She was to later become the first female Madaki of Kano. Rumfa reformed the city, expanded the Sahelian Gidan Rumfa (Emir's Palace), and played a role in the further Islamization of the city,[10] as he urged prominent residents to convert.[11] The Kano Chronicle attributes a total of twelve \"innovations\" to Rumfa.[12]\n\nAccording to the Kano Chronicle, the thirty-seventh Sarkin Kano (King of Kano) was Mohammed Sharef (1703â1731). His successor, Kumbari dan Sharefa (1731â1743), engaged in major battles with Sokoto as a longterm rivalry.\n\nFulani conquest and rule\n\nSee also: Kano Emirate\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Fulani Islamic leader Usman dan Fodio led a jihad affecting much of central Sudan which demolished the Habe kingdom, leading to the emergence of the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1805 the last sultan of Kano was defeated by the Jobe Clan of the Fulani, and Kano became an Emirate of the Caliphate. Kano was already the largest and most prosperous province of the empire.[13] This was one of the last major slave societies, with high percentages of enslaved population long after the Atlantic slave trade had been cut off. Heinrich Barth called Kano the greatest emporium of central Africa; he was a German scholar who spent several years in northern Nigeria in the 1850s and estimated the percentage of slaves in Kano to be at least 50%, most of whom lived in slave villages.[13]\n\nThe city suffered famines from 1807 to 1810, in the 1830s, 1847, 1855, 1863, 1873, 1884, and from 1889 until 1890.[14]\n\nFrom 1893 until 1895, two rival claimants for the throne fought a civil war, or Basasa. With the help of royal slaves, Yusufu was victorious over his brother Tukur and claimed the title of emir.[15]\n\nBritish colonization and rule\n\nIn March 1903 after a scant resistance, the Fort of Kano was captured by the British, It quickly replaced Lokoja as the administrative centre of Northern Nigeria. It was replaced as the centre of government by Zungeru and later Kaduna and only regained administrative significance with the creation of Kano State following Nigerian independence.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1914, as the peanut business was expanding, Kano suffered a major drought, which caused a famine.[16] Other famines during British rule occurred in 1908, 1920, 1927, 1943, 1951, 1956, and 1958.[14]\n\nBy 1922, groundnut trader Alhassan Dantata had become the richest businessman in the Kano Emirate, surpassing fellow merchants Umaru Sharubutu Koki and Maikano Agogo.[17]\n\nIn May 1953, an inter-ethnic riot arose due to southern newspapers misreporting on the nature of a disagreement between northern and southern politicians in the House of Representatives.[18] Thousands of Nigerians of southern origin died as a result a political sparked riot.[19]\n\nPost-independence history\n\nAdo Bayero became emir of Kano in 1963. Kano state was created in 1967 from the then Northern Nigeria by the Federal military government. The first military police commissioner, Audu Bako, is credited with building a solid foundation for the progress of a modern society. Most of the social amenities in the state are credited to him. The first civilian governor was Abubakar Rimi.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a ground tracking station was established on the hill called Goron Dutse overlooking Kano to track NASA's Mercury and Gemini spacecraft when they passed over Africa.\n\nIn December 1980, radical preacher Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine led a riot. He was killed by security forces, but his followers later started uprisings in other northern cities.[20]\n\nAfter the introduction of sharia law in Kano State in the early 2000s, many Christians left the city.[21] 100 people were killed in riots over the sharia issue during October 2001.[22][23]\n\nIn November 2007, political violence broke out in the city after the People's Democratic Party (PDP) accused the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) of rigging the November 17 local government elections.[24] (The ANPP won in 36 of the state's 44 local Government Areas.)[25] Hundreds of youths took to the streets, over 300 of whom were arrested; at least 25 people were killed. Buildings set on fire include a sharia police station, an Islamic centre, and a council secretariat. 280 federal soldiers were deployed around the city.[26]\n\nIn January 2012, a series of bomb attacks killed up to 162 people. Four police stations, the State Security Service headquarters, passport offices and immigration centres were attacked. Jihadist insurgents Boko Haram claimed responsibility.[27] After the bombings, Kano was placed under curfew.[28] The Boko Haram insurgency continued with mass murders in March 2013, November 2014 and February 2015.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economic significance of Kano dates back to the pre-colonial Africa when Kano city served as the southernmost point of the famous trans-Sahara trade routes. Kano was well connected with many cities in North Africa and some cities in southern Europe.[36] Formerly walled, most of the gates to the Old City survive. The Old City houses the vast Kurmi Market, known for its crafts, while old dye pitsâstill in useâlie nearby. In the Old City are the Emir's Palace, the Great Mosque, and the Gidan Makama Museum.\n\nThe products exported from Kano to North Africa include textile materials, leather and grains. Kano was connected with trans-Atlantic trade in 1911 when a railway line reached Kano. Kano is a major centre for the production and export of agricultural products like hides, skins, peanuts, and cotton. Kano houses a railway station with trains to Lagos routed through Kaduna, while Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport lies nearby. Because Kano is north of the rail junction at Kaduna, it has equal access to the seaports at Lagos and Port Harcourt. The city maintains its economy and business even in the 21st century with it producing the richest black manâAliko Dangoteâwhose great grand father Alhassan Dantata was the richest during Nigeria's colonial period.\n\nAdo Bayero became emir of Kano in 1963. Kano state was created in 1967 from the then Northern Nigeria by the Federal military government. The first military police commissioner, Audu Bako, is credited with building a solid foundation for the progress of a modern society.I was there at the time, and found him very progressive. He started a lot of development projectsânetwork of roads, a reliable urban water supply. He was a keen farmer himself and funded construction of number of dams to provide irrigation. Thanks to his policies Kano produced all types produce and export it to the neighbouring states.\n\nInconsistent government policies and sporadic electricity supply have hampered industry, so that Kano's economy relies on trade, retail and services. The emergence of large retail outlets starting from early 2000 with Sahad Stores and Jifatu departmental stores revived investor confidence in the sector which led to the construction of the Ado Bayero mall in, then the largest shopping mall in Nigeria with a retail space of 24,000 square metres (260,000 square feet)[37] It has the popular filmhouse cinemas, the South African retail giants Shoprite and Game stores as anchor partners.\n\nKano has six districts: the Old City, Bompai, Fagge, Sabon Gari, Syrian Quarter, and Nassarawa.[38]\n\nAs of November 2007, there were plans to establish an information technology park in the city.[39]\n\nThe city is supplied with water by the nearby Challawa Gorge Dam, which is being considered as a source of hydro power.[40]\n\nThe airline Kabo Air has its head office in the city.[41] Kano is also headquarters of Azman Airlines, Max Air and various travel agency businesses."
