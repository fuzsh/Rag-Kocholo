        "text": "It is a bit disappointing that not many UX and product people know and use Kano survey approach to the feature selection.\n\nThe Kano model is a method to sort proposed features depending on user survey into one of the following bins:\n\n- Must-be features that the customers expect and are taken for granted.\n\n- Linear features which result in satisfaction when fulfilled and dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.\n\n- Delightful features which don’t cause dissatisfaction when not fulfilled.\n\n- Indifferent features the user doesn’t care about.\n\n- Anti-features of reverse quality.\n\nYou can read more in Wikipedia or a recent Brian O’Neill article\n\nThe Kano survey consists of the exclusive pair of questions for each feature:\n\n- How do you feel if the feature in question is PRESENT?\n\n- How do you feel if the feature in question is ABSENT?\n\nand five variants of answers\n\n- I like it this way\n\n- I expect it this way\n\n- I am neutral\n\n- I can live with it this way\n\n- I dislike it this way\n\nBoth answers are then combined to get either feature attribute in the Kano model or invalid answer (when the respondent give mutually exclusive answers). After collecting results from several participants you can calculate feature satisfaction and dissatisfaction coefficients or if you are using the free online survey tool like http://www.kanosurvey.com/ you will get the list of votes per each feature.\n\nSo what can go wrong with this great method?\n\nEven keeping outside the questions about statistical significance and representativity of the target auditory I see some problems with the method for the abstract feature prioritization.\n\nAs it was very well mentioned in the wiki article with time delightful features become perceived as granted and some as indifferent or even anti-features. So depending on the rate of change one needs to look slightly ahead.\n\nAnd if I extrapolate this tendency to the very new not yet existing feature participants mostly start requiring “faster horse”.\n\n“It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nAnother issue I see with the ability of participants to assess the real outcomes of the proposed features. As all the answers will be made by the “fast thinking” brain they are all prone to the whole specter of the cognitive biases.\n\nThough the Kano method looks sound for simple atomic features it becomes extremely tricky to use in the era of AI."
