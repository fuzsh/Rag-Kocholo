        "text": "Written by: Karen Goldstein\n\nEveryone gets excited when it comes to creating and developing new products. From ideation to project management, everyone on the team has ideas and wants to make things happen.\n\nHowever, as good as the enthusiasm is, what almost inevitably happens is that teams end up with too many features to consider and, subsequently, you have no idea where to start.\n\nYou start questioning which features will be game-changers and which will be disappointing financial drains.\n\nYou may also have doubts about the usability of certain features and whether or not they provide value to your customers. To top it off, the time and cost for getting the feature upgrades wrong could set you and your team back months.\n\nThis is where kano analysis comes in. In this ultimate guide, we look at how you can use kano analysis to enhance your products and services, the process, and give you best practice support.\n\nFree eBook: 2024 global market research trends report\n\nWhat is kano analysis?\n\nThe Kano Analysis model (pronounced “Kah-no”), also known as the “Customer Delight vs. Implementation Investment” approach, is an analysis tool that enables you to understand how customer emotional responses to products or features can be measured and explored.\n\nUsing a Kano model questionnaire (used to conduct customer-focussed research), product features are categorized across two-axis scales: satisfaction and functionality. With this, businesses can prioritize features on a product roadmap based on how likely they are to satisfy customers and the implementation investment.\n\nThis is a much more strategic, customer-oriented approach to product development.\n\nThe origins of Kano analysis: Dr. Noriaki Kano\n\nThe kano analysis model was published by Dr. Noriaki Kano, professor of quality management at the Tokyo University of Science, in 1984.\n\nAt the time, complaint processing and enhancing popular features was the accepted way of improving customer loyalty. Kano wanted to see if there were other ways for brands to maintain and improve customer loyalty levels.\n\nHe believed that customer loyalty depended on emotional response levels to features. He hypothesized that there were five emotional response types to features, and conducted a study with 900 participants to explore his theory. With his results, he created the kano reaction graph (below ), which visualizes the five emotional responses as curves.\n\nWith this reaction graph, he was able to prove that customer satisfaction depends on how sophisticated an available function is, which in turn causes a more emotional response.\n\nWhy would you use kano analysis?\n\nKano analysis is very useful for product teams that want to answer these key questions:\n\nHow can we measure customer satisfaction?\n\nWhat features can we create to increase customer satisfaction?\n\nDo our current features cause high customer satisfaction?\n\nHow can we enhance our features so that customer satisfaction is at the optimal level (‘delight customers’)?\n\nBy focusing on these questions and addressing customer needs, product teams can identify what it takes for their product to enter, remain, and excel in a target market.\n\nWhen would you use kano analysis?\n\nWondering when to use the kano model? Here’s when it would be most effective and useful for your business:\n\nWhen there is a limited time\n\nWhen product teams are working to tight deadlines, the kano model is a great tool to speed up decision-making.\n\nWhen there are limited resources\n\nThe simple method for carrying out Kano analysis uses an email questionnaire, meaning that you don’t need expert resources to do the research.\n\nWhen you want to see what would impress your customers\n\nWhen you’re looking to ‘think outside of the box or ‘think big, you can use kano analysis to see what features customers would like and find useful.\n\nWhen you want to enhance a current product\n\nWhen it’s time to refresh the product or keep it competitive against your market competition, using Kano analysis will assess all your feature options and give you clear choices to pick.\n\nBenefits and advantages of kano analysis\n\nSome key benefits of using the kano model are:\n\nSave time and money\n\nThe kano model prevents wasted time and resources associated with developing features that don’t appeal to target customers.\n\nIdentify priority areas\n\nThe kano model identifies the priority areas for your current product’s features that need immediate attention to rectify under-performance.\n\nGroup your best features\n\nThe kano model prioritizes your feature ideas into a clear development plan based on performance enhancement and customer satisfaction levels.\n\nIncrease customer satisfaction\n\nThe kano model avoids feature development on ideas that won’t enhance customer satisfaction so that you can please your customers quicker.\n\nDisadvantages and weaknesses of kano analysis\n\nOn the other hand, the disadvantages of using this tool should be considered as well:\n\nPredominantly quantitative\n\nResults provided by the questionnaire tend to provide quantitative (numerical) results, which can’t explore the ‘why’ behind the data. Further research to delve deeper into results may therefore be needed.\n\nRequires analysis\n\nResults from the questionnaire still need to be analyzed and require some knowledge to interpret and apply findings.\n\nCan be hard to manage\n\nManual methods of administering surveys can be hard to manage — they take time and are difficult to compare. A good technology solution would do this work for you and integrate it with your systems.\n\nHow does Kano analysis work?\n\nKano confirms that a product’s customer loyalty level is defined by the customer’s emotional responses to its features. But the functionality of the product isn’t the only factor that makes it ‘good’ – emotions matter too.\n\nIn general, products can work well and fulfill the basic need it’s required for (e.g. a customer can use it to complete a task, such as using a car’s key to start its engine), but that may not be enough.\n\nA product that works and fulfills its purpose can still be boring or ‘behind the curve’. For example, a car that has self-driving functionality is more impressive, goes beyond the basic needs, and makes a customer think ‘wow’.\n\nTaking this approach, product teams can quickly increase their customers’ satisfaction level by launching a few great, new features, rather than lots of basic ones. The kano model helps you to prioritize which of these ideas are most valuable, so you can make effective business decisions on which to move forward with.\n\nSatisfaction and functionality in the kano analysis model categories\n\nTo understand how the kano reaction graph works, it’s important to understand satisfaction and functionality. The two below appear within the model as measurement scales to understand the customer’s response to a feature.\n\nKano created a satisfaction scale to run from ‘Delighted’ (indicating high satisfaction or excitement) to ‘Frustrated’ (indicating low or no satisfaction).\n\nIn addition, Kano created a functionality scale (also known as the Investment, Sophistication, or Implementation scale) that runs from ‘None’ to ‘Best’. This represents what level of function the customer thinks a feature provides. Has the feature been implemented to the highest level? Is this feature emotionally well-received by the customer?\n\nBased on responses from the kano questionnaire, features can be plotted on the kano reaction graph based on its satisfaction and function level:\n\nThe Five Categories of Features in kano analysis\n\nNow that we know the scales of measurement for each feature, next is the feature categories.\n\nThere are five categories of features that represent five potential customer reactions to a feature\n\nMust-be features\n\nAssociated with the Threshold Attribute line on the Kano graph\n\nMust-be are basic features that customers expect a product or service to have.\n\nThese are considered basic features that are expected to be part of the product or service by default. E.g. A customer expects that their hotel room will be clean and have a comfortable bed.\n\nIf these features are there, the customer is likely to be neutral about them. Having these features won’t likely add more satisfaction.\n\nThe absence of these qualities will cause dissatisfaction.\n\nPerformance features\n\nAssociated to the Performance Attribute line on the Kano graph\n\nPerformance features are desired features that customers want to have to add to their enjoyment of the product or feature, e.g. A car that has a large gas storage tank is considered to store more gas at one time, meaning it performs better than a car that has a smaller gas storage tank.\n\nIf there are a lot of performance features, then customer satisfaction increases in response. Kano described performance features as ‘one-directional, as they increase the satisfaction and functionality upwards.\n\nAttractive features\n\nAssociated to the Excitement Attribute line on the Kano graph\n\nAttractive features are features that cause excitement or delight customers, which sets your product or service above your competition, e.g. Getting a free second product as part of purchasing the first product is not expected but is a delightfully attractive offer that the customer can’t get from other competitors.\n\nAttractive features give satisfaction when they are there, but they don’t cause dissatisfaction when they aren’t there as they aren’t expected to be part of the product in the first place.\n\nIndifferent features\n\nAssociated to the Indifferent Attribute line on the Kano graph\n\nIndifferent features are features that customers think are neither good nor bad. They can be unimportant features to the customer, e.g. The font-face type used on a product’s logo\n\nIndifferent features don’t create satisfaction or dissatisfaction. They’re features that are hardly noticed and don’t make a difference to the customer.\n\nReverse features\n\nNot associated with any lines on the Kano graph, but has the power to impact satisfaction levels.\n\nReverse features are features that can cause dissatisfaction and can be considered undesired features by some people, e.g. The visual formatting in an instruction manual can cause dissatisfaction with customers that prefer a step-by-step text instruction format.\n\nA product team should include more must-be, performance, and attractive features and try to avoid indifferent and reverse features.\n\nPerceptions change over time\n\nAll features will shift and change over time:\n\nCustomer expectations of a product can change over time as more competitive products may enter the market\n\nProduct industry leader, Daniel Zacarias calls this occurrence “the natural decay of delight.” Delight levels increase as products have more exciting features year on year, like Apple phones.\n\nCustomer needs can change according to the environment they’re in\n\nFor example, with business becoming more remote following the COVID-19 pandemic, hotel rooms increasingly needed to come with free WiFi as a basic feature (when in the past it would be seen as an attractive feature).\n\nAttitudes may change\n\nWhat was seen as an indifferent feature in the past, like the amount of plastic used in sandwich wrapping, becomes more important as interest in recycling grows. The indifferent feature can become a reverse feature, actually putting off customers from buying the product.\n\nTherefore, it’s important to remember to update your feature insights regularly and consider your customer’s environment.\n\nKano analysis tutorial\n\nKano analysis uses a standardized questionnaire to help customers feedback about their responses to features. It offers a way to measure opinions in a quantifiable way.\n\nIn the questionnaire, list each feature separately. You can even aid understanding of that feature by providing context or a demonstration of the feature.\n\nFor each feature, two sets of questions are asked:\n\nHow do you feel if you have this feature?\n\nHow would you feel if there was more of…?\n\n(requesting a response based on a positive, or functional, situation)\n\nHow do you feel if you do not have this feature?\n\nHow would you feel if there was less of…?\n\n(requesting a response based on a negative, or dysfunctional, situation)\n\nThe answers are chosen from this range of responses:\n\nI like it\n\nI expect it\n\nI am neutral\n\nI can tolerate it\n\nI dislike it\n\nEvaluating the responses from the kano model questionnaire\n\nBased on the responses, you can figure out which of the five Kano feature categories closely aligns with each feature investigated. You do this by looking at the combination of answers to see how they score against this marking table:\n\nSite Source: Sapioresearch.com\n\nYou can even add in a third question, which was an additional measure about how important a feature is (suggested by John Hauser of MIT, to help prioritize the order of important results).\n\nAsk how important it is for the product/service to have a specific feature, and provide a Likert scale for responses. For example,\n\nIn general, the results from the kano model questionnaire will provide you with:\n\nA sense of how your features are perceived in terms of usefulness and functionality.\n\nHow urgently these features are needed\n\nHow to apply kano analysis results to your business\n\nThere are several ways you can apply kano analysis to your business to improve customer satisfaction levels:\n\nImprove your products and services\n\nYou could start off using kano analysis with this simple five-step method:\n\nGather feature ideas: Collect existing feature ideas or create ideas for features that you think you would like to implement in your products or services.\n\nConduct a kano model survey assessment for each: Use our tutorial section to get started.\n\nApply the Kano feature categories to each feature in question: Using your customer results and your judgment, take each feature and classify these according to the five categories of must be, performance, attractive, indifferent and reverse.\n\nPosition the features on the kano graph to see what features would work best, and where there are quick wins.\n\nLook at the features by category group and work on how you can improve your product or service (you want to look at how each category can be positively productive to the product or service).\n\nFor example, increase the number of excitement attributes while removing or softening the reverse features so they aren’t as offensive to different customer tastes. It’s good practice to get the basic features implemented and then focus on the ‘must be’ features to encourage competitiveness.\n\nPersona traits emerge from kano results\n\nOnce you have the information about categories for each feature, you could align the likes and dislikes from the questionnaire to your marketing personas.\n\nIf there is overlap with the attitudes towards certain features (e.g. features that encourage recycling) and personas (e.g. a young demographic that is environmentally conscious), then you can update marketing messages to these groups and sell your features as benefits.\n\nThese features will likely be seen as attractive to aligned audiences, leading to you having a better chance of selling more products and services.\n\nBenefit vs cost modeling\n\nAs you’ll have a prioritized list of features at the end of the five-step method, you could follow up your planning with a benefit and cost model for each feature.\n\nThis could help understand which features, if implemented, could create a high return on investment by increasing sales.\n\nKnowing this will help inform your product development cycle, especially if time and money resources are short.\n\nUsing in conjunction with NPS or customer reviews or feedback\n\nNet Promoter Score is a metric used in customer experience programs. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single-question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100, and a higher score is desirable.\n\nBy creating positive features and increasing the customer’s satisfaction level towards a product or service, you can help your marketers to impact the overall NPS.\n\nBest practice advice and tips for Kano analysis\n\nChoose the right features: It’s advisable to test up to 20 features with the kano model. More will make the questionnaire too long.\n\nChoose the right customers: Choose a sample size that is representative of your customer segmentation, your market segmentation, and your target marketing personas. Don’t forget about diversity as well! Approximately 15-20 is a good size to go ahead with, as there will be a lot of data coming back to analyze.\n\nGet the best data: Ensure you get the best responses by making sure your questions are clear. Give the draft questionnaire to another team member for a fresh pair of eyes on it.\n\nConsider follow-on qualitative interviews: Alongside the kano model questionnaire, try to get the ‘why’ and context behind the responses with qualitative interviews.\n\nAnalyze your data: How Qualtrics can help you understand your kano analysis results\n\nThe kano model helps you to identify unspoken needs before prioritization.
