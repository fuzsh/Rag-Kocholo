        "text": "A celebration of northern Nigeria's cultural treasure\n\nThe Kano Durbar is the largest procession of colorful horses in the world. It has evolved with the history, culture and tradition of the people of Kano over a period of time. It marks the Islamic holidays Eid-al-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha.\n\nThe location: the city of Kano\n\nKano is located in northern Nigeria, bordering Jigawa from the north and east, Katsina from the west, Kaduna from the southwest and Bauchi from the southeast. Kano is home to over 3 million people - the Hausa speaking Sunni Muslims, the Kanawa of Hausa and/or Fulani ethnicity and settlers. The city of Kano is known for hosting the most spectacular Durbar Festival each year.\n\nThe history\n\nThe Durbar festival dates back to over 200 years when horses were used in warfare to protect the Emirate. Each noble household was expected to defend the emirate by performing a regiment. Once a year, the regiments would gather for a military parade to demonstrate allegiance to the Emir, by showcasing their horsemanship, readiness for war and loyalty.\n\nSymbols of royal linage\n\nThe procession is strictly men only dressed in magnificent robes and turbans, many with one 'ear' or two sticking out denoting their royal linage.\n\nTurbans\n\nThe turban is a symbol of prestige and royalty. The men at the Durbar festival adorn themselves with different colors of turbans.\n\nHawan Sarki\n\nThe Durbar Festival unfolds over four days of grandeur, horsemanship and equestrian parades. Beginning with Hawan Sallah - the Festival Riding, Hawan Daushe, Hawan Nassarawa, and ends with Hawan Doriya. Hawan Daushe is the most intriguing and impressive part of the Durbar celebration, it also features the 'Jahi' the focus of spectators from around the world.\n\nHawan Daushe\n\nThe Hawan Daushe commences as the Emir and his entourage ride out of Gidan Rumfa - the Emir's Palace, through Kofar Kwaru to Baddan Daki - the palace of the Queen Mother, where he pays homage to his mother.\n\nBaddan Daki\n\nThe Emir arrives Baddan Daki, He disembark from his horse and enters the house that is hosting his mother for special greetings. Visitors from far and near enter to greet the Emir.\n\nThe Jahi\n\nThe Emir and his entourage ride through a series of quarters that are home to historically important families and then return to the palace at the Kofar Kudu gate for the Jahi - the salute by the horsemen.\n\nPaying respect to the Emir\n\nThe Emir take his position on arrival at the front of the gate facing outward.\n\nWaves of riders charge towards him, only to pull aside directly in front of him in a cavalry salute."
