        "text": "Capital city of Kaduna State, Nigeria\n\nPlace in Kaduna State, Nigeria\n\nKaduna is the capital city of Kaduna State, and the former political capital of Northern Nigeria. It is located in north-western Nigeria, on the Kaduna River. It is a trade center and a major transportation hub as the gateway to northern states of Nigeria, with its rail and important road network.[3][4]\n\nThe population of Kaduna was put at 760,084 as of the 2006 Nigerian census.[5] Rapid urbanization since 2005 has created an increasingly large population, and as at 2023, the city has an estimated population of 1.1 million people.[6]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe etymology of the word Kaduna is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word for \"crocodiles\", Kaddanni in the Hausa language (kaduna being the plural form).[7] Another version of the name proposes a link to the Gbagyi word/name 'Odna', meaning 'river'.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKaduna was founded by British colonists in 1900.[9] The first British governor of Northern Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard, chose the present site for development due to its proximity to the Lagos-Kano Railway.[10] It became the capital of Nigeria's former Northern Region in 1917,[11] and retained this status until 1967. The city is still influential as the headquarters of various political, military and cultural organizations especially in Northern Nigeria.[12]\n\nIn 1976, when the General Murtala Mohammed administration created seven new states in Nigeria, North Central State, with capital at Kaduna, was renamed Kaduna State. It was made up of the two colonial period Provinces of Zaria and Katsina. When in 1991, the number of states in the country was increased from twenty-one to thirty. Katsina Province became Katsina State, while the old Zaria Province became the new Kaduna State. There are twenty-three local government areas (LGAs) in the state, although the number of ethnic groups is much larger.[13]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nIndustries\n\n[edit]\n\nKaduna is a major industrial center in Northern Nigeria, manufacturing products like textiles, machinery, steel, aluminum, petroleum products and bearings.[14] However, the textile industry has been in decline due to recent Chinese imports and factory closures caused by years of neglect during the military dictatorship in Nigeria. Other light manufactures include: plastics, pharmaceuticals, leather goods, furniture, and televisions.[10] Agriculture is also a major industry in Kaduna, and as such, the Bank of Agriculture has its headquarters in the city.[15] Some main agricultural exports include: cotton, peanuts, sorghum, and ginger.[16] Kaduna also has a branch of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.[10] Automobile manufacturing also remains an important part of Kaduna's economy.[17] Peugeot Automobiles Nigeria has an assembly plant in Kaduna.[18] Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC), one of Nigeria's four main oil refineries is located in Kaduna. It is supplied by a pipeline from the Niger Delta oil fields.[10][19]\n\nA 2009 World Bank survey states that Kaduna is one of the top six cities with the highest unemployment. 20% of the population was estimated to be unemployed.[17]\n\nSports and tourism\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a large racecourse named Murtala Mohammed Square, approximately 1.6 kilometres (1 mi) in perimeter, inside which is found the Kaduna Polo Club. Kaduna Golf Club is also located within the Kaduna CBD. Other sports facilities include the Ahmadu Bello Stadium and Ranchers Bees Stadium. [20] The city boasts of several tourist attractions some of which are:\n\nKaduna National Museum\n\nJaji Military Cantonment\n\nKajur Castle [21]\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe infrastructure network in the city were upgraded by the administration of Governor Nasir el-Rufai with underpass, flyover structures and streetlight facilities. Kaduna has an inland dry port.[22] The Nigerian military has several installations in the city including the Nigerian Defence Academy.[23]\n\nAirport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is served by Kaduna International Airport. The airport commenced operations in 1982.[24] The Nigerian Air Force maintains a presence in the city.[25][26]\n\nRailways\n\n[edit]\n\nKaduna is also on the route of the planned Lagos–Kano Standard Gauge Railway, which has been completed between the national capital of Abuja and Kaduna. Trains for Abuja depart from the Rigasa Railway Station in Kaduna.[27] Kaduna is an important junction on Nigeria's Cape gauge railway network. At Kaduna, a branch line connects the Lagos–Nguru Railway to the Port Harcourt–Maiduguri railway.[28]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nKaduna is popularly known as the centre of learning, as evident from the numerous educational institutions located in the state. Tertiary Institutions in Kaduna city include:\n\nKaduna State University[29]\n\nNigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna[23]\n\nGreenfield University Kaduna[30]\n\nNational Open University of Nigeria, Kaduna Study Center\n\nAir Force Institute of Technology, Kaduna[31]\n\nNational Teachers Institute (NTI), Kaduna[32]\n\nSchool of Midwifery Kaduna[33]\n\nKaduna Polytechnic (1968), Kaduna[34][35]\n\nNational board for Islamic and Arabic studies[36]\n\nKaduna Business School[37][38]\n\nDialogue Institute Kaduna\n\nInstitute of Ophthalmology, National Eye Centre, Kaduna.[39]\n\nNational board for Arabic and Islamic studies\n\nNational center for nomadic education\n\nAhmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State\n\nAdministrative Areas\n\n[edit]\n\nAdministration of the state started with the concept of Provincial Administration and Native/Local Authority systems. However, in 1976 the Mohammed Administration introduced the Local Government Area system (LGA) which delegated some responsibilities to the elected/appointed councillors. With each successive Federal Military Administration, the number of the LGAs in Kaduna State increased from fourteen in early 1980s to the present twenty three in 1998. In each LGA, smaller units such as districts and wards, are recognised.[13]\n\nPlaces of worship\n\n[edit]\n\nAmong the places of worship, there are churches and mosques.[40] Sultan Bello Mosque is the biggest and a central mosque in Kaduna. There are also churches: Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaduna (Catholic Church), Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Universal Reformed Christian Church (Protestant Church).[41]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRailway stations in Nigeria\n\nKaduna State\n\nNational Ear Care Centre\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
