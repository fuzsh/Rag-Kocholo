        "text": "International airport in Kano, Nigeria\n\n\"DNKN\" redirects here. The term may also refer to Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nMallam Aminu Kano International Airport (IATA: KAN, ICAO: DNKN) is an international airport serving Kano, the capital city of Kano State of Nigeria. It was a Royal Air Force station before the country became independent. It is the main airport serving northern Nigeria and was named after the 20th-century politician Aminu Kano. The airport has an international and a domestic terminal. Construction started on a new domestic terminal and was commissioned on 23 May 2011. In 2009, the airport handled 323,482 passengers. The bulk of international flights cater to the large Sudanese community in Kano and Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMallam Aminu Kano International Airport is the oldest in Nigeria, with operations starting in 1936. In the first decades of operation, it became an important fuel stop for airlines flying long-haul services between Europe and Africa. Newer aircraft did not need such fuel stops and, with the demise of the Kano economy in the late 20th century, many international airlines stopped serving the airport. When they indefinitely suspended services to Kano in June 2012, KLM was the only European airline serving the city, which they had done without interruption since 1947.[4]\n\nFacilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe airport serves civilian and military flights. Runway 06/24 is mainly used for civilian flights, while runway 05/23 primarily serves the Nigerian Air Force base at the south side of the airport. Runway 05/23 was in use for all operations when the main runway was rehabilitated in the beginning of the 21st century. The terminal facilities lie between the two runways.\n\nThe main terminal with the control tower serves international flights and domestic services operated by Arik Air. Facilities in the departure lounge are minimal, with a newsstand near the check-in counter and a small bar at airside. There is a small VIP lounge for business class passengers. Duty-free shops are currently closed. There is a small bar and a post office in the arrivals hall. On the south side of the airport, along runway 06/24, is the domestic terminal currently serving operations of IRS Airlines. Facilities include a newsstand and a small bar. Construction of a new domestic terminal, adjacent to the main terminal building, started in the beginning of the 21st century. Construction was abandoned but was resumed. The operator of the airport, Federal Airports Authority Nigeria (FAAN), saw the completion of the new terminal in November 2009. It was commissioned in May 2011.[1]\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\n[edit]\n\nPassenger\n\n[edit]\n\nAirlinesDestinationsAero Contractors Abuja, Lagos Air Peace Abuja, Asaba,[5] Lagos, Niamey,[6] Owerri, Port Harcourt–Omagwa Arik Air Abuja Azman Air Abuja, Lagos Badr Airlines Khartoum Egyptair Cairo Eritrean Airlines Asmara, Khartoum[7] Ethiopian Airlines Addis Ababa flynas Jeddah Max Air Abuja, Benin City, Lagos\n\nSeasonal charter: Jeddah Qatar Airways Doha[8] Saudia Jeddah, Medina Sudan Airways Khartoum Tarco Aviation Khartoum ValueJet Abuja\n\nCargo\n\n[edit]\n\nAirlinesDestinationsAerotranscargo Munich[9][better source needed] EgyptAir Cairo[citation needed] Ethiopian Airlines Cargo Liège[citation needed] Saudia Cargo Jeddah[citation needed]\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nThese data show number of passengers movements into the airport, according to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria's Aviation Sector Summary Reports.\n\nYear 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2021 Passengers 302,017 349,057 381,862 363,290 341,367 381,841 448,792 369,132 327,267 433,263 389,530 458,157 428,742 291,214 Growth (%) 3.13% 15.58% 9.40% 4.86% 6.03% 11.86% 17.53% 17.75% 11.34% 32.39% 10.09% 17.62% 6.42% 32.1% Source: Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).

Of the 45 passengers and crew on board, only 13 survived.\n\nOn 22 January 1973, the Kano Air Disaster occurred - an Alia Boeing 707-320C crashed at Kano International while attempting a landing in high winds. 176 of the 202 passengers and crew on board were killed. It remains the worst aviation disaster in the history of Nigeria.\n\nOn March 31, 1992 Trans-Air Service Flight 671 was a cargo flight from Luxembourg Airport to Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport in Kano, Nigeria. While flying over France on March 31, 1992, the Boeing 707 operating the flight experienced an in-flight separation of two engines on its right wing. Despite the damage to the aircraft, the pilots were able to perform an emergency landing at Istres-Le Tubé Air Base in Istres, France. All five occupants of the aircraft survived; however, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair due to a fire on the right wing.\n\nOn 4 May 2002, EAS Airlines Flight 4226, a BAC 1-11-500 twin-engine jet crashed upon take-off from Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, killing 73 passengers and crew on board as well as 30 more on the ground into whose houses the plane had crashed.[16]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTransport in Nigeria\n\nList of airports in Nigeria\n\nList of the busiest airports in Africa\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency"
