        "meta_description": "Downloadable! This paper examines the introduction of piped water during the colonial period and how people resisted it. Water is an important basic necessity of life that is very crucial to the socio-economic development of any society. In fact, adequate provision of water serves as basic pre-requisite for industrial development. Before the introduction of piped water in the 20th century in Kano, the people recognized the necessity and importance of water supply in the execution of their daily activities. Traditionally, the people of Kano used various means to provide water for domestic consumption, use in cottage industries and for other purposes. Some of the major sources of water included wells, dams, rainfall/rainwater and rivers. In addition to the private wells inside the houses, there were some popular public wells located in various parts of the parts of the city. The British conquest of Kano in 1903 led to the imposition of colonial rule. The provision of piped water supply in Nigeria first started in Lagos in towards the end of the 19th century. The process of water supply in Kano started in 1924 and commissioned in 1931. At the initial stage, many people refused to drink piped water (ruwan pampo) and even speculated that whoever consumed it would certainly loss his faith. In order for the British colonial administrators to compel people to patronize the water, most of the historic public wells were destroyed. However, despite the lukewarm attitude shown by the people of Kano toward the piped water, it gradually became more acceptable to the extent that a poem was composed in praise of the Europeans for water supply. This paper using extant literature and oral information explores the history of the transformation of water supply in Kano.",
