        "text": "Wikipedia generates over 4 billion page visits a month. That makes it one of the most popular websites in the world.Â\n\nPublishing a Wikipedia page offers a great opportunity to share knowledge, and build credibility and notability on a certain topic. It also has the potential to impact public relations, brand recognition, and search engine optimization (SEO) visibility for companies looking to create a Wikipedia page.Â\n\nIâve spent time gathering resources, reading through Wikipediaâs guidelines, and formulating Wikipedia pages â so you donât have to. In this article, youâll learn the ropes by exploring examples of stellar articles and discovering the essentials for your own success. Understanding key policies, starting small, and maintaining neutrality are your stepping stones for how to write a Wikipedia page so itâll get approved.Â\n\nFrom grasping Wikipedia policies to crafting your initial draft, Iâll guide you through the process all the way to submitting your finished article for review.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUnderstanding Wikipedia's policies, such as the neutral point of view (NPOV), verifiability, and no original research, is essential for contributing to the site.\n\nAnything overly promotional is likely to get deleted. Avoid creating articles on topics that are considered a conflict of interest.\n\nMake sure your chosen topic has good coverage in reliable, independent sources to determine its notability.\n\nBest practices for Wikipedia article success\n\nLetâs take a look at how to get your Wikipedia article approved by understanding policies, starting small, finding the right topic, and keeping a neutral tone. Iâve also provided a handful of examples of well-written articles.\n\nUnderstand Wikipedia's policies\n\nComprehending Wikipedia's core policies, such as the neutral point of view (NPOV), verifiability, and no original research, is essential. NPOV emphasizes presenting information without bias or opinion, while verifiability mandates that all content must be backed by reliable sources.Â\n\nThe policy against original research means content must be derived from existing reputable sources rather than personal interpretations or unpublished material.\n\nStart small\n\nBeginning with smaller edits or contributions to existing articles is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's editing interface and etiquette. By making constructive changes and adhering to guidelines, users can gain experience and build a positive editing history. This is all going to be helpful when you start creating your first article draft (covered in more detail later).\n\nKeep a neutral tone\n\nMaintaining a neutral tone throughout the article is important. Wikipedia articles should avoid bias, promotion, or opinionated language. By presenting information objectively, the article remains credible and inclusive of diverse perspectives.Â\n\nAnything overly promotional is likely to get deleted. This also goes for topics that are considered a conflict of interest. So, if you, as the article author, are too closely related to or directly involved with the article topic, Wikipedia may decide itâs a conflict of interest. For example, if you want to write about a person who is a close family member. Or, if you want to create a Wikipedia article on a business that youâre employed by.Â\n\nLetâs take a look at the same texts â one written in a promotional tone and the other in a neutral tone.\n\nFind a notable topic\n\nThere are over 6.75 million pages on Wikipedia. So picking a topic thatâs not already been covered can be difficult. Plus, your topic needs to meet Wikipediaâs notability guidelines. Letâs take a look at what this means and how to determine if your topic is notable.\n\nNotability refers to the criteria that determine whether a topic warrants its own Wikipedia article. Make sure your chosen topic has good coverage in reliable, independent sources â this establishes its notability.Â\n\nNote: Make sure your topic hasn’t already been covered on Wikipedia! Use the search function to double-check.\n\nLetâs look at a notable topic with an existing Wikipedia article: The Voynich Manuscript.\n\nWhat makes it notable?\n\nThe Voynich Manuscript is an ancient, mysterious text dating back to the 15th century, written in an unknown script and language. Its cryptic nature and unknown origin make it a subject of fascination and scholarly interest.\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes it a good topic to cover in a Wikipedia article?\n\nSignificant coverage\n\nDespite extensive efforts by linguists, cryptographers, and historians, the manuscript's contents and purpose remain undeciphered. The manuscript has garnered attention from various academic disciplines and has been extensively covered in books, articles, and documentaries exploring its enigmatic nature.\n\nComprehensive content\n\nThe Wikipedia page provides a detailed overview of its history, physical characteristics, attempts at decipherment, and the various theories proposed to understand its content and origins. It includes information about its illustrations, scientific analyses, and notable attempts by researchers to decode its script.\n\nâReliable sources\n\nThe information in the article is supported by citations from reputable sources, including scholarly articles, books, and academic research papers. This ensures the accuracy and credibility of the content.\n\nExamples of well-written Wikipedia pages\n\nLetâs take a look at a few examples of well-written articles and why they work:\n\nBarack Obama: Note the comprehensive coverage of different aspects of his life and presidency, supported by numerous citations.\n\nCats (musical): A well-organized page detailing the musical's history, productions, and reception with extensive references.\n\nMarie Curie: This page extensively covers the life, scientific contributions, and legacy of Marie Curie, including her research in radioactivity and her impact on science.\n\nThe Great Gatsby: A comprehensive page about F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, including details about the plot, themes, characters, and its cultural significance, supported by references.\n\nApple Inc.: Offers a comprehensive, well-cited, and neutrally presented history of the company's milestones, products, controversies, and corporate culture, meeting the platform's standards for verifiability and neutrality.\n\nPatagonia, Inc.: Presents a detailed yet neutral account of the company's environmental activism, sustainable business practices, product lines, corporate ethos, and social initiatives, all thoroughly backed by reliable citations and references.\n\nâ\n\nCreate a Wikipedia page in 7 easy steps\n\nNow that you have the tools to make sure your Wikipedia article gets approved, letâs break down how to create the article and submit it for review.\n\nStep 1: Create a Wikipedia account\n\nRegistering a Wikipedia account enables users to contribute to the platform and track their edits. An account also allows for participation in discussions, creating drafts, and monitoring changes made to articles. Having a username establishes accountability and fosters a sense of belonging within the Wikipedia community.\n\nTo create a Wikipedia account:\n\n1. Click \"Create Account\": On the top right corner of the page, you'll see \"Create account.\" Click on it.\n\n2. Choose a username: Enter a username of your choice. Ensure it complies with Wikipedia's username policy, avoiding offensive or misleading names.\n\n3. Enter a password and email: Create a strong password for your account. Enter your email address, which is necessary for password recovery and notifications.\n\n4. Optional Details & Terms Agreement: You may choose to provide optional details, such as your gender, date of birth, and language preferences. This step is not mandatory. Read Wikipedia's terms of use and privacy policy. Check the box to confirm you agree with the terms.\n\n5. Click \"Create Your Account\": Once you've filled in the necessary information, click on the button to create your account.\n\n6. Verify your email (if required): Depending on Wikipedia's current policies, you might need to verify your email address by clicking on a confirmation link sent to the email you provided.\n\nCongratulations! You've successfully created a Wikipedia account. You can now start editing articles, creating drafts, and contributing to the platform.\n\nStep 2: Do your research\n\nThorough research is the backbone of a credible Wikipedia page. Accessing diverse, reputable sources like books, scholarly articles, newspapers, and magazines helps create a robust foundation. Relying on these sources for information and citing them as references in the article reinforces its credibility and validity. Make sure your sources meet Wikipediaâs guidelines.\n\nHere are some tips on how to start researching and collecting source material:\n\nGather reliable sources: Use reputable sources such as books, scholarly articles, newspapers, archives, and credible websites. Look for information from experts or authoritative publications related to your topic.Â\n\nUse diverse sources: Collect information from a variety of perspectives and viewpoints to present a well-rounded view of the topic. Consider both primary and secondary sources to ensure accuracy. Itâs a good idea to explore different authors and experts that might have different opinions. Explore regional material, too: this can give good clues to cultural differences on your topic.Â\n\nTake notes and organize: As you research, take detailed notes and organize them systematically. Note key dates, events, names, and relevant quotes along with their respective sources for citation.\n\nVerify information: Double-check facts, dates, and claims across multiple sources to ensure accuracy. Cross-reference information to avoid relying on potentially biased or inaccurate sources.\n\nUnderstand context and background: Gain a thorough understanding of the historical, cultural, or contextual background related to your topic. This helps in providing comprehensive coverage and context in the article.\n\nUse specialized databases and libraries: Access specialized databases, libraries, or repositories that focus on specific fields or subjects. They might contain unique and diverse resources relevant to your topic.\n\nEngage with varied disciplines and fields: If your topic spans multiple disciplines, explore sources from those diverse fields to gain a comprehensive understanding.\n\nConsult academic and subject experts: Reach out to professors, researchers, or subject experts in the field. They may recommend niche or diverse sources that are not widely known.â\n\nReview citations in existing publications: Check the reference lists of articles, books, or other publications related to your topic. These citations can lead you to additional diverse sources.\n\nAI Tip: Add all of your source material to the Wordtune Summarizer Library. Easily access your documents, articles, journals, videos, and more. Search your library using keywords to quickly find the information you’re looking for.\n\nStep 3: Drafting the page\n\nThe sandbox feature on Wikipedia allows users to create and refine drafts before publishing. It helps you organize information, structure the article, and experiment with formatting and content. Drafting in the sandbox provides a safe space to refine the article before making it publicly visible.\n\nTo access the sandbox, click your avatar in the top right corner. Select âSandboxâ from the drop-down menu. Youâll then see an editor. You can swap between the classic and visual editor modes â depending on what works best for you.\n\nTip #1: Use Wordtune to help you craft your text and beat writer’s block! It can also help you paraphrase information from your research, without plagiarizing. Just make sure you check that your information comes from reliable sources and adheres to Wikipedia's guidelines. AI-generated content should be used cautiously and not as the primary source of information.\n\nTip #2: Find resources, training modules, and guidance on Wiki Education's Training Dashboard.\n\nStep 4: Citing reliable sources\n\nIncorporating citations from reliable sources throughout the article is crucial. Each statement or claim should be backed by a citation to a reputable publication or website. Inline citations within the text link specific statements to their respective sources, enabling readers to verify the information's accuracy.\n\nAI Tip: Citation generator tools like Zotero or EasyBib can assist in properly formatting citations.\n\nCheck out Wikipediaâs complete guide on citing sources for more information.\n\nStep 5: Review and edit\n\nThoroughly reviewing the draft multiple times before submission is essential. Checking for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and adherence to guidelines helps ensure the quality of the article. Continuous editing and peer review can significantly enhance the article's overall quality, too.\n\nWhat to look out for:\n\nProofread your work to make sure your writing is error-free with no grammar or spelling mistakes.\n\nCheck all your citations are formatted correctly and any links still work.\n\nCheck to make sure your writing is neutral and free of any personal opinions or biases. It can be a good idea to get someone to review your work, too.\n\nYour writing should be clear and concise. Use Wordtune to help you shorten sentences and provide rewrite suggestions.Â\n\nStep 6: Submitting for review\n\nOnce the article meets Wikipedia's standards, it can be submitted for review. Keep in mind that this is a peer-review process. That means that editors or experienced community members will provide feedback, request revisions, or make improvements. Being receptive to feedback and making necessary adjustments increases the likelihood of approval.Â\n\nTip: Be patient! It can take a few weeks to a few months before a Wikipedia page is approved.\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a successful Wikipedia page requires diligence, adherence to guidelines, and a commitment to providing accurate, neutral information supported by reliable sources.
