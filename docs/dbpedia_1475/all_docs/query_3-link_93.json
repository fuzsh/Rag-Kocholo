        "text": "Over the past decade, the paradigm of the World Wide Web has shifted from static web pages towards participatory and collaborative content production. The main properties of this user generated content are a low publication threshold and little or no editorial control. While this has improved the variety and timeliness of the available information, it causes an even higher variance in quality than the already heterogeneous quality of traditional web content. Wikipedia is the prime example for a successful, large-scale, collaboratively created resource that reflects the spirit of the open collaborative content creation paradigm. Even though recent studies have confirmed that the overall quality of Wikipedia is high, there is still a wide gap that must be bridged before Wikipedia reaches the state of a reliable, citable source. A key prerequisite to reaching this goal is a quality management strategy that can cope both with the massive scale of Wikipedia and its open and almost anarchic nature. This includes an efficient communication platform for work coordination among the collaborators as well as techniques for monitoring quality problems across the encyclopedia. This dissertation shows how natural language processing approaches can be used to assist information quality management on a massive scale. In the first part of this thesis, we establish the theoretical foundations for our work. We first introduce the relatively new concept of open online collaboration with a particular focus on collaborative writing and proceed with a detailed discussion of Wikipedia and its role as an encyclopedia, a community, an online collaboration platform, and a knowledge resource for language technology applications. We then proceed with the three main contributions of this thesis. Even though there have been previous attempts to adapt existing information quality frameworks to Wikipedia, no quality model has yet incorporated writing quality as a central factor. Since Wikipedia is not only a repository of mere facts but rather consists of full text articles, the writing quality of these articles has to be taken into consideration when judging article quality. As the first main contribution of this thesis, we therefore define a comprehensive article quality model that aims to consolidate both the quality of writing and the quality criteria defined in multiple Wikipedia guidelines and policies into a single model. The model comprises 23 dimensions segmented into the four layers of intrinsic quality, contextual quality, writing quality and organizational quality. As a second main contribution, we present an approach for automatically identifying quality flaws in Wikipedia articles. Even though the general idea of quality detection has been introduced in previous work, we dissect the approach to find that the task is inherently prone to a topic bias which results in unrealistically high cross-validated evaluation results that do not reflect the classifier’s real performance on real world data. We solve this problem with a novel data sampling approach based on the full article revision history that is able to avoid this bias. It furthermore allows us not only to identify flawed articles but also to find reliable counterexamples that do not exhibit the respective quality flaws. For automatically detecting quality flaws in unseen articles, we present FlawFinder, a modular system for supervised text classification. We evaluate the system on a novel corpus of Wikipedia articles with neutrality and style flaws. The results confirm the initial hypothesis that the reliable classifiers tend to exhibit a lower cross-validated performance than the biased ones but the scores more closely resemble their actual performance in the wild. As a third main contribution, we present an approach for automatically segmenting and tagging the user contributions on article Talk pages to improve the work coordination among Wikipedians. These unstructured discussion pages are not easy to navigate and information is likely to get lost over time in the discussion archives. By automatically identifying the quality problems that have been discussed in the past and the solutions that have been proposed, we can help users to make informed decisions in the future. Our contribution in this area is threefold: (i) We describe a novel algorithm for segmenting the unstructured dialog on Wikipedia Talk pages using their revision history. In contrast to related work, which mainly relies on the rudimentary markup, this new algorithm can reliably extract meta data, such as the identity of a user, and is moreover able to handle discontinuous turns. (ii) We introduce a novel scheme for annotating the turns in article discussions with dialog act labels for capturing the coordination efforts of article improvement. The labels reflect the types of criticism discussed in a turn, for example missing information or inappropriate language, as well as any actions proposed for solving the quality problems. (iii) Based on this scheme, we created two automatically segmented and manually annotated discussion corpora extracted from the Simple English Wikipedia (SEWD) and the English Wikipedia (EWD). We evaluate how well text classification approaches can learn to assign the dialog act labels from our scheme to unseen discussion pages and achieve a cross-validated performance of F1 = 0.82 on the SEWD corpus while we obtain an average performance of F1 = 0.78 on the larger and more complex EWD corpus.\n\nWikipedia is a multilingual internet encyclopedia which users can freely use or edit, and whose contents are written collaboratively by volunteers from all over the world. Over the last decade, its innovative mode of production allowed it to accumulate and organize unprecedented volumes of content and establish itself as a prominent resource in contemporary information society. At the same time, however, its reliance on un-vetted and unprofessional voluntary labor raises widespread doubts regarding its reliability and legitimacy as a source of information. This study explores the institutionalization and subsequent reception of Wikipedia as a distinctive, emergent form of epistemic culture – i.e. amalgams of standards and practices underlying the production and legitimation of knowledge (Knorr-Cetina, 1999). As such, it presents a strategic case allowing us to observe how new epistemic cultures are constructed, debated and institutionalized in practice. Current research tends to explain Wikipedia’s success in a-historical terms, using its current features as taken for granted explanatory factors. In contrast, this study draws attention to the contingent and contentious processes through which these features were formed, negotiated and institutionalized during Wikipedia's initial, founding phase using previously unavailable archives from that period. Moreover, while research has tended to neglect the context of Wikipedia's consumption, this study also examines Wikipedia's reception and use by a specific category of knowledge experts —namely, journalists—who use it routinely in the course of their work and have the capacity to propagate its legitimacy. Combining attention to both production and reception, I suggest can lead to a better understanding of Wikipedia's actual success and legitimation processes. Theoretically, this research reconstructs Wikipedia’s history and patterns of production and consumption through pragmatist lenses—emphasizing the importance of exploring concrete practices and objects rather than abstract beliefs or values. Thus, the argument centers on the ways in which actors creatively solve problems they encounter in the course of action, focusing on their use and translation of extant repertoires of practices and justifications. It draws upon insights from several pragmatically oriented theoretical streams, mainly related to Studies of Science and Technology (STS), such as Knorr-Cetina’s constructivism, Susan L. Star's interactionism and Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Opting for such a pragmatist approach allows me to both conceive of Wikipedia as a modern epistemic object, and outline actors’ modes of engagement with the practicalities of knowledge giving which sustain it. Methodologically, the first part of this study is based on a newly available database of almost all the web activity conducted in Wikipedia's formative first year, providing a comprehensive record of every edit entry and dispute in the field. The main analytic tool I use here is the “cartography of controversies” (Venturini, 2009), an Actor-Network Theory inspired approach which maps the locations and actions of different actors within a network, and traces how disputed claims become taken-for-grated and “black-boxed.” The second part, examining Wikipedia's reception, is based on in depth, semi-structured, interviews I have conducted with 20 journalists in Israel. The following, empirical section starts with two chapters linking Wikipedia to its immediate historical origins – the first of them tracing the failure of Nupedia as the first serious open internet encyclopedic project, and the second comparing this failure to the processes which eventually led to Wikipedia subsequent success. In an attempt to give it a solid basis of legitimacy, Nupedia's founders designed a production system based on rigid and restrictive practices of knowledge giving imported from the academic world, and relied on the participation of volunteer certified experts. Its failure to capitalize on the legitimacy of existing cultural practices, expressed in its inability to build a viable gift-economy attractive to the volunteers they sought, led its founders to try and supplement it with its mirror image, i.e. an open, almost unstructured project. The result was Wikipedia: a project aiming for production volume rather than legitimacy, and based on an essentially unrestricted contribution of knowledge. Subsequent chapters then show how Wikipedia's policies and standards were established from this chaotic origin in the midst of a series of conflicts and controversies. As I show through detailed analysis of several such controversies, the negotiation of these conflicts led to the emergence of number of key principles of coordination: the primacy of the traditional encyclopedic model as a \"standard for standards\"; the legitimacy of the Wiki cultural as a resource for schemes and practices; radical collaboration and lack of hierarchy in the writing and editing process; the reliance on effective consensus between editors to establish policy; the dialogical nature of knowledge construction; the reliance on references to other texts rather than on expertise and original research to establish knowledge; and finally, the preference for productivity and content quantity over control and quality. In addition, I demonstrate how various \"conscription devices\" (Henderson, 1991), such as policy pages, warning templates and software features, were erected to sustain these principles as well as to establish new forms of gift practices, many of which still stand at the basis of Wikipedia's current structures and practices. Emerging from this description is a distinct form of knowledge production, contribution and coordination displaying a relatively informal pattern of institutionalization, based on the erection of what I term \"Privileged Passage Points,\" (PPPs) a concept coined to highlight the common features of several elements in Wikipedia – such as its policy pages and the authority of its founders—that funnel action without becoming obligatory. As Wikipedia encourages and relies on the voluntary contribution of knowledge even by anonymous or inexperienced users, and as its body of editors is extremely diverse, such flexibility was crucial in allowing it to attract gifts of knowledge from diverse contributors and function as a “boundary object” (Star and Griesemer 1989) for them. The last empirical chapter explores how knowledge experts use Wikipedia and assess its reliability, based on semi-structured interviews with Israeli journalists. Here, I found a routine and universal use of Wikipedia. Simultaneously, however, the interviews revealed a systematic taboo preventing journalists from publicly acknowledging having made use of Wikipedia. Wikipedia thus functions as a hazardous yet practical shortcut to the more fundamental sources of knowledge understood to reside elsewhere, in external authoritative sources indicated by links and references framing Wikipedia's text. Journalists tend to assess the validity of the information conveyed in Wikipedia articles basing themselves on a semiotic frame found in and around the latter, and used to attest to its own credibility and legitimacy. The result, I suggest, is a mode of consumption based on practical legitimacy, i.e. a limited form of legitimization embedded in the practices of Wikipedia's users, and granting article contents a limited yet observable measure of authority, as it takes into account and encapsulates both Wikipedia's de-facto legitimacy—in the sense that \"everybody does that\"—and lack of de-jure legitimacy. Finally, the conclusion discusses the implication of Nupedia and Wikipedia's cases for the study of contemporary knowledge-giving practices, as well as for a better understanding of the latter's relations with the vision of enlightenment and notions of rationality, science and expertise commonly associated with the very concept of modernity. As for the former, I find that Wikipedia's success is related to its ability to retain a flexible and open gift repertoire congruent with its extremely dynamic social and technological online context. In contrast with Nupedia's reliance on academic-like practices, Wikipedia built on gift-practices already prevalent in the online environment it operated in, adapted them to its innovative goals, and kept them flexible enough to support various types of giving. As for the relevance of the concept of modernity, Wikipedia may seem to challenge the accepted vision of modern knowledge as it is based on the decoupling of knowledge and expertise and of theoretical and practical legitimation, two amalgams standing at the very core of modern theories and methodologies. However, it does so in a way that also keeps assuming the legitimacy of modern epistemologies, and indeed, attempts to insert itself in the legacy of previous encyclopedias. Rather than a radical rift, then, Wikipedia presents a case of more nuanced and subtle transformation. By practically moving from obligatory to privileged passage points, and from essential to practical legitimacy, it constructs a new form of epistemic culture, which draws from earlier conceptualizations of knowledge, but re-aligns the notions of knowledge and expertise in novel ways."
