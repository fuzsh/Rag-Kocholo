        "text": "Kano is a city in North West Nigeria and the capital of Kano State. It has a population of around 3.6 million (2016 estimate), giving it a busy atmosphere. It is an ancient trading city inhabited for well over a thousand years. Despite the international airport, there is little tourist trade, but there are still surprisingly many attractions to visit and, as with the rest of Nigeria, the joy is in the people and the buzz of the streets.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nKano is the largest city in northern Nigeria. The city is predominantly Muslim with a small percentage of Christians and adherents of traditional religions. Sharia law was introduced around 2001 but only applies to Muslims and punishments are rare. There have been sectarian riots, but this is mainly due to political tensions and is not targeted at foreigners.\n\nForeign currency is not usually accepted so get some Nigerian naira at a bank or an ATM.\n\nElectricity brownouts are a common problem and don't expect the cleanest of streets.\n\nThe official language is English, but the language of the street is Hausa.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nVisitors from outside Nigeria will need a visa. This costs around US$70 and you should apply to the relevant embassy or high commission at least four weeks in advance. They will need proof that you can support yourself financially and may ask for a letter from your employer.\n\nYou will need vaccinations against yellow fever, cholera, medication for malaria and other diseases.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nNigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) operates long distance express passenger train services from Port Harcourt to Kano and Lagos via Ibadan and Kaduna to Kano every Friday (as of 2021). These services offer full air conditioning to the 1st class “seater” or “sleeper” luxury saloons, with restaurant cars equipped with conveniences. There are also standard class-coaches with luggage racks. Travel time from Lagos is just over 30 hours. There's also a once-weekly service from Nguru.\n\nDelays are common and dates of service changes frequently, always check at the station.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nYellow- and blue-coloured taxis can be hired on the roadside, ensure you agree a price before leaving. More common are the motorbikes where travellers sit behind the driver. There are also some motorised rickshaws introduced for Muslim women who do not want want to sit up close to a motorbike driver.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nThe dye pits of Kano are over 500 years old and privately owned. Indigo is mixed with potassium and ash and fermented for a month before being ready to dye cloths. The indigo dyes were once used to make garments for Nigerian royalty and they are said to also be usable as medicine. You can get a short tour around the pits and they will be happy to sell you cloths and clothes dyed blue in a variety of tie dye patterns.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nClimb the old Dala or Goron Dutse hill in the centre of the city and get a 360 degree view of the ancient city from the hill top; it is where the city started and is now an underground water reservoir.\n\nKano is also the home to the several times champions of the Nigerian Premier League, Kano Pillars FC. One can join the thousands of their fanbases and watch the games in Sani Abatcha Sadium K/Mata or in the indoor stadium Sabon Gari for as little as US$5.\n\nThe state-owned Marhaba Cinema is also located just behind the Immigration office and phone & electronics gadget village of Farm centre\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state government is investing heavily in the computing industry and has built a new ICT park, named after the past emir Alhaji, Dr. Ado Bayero, but due to change of administration, the building (Gidan Ado Bayero) has now been transformed into a state university (Yusuf Maitama Sule University) which will serve as a temporary site for the university.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a few supermarkets but in the daytime it is more exciting is to buy from one of the formal markets around town such as the famously known Kantin Kwari Market and Kofar Wambai Market. At dusk and until about 2AM, you can buy from any of the hundreds of stalls along the sides of the major roads. You will also be offered items to buy whenever you stop while driving.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nBuy food from any stall along the road sides. Masa are ground corn buns, they are often dipped into pepper soup.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nRestaurants are all over the centre of the city selling African dishes, fried chicken or Chinese food.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nSharia law means alcohol is hard to find. Most hotels do not serve alcohol on the premises but for a small fee you can easily get a staff member to buy some bottles of beer for consumption in your room (most hotel rooms in Kano have fridges). The area called Sabon Gari has many bars and nightclubs where alcoholic drinks are freely available and many stores where you can buy wine, or other alcoholic drinks.\n\nThere are malt drinks in cans with beer branding which are an acquired taste. There are few dairy products in the area but some milk based drinks are available. Western brands such as Coca Cola or Nescafe are common. Do not drink locally made drinks (zobo - sorrel, kunun aya - from tiger nuts) if you did not know the source, as hygiene is not concerned when preparing some of them.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nLike almost all hotels in Nigeria, you will be required to pay for your room up-front. Typically 125% of the room rate before you get the key. Ask for a receipt. The advance paid will be deducted from the bill on checking out.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nKano is a largely safe city and theft or violence to foreigners is rare. Keep valuables in a zipped pocket and do not wear overly revealing clothes. When buying outside shops you will probably need to haggle, walk away if you are unsure of the deal. People may try to swindle you so check your prices before agreeing and if anyone asks for money feel free to walk away. Do not use internet banking from anything but private computers.\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nHIV prevalence is extremely high in Kano, with medical studies reporting over 30% of the population infected. Prepare accordingly.\n\nCope\n\n[edit]"
