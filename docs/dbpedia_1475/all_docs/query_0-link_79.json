It was serialized in LaLa from 1995 to 2005 and collected in 21 tankōbon volumes by Hakusensha. It depicts the romance between \"perfect\" student Yukino Miyazawa and her academic rival Soichiro Arima, and the relationships of several of their friends.\n\nThe series is licensed and was published in English in North America by Tokyopop. The chapters from the first seven volumes were adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Gainax and J.C.Staff. Directed by Hideaki Anno, the episodes were broadcast in Japan on TV Tokyo from October 1998 to March 1999. It is licensed for distribution outside of Japan by Muse Communication[3] and Enoki Films under the title Tales at North Hills High,[4] and sub-licensed for distribution in North America by Nozomi Entertainment who released it as His and Her Circumstances.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nYukino Miyazawa is a Japanese high school first-year student who is the envy of classmates for her good grades and immaculate appearance. However, her \"perfect\" exterior is a façade, an egocentric charade she maintains to win praise. In the privacy of her own home, she is spoiled, stubborn, a slob, and studies relentlessly and obsessively to maintain her grades. On entering high school, she is knocked from her position at the top of the class by Soichiro Arima, a handsome young man whose very existence Yukino considers a threat to the praise on which she thrives, and she vows to destroy him. When Soichiro confesses that he has a crush on her, Yukino rejects him then boasts about it at home. Her observant little sister Kano points out that her rivalry with him comes from admiration, causing her to rethink her own feelings.\n\nBefore she can figure out if she hates or likes Soichiro, he visits her home and discovers her being herself. He uses the information to blackmail her into doing his student council work. At first Yukino accepts it, coming to realize that he is also not the perfect student he pretends to be. Tired of being used, Yukino revolts and Soichiro apologizes, and admits he still loves her and just wanted to spend time with her. Yukino realizes she loves him as well, and together they resolve to abandon their fake ways and be true to themselves, though she initially has trouble breaking her lifelong habit of pretend-perfection and her competitive ways. She battles with this newfound love and the feelings of being two-faced.\n\nAs the series progresses, Yukino is able to open her true self to others and earns her first real friends beyond Soichiro. It is eventually revealed that Soichiro was striving to be perfect in order to avoid turning \"bad\" like the parents who abandoned him. Falling in love with Yukino, he is able to become more true to himself, but he also finds himself becoming increasingly jealous of Yukino's change bringing new friends and new activities into her life, and of her having parts of her life that don't involve him. When Yukino unknowingly hurts him, he becomes even more jealous and afraid, and begins to wear another façade of the \"perfect boyfriend\" in an effort to protect her from his \"ugly\" self.\n\nThe return of both of his parents into his life sends Soichiro into a dark area, but helps him finally break free to truly be himself as Yukino and their friends help him learn to lean on and trust others. The end of the series shows Yukino and Soichiro in their 30s, with their three children, and gives updates on the various friends they made along the way.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nKare Kano was Masami Tsuda's first lengthy manga series. Still new to professional manga writing in general, shortly after starting the series she had to put it on hold while she finished working out the framework of the story and where she ultimately wanted it to go.[5]\n\nIn adapting the first seven volumes into an anime television series, director Hideaki Anno kept the same general scenes and dialogue but modified the overall feel and focus of the series, making it into a \"personal case study of relationships.\" He emphasizes the dialog over the animation using a variety of techniques, including iconic scenes, production sketches, real-life location shots, repeated imagery, and even using animation versions of manga panels or simply printing the lines of the dialog being spoken over static screens.[5]\n\nAnno is credited as director for the first 16 episodes and co-director with Hiroki Sato for later episodes but with his name written in katakana as アンノヒデアキ (anno hideaki) possibly as a form of protest. Kare Kano would be the last anime series that Anno would direct for Gainax. Michael S. Johnson of Nausicaa.net reports having heard from Gainax staff member that Anno objected to the restrictions placed on television anime by TV Tokyo after the Pokémon seizure incident.[6] In an interview Hiroyuki Yamaga claimed that Gainax found it difficult to work with a series that is based on an original work stating\n\nKare Kano was supposed to be romantic comedy and we wanted to emphasize the comedy and not the romance. The author wanted to emphasize them both and that is where the conflict came to be. We would like to continue to work on it but we have upset the author, so it is very unlikely that there will be a continuation of the series. I am very sorry.[7]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nManga\n\n[edit]\n\nWritten by Masami Tsuda, Kare Kano was first serialized in LaLa between December 22, 1995 and May 10, 2005.[5][8] The 101 individual chapters, referred to as \"Acts\", were compiled into 21 tankōbon volumes by Hakusensha. The first volume was released on June 5, 1996, with the final volume released on August 5, 2005. It also had a one-shot published on June 23, 2011.[9]\n\nKare Kano was initially licensed for an English language release by Mixx Entertainment in 2000, but it subsequently lost those rights before publication began.[10] In July 2001, the company's Tokyopop division announced that it had reacquired the license and that it would be serializing the title in their Smile magazine starting in 2002.[11] However, Smile was discontinued in 2002 before the Tokyopop released the first collected volume of the series on January 21, 2003; the final volume was released on January 10, 2007.[12][13] It was one of the first manga series that Tokyopop released in the original Japanese orientation, in which the book is read from right to left, and with the original sound effects left in place.[14] In February 2008, Tokyopop reissued the first three volumes in a single omnibus volume.\n\nThe series is licensed for regional language releases by Editions Tonkam in France by Grupo Editorial Vid in Mexico, by Glènat España in Spain, by Dynamic Italia in Italy, by Carlsen Comics in Germany, by Panini Comics in Brazil, and by Planet Manga in Portugal. The chapters were also serialized in the French magazine Magnolia [fr] and the German magazine Daisuki.\n\nAnime\n\n[edit]\n\nKare Kano was adapted as an anime television series produced by Gainax and J.C.Staff. The series was directed by Hideaki Anno. The 26 episodes were broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1998 to March 1999. The opening theme was \"Tenshi no Yubikiri\" by Fukuda Mai, and the ending themes were \"Yume no Naka e\" by Atsuko Enomoto & Chihiro Suzuki for episodes 1–24 and 26 and \"Kaze Hiita Yoru\" by Yuki Watanabe & Maria Yamamoto for episode 25.\n\n# Title Directed by Written by Original airdate 1\"Her Circumstances\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Kanojo no jijō\" (Japanese: 彼女の事情)Ken AndōHideaki AnnoOctober 2, 1998 ( )\n\nMiyazawa Yukino is the most popular girl in school, but in real life she is a spoiled, lazy, stubborn, and unmanageable.

One day, they ran away because of a huge debt they had and left Arima alone. He was adopted by his father's older brother and they took good care of him. He felt that he could not open up to them properly because he was always trying hard to keep up a fake face to make sure no one judged him because of his parents.
