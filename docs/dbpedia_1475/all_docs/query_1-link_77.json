        "text": "The Kano model is a tool every product manager should know.\n\nImagine you’re cooking a special meal. You need to know which ingredients are essential and which ones will give that extra zing. That’s what the Kano model does for product features.\n\nWhy is it important? It’s about making smart, impactful choices. This model helps you figure out which features will satisfy your customers, which will delight them, and which might let them down. It’s a practical approach to understanding customer needs and exceeding their expectations.\n\nReady to explore how the Kano model can change the game for you in product management? Let’s get started!\n\nWhat is the Kano model?\n\nThe Kano model is a prioritization framework that product managers use to plan the roadmap. It helps product development and customer satisfaction as well. To use the Kano model, you need to categorize customer preferences into different levels. This helps to determine how various aspects of a product can influence customer satisfaction.\n\nHistory of the Kano model\n\nDr. Noriaki Kano, a Japanese professor, created the Kano model in 1984. His goal was simple yet powerful: understand what makes customers happy.\n\nDr. Kano’s idea was groundbreaking. He saw that not all features in a product are equal in customers’ eyes. Some are must-haves, while others are nice surprises. His model aimed to identify these different factors.\n\nThe core of the Kano model is customer satisfaction. It’s all about figuring out what customers expect, what they love, and what they can do without. Since 1984, this model has been a key tool in product management. It helps teams make products that people not only use but also enjoy.\n\nDr. Kano’s insights from decades ago still guide product managers today.\n\nUnderstanding the Kano model\n\nThe Kano model breaks down features into categories based on how they affect customer satisfaction.\n\nKano model categories\n\nFirst, there are ‘Basic’ features. Think of these as the essentials. If these are missing or done poorly, customers are unhappy. They’re like the foundation of a house – without them, everything else falls apart.\n\nNext, we have ‘Performance’ features. These are directly linked to customer satisfaction. The better these features are, the happier your customers will be. It’s a straightforward deal: improve these features and improve satisfaction.\n\nThen, there are the ‘Excitement’ features. Sometimes people call these “Delighters.’ These are the surprise elements. Customers don’t expect them, but they love them when they’re there. These features can turn a good product into an amazing one.\n\nThe critical role of the Kano Model in feature prioritization is balancing these categories. It’s not just about adding more features. It’s about understanding which features will bring the most satisfaction to your customers.\n\n‘Indifferent’ features are those that customers don’t particularly care about. Their presence or absence doesn’t significantly affect satisfaction. They’re like the color of a basement – not a deal-breaker for most.\n\nLastly, there are ‘Reverse’ features. These are unique in that customers might actually be dissatisfied if they are present. It’s like adding too much spice to a dish – it can be a turn-off for some.\n\nLet’s walk through an example. Imagine you’re creating an app.\n\nUsing the Kano model, you’d ensure the app nails sending and receiving emails first. Next, you’d work on a robust spam filter. Finally, you’d add AI-powered replies to really stand out.\n\nThe evolution of features in the Kano model\n\nIn the Kano model, features evolve over time. What starts as an excitement feature can become a basic necessity. It’s all about how customer expectations change.\n\nFrom excitement to basic\n\nInitially, a feature might wow customers because it’s new and unexpected. Over time, as it becomes more common, customers expect it as standard. It moves from an ‘Excitement’ feature to a ‘Basic’ feature.\n\nExample: mobile phone battery life\n\nWhen mobile phones first came out, a long-lasting battery was a delight. Users were thrilled with batteries that lasted more than a few hours. This used to be an ‘Excitement’ feature.\n\nNow, a long battery life is a must. It’s no longer a delight; it’s expected (‘Basic’ feature). If a phone doesn’t last a full day, it’s seen as a drawback.\n\nThis evolution reflects how technology and user expectations change. What was once a luxury becomes a standard. Understanding this shift is crucial for product managers. It helps in planning future feature enhancements and staying ahead in the market.\n\nImplementing the Kano model\n\nUsing the Kano model effectively means getting into your customers’ heads. Here’s how you can do it.\n\nCustomer surveys and feedback for categorization\n\nSurveys are your best tool. They let you hear directly from your customers. This feedback is gold for categorizing features into Basic, Performance, and Excitement.\n\nCraft effective surveys\n\nKeep it simple. Ask straightforward, direct questions. Make sure each question targets a specific feature. Your goal is to understand how much each feature matters to your customers.\n\nAsk the right questions\n\nUse functional (positive) and dysfunctional (negative) questions. For example, ask: “How would you feel if this feature were available?” and “How would you feel if this feature were not available?” This approach helps you gauge the impact of each feature.\n\nAnalyze responses\n\nLook for patterns. Which features are consistently seen as must-haves? Which ones bring excitement? Responses will show you which features are vital, which are nice-to-haves, and which might not be necessary.\n\nRicardo Vargas highlights how the Kano model can effectively prioritize product features based on their potential to satisfy clients. Check out his podcast to hear more from him.\n\nContinuous customer feedback\n\nIn product management, staying in tune with your customers is critical. Here’s how continuous feedback plays a crucial role.\n\nAdaptive feature categorization\n\nCustomer needs evolve. What’s exciting today might be basic tomorrow. Regular feedback helps you re-categorize features as customer preferences change.\n\nOngoing engagement\n\nKeep the conversation going. Regular check-ins with users keep your product aligned with their needs. It’s like having a constant pulse on what your customers really want.\n\nData-driven decisions\n\nLet feedback guide you. Analyze the data to understand trends and patterns. This approach ensures your decisions are backed by solid customer insights, not just gut feelings.\n\nEmbracing continuous feedback helps you stay agile. You’ll be better equipped to adapt features, engage with your customers, and make decisions that hit the mark.\n\nCanny’s feedback management software offers a complete tool for feedback and product management.

Here’s how to weave it into your product roadmap.\n\nAlign with strategic goals\n\nMatch feedback with your long-term vision. Ensure that customer insights support the broader objectives of your product. It’s about finding that sweet spot where customer needs and business goals meet.\n\nPrioritize features\n\nUse feedback to rank features. Look at what your customers say and weigh it against your product’s capabilities. Focus on features that align with customer desires and your strategic goals.\n\nKano model insights guiding UX design\n\nThe Kano model offers valuable insights for enhancing UX/UI design.\n\nFeedback on ‘Excitement’ features can inspire creative UX/UI enhancements. They’re about adding elements that users don’t expect, but love once experienced.\n\nImprove user interface aspects that directly impact user satisfaction. This might include streamlining processes or enhancing the interface’s efficiency.\n\nThese insights ensure that every design element meets user needs and contributes to an engaging and satisfying user experience.\n\nReal-world examples\n\nThat’s all great in theory. But how does it actually work? Here are some examples of well-known companies using and implementing the Kano model.\n\nApple\n\nKnown for its innovative products, Apple often includes delighters in its product launches. For example, the introduction of the touch screen on the iPhone was a delighter that exceeded customer expectations.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon’s introduction of free two-day delivery for Prime members started as a delighter and became a must-have feature for online shoppers.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix introduced personalized recommendations based on viewing history, creating a delighter for its customers. This feature not only exceeded customer expectations but also increased customer loyalty and retention. Additionally, Netflix’s introduction of original content, such as the hit series “Stranger Things,” was a performance attribute that satisfied customer needs and expectations.\n\nChallenges and best practices in implementing the Kano model\n\nImplementing the Kano method has its challenges. Here’s how to navigate them effectively.\n\nAddressing biases\n\nBe aware of biases in customer feedback. Diverse sources of feedback can help balance these biases. Considering a wide range of user perspectives is crucial to get a true sense of needs and desires.\n\nResource allocation\n\nBalance is key. Invest in basic features for stability, performance features for satisfaction, and excitement features for delight. Prioritize based on customer impact versus resource investment.\n\nBy being mindful of these aspects, you can effectively utilize the Kano method to enhance your product development strategy.\n\nKano model versus other frameworks\n\nThere’s no one perfect framework. We’re breaking down the Kano method in this article. But other methodologies are worth mentioning too. Let’s see how the Kano model compares to other popular approaches.\n\nMost product managers use a combination of a few frameworks. Sometimes, they’d use one methodology for one feature and a different approach for another feature. Other times, they distinguish approaches based on the teams they’re working with.\n\nSometimes, a larger company has a few products, so a product manager can select the best framework for each.\n\nThe best thing you can do is understand each framework. Then, you’ll know which method is best for each unique situation.\n\nWe put together a complete guide to prioritization to help you. It gives you an overview of the most popular prioritization frameworks. Picking a framework is much easier when you can compare them all at a glance.\n\nKano model in today’s product management\n\nThe Kano model remains a vital tool in modern product management. Here’s why.\n\nToday’s market demands products that meet basic needs and offer something extra. The Kano model helps identify what ‘extra’ means for customers, keeping products competitive and relevant.\n\nBalancing feature investment with customer delight is all about wise investment. The model guides where to put resources for the most significant impact on customer satisfaction. This balance is crucial for delivering products that not only function well but also bring joy to users.\n\nIn an era where customer expectations constantly evolve, the Kano model helps product managers stay ahead. It ensures the products are both efficient and delightful.\n\nConclusion: why you should use the Kano model\n\nThe Kano model isn’t just a framework; it’s a roadmap to customer satisfaction.
