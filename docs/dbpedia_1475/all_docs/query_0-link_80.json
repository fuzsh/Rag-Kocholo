Rumfa later became King and moved to a new palace but subsequent Makamas lived in the building. After the British capture of Kano in 1903, the place briefly served as an office for the colonial officers in Kano.[6] The structure was later divided into three parts. One section became a museum ran by the Department of Antiquities, another became a primary school and a third maintained the original intention as a residential building.[6] Gidan Makama is now part of museums under management of the National Commission of Museums and Monuments and one of the old structures depicting traditional Hausa architecture. The structure originally contained mud walls typical of the Hausa tradition in that period but in later years some modern renovation work has taken place.\n\nMuseum\n\n[edit]\n\nThe museum is located on Emir Palace road and it is divided into 11 galleries with each containing some aspects of traditional Kanawa artifacts, pictures, musical instruments, handicraft and materials.[7] The galleries are the rooms and courtyards of the old Makamas and depicts the style of a traditional residence of a Kano aristocrat. The entrance of the gates exhibited some historical pots believed to have been excavated at Kofar Kabuga, a gate within the Kano city wall and also two colonial cannons. The building hosts 11 galleries.\n\nGalleries\n\n[edit]\n\nSource:[6]\n\nThe museum has 11 galleries each containing materials, artifacts and pictures representing the historical heritage of the people.\n\nFirst gallery is about Hausa traditional architecture and includes building materials used by the people of Kano\n\nSecond has the Kofar kabuga gates through which the British entered and subsequently captured Kano; it also has a map showing the walls of Kano\n\nThird exhibits a traditional religious history of Kano in pictures and the story of the early invaders of Kano led by Bagauda\n\nFourth depicts the Fulani influenced history of Kano starting from the 19th century\n\nFifth tells the story of theKano Civil war\n\nSixth tells the story of old Kano economy and the Durbar\n\nSeventh has the colonial period and pictorial history of 20th century political figures\n\nEighth includes the Islamic heritage of the people of Kano\n\nNinth shows various occupations of the people of Kano and includes farm instruments, basketwork and textiles\n\nTenth has music instruments\n\nEleventh depicts the traditional Hausa bride's room.\n\nSome of the historical items that are kept at Gidan Makama"
