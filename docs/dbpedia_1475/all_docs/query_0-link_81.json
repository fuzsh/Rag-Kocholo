        "text": "The 11th Sarki was Yaji, called Ali. His mother was Maganarku. He was called Yaji because he had a bad temper when he was a boy, and the name stuck to him.\n\nHe drove the Serikin Rano from Zamna Gaba, went to Rano, and reigned at Bunu 2 years. Then he removed to Kur together with the Ajawa and Worjawa and Aurawa. He stayed there.\n\nIn Yaji's time the Wongarawa came from Mele, bringing the Muhammadan religion. The name of their leader was Abdurahaman Zaite. Others were Yakubu, Mandawali, Famori, Bilkasim, Kanaji, Bukere, Sheshe, Kebe, Murtuku, Liman Jibjin Yallabu, the father of Serikin Pawa, Gurdumus, Auta, Laual, Liman Madatai and others—about 40 in all. When they came they commanded the Sarki to observe the times of prayer. He complied, and made Gurdamus his Liman, and Laual his Muezzin. Auta cut the throats of whatever flesh was eaten. Mandawali was Liman of all the Wongarawa and of the chief men of Kano. Zaite was their Alkali.\n\nThe Sarki commanded every town in Kano country to observe the times of prayer. So they all did so. A mosque was built beneath the sacred tree facing east, and prayers were made at the five appointed times in it.\n\nThe Sarkin Gazarzawa was opposed to prayer, and when the Moslems after praying had gone home, he would come with his men and defile the whole mosque and cover it with filth. Danbugi was told off to patrol round the mosque with well-armed men from evening until morning. He kept up a constant halloo. For all that the pagans tried to win him and his men over. Some of his men followed the pagans and went away, but he and the rest refused. The defilement continued till Sheshe said to Famori, “There is no cure for this but prayer.” The people assented. They gathered together on a Tuesday in the mosque at the evening hour of prayer and prayed against the pagans until sunrise. They only came away when the sun was well up. Allah received graciously the prayers addressed to him. The chief of the pagans was struck blind that day, and afterwards all the pagans who were present at the defilement—they and all their women. After this they were all afraid.\n\nYaji turned the chief of the pagans out of his office and said to him, “Be thou Sarki among the blind.” In the days of Yaji, it is said, Sarkin Debbi, Sarkin Dab and Sarkin Gano brought horses to Kano, but this story is not worthy of credence.\n\nYaji said to the Wongarawa,“I want you to make prayer so that I may conquer the men of Santolo, for if I conquer Santolo every town in the country will follow me, since Santolo is the key of the south.”\n\nThey said, “We will pray for you—but we will not pray except beside the moat of Santolo itself.”\n\nSo the Sarki set forth together with the Wongarawa, and they went to Santolo. He had with him 111 men. 50 of them were in front of the Wongarawa and 60 in front of himself. The chief among his men were Jarumai Gobarra Dagga Samma, Jakafada Kulli, Ragumar Giwa, Makama Butache, Maidawaki Koamna, Berdi Sheggi, Sarki Zaura Gamati, Dan Buram Gantururu, Dan Maköo Dagazo, Galadima Tuntu and Sarkin Surdi Maguri. Others were Gauji, Garoji, Tankarau, Kargagi, Karfasha, Kutunku Toro, Kampachi, Gorongiwa the Galadima, Zaki, Bamboli and others—altogether 60.\n\nNow when he came to Santolo, the Sarki camped near Duji. Duji was the name of a man. In the dead of night the Wongarawa went to Santolo together with Yaji and marched round the city and prayed till daybreak. When the day broke they returned to their camp. When the sun was up they returned to Santolo eager for battle. The men of Santolo came out of the town and met them in the open. Fighting went on from morning until night. Neither side prevailed. The Kanawa retired to Duji; the men of Santulu returned to their homes. The Sarkin Kano was very sore at heart. Famori said, “Do not be grieved! if Allah so wills we will defeat them.”\n\nThe Sarki was pleased with his talk. Kosa, the Sarki’s slave, said, “My lord, I will tell you the secrets of the enemy; there are 8 men inside the city and no one can pass the moat unless he kills them.”\n\nFamori said, “Do you know their names?”\n\nHe said, “I know them.”\n\nSo Famori said, “What are their names?”\n\nAnd Kosa replied, “The name of the greatest is Hambari, and after him Gwoshin Bauna, Kafiwuta, Gurgurra Karifi, Gandar Giwa, Hamburkin Toka, Zan Kaddakere and Gumbar Wakke.”\n\nGwoji said, “If I see Hambari I will kill him, if Allah so wills.”\n\nAt sunrise the Sarki returned to the attack on Santolo with black looks. He took a spear in his hand. Gwoji was in front of him, Zaite was on his right hand, Famori on his left, and behind him was Sheshe. Behind them were the rest of the Wongarawa and Kanawa. When they came near to Santolo all the pagans came out to battle. Gwoji saw Hambari, and girding up his loins dashed into the fray. The pagans rushed at Gwoji, but he withstood them, and when they gave way, lunged at Hambari with his spear. Hambari caught him by the throat and dragged him from his horse; but in vain, for Gwoji drew his knife, and ran him through, and so he died. Then Gwoji mounted his horse and entered Santolo, and all the Kanawa followed him and stormed the town. The Sarki commanded all the inhabitants to be killed except women and little children. Gwoji entered the place of their god, with Kosa and Guragu, and found a bell, and two horns, a battle-axe and leg-irons. Gwoji took the bell and the two horns. Kosa took the battle-axe, and Guragu the leg-irons. Yaji stayed seven days in the town and destroyed the place of sacrifice, and after dismantling its wall and tree, returned to Kano. He said to Gwoji, “Choose whatever you want.”\n\nGwoji said, “I only want to become Madawakin Kano.”\n\nThe Sarki said, “I give you the office.”\n\nGasatoro, who was turned out of the post of Madawaki, built a house at Gawo, and for that reason was known as Madawakin Gawo, to distinguish the two.\n\nThe next year the Sarki went to war with Warji and stayed there some time. At this time all the pagan tribes were subject to him, from Biyri to Panda. The Kworarafa alone refused to follow him, so he went to their country. When he came to their town, they were afraid to fight and all fled up the hill at Tagara. The Sarki camped there also for seven months. Ko one came down from the rock. At last the pagans paid him a hundred slaves. Because of this the song in praise of Yaji was made, which runs: “Yaji, conqueror of the rocky heights, scatterer of hosts, lord of the town.” It is said that he died here at Kworarafa. Perhaps he died at Kano.\n\nHe ruled 37 years."
