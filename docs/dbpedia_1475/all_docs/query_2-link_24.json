        "text": "Italian disco band formed in Milan, Italy in 1979\n\nFor the grime musician, see Kano (British musician).\n\nKano was an Italo disco music project formed in Milan, Italy in 1979 by producers/musicians Luciano Ninzatti, Stefano Pulga and Matteo Bonsanto.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKano's debut single was the 1980 international hit \"I'm Ready\", combining elements of 1970s disco, funk and R&B while extensively using synthesizers and percussive handclaps as well as raw-processed and vocoderized vocals. Kano's self-titled debut album also included \"It's a War\", \"Ahjia\", \"Now Baby Now\" and the instrumental track \"Cosmic Voyager\". \"I'm Ready\" peaked at No. 21 on the U.S. Black Singles chart, while \"It's a War\" and \"Ahjia\" were also hits on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the U.S., reaching No. 2 for five weeks.[1]\n\nThe project went on to record two other albums, including 1981's New York Cake (which included the minor hits \"She's a Star\", \"Don't Try to Stop Me\" and \"Can't Hold Back\") and 1983's Another Life (including the title track and \"I Need Love\"). Both albums introduced Kano listeners to West Indian-born singer Glen White. Their last song was 1985's \"This Is the Night\".\n\nSampling and usage in media\n\n[edit]\n\n\"I'm Ready\" was later sampled on several songs, such as Gigolo Tony's 1986 hit \"Hoki Poki\" and Rofo's 1983 hit \"Flashlight on a Disconight\"[citation needed]. The most well-known use of it as a sample is on Tag Team's 1993 hit, \"Whoomp! (There It Is)\". \"Now Baby Now\" was sampled by house artist Felix Da Housecat for his track \"Glitz Rock\" which appeared on the 2001 album Kittenz and Thee Glitz. \"Another Life\" was remixed by Master Blaster which features on their 2003 album We Love Italo Disco. \"Another Life\" was also sampled in the 2005 track \"Discopolis\" by Lifelike & Kris Menace. \"Ikeya Seki\" was sampled by French electro house artist Kavinsky for his track \"Grand Canyon\", which appeared on his 2007 EP, 1986. Finnish rapper Petri Nygård sampled \"Ahjia\" on his 2009 song \"Kotibileet\". An arpeggio from \"Another Life\" was sampled in the 2011 single \"Reaching Out\" by Nero.\n\n\"I'm Ready\" was used as an intro/outro theme in the TV interstitial TV PIXxxx on WPIX-TV Channel 11, New York City.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\nYear Album Label US US\n\nR&B 1980 Kano Emergency , Full Time Records ― 26 1981 New York Cake 189 53 1983 Another Life TELDEC , Full Time ― ― 2021 No Cents...Go Funky Full Time ― ―\n\nCompilation albums\n\nYear Album Label 1983 The Best of Kano Teldec , Full Time 1990 Greatest Hits Unidisc 1993 All The Best - The Long Versions Arcade, Mint Records 2018 Queen Of Witches (The 12” Collection) VR Records\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Name US US\n\nR&B US\n\nDance IT GER SWI 1980 \"I'm Ready\" ― 21 8 ― ― ― \"Now Baby Now\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"Ahjia\" ― ― 2 ― ― ― \"Cosmic Voyager\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"It's A War\" ― ― 2 ― ― ― 1981 \"Baby Not Tonight\" ― ― ― 3 ― ― 1982 \"Don't Try to Stop Me\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"Can't Hold Back (Your Lovin')\" 89 35 20 ― ― ― 1983 \"Another Life\" ― ― ― 23 10 8 \"Queen of Witches\" ― ― ― ― 64 ― \"Baby Not Tonight\" ― ― ― 29 ― 8 \"I Need Love\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"China Star\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"Ikeya Seki\" ― ― ― ― ― ― \"This Is the Night\" ― ― ― ― ― ―\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nKano > Billboard Singles at Allmusic.
