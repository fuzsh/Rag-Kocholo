He holds a sick infatuation with Sonya Blade, much to her disgust. He is the arch-nemesis of the Special Forces (especially Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage) and the Red Dragon Clan. He is also the arch-rival of Kabal.\n\nPortrayals[]\n\nIn the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Mortal Kombat Advance, he was portrayed by Richard Divizio, who also portrayed Baraka, Kabal, Shang Tsung and Quan Chi throughout the same games.\n\nHe was portrayed by the late Trevor Goddard in the 1995 movie.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, he was voiced by Michael Des Barres, who also portrayed Shao Kahn in the same series, Murdoc in MacGyver and Nostromos in Batman: The Animated Series.\n\nHe was voiced by David Allen in Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, Deception, Shaolin Monks and Armageddon.\n\nFrom Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe to Mortal Kombat X, he was voiced by Michael McConnohie, who also voiced Ermac in Mortal Kombat (2011), Charles zi Britannia in Code Geass, Baraggan Louisenbairn in Bleach, Seth in Street Fighter, Impostor Captain Tennille in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, the Lich King in World of Warcraft and Astaroth in Soul Calibur.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat: Legacy, he was portrayed by the late Darren Shahlavi, who also played Taylor Milos in Ip Man 2.\n\nIn Mortal Kombat 11, he was voiced by JB Blanc, who also voiced Bane in Batman: Arkham Origins and The Enemy Within, Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing, Diablo in Diablo III, The Tower of Sauron in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Alighiero Alighieri in Dante's Inferno, Romeo in Minecraft: Story Mode, Brian Irons in Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, Zinyak in Saints Row IV, Kuben Blisk in Titanfall, and Nakeem Grindina in Bleach.\n\nHe was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge and David Wenham in Snowblind.\n\nHe was portrayed by Josh Lawson in the 2021 movie.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nKano is a mercenary and Second-in-Command of the Black Dragon, one of the most dangerous, feared and respected Crime Cartels located in Earthrealm. At first, Kano appeared to be loyal to the Special Forces. However, he was revealed to be a mole for the Black Dragon all along feeding false information to the Special Forces. Many Soldiers were killed in an operation gone wrong, including Sonya's partner. Since then, Sonya has harbored a great hatred for Kano. Kano has amassed a fortune selling his arms to other realms. Kano has become one of his own realm’s biggest threats, willing to betray his own realm and even his own allies for money or personal gain.\n\nKano gives the impression of an arrogant brute, which he is, but is quite intelligent. He has infiltrated several High Security Facilities and often hacks into computer systems, retrieving the information he is looking for. He rises beyond mere brutality and aggression by being sly and cunning. Kano is highly opportunistic and incredibly selfish.\n\nOne of his most notable features is his facetious and twisted sense of humor, almost always making light of dire circumstances. He combines the features of a cowardly minion, a lone survivor, a crazed madman, and a ruthless commander. These features have contributed to Kano's constant survival against all odds.\n\nDespite his ruthless nature, Kano does care about his men, as long as they maintain their usefulness. He pays them well, so long as they do their work, and even saved Kabal's life. That said, he has no problem leaving them behind or killing them if they betray him or become less useful, revealing his care for them was nothing, but a façade and only cares about himself and no one else.\n\nBut when he is overmatched by a stronger opponent, he is shown to be an extreme coward, it is shown when he begged Scorpion for mercy in Mortal Kombat 11.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\nCybernetic Enhancement: Kano has been outfitted with cybernetic enhancements throughout his body, most notably his Cybernetic Eye which can emit a laser beam. His other enhancements help boost his power in combat.\n\nEye Laser: Kano's laser can easily burn through and kill his opponents easy.\n\nPower Boost: With all of his cybernetic enhancements, they had boosted up all of his powers like strength, speed, durability and etc.\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Kano has shown have surprising strength based on his finishers. Several of his finishers involve him ripping vital organs (or sometimes entire skeletons) out of the opponent's body. Along with the elder Sub-Zero's Spine Rip Fatality, Kano's Heart Rip helped Mortal Kombat garner significant controversy over its violence factor. He can also use his head to destroy someone else's just by headbutting them.\n\nSuperhuman Speed: Kano has shown to be very fast in combat that he was able to give Sub-Zero the scar on his face. He also shows his incredible speed based off his Cannonball special move.\n\nSuperhuman Agility\n\nSuperhuman Reflexes\n\nSuperhuman Stamina: Kano has incredible stamina, that he was able to fight Sonya and Special Forces for a very long time and has not shown any signs of exhaustion.\n\nSuperhuman Durability: Kano is also very durable based on taking powerful blows that can cause a normal human physical injury.\n\nSuperhuman Endurance\n\nAbilities[]\n\nExpert Martial Artist: Kano isn't the most disciplined fighter but has proven himself to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having received extensive training in Street Fighting, Military Combat and has trained under martial arts, but tends to resort to more of a Street Brawler style of fighting. He is not above utilizing underhanded tactics to get the upper hand in a fight. Kano is an opportunistic fighter and tends to engage in fights when it best suits him, but if challenged directly he will not shy away from the challenge. What he lacks in discipline (finesse & footwork), he makes up for it by being extremely adept in combat and has proven to be a challenge for even the more skilled fighters.\n\nStreet Fighting\n\nMilitary Combat\n\nBrawler\n\nXing Yi\n\nAikido\n\nExpert Acrobat: Kano does have skills in acrobatics like being able to do flips and can propel at his opponents by using his Cannonball move. He also can leap at great distances. He is very tricky when it comes to his athletic skills.\n\nStealth Proficency: Kano does have experience in stealth like being able to sneak up on Johnny Cage to throw him off the Pit Bridge.\n\nWeapon Mastery: He is highly proficient at using knives in combat and often carries multiple bladed weapons on him at once. He has a signature pair of knives he uses in combat, whether they are thrown at the opponent or uses them in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nHigh Intelligence: He is also very intelligent; his younger self was able to repair Sektor and produce many more Cyber Units after older Kano revealed Kronika's payment for their services. Furthermore, despite it not being canon, Kano created a virus that proved deadly enough to hack into the Special Force's systems in Jax's ending.\n\nManipulation: Kano was able to convince Kabal to quit working with police and come back to a life of crime with the Black Dragon.\n\nMaster Tactician and Strategist: Kano is a very keen strategist who can think of ways to achieve his victories. He tends to use other members of the team (Tasia, Jarek, Erron Black, Tremor, No Face & BD Thugs/Mercenaries, even his former boss Kabal) to wear down his opposition, so he can have the advantage in a fight.\n\nDeception: Kano also has some expertise in deception in order to get the quid.\n\nLeadership: Kano has shown to be a very good leader when he took command of the Black Dragon clan.\n\nIntimidation: Kano is so intimidation, that he was able to make Sonya choose if Johnny Cage would live or his yourself. He still has many other ways to make people be afraid of him.\n\nIndomitable Will: Kano is strong willed based on his burning ambitions to get paid a lot and he will take any job necessary, in order to do it. Even if it meant sacrificing his own realm.\n\nRelations[]\n\nQuotes[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKano bears some resemblance to the Terminator and Ed Boon stated that his design was based on the T-800's appearance in Terminator 2, when the Terminator's face skin is peeled off, revealing his mechanical face.\n\nWhen Kano faced the Flash, he stated that he would give Kabal a run for his money.\n\nIn the games, Kano was originally intended to be Asian, but Trevor Goddard's portrayal of Kano in the Mortal Kombat movie was well liked by the developers, who incorporated aspects of it into subsequent games.\n\nA cyborg heavily based on Kano appears at the Bad Anon meeting in the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph. He is one of the villains who reassures Ralph that the way his people treated him was part of the program, and ripped out a zombie's heart as a shout-out to the games.\n\nKano is also the moniker of a well-known UK grime MC.\n\nKano was mostly bald in the digitized Mortal Kombat games. The same is true for his past self in Mortal Kombat 11.\n\nKano is the first character named in the legendary Mortal Kombat theme.\n\n[]\n\nKano on the Mortal Kombat Wiki\n\nKano on the Wikipedia\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nMain Villains\n\nBlaze | Daegon | Dark Kahn | Havik | Kronika | Onaga | One Being | Quan Chi (2nd Timeline, New Era) | Shang Tsung (2nd Timeline, New Era) | Shao Kahn (2nd Timeline, General Shao) | Shinnok\n\nSecondary Villains\n\nCetrion | D'Vorah | Dark Raiden | Frost | Geras | Goro | Kano | Kintaro | Mileena | Noob Saibot (New Era) | Sektor | Sindel | Skarlet\n\nOther Villains\n\nBaraka (2nd Timeline) | Chameleon | Cyrax | Drahmin | Darrius | Dairou | Ermac (Order of Darkness) | Erron Black | Hotaru | Hsu Hao | Jade | Jarek | Kabal | Kira | Kobra | Kollector | Mavado | Moloch | Motaro | Nitara | Rain (New Era)| Reiko | Reptile | Scorpion | Sheeva | Smoke | Tanya | Titan Havik | Tremor | Triborg\n\nUndead Villains\n\nJade | Jax | Kabal | Kitana | Kung Lao | Kurtis Stryker | Liu Kang | Nightwolf | Sindel | Smoke | Sub-Zero\n\nGuest Star Villains\n\nAlien | Catwoman | Darkseid | Deathstroke | Freddy Krueger | Ghostface | Homelander | Jason Voorhees | John Rambo | Joker | Kratos | Leatherface | Lex Luthor | Omni-Man | Peacemaker | Predator | T-1000 | Terminator\n\nNon Playable Villains\n\nBarakion | Dark Li Mei | Female Ermac | Female Reptile | Female Scorpion | Female Sub-Zero | Fire Cage | Firefly | Forrest Fox | Frostbite | Guard of Thunder | Janet Cage | Jataaka | Jawspell | John Khaner | Johnny Savage | Kang Quan | Katara Vala | Kia | Kitana Khan | Klockodile | Lin Kuei Grandmaster | Lizard Queen | Lucifer | Malebolgia | No Face | Oni Warlord | Quan Li | Quantum-Chi | Quinn | Red Dragon | Reiko Starr | Rojack | Ruutuu | Scorp Lao | Screen Demon | Sento Storm | Shao-Zero | Shock Priestess | Stung Lao | Tasia | Warlord\n\nEvil Races\n\nCentaurians | Demons | Dragons | Hellspawn | Kytinn | Oni | Shokan | Tarkata | Tormentors | Wraiths | Zombies\n\nEvil Organizations\n\nArmy of Darkness | Black Dragon Clan | Brotherhood of Shadow | Cyber Ninjas | Dragon King's Army | Festival of Death | Forces of Darkness | Kahn Guards | Masked Guards | Red Dragon Clan | Shaakans | Shadow Assassins | Shadow Priests | Tekunin | The Deadly Alliance\n\nMovies\n\nMortal Kombat: The Journey Begins (1995): Shang Tsung | Goro\n\nMortal Kombat (1995): Shang Tsung | Kano | Goro | Sub-Zero | Scorpion | Reptile | Shao Kahn\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation: Shao Kahn | Sindel | Shinnok | Mileena | Motaro | Sheeva | Ermac | Jade | Baraka | Cyrax | Smoke | Scorpion | Sub-Zero | Reptile | Rain\n\nMortal Kombat: Rebirth: Shang Tsung | Sub-Zero | Reptile | Baraka\n\nMortal Kombat: Legacy: Gadsen | Liu Kang | Baraka\n\nMortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge: Scorpion | Quan Chi | Shang Tsung | Goro | Shao Kahn | Kano | Baraka | Reptile | Moloch | Motaro | One Being\n\nMortal Kombat (2021): Shang Tsung | Sub-Zero | Mileena | Reiko | Kano | Kabal | Goro | Reptile | Nitara\n\nMortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms: Shao Kahn | Shinnok | Shang Tsung | One Being | Scorpion | Lin Kuei Grandmaster | Sektor | Cyrax | Mileena | Smoke | Reiko | Kintaro | Jade | D'Vorah | Baraka | Li Mei\n\nMortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind: Kano | Shang Tsung | Kabal | Kira | Kobra | Erron Black | Ferra and Torr | Drahmin | No Face | Tremor | Jarek | Kronika\n\nMortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match: Shinnok | Sareena | The Director | David Doubldy | Jataaka | Kia | Drahmin | Moloch\n\nShows\n\nMortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm: Karbrac | Hideyoshi | Komodai | Oniro | Ruby | Zaggot | Zara | Zenkaro\n\nMortal Kombat: Conquest: Bannak | Baron Reyland | Cilene | Jola | Kebral | Kiri and Ankha | Noob Saibot | Quan Chi | Queen Kreeya | Peron | Qali | Shang Tsung | Scorpion | Reptile | Siann, Mika and Sora | Sub-Zero | Vorpax"
