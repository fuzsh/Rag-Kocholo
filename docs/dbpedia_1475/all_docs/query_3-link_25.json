        "text": "Wikipedia wants to hold all human knowledge on its site and make it available around the world for free. It’s a lofty goal – one that is steamrolling ahead – and it needs the help of millions of Wikipedians (editors). It’s us, regular people, that can create, edit, and maintain Wikipedia pages. We can keep the encyclopedia up-to-date and accurate, filling in all the blanks.\n\nDo you know of someone deserving of an entry in the online encyclopedia? Great! Here’s a step-by-step guide that will teach you how to make a Wikipedia page.\n\nThis might seem obvious, but sometimes people are surprised to find an article already exists. Search on Wikipedia and see what’s what. Try using the individual’s full name and nicknames. Check out any related articles (i.e. the individual’s organization, activities, historical events) and see if those articles have a subsection on the individual.\n\nDo you only have one or two more sentences to add to those subsections? If so, you can edit the article and call it a day. However, if you’ve got more, you can still draft a new article. When you do so, let other Wikipedians know what content already exists.\n\nNext, you need to review Wikipedia’s notability and COI guidelines.\n\nThe COI guidelines we touched upon in step two – no writing about yourself or your family. These guidelines are more extensive than that, though. You shouldn’t write about anyone you are friends with, or anyone you work with, even if you aren’t close with them. The fact that you both work for the same organization would raise eyebrows in Wikipedia-land, making people wonder if you are breaking the COI guideline.\n\nTo avoid this, and the fact that it can make the draft approval process much more difficult, if the individual you want to write about falls under one of these categories, you should instead request that someone else write about them.\n\nNow, what about notability guidelines? Wikipedia says it wants to present all human knowledge to the world, but it has rules around what exactly that means. Namely, subjects must be notable as defined by Wikipedia:\n\n“In short, the topic of an article must have already been the subject of publication in reliable, secondary, entirely independent sources that treat the topic in substantive detail. They might be books, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals, and similarly high-quality sources.”\n\nIf these sources don’t exist, the subject is not considered notable. This means he or she is not ready to be the subject of a Wikipedia article.\n\nOnce you know that your subject fits the bill, you get to do more research! (If you find this exhausting, Wikipedia likely isn’t for you. The need to research never stops. Maybe you can pass on what you’ve learned and what you’re hoping to achieve to someone else, who can finish this process for you.)\n\nThis time, we want you to research existing Wikipedia articles focused on individuals. At least some of these articles should be about individuals similar to your subject. If your subject started a business, look for other business founders. If they are big in the nonprofit sector, look there. Did they speak out about children’s rights? Serve in the military? Invent something?\n\nWhatever they did or do, review existing articles for similar people. See how the pages are organized, how short they are, and what type of content is included. Also make note of any issue tags. These tell you if the page is well-written and well-constructed, or if it needs some help.\n\nLearn by example. See both what your draft should do, and what it should avoid.\n\nNothing on Wikipedia happens without reliable sources. These sources serve two purposes:\n\nThey prove that the subject is notable\n\nThey ensure that all copy on Wikipedia is verifiable\n\nWikipedia is not an opinion platform. It is an encyclopedia. All information must be factual and verifiable: “Information on Wikipedia must be verifiable; if no reliable third-party sources can be found on a topic, then it should not have an article.”\n\nWhat type of sources are allowed?\n\nA few examples include:\n\nAcademic and peer-reviewed publications\n\nUniversity-level textbooks\n\nBooks published by respected publishing houses\n\nMagazines\n\nJournals\n\nMainstream newspapers\n\nAlmanacs\n\nEncyclopedias (but not Wikipedia)\n\nAn important note: in order to prevent COI, you cannot use any publication that was written by the person you have chosen as your subject. You also cannot use:\n\nPress releases\n\nSites with user-generated content\n\nCall transcripts\n\nPersonal blogs\n\nSocial media\n\nCheck here for more on reliable Wikipedia sourcing.\n\nYou don’t have to create an account to create a draft, but it does make things easier. Without an account, your IP address will be publicly visible when you edit the draft. With an account, your username will be visible, but not your IP address.\n\nIf you choose to create an account, it must be autoconfirmed before you can move forward with article creation. This will happen when your account is at least 4 days old and you have made at least 10 edits. Edits can be as simple as fixing punctuation on existing articles. To find pages that need edits, visit the Community Portal. Scroll down until you see the “Help out” section.\n\nWhen you’ve finished creating your draft, it’s time to submit it for review. There should be a “Submit for review” button on the draft. If for some reason there isn’t, add this text to the top of your draft: {{subst:submit}} This will submit it for you.\n\nA reviewer will take a look. They might approve your draft and move it to the main article space, give you feedback on how to improve it, or recommend it for deletion. If the latter two, take in their comments. Ask any questions that you have. Be respectful. Your draft might be ready after some revisions; or you might need to wait for your subject to become more notable.\n\nThis review process can take a long time. At the time this blog post was published, there were 2,450 pending submissions awaiting review. To improve your odds of a speedy review, tag your draft with relevant WikiProject tags. These tags let reviewers know that a new draft has been submitted in their area(s) of interest."
