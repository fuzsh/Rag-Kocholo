This study analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on childhood vaccination in Northern Nigeria.\n\nMethods Using a mixed methods sequential study design in the most populous northern states of Kaduna and Kano, quantitative routine immunisation data for the period 2018–2021 and qualitative data collected through 16 focus group discussions and 40 key informant interviews were used. An adaptation of the socioecological model was used as a conceptual framework. Mean vaccination coverages and test of statistical difference in childhood vaccination data were computed. Qualitative data were coded and analysed thematically.\n\nResults Mean Penta 1 coverage declined in Kaduna from 69.88% (SD=21.02) in 2018 to 59.54% (SD=19.14%) by 2021, contrasting with Kano where mean Penta 1 coverage increased from 51.87% (SD=12.61) to 56.32% (SD=17.62%) over the same period. Outreaches and vaccination in urban areas declined for Kaduna state by 10% over the pandemic period in contrast to Kano state where it showed a marginal increase. The two states combined had an estimated 25% of the country’s zero-dose burden in 2021. Lockdowns, lack of transport and no outreaches which varied across the states were some of the factors mentioned by participants to have negatively impacted childhood vaccination. Special vaccination outreaches were among the recommendations for ensuring continued vaccination through a future pandemic.\n\nConclusion While further interrogating the accuracy of denominator estimates for the urban population, incorporating findings into pandemic preparedness and response will ensure uninterrupted childhood vaccination during emergencies.

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected health systems and service delivery in several ways. A better understanding of its impact on childhood vaccination coverage and equity is crucial in recovering lost ground and building a more resilient primary healthcare (PHC) system. With a rapidly growing population of over 220 million and over 7 million infants in 2023, Nigeria has one of the world’s highest population targets for routine childhood vaccination.1 As such, ensuring equitable vaccination reach in this country is of paramount importance in global disease control efforts and in reaching global immunisation and development goals. The current national Expanded Programme on Immunisation schedule has several more vaccines than in the early days of the programme including BCG, DPT-containing vaccine—DTwP-Hib-HepB (pentavalent) and measles-containing vaccine (MCV), among others, target the most serious childhood diseases afflicting children in the country including tuberculosis, diphtheria, pneumonia and measles.2 These vaccines included within the national immunisation schedule are free at the point of care in Nigeria.3 While much progress has been made in improving coverage and reaching millions of children with vaccines, challenges remain, including structural, administrative and accountability issues related to vaccine stockouts, cold chain deficit and limited funding for outreach activities, among others.4 These challenges limit the ability to provide uninterrupted access to and usage of vaccines by the clients. There has been a consistent variation in coverage, with the lowest-performing states being predominantly in the northern part of the country, as shown by national data and surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys.5 The disproportionately larger population of Northern Nigeria means that very low vaccination coverage rates in that part of the country drag the national coverage. Studies have shown that the low vaccination coverage in the north could be attributed in part to the relatively lower socioeconomic variables in the northern region.5 6\n\nThe National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), a parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Health, is responsible for national primary healthcare policies, including for immunisation, which is then implemented through the State Primary Healthcare Development Agencies.4 7 Some of the functions of these agencies include health worker capacity building, microplanning sessions, supportive supervision, community awareness and programme monitoring. Nigeria procures vaccines through UNICEF with most vaccines self-funded while some are co-financed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.8 In 2014, the country vaccination supply chain system was redesigned, to include a system with three national strategic cold stores located in Kano, Abuja and Lagos from where vaccines go directly to the states.9–11 This supply chain system redesign was meant to improve supply chain efficiency and guarantee vaccine security.\n\nThe WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunisation coverage (WUENIC) data for Nigeria in 2021 showed a national DPT3 vaccination coverage of 56%, a first dose of DPT-containing vaccine (DPT1) coverage of 70% and a first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage of 59%.12 This means that over 3 million infants did not receive at least three complete doses of the DPT-containing vaccine. For over two decades, the national vaccination coverage has remained stagnant with persistently low performance seen in the northern part of the country5 attributed in part to the relatively lower socioeconomic variables in that region.5 6 Other contributing factors included poor service quality, accountability issues leading to vaccine stockouts, supply chain deficit, hesitancy and limited outreach activities, among others.4 6 Beyond variations across states and local government areas (LGAs), differences in vaccination coverage persist across gender, geography and literacy status of caregivers.13 14\n\nThe Immunisation Agenda 2030 has coverage and equity as one of its strategic priority areas (SP3) with a target to reduce the number of zero-dose children by 50% by 2030.15 Children who have not received the first dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP1) vaccine are considered zero-dose and an important marker for multiple deprivation. Children who have received DPT1 but not the third dose (DTP3) are considered under-vaccinated. Measuring (in)equity entails computing the absolute or relative coverage differences between vaccination antigens such as DPT1, DPT3 and MCV1.16\n\nThe global vaccination trend over the pandemic period showed a decline with an additional 6 million zero-dose and under-vaccinated children reported globally.17 The pandemic and its response measures were projected to cause a decline in vaccination coverage in Nigeria as well.18 As of April 2022, the government of Nigeria reported over 255 000 cases of COVID-19, with some states such as Kaduna, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) having large burdens.19 An exhaustive search of the published literature on studies analysing the impact of the pandemic in Nigeria revealed mostly modelling and multicountry studies, with a few Nigeria-specific studies, with none of the studies focusing in-depth on the northern part of the country.20–22\n\nSo far, not much evidence has been generated to demonstrate the extent to which these inequities have been exacerbated or ameliorated in low-income and middle-income countries. This study specifically assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response activities on childhood vaccination coverage and equity in Kaduna and Kano states of Northern Nigeria. The two states are the most populous in the north and representative of Northern Nigeria by harbouring a substantial proportion of the region’s ethnicities and religious diversity.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nA mixed-methods sequential explanatory design (quantitative–qualitative) was used,23 with the secondary analysis of the quantitative administrative routine immunisation data and the qualitative analysis based on primary data collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) using semi-structured questionnaires. The method was chosen to allow for incorporating the available programme data and explaining observed trends and patterns using the qualitative data collected. Following a review of five theoretical frameworks,24–28 an adaptation of the socioecological model by Bronfenbrenner was used as the conceptual framework shown in figure 1. This framework was chosen to provide an opportunity for detailed interrogation to better understand both the health system and caregiver perspectives.\n\nSubjects and settings\n\nThis study was conducted in Kaduna and Kano states of Northern Nigeria estimated to have a combined population of about 25 million people, the two most populous states aside from Lagos with a combined area of more than 66 000 km2, almost the size of Switzerland and Belgium combined. Inhabitants are 80–90% Muslims, largely inhabited by the Hausa-Fulani, with minority tribes such as Kurama, Jaba and Gbagi mostly in Kaduna state. The major cities are Kano, Kaduna and Zaria cities. Both states have similar socio-demographic characteristics, and these have a huge impact on their access to and usage of social services. This makes them representative of the Northern Nigeria population.\n\nQuantitative routine vaccination coverage data for BCG, Penta 1, Penta 3 and MCV1 for all the (23+44) LGAs in the two states of Kaduna and Kano were retrieved from the government national health information system—District Health Information System II (DHIS2). These are childhood vaccination data collected at the service delivery point which is then aggregated and entered into the DHIS2 at the LGA level. BCG is the first vaccine given to the child and protects against tuberculosis, Penta 1 and Penta 3 are DPT-containing vaccines protecting against five diseases including pneumonia and hepatitis B, while MCV1 is towards the end of the vaccination schedule and protects against measles. This data was made available and downloaded on an Excel sheet using temporary access to the DHIS2 platform provided by the relevant government agency to the first author based on request. Soba and Kaduna North LGAs from Kaduna state, and Nasarawa and Rimin Gado LGAs from Kano state were chosen purposively using Penta 3 coverage data groupings into four coverage groups: <50% (low), 50–75% (medium), 76–89% (high) and ≥90% (very high); keeping a 1:1 urban–rural representation with Kaduna north and Nasarawa LGAs being urban, and Soba and Rimin Gado as rural LGAs.\n\nPrimary qualitative data was collected through 16 FGDs and 40 KIIs. Participants for the KII were immunisation experts chosen based on availability and relevance to the programme across government and partner agencies at the state and LGAs, with health facility managers included as well. Frontline vaccinators and caregivers of eligible infants from 2018 to 2021 were selected for the FGD sessions from within or around selected health facilities based on willingness to participate and availability. Two health facilities were chosen per LGA for the FGD sessions making a total of eight health facilities across the four LGAs in the two states. For each health facility, two FGD sessions were conducted, one each for health workers and caregivers. The first author who is originally from Kaduna state, led data collection by working with one local assistant. The qualitative primary data will help provide in-depth insight into vaccination coverage patterns and inequities.\n\nData collection\n\nRoutine vaccination data accessed from the DHIS2 platform was used for the secondary analysis. Semi-structured questionnaires framed around our conceptual framework were developed for the collection of primary qualitative data through FGDs and KIIs (see, online supplemental appendices 1 and 2, respectively). Quiet and well-lit locations at the clinics or near clinics were used for the FGD sessions. Verbal consent was obtained from each participant for the FGDs and KIIs (see, online supplemental appendices 3 and 4, respectively).\n\nSupplemental material\n\nFor each of the eight health facilities, two FGD sessions were held—one each for the caregivers and health workers. Each FGD session had between 6 and 12 participants, with a total of 129 caregivers and health workers participating in the 16 FGD sessions across both states. The KII questionnaire had 5 Likert-type and five open-ended questions which were applied to each of the 40 KII participants.\n\nFGD sessions were conducted in both English and Hausa (local language) and recorded using a portable GARMAY digital voice recorder. KII questionnaires were responded to individually and written in English by the selected participants. Each FGD participant was supported with transport fare and lunch funded by the first author.\n\nData processing and analysis\n\nA mixed-methods approach was used for data analysis with a qualitative contrasting case analysis where the descriptive analysis of the quantitative administrative vaccination coverage data guided the selection of the qualitative data collection sites and analysis based on observed patterns.29 30 Contrasting case analysis allows for a detailed comparison of observed similarities and differences across cases and helps to bridge the quantitative and qualitative data in answering the research question. The qualitative data was then used to assess differences and similarities based on select components of the socioecological model. To facilitate smooth data analysis, the three preparatory steps of data validation, data editing and data coding were applied as appropriate.\n\nRoutine vaccination coverage data for all 23 LGAs and 44 LGAs in Kaduna and Kano states, respectively, were compiled in a Microsoft Excel sheet and uploaded to SPSS V.29 by IBM for analysis. Vaccination coverage proportions were computed for each of the vaccine antigens and each of the LGAs and states using the infant population estimate. The vaccination coverage measures the proportion of the target population that was reached with the service. The target population denominator (children under 1 year) obtained from 2006 population census projections which is quite old, showed an inflated computed coverage when compared with recent survey data—both the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey-National Immunisation Coverage Survey 2020 and the NPHCDA Q4 2021 Programme Assessment for Performance Management and Action Lot Quality Assurance sampling surveys.31 32 Therefore, alternative target populations were estimated from recent household survey data and adjusted Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development (GRID3) population data.33 34 This alternative target population was then used to compute the vaccination coverage. Expert opinion from key informants ranked the reliability of population estimates as follows:\n\nFor Kaduna state, the available household survey data was used for the target population estimate. Kano state had no recent household survey data as such, and an equivalent was computed from the GRID3 population estimates. The socio-demographic similarities of both states allowed for the cross-use of indices. A constant of proportionality was computed for Kaduna state which had a value of 1.3995. This κ was multiplied by the Kano GRID3 population estimates to compute a household survey equivalence for Kano. An annual population growth rate of 2.9120 was applied across both states.\n\nQuantitative data analysis\n\nWe computed mean vaccination coverage prepandemic (2018 and 2019) and intrapandemic (2020 and 2021), differences in mean coverages between urban and rural areas, the proportion of vaccines administered by outreaches, coverage trends and patterns and a paired sample parametric t-test to compare mean coverages. Data had no personal identifiers and was not disaggregated by sex or religion.\n\nQualitative data analysis\n\nFor the first part of the KII questionnaires, Cronbach’s alpha was computed to assess the internal consistency and reliability of the Likert-type questions. This was analysed as ordinal data, with mean scores for each response and results displayed as tables and graphs.\n\nFor the FGD responses and the second part of the KII, data were coded and analysed using thematic content analysis using a cross-case analysis in which simultaneous analysis of data was done from the multiple channels of FGDs and key informant interviews.23 FGDs and KII data were validated for completeness and accuracy. Audio recordings of the FGD sessions were stored in a Dropbox folder and then translated and transcribed. All transcribed files with the open-ended responses from the KIIs were then uploaded to the qualitative analysis software MAXQDA Analytics Pro 2022 (Release 22.4.0) by VERBI GmbH Berlin. A read-through of the transcripts was done severally to familiarise with the contents and form initial concepts.\n\nData was coded using deductive and inductive techniques creating a coding dictionary and based on the conceptual framework of the study. Codes were grouped under two broad groups—caregivers and health system-related, and themes such as inhibitors and enablers of routine childhood vaccination, and future approaches were identified. Some of the codes had subcodes as well. For each code and subcode, a memo sticker was used to define the meaning and scope of that code. Some marker highlighter was also used to mark some prospective quotes. Results were presented as themes, tables and graphs.\n\nAll FGD and KII participants provided verbal consent which was recorded. The purpose and procedure of the study were read to all participants, including consent to participate and their rights to respond or not respond to any questions they do not feel comfortable with. The confidentiality of their responses was emphasised, and sessions were audio-recorded. An opportunity to ask questions and confirm understanding of the process was made available before verbal consent was provided. No personal identifiers were collected or used for analysis.\n\nPatient and public involvement statement\n\nThere is no participant involvement in the design and conduct of this study. Findings were disseminated to participants virtually and a copy of this publication will also be shared with the participants.\n\nResults\n\nWe present results based on both analyses of the quantitative administrative childhood vaccination data and qualitative data collected through FGDs and KIIs. Some of the analyses conducted included mean vaccination coverages, trend analysis, outreach proportions, vaccination in urban and thematic analysis.\n\nMean vaccination coverages\n\nThe overall mean vaccination coverages for BCG, Penta 1 and Penta 3 for Kaduna state declined by about 9% in contrast to Kano state where coverage for the same showed a marginal increase of about 4% over the pandemic period. MCV1 marginally declined across both states with an upward trend seen for Kano in 2021.\n\nFigure 2 shows the cumulative mean vaccination coverage trends across the two states. The mean BCG vaccination coverage for Kaduna state declined from 63.05% (SD=22.87) in 2018 to 54.38% (SD=20.96%) by 2021, a statistically significant mean difference for both the one-tailed (p=0.007) and the two-tailed (p=0.013) t-test with a medium effect size (Cohen’s d=0.56; 95% CI=0.12 to 1.00). This however increased in Kano state from 50.88% (SD=16.68) in 2018 to 54.20% (SD=20.34%) by 2021 with a marginally significant mean difference for both the one-tailed (p=0.024) and the two-tailed (p=0.048) t-test with a small effect size (Cohen’s d=−0.31; 95% CI=−0.608 to –0.003). Cohen’s d describes the standardised effect size of the mean differences and could be either small (d=0.2), medium (d=0.5) or large (d=0.8) as suggested by Cohen.35\n\nThe mean Penta 1 vaccination coverage in Kaduna state also declined from 69.88% (SD=21.02) in 2018 to 59.54% (SD=19.14%) by 2021, with a significant mean difference seen in both the one-tailed (p=0.002) and the two-tailed (p=0.004) t-test with a medium effect size (Cohen’s d=0.66; 95% CI=0.20 to 1.10). Kano state, however, saw an increase in coverage from 51.87% (SD=12.61) in 2018 up to 56.32% (SD=17.62%) by 2021 with a significant mean difference for both the one-tailed (p=0.003) and the two-tailed (p=0.006) t-test with a small effect size (Cohen’s d=−0.43; 95% CI=−0.74 to –0.12).\n\nThe mean Penta 3 coverage for Kaduna state also declined from 65.52% (SD=20.16) in 2018 to 56.06% (SD=18.07%) by 2021, which was significant in the one-tailed (p=0.002) and the two-tailed (p=0.004) t-test with a medium effect size (Cohen’s d=0.62; 95% CI=0.16 to 1.06). This contrasts with Kano state where it increased from 47.13% (SD=11.67) in 2018 to 53.83% (SD=17.26%) by 2021 with a significant mean difference in the one-tailed (p<0.001) and the two-tailed (p<0.001) t-test with a medium effect size (Cohen’s d=−0.60; 95% CI=−0.92 to –0.28).\n\nThe mean MCV1 coverage for Kaduna state marginally declined from 63.63% (SD=19.11) in 2018 to 61.35% (SD=24.32%) by 2021 but this was not statistically significant for the one-tailed (p=0.33) and two-tailed (0.67) t-test. Conversely, Kano state mean MCV1 coverage increased from 38.75% (SD=9.95) in 2018 up to 43.57% (SD=13.46) by 2021 which was statistically significant for the one-tailed (p=0.002) and two-tailed (p=0.004) t-test with a small effect size (Cohen’s d=−0.45; 95% CI=−0.76 to –0.14). Online supplemental tables 1–4 provide further details. Three of the four LGAs namely: Soba, Kaduna North and Rimin Gado showed a decline in childhood vaccination coverage during the pandemic, in contrast to Nasarawa LGA in Kano state as shown in online supplemental figure 1.\n\nSupplemental material\n\nA paired sample t-test for mean vaccination coverage differences at an alpha level of 5% was computed and indicated in table 1 by an Asterix for the two-tailed or a small cross for the one-tailed test. P values of <0.05 are considered statistically significant depicting a true difference in the mean vaccination coverages, otherwise, the mean differences are not considered significant. Using 2018 as baseline coverage showed more statistically significant differences than using 2019 as baseline coverage for the paired samples t-test.\n\nNumber of zero-dose children\n\nThe estimated number of zero-dose children in Kaduna state increased by about 33% between 2018 and 2021 whereas Kano state slightly reduced by just 1.8%. Both states combined showed an increase in the number of estimated zero-dose children between 2018 and 2021 from 783 058 to 848 340 largely influenced by the increase from Kaduna state. The combined increase in zero-dose children of 8.3% seen in both states is less than an estimated 10% population increase over the same period.\n\nVaccination outreaches and in urban areas\n\nThe proportion of childhood vaccination services delivered through outreaches declined sharply in Kaduna state from about 35% down to <25% by 2021. In contrast, the Kano state outreaches marginally increased, or a plateauing of doses administered through outreaches with Penta 3 having the highest proportion of vaccines given through outreaches (above 30%), followed by Penta 1 given through outreaches in about 25% of situations.\n\nThe proportion of vaccines administered in urban areas in Kaduna state ranged between 3.0% and 4.7% in 2018 which declined to between 2.5% and 4.5% in 2021. For Kano state, this ranged between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2018 which increased over the period of the pandemic to between 2.0% and 3.7% by 2021. While the upward trend was encouraging, it is still an under-representation of the urban population in both states.\n\nQualitative descriptive statistics\n\nThe 40 KII participants included 19 from Kaduna state and 21 from Kano state, from the government (75%), UNICEF (10%), WHO (10%) and other partners (5%). Some of the KII participants included the State Immunisation Officer, Health Facility Managers and UNICEF and WHO consultants. Thirty-three of the KII participants (82.5%) were males signifying the limited gender diversity in the health management staff cadre.\n\nThe 129 caregivers and health workers who participated in 16 FGD sessions across the two states included 65 female caregiver participants due to the predominant role played by mothers in getting children to the clinics for childhood vaccination. For the health worker FGDs, about 28% of the participants were men and 72% women signifying a female preponderance of frontline vaccinators. Tables 2–6 below show the participant characteristics for all the groups.\n\nData analysis–key informant interviews\n\nThe Likert questions revealed good internal consistency and reliability (α=0.62). Between 63.2% and 94.7% of participants for Kaduna and 59.5% and 100.0% for Kano agreed or strongly agreed with the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response on childhood vaccination coverage and equity. Between 76.2% and 84.2% of participants in the two states believed that the COVID-19 vaccines negatively affected routine childhood vaccination performance (figure 3).\n\nThematic content analysis of KII and FGD responses\n\nHere we present the analysis of coded qualitative data from both the FGDs and the open-ended responses to the KII questionnaires.\n\nInhibitors of routine childhood vaccination\n\nParticipants of both FGD and KII sessions identified multiple factors that negatively affected routine childhood vaccination performance and equity. In both states, participants reported twice as many inhibitory factors than enabling factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most referred to negative factor was ‘lockdowns stopping caregivers from coming’ which constituted 16% of all inhibitors. Other major inhibitors included ‘lack of transport’, ‘low turnout of childhood vaccination’, ‘fear due to rumors, misconceptions, and mistrust’ and ‘parents scared of getting the COVID-19 infection’ all together constituting 60% of inhibitory factors. While lockdowns and lack of transport are health system factors, caregiver factors included mistrust, ‘fear of getting COVID-19’ and caregivers just refusing to turn out with their children for unspecific reasons. Lockdowns were mentioned to be more severe in urban areas by some of the participants. Participant quotes included:\n\nParticipant 1 ‘From the lockdown period up to six months after lockdown access to routine immunization negatively dropped due to the fears’. (KII participant, Kaduna state)\n\nParticipant 2: ‘Yes, as they said it was difficult to get transportation to come to work talk less of going for outreaches. Sometimes we staff are arrested for violating lockdowns while trying to come to the clinic’. (FGD participant, Health worker, Kaduna state)\n\nParticipant 3: ‘…mostly then even when the clinics were open, caregivers were not coming because of the fear of getting COVID-19. It was said that one can even get it from a metal touched by a sick person that’s why people were scared of coming out so as not to contract the covid disease’. (FGD participant, Caregiver, Kano state)\n\nLimited or no outreaches and limited immunisation service delivery constituted about 10% of inhibitory factors mentioned suggesting that immunisation services were not adequately provided during the pandemic. Safety measures to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, human resource constraints and doubts or fears that routine childhood vaccines may have been mixed or ‘contaminated’ with COVID-19 vaccines were important factors mentioned.\n\nEnablers of routine childhood vaccination\n\nParticipants also mentioned factors that may have led to improved childhood vaccination coverage and equity during the pandemic. Key enablers mentioned by both caregivers and health workers included safety measures instituted to protect people from getting COVID-19 infection such as hand washing and facemasks. Although mentioned as inhibitors of childhood vaccination, safety measures were mentioned twice as often as positive interventions constituting about 20% of enablers. Other factors related to community engagement, religious leaders’ involvement and the use of volunteer mobilisers encouraged childhood vaccination. Participant quotes included:\n\nParticipant 4: ‘A lot of measures were taken then to prevent the spread of infection from accessing the premises of the hospital, taking transport…, measures were put in place to prevent infection and protect people, especially from overcrowding. Caregivers were allowed to continue bringing their kids for vaccination, but the organization was a bit different unlike pre-pandemic; there was spacing between persons for caregivers and health workers’. (FGD participant, caregiver, Kano state).\n\nParticipant 5: ‘Yes we have social mobilizers here and some of them were coming to raise awareness; it was with their help that we understood that the restrictions and lockdowns did not affect childhood vaccination as well as guidance on how to protect oneself and family from the covid disease, and they also provided advice to caregivers that they should take their children for vaccination’. (FGD participant, caregiver, Kano state)\n\nComparative case models for inhibitors and enablers (FGDs and KIIs)\n\nFigure 4 shows a two-case codes and themes model comparing the responses from all 129 FGD participants across the two states. Seven of the 10 topmost themes by FGD participants were inhibitory factors including lockdowns stopping vaccination, lack of transport to access the clinics or go for outreaches and low turnout for vaccination. Overall Kano emphasised inhibitors of childhood vaccination more than Kaduna. Also, 7 of the top 10 mentioned themes by KII participants were factors that inhibited childhood vaccination performance. KII participants in Kano emphasised more inhibitors of childhood vaccination than enablers. There were several divergent themes across the two states including limited outreaches (Kano) and diversion of resources (Kaduna) as inhibitors, vaccine supply availability (Kano) and caregivers bringing their kids for vaccination (Kaduna) as enablers of routine childhood vaccination performance.\n\nSuggestions for future pandemic/emergency management\n\nThe 169 participants from FGDs and KIIs made suggestions on future approaches to manage similar pandemics or emergencies (online supplemental table 1). About a quarter of all responses emphasised the need for special outreaches and mobile services to make childhood vaccination readily available during such emergencies. Together with an intensification of awareness, these two constitute close to half of all participant recommendations for ensuring the continuity of services and averting disruptions in future pandemics and emergencies. Others mentioned included palliatives and incentives for health workers and caregivers, integration of COVID-19 vaccines or similar interventions into the existing service delivery platforms and provision of transportation. One in 10 participant responses discouraged lockdowns.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis project applied a mixed-methods approach to elicit valuable insights on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response using a two-armed conceptual framework—the individual caregiver or parent with associated networks (interpersonal, community and institutional) on the demand side, and the health system with its associated components (the government, international agencies and the CSOs-civil society organisations) on the supply side.\n\nAn overall decline in vaccination coverage and equity during the pandemic was documented in three of the four LGAs across the two states. Kano state mean vaccination coverage however showed an increase over the pandemic period. Further interrogation of possible reasons for the increase in vaccination coverage during the pandemic did not yield anything unusual aside from the study participants from Kano emphasising the negative effects of the pandemic more than was done by Kaduna participants. With the ravaging diphtheria outbreak recorded in Kano as an epicentre, data quality could be a factor. Both states had about 850 000 zero-dose children combined, constituting 25% of Nigeria’s total zero-dose children for 2021 (adjusted target population).36 An increase in the number of zero-dose children should be interpreted with caution by taking cognisance of the population growth rate which might discount the increase as seen in this case. The vaccination coverage diversity seen between the states and LGAs stresses the criticality of subnational analysis in pinpointing and reaching low-performing areas with equitable services. Reduced outreaches by about 10% were one of the key factors in Kaduna contributing to the decline, more so in its urban settings, although the reverse was seen in Kano which could explain its upward trend. The abysmally small proportion of doses (between 1.5% and 4.5%) administered in urban settings across both states is worrying and needs further exploration to understand the reasons behind this, particularly with the evolving large burden of zero-dose children in urban settings,37 Wigley, Lorin.38\n\nEarlier studies suggested a marginal to moderate decline in coverage for Nigeria during the pandemic.18 20–22 37 39–42 While some suggested the disruption was short-term,22 others anticipated a longer disruption in vaccination coverage.18 One would have expected a more profound decline in coverage and worsening vaccination inequity for Northern Nigeria due to its relatively low vaccination coverage before the pandemic.\n\nQualitative data were unanimous regarding the predominant negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response to childhood vaccination. While this clearly explains the quantitative data across three of the four LGAs, and Kaduna state mean coverage, it diverges from the trend seen in the mean vaccination coverage for Kano state with no reports of any intensification activities to boost coverage. Moreover, Kano state recently has been the epicentre of a diphtheria outbreak with many children killed.43 The ongoing diphtheria outbreak with Kano being the epicentre is well explained by the qualitative data, suggesting the quantitative data needs to be interrogated further for quality issues.\n\nAbout 80% of programme managers opined that COVID-19 vaccination negatively impacted childhood vaccination which may have been due to fear that childhood vaccines were mixed with COVID-19 vaccines, ambiguous messaging, and outright refusal of COVID-19 vaccines by some parents and caregivers, but also staff shortages as was hypothesised by Okonkwo et al,44 impacted routine vaccination negatively. The verticalisation of COVID-19 vaccine operations diverted resources from the routine immunisation and PHC systems to meet the substantial COVID-19 response demand. This is getting better with the gradual integration of COVID-19 vaccines into PHC.45 Lack of transportation for health workers and caregivers and lesser outreaches were partly direct consequences of lockdowns,20 22 whose effect was felt at broader maternal and child health services.20 21 Safety measures including the use of face masks and physical distancing boosted health worker and caregiver confidence for the continuity of childhood vaccination services. The positive roles in capacity building and supplies played by international organisations and CSOs were also highlighted.\n\nReligious and community leaders play a pivotal role in routine vaccination in Northern Nigeria.6 46 47 This was highlighted as an enabling factor amid heightened mistrust. The fear of getting infected with the virus and cost of buying facemasks for 50 Nigerian naira - NGN (≈10 US cents), and the stigmatisation of caregivers practicing safety measures such as wearing facemasks were inhibitory to childhood vaccination. While these highlighted factors may be universal, they are particularly important in Northern Nigeria where the religious and community leaders are revered, and misconceptions about lifesaving interventions remain a challenge. Addressing these methodically in future pandemics is pivotal for the continuity of services.\n\nSuggestions for future pandemics\n\nSpecial mobile or outreach services were among the key recommendations for future pandemics to minimise service disruptions. Outreaches serve as an opportunity to provide an integrated package of services for the child and caregivers.48 49 While this may be resource-intensive, such integration can be cost-effective. Integrating COVID-19 vaccines or similar interventions into existing service delivery platforms will mitigate the diversion of resources away from the routine systems, further strengthening an integrated pandemic response.45\n\nLockdowns caused enormous hardships to both health workers and caregivers in accessing or providing services and were strongly discouraged. Kaduna state instituted a much longer lockdown (75 days) than Kano which may have explained the severity of the impact seen on childhood vaccination.50 Alternatives to lockdown should be considered in the future.\n\nRecruiting additional health workers or staff to meet the need surge, and providing incentives to health workers, and palliatives for the communities will cushion the hardship and enable service provision and acceptance. Finally, intensified awareness among caregivers and communities will help clear misconceptions and ensure communities have access to the right information to make informed decisions.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis study was limited to two states which may not be fully representative of the diversity in the entire nation. Sampling LGAs and health facilities was purposively done to reflect spread and diversity, but that may have introduced sampling bias. Some of the FGD participants attempted to dominate the sessions thus depriving other participants of the opportunity to share their experiences and perspectives, which was mitigated by the facilitators providing each participant the opportunity to speak out during sessions by asking each participant to share his/her comments.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study revealed how the COVID-19 pandemic and its response affected childhood vaccination performance in Northern Nigeria, with insights from both the health system and caregiver perspective aligned on the key factors, their effects and how to mitigate those in future pandemics. Several areas need further interrogation including more accurate denominator estimates for specific components like the urban population and data quality audits. In addition, the recommendations provided by participants for future pandemic preparedness and response efforts should be considered. Addressing these issues will be critical to achieving and sustaining universal childhood vaccination in Nigeria, including the most disadvantaged areas of the country, even in the face of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
