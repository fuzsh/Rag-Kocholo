        "text": "One of the key concepts at Wikipedia (and also one of the most controversial) is \"notability\". Wiki guidelines aim to discourage people using the site as a vehicle for self-promotion, and with good reason, but that can sometimes be over-zealously enforced (as with Donna Strickland, whose Wiki page was deleted as non-notable shortly before she won a Nobel...)\n\nCreating an article about your own work is very likely to be interpreted as self-promo, much more so than making improvements to a pre-existing article. At a bare minimum, you will need to provide clear evidence that the topic is important (e.g. coverage by sources not linked to yourself) and be prepared to answer the question \"if this is so important, why didn't somebody else already write about it?\"\n\nIf possible, it might be better to find a broader framing, e.g. instead of creating an article specifically about your work, create or expand on an article about the field, including reference to the work of others.\n\nDepending on the field, there may already be a group of editors who take an interest in that topic. If so, it may be productive to engage with them - \"hi, I'm RealName, interested in adding some content about blah blah blah, does this seem reasonable?\"\n\nAnyone, even someone with a conflict of interest, can write a Draft article. It will be reviewed and you need to disclose your connection.\n\nIt will initially be a stub if it isn't rejected by the editors. But it won't likely become a full article until others add to it and comment.\n\nWikipedia isn't a place for monographs and the editorial process will guard against abuse.\n\nYou can also \"propose\" an article for your topic without actually providing content. Again, the editors will make a judgement about putting up a stub.\n\nYou can also ask this question directly of the Wikipedia editorial staff through their help/contact pages.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no relationship with Wikimedia, but have made a few edits to Wikipedia articles, one of them a bit substantial. I am not an expert.\n\nIt's not frowned upon. It might not be obvious, but you are free to write whatever you want on Wikipedia as long as it's not obviously bad, and Wikipedia is not likely to object. It's only when the editor who added the material attempts to overrule other editors on what should and should not be kept that Wikipedia starts to object.\n\nIf you just write the article and leave it to its fate you're not likely to encounter any issues.\n\nThe two cons you mention don't seem like a big deal:\n\nIf there is increased visibility, more power to the person who wrote the article, and others should a well.\n\nYou might be biased and less likely to add criticism to your own work or unfavorable comparisons to other methods, but if other people think the article is biased + care about it, they will add the relevant criticism or unfavorable comparisons (or they might tag with NPOV)."
