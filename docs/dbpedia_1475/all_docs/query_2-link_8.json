        "text": "Arabic-language manuscript that lists the rulers of Kano\n\nThe Kano Chronicle (Arabic: تاريخ أرباب هذا البلاد المصممة كان; The history of the masters of this country it was designed) is an Arabic-language manuscript that lists the rulers of Kano.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kano Chronicle is a list of rulers of Kano stretching back to the 10th century AD. It tells of eleven clans of animists (such as salt extractors, brewers, or smiths) who were warned by their spiritual leader that a stranger would come and cut down their sacred tree and wrest their dominion from them: “If he comes not in your time, assuredly he will come in the time of your children, and will conquer all in this country” (Palmer 1928: III: 98). Indeed, a man named Bagauda arrived soon after, conquered, and became the first king of Kano according to the chronicle (Palmer 1928: III: 97-100).\n\nAuthorship\n\n[edit]\n\nThe existing Kano Chronicle was probably written in the 1880s by Malam Barka, a Dan Rimi (high-ranking slave official) who worked for Muhammad Bello, the Sarkin Kano (ruler of Kano) who reigned as emir from 1882–1893.[1]\n\nThe chronicle may represent the amalgamation of earlier works. The original copy is still with the descendants of Malam Idris al-Khilawiy in Kano.\n\nTranslations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe best-known translation is Sir Richmond Palmer's 1908 English translation.[2], which was derived from a manuscript obtained at Sabon Gari near Katsina, northern Nigeria.[1]\n\nThere is also a 1933 translation into Hausa by Rupert M. East, titled Labarun Hausawa da Makwabtansu: Littafi na biyu. Since this translation made use of a different source than Palmer's translation, East's text has some differences from Palmer's text.[3]\n\nRulers listed\n\n[edit]\n\nRulers of Kano listed in the Kano Chronicle and their years of reign:[4]\n\nBagauda (999-1063)\n\nWarisi (1063-1095)\n\nGijimasu (1095-1134)\n\nNawata and Gawata (1134-1136)\n\nYusa (Tsaraki) (1136-1194)\n\nNaguji (1194-1247)\n\nGugua (1247-1290)\n\nShekkarau I (1290-1307)\n\nTsamiya (1307-1343)\n\nOsumanu Zamnagawa (1343-1349)\n\nYaji I (1349-1385)\n\nBugaya (1385-1390)\n\nKanajeji (1390-1410)\n\nUmaru (1410-1421)\n\nDauda (1421-1438)\n\nAbdullahi Burja (1438-1452)\n\nDakauta (1452)\n\nAtuma (1452)\n\nYakubu (1452-1463)\n\nMuhammad Rimfa (1463-1499)\n\nAbdullahi (1499-1509)\n\nMuhammad Kisoki (1509-1565)\n\nYakufu (1565)\n\nDauda Abasama I (1565)\n\nAbubakr Kado (1565-1573)\n\nMuhammad Shashere (1573-1582)\n\nMuhammad Zaki (1582-1618)\n\nMuhammad Nazaki (1618-1623)\n\nKutumbi (1623-1648)\n\nAlhaji (1648-1649)\n\nShekkarau II (1649-1651)\n\nMuhammad Kukuna (1st reign) (1651-1652)\n\nSoyaki (1652)\n\nMuhammad Kukuna (2nd reign) (1652-1660)\n\nBawa (1660-1670)\n\nDadi (1670-1703)\n\nMuhammad Sharefa (1703-1731)\n\nKumbari (1731-1743)\n\nAlhaji Kabe (1743-1753)\n\nYaji II (1753-1768)\n\nBabba Zaki (1768-1776)\n\nDauda Abasama II (1776-1781)\n\nMuhammad Alwali (1781-1807)\n\nSulimanu (Suleiman) (1807-1819)\n\nIbrahim Dabo (1819-1846)\n\nOsumanu (Usman I) (1846-1855)\n\nAbdullahi (1855-1883)\n\nMuhammad Bello (1883-1892)\n\nRelated manuscripts\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a few 19-century Arabic-language manuscript king-lists from Kano similar to the full-length Kano Chronicle, which are:[5]\n\nMS Falke 0704 (Umar Falke Collection in the Melville J. Herskovits Library of Africana, Northwestern University; ends with the reign of Muhammad Alwali, 1781-1807)\n\nMS Jos 47 (University of Ibadan, and from the collection of Sir Richmond Palmer; ends with the reign of Ibrahim Dabo, 1819-1846)\n\nMS Jos 53 (University of Ibadan, and from the collection of Sir Richmond Palmer; ends with the reign of Usman, 1846-1855)\n\nMS Paden 399 (Paden Collection of the Melville J.
