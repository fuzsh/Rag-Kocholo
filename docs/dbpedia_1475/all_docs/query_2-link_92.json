        "text": "1905 Jiu-Jitsu book\n\nThe Complete Kano Jiu-Jitsu (Judo) (1905) is a martial arts manual that documents a system of jiu-jitsu that was taught by a Japanese Instructor at the United States Naval Academy. It was written by H. Irving Hancock as part of a series of books on Japanese martial arts, with technical expertise from Katsukuma Higashi, a practitioner of 'Kano Jiu Jitsu'.[1]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe book describes 160 combat 'tricks', including techniques designed to kill or injure. It also contains more than five hundred illustrations of ways in which a person can throw, arm lock, or strangle an opponent.[2] One chapter is dedicated to kuatsu, or methods to revive someone who has been rendered unconscious.[3] The book also contains charts of pressure points, which when struck, may debilitate an opponent.[4]\n\nCriticism\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile at the time of its first publication it was reported that the book describes the Kano system of jiu jitsu, used by the Japanese army, navy, and police,[1] or the official jiu-jitsu of the Japanese government. This is contested and the style presented is not that of Kodokan Judo.[5] Kanō Jigorō himself had no involvement with the book.[6]"
