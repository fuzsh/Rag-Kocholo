        "text": "Behind the scenes of every single Wikipedia article is a lot of work, but it can be worth the effort.\n\nHaving an article about yourself or your business has its benefits. Wikipedia pages tend to rank well in Google search results. This gives you an SEO boost, better online visibility, all which can benefit your reputation.\n\nThis article will guide you through the steps of how to create a Wikipedia page for yourself.\n\nCan You Create A Wikipedia Page For Yourself?\n\nYes, you can create a page on Wikipedia for yourself. However, you have to follow certain guidelines, especially for Wikipedia pages about people. These are referred to as Biographies of Living Persons (BLPs). To publish one, you need to:\n\nMeet Wikipedia’s notability guidelines. If you don’t meet these criteria, someone will likely remove your article.\n\nComply with Wikipedia’s conflict of interest guidelines. Wikipedia does not explicitly prohibit people from writing articles about themselves. However, in doing so, you likely will overestimate your notability or write in a biased way.\n\nComply with privacy guidelines to protect the subject’s privacy (even if the subject is yourself).\n\nUse high quality sources. Wikipedia has a higher standard for citations on BLPs. You must use previously published third party sources, not original research.\n\nAvoid defamatory or sensationalist content. You must write in a neutral, unbiased way.\n\nThe question is less can you and more should you?\n\nEditors delete 200 articles from the English Wikipedia every single day. This usually happens because the article either doesn’t meet notability guidelines or there is a conflict of interest.\n\nIf your article gets taken down, you will have a difficult time creating a new one in the future.\n\nCan You Create A Wikipedia Page For Your Company?\n\nA Wikipedia article about your company gives you tons of SEO benefits. Wikipedia pages tend to rank highly in Google search results. This gives your business more online visibility and can foster brand awareness and loyalty.\n\nSo, can you create an article on Wikipedia as a business owner or employee? Use these tips:\n\nLike any Wikipedia page, your business must still meet notability requirements. This means you must have significant coverage from third-party sources.\n\nBecause of the inherent SEO benefits, Wiki editors tend to be more skeptical towards new business pages. Naturally, if you own or work for a business, there is a conflict of interest issue. An experienced Wikipedia editor will see this and take your article down if you aren’t careful.\n\nYou must ensure to write in a neutral manner. You can not advertise on your Wikipedia page or be promotional in any way.\n\nCan Anyone Get A Wikipedia Page?\n\nAny registered Wikipedia user can create a Wikipedia page about any noteworthy topic. On the surface, this sounds like you could create a Wikipedia page about anything or anyone.\n\nHowever, it is not as simple as that; the keyword here is noteworthy. The subject of a Wikipedia article must meet the notability criteria, otherwise editors will reject the article.\n\nSo, is your subject notable enough for a Wikipedia article? Use these guidelines:\n\nYour subject must have significant coverage in the media. The coverage can’t just include mentions of the subject, it has to include a substantial amount of information.\n\nThe coverage must be significant enough that you don’t need original research. Primary sources or first-hand accounts of an event do not generally count as quality sources.\n\nYou must use third party (aka secondary) published sources. Secondary sources analyze and evaluate primary sources.\n\nSources must be reliable and verifiable by the public. These sources can be in any medium, but they must be published.\n\nSources can not come from the subject of the Wikipedia article. This means you can not use press releases, autobiographies, advertising material, or the subject’s own website.\n\nWikipedia does not give a minimum required number of sources to qualify for an article. However, the more secondary sources are available, the better your chances are of getting the article published.\n\n9 Steps To Create A Wikipedia Page\n\n1. Read Wikipedia’s guidelines\n\nBefore you start creating a Wikipedia page, remember that Wikipedia is a community effort. All editors work on a volunteer basis, and they do so because they value accessible information.\n\nWikipedia doesn’t have any hard and fast rules; instead, they have policies and guidelines. These guidelines are open to interpretation by the community of editors which you will become a part of. You must be open to working with the community to get your article published.\n\nWikipedia does outline 5 pillars to make sure everyone collaborates effectively:\n\nWikipedia is an online encyclopedia\n\nWikipedia has a neutral point of view\n\nWikipedia is free content that anyone can use edit, and distribute\n\nWikipedians should treat each other in a respectful and civil way\n\nWikipedia has no firm rules\n\nWikipedia bases every policy and guideline on these five pillars. Other editors could ban you from editing Wikipedia articles unless you follow these guidelines in good faith.\n\n2. Create your Wikipedia account\n\nBefore you start editing, you need to make an account. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the Wikipedia homepage and select your preferred language version of Wikipedia.\n\n2. On the top right corner of the page, you will see a link named “Create account.” Click on it to go to the account creation page.\n\n3. Fill out your account information, including username and password. Choose an appropriate username that doesn’t reveal too much personal information. Choose a strong and secure password.\n\n4. Providing an email address is optional, but highly recommended. This allows you to recover your account if you forget your password. You can also receive notifications about changes to pages you are interested in and communicate with other Wikipedia editors.\n\n5. Review and agree to the terms of service.\n\n6. If you provided an email address, Wikipedia will send you an email to confirm it. Follow the instructions in the email to verify your email address.\n\n3. Practicing editing other articles\n\nBefore you create a new page, you need to become an autoconfirmed user. This means your account needs to be 4 days old and you have to make 10 edits to existing pages.\n\nMaking small changes to existing Wikipedia articles lets you learn how to edit and get a feel for the style. Experienced editors tend to be skeptical of new editors who post entire new articles. You need to gain experience before you do so.\n\nUse these steps to edit an article:\n\n1. Log in to your Wikipedia account so editors can see which edits you have made. This gives you more credibility.\n\n2. Use the search bar at the top of Wikipedia to find an article you want to edit. You can edit nearly any article, but it is best to start with topics you are knowledgeable about.\n\n3. On the article page, click the “Edit source” button at the top of the article to edit the entire article. If you just want to edit a section, click the “edit source” link next to the specific section header.\n\n4. From there you will go to the editing page to make changes to the article. If you are familiar with coding, you can use the Source Editor. However, beginners unfamiliar with coding can use the VisualEditor.\n\n5. Cite your sources using the citation tools in the editor.\n\n6. Before publishing your changes, enter a brief summary in the “Edit summary” box below the edit plane. This helps other editors understand why you make your edits.\n\n7. Use the “Show preview” button to see how your changes will look after you publish them.\n\n8. When you are ready to publish your edits, click the “Publish changes button. You should be able to see your changes immediately.\n\n9. After you publish your edits, other users may review, modify, or revert them. Keep an eye on the article’s history and talk page for any feedback or discussion.\n\n4. Research your article\n\nResearch is the most important part of writing a Wikipedia article. Here are two main reasons for this:\n\nThe more references you have, the more likely it is that your subject meets the notability guidelines.\n\nYour statements need to be verifiable by anyone who reads the article. If you don’t have sources, other users will remove your article.\n\nUse sources that are:\n\nReputable, such as books, academic journals, newspapers, and official websites. Avoid blogs or social media posts.\n\nSecondary, meaning they analyze and interpret primary data.\n\nRecent, so your information is up-to-date.\n\nComprehensive, providing in-depth coverage of the topic, rather than mere mentions.\n\nIndependent of the subject.\n\nAlways use multiple sources to ensure a balanced perspective. Wikipedia articles should summarize what reliable sources say about a topic. They should not analyze, interpret, or introduce original ideas.\n\n5. Write your article in the sandbox\n\nDon’t publish your article immediately; use the sandbox instead. This offers a private space for you to draft, edit, and refine your article before publishing it. Follow these steps:\n\nTo access your sandbox, go to your user page. Type ‘/sandbox‘ at the end of the URL of your page. It should look this this ‘https://wikipedia.org/wiki/User:YourUsername/sandbox‘\n\nBegin by writing the title of your article at the top of the sandbox page. Use the Wikipedia Article Wizard if you are new to this process. It gives you guidance and tips for creating your article to Wikipedia standards.\n\nWrite in a neutral, unbiased way – as if you are writing an encyclopedia. Present the pure facts without taking a particular viewpoint. Avoid promotional language, especially if you’re writing about yourself or your business.\n\nStructure your article with headings and subheadings to make it easy to follow. Use the Wikipedia Manual of Style for formatting tips.\n\nSupport your statements with citations from reliable, third-party sources. Use the citation toolbar in the editor to format references correctly.\n\n6. Submit your draft\n\nOnce your article is ready, and you believe it meets all Wikipedia guidelines, you can move it from your sandbox to the main namespace.\n\nTo do this, click the “Move” tab at the top of the page or through the Articles for Creation (AfC) process. Submit the page for review, and experienced editors will review your draft before it goes live.\n\n7. Make suggested changes\n\nOnce you click “Submit”, your article joins a queue of drafts waiting for review. Wait times vary from a few days to several weeks or more, depending on the backlog.\n\nAn editor will then review your article against Wikipedia’s content guidelines. After review, they will come to one of three outcomes:\n\nAcceptance: If your article meets the requirements, it will go live.\n\nRevisions Requested: Often, the review will request changes to improve the article. They will offer guidance on how to edit your draft to meet the standards.\n\nDecline: If your article does not meet notability guidelines or has significant issues, the reviewer can reject it. They will provide reasons for their decision, and you will have the opportunity to address these issues and resubmit.\n\n8. Make updates as needed\n\nCongrats, your article is now live and hopefully ranking well in Google search results. However, you still have more work to do.\n\nWikipedia articles are living documents. Other editors can make edits and add new information at any time. They can even nominate the article for deletion if they believe it no longer meet’s Wikipedia’s standards. Keep your page updated with relevant information.\n\n9. If nothing else works, be notable\n\nYou can follow all the steps listed above. But we’re going to tell you something no one else will:\n\nPublishing a Wikipedia page about yourself or your business is difficult.\n\nThere is always the chance that another editor will reject or take down your article. This could be because of a conflict of interest issue or you don’t meet the notability guidelines.\n\nSometimes, the best thing you can do is to not create a Wikipedia page at all. Instead, aim to be noteworthy enough that an independent editor creates a Wikipedia page about you without your intervention.\n\nConclusion: Wikipedia Page Creation\n\nCreating a Wikipedia page involves a lot of work. Most of the work you will do happens before you ever create an account. The most important step is making sure you are notable enough to have an article written about you.\n\nOnce you have a Wikipedia page, you will be much more visible in Google search results. This can have positive effects on your online reputation."
