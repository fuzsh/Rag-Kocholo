In the lead section, you should also make the notability of your article clear and emphasise why it should be included on Wikipedia.\n\nThe tone is also very important when making your own Wikipedia article. When writing, your language should be neutral and accessible. For example, if you mention any terms which someone new to the subject may not understand you should see if there is a link to another Wikipedia page which explains the term. Only ever link a term the first time you use it. You should also avoid language that reflects your opinion or is not neutral.\n\nMake sure as well to link other Wikipedia pages to your new article. For example, if you are writing up an article about a book by a famous author, link to your new article from their page. Use the Find Link tool to identify pages that should link back to your new page.\n\nYou should have a look at Featured Articles to see Wikipediaâ€™s best quality articles and you should consult Wikipedia's Manual of Style to understand what Wikipedia is expecting in terms of style and structure to keep articles consistent.\n\nHow to make your own article\n\nWhen making your own article you should aim for at least 100 words with three citations. You should draft your article in your sandbox.\n\nTip: use an exemplar page as your guideline. There are many excellent articles. See Featured Articles.\n\nBuilding a biography page (pdf).\n\nDrafting your article in the Sandbox\n\nYou should draft your article in the Sandbox which you can think of as your personal draft space. You can create articles here without fear of them being interfered with by other editors.\n\nLog in to your Wikipedia account.\n\nSelect the red 'Sandbox' link at the top of the screen.\n\nSelect 'Create' at the top of the page to use the Visual editor.\n\nPut your cursor on 'Insert paragraph' and type in a sentence. You need at least one character of text to save your sandbox.\n\nSelect 'Publish changes' and type a brief edit summary. NB this does not publish your draft to Wikipedia's live space, it saves any work you have done which you can then go back and edit.\n\nVideo: How to make your own article.\n\nWhen making your own article you should aim for at least 100 words with three citations.
