        "text": "Pattern of self medication in Kano metropolis\n\nThree hundred (78.9%) out of the 380 subjects studied admitted using drug (s) in the past without the prescription of a physician. About a quarter (26.3%) reported using the drugs on their wards. The observed pattern of self medication among our respondents is as depicted in . More than half (54.8%) had used drugs occassionally, while 12.1% had been very frequent with them. The respondents reported consumption of one or more drugs without obtaining a prescription. The drugs commonly consumed were antimalarials (42.1%), analgesics (40.6%), and antibiotics (29.4%). Cough mixtures/antitussives were also used by 13.3% of the respondents. Similarly, 5.9% of drugs like vitamins, lexatives and oral contraceptive pills were consumed without the prescription of a doctor or other relevant health workers. Majority of these respondents obtained the drug (s) from either the patent medicine stores (62.5%) in town, or from drug stores in the market (19.8%). The other sources from where respondents obtained their drug (s) include drug hawkers (Kafada chemists) and family/friends as shown in . The drug vendors (41.5%) and family/friends (26.6%) provided the respondents with instructions on how to use the drugs consume. In 25.1% of cases however, respondents needed no external instruction on the use of the drugs commonly consumed.\n\nWhen asked why doctor (s) were not consulted for prescription before respondents consumed the drug (s), the majority proclaimed that long queues in the hospitals (38.4%), and doctors not being readily available (25.1%) were the most common reasons for their self medication. Other reasons mentioned were “services too expensive” (17.7%) and “found it unnecessary” (18.9%).\n\nWhen we examined the effect of some selected socio-demographic variables (Gender, age, marital status, educational status and occupation) on self medication, it was observed that respondents’ educational status (χ2 = 7.81, P < 0.05), occupation (χ2 = 6.88, P < 0.05) and age (χ2 = 9.66, P < 0.05) were significantly associated with consumption of analgesic drugs. Respondents with at least secondary school education were less likely to have consumed analgesics without prescription [(OR = 0.51 (0.31; 0.84)]. Similarly, the non manual workers from among the respondents [OR = 0.54 (0.33; 0.88)], and those that were 44 years or less [OR = 0.44 (0.25; 0.77)] were also less likely to have consumed analgesics without prescription. Also, it was observed that marital status was the only factor that was statistically associated with consumption of antibiotics [(χ2 = 4.35, P < 0.05; O.R = 0.59 (0.34; 1.00)]; and with use of vitamins, laxatives and oral contraceptive drugs without prescription [(χ2 = 7.15, P < 0.05; O.R = 0.17 (0.03; 0.77)]. On the other hand, the inappropriate use of cough syrup was significantly associated with the respondents’ educational status (χ2 = 4.01, P < 0.05) and age (χ2 = 3.79, P < 0.05). Respondents that had attained at least secondary school level of education were less likely to have used cough syrups without the prescription of a doctor or relevant health worker [OR = 0.52 (0.26; 1.04)]. In the same vein, the younger respondents who were 44 years of age or less were less likely to have used cough syrups without prescription [OR = 0.51 (0.24; 1.07)] as shown . However, none of the socio-demographic factors examined was significantly associated with the use of antimalarial drugs [Age (χ2 = 0.42, P = 0.52); Gender (χ2 = 1.17, P = 0.28); Marital status (χ2 = 0.02, P = 0.89); Educational status (χ2 = 0.50, P = 0.48); and occupation (χ2 = 0.16, P = 0.69)].\n\nThe associated factors were further subjected to binary logistic regression using models consisting of only the significant variables for each of the drug use category. The findings reveal that respondents’ age and occupation were the only factors that were significantly associated with the inappropriate use of analgesic drugs. On the other hand, neither age nor the educational status of the subjects turned out to be risk factors for irrational use of antitussives/cough syrups [ ].\n\nPattern of self-medication\n\nThe practice of self-medication has long been in existence world wide, and the situation continues to increase particularly in developing countries where high prevalence had been reported.(12,13) The high prevalence observed in this study (85.0%) is within the 73.0 and 100.0% prevalence respectively reported by Akanbi and colleagues;(8) and Ifedili and Ifedili(14) from the southern part of Nigeria. Similar prevalence was observed in several other African countries.(13,15–17) Interestingly, the prevalence of self medication reported from Ethiopia,(18) Ghana(19) and South Africa(20) were much lower and very similar to those observed in studies conducted in Asia,(21),(22) parts of Europe,(3,4,23) and the United States of America.(24) The lower prevalence reported from these countries may not be unconnected with their improved access to health facilities, health personnel; and high regard for health and safety. This may perhaps serve as an explanation why majority of our respondents proclaimed that long queues in the hospitals and doctors not being readily available were their main reasons for their self medication. The above finding is corroborated by results from Bamgboye and his colleagues where inaccessibility to health facility was reported among the leading promoters of self-medication.(12)\n\nMedicines commonly misused vary from one community to another. We observed that antimalarials, analgesics and antibiotics in that order were inappropriately consumed by our respondents without the prescription of a physician. Previous studies from Nigeria,(8) Mozambique,(16) Sudan,(17) South Africa,(20) Tanzania,(15) Ghana,(19) and Turkey(23) reported that one or more of these drugs topped the list of drugs commonly consumed by their respondents without physician’s prescription. Contrarily, antibiotics were drugs least misused by the public in Niger Republic.(13)\n\nHome management of malaria and other common childhood illnesses are being advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF as a strategy to promote early and effective treatment for malaria and other common ailments like diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections (ARIs); sexually transmitted infections (STIs); and to promote child survival in order to reduce morbidity and mortality from these diseases particularly in developing countries.(25,26) Although intensive trainings are advanced to the caregivers in the community, and adhoc or voluntary health workers as channels through which these interventions are delivered, access to drugs coupled with the public’s disregard for drug regulations and safety could explain the rampant misuse of drugs in our societies. This is supported by Worku’s observation from a study on safe medication in Ethiopia that 52.4% of his respondents obtained their drugs from informal retail outlets.(18) Okumuraj and other researchers also reported that self medication is commoner among those who have accessibility to drugs, so also when drugs are kept at home.(4) Furthermore, Ouedrawgo and colleagues reported that familiarity of the general public with some disease conditions like malarial symptoms contributed immensely to depressing their will to consult a doctor.(27)\n\nIt is well acknowledged that misuse of antibiotics and antimalarials contribute to the widespread antibiotic and the recent chloroquine resistance. Also, unnecessary exposure to cough syrups and other sedatives also lead to addiction. Incidentally, we observed that inappropriate use of cough syrups/antitussives is significantly prevalent among our respondents. This was similarly reported from Turkey,(23) Tanzania(15) and Mozambique.(16) This is a clear indication for more regulatory framework in this regard.\n\nInterestingly, safe care initiatives if correctly implemented can contribute immensely to the rational use of medicines. Promotion of self-care is an educational and empowering process that ensures that people with the right information can make the right decision as far as their own health is concerned.(28) This however needs policy direction and professional support. There is currently no policy on self care in Nigeria, but there are health care initiatives that promote self care in the community such as the community component of integrated management childhood illnesses C-IMCI, Roll-back malaria programme etc., that are already operational in Nigeria. If properly implemented, self care will reduce the problems of irrational use of drugs and its burden on the health service in Kano and Nigeria at large.\n\nThe pattern of self medications varies from one community to another, and with individual characteristics. This study similarly observed this differentials with the type of drugs commonly consumed. We found that self medication with analgesics was more common among respondents involved in manual works and in people that were 44 years or more. Furthermore, being single was significantly associated with inappropriate consumption of antibiotics; oral contraceptives and other drugs. Other workers similarly reported that self medication is more common among women than men, and among people who live alone;(3) and that it is commoner among the lower socio-economic class.(21) On the contrary however, other reports showed that self medication is more common among people with higher education,(3,21) and among younger than older individuals.(7) It is worthy of note at this juncture that the agreements and disagreements in the findings of our study with the others may perhaps be due to lack of disaggregation of the individual characteristics studied by the other researchers by the type of drugs consumed as clearly disaggregated in our study.\n\nAwareness and perceptions of hazards of self medication\n\nThe health hazards associated with self-medication are enormous, as they affect the overall health of individuals and community.(15) The situation is more disturbing as the concept of self-medication seems unclear to many people to the extent that some do not even regard their practices as form of self-medication. People often go to medical shops and ask for tablets for stomachache, headache, fever, cough or diarrhea. The pharmacies gives some tablets without asking any question; and people buy over-the-counter drugs even for children.(16) Self medication is associated with risks such as misdiagnosis, use of excessive drug dosage, prolonged duration of use, drug interactions and polypharmacy. The latter may be particularly problematic in the elderly.\n\nThis study observed that about half of the respondents were aware of at least one hazard of self medication. Paradoxically, about two-thirds of all the respondents correctly perceived that self medication could be hazardous. Awareness levels of 47.9 and 45.2% for self medication were reported from studies conducted in United States of America(24) and Nepal(22) respectively. On the other hand, lower figures ranging from 22.8 to 37.9% were reported from studies conducted in Ethiopia,(18) India,(21) Turkey(23) and the southern part of Nigeria.(14)\n\nThe problems of self medication are enormous in Kano metropolis and require urgent interventions. In view of our findings therefore we recommend that the National Agency for Foods and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria should work together to ensure that all drug retail outlets and drug sellers are registered, controlled drugs are dispensed only on prescription of the physicians; and the laws safeguarding drug use are duly enforced. Drugs control must be implemented rationally, restricting the availability of drugs to the public. The Ministries of Health (MOH) and development partners should strengthen efforts towards educating the entire public on the dangers of indiscriminate and in-appropriate drug use, and also to improve access of the general public to qualitative and affordable medical care in the hospitals, thus safeguarding them from the dangers of safe medication. Safe care initiatives on safe medication should also be introduced."
