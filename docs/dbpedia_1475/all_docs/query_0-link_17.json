        "text": "Kano\n\nstate, Nigeria\n\nRecent News\n\nKano, state, northern Nigeria. It was formed in 1968 from Kano province, and in 1991 its northeastern portion was split off to form Jigawa state. It is bordered by the states of Jigawa to the north and east, Bauchi to the southeast, Kaduna to the southwest, and Katsina to the northwest. Kano consists of wooded savanna in the south and scrub vegetation in the north and is drained by the Kano-Chalawa-Hadejia river system. The state’s light sandy soils are excellent for growing peanuts (groundnuts), a major export. Other crops include cotton, onions, indigo, tobacco, wheat, and gum arabic; millet, sorghum, beans, cowpeas, and corn (maize) are subsistence crops. Cattle, horses, goats, and sheep are grazed, and hides and skins are exported. Tin and columbite are mined.\n\nKano city, the state capital, is a manufacturing centre producing processed foods, textiles, furniture, cement, rolled steel, and light trucks. Most of the state’s inhabitants are Hausa or Fulani, but there are also Nigerians from other parts of the country, Arab traders, and Europeans. Kano city, Rano, and Wudil are its chief market centres. The state is crossed by the main (Lagos-Nguru) railway and by highways that link it to Kaduna and Bauchi states. Kano city has an international airport. Pop. (2006) 9,383,682.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Amy McKenna."
