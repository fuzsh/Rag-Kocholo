        "text": "No,\n\nbecause even though Wikipedia is one of the Webs most popular reference sites,\n\nit isnt a credible resource because anyone is allowed to be a contributor to\n\nthe website.\n\nWikipedia Academic has posted an article explaining why\n\nit is a bad idea (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Academic_use)\n\nBelow is the article:\n\nCaution: It is often\n\na bad idea to cite an encyclopedia in academic research papers.\n\nWikipedia is increasingly used by people in the academic\n\ncommunity, from first-year students to professors, as the easiest source of\n\ninformation about anything and everything. However, citation of Wikipedia in\n\nresearch papers may not be considered acceptable, because Wikipedia is not a\n\ncreditable source.\n\nThis can be avoided by following two simple rules:\n\nDo your research assignment properly. Remember that any\n\nencyclopedia is a starting point for research, not an ending point.\n\nAn encyclopedia is great for getting a general understanding of a\n\nsubject before you dive into it. But then you do have to dive into your subject,\n\nusing books and articles and other appropriate sources. What you find in your\n\nother sources will be more detailed, more precise, and more carefully reasoned\n\nthan the summary you found in an encyclopedia. The sources you cite in your\n\npaper will be the more detailed sources you have used. All you need to do with\n\nWikipedia, then, is thank it in your heart.\n\nAn encyclopedia is great for checking little details.\n\nLittle details may be:\n\nGeneral knowledge that you have forgotten, like the starting date\n\nof the\n\nFirst World War or the boiling point of\n\nmercury. In that case, you should recognize the information once you find\n\nit, and know it’s right. Citation is not needed for things that are general\n\nknowledge.\n\nA somewhat obscure point, like the population of\n\nGhana. If this matters for your assignment, you should verify the\n\ninformation using a tried and tested source, such as the\n\nCIA World Factbook.\n\nA very obscure point, such as the names of the founders of the\n\nSocial Democrat Hunchakian Party. This may be almost impossible to find\n\nanywhere other than Wikipedia, unless you read\n\nArmenian, which you probably don’t, or are prepared to spend an hour in the\n\nlibrary, which you probably don’t want to. In this case, you should rely on–and\n\ncite–Wikipedia.\n\nUse your judgment. Remember that all sources have to be\n\nevaluated.\n\nIf your professor has assigned you an article or a chapter, that\n\nmeans your professor thinks it is basically OK. Do you trust your professor?\n\nThat’s usually enough.\n\nIf a book is in your university library or published by a\n\nreputable\n\nuniversity press, or if an article is in a standard\n\nacademic journal, that means that several professors at some point thought\n\nit was basically OK. But time may have passed, and the book or article may now\n\nbe out of date.\n\nIf your source is a website, it may be great or it may be awful.\n\nA Wikipedia article may be as good as (or better than!) an article\n\nassigned to you by your professor, or it may contain inaccurate information and\n\neccentric judgments. It is unlikely to be as bad as the worst sort of website.\n\nYou have to judge.\n\nIncreasingly Wikipedia information will be referenced\n\nwith academic references. Hopefully when you see a fact in Wikipedia you will\n\nbe able to quickly verify it with an online, academic source, which you can cite\n\ninstead of Wikipedia."
