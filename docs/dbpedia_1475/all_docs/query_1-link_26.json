        "text": "As he returned to the throne in a colourful ceremony, Nigeria's influential Emir of Kano addressed the people who deposed him four years ago.\n\nThose who expelled Muhammadu Sanusi II from his role as a traditional Muslim leader in the northern state of Kano were not worth talking about, he said on Friday.\n\nMr Sanusi was ousted in 2020 for showing \"insubordination'' to the authorities there.\n\nHis supporters believe he was sacked as he opposed the re-election of Kano's then governor.\n\nMr Sanusi, an ex-central bank chief, was reappointed by current Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf at Kano State Government house on Friday.\n\nDuring his 2023 campaign to become governor, Mr Yusuf had pledged to bring Mr Sanusi back as emir.\n\nHe said that by dethroning Mr Sanusi, the authorities had violated Kano's centuries-old tradition of emir rule.\n\nTraditional leaders in Nigeria hold few constitutional powers but are able to exert significant influence as they are seen as custodians of both religion and tradition.\n\nAt Friday's ceremony, Mr Sanusi expressed his gratitude to the state governor, state legislators and the people of Kano as a whole.\n\nOf those that deposed him in 2020, Mr Sanusi said: \"Those who did that are not worthy of me talking about what they did.\"\n\nBut just hours before the event, it was unclear whether Mr Sanusi's reinstatement ceremony would actually go ahead.\n\nThe Federal High Court had issued a last-minute order stopping the state government from abolishing all five emirates created during the administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and returning to the system where only one emir ruled Kano.\n\nThe ruling was a response to an application from Aminu Babba Dan Agundu, a Kano emirate official who opposed moving back to the old system.\n\nHowever, Mr Yusuf said he did not recognise the ruling.\n\nReferencing reports that the High Court judge was based in the US, Mr Yusuf said at the ceremony: \"Imagine a judge in America ordering us to halt the coronation of the Emir of Kano, Sanusi. Our laws are in place and they will not change.\"\n\nMr Sanusi became the 14th Emir of Kano in 2014 after the death of Ado Bayero.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, he had frosty relations with then-Governor Ganduje.\n\nHe was sacked in 2020, with the government accusing him of \"total disrespect\" towards the local institutions.\n\nThe government then created five new emirates in the state and appointed Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero as the new emir in Kano.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before Mr Sanusi returned to the throne, the Kano State House of Assembly abolished the five former emirates.\n\nThat same day, Governor Yusuf signed the law and gave the emirs of the abolished emirates 48 hours to vacate their palaces.\n\nOn the streets of Kano, the reaction was mixed.\n\nResident Idris SR Dawanau told the BBC on Friday: \"I am extremely happy about the reinstatement of [Sanusi] today.\n\n\"I wish him well and hope he continues to contribute positively as he always has.\"\n\nBut fellow resident Lawal Najeef criticised the move: \"In my opinion, leaving all the emirs in place without removing any would have been better because it makes things easier.\n\n\"For example, if you have an emir nearby, people can go to him with their issues without having to travel far.\""
