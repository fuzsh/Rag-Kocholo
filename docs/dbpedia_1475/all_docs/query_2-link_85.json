(1959)[2] Hygiene Motivator Kano (1984)[3] Must-be Attractive One-dimensional Indifferent Cadotte and Turgeon (1988)[4] Dissatisfier Satisfier Critical Neutral Brandt (1988)[5] Minimum requirement Value enhancing Hybrid Unimportant as determinant Venkitaraman and Jaworski (1993)[6] Flat Value-added Key Low Brandt and Scharioth (1998)[7] Basic Attractive One-dimensional Low impact Llosa (1997[8], 1999[9]) Basic Plus Key Secondary\n\nThe Kano model offers some insight into the product attributes which are perceived to be important to customers. The purpose of the tool is to support product specification and discussion through better development team understanding. Kano's model focuses on differentiating product features, as opposed to focusing initially on customer needs. Kano also produced a methodology for mapping consumer responses to questionnaires onto his model.\n\nQuality Function Deployment (QFD) makes use of the Kano model in terms of the structuring of the Comprehensive QFD matrices. Mixing Kano types in QFD matrices can lead to distortions in the customer weighting of product characteristics. For instance, mixing Must-Be product characteristics --such as cost, reliability, workmanship, safety, and technologies used in the product--in the initial House of Quality will usually result in completely filled rows and columns with high correlation values. Other Comprehensive QFD techniques using additional matrices are used to avoid such issues. Kano's model provides the insights into the dynamics of customer preferences to understand these methodology dynamics.\n\n[edit] See also\n\nproduct management\n\nproduct portfolio\n\nNew Product Development\n\nQuality Function Deployment\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ Bartikowski, B., Llosa, S.
