        "text": "Pseudonym of a Spanish comic book artist (born 1973)\n\nFor the 2000 AD character, see Bad Company (comics).\n\nKano is the pseudonym of Spanish comic book artist Jose Ángel Cano López.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nKano began his career at the age of 13, editing Spanish-language comics fanzines; at 15 he was already doing layouts and design work for Planeta-DeAgostini (later doing covers and illustrations for the Spanish editions of Marvel comics).[1] Kano is a founding member of the Spanish magazine about comics Krazy Comics as well as the Phoenix Studio, which provided design, illustration and publishing services and was eventually merged with Camaleón Ediciones, a publishing house that Kano worked for in his early days.\n\nBefore settling as a professional cartoonist, Kano has done extensive work in the fields of illustration and animation, providing storyboards for D'Ocon Films and LolaFilms and design work for Telefónica-Movistar, Mitsubishi and various advertising agencies.[1]\n\nIn 1998, encouraged by his wife Elsken, Kano decided to enter US comics industry and debuted with the Virtex mini-series, published by Oktomica Comics. He then went to work for the mainstream market, where he succeeded Germán García on Action Comics at DC Comics.[2] Since then, Kano worked mostly for Marvel and DC, and, since 2014, for the revived Valiant Entertainment.[3]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nCovers only\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nKano at the Grand Comics Database\n\nKano at Lambiek's Comiclopedia"
