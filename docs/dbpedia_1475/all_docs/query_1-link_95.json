        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe customer demand importance degrees are an important link for express companies to implement product optimization design, service quality improvement, and effective resource allocation management decisions. This paper proposes a method of customer demand classification and its importance determination for express service enterprise. First at all, Kano model and K-means clustering were used to objectively classify the customer demands. Secondly, considering the influence of customer satisfaction on the determination of demand importance degrees, classification fitting function was established to correct the initial importance degrees for different customer demand. Finally, Z express company is selected as an empirical study, which proves the rationality and operability of the proposed method in this paper. This method can be further applied to other service-oriented customer demand analysis and has a broad application prospect.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nQing-liang Meng,Lin He, Research on Dynamic Prediction foe Kano Model's Quality Elements Classification Based on GM(1,1) Model[J].Chinese Journal of Management Science, 2015,23(9):139-145.\n\n[2]\n\nBerger C.Kano's methods for understanding customer-defined quality[J].
