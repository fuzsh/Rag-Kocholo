        "text": "– Dr. Jekwu Ozoemene\n\n“Late in 1947, my train was gasping and panting up the steep incline that leads on the Bauchi Plateau in Northern Nigeria. It was a chilly morning; I had been traveling third class for two days and two sleepless nights with scarcely any room in which to stretch my legs”\n\nThis is the opening line of Cyprian Ekwensi’s “The Passport of Mallam Ilia”, a fascinating tale of adventure, love, valour, consuming and destructive quest for vengeance, loosely wrapped in the culture and history of pre-independence Northern Nigeria. While the setting is mainly pre-independence Northern Nigeria, a lot of the book’s major events take place specifically in Kano and Mecca between 1902 and 1947.\n\nThe book itself is a mere 80 pages, 70 pages of which consist the story’s text. Like most novellas, the story is quick paced, chronological in its narration and focuses on and explores a single central conflict. Unlike a novel, it is not intended to spend time exploring subplots, so readers should not be disappointed when they don’t find any. As one is won’t to find in novellas, most of the character development is focused on the protagonist Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia. Even the characters of the frame-narrator Hassan, and the antagonist Usuman, are not properly developed, Hassan much less than Usuman.\n\nThe Passport of Mallam Ilia is made up of a Prologue, three chapters and an Epilogue.\n\nChapters 1 and 2 are introduced to the reader with an explanatory caption and further sub-divided by episodic diaphragms; “Shanchi”, “Death by The Sword”, and “Usuman Terror of the North” for Chapter 1, and “The Indian Woman”, “The School at Mecca”, “The Cameroons Campaign, 1916” for Chapter 2.\n\nThe Prologue, Chapter 3 and the Epilogue have no episodic diaphragms and can be said to be standalone episodes.\n\nOur review of this book will be in three parts; first will essentially be the introduction, which is what we have just done, then a book tour synopsis, weaving through the highlights of the story and its thematic preoccupation, and then we will wrap up with a light critique of the work itself; the author, his style and influences.\n\nPart 1 – Book Tour.\n\nPrologue\n\n“What struck me particularly was the man’s uncleanliness. He was very dirty, his hands were cracked by the Harmattan, that cold dry wind that corrodes everything lying between the Sahara and the Gulf of Guinea; his clothes were grey with dirt; his face looked unwashed. And that book he had gloated over was a passport.\n\nI wondered by what freak of circumstances such an insignificant-looking man could have come by an authority requesting all concerned ‘in the name of his Britannic Majesty’ to allow my companion to ‘pass freely and without hindrance and to afford him every assistance of which he may stand need’…In my boyish imagination, a man who owned such a valuable document could not look like this”.\n\nOne of the things I find interesting here is the author’s juxtaposition of the imagery of a clean and valuable passport issued “in the name of his Britannic Majesty” with the dirt and grime as presented in the person of Mallam Ilia. It is reminiscent of Ayi Kwei Armah’s use of dirt, grime and putrefaction imagery in her “The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” to denote the corruption overlay on everything in post-independence Ghana. Ekwensi seems to be asking us not to be hasty in our judgement, for beneath this rash adventurer, purveyor of death and all sorts of other atrocities (as we will learn about Mallam Ilia), lies a useful, valuable, good man at heart and of almost royal heritage.\n\nWas he travelling to Jos?\n\nBecause Kofi Usuman, an old acquaintance who ran into the frame-narrator on the train had intruded on his thoughts and asked if he was “going to the land of the tin mines”. It was through this brief exchange that we learn the frame-narrator’s name – Hassan. To be clear, while Hassan may be the book’s frame-narrator, especially for both the Prologue and the Epilogue, we hear the story from the point of view of Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia, the book’s protagonist.\n\n“He looked out of the window, as if the interview gave him some pain, and for a moment I studied him silently.\n\nHe was indeed travel-worn: his clothes were in tatters, and it must have been some weeks since his beard had seen a razor. Even the cap beneath his turban was visibly frayed”.\n\nWe are to learn that Mallam Ilia was mortally wounded. “He looked over his shoulder, like a thief entering a strong room, and his voice sank low. ‘Look at this’, he said and lifted up his dirty robe.\n\nI nearly screamed at what I saw. Beneath his robe, just under the heart, was a long, deep flesh wound. It had stopped bleeding and the cloth had stuck to its corners’. The old man quickly covered up the wound and smiled thinly at me”.\n\nMallam Ilia had made his peace with his maker for he continued “I cannot talk too much you see’ he panted. ‘It will soon be over. I have taken some of this’—he showed me a white powder—‘just to make quite sure. I don’t know what the English call it, but when I was in charge of the army supplies, they told me that –that as much as will lie on a sixpence will kill a man in about 18 hours”.\n\nInitially, when Hassan asked him “why all this?” Mallam Ilia shrugged his shoulders and retorted “Nothing, I just want to die”.\n\nAt this point, we learn of the Mallam’s full name when Hassan takes a look at his passport “Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia, a man five feet six inches tall, with no tribal marks on his face, a man born in 1882 and traveling to Mandara, Marua, and Fort Lamy for the purposes of trade”.\n\nSomething else we will find running through this book is the prevalence of chance encounters between the characters and many coincidences that may make the narrative appear too contrived.\n\nMallam Ilia tells Hassan, “I wish I could tell you my story…I feel you would understand”…. to a stranger he met fortuitously on the train and for two days had travelled with in silence.\n\n“It will, I must! I must! He pleaded”.\n\nIt is events such as this that led some critics to point at Cyprian Ekwensi’s use of contrived plot devices to move the story along to climax and denouement. To argue this is to disassemble Ekwensi’s signature artistic African campfire or moonlight tale narrative style, a blend of traditional themes with undisguised romanticism, a lot of magical realism. This style often deploys what will be considered in English literature as deus ex machinas to move the stories along.\n\nMallam Ilia continues “I really wanted this story told. Told without errors”.\n\nDespite his obvious physical and mental pain in telling this story, literally with his last breath “About twenty miles from Jos, he closed his eyes and invited me to go over the notes I had made on odd bits of paper so that he might be sure I had missed nothing”\n\nIf we are to believe Hassan, those notes are what gave birth to the underlying story in itself and introduces us to the first chapter.\n\nChapter 1 – “Kanemi’s Daughter”\n\nShanchi (Episodic diaphragm 1 of Chapter 1).\n\nThis chapter opens with one of the book’s most iconic phrases. “My name is Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia. I was born sixty-five years ago, at a time when man was man, and women were won by those who deserved them”.\n\nWe also get to know about Mallam’s background. As a youth, his life was wild, and there was nothing he loved better than a good fight, or a hard race on horse-back. His parents were wealthy and saw to it that he got everything he wanted without question; slaves, gold, horses, merchandise in plenty and the best company in Kano.\n\nWe also find out that he was quite the romantic type, and this is from his desire not to have a wife “thrust on” or “bought” for him (something quite normal at the time), but to search for love and his heart’s desire.\n\nIn this chapter, we also learn that at the time of these events, Kano had yet to be conquered by the British and prospects of the future colonial rulers attacking Kano was being openly discussed by the people. This also suggests that Kano may have rebuffed advances or fallen out with the British.\n\nWe learn more about the young Mallam in his first encounter with Zarah’s father, how he was goaded into drawing his sword at the insinuation that he could be a “coward”, only to be easily disarmed and to find out that the man on horseback, who so easily disarmed him with a flick of his whip and who he was about to challenge, is the influential Kanemi, Prince of the Tuaregs.\n\nMallam Ilia’s rashness, rascality and romantic inclinations was also made evident in his enthusiasm to head off the next day to the advertised venue of the contest, Unguan Kanawa, to win Zarah’s hand, despite not knowing what he was required to do to win her.\n\nAt the venue of the event, Kanemi, Prince of the Tuaregs summarised the sentiments behind the endeavour in his opening speech;\n\n“Welcome, my sons….Tonight, one of you is going to win the hand of my daughter Zarah. But he must be the bravest of you all. We live in times when a man’s might is his right”.\n\nHe then went on to tell them that he presumes that they had all heard of the game called Shanchi and challenged that any of them who thought that Zarah was not a sufficient prize to induce him to take part should leave immediately. When none of them budged, he reminded them quite morbidly that “Some of you here may not breathe tomorrow’s air. For this night Shanchi may claim you”.\n\nFor those of us who haven’t read the book or do not know about Shanchi. As explained by Kanemi, in a Shanchi contest, contestants will be led to an open field “in the middle of which is a ring, this is where the game will be played. You all go in there. The lights will be put out. In the darkness, you will try to get your man. Do what you can to disable him. At the end of the game, the man who is left becomes Zarah’s husband”.\n\nWhen one of the contestants asked how their opponents were to be disabled, Kanemi responded “You have swords, haven’t you?” When the man followed up with, “I was thinking—if the man died… to which Kanemi responds “if he dies, we remove him”.\n\nLater on in the chapter, Ilia would note that “In a way, I am glad the British came to Kano so soon after and stamped out such a dreadful custom”. Here, I suspect that we hear Ekwensi’s authorial voice speaking through Mallam Ilia and reflecting his rejection of such a barbaric tradition.\n\nTo accompany their deadly Shanchi joist, Zarah brought out her Gwoje and “played so sweetly and so softly that the night stood still and listened to her”.\n\nThe 12 contestants battled themselves with brawn and brains. Each time a man was killed or incapacitated, the lights were turned on and the fallen man’s body removed. This went on until it was just Mallam Ilia and another individual left in the ring.\n\nThere is a palpable suspense. Things begin to look really bad for Ilia when the other contestant (described as an enormous man, big-jawed and long toothed) growls at him and proclaims that Ilia’s knife can do him no harm since he had swallowed the medicine against steel. To prove this, the contestant proceeds to jab himself with his own knife and the steel bent (it turns out that he was wearing a coat of chain-armour).\n\nIf not that Mallam Ilia’s opponent stumbled on his own discarded bent knife which sliced his foot “as easily as the sun pierces the clouds”, Ilia would not have survived that fight, much less thrusting at his opponent’s bare neck to incapacitate him.\n\nThe fact that he only incapacitated and not killed this adversary is something that would haunt Mallam Ilia for the rest of his life.\n\nIt was only after Ilia won Zarah’s hand and was handed over his prize that he heard from the horsemen and a company of women who accompanied them home that Zarah was said to carry bad luck with her. It was rumoured that in the past, her beauty had been known to bring ruin and unhappiness to men.\n\nDeath By the Sword (Episodic diaphragm 2 of Chapter 1).\n\nAt this point, Zarah has settled into her role as Ilia’s wife and for the first year, they were very happy, though he often caught her falling into pensive moods.\n\nUltimately, Ilia was able to piece together Zarah’s backstory from various sources and channels. “The second daughter of Kanemi, Prince of Tuaregs, Kanemi loved her best of all his daughters and betrothed her at an early age to another Tuareg Prince whom she grew to hate. On the night when the horses came to take her to her husband to be, Zarah disappeared and was found some weeks later taking refuge in the house of one of her former woman servants.\n\nAs a man who loved fighting, nothing appealed to Kanemi’s imagination more than gambling Zarah away at a game of Shanchi as payback. He was upset that she absconded as the marriage to the Tuareg Prince would have increased his political influence. It was when he thought of this payback that he embarked on the night ride across town, inviting young men (one of whom was Mallam Ilia) to the Shanchi contest.\n\nIlia was also to learn that just before he won her, Zarah had developed great love for a man by name Mallam Usuman, a man who posed as the son of an Emir; wealthy and influential “fonder of the sword than he was of work”. Friends who knew him advised Ilia to leave town before Usuman recovers from an ailment that currently had him bedridden. Upon further enquiry, Ilia is to learn that Usuman was the same last adversary who he incapacitated but did not kill in Shanchi in order to win Zarah.\n\nShortly after this, Usuman and his men showed up at Ilia’s doorsteps, accusing him of murdering a child. The story goes that Ilia’s favourite horse Wutsia was running loose through town and ran over the child. Though there was no way Ilia could independently confirm this version of events, with Wutsia’s forelegs stained with what appeared to be the child’s blood, Usuman and his goons threw Mallam Ilia in jail.\n\nAt the time, Kano was ravaged by small pox and the cell (an airless little room shared by twenty to thirty men) was not spared, leading to many deaths with the prison wardens often forgetting to evacuate the corpses.\n\nThe year was 1903 and the Emir of Keffi and the Magaji of Zaria had come to seek refuge in Kano because they were badly wanted by the British. It was said that they became fugitives because when the British sent representatives to meet with them, these rulers seized the white man and murdered him. Ilia and other prisoners however believed that it was Usuman, acting without mandate, that seized and murdered the white man emissary.\n\nSo it was that the fall of Kano to the British led to the liberation of Ilia and other prisoners from the Kano prison. Upon his leaving the prison, Mallam Ilia realized that Kano had borne the brunt of the British invasion. What was left of the city bore evidence of preparing for a siege as well as capitulation. When Ilia arrived at what was left of his house, searching through the rubble for his wife, he responded to “the cry of someone in great pain, a person who immediate help would mean everything” and it turned out to be Zarah in peril, being antagonized by Usuman.\n\nUsuman turned on perceiving Mallam Ilia and drew his sword. Mad with rage, unarmed and despite being weak and feeble, Ilia lounged at Usuman recklessly, stumbled on a fallen brick, and barely escaped Usuman’s desperate sword thrust. It would have been Mallam Ilia’s end if Zarah had not seized a club and brought it down on Usuman’s head, knocking him out cold.\n\nAs Usuman lay unconscious, Zarah narrated what she had passed through in Ilia’s absence at Usuman’s hands. How Usuman harassed her relentlessly to elope with him as Ilia, according to him, was going to rot in jail. Ilia asked Zarah to gather her belongings so that they can leave Kano and start a new life elsewhere. It was while Zarah was gathering her jewels, gold and precious stones that Usuman regained consciousness and grabbed Zarah, proclaiming to Ilia “You shall not take her with you”.\n\nIlia thought he saw an opening and thrust his sword at Usuman’s ribs. Unfortunately, Usuman in a flash, clutched Zarah and used her as a shield before his body, thus Mallam Ilia’s sword ran straight through Zarah’s heart.\n\nUsuman mocked Ilia as he fled “ha, ha, ha, I said you wouldn’t take her”.\n\nJust as Ilia was gaining on Usuman, he heard Zarah’s faint voice call out to him as she was about to breathe her last. As her life ebbed away, Ilia promised “Zarah; can you hear me now? I shall not rest, for I shall know no peace until I have avenged you”.\n\nWith her package of jewels and gold under his arm, Mallam Ilia gave his servants some money to arrange a burial fit for the wife of Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia for Zarah, then set off on what was to become his life mission, avenging Zarah’s death.\n\nUsuman, Terror of the North (Episodic diaphragm 3 of Chapter 1).\n\nAbout two weeks after Zarah’s death, Ilia received news that Usuman and his supporters had assembled a large force to retake Kano from the British, and were making their way to Kano from Sokoto. Mallam Ilia enlisted in the British army which had been depleted of men from the earlier battle. His reason for joining the army was to get an opportunity to face Usuman in battle one-on-one. But this was not meant to be at the time. Before he could get such an opportunity, the small British army routed the army of Usuman and his supporters on the battle field.\n\nAt the time, Northern Nigeria was in disarray. Some Emirs had fled and nobody was sure who was in charge during this transition. Travel was also very unsafe as travellers were routinely waylaid, killed or robbed by masked horsemen. Usuman was said to head the most notorious of these group of marauders.\n\nChapter II – Usuman is at Large\n\nThe Indian Woman – (Episodic diaphragm 1 of Chapter 2).\n\nThis chapter starts off establishing that Usuman’s name had become synonymous with banditry and terror in Northern Nigeria. He was once captured, but ultimately almost immediately rescued by his men. This taught Mallam Usuman a lesson so he no longer moved around without three of his best men, all heavily armed.\n\nAfter a botched attempt to rob what he thought was a British cash convoy (turned out that the cases were full of bullets and handcuffs) Usuman lost all his men and for months on, found himself roaming wild with no company save the horse he stole from the convoy.\n\nHe eventually came across another set of travellers who he intended to rob but ended up abducting a beautiful Indian woman who was travelling with them. He rode far into the night with her until he met a nomadic herdsman who gave him shelter. He told the herdsman that he was from Kano, driven out by the British, that the woman was his wife. He lived with this herdsman for about a year, taking most of the herdsman’s milk and other produce without paying.\n\nIt was here that Mallam Ilia stumbled upon him during one of his travels, confronted him in the herdsman’s tent and challenged him to a fight. Usuman managed to escape through the back of the tent after firing off a shot at Ilia, leaving behind a child that was strikingly like him. Ilia refused to seek vengeance on Usuman’s son, rather he took him to Kano despite the traveling hazard it posed and settled the child with friends. After this, the book does not mention the Indian woman again. much later in the book Mallam Ilia also doesn’t seem to have an answer when Usuman asked him about her whereabouts directly.\n\nOne also wonders if the author wanted readers to draw another fortuitous connection between this child and the Kofi Usuman that we met earlier on the train. But again, this was not clearly indicated and if such an inference was expected, will be very well too contrived.\n\nIn further pursuit of Mallam Usuman, Ilia joined a British invasion force that was in pursuit of Satiru, a self-proclaimed Mahdi, a kind of heaven sent religious leader. It was in the campaign that sacked Satiru’s village that Ilia, still searching for Usuman, stumbled upon a drinking house. Not knowing that anyone was there he turned his back to leave and was struck a heavy blow on the back of his head. It was Usuman that hit him. His left arm felt suddenly numb and became paralyzed thereafter.\n\nThe School at Mecca – (Episodic diaphragm 2 of Chapter 2).\n\nMallam Ibrahim Ilia soon realized that it would be futile to continue a life of adventure as he became handicapped after the last incident with Usuman. His left arm was now useless, dead from the crippling blow to the back of his head.\n\nSo he apprenticed himself to Mallam Gobir, a scholar and a man well read in the Koran from whom he learnt great truths and made his life more purposeful. Together they travelled on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1910. This new found knowledge and inner peace made Mallam Ilia think that he must have been a fool ever to think of killing Usuman because he had caused the death of Zarah.\n\nUnfortunately, Mallam Gobir died in Mecca but before he died, asked Ilia to promise him that he will always live according to the Prophet and will do all he can to be good, to propagate the faith. Upon his passing, Mallam Ilia covered Mallam Gobir’s face with a white sheet and made his way to the place of prayer, only to come face to face with Usuman.\n\nAgain, another fortuitous encounter.\n\nWe meet Usuman washing his feet. When he finished, he stood up, took water into his mouth, rinsed it and spat it straight into Mallam Ilia’s face.\n\nBut for Ilia’s decision to abide by his late teacher’s injunction, Usuman’s constant mocking and taunting will not have gone unreplied. At some point, Usuman moved over to Mallam Ilia and whispered in his ear “So you didn’t die!”\n\nThis goaded Ilia to accept yet another duel with Usuman for later that night. It turned out to be a well laid trap. After attempting to attack Usuman, Mallam Ilia was apprehended, bound hand and foot and sent off to prison. The second time Usuman was getting him incarcerated.\n\nMallam Ilia spent two months in jail. Thereafter, a woman named Djie came and demanded his release. She seems to have a connection with Mallam Gobir, because the prison Warden asked Mallam Ilia if he knew Mallam Gobir before releasing him into the custody of Djie.\n\nDjie took Ilia in and got him to run a school teaching young minds the things he learnt from Mallam Gobir. We infer that Ilia soon got into a romantic relationship with Djie though this was not like the burning love he had for Zarah.\n\nOne day Mallam Ilia’s students asked him the right thing for a man to do if somebody kills his wife. When Ilia responded that the right thing to do is to take the man before a Judge, they asked him to tell them about Kanemi, Prince of Tuaregs. Ilia then realized that the students had heard about Zarah and were mocking him.\n\nHe was broken and decided to leave the school. On his way out, he handed over a small laya talisman to the school messenger and asked him to give it to Djie. He told the messenger that the talisman was for Djie to hang on their child’s neck when the child arrives. He further noted that the talisman was a strong protection against evil that Mallam Gobir had taught him.\n\nWe will later better appreciate the prominence to the narrative of this gift to Mallam Ilia’s unborn child.\n\nThe Cameroons Campaign, 1916 – (Episodic diaphragm 3 of Chapter 2).\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, Ilia wandered about Northern Nigeria for a year or two, looking for information on Usuman. He was in Northern Nigeria until the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. Once again, he enlisted in the army, but this time, not as a fighting man given the condition of his hand, but as one of those to work behind the lines, in the Pioneer Corps, the operational logistics and light engineering arm of the British army.\n\nA year later, Ilia met Usuman during the Cameroons campaign though Usuman, as had become almost a tradition, was to escape yet again after almost killing Ilia in a bar room fight.\n\nBefore then, Mallam Ilia had met a learned Mallam attached to the French troops who had heard a lot about Ilia. “Would you like to come with me to French Territory east of the Nigerian border – to places like Fort Lamy, Mandara, Marua and so on?” he asked. When Ilia pointed out that he did not have permission, the Mallam promised to get him a passport after the war.\n\nChapter 3 – Death in the Train\n\nMallam Ilia’s friend obtained the passport for him after the great war and Ilia focused on returning to a peaceful life with the intention of eventually returning to Mecca. After a few years, he settled in Fort Lamy where he traded and pursued the studies he begun under the tutelage of Mallam Gobir. Ilia eventually returned to Nigeria in the early 1930’s and lived peacefully until World War II broke out. In spite of his age, he managed once again to get himself into the British army in 1940.\n\nMallam Ilia travelled with the army to East Africa and came back. While others who enlisted sailed to India and Burma, those of them that had already seen action remained in Nigeria. At the end of the war and late in 1947, Ilia applied to be discharged from the army. At this point the war was long over, he was old and had given up on the idea of avenging Zarah’s death. “All he wanted to do was to go up to Kano, live peacefully for the few years left and wait for the Great One to call him”.\n\nMallam Ilia boarded the train on which this story is narrated. Early in the morning of the day the narration began, Ilia went to the restaurant car to ask for something hot to drink as he had a weakness for strong coffee. He was directed to the dining section only to come face to face with Usuman as the train steward.\n\nIlia threw a knife at Usuman and missed. For the first time in his life, Usuman made a wrong call. He ran out of the carriage, probably with the idea of escaping to another carriage, but the last coach in the train had no door into it: it was a goods van.\n\nIlia followed in pursuit and Usuman and Ilia were now both trapped in the narrow link between the two coaches. The last fight was quite dramatic, but Usuman had also lost a lot of his fire. Ilia’s kick to Usuman’s stomach “stopped him like a car whose brakes suddenly jammed on him”.\n\nAccording to Mallam Ilia; “I was surprised, there had been nothing in that kick —just a mere straightening of my old leg—and there lay Usuman, terror of the North, writhing and gasping with pain. For one desperate moment, his body lay wedged in the yawning aperture. When he realized that he might slip and be crushed to death, he tried to pull himself up by the sheer strength of his arm. I pressed forward to help him, but we were passing over a bridge, and with the jolting, he hit his head on the metal upright. I heard him scream. He held on tight to me and tried to drag me down with him.\n\nIt was a terrible struggle. He held me in that death clutch and I fought to draw back. The knife in my breast-pocket dug into my side and was held there as we rocked with the motion of the train. You’ve seen the wound. When Usuman’s body fell with a sudden crash down on to the bridge I must have fainted.\n\nFrankly, I do not know how I got here. I do not know whether people have heard that the steward is missing.\n\nMy friend, I am going to die. It has been a hard life but Zarah is avenged. I have only one regret, and that is, Allah has not thought it fit for me to see Djie again and explain myself, and to gaze upon the child she bore me”.\n\nEpilogue\n\nIn the Epilogue, we encounter yet another convenient contrived plot device. We learn that the frame-narrator, Hassan, who Mallam Ilia has been narrating this story to, is the son Ilia bore with Djie. Hassan proves this by showing Mallam Ilia the layas-talisman around his waist. Mallam Ilia dies, shortly after Hassan tells him “will you believe me, then, when I tell you that your wife, Djie, my own mother, is now in Jos waiting for me; and you?”\n\n“Don’t….” was Mallam Alhaji Ibrahim Ilia’s last whispered response before he passed.\n\nWe also find out that Kofi Usuman is Inspector Kofi Usuman of the CID. He must have been tracking Usuman and observed the late Mallam Ilia’s suspicious behaviour.\n\nThe book ends with Hassan handing over the passport of Mallam Ilia and the notes he made of the story to Inspector Kofi and both of them driving out of the station in the Inspector’s official car.\n\nAbout the Author, His Style and Literary Influences.\n\nA review of his early life, background, literary influences and adopted style will help us better understand, appreciate and detonate Cyprian Ekwensi’s The Passport of Mallam Ilia.\n\nBorn Cyprian Odiatu Duaka Ekwensi on September 26, 1921, in Minna in present-day Niger State, Ekwensi later moved to Onitsha, Anambra State, where his family was originally from.\n\nEkwensi attended Government College Ibadan, Oyo State; Achimota College in the Gold Coast (now Ghana); and the School of Forestry in Ibadan. He also studied Pharmacy at Yaba Technical Institute in Lagos, the Lagos School of Pharmacy and the Chelsea School of Pharmacy of the University of London. He taught at Igbobi College and also worked as a Pharmacy lecturer in Lagos.\n\nCyprian Ekwensi will later be quoted as saying “I love Nigeria and I know it backwards having been born in the North raised in the West, and of Eastern origin, and every year I go round Nigeria two or three times by car, by road, so I know my country and I love it”.\n\nEkwensi’s father was an Elephant hunter and a traditional storyteller, and this traditional storytelling is evident in Ekwensi’s style of blending traditional themes with a lot of romanticism. In some sense, this style can be described as the African equivalent of the European literature epic journey narrative, just that it is presented in prose and not poetry. Ekwensi’s early writings were mythological fragments and folk tales following in the magical realism tradition of Eastern and Northern Nigeria traditional literature.\n\nThis is why it is quite understandable that he was accused of plagiarizing the 1934 book, Jiki Magayi, (authored by Rupert East and Mallam J. Tafida Zaria) in his “An African Night’s Entertainment” (1962).\n\nIn a defence offered in an interview with the folklorist and biographer Ernest Emenyonu, Ekwensi noted the story as simply a record of a tale once told him by an Hausa man. “It is a folk tale. It is a story which if you live long enough in Northern Nigeria as I did you are bound to hear one day. Everybody who grows up hears it… like the Igbo stories of the tortoise…”\n\nIn the early 1940s Ekwensi enrolled at the School of Forestry in Western Nigeria; successfully completing his degree requirements in 1944, he began his work as a forestry officer. According to Ernest Emenyonu “It was . . . while wandering in the domains of animals and trees that Ekwensi decided to become a writer. Taking advantage of his wild and lonely environment he began to create adventure stories with forest backgrounds.” Among his early works are the short stories “Banana Peel,” “The Tinted Scarf,” and “Land of Sani,” which he published together with a collection of Igbo folk tales under the title Ikolo the Wrestler and Other Ibo Tales (1947). Other early works include When Love Whispers and The Leopard’s Claw; he also published several adventure stories for children.”\n\nAs Ekwensi’s writing evolved however, he became more faithful to psychological realism. Employing a naturalistic narrative technique, his writing can be considered epistolary, though rooted in fiction but delivered very much the way a journalist captures news in real life or a biographer records the life and times of the subject of the biography.\n\nBecause he wrote The Passport of Mallam Ilia at a time significant developments had and were still occurring in pre-independence Nigeria, the story will resonate with students of Nigeria’s pre-independence history or those who have read such historical narratives of the time as Supo Sasore’s “A Platter of Gold: Making Nigeria (1906 – 1960). Mallam Ilia and Mallam Usuman’s Shanchi fight was in 1902 and the train journey was in 1947. Supo Sasore’s historical book throws more light on the conflict between Northern Nigeria’s Emirates and the British invasion forces at the time. The history occurring around him was very fecund and rich material that Ekwensi used to weave some historical context around the activities of the book’s protagonist and antagonist.\n\nDespite his academic background in Pharmacy, Ekwensi was to join the news media in 1951, working for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. That same year, Ekwensi won a government scholarship for further studies in pharmacy at London University. It was on the ship that took him from Nigeria to England that Ekwensi wrote People of the City, uniting those stories he had broadcast on Radio Nigeria into one long story. At the end of the fourteen days during which Ekwensi had secluded himself inside his cabin on the ship, he had completed his first major literary creation. Worthy of note is that when Chinua Achebe became the editor of the legendary orange-backed Heinemann African Writers Series, one of the first books he chose to publish was “People of the City”.\n\nEkwensi is considered by many to be the father of modern Nigerian literature and was the second Nigerian to gain international acclaim for writing with his first novel People of the City (1954), the second major novel to be published by a Nigerian after Amos Tutuola’s Palmwine Drinkard. In addition to being Ekwensi’s first major novel, People of the City has the distinction of being the first West African English novel written in a modern style.\n\nBefore People of the City however, Ekwensi’s first written works were pamphlets. This probably explains his stylistic signature use of episodic diaphragms particularly evident in The Passport of Mallam Ilia and People of the City.\n\nWe all seem to remember Ekwensi’s more popular works like Jagua Nana (1961), and Jagua Nana’s Daughter (1987), but some of his other works that had a significant impact on Nigerians of my generation include; The Drummer Boy (1960), An African Night’s Entertainment (1962), Burning Grass: A Story of the Fulani of Northern Nigeria (1962), The Rainmaker and Other Stories (1965), Iska (1966), Trouble in Form Six (1966), Samankwe in the Strange Forest (1973), Samankwe and the Highway Robbers (1975), and of course, The Passport of Mallam Ilia (1960).\n\nIf I recall correctly, at one point or the other, The Passport of Mallam Ilia, The Drummer Boy, An African Nights’s Entertainment, Trouble in Form Six, and The Rainmaker and Other Stories were all required Literature texts in Nigeria’s secondary schools. Plus, can one every forget the thrill from reading Samankwe and the Highway Robbers?\n\nReferences\n\nAustine Amanze Akpuda (2008), “Cyprian Ekwensi: A Memorial Tribute”, African Writing Online, https://www.african-writing.com/hol/amanzeakpuda.htm, accessed September 1, 2021.\n\nCyprian Ekwensi (1960), “The Passport of Mallam Ilia”, Cambridge University Press, The Pitt Building, Trumpington Street, Cambridge.\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica (Online) Cyprian Ekwensi – Nigerian Author https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cyprian-Ekwensi, accessed September 1, 2021.\n\nErnest Emenyonu (1974 ) “Cyprian Ekwensi”, Evans Brothers\n\nYour Dictionary (Online), “Cyprian Ekwensi”, https://biography.yourdictionary.com/cyprian-ekwensi , accessed September 1, 2021.\n\nZaccheus Onumba Dibiaezue Memorial Libraries (Online), “Cyprian Ekwensi”, accessed September 1, 2021."
