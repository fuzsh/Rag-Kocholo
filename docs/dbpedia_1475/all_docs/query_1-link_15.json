        "text": "Kano categorization\n\nData based on the responses to the functional and dysfunctional questions for each attribute was collected and analyzed to categorize the attributes of retail stores, using the Kano evaluation table. A Kano evaluation table was established using the references of [37, 47, 48]. The format of a pair of questions and the Kano evaluation table are shown in .\n\nTable 3\n\nQuestion typeDysfunctional: “If [the service] did not satisfy [requirement x], how would you feel?”Response optionsI like it that wayIt must be that wayI am neutralI can live with it that wayI dislike it that wayFunctional: “If [the service] satisfied [requirement x], how would you feel?”I like it that wayQuestionableAttractiveAttractiveAttractiveOne-dimensionalIt must be that wayReverseIndifferentIndifferentIndifferentMust-beI am neutralReverseIndifferentIndifferentIndifferentMust-beI can live with it that wayReverseIndifferentIndifferentIndifferentMust-beI dislike it that wayReverseReverseReverseReverseQuestionable\n\nEach response was placed into one of the six Kano categories, based on the evaluation model. A preliminary selection process was performed to exclude the attributes that received a significant number of questionable (Q) scores until the confusion regarding the question was cleared. Attributes with a significant number of reverse (R) scores were also excluded from the analysis initially, as they indicated that the respondents’ perception of a particular attribute was the opposite of the retailers’. These attributes were included in the analysis only after switching the responses of the functional and dysfunctional questions. Once an attribute with a significant reverse score was identified, the responses were switched for all of the responses for that particular attribute, irrespective of whether the original response was reverse. demonstrates the frequency of responses per category. The far-right column of shows the Kano category that was assigned after all of the responses had been analyzed for each feature.\n\nTable 4\n\n#AttributesMost Frequent Category2nd Most Frequent Category3rd Most Frequent CategoryKano Category2Having visually appealing physical facilitiesM (199)I (118)O (39)Must-be10Having merchandise available when customer wants itM (128)I (114)O (82)11Insisting on error-free sales transactions and recordsM (147)I (131)O (58)19Having employees with consistent courteous behaviorM (128)I (109)O (86)27Accepting most major credit cardsM (114)I (110)O (90)25Providing plenty of convenient parkingM (187)I (124)O (43)1Having modern looking equipment and fixturesO (117)A (113)I (108)One-dimensional4Having clean and convenient public areasO (125)I (119)A (80)5Having a layout that makes searching for materials easierO (152)I (90)A (73)7Having to do the work within previously promised timeO (140)I (117)M (66)13Having good-behaved employees who can instill confidence in customerO (128)I (118)A (82)17Having employees who will never be distracted while responding to a requestO (134)I (110)A (97)21Having the willingness to handle returns and exchangesO (153)M (96)I (78)26Having convenient operating hoursO (132)I (127)A (83)28Offering own credit card of the storeO (143)I (103)M (66)6Having a layout that makes moving around in the store easierA (155)I (134)O (60)Attractive9Performing the service right at the first timeA (187)I (140)O (35)14Having the ability to ensure safety during transactionsA (141)I (129)O (65)18Having the ability to providing individual attentionA (137)I (136)O (56)22Paying sincere interest in solving customers problemsA (146)I (109)O (77)23Having competent employees who can handle complaints directly and immediatelyA (175)I (123)O (51)3Having visually appealing service materialsI (175)A (91)O (69)Indifferent8Providing the service right at the previously promised timeI (129)O (93)A (89)12Having knowledgeable employees who can answer questionsI (143)A (81)M (79)15Having employees who can provide prompt servicesI (157)A (83)O (77)16Having well-informed employees who can inform about the exact timing of the serviceI (175)A (85)O (68)20Having employees who will be courteous over the phoneI (150)O (92)A (71)24Offering high-quality merchandiseI (132)A (99)O (98)\n\nAmong the listed 28 attributes related to customer satisfaction in the retail sector, 6 were categorized as basic or must-be attributes: appealing physical facilities, merchandise that is available when the customer wants it, error-free sales transactions, having courteous employees, acceptance of most major credit cards, multiple convenient locations. It is worth noting again that according to the definition of the category, even though the inability to provide these facilities reduces customer satisfaction significantly, providing them does not increase it.\n\nThe second category, the one-dimensional or linear attribute, causes satisfaction that is proportional to the quality of the provided feature and improving them improves customer satisfaction at a constant rate. The attributes in this category are modern-looking equipment and fixtures, clean and convenient public areas, easy storage layout, performance of service when promised, well-behaved employees that boost the customer’s confidence, employees who are focused on the task at hand, willingness to handle returns and exchanges, convenient operating hours, and a store credit card.\n\nThe third category of attributes, attractive and/or motivational, causes customers to be unexpectedly satisfied and instills loyalty to the store. These attributes include a store layout that is easy to navigate, services that are performed correctly the first time, safe transactions, personalized attention, demonstrated sincere interest in solving customers’ problems, and competent employees who can handle complaints directly and immediately.\n\nThe fourth category is the indifferent category, and it includes 7 of the 28 attributes: visually appealing service materials, providing the service correctly when promised, knowledgeable employees who can answer questions, employees who provide prompt services, well-informed employees who can provide accurate information about the exact timing of a service, employees who are courteous over the phone, and high quality merchandise Attributes from this category bring neither customer satisfaction nor dissatisfaction, thus have very little impact on overall customer satisfaction.\n\nThe categorizations are based on the maximum number of responses, which might or might not be significantly higher than the second highest frequent response for the respective attribute. For example, attribute 10, which is having merchandise available when the customer wants it, is categorized as a must-be attribute, based on the 128 most frequent responses; however, the second-highest frequent response for this attribute is “indifferent,” with 114 responses. Similarly, even though 129 respondents (most frequent response for attribute 8) found that providing service at the previously promised time does not make any difference in their satisfaction level, 93 respondents (the second highest frequent response for this attribute) found this feature attractive. Hence, to consider the effect of all of the responses, multiple refined analyses of Kano responses were used and are presented in the following sections.\n\n28 May 2021\n\nPONE-D-21-07256\n\nService Quality Assessment and Enhancement Using Kano Model\n\nPLOS ONE\n\nDear Dr. Kermanshachi,\n\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

This comment provides us opportunity to improve our work. Following modifications are made to address the above comments.\n\nPage 3:\n\nTo enjoy an advantage over its competitors, a service provider must know the attributes that contribute to their customers’ satisfaction. Several studies have employed various research approaches to identifying customer satisfaction characteristics in different sectors as well as the retail sector. Kim et al. (2020) studied customer equity and customer satisfaction in traditional and new retail formats using regression analysis. In another study, Nicod et al (2020) found that providing proactive training will increase the sales value per customer but will not enhance customer satisfaction. Veloso et al (2017) established using a multi-level and hierarchical model that the customer satisfaction and service perceived quality has a significant correlation among them with respect to the retail industry. The above-mentioned studies have a limited scope in a prioritized list of characteristics to focus on when enhancing customer satisfaction in the retail store. Moreover, very little existing literature have determined such characteristics using multiple approaches simultaneously in the retail store. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify, categorize, and rank the traits of retail stores in relation to customer satisfaction. To achieve this goal, the following objectives were formulated: (1) develop a potential list of attributes that affect customer satisfaction; (2) identify the types of attributes (must-be, one-dimensional, attractive, and indifferent), based on customers’ perceptions; and (3) rank and weight the identified attributes. The findings of this study will help retail store service providers understand the relative importance of the attributes, based on the level of their impact on customer satisfaction.\n\nPage 12:\n\nIn parallel with the functional and dysfunctional questions, a self-stated important question was included for each attribute. A scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being not at all important and 7 being extremely important, was provided to determine the relative importance of each attribute to their satisfaction level. Survey was prepared such way so that it can be completed within 15 minutes. The survey questions for this study were reviewed by a committee of experienced faculty members Eastern Mediterranean University. The questions were approved and ensured that research ethics were properly applied.\n\nPage 22:\n\nLimitation\n\nThis study demonstrated the evaluation of customer satisfaction in the retail sector, using the Kano model. It should be noted, however, that the results of this study are mainly representative of young customers, as that was the target group of the questionnaire, and they should not be generalized for customers from other age groups.\n\nSuggestions for future research\n\nThe inclusion of customers from several other age groups as target participants will widen the scope of this research. Similar studies could be performed in different parts of the world with the different economic conditions of the people which will help in identifying the connection between income level and customer satisfaction characteristics for the retail sector if there is any. Similarly, this research could be replicated in sectors other than retail, for example, supply sector, to determine the characteristics to improve for better performance and satisfaction.\n\nSurvey instruction mentioning time required to complete the survey.\n\nReviewer #2: The goal of the article is clear.\n\n1.

Following changes are made to address this comment.\n\nPage 3:\n\nAbstract\n\nSuccess in the retail sector is highly dependent on customer satisfaction. Maintaining a competitive edge depends upon the service providers knowing and enacting what is important to their customers. Multiple studies have employed various research approaches to identifying characteristics of customer satisfaction in different sectors as well as retail sector. However, very few have determined such characteristics using multiple approaches simultaneously in the retail store. This study aims to identify, categorize, and rank the retail store attributes, based on their effects on customer satisfaction. A survey focusing on retail store characteristics that impact customer satisfaction was developed and distributed. Over 400 responses were collected and evaluated, using the Kano model. Results showed that visually appealing facilities and error-free transactions are of prime importance to customers. They are taken for granted, but their absence plays a significant role in customer dissatisfaction. An easy-to-navigate store layout and readily available service increase customer satisfaction, but their absence doesn’t decrease customer satisfaction. Clean public areas and modern-looking equipment are important, and improvements to them increase customer satisfaction at a proportional rate. The findings of this study will assist service providers in realizing the relative importance of the attributes of retail stores and in evaluating the impacts of their current practices on customer satisfaction levels. Such importance will help retail sector policy makers in mandating policies focusing on must-have attributes to preserve customer satisfaction.\n\n2.

This study aimed not only to determine such attributes, but also to rank them so that the retailers could determine which ones were the most important. To fulfill the purpose of the study, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, 28 retail store attributes were determined, a Kano questionnaire was distributed, and Kano model was used to evaluate the attributes. It was explicated in this research that according to the respondents, the fulfillment of different attributes affects customer satisfaction at different levels. Results also indicated that a retail store should have visually appealing facilities in order to sustain satisfied customers, as this is a must-be attribute, the absence of which would significantly decrease customer satisfaction. An easy-to-navigate layout is an attribute from the attractive category that has a proportional relationship with customer satisfaction, but its absence does not cause customer dissatisfaction. Attributes such as providing clean rest areas have a proportional relationship with customer satisfaction. Based on the self-stated importance questionnaire, it was found that most of the attributes with a high level of importance are from the must-be and one-dimensional categories. The findings of this study will help service providers become more knowledgeable about the relative importance of the attributes of retail stores and will enable them to evaluate the impact of their current practices on customer satisfaction levels.\n\nThis study demonstrated the evaluation of customer satisfaction in the retail sector, using the Kano model. It should be noted, however, that the results of this study are mainly representative of young customers, as that was the target group of the questionnaire, and they should not be generalized for customers from other age groups.\n\nThe inclusion of customers from several other age groups as target participants will widen the scope of this research. Similar studies could be performed in different parts of the world with the different economic conditions of the people which will help in identifying the connection between income level and customer satisfaction characteristics for the retail sector if there is any. Similarly, this research could be replicated in sectors other than retail, for example, supply sector, to determine the characteristics to improve for better performance and satisfaction.\n\n7.
