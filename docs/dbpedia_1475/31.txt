Personality[]

Kano is a mercenary and Second-in-Command of the Black Dragon, one of the most dangerous, feared and respected Crime Cartels located in Earthrealm. At first, Kano appeared to be loyal to the Special Forces. However, he was revealed to be a mole for the Black Dragon all along feeding false information to the Special Forces. Many Soldiers were killed in an operation gone wrong, including Sonya's partner. Since then, Sonya has harbored a great hatred for Kano. Kano has amassed a fortune selling his arms to other realms. Kano has become one of his own realm’s biggest threats, willing to betray his own realm and even his own allies for money or personal gain.

Kano gives the impression of an arrogant brute, which he is, but is quite intelligent. He has infiltrated several High Security Facilities and often hacks into computer systems, retrieving the information he is looking for. He rises beyond mere brutality and aggression by being sly and cunning. Kano is highly opportunistic and incredibly selfish.

One of his most notable features is his facetious and twisted sense of humor, almost always making light of dire circumstances. He combines the features of a cowardly minion, a lone survivor, a crazed madman, and a ruthless commander. These features have contributed to Kano's constant survival against all odds.

Despite his ruthless nature, Kano does care about his men, as long as they maintain their usefulness. He pays them well, so long as they do their work, and even saved Kabal's life. That said, he has no problem leaving them behind or killing them if they betray him or become less useful, revealing his care for them was nothing, but a façade and only cares about himself and no one else.

But when he is overmatched by a stronger opponent, he is shown to be an extreme coward, it is shown when he begged Scorpion for mercy in Mortal Kombat 11.
