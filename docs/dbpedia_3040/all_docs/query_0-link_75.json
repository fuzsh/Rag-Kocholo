This design is very easy for beginner character macaron bakers, since the shells are plain circles. Post-bake, the piggies are decorated with dyed white chocolate and edible markers!\n\n*If this is your first time making macarons, check out my more in-depth post on how to make macarons. You can find more pictures, GIFS, and macaron templates on that page! I also recommend reading Mimi’s macaron post.\n\n*Disclaimer: this post contains affiliate links.\n\nRecipe Form\n\n✉️ want to save this recipe?\n\nenter your email and i’ll send it directly to your inbox!\n\n& as a bonus, you’ll get new recipes & resources sent to you every month. 💛\n\nEmail\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nView more\n\nAbout these piggies\n\nWhile going through my Instagram, I realized that even though I posted piggie macarons a few times… I never posted an actual recipe for them! So, I decided to write up this post for anyone interested in in recreating them. <3\n\nLike many of my recipes, I try to make them as cute & easy as possible. Instead of using the macaron batter to pipe on the ears and snouts, I opted for piping plain circles and adding all of the details post-bake. For the ears and nose, I used melted white chocolate dying that I dyed pink. For the eyes, nostrils, and blush, I used edible markers.\n\nI find that decorating this way is much easier for beginners, in comparison to splitting up the macaron batter into multiple colors and piping bags. The decorating process for these pigs make baking character macarons more approachable, especially if it is your first time making a design! BUT, if this is your first time making macarons shells EVER, I recommend checking out my more in-depth post on how to make macarons. You can find more pictures, GIFS, and macaron templates on that page! I also recommend reading Mimi’s macaron post for troubleshooting.\n\nAfter baking and decorating the pig macarons, the shells are sandwiched with a smooth, creamy chocolate ganache. And the best part of the ganache is that it’s made in the microwave. Super easy, right?\n\nSo, let’s get to baking, friends!\n\nMacaron templates\n\nFor these macarons, I wanted CHONKY piggies, so I used the 2-inch macaron template. It yielded 7 pig macarons plus three mini ones. If you use the 1.75-inch macaron template, you’ll get about 12 macarons.\n\nTips for baking and decorating\n\nUse a kitchen scale\n\nMacarons are incredibly finicky. A kitchen scale allows you to measure all the ingredients correctly and helps you create consistent, full, sturdy shells. AND, if you use a cute kitchen scale like this heart-shaped one, it’ll increase your overall happiness by at least 10%.\n\nDecorating with melted chocolate\n\nYou can use a piping bag, cookie scribe, or toothpick to add on the details. I used a toothpick for these guys.\n\nFor the white chocolate, you’ll want to use oil-based food coloring or the chocolate will seize up and become lumpy. However, if you don’t have oil-based food coloring, you can try mixing in a tsp of neutral oil (canola, vegetable) at a time! The chocolate should come back together. Maaagic.\n\nStoring the macarons\n\nStore the macarons in an airtight container. They can last in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to one month! Eat at room temperature.\n\nI really hope you enjoy this recipe. If you make these cute pig cookies, I’d love to see them. You can tag me at #bitesbybianca / @bitesbybianca on Instagram.

Place silicone baking mats or parchment paper on top of templates.\n\nSet up one large piping bag with a medium round tip. If you do not have a round tip, you can just snip the end of the bag before piping.\n\nFor the French macaron shells:\n\nIn a medium bowl, mix the sifted almond flour and powdered sugar.\n\nPour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer. Set up a stopwatch to time how long to whip the meringue. (These times are listed to help beginner macaron makers. With practice, you can go by eye.)0:00 – 4:00 minutes: Add your pink food coloring. Mix on medium-low for 4 minutes (Kitchenaid speed 4).4:00 – 9:30 minutes: Turn the mixer to medium speed (Kitchenaid speed 6). Add a third of the granulated sugar. After 30 seconds, add another third. After another 30 seconds, add the last of the granulated sugar. Keep mixing at medium speed until you have reached a total of 9:30 minutes. The meringue should be balled up onto the whisk, very thick, glossy, and have stiff peaks. If not, keep mixing at 30-second intervals at Kitchenaid speed 8 until it is.\n\nAdd all of the powdered sugar, almond flour to the meringue. Gently fold the macaron batter, often scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Continue folding, adding more pink food coloring as needed\n\nFold the batter until it reaches a thick, glossy consistency and flows off the rubber spatula into ribbons. To test if it is ready, allow the batter to flow off the spatula and into the batter. If the ribbons do not melt into the rest of the batter after 30 seconds, continue folding. Be careful not to over mix. When it passes this test, transfer the batter to your piping bag.\n\nPipe round shells onto your silicone mats/parchment paper, using the round macaron template as a guide. Tap the trays against the counter a few times to get rid of air bubbles. If there are bubbles on the surface, you can use a toothpick or cookie scribe to pop them. Popping the air bubbles helps stop them from cracking when being baked. Remove the templates.\n\nAllow the macarons to sit out at room temperature to dry for at least one hour. They will be ready to bake once the surface of the macaron is matte and dry to the touch. If it is a really humid day, it can sometimes take 2 hours for them to dry.\n\nPreheat the oven to 325F. Place an empty baking sheet upside-down on the middle rack.\n\nPlace the baking sheet with the macarons on top of the upside-down baking sheet. The upside-down sheet will help the macarons bake more evenly, decreasing the chances of cracking. Bake for 15-20 minutes, rotating halfway through. To test if they are done baking, gently push the side of one shell. If it wiggles on the sheet, they need to be baked longer.\n\nRemove the macarons and place them on a wire rack. Bake any remaining macaron shells.\n\nAllow macarons to fully cool before peeling them off the parchment paper or silicone mats.\n\nFor the ganache:\n\nAdd milk chocolate, salt, and heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl.\n\nMicrowave for 45 seconds, then mix. If the chocolate is not fully melted, microwave at 10-second intervals and mix until it is smooth.\n\nPlace bowl into the fridge and stir it every 10 minutes until the ganache is thick enough to pipe, about 30-45 minutes. Transfer ganache to a piping bag.\n\nAssembly:\n\nMatch the macaron shells, lining up each pair on your work surface.\n\nAdd oil-based food coloring to your melted white chocolate for the snout + ears. If you don't have oil-based coloring, your chocolate will seize and become lumpy. To counter this, add in a tsp of neutral oil (canola, vegetable), and mix until it comes back together.Use a toothpick, cookie scribe, or piping bag to add the nose and ears.\n\nUse edible food markers to draw on the eyes, nostrils, and blush.\n\nPipe a dollop of the chocolate ganache on the bottom shell, then add the matching shell on top.\n\nLeave macarons in an airtight container in the fridge for at least 24 hours before eating. This allows them to mature, making them softer, chewier, and more flavorful. Eat at room temperature.\n\nNotes\n\nStore the macarons in an airtight container. They can last in the fridge for up to 5 days,. You can also freeze them for up to one month! Eat at room temperature. This recipe can easily be doubled, tripled, etc.\n\nKeyword animal cookie, animal cookies, character cookie, character cookies, Character Macarons, Chocolate, chocolate ganache, chocolate pig cookies, chocolate pig macaron, Dessert, French macarons, Patisserie, pig cookie, pig cookies, pig macaron, pig macarons\n\nDid you try this recipe?Let us know how it was!"
