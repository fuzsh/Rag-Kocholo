        "text": "This is an intervention....BBH admitted on another thread that she has never cooked porkchops, and has a sizeable hog in her backyard, getting bigger by the moment.\n\nSo for all of us who are raising pigs for the first time, here is a thread for all recipes pig. I will start with my favorite simple pork chop recipe.\n\nIn a large cast iron skillet, brown bone-in chops on both sides in lard or better yet, old bacon grease. Remove browned chops to a plate to get all the chops well-browned. The cheapest chops are best in this recipe.\n\nBrown a large sliced onion or two, and when almost done, add a couple....or a few....cloves of minced garlic and saute' lightly.\n\nAdd water or chicken broth to the pan and deglaze. Add the chops and simmer on low for 45 minutes, re-arranging chops every few minutes so all spend sometime on the bottom. You can cover the pan if you have a cover that fits tightly and re-arrange the chops less often.\n\nJust before serving, put some cold water in a cup and add a heaping spoonful of cornstarch, stirring until smooth. Turn the heat up to get the sauce boiling and add the cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly and boil for a minute or two until the gravy thickens and becomes a bit translucent. Salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat and serve. YUM!\n\nMy mom worked nights and used to cook pork chops like this...\n\nBrown the chops, put them in the slow cooker and add 2 cans of golden mushroom soup. DO NOT add any water. Let is simmer for a couple of hours.\n\nWe would come home from school to a full crock pot. When dad got home we would eat it with rice and a salad. We were sure to save some for mom, but it wasn't easy!\n\nNow I make this and use chicken and mushroom soup because it is much lower in carbs. To make it even better make your own mushroom soup and add that.\n\nIt is getting cooler and it is time to get this recipe quest going....pigs are growing, and mouths are watering!\n\nA friend (my European cheese-taster and cheerleader and all-around cool lady) asked today about head cheese. Specifically, something she thinks is spelled sultze and is German. I couldn't find a recipe online....plenty of head cheese recipes, but none for sultze. ORChick?\n\nI am also looking for a very old-fashioned recipe for cretons, another head cheese made by my Canadian French Memere (grandmother.) The online recipes seem modernized, calling for ground pork and bread crumbs, etc, and not the gelatinous glop that I remember....and found to be absolutely disgusting!\n\nThis is truly love. That I am going to ask the butcher for two cleaned and cut up hogs' heads because I will make sultze for my friend and cretons for my father. Sheesh. Ick-ick-ICK.\n\nETA: I am looking for very old, traditional recipes using basic ingredients and nothing modern....\n\nOur family just received our farm-raised 1/2 a pig this weekend. I must RAVE about the flavor difference, or it could just be all in my head, since I know how our pig was raised and butchered I will never eat another type of pork ever again! We would love to raise our own, but not enough room prohibits us.\n\nThank you for these delish recipes and I look forward to making them Keep em' coming!"
