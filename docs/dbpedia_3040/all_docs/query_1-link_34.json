        "text": "This post was last updated on March 19th, 2024.\n\nMmmm… French food, right?—buttery croissants, the satisfying crunch of a fresh baguette, Julia Child’s enthusiastic “Hello!” as she adds more butter to the pan, delightful macaroons, strong French coffee, exotic frog legs (because why not?), and comforting Ratatouille, a veggie delight that’s like getting a warm hug. And that’s just the beginning!\n\nFrench onion soup, juicy magret de canard à l’orange, classic steak frites, coq au vin, and decadent foie gras. Drooling yet?\n\nWe’re completely hypnotized by the magic of French food, and we bet you are too!\n\nSo we’re here to spill the beans on the crème de la crème of the finest French dishes, brought to you by the very people who know it best— us! Locals who’ve lived and breathed French culture, well, all our lives.\n\nAnd just in time for the Paris Summer Olympics, our list has been freshly updated with new, handpicked favorites that will add some extra zest to your culinary adventures in Paris. Buckle up; you’re in for a stomach-grumbling ride!\n\nTable of contents\n\nPopular Food in France\n\nEasy French Dishes\n\nClassic French Cuisine\n\nTraditional French Food\n\nThe French Diet\n\nFrench Desserts\n\nAll you need to know about French foods\n\nPopular Food in France\n\nYou might have heard of France as the “gourmet nation” and it’s not by chance. France has surely one of the best cuisines in the world.\n\nWith renowned chefs, locals being refined and great eaters, Michelin-star restaurants, bakeries, bistros, brasseries, and other cafes, eating has become for them a way of life and is entirely part of French culture.\n\n1. Steak and French Fries / Steak Frites\n\nThe “steak and fries” is a popular French dish and a quintessential offering at any French brasserie. Accompanied by a fresh salad, this straightforward yet immensely satisfying meal is a favorite among meat enthusiasts. And let’s be honest, is there anything better than perfectly cooked fries to complement a juicy steak?\n\n2. Steamed Mussels with White Wine / Moules Marinières\n\nDiscover mussels as you have never eaten them before: Cooked in white wine with shallots, parsley, and celery stalks.\n\nServed with French fries that you can dip in the broth, you will find the perfect match with a white dry and fruity glass of wine or with a fresh blond beer.\n\nIf you ever go to France, make sure to eat them fresh from the sea on an ocean-view terrace.\n\n3. Ham and butter Sandwich / Jambon-beurre\n\nThe Jambon-beurre sandwich is Paris street food at its best. This great sandwich is all about the quality of the carefully-selected three ingredients: Parisian ham, salty butter, and a fresh baguette.\n\nYou may also want to try the ham and cheese or ham and pickles version!\n\n4. Ratatouille\n\nMore appetizing than the famous Parisian rat, Ratatouille is a thick stewed vegetable mix made of tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchinis, eggplants, onions, and garlic.\n\nThis traditional French meal is commonly served as an accompaniment to meats, especially grilled or roasted, but the real fans can also eat it alone, as a vegetable stew. It can also be part of the main course like ratatouille with lamb chops.\n\n5. Alsace Quiche / Quiche Lorraine\n\nThe Alsatian tradition of a Quiche Lorraine is a tart topped with a mixture of cream, milk, eggs, nutmeg, gruyere cheese, onions, and lardons (bacon). These ingredients give a slightly smoky flavor, which is much appreciated in France.\n\nOriginally the crust was made from bread dough, but this evolved into the lightest, melt-in-your-mouth pasty. It actually just takes one bite of the dish to know just how good a quiche can really be.\n\nIt has also become popular with slight variations such as adding mushrooms or leeks. Nowadays, you can also find more modern versions of the quiche in bakeries and restaurants.\n\n6. Macarons\n\nTo continue our list of popular French recipes and food, we are naming… The macarons.\n\nMacarons, in France, are made with almond flour, egg white and sugar. Good macarons need to be crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. But at the same time, they need to melt in your mouth.\n\nThey come in a vast array of flavors and colors such as strawberry, coffee, vanilla, lemon, chocolate etc.\n\nThey’re not easy to transport or store, so they must be eaten quickly, usually the day they are baked. What a shame, right?\n\n7. Croque-Monsieur\n\nThe Croque-Monsieur is a traditional French sandwich made of butter, mustard, ham, and cheese. It’s eaten after being toasted so you can enjoy the melted cheese coming off the warm and crispy bread. Some recipes include a bechamel sauce on top, but this is not always the case.\n\nThe perfect dish to make at home if you’re in a hurry!\n\n8. Tartar Steak / Steak tartare\n\nSteak tartare is a classic long-standing French bistro plate of ground raw meat served with a raw egg yolk on top. It is then seasoned to your preference with sliced pickles, salt, pepper, shallots, capers, English sauce, and dipping sauces such as mustard, mayonnaise, or ketchup. It comes with French fries or mixed greens.\n\nNowadays, a few people might still have some doubts about trying this dish, but we can guarantee that the daring ones will be highly and tastefully rewarded.\n\nEasy French Dishes\n\n9. Omelet / Omelette\n\nOne of the most popular french foods might be the “Omelette”. Scrambled eggs and a spoon of water or milk, is the secret to cooking an amazing omelet.\n\nPopular add-ins for this dish can include ham, a pinch of gruyère, and mushrooms.\n\nBut did you know “Omelette du Fromage” is not a thing in France?\n\n10. Soupe à l’oignon / French Onion Soup\n\nWhat can be a more classic French dish than the “Soupe à l’oignon”? A popular dish from the 18th century this traditional French soup was seen as a poor person’s dish.\n\nA rich blend of onions and beef stock, topped with melted cheese. Its unique flavor comes from caramelized onions and sometimes brandy or sherry.\n\n11. Nicoise salad / Salade Niçoise\n\nThe Salade Nic̝oise is a typical French salad from the Provence region that includes lettuce, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, tuna, anchovies, and olives. This salad named after the city of Nice is eaten as a light meal or as a starter.\n\n12. œufs mimosas (Deviled Eggs)\n\nA refreshing start or a petite plaisir at any French gathering, œufs mimosas are France’s delightful take on deviled eggs. Hard-boiled eggs are halved and filled with a creamy mix of egg yolk, mayonnaise, mustard, and often a hint of shallots or chives for an added punch. Served chilled, they’re the perfect bite-sized appetizer to tease the palate.\n\n13. gésiers de canard (Duck Gizzards)\n\nGésiers de canard, a rustic yet refined dish, showcases the depth of French culinary tradition. These duck gizzards are slow-cooked until tender, often with duck confit or in duck fat, which imbues them with a rich, irresistible flavor. Sliced thinly and served warm atop a bed of leafy greens, they make for a hearty addition to the French starter lineup.\n\n14. Saucisse au couteau (Hand-chopped Sausage)\n\nSaucisse au couteau, a testament to the art of charcuterie, involves coarsely chopped, seasoned meat encased in natural casings. This handcrafted approach ensures a texture and flavor complexity unmatched by mass-produced sausages. Grilled or pan-fried, these sausages are a robust start to any meal, pairing beautifully with a simple side of Dijon mustard or pickled onions.\n\nClassic French Cuisine\n\n15.
