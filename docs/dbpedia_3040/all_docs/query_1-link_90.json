Poser was slang for “making somebody wait” and lapin or “rabbit” was slang for a lady of the night. And so, it meant to leave the girl waiting for payment, and over the decades has come to mean standing someone up.\n\nAvoir la gueule de bois\n\nMeaning: to be hungover\n\nLiteral translation: to have a wooden mouth\n\nThis French saying describes the heavy, dry feeling in your mouth (gueule is slang for mouth), like wood. The clever Belgians take this saying a step further, giving the hangover a faux medical term “xylostomiasis” made of the Greek word xylo for wood and stomia for mouth.\n\nUn coup de foudre\n\nMeaning: love at first sight\n\nLiteral translation: a bolt of lightning\n\nOriginally un coup de foudre was used as a metaphor to describe an unexpected and unpleasant event. That the French would then associate an idiom for an unpleasant event with falling in love doesn’t fit our notions of the French as incurable romantics.\n\nFaire la grasse matinée\n\nMeaning: to sleep in\n\nLiteral translation: to sleep in, or to have a lie-in\n\nThe French were having ‘fat mornings” as far back as the 16th century. But why fat? Could it be because it is associated with soft, creamy things like a cozy bed? Another explanation: 18th-century linguists hypothesised that sleeping in helped you put on weight (voluptuousness being a much-admired thing in those days).\n\nMettre son grain de sel\n\nMeaning: to stick one’s nose in\n\nLiteral translation: to put one’s grain of salt\n\nObviously, a grain of salt is not worth much, so this is used in a negative sense: giving your opinion when no one has asked for it. In English when we say we take something with a grain of salt, we are also using the grain of salt as a metaphor for something worthless. These expressions originate from a Latin expression, cum grano salis.\n\nAvoir la patate\n\nMeaning: to be full of beans, to be in excellent form\n\nLiteral translation: to have the potato\n\nThe origins of this idiomatic French expression aren’t clear, perhaps people thought the potato had a nice shape. The French saying was first used early in the 20th century, then in the 70s a derivative emerged, avoir la frite or have the chip/French fry. During the coronavirus epidemic, the expression had a resurgence, and the meaning was a more general \"to be in good health\"\n\nRaconter des salades\n\nMeaning: tell stories, spin yarns.\n\nLiteral translation: to tell salads\n\nA salad is made up of a lot of different ingredients that are easy and pleasant to digest. And so, when you tell a tall tale or implausible story, you need to serve up to the listener a mixture of facts, half-facts, distortions, and exaggerations – a salad of lies.\n\n9 Funny French Idioms\n\nAller se faire cuire un œuf\n\nMeaning: go jump in the lake\n\nLiteral translation: go and cook yourself an egg\n\nThis expression is on the familiar side (so don’t use it on your boss), but it seems a pretty mild way to tell someone to leave you alone. It’s another one with unknown origins, but the most popular explanation is that it goes back to the days when the kitchen was the woman’s domain, and most men didn't know how to cook. So, the implication was a wife telling her husband: Go cook an egg! Oh, that's right – you don't know how!\n\nAvoir d’autres chats à fouetter\n\nMeaning: to have bigger fish to fry\n\nLiteral translation: to have further cats to whip\n\nAs we shall see, the French like their cat idioms. This is another French expression with no clear origin. Some suggest it is a derivative of another expression, il n’y a pas de quoi fouetter un chat – see below.\n\nIl n’y a pas de quoi fouetter un chat\n\nMeaning: no need to get your knickers in a knot\n\nLiteral translation: there is nothing to whip a cat about\n\nThis French idiomatic expression dates from the 17th century. Cats are pretty quick on their feet, so although I’ve never tried it, I imagine that whipping a cat would be next to impossible. Therefore, whipping a cat is akin to a useless, futile action\n\nPipi de chat\n\nMeaning: something of no importance\n\nLiteral translation: cat wee\n\nIn French slang, it means an insignificant, unimportant thing – though whoever invented the phrase has obviously never tried to get it out of the carpet. It’s also used to describe poor-quality wine, but I think that's universal, not just a French thing.\n\nLes doigts dans le nez\n\nMeaning: to do something easily\n\nLiteral translation: fingers in the nose\n\nThis conjures a funny mental image of someone performing a task with their fingers in their nose. Its origins, however, stem from horse racing, where a jockey is winning so comfortably that they don't need both hands on the reins.\n\nDonner de la confiture aux cochons\n\nMeaning: to cast pearls before a swine\n\nLiteral translation: to give jam to the pigs\n\nThis expression originates from the Bible. English uses the original Bible expression “casting pearls before swine”, but the French give it a culinary twist. Giving delicious jam to a pig would be a complete waste because pigs will eat any rubbish you give them.\n\nSe noyer dans un verre d’eau\n\nMeaning: (to be unable to cope with the slightest difficulty)\n\nLiteral translation: to drown in a glass of water\n\nThe meaning is quite clear: you’d have to be very inept or hopeless to manage to drown in a glass of water. Even droler was the expression they had back in the 18th century: se noyer dans un crachat or “drown in spit”.\n\nÀ boire ou je tue le chien!\n\nMeaning: Service! And make it quick!\n\nLiteral translation: Bring me a drink or I’ll kill the dog!\n\nI’m not sure how often this expression is used in daily life in France, but it’s funny enough to be used as a podcast title, a comic book, and a t-shirt slogan. It’s said/shouted to show that you want to be served quickly. Apparently, in the Middle Ages, the wine barrels were guarded by dogs, so if the customer wasn’t served, he would threaten to serve himself and kill the guard dog to do it.\n\nParler français comme une vache espagnole\n\nMeaning: to butcher the French language\n\nLiteral translation – to speak French like a Spanish cow\n\nLet’s hope no one says this to your face because it is not complimenting your French skills. Originally in the 17th century, the French idiom was to “speak like a Spanish Basque” (the word for Basques being vasces). Over the centuries, variations of this expression have emerged, such as parler comme une vache espagnole, and parler anglais comme une vache espagnole, both implying an inability to speak a second language.\n\n5 Clever French Idioms\n\nAvoir la moutarde qui monte au nez\n\nMeaning: to lose your temper\n\nLiteral translation: to have the mustard climbing up to the nose\n\nIf you’ve ever eaten too much hot mustard you will know the sensations: watery eyes, flushed face, runny nose. In other words, these are involuntary physical reactions, similar to when someone loses their temper and begins displaying involuntary physical effects.\n\nÊtre comme une poule qui a trouvé un couteau\n\nMeaning: to be at a complete loss for what to do\n\nLiteral translation: to be like a hen who has found a knife\n\nActually, this expression can be used in three ways: to describe someone clumsy (as a hen would be with a knife), to describe someone who is disconcerted and confused (the way a hen would be with something it doesn’t know what to do with), and also it can be used to describe an absurd situation.\n\nManger/bouffer/sucer les pissenlits par la racine\n\nMeaning: to be dead\n\nLiteral translation: to eat/suck the dandelions by the root\n\nNo explanation is needed for this very morbid French idiom, especially if you know that in the 19th century when the expression originated, many people were buried directly in the ground (without coffins). Clever idiom, though I wouldn’t name a restaurant after it, as someone has in the Breton town of Brest.\n\nAvoir un cœur d’artichaut\n\nMeaning: to fall easily in love\n\nLiteral translation: to have an artichoke heart\n\nArtichokes, you may know, are a vegetable where layers of leaves protect the edible part, the ‘heart’ of the vegetable. But the original expression was slightly longer, cœur d’artichaut, une feuille pour tout le monde or “artichoke heart, one leaf for everyone”, the meaning being “lots of leaves, lots of loves”.\n\nS’en moquer comme de l’an quarante\n\nMeaning: to not care less\n\nLiteral translation: to care as little about it as the year 40.\n\nOver the ages, there were several prophecies that the world would end in the 40th year of a century, eg 1040, 1740, 1840. Naturally, none of these predictions came true, allowing everyone to poke fun at these superstitious beliefs.\n\n4 French Idioms with Literary Origins\n\nRevenir à ses moutons\n\nMeaning: to get back on topic\n\nLiteral translation: to go back to one’s sheep\n\nThis expression comes from a 15th-century French comedy, La Farce de Maître Pathelin by Anonymous. A trader, Guillaume, is cheated first by someone selling him sheets then has his sheep stolen by a shepherd. Guillaume takes the stolen sheep case to court but in recounting what happened, keeps mixing up the details of the sheet case and the sheep case. The confused judge then orders Guillaume: Revenons à ces moutons!\n\nAvoir le cafard\n\nMeaning: to be feeling down\n\nLiteral translation: to have the cockroach\n\nMost people agree that this French idiom was invented by the French poet Charles Baudelaire in his masterwork, Les Fleurs du mal as a metaphor for melancholy. Less clear is why he would choose to associate the irrepressible cockroach with sorrow and dejection.\n\nTomber dans les pommes\n\nMeaning: to faint\n\nLiteral translation: to fall in the apples\n\nThis French idiomatic expression is believed to be derived from an expression invented by the French novelist George Sand to describe a great tiredness, “being in the cooked apples”.\n\nUn train de sénateur\n\nMeaning: to move slowly\n\nLiteral translation: a senator’s train\n\nThis expression doesn’t originate from a frustration with the slow pace of political decision-making, but rather to describe the solemn processional manner that Roman senators entered the forum. The great French writer Le Fontaine was one of the first to use it as a metaphor in his Fables: “The Hare lets the Tortoise move in his senatorial train…”\n\nConclusion\n\nLearning French idioms is not only an engaging aspect of language acquisition but also a valuable tool for gaining insight into the culture and history of France. Idioms offer unique ways to express emotions and ideas, enriching your language skills and allowing you to communicate with precision and flair. Whether you're drawn to the funny, common, or clever idioms, these expressions will enhance your understanding of the French language and its rich heritage.\n\nAuthor\n\nNick Dennis\n\nNick is an English teacher who has taught English as a Foreign Language in China, Italy and France.
