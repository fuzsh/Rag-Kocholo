        "text": "More and more swine producers are hearing about Official ID products. There are two main categories when it comes to Official ID for Swine - 840 tags and Swine Premises tag.\n\n840 Tags\n\nWhat is an 840 tag?\n\n840 tags are USDA approved tags for official individual animal identification. They will have a unique 15 digit number that always starts with “840” which is the country code for the US. A manufacturer has to be approved by the USDA to produce a specific 840 tag.\n\nWhat is a common use for 840 tags in Swine?\n\nIncreasingly 840 tags are being required for swine shows, state and county fairs and auctions. They can also be used for interstate commerce.\n\nHow do I purchase 840 tags?\n\nYou must have a registered Premises ID before you can purchase 840 Tags. If you don’t have your Premises ID you should start with contacting your State Animal Health Agency. You can find your respective state’s contact information by clicking here.\n\nOnce you have your Premises ID you can order your 840 tags and tag applicator by Destron Fearing from Hog Slat. (See chart below)\n\nSwine Premises (PIN) tags:\n\nWhy is a Swine Premises tag commonly referred to as a PIN tag?\n\nSwine Premises tags are official location identification for cull breeding stock (cull sows and boars). The minimum requirement is for them to be used on cull breeding animals just prior to entering harvest channels from their farm of origin.\n\nWhat does PIN stand for?\n\nPremises Identification Number. It is a unique 7 character alpha-numeric national site identifier.\n\nCan I use them for identifying feeder pigs/weaner pigs for movement and/or show pigs?\n\nNo, they are for use with animals in the breeding herd only.\n\nWhy was January 1st, 2015 important for Swine Premises tags?\n\nThat was the date that the swine industry and packers/processors agreed on to make PIN tags a requirement of sale. If a producer wants to receive full value for their cull breeding animals from that date forward, the animals need an Official Swine Premises tag in their ear before leaving their farm of origin.\n\nWhen should I apply the PIN tags to my animals?\n\nMost producers are applying them to new breeding animals as they enter the breeding herd and are using it as their management tag. You may also apply them when culling an animal from the farm, just prior to the animal entering harvest channels.\n\nHow do I purchase Swine Premises (PIN) tags?\n\nYou must have a registered Premises ID (National 7 character alpha-numeric ID) before you can purchase Swine Premises Tags. If you don’t have your Premises ID you should start with contacting your State Animal Health Agency. You can find your respective state’s contact information by clicking here.\n\nOnce you have your Premises ID you can order your Swine Premises tags and tag applicator by Destron Fearing™ from Hog Slat.
