I recommend this place to anyone looking for wings or BBQ.\n\nThe Dixie Pig is the best BBQ in the greater Charlotte area. The onion dip and pimento cheese appetizers are both fantastic and served with fresh fried chips. The pork sundae (pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad & vinegar based sauce) is my favorite thing on the menu!\n\nOur food was awesome and the service was excellent! The BBQ was excellent and our black eyed peas and collards were delicious! We will be coming back soon!! It really does not matter that this restaurant is located beside a laundry!! The only thing that we saw that needed improvement was the condition of the parking lot. We will share with our friends how delicious this restaurant's food is for sure!\n\nThe food was fantastic. We had some of the best pumpkin pie, banana pudding and pecan pie we have ever had. As for the barbecue, it was moist and flavorful without the sauce. Their food preparation is fast and professionally organized on plate.\n\nThis place is fantastic!! It's a hopping place but still keeps great service. It was just my son and myself in from Pennsylvania, but we ordered 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 6 sides. because we wanted to try so many things. EVERYTHING was great, but the Mac and cheese, wings, and the brisket were our favorites."
