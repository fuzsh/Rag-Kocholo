        "text": "There is no overall animal welfare Act in France. Rather, animal protection provisions are laid out in the Penal Code and the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code. Under the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code and the Penal Code, animals who are owned have protection from deliberate acts of cruelty and neglect. Article 521-1 of the Penal Code makes it an offence to seriously physically abuse or sexually abuse, to commit an act of cruelty to, or to abandon a domesticated animal, or a tamed animal, or an animal held in captivity. There are exemptions for bullfighting where an uninterrupted local tradition can be invoked, and for cockfighting in localities where an uninterrupted tradition can be established.\n\nThere are more detailed animal welfare provisions in the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, as Chapter IV is dedicated to animal protection. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food’s website explains that animal abuse may be characterised by physical beatings and by situations of deprivation or neglect, and that the law covers both. For instance, under Articles L-214 to L-217 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, animal abuse includes depriving companion animals of food and water, or failure to provide a suitable environment. Another example of neglect being considered animal cruelty is that under Articles L-214 to L-218 of the Rural Code, it is considered abuse to keep outdoor cattle, sheep, goats and horses without providing facilities to protect them from climatic conditions. However, the practice of force-feeding ducks and geese to produce foie gras is exempted from anti-cruelty legislation.\n\nAccording to Article R214-17 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, ill-treatment of animals include:\n\n- to deprive them of food or water necessary to meet their physiological needs;\n\n- to leave them without care in the event of illness or injury;\n\n- to place and maintain them in a habitat or an environment likely to be inappropriate to the climatic conditions bearable by the species or the unsuitability of the materials, installations or layout used, a cause of suffering, injury or accident;\n\n- to use, unless absolutely necessary, fastening or restraining devices as well as fences, cages or more generally any form of detention unsuitable for the species under consideration or likely to cause injury or suffering.\n\nSimilarly, according to Article R214-18 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, the fact of keeping cattle, sheep, goats or horses in the open air is considered ill-treatment when:\n\n- there are no devices and installations intended to avoid the suffering that could result from climatic variations;\n\n- the absence of fences, natural obstacles or a sufficient number of fastening or restraint devices is such as to put them at risk of an accident.\n\nThe laws concerning deliberate and intentional cruelty do not apply to wild animals, although conservation measures are in place for mutilation, destruction, capture and poaching of endangered or protected species in the Environment Code and Ministerial Orders list protected species.\n\nThe Law for the balance of agricultural trade relations and healthy and sustainable food was adopted on 2 October 2018. This legislation primarily focuses on improving animal-based production and contains various animal welfare measures. Notably, the law establishes:\n\nExtension of the offense of animal abuse in breeding to transport and slaughter activities;\n\nDoubling of the sentences for animal abuse from six months imprisonment and a €7,500 fine to one-year imprisonment and a €15,000 fine (through modifying Article L.215-11 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code);\n\nAnimal protection associations may bring civil action when official controls have revealed ill-treatment of animals;\n\nDesignation of an animal protection officer in each slaughterhouse with whistleblower status granted to all employees;\n\nExperimentation with video surveillance in voluntary slaughterhouses;\n\nBan on the use of any new or refurbished building rearing egg-laying hens in cages.\n\nThe first Animal Legal Code in France, compiling all the legislation applicable to animals, was published on 22 March 2018, with the intention to be used by magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers or even veterinarians.\n\nAnalysis\n\nIt is positive that French law prohibits cruel acts towards animals, and that neglect is included within the definition of animal cruelty. Furthermore, France should be recognised for prohibiting the abandonment of companion animals.\n\nHowever, it is regrettable that anti-cruelty provisions apply only to companion, tame or captive animals in French legislation, thus leaving out wild animals. There are no basic provisions against cruelty and abuse applicable to wild animals. Wild animals are also excluded from the definition of animals being sentient.\n\nThere is some lack of regard for the suffering of animals used in certain production or leisure activities that the French deem to be traditional practices, but which many other countries have banned on grounds of involving unacceptable cruelty towards sentient animals. For example, cockfighting and bullfighting are permitted in France in areas where an uninterrupted tradition can be shown or demonstrated (Article 521-1 of the Penal Code). The force-feeding of ducks and geese is also required for foie gras production (Article L654-27-1 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code).\n\nThe website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, which is the government Ministry responsible for animal protection, gives information on its website about its responsibilities, about work carried out in consultation with animal protection organisations, scientists and other professionals, and about its funding of research programs on the welfare of animals. The Ministry advises that local authorities, the Departmental Directorates of Protection of Populations, are responsible for implementing animal protection legislation, for example by carrying out inspections. The Ministry states that its services conduct 15,000 inspections annually to ensure animal protection.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Food’s website draws attention to current societal changes, which include debates on the status of the animal leading up to the 2015 amendment to the Civil Code, a growing media coverage of animal welfare issues in rearing and slaughter as well as dietary changes, such as a higher consumer demand for organic, vegetarian or vegan products. In addition, the Ministry also highlights a growing contestation of French agricultural production system by animal protection organisations. This change is significant in terms of how the Ministry portrays animal welfare organisations: whereas in 2014, the Ministry’s website stated that animal welfare charities were empowered to draw attention to cruel or ill treatment of animals to bring about an investigation, the Ministry now merely states that animal protection organisations contest French agricultural production. This appears to be a more negative portrayal of animal welfare organisations.\n\nThere are well-established animal protection organisations in France, which are entitled to become party to prosecutions and to work with the authorities, for example, on investigations into mistreatment of animals and to assist with confiscation of animals. The animal welfare organisation One Voice exposes cases of cruelty against animals, rescues animals wherever possible and files lawsuits against perpetrators, emphasising that violence against animals is tangibly linked to violence against humans. Since current animal cruelty cases are dealt with by a Prosecutor in charge of environmental affairs, One Voice has launched a petition to obtain the appointment of a Prosecutor for violent actions towards all sentient beings, human or animal. One Voice reports that even when the most extreme cases of cruelty are prosecuted by the authorities, which is not always the case, it may take several years to finally obtain a sanction for the perpetrator.\n\nAnother animal protection organisation key in revealing animal cruelty cases is L214 – named after the article in the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code establishing animals as sentient – which focuses on farm animals. L214 conducts undercover investigations and has managed to attract media coverage and public outcry with its videos shot by hidden cameras in farms or slaughterhouses. In 2015, following the release of an L214 undercover video, a foie gras producer has for the first time appeared in court in France accused of ‘serious animal cruelty’. As a result, several renowned chefs have agreed to stop ordering foie gras from this production facility.\n\nThe exemptions given to activities involving extreme cruelty such as cock fighting, and the cultural acceptance of such activities, are barriers to improving animal welfare in France. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food promotes on its website the production of ‘home-made’ foie gras. Presented as ‘good’ and easy to make, no mention is made of how foie gras is inherently cruel to the animals who are force-fed to the point that their liver reaches 10 times their normal size. Even more worrying is that the Ministry’s website presents foie gras as something ‘natural’ discovered 3,000 BC. It is here crucial to underscore that if geese indeed naturally over- feed themselves before travelling long distances, this natural phenomenon is not at all comparable to the industrial force-feeding of both geese and ducks that is being done today. This article is highly misleading and this is regrettable that the Ministry encourages the production and consumption of a product made out of animal cruelty. It clear that France’s economic interests –as France is the first producer and consumer of foie gras worldwide – are given priority by the Ministry compared to animal welfare considerations.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms\n\nThere are enforcement mechanisms in the Penal Code for offences relating to cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals covered by the law, namely domestic, tamed and captive animals. Depending on the gravity and the circumstances in which the acts were carried out, the Penal Code distinguishes:\n\n- involuntary damage to the life or integrity of animals (R653-1 of the penal code) [1]\n\n- ill-treatment of animals (R654-1 of the Penal Code)\n\n- intentional harm to the life of an animal (R655-1 of the Penal Code), serious ill-treatment or acts of cruelty to animals and the abandonment of animals (521-1 of the Penal Code).\n\nThe penalty for the most serious cruelty issues, including abandonment of animals, is up to two years of imprisonment and/or up to a €30,000 fine (Article 521-1). There are five other classes of offences of which class 1 is the least serious and class 5 the most serious. The penalties for some classes of offence are so low that they are unlikely to act as a significant deterrent and/or as an impetus for police and prosecutors to take action. A class 1 offence, for example, currently has a penalty of a €38 fine, a class 2 offence a fine of €150, and a class 5 offence a fine of €1,500 (Article 131-13 Penal Code).\n\nDepartmental Directorates in charge of Population Protection (DDCSPP), which include, among others, Departmental Veterinary Services, have authority to intervene directly on the ground in situations involving the abuse of animals. They may directly, or together with the gendarmerie and the police, take appropriate action. Notably, in the event of reports of ill-treatment, the DDCSPP may directly or under the authority of the prefect (administrative police powers), implement the following measures:\n\n- Request immediate measures to remedy the shortcomings noted;\n\n- Mandate a veterinarian to establish a clinical assessment of the state of the animals and their living conditions, with a view to carrying out their care;\n\n- Proceed with the removal of animals to save them from a situation of mistreatment;\n\n- Have euthanasia performed, if necessary, by a veterinarian on the animals found to be physiologically destitute or seriously ill.\n\nThe DDCSPP can also intervene under the authority of the public prosecutor (judicial police powers), following a complaint for example, and draw up a report of offenses for transmission to the prosecution.\n\nPrefects in local authorities have powers to intervene in cases of ill treatment and neglect of animals (Article R214-17 Penal Code).\n\nAdministrative police measures are also available to town mayors to intervene in in certain cases. Inspections to monitor animal welfare are carried out by officers of health and animal welfare of the Departmental Veterinary Services checking, for example, the level of care provided to animals and the conditions in which animals are kept. The police have powers to intervene directly in instances of animal cruelty under control of the prosecutor.\n\nSection 7 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code lays out that civil servants or designated agents have the power to inspect facilities, homes and vehicles transporting animals to verify that the corresponding animal protection articles of the Code are duly applied.\n\nIn addition, Article L215-11 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code lays out that anyone operating an establishment for the sale, grooming, transit, guard, education, training or presentation to the public of companion animals, a pound, a refuge, a slaughterhouse, a company transporting live animals, or a farm to exercise or let exercise unnecessarily ill-treatment of animals in its care, is liable to a €15,000 fine and one-year imprisonment.\n\nKey recommendations\n\n• The Government of France has enacted extensive anti-cruelty legislation, which prohibits mistreating animals, as well as a failure to act in case of animal abuse. The Government of France should lead by example and encourage countries to enact detailed animal protection legislation, protecting the Five Freedoms of animals. However, the animal protection provisions laid out in the Penal Code and the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code do not apply to wild animals. The Government of France is therefore strongly encouraged to extend the scope of application of these Codes, so that it applies to all vertebrates, cephalopods and decapod crustaceans, including those living in the wild.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to remove the cultural exemption for local and cultural traditions, currently enshrined in Article 521-1 of the Penal Code, which allows the cruel bullfighting and cockfighting practices to continue.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to ban the force-feeding of ducks and geese, currently used for foie gras production, as this practice is inherently cruel and has been banned in other countries, such as the UK and Austria, on animal welfare grounds.\n\nRearing\n\nAt the EU level, the 1976 European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes lays out general conditions for all the species of animals kept for the production of food, wool, skin, fur or for other farming purposes. Article 3 mandates that ‘animals shall be housed and provided with food, water and care […] appropriate to their physiological and ethological needs’. Article 4 protects the freedom of movement of animals and Article 5 regulates the lighting, temperature, humidity, air circulation, ventilation and other environmental conditions.\n\nBased on this European Convention, Council Directive 98/58/EC gives general rules for the protection of animals of all species kept for the production of food, wool, skin or fur or for other farming purposes, including fish, reptiles of amphibians. Article 2 mandates that all animals whose welfare depends on frequent human attention shall be inspected at least once a day. Article 7 protects the animals’ freedom of movement, and Article 10 requires that breeding procedures (natural or artificial) likely to cause suffering or injury must not be practised, though there are exceptions to this. Article 21 further states that no animal shall be kept for farming purposes unless it can reasonably be expected, on the basis of its genotype or phenotype, that it can be kept without detrimental effect on its health or welfare.\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to farm animals (Article 521-1).\n\nThere is a wealth of legislation covering the welfare of animals used in farming with respect to rearing, transport and slaughter, which is based on the legal framework provided by the European Union, and which reflects the minimum standards set by the European Union.\n\nArticle L214-1 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code provides that animals should be kept under conditions compatible with their biological requirements. Article L214-3 prohibits the abuse of domestic animals and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent suffering. Those Decrees that have been made include the implementation of European Union Directives on the welfare of calves, pigs, laying hens, conventionally reared meat chickens and a general welfare framework Directive.\n\nThe framework European Union Directive is implemented by the Decree of 25 October 1982 on rearing and keeping of animals. The requirements of this Decree include maintaining animals in a state of good health, avoiding unnecessary suffering, not keeping animals in the dark or in permanent light, providing sufficient water and food, and protecting animals kept outdoors from inclement weather and from predators. This law also contains provisions relating to the sale of animals in markets and fairs.\n\nHowever, the law relating to the production of foie gras still requires the force-feeding of ducks and geese in order for the product to be labelled as such, and this is protected as part of France’s cultural and gastronomic heritage (Article L654-27-1 Rural and Maritime Fishing Code).\n\nIn addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food has published a global strategy for animal well-being running from 2016 to 2020. The Strategy is organised around the five key pillars and 20 actions.\n\n1. Share knowledge and innovation: broadly, this theme aims at encouraging innovation and the sharing of knowledge with regards to animal welfare. It also aims at creating a national Reference Centre for Animal Welfare, which was done in 2017.\n\n2. Increase the responsibility of actors at all levels: increase the collaboration with between farmers and animal welfare organisations. This pillar also emphasises the ‘primary’ role of livestock farmers in ensuring welfare standards.\n\n3. Pursue the changes in practices in favour of animal welfare: during rearing, transport and slaughter, and for animals used in scientific research. Measures are evoked but only in vague terms (e.g. alternative methods to castration or beak conditioning), with no legally binding character as of now.\n\n4. Prevent and increase the rapidity of action in case of animal mistreatment: improve the training of control services, raise prosecutors’ awareness about the importance of pursuing legal action in case of animal mistreatment. A collective reflection (study) should be done with regards to how to fund measures intended to rescue abused animals. Concrete measures falling under this pillar is that the crime of animal mistreatment is extended to transport and slaughter conditions, instead of only the rearing stage. Penalties are also doubled in case of animal mistreatment, which was achieved through the EGalim law. Animal protection organisations can now file lawsuits to denounce a case of animal mistreatment.\n\n5. Inform the public of the progress and results of this action plan: sharing knowledge with the public, which may be translated by a change in product labelling, and engage with agribusinesses and retailers.\n\nThis National Strategy was incorporated in the broader framework of the Agriculture and Food ‘EGalim’ Legislation, promulgated on 1 November 2018.\n\nRearing – pigs\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for pigs are laid out in Council Directive 2008/120/EC. Among animal welfare provisions, Article 3 prohibits the tethering of sows or gilt (female pig after puberty and before farrowing). The ban of individual sow stalls was decided in 2001, and a phase-out period of 12 years was allowed to adapt to the new systems. From 1 January 2013, sows must be kept in groups rather than in individual stalls. However, stalls may still be used for the first 28 days of gestation, and one week before the expected time of birth (Article 3.4).\n\nArticle 8 mandates inspections of pigs’ rearing conditions and Article 12 provides that Member States may apply, within their territories, stricter provisions for the protection of pigs than the ones laid down in this Directive.\n\nChapter I of the Annex of the Directive provides that ‘all procedures intended as an intervention carried out for other than therapeutic or diagnostic purposes or for the identification of the pigs in accordance with relevant legislation and resulting in damage to or the loss of a sensitive part of the body, or the alteration of bone structure, shall be prohibited’. However, there are exemptions to this general prohibitions for:\n\n- teeth grinding or clipping (before 7 days old)\n\n- tail-docking\n\n- castration of male pigs by other means than tearing of tissues\n\n- nose-ripping only when the animals are kept in outdoor husbandry systems and in compliance with national legislation.\n\nTail-docking and teeth grinding/clipping must not be carried out routinely, ‘but only where there is evidence that injuries to sows’ teats or to other pigs’ ears or tails have occurred’. There is no requirement to use anaesthetic for castration, except if the procedure is carried out after the 7th day of life.\n\nChapter II mandates that no piglets shall be weaned from the sow at less than 28 days of age, though piglets may be weaned up to seven days earlier if they are moved into ‘specialised housings’.\n\nIn France, Decree of 16 January 2003 lays down minimum standards for the protection of pigs (implementing in Council Directive 2008/120/EC).\n\nRearing – broiler chickens\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for broiler chickens are laid out in Council Directive 2007/43/EC. Notably, Article 3.2 requires that the maximum stocking density is 33kg/m2. However, Article 3.3 allows for derogation to this general rule: a derogation to allow an increase above 33kg/m2 up to 39kg/m2 can be given when additional documented details for each house are kept and the house achieves certain climatic parameters. In addition, the documentation accompanying the flock at the slaughterhouse shall include the daily mortality rate and the cumulative daily mortality rate. A further increase above 39kg/m2 up to 42kg/m2 is allowed where, in addition to the conditions mentioned in the previous point being met, monitoring by the authorities confirms records of low mortality rates and good management practices.\n\nArticle 4.2 requires that the training courses for people dealing with chickens focus on ‘welfare aspects’. Article 7 requires inspections to be carried out.\n\nAnnex I to this Directive provides detailed conditions with regards to the drinkers, feeding, litter, ventilation, heating, noise and light requirements. Annex I also mandates that inspections shall be carried out twice a day. Similar to the wording of the Council Directive 2008/120/EC for pigs, all surgical interventions ‘carried out for reasons other than therapeutic or diagnostic purposes which result in damage to or the loss of a sensitive part of the body or the alteration of bone structure shall be prohibited’. However, two exemptions exist to this prohibition:\n\n- beak trimming, which may be carried out when other measures to prevent feather pecking and cannibalism are exhausted. Beak trimming shall be carried out by qualified staff on chickens that are less than 10-days-old.\n\n- castration of chickens, which shall only be carried out under veterinary supervision by personnel who have received a specific training.\n\nIn France, Decree of 28 June 2010 lays down minimum standards for the protection of broiler chickens (implementing in Council Directive 2007/43/EC). This Decree transposes Council Directive 2007/43/EC, and notably authorises the same maximum stocking density of 42 kg/m2. The Ministry of Agriculture has also created a sheet summarising the legislation in place for broiler producers, and using the OIE definition of animal welfare.\n\nIn January 2020, France pledged to outlaw the culling of unwanted male chicks by the end of 2021.\n\nRearing – egg-laying hens\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for egg-laying hens are laid out in Council Directive 1999/74/EC. Non-enriched cage systems have been prohibited since 1 January 2012 (Article 5.2). Two cage systems are now in use:\n\nenriched cages where laying hens have at least 750 cm² of cage area per hen\n\nalternative systems where the stocking density does not exceed nine egg-laying hens per m² usable area, with at least one nest for every seven hens and adequate perches.\n\nIn both systems, all hens must have a nest, perching space, litter to allow pecking and scratching and unrestricted access to a feed trough.\n\nArticle 8 mandates inspections of the systems of rearing for egg-laying hens.\n\nThe Annex to the Directive specifies that all hens must be inspected by the owner or the person responsible for the hens at least once a day (Article 1). Sound level must be minimised (Article 2) and light levels shall allow hens to show ‘normal levels of activity’. Article 8 prohibits all mutilations except beak trimming, provided it is carried out on egg-laying hens less than 10 days old.\n\nIn France, Decree of 1 February 2002 lays out minimum standards for the protection of laying hens (implementing Council Directive 1999/74/EC).\n\nIn 2018, President Emmanuel Macron pledged that, by 2022, all eggs should be from laying hens raised in free range conditions, thus banning the use of all cages. On 2 October 2018, the Law for the balance of agricultural trade relations and healthy and sustainable food was adopted. Article 68 modifies Article L.214-11 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, which prohibits putting into use any new or refurbished building for raising laying hens reared in cages. However, it is reported that a draft Decree would allow the putting into use any refurbished buildings using egg-laying hens reared in cages, as long as their overall productivity is not increased. Thus, a farm that wishes, without increasing its production capacity, to replace its cages with entirely new cages, could do so. At the time of writing, such a Decree has not been passed.\n\nIn January 2020, France pledged to outlaw the culling of unwanted male chicks by the end of 2021.\n\nRearing – dairy cattle and calves\n\nThere is no EU legislation dedicated to dairy cattle.\n\nCouncil Directive 2008/119/EC lays out the minimum standards for the protection of calves. Article 3 prohibits the use of confined individual pens after the age of eight weeks, except if required by a veterinarian. Individual pens must have perforated walls, allowing the calves to have direct visual and tactile contact. Article 3 further sets out minimum dimensions for individual pens and for calves kept in group. Inspections of facilities should be carried out (Article 7). Annex I of the Directive lays down specific conditions for the rearing of calves. Notably, calves must not be kept permanently in darkness. Member States make provisions for ‘appropriate natural or artificial lighting’. Moreover, all housed calves must be inspected by the owner or the person responsible for the animals at least twice daily and calves kept outside must be inspected at least once daily. The accommodation for calves must allow them to lie down, rest, stand up and groom for themselves without difficulty. Importantly, calves must not be tethered, with the exception of group-housed calves that may be tethered for periods of not more than one hour at the time of feeding milk or milk substitute.\n\nIn France, Decree of 20 January 1994 lays down minimum standards for the protection of calves and has been amended to implement Council Directive 2009/119/EC. This Decree establishes the minimum standards relating to the protection of calves kept for breeding and fattening, and applies to calves under the age of six months and which are not kept with their mother for suckling. Article 3 sets the standards relating to accommodation in groups, individually or in stalls. An annex, made up of 13 articles, contains the general provisions relating to the conditions of calf rearing. The Decree falls short of specifying standards for dairy cattle or prohibiting zero-grazing systems for dairy cattle and calves.\n\nTransport\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for animal transport are laid out in Council Directive EC 1/2005. This Directive defines the responsibilities of all actors involved in the transport chain of live animals entering or leaving the EU. Article 3 (General Conditions) provides that ‘no person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way likely to cause injury or undue suffering to them’. Article 7 forbids long journeys (i.e. exceeding 8 hours) unless the means of transport has been inspected and approved under Article 18(1).\n\nChapter IV, Section 4 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code is dedicated to live animal transport. Article L.214-12 implements Council Directive EC 1/2005 with regards to animal transport, and anyone involved in transporting animals for profit must be authorised by the Departmental Veterinary Services. Training of staff involved with the transport of animals is overseen by the Directorate General of Education and Research of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The police have oversight of control of documents concerning animal transport, for example relating to stocking density. Furthermore, The Ministry of Agriculture’s website emphasises that the live animal transport is strictly regulated, especially in case of heat wave.\n\nSlaughter\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for animals at the time of slaughter are laid out in Council Directive EC No 1099/2009. Article 3 states that animals shall be spared any ‘avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations’. Article 4 mandates that animals must be stunned prior to being slaughtered, and the loss of consciousness and sensibility shall be maintained until the death of the animal. Article 5 specifies that workers should check whether animals do not present any signs of consciousness in the period between the end of the stunning process and death. Annex I to this Directive lists all the stunning methods possible. Annex II sets out the requirements regarding the layout, construction and equipment of slaughterhouses.\n\nIn 2018, following a favourable opinion of the European Food Safety Authority on low atmospheric pressure system for the stunning of broiler chickens, Annexes I and II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 have been amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/723 to approve the stunning of broiler chickens through asphyxia due to low atmospheric pressure.\n\nCouncil Directive EC No 1099/2009 is implemented in French legislation through Articles R214-63 to R214-81 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code and through Decree of 12 December 1997 relating to the procedures for immobilising, stunning and killing animals and the conditions for animal protection in slaughterhouses. Article R214-70 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code lays out that stunning is mandatory except for 1/ ritual slaughter; 2/ killing of farmed game when the process used, which must be previously authorised, results in immediate death; and 3/ emergency killing. Religious slaughter must be carried out in a slaughterhouse by those authorised by a religious authority (Article R214-73), with the cattle and sheep being immobilised via a mechanical process (Article R214-74). Decree of 28 December 2011 lays out conditions that slaughterhouses must fulfil in order to be authorised to carry out slaughter operations without stunning, as well as the procedures for obtaining this authorisation. The Ministry of Agriculture has also created various sheets summarising recommendations for ritual slaughters.\n\nFollowing the release of undercover footages showing cruelty acts committed in slaughterhouses by the animal welfare organisation L214, a law was proposed in November 2016 to ensure the respect of animals at slaughter. The initial proposal included five key measures, namely:\n\n1. The creation of a National Ethics Committee in slaughterhouses, comprised of professionals working in the agricultural sector, veterinarians, sociologists, legal experts, philosophers, parliamentarians, researchers focusing on animal welfare, representatives from farms, animal protection organisations, consumer associations and religious organisations.\n\n2. The creation of a local committee in charge of checking that legal requirements are met for each slaughter facility. This local committee would include local politicians, slaughterhouse owners, farmers, veterinary services, butchers, animal protection organisations, consumer associations and religious representatives.\n\n3. For slaughterhouses with more than 50 staff members, the permanent presence of veterinary services would be required at the stunning and slaughter stages. For facilities employing less than 50 people, the presence of veterinary services should be strengthened.\n\n4. Cameras would be required in all slaughterhouse facilities. It is made clear that if this proposal benefits from ‘a strong support’ from French citizens, such cameras should not be used as a video surveillance tool against staff members.\n\n5. Parliamentarians should be authorised to conduct unexpected visits to slaughterhouses facilities, possibly with registered journalists.\n\nIn its first lecture in December 2016, the law was adopted but the key Article 4, requiring cameras in slaughterhouses, was deleted from the text. In a second lecture on 12 January 2017, the law was eventually adopted by the French National Assembly, gathering only 5% of its Parliamentarians. Importantly, proposal 4 related to mandatory cameras in slaughterhouses was approved (28 votes for and 4 votes against). However, this proposal will not translate fully in practice. As a consequence, however, proposal 3 was taken off the text since the Minister Stephane Le Foll explained that the permanent presence of veterinary services is not needed if cameras are already in place. Unfortunately, this law was again debated in May 2018, to be included in a broader law related to Agriculture and Food. The amendment that was eventually approved is very different than the initial mandatory video criterion. The final version of the law stipulates that in the six months following the official promulgation of the law, slaughterhouses will be given the opportunity, on a voluntary basis, to install cameras in their facilities for a period of two years. A report will be published in 2020 to assess the usefulness of such cameras.\n\nThis amended version of the law on respecting animals at slaughter is now included in a broader, new legislation on Agriculture and Food (Law ‘EGalim’), voted by Parliament on 2 October 2018 and promulgated on 1 November 2018. This law contains a pillar on ‘strengthening animal welfare’ which includes:\n\n- several provisions to increase sanctions in case of maltreatment of animals;\n\n- the capacity for animal protection organisation to file a lawsuit in case of maltreatment of animals;\n\n- the designation of a person responsible for animal protection in each slaughterhouse, with the designated capacity to be the first one signalling a problem;\n\n- the ‘trial’ of video surveillance in slaughterhouses, taking part on a voluntary basis, as implemented by Decree No. 2019-379 of 26 April 2019;\n\n- a trialling period for using mobile slaughter facilities, as implemented by Decree No. 2019-324 of 15 April 2019;\n\n- the interdiction of building or converting a building for the production of eggs from hens reared in battery cages.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe wording of Council Directive 98/58/EC is quite general and does not consider species-specific needs, by comparison to the other Directives.\n\nWith regards to pigs, it is positive that the ban on sow stalls has entered into force since 2013. However, this ban is limited as stalls are still allowed to be use for the first 28 days of gestations, and shortly before giving birth.\n\nThe many exemptions provided in Chapter I of the Annex of Council Directive 2008/120/EC allows for piglet mutilations to be performed without anaesthetics. The use of anaesthetic is only mandated for castration, occurring on a piglet at least 7-days-old. Piglet mutilations are extremely cruel, and these exemptions represent a legal loophole allowing for the inhumane treatment of farm animals.\n\nCastration is practiced the development of undesirable sexual or aggressive behaviour, and to avoid the development of ‘boar taint, which gives pork meat a distinctive taste and odour. The European Commission acknowledges on its website that castration has become ‘a significant animal welfare concern in recent years’, inflicting pain ‘even on very young pigs’. A working group, made of representatives of European farmers, meat industry, retailers, scientists, veterinarians and animal welfare NGOs, met in 2010 and developed the European Declaration on Alternatives to Surgical Castration of Pigs. Two key decisions were taken through this Declaration: the surgical castration of pigs, if carried out, shall be performed with prolonged analgesia and/or anaesthesia with methods mutually recognised. Secondly, the surgical castration of pigs should be abandoned by 1 January 2018. Over 30 stakeholders (animal welfare NGOs, industry practitioners etc.) signed this voluntary agreement.\n\nWith regards to broiler chickens, Council Directive 2007/43/EC represents the first legal instrument in which ‘welfare indicators’ were included as a means of scientific assessment. It is positive that the Directive goes into details about the environment of rearing of chickens (i.e. drinkers, feeding, litter, ventilation and heating, noise, light requirements). The Directive also provides a maximum stocking density, however, by allowing derogations to be made, the Directive enables large-scale, industrial farming practices to be developed in the EU. In such crowded conditions, the Five Freedoms of broiler chickens cannot be fulfilled. In addition, the exemptions for beak trimming and chicken castration enables this practice to be carried out without anaesthetics.\n\nWith regards to egg-laying hens, the 2012 ban on the use of battery cage systems was an important step to improve the welfare of egg-laying hens. By comparison to battery cages, enriched cages provide 20% more space to each hen (the equivalent of an A4 paper with a postcard). Enriched cages have nest boxes, litter, perch space and some scratching materials, and house up to 10 hens. Though the current two systems in use (enriched cages and alternative systems) represent incremental improvements to the life of hens, the EU still allows for hens to be raised in cages. When reared in cages, the Five Freedoms of egg-laying hens are necessarily compromised.\n\nIn September 2018, a European Citizen Initiative (ECI) entitled ‘End the Cage Age’ was launched, supported by a coalition of animal welfare NGOs, among which World Animal Protection. The ECI invites the European Commission to propose legislation to prohibit the use of:\n\ncages for laying hens, rabbits, pullets, broiler breeders, layer breeders, quail, ducks and geese;\n\nfarrowing crates for sows;\n\nsow stalls, where not already prohibited\n\nindividual calf pens, where not already prohibited\n\nSince September 2019, as over 1 million verified signatures have been collected from EU citizens, the European Commission will be invited to propose the above-mentioned legislation.\n\nWith regards to dairy cattle and calves, it is regrettable that there is no EU legislation protecting the welfare-specific needs of dairy cattle. It is positive that calves must not be tethered, though this should be a full ban. Moreover, EU legislation allows for the isolation of calves under eight weeks old. The isolation of calves is detrimental to their welfare, and the provision that calves in isolation need to be able to see other calves is not sufficient to satisfy their need for social interactions.\n\nWith regards to animal transport, it is positive that the Council Directive EC 1/2005 recognises in its preamble that, ‘for reasons of animal welfare the transport of animals over long journeys, including animals for slaughter, should be limited as far as possible’. However, the exception of Article 7, allowing the transport of animals for over 8 hours, is detrimental to animal welfare. In fact, long live animal transport is known to cause stress. Moreover, many breaches of Council Directive EC 1/2005 have been reported, including the transport of unfit animals, exceeding stocking densities, requirements on feed, water and rest not respected, insufficient headroom and bedding, and too elevated temperatures.\n\nIn 2015, the European Commission launched a three-year Pilot Project aiming at improving animal welfare during transport by developing and disseminating Guides to Good and Best Practice for the transport of the main livestock species. In September 2017, the contractor of the project published five extensive guides to good practices, as well as 17 technical fact sheets on good animal transport practices. This is a positive development, however, a total ban on long live animal transport would grant stronger protection to animals.\n\nWith regards to slaughter, is positive that the Council Directive EC No 1099/2009 mandates stunning prior to slaughter, however, numerous EU countries have exemptions to this requirement, notably due to religious reasons. In 2018, the European Commission has also developed a series of fact sheets outlining how various species should be stunned. This appears to show that the EU Commission is willing to disseminate knowledge and improve animal welfare.\n\nThe undercover videos released by the animal protection organisation L214 in October 2015 of a slaughterhouse in Alès sparked public outcry. Images show horses, sheep, cows, veal calves and pigs being killed in terrible suffering, sometimes still conscious. Following this video, a Commission of Investigation (‘Commission d’enquête’) was created, presided by Parliamentarian Olivier Falorni, in order to shed light on the conditions of slaughter in French slaughterhouses. This type of commission is the ‘the strongest control tool’ at the disposal of Parliament. This Commission organised discussions and open online public consultations, as well as visits to slaughterhouses. The Commission issued a report with 65 proposals on five key themes: change rules, increase transparency, enhance staff training, improve slaughter techniques and upgrade the equipment. To be implemented, some of these proposals required a change in the law, which led to the initial legislative proposal in 2016.\n\nThe voting process of this law has been quite lengthy and confusing, as proven by the fact that the debate for this legislation was re-opened in May 2018. The fact that this law does not constitute a stand-alone legislation but is included in a broader agriculture legislation highlights that animal welfare concerns are only seen through the lens of sustaining animal-based agricultural production. It is also regrettable that this law has been stripped from its key measure of implementing mandatory cameras in slaughterhouses, to eventually be reduced to voluntary participation of slaughterhouses – which was already possible prior to the law, as reminded by Olivier Falorni. It appears clear that the Government is not supportive of this law as former Minister of Agriculture Stéphane Travert stated mandatory cameras are ‘not needed’ in slaughterhouses since, supposedly, videos cannot help determine whether the animal truly suffers. His comment contradicts the regular undercover videos shot by L214 revealing brutal and sometimes illegal slaughter practices.\n\nIn France, secondary legislation in the form of Decrees implement EU legislation with regards to farm animals. For pigs, there is no legislation that mandates the group-housing of sows, bans the use of farrowing crates, and mutilations such as tail docking, teeth resection or castration of piglets. For laying hens, there is no legislation completely banning the use of enriched or colony cages: though this was announced during the electoral campaign of Emmanuel Macron, the now President has not enshrined this within legislation. There is no legislation specifically outlining animal welfare requirements for dairy cattle, and is no legislation banning zero-grazing systems (for dairy cows and calves). There are also no provisions in law that ban long-distance transport (greater than eight hours) or that require animals to be slaughtered as close to the point of rearing as possible. If it is positive that the ‘EGalim’ law doubled the penalties for animal abuse, the law falls short of mandating the use of video surveillance in slaughterhouses, which makes it hard to detect such abuse.\n\nThe status of farm animals in French legislation is now aligned with EU law, as the Civil Code rightly defines them as sentient beings. However, animals are still treated as mere goods in practice, which constitutes de facto a barrier to improving animal welfare. This is illustrated by the legal protection under the umbrella of cultural and gastronomic heritage given to the inhumane practice of force-feeding ducks and geese, and the requirement in French law that force-feeding is used in order to produce foie gras (Article L-654-27-1 Rural and Maritime Fishing Code). In contrast to some countries having banned foie gras on the ground of animal welfare, such as the UK and Austria, France is still not ready to revise its production.\n\nThe 2016-2020 National Strategy on animal welfare is an important step to mainstream farm animal welfare. It is positive that the Ministry acknowledges new societal demands for higher welfare, and by affirming the ethical dimension of animal welfare concerns. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food acknowledges that this Strategy was motivated by economic interest, to make animal-based agricultural production ‘more sustainable’. Government policy is supportive of farming animals for food, considering animal-based foods as a necessity, demonstrated, for example, by legislation requiring every meal produced in public sector schools to contain meat, egg or dairy products. It is also worth highlighting that in December 2018, the supermarket chain Casino alongside three independent organisations recognised for their expertise in animal welfare launched the first animal welfare label of products.\n\nThe most recent Food and Veterinary Office audit to evaluate animal welfare controls in place at slaughter and during related operations was carried out by the European Directorate General for Food and Health Safety in 2015. This audit operation concluded that the situation in France for slaughter is broadly satisfactory with the exception of ritually slaughtered poultry and poultry stunned with an electrical water bath, with parameters below those required by EU legislation. In addition, the report highlights that slaughterhouses’ own control systems are lacking and do not include adequate records showing that the slaughterhouses comply with Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009. The audit report furthermore shows that animals unfit for transport (Regulation (EC) No 1/2005) are frequently transported to slaughterhouses, under the support of veterinary certificates, and no effective actions have been taken to correct this.\n\nThe Food and Veterinary Office also carry out audit in the egg industry, the most recent one being in 2015, during which compliance with animal welfare requirements for laying hens, newly built poultry houses are inspected by the competent authorities. The report shows that only 1% of all houses are subject to an animal welfare inspection each year.\n\nA more recent audit was carried out by the European Directorate General on Health and Safety in 2017 to evaluate the welfare conditions of animals during long-distance transport by road to non-EU countries. The audit report concluded that the current measures ‘do not provide satisfactory assurances’ that live animals exports operate smoothly and that these journeys are correctly planned and carried out in line with animal welfare requirements to prevent causing unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to the animals.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms\n\nThe 1976 European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes does not contain any enforcement mechanism. At the EU level, a Directive requires Member States to achieve a particular result, but it does not devise laws on how to reach these goals. As such, Member States have some leeway to decide on their own legislations which will achieve the intended results. By contrast, a Regulation is a binding legislative act, directly applicable to the entirety of the EU.\n\nBreach of the prohibition in the Penal Code of cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and/or up to a €30,000 fine (Article 521-1).\n\nBreach of the prohibition on abuse in Article L214-3 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code is punishable with a fixed fine (Article L215-12).\n\nThere are also enforcement mechanisms relating to the legislation on rearing, transport and slaughter of farm animals in the corresponding Decrees implementing EU law within French legislation.\n\nDepartmental Directorates of Veterinary Services are tasked with applying the regulatory framework relating to farm animal rearing. They have access to the premises and facilities where animals are kept in order to monitor compliance with the law, conduct regular inspections or investigations of farms and have powers to instigate prosecutions and to remove animals. The Departmental Directorates are responsible for regular monitoring of animal welfare in slaughterhouses.\n\nKey recommendations\n\n• The Government of France is urged to ban the worst forms of confinement for farm animals. In particular, the use of farrowing crates, sow stalls, and cages should be banned. The stocking density of broiler chickens should also be reduced to a maximum of 30 kg/m2 or lower. Surgical operations, such as piglet mutilations and beak trimming for egg-laying hens, should not be performed except under anaesthesia and with analgesics.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to mandate the humane slaughter of all farm animals. Animals should be instantaneously rendered unconscious and insensible to pain and distress prior to slaughter. Today, there is growing consensus amongst religious authorities worldwide that pre-slaughter stunning is compatible with religious principles. Humane halal slaughter allows for the animal to be temporarily rendered unconscious via stunning prior to slaughter, as long as the animal's skull remains intact and the animal would regain consciousness in time should slaughter not occur. Therefore, animals should be unconscious before being bled, and no further processing should occur until irreversible loss of consciousness is confirmed. No animal should be forced to witness other animals being slaughtered as this is inherently distressing.\n\n• Legislation regarding the transport of animals should protect their Five Freedoms. In addition, the Government of France is strongly urged to ban the export of live animals over long distances (i.e. more than eight hours) and replace it with a meat only trade. Long distance transport is inherently cruel as it involves chronic stress for all animals and, for some species and modes of transport, it may involve overpopulation, exhaustion, excess heat or cold, inadequate ventilation and/or access to food and water, leading to disease, pain, injury or death.\n\n• It is positive that the EGalim law, adopted on 2 October 2018, extended the protection from abuse to animals during transport and at slaughter. However, one of the key initial provisions of the law, mandating the use of cameras in slaughterhouses, was eventually rejected. As such, the Government of France is urged to mandate the use of video surveillance in all slaughterhouses.\n\nZoos\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for wild animals kept in zoos are laid out in Council Directive 1999/22/EC. ‘Zoos’ are defined as ‘all permanent establishments where animals of wild species are kept for exhibition to the public for 7 or more days a year’, with the exceptions of circuses, pet shops and any other establishments that Member States deem not to host sufficient animals. Article 3 provides that zoos shall implement conservation measures. Among them, one measure is welfare-oriented since zoos have to accommodate their animals ‘under conditions which aim to satisfy the biological and conservation requirements of the individual species, inter alia, by providing species specific enrichment of the enclosures; and maintaining a high standard of animal husbandry with a developed programme of preventive and curative veterinary care and nutrition.’ Article 4 mandates the licencing and inspections of existing and new zoos. Article 8 lays out that Member States shall determine penalties for a breach of this Directive: such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n\nThe EU Zoos Directive Good Practices (2015), while not legally binding, are aimed at supporting practitioners and Member States in implementing the spirit and requirements of the Council Directive 1999/22/EC. The Directive includes recommendations regarding key aspects of animal health and welfare within the zoo environment such as temperature, enclosure size and furnishings and noise.\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 1/2005 on the transport of animals is also applicable to wild animals, both those living in captivity as well as wild animals living in the wild but susceptible of being transported (e.g. for rehabilitation or reintroduction purposes). Article 3 (General Conditions) provides that ‘no person shall transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way likely to cause injury or undue suffering to them’. Chapter II, Article 1.3 provides that a notice shall be given explaining that the animals are wild, timid and dangerous and containing written instructions about feeding, watering and any special care required. Furthermore, Chapter III Article 1.1 mandates that wild animals shall become acclimatised to the mode of transport prior to the proposed journeys.\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to animals in captivity (Article 521-1).\n\nThe Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, Article L214-1 provides that animals should be kept under conditions compatible with their biological requirements. Article L214-3 prohibits the abuse of tame or captive wild animals and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent suffering. Those Decrees that have been made include a Decree of 25 March 2004 laying down general rules of operation for zoological establishments of a fixed and permanent nature (DEVN0430016A), which incorporates the requirements of European Union Directive 1999/22. The Decree requires zoos to be licenced and to provide for the safety and security of animals and people. Article 10 requires animals to be kept in conditions of a high standard that satisfy their biological and species-specific requirements and permit a wide expression of natural behaviours. Article 11 specifies that social animals must not be isolated, except for sanitary reasons or if they become aggressive. Article 12 specifies that animal welfare and the prevention of abnormal behaviours are ensured through a continuous improvement of the conditions of living of animals – through improving the space and enrichment available, the methods of rearing and the social making of animal groups. Article 15 specifies that learning techniques for animals shall not infringe upon the animal’s wellbeing. Visitors are not allowed to touch non-domestic species except if this intervention does not infringe upon the animal’s wellbeing; such operation must serve ‘educational purposes’.\n\nLicences to keep non-domestic animals, including in zoos, are granted by the Head of the Prefecture of the Department in question. Zoos are required to have two licenses, an operation licence for the establishment and a certificate of competence held by at least one full-time employee. The basis for the granting of licences is the ability of the applicants to comply with the legal requirements and to provide appropriate animal care. Requirements for applications for certificates of competence are outlined in a circular issued by the Ministry of Ecology on 11 April 2008.\n\nArticles L. 413-1 to L. 413-5 of the Environment Code regulate the keeping of wild animals in captivity. The general principles are that establishments must provide for the biological needs of animals, ensure the safety of people, encourage conservation, and promote facility quality and staff expertise. Accommodation provided for animals must be adapted to their biological characteristics and thus meet their physiological needs.\n\nPrivate keeping of wild animals\n\nChapter IV, Section 2 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code defines ‘companion animal’ as ‘any animal owned or intended to be owned by humans for their pleasure’. Order of 11 August 2006 establishes the list of species, breeds or varieties of domestic animals. Appendix 1 lists all the species of companion animals, and this definition also applies to Articles R. 411-5 et R. 413-8 of the Environment Code.\n\nThe private keeping of wild animals is regulated through Order of 10 August 2004 on the operation of animal breeding facilities for non-domestic species – according to this Order, anyone keeping at their home a non-domestic species constitutes an ‘animal breeding facilities’. Breeding is authorised if it is done with a non-commercial purpose and the number of animals is limited. This 2004 order was repealed by the Order of 8 October 2018 laying down general rules for keeping animals of non-domestic species. Article 1 establishes that anyone who owns non-domestic species must:\n\n- have a place of accommodation, facilities and equipment designed to guarantee the well-being of animals housed, in order to meet their physiological and behavioural needs;\n\n- have the skills required and adapted to the species and number of animals so that they are kept in good health and maintenance;\n\n- prevent risks relating to the animal’s security and to the security and peace of third parties;\n\n- prevent the introduction of animals into the natural environment and the transmission of human or animal pathologies.\n\nOwners must keep a registry of their animals (Article 8).\n\nFur farming\n\nAt the EU level, a ban on cat and dog fur was introduced by Regulation No 1523/2007, and has entered into force on 31 December 2008. The Regulation bans the placing on the market and the import to or export from the Union of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.\n\nIn April 2019, a Bill No. 1896 was laid out, proposing to ban mink fur production and the sale of mink fur. At the time of writing, this Bill has not been adopted.\n\nAnalysis\n\nCouncil Directive 1999/22/EC provides general provisions for animals kept in zoos. Following the wording of Article 3, zoos are primarily intended to achieve conservation efforts, taking into account animal welfare. It is positive that zoos must be licenced to operate, and that such a licence can only be obtained if criteria of Article 3 are met, which includes welfare provisions relating to enrichment, husbandry, veterinary care and nutrition. Enrichment must be species-specific, but there is no mention of the psychological distress that is induced by constraining animals in enclosures. This Directive could be improved by focusing on the mental wellbeing of animals, rather than on satisfying their basic needs (e.g. nutrition requirements). In particular, a provision could be made to ensure that the size of enclosure is large enough to enable individuals to express normal behaviours, as well as allowing social interactions. Moreover, the frequency of inspections is not mandated in this Directive.\n\nIt is positive that Council Directive (EC) 1/2005 is not limited to livestock, but also covers the transport of wild animals. However, the welfare provisions in this Directive are quite general. For instance, Chapter III, Article 1.1 does not specify how wild animals shall become ‘acclimatised’ to the mode of transport of the proposed journey.\n\nAny ban on fur farming is a positive step for animals, as the fur farming industry is inherently cruel, and fur cannot be produced without causing large amount of pain, distress and suffering to animals. It is thus positive that the EU has implemented a ban on fur farming, though this ban appears very much limited since it covers only two species. The most common species farmed for their fur in Europe – rabbits, minks, foxes – are not included in this ban. Furthermore, there is no legislation at the EU level mandating humane slaughter for animals farmed for their fur.\n\nWith regards to animals kept in zoos, it is positive that zoos must receive a licence to operate, and that zoos must be inspected. The welfare of captive animals appears to have informed various Articles of Decree of 25 March 2004 laying down general rules of operation for zoological establishments of a fixed and permanent nature. However, this Decree does not lay out species-specific provisions nor guidance on environmental enrichment. The legislation falls short of using the Five Freedoms as a guiding principle. Furthermore, direct interaction between the public and wild animals are allowed if these serve an ‘educational purpose’: this vague wording does not provide a detailed definition as to what activities are regarded as educational.\n\nFrance was part of an assessment of European Union zoos carried out in 2011 to evaluate the level of implementation and enforcement of the European Union Directive 1999/22. The country report on France noted a number of serious concerns. The Ministry of Ecology states that it applies its licensing and inspection procedures to 300 establishments that it defines as zoos. However, as at 2011 there were a reported 943 zoos in France. The report therefore recommended that the government ensure that all permanent establishments that are open for seven days or more in a year, and that display any number of non-domestic animal species to the public, are licenced and receive regular inspections, and meet the specified requirements of Decree 25/03/2004 and the Environment Code.\n\nFurthermore, the private keeping of wild animals is largely authorised in France. Though Decree of 8 October 2018 mandates that anyone who owns in their private home a wild animal must have facilities and equipment designed to guarantee the welfare of the animals, this measure appears weak since there is no precise, species-specific definition as to what such facilities should be. French legislation fails to recognise that many wild animals cannot thrive in captivity, even less so in private homes.\n\nIn addition, it is regrettable that France allows the exploitation of animals for the production of fur. Fur farming is inherently cruel and causes pain, distress and suffering to animals. In addition, several luxury brands have now adopted a no-fur policy, hence this could hopefully be used as an economic incentive for France to outlaw fur farms.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms\n\nBreach of the prohibition in the Penal Code of cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and/or up to a €30,000 fine (Article 521-1).\n\nBreach of the prohibition on abuse in Article L214-3 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code is punishable with a fixed fine (Article L215-12).\n\nThe legislation specifies that zoos must be inspected on a regular basis to ensure compliance with regulations. With regards to the private keeping of wild animals,\n\nThe website of the Ministry of Ecology gives information on the type of controls that are carried out. However, it appears that enforcement provisions do not relate to all establishments keeping wild animals in captivity, as the Ministry of Ecology advises it inspects 300 of the estimated 943 zoos in France.\n\nKey recommendations\n\n• The Government of France is urged to remove the provision in Decree of 25 March 2004 allowing direct contact between members of the public and wild animals kept in zoos.\n\n• The Government of France is strongly encouraged to enact further detailed, species-specific legislation mandating environmental enrichment for animals housed in zoos.\n\n• At present, the private keeping of wild animals as companion animals is authorised through a permit system. The Government of France is encouraged to develop a Positive List of species, specifying which animals can be kept as companion animals, based on clear criteria including animal welfare and other relevant concerns.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to fully ban fur farming. Fur farming is inherently cruel and causes pain, distress and suffering to animals.\n\nCare of companion animals\n\nThe European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals is a treaty of the Council of Europe to companion animals and ensure minimum protection standards. Signed in 1987, the treaty entered into force in 1992 and is now open to countries outside members from the Council of Europe. As of March 2019, the Convention has been ratified by 24 countries including France.\n\nArticle 1 prohibits anyone from causing unnecessary pain, suffering or distress, or to abandon a companion animal. Article 2 creates a duty of care onto animal owners, responsible for their health and welfare. Article 10 forbids surgical procedures for the purpose of modifying the appearance of a companion animal, or for other non-curative purposes. In particular, the docking of tails, the cropping of ears, devocalisation, declawing and defanging are prohibited. Exceptions exist if a veterinarian considers non-curative procedures necessary or to prevent the reproduction of animals. Article 11 specifies that the killing of companion animals shall be done with the minimum of physical and mental suffering appropriate to the circumstances.\n\nChapter III contains Supplementary Measures for Stray Animals. Article 12 mandates that the capture of stray animals must be done with the least amount of suffering possible. Once captured, animals may be kept or killed ‘in accordance with the principles laid down in this Convention’.\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to companion animals. Article 521-1 of the Penal Code makes it an offence to seriously physically abuse or sexually abuse, to commit an act of cruelty to, or to abandon a domesticated animal.\n\nUnder Article R214-21 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, it is illegal to carry out surgical procedures on animals for cosmetic purposes. However, tail docking is exempted. Article L214-3 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code prohibits the abuse of domestic animals and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent animal suffering.\n\nAs an example of these Decrees, Decree of 25 October 1982 sets minimum requirements for the breeding and keeping of companion and other animals. This Decree is in accordance with Article 214-1 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, which requires animals to be placed by their owners in conditions that are compatible with their biological needs. For companion animals, the Decree requires them to have access to food and water, sufficient space to move and to stand up, protection from extremes of hot and cold, a clean sheltered area and to be maintained in a good state of health. Dogs kept in kennels must have a minimum area of five square metres and a minimum height of two metres, and excrement must be removed daily. Permanently leashed dogs must have a chain proportionate to their size and strength that permits them to stand up, lie down and to move freely. Animals must not be left in cars unless they are protected from heat and have sufficient air. The Decree permits pet shops to display pets in their windows provided measures have been taken to protect the animals from the sun, excessive hot, cold or light levels ensuring that sufficient air is available.\n\nUnder Article 214-6 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, professional breeders of dogs and cats are subject to inspection and must register with the Departmental Directorate of Veterinary Services. The law requires at least one person in direct contact with the animals to have a certificate of competence attesting to his knowledge of the species concerned including biological, physiological and behavioural needs. Establishments with more than nine dogs over four months of age are subject to rules governing classified facilities and must have be licenced to operate.\n\nA decree was added in 2014 detailing sanitary and animal welfare requirements which must be met by any facility displaying, selling or providing a shelter to animals. Animal welfare standards are chosen according to the biological and behavioural needs of each species. This decree officially came into force on 1 January 2015. Another decree adopted in December 2014 publishes an official list of facilities allowed to provide training to professionals working with animals.\n\nUnder Article 214-8 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, the purchaser of a pet must be provided at the time of delivery by the seller with a certificate of disposal, background information on the characteristics and needs of the animal and a veterinary certificate. Roadside sales or transfers of pets are prohibited.\n\nLaw No. 2008-582 of 20 June 2008 relates to dogs who are considered ‘dangerous’. Dogs likely to be dangerous are classified into two categories according to their morphological characteristics (Article L211-12 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code). Category 1 include American Staffordshire terrier type dogs (formerly Staffordshire terrier), also called ‘pit bulls’; Mastiff type dogs, also called ‘boerbulls’ and Tosa type dogs. Any acquisition, transfer for consideration or free of charge, introduction or import into French territory is prohibited and liable to six months' imprisonment and a fine of €15,000, according to Article L215-2 of the Rural and the Maritime Fishing Code. Category 2 includes is made up of three breeds (listed in a genealogical book recognised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and one type, namely: American Staffordshire terrier dogs, Rottweiler dogs and Tosa.\n\nIn addition, the 2016-2020 Strategy on Animal Welfare decided by the Government includes companion animals. The Government promises stricter regulation of the pet trade, so that any person intending to sell cats and/or dogs would be required to register prior to starting any sale activity. Each seller will be attributed a unique registration number, in order to increase the traceability of the pet traded. This is also intended to help authorities spot any illegal or undeclared breeding and/or selling facility, which may not ensure suitable animal welfare standards. Furthermore, the Government states that a study is needed to regulate events during which companion animals are gathered (e.g. exhibitions) to ensure animals are not harmed.\n\nStray animals\n\nThe 6 January 1999 Law 99-5 relating to dangerous and stray animals and animal welfare makes Mayors responsible for ensuring that there are facilities for stray animals and procedures for collecting such animals. Mayors are also required to institute measures to prevent stray dogs and cats by requiring dogs in the town to be leashed and muzzled (Article 213 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code). Each municipality must have a pound able to house stray animals. If the animals have not been taken back by their owner after eight days, then they are considered abandoned and thus become the property of the pound, which may decide to euthanise the animal, if a veterinarian considers such a procedure necessary. If the pound has been officially declared with a case of rabies, animals are immediately euthanised if their owner does not claim his/her animal back within eight days. Under Law No. 2008-852 of 20 June 2008, all dog bites must be reported to town mayors, and the owner of the dog must take their animal to a veterinarian for a health and behaviour check.\n\nLaw 99-5 modifies Article L211 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, which lays out that if an animal is likely to present a danger for other companion animals or humans, the Mayor may require from the animal owner to take measure to reduce the risk of aggression. If not done, the Mayor may place the animal in a shelter. If, after eight days, the animal owner does not show that he/she will limit the risk posed by his/her animal, then the shelter may authorise the euthanasia of the animal, following veterinary advice.\n\nDecree No. 2002-1381 lays out specific measures with regards to stray animals. For the application of Articles L211-21 and L211-22 of the Rural Code, the Mayor takes all measures likely to allow a fast allocation of responsibility of any stray animal or in state of wandering who would be found accidented, as well as of any animal who would be found wandering or in a state of wandering outside the hours and working days of the pound, or of the structure that it has designated as the place of deposit.\n\nArticle 8 of Decree No. 96-596 of 27 June 1996 relating to the fight against rabies states that the Mayor may, by decree, order the slaughter of animals suspected of rabies in the event that they pose a danger to people, or when local circumstances do not allow the effective and immediate implementation of surveillance measures.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAt the EU level, the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals lays down important principles for the welfare of companion animals, notably by creating a positive duty of care onto animal owners and through prohibiting the abandonment of companion animals. It is also positive that the Convention prohibits surgical procedures on companion animals for appearance purposes.\n\nHowever, the Convention does not provide as strong protections for the welfare of stray animals. In fact, the Convention authorises the killing of stray animals, instead of mandating their rehoming or placing them in a non-kill shelter.\n\nIt is positive that the Penal Code prohibits the abandonment of companion animals, and that Decree of 25 October 1982 establishes a duty of care onto animal owners. Furthermore, the Government has invested time and resources in promoting responsible pet ownership and raising awareness of the needs of companion animals, for example, via the publication “Living with a companion animal”, which is available from veterinary practices, breeders, animal shelters, municipalities and other organisations according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food’s website since 2009. The key laws mentioned are the basic anti-cruelty and neglect laws in Article L-214 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code. Other legislation highlighted in the booklet to prospective or actual pet owners encompasses issues concerning the ownership and control of dangerous dogs (Articles R623-3 and 221-6-2 of the Penal Code) and requirements for all dogs and cats to be registered and identified (Article 215-15).\n\nThe Union of Petfood Makers (Federation des Fabricants d’Aliments pour Chiens, Chats, Oiseaux et Autres Animaux Familiers) estimates that 49.5% of French homes have at least one companion animals, and 42% have at least a cat or a dog. In 2002, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry published a booklet on the welfare of animals introduced with a charter of fundamental principles for the relationship between humans and animals that included the statement that animals have a right to respect and that society must safeguard the welfare of animals that it uses. However, these principles do not themselves have any legislative status. In 2015, the Ministry of Agriculture and the NGO National Council of Animal Protection (CNPA) jointly produced a two-part leaflet on ‘living with a cat or a dog’. This leaflet reminds potential owners of the regulation surrounding the sale of companion animals and the owners’ responsibility vis-à-vis their animals (e.g. education, vaccination etc.).\n\nAddressing cruelty to pets appears to be a mainstream concern of much of society in France, with cases involving extreme cruelty attracting widespread media coverage and public outcry. However, animal protection organisations report that it is only the most extreme cases of cruelty that are investigated and prosecuted and sometimes only after long delays. For example, in one 2011 case involving the confiscation of 46 dogs from breeders, the animal protection organisation One Voice had a dossier of concerns raised with enforcement authorities dating back to 1999.\n\nLaw No. 2008-582 has negative effects on animals, since it can lead to the euthanasia of dogs considered ‘dangerous’ if the animal owner is unable to present the required permit for the dog, following a one-month delay (Article 5).\n\nRegarding stray animals, it is regrettable that French legislation allows for the culling of animals suffering from rabies through Article 8 of Decree No. 96-596, since culling has been scientifically proven to be inefficient, by comparison to humane population control measures.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms\n\nThe European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals does not contain any enforcement mechanisms.\n\nBreach of the prohibition in the Penal Code of cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and/or up to a €30,000 fine (Article 521-1).\n\nBreach of the prohibition on abuse in Article L214-3, the rule on breeders in Article L214-6 and the rule on sale of pets in Article L214-8 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code is punishable with a fixed fine (Article L215-12).\n\nKey recommendations\n\n• The Government of France is urged to amend Article R214-21 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, in order to fully ban cosmetic mutilations, including tail docking.\n\n• The Government of France is strongly encouraged to promote humane dog population management, which relies on promoting responsible ownership, mass dog vaccinations and reproduction control programmes. Culling is unnecessary, cruel and has been scientifically proven to be ineffective. At present, Decree No. 96-596 allows for animals ‘suspected’ of rabies to be slaughtered. The Government of France should also implement education programmes on dog bite prevention.\n\n• The Government of France is strongly encouraged to repeal Law No. 2008-582 prohibiting the ownership of dogs considered dangerous (based on morphology and breed). Instead of banning the keeping of these dogs, which results in the dogs being euthanised, the Government of France should encourage the adoption of such dogs and more public education on responsible pet ownership. The Government of France should overall promote responsible pet ownership, including the adoption of companion animals over the purchase of commercially bred animals.\n\nAnimals used for entertainment\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to animals used for entertainment (Article 521-1).\n\nUnder the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, Article L214-3 prohibits the abuse of domestic animals and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent suffering. Those Decrees that have been made include general minimum requirements relating to the keeping of animals in the Decree of 25 October 1982 on the rearing and keeping of animals. This includes domestic equines. Requirements include maintaining animals in a state of good health, avoiding unnecessary suffering, not keeping animals in the dark or in permanent light and providing sufficient water and food.\n\nUnder the Environment Code, wild animals kept in captivity must be provided with conditions that are adapted to their biological characteristics and thus meet their physiological needs (Articles L.413-1 to L.413-5).\n\nDog fighting is prohibited under the basic anti-cruelty provision in Article 521-1 of the Penal Code. However, certain activities are exempted from the anti-cruelty legislation; namely bullfighting where an uninterrupted local tradition can be invoked, and cockfighting in localities where an uninterrupted tradition can be established. The term ‘uninterrupted local tradition’ has been left to individual courts to define. The word ‘invoked’ refers to a fact and the word ‘established’ refers to the interest of the public. The Court of Appeal in Toulouse designated the Pyrenees, Garonne, Provence, Languedoc, French Catalonia, Gascony, Landes and the Basque Country as localities with a strong bullfighting tradition. However, the highest judicial Court of Cassation had a more restrictive interpretation. It is an offence to build a new ‘gallodrome’ (cock fighting arena). In the French mainland, cock fighting is permitted in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and in overseas territories, cock fighting is permitted on the Reunion Island, French Guyana, French Antigua (Martinique and Guadeloupe) and French Polynesia. In 2015, the French High Court upheld the 1964 law that banned the construction of new cockfighting pits and rings throughout the nations and overseas departments, such as Reunion Island, French Guyana and the French Antilles.\n\nIn Mars 2018, two laws proposals related to bullfighting were put forth. The first one requested to simply forbid bullfighting and cockfighting, by deleting the exemptions made for those activities in the Penal Code. Another Bill was proposed to ban bullfighting for children under 14 years-old. This latter proposal followed a recommendation from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child stating that bullfighting shows should be forbidden for underage children. At the time of writing, none of these proposals has been adopted.\n\nDecree of 18 March 2011 (DEVL1108130A) deals with the keeping of non-domestic animals in travelling spectacles such as circuses. This includes a requirement for animals to be kept in conditions that satisfy their biological and behavioural needs in line with the Environment Code, together with provisions requiring that animals have the possibility to exercise outside each day, have sufficient room in any outdoor enclosures to move freely, have a suitable diet and receive veterinary treatment if they are sick or injured. The law also requires an employee responsible for animals in a circus to hold a certificate of competence under Articles 213 -2 and 214- 4 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code. Circuses with non-domesticated animal species must also be authorised by the Prefect of the Department in which they are situated. Animals must not be altered or drugged other than for reasons of their own health. Transport of circus animals must be carried out in accordance with EU Directives concerning animal transport. Circuses must also comply with endangered species legislation. A law was proposed in November 2017, which requested an amendment to Article 521-1 of the Penal Code punishing mistreatment on animals, to include a ban on the use of domestic or wild animals in travelling shows. At the time of writing, this law has not been adopted.\n\nCetaceans have been the subject of a Decree passed on 3 May 2017, which forbade the breeding of orcas and dolphins in captivity, as well as the trade of these species among marine parks. This outcome was notably made possible by various animal protection organisations, for some of them part of the broader network of NGO Dolphinaria-Free Europe. The Decree repealed and replaced the previous 1981 Decree which defined conditions under captivity. This new Decree, announced on 3 May 2017, introduced the following requirements:\n\n1. Increase by at least 150% of the pool size;\n\n2. Interdiction to treat the water with chlorine;\n\n3. Creation of a specialised team of animal carers;\n\n4. Interdiction of direct contact between the public and animals;\n\n5. Stricter controls between dolphins’ reproduction.\n\nHowever, upon official publication on 6 May 2017, the law stated that breeding of both orcas and dolphins would be forbidden.\n\nThree facilities currently have cetaceans in captivity in France: Marineland, the Parc Asterix and Planete Sauvage. Following the announcement by the Minister of the Ecology Segolene Royal that breeding will be forbidden, these facilities appealed the decision to the French State Council. The State Council eventually repealed the ban on breeding for procedural reasons on 29 January 2018. The Council declared that since the ban on breeding constitutes a significant change from the initial Decree, it should have undergone a public consultation. The final legislation forbids captivity of marine mammals except for orcas (Orcinus orca) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncates).\n\nDraught animals\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to animals used for draught (Article 521-1).\n\nUnder the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, Article L214-3 prohibits the abuse of domestic animals and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent suffering. Those Decrees that have been made include general minimum requirements relating to the keeping of animals in the Decree of 25 October 1982 on the rearing and keeping of animals. This includes domestic equines. Requirements include maintaining animals in a state of good health, avoiding unnecessary suffering, not keeping animals in the dark or in permanent light, and providing sufficient water and food.\n\nIn addition, the 2016-2020 Strategy on Animal Welfare refers to domestic equines, who amount to about 200,000 in France. The Government highlights that the use of equines for sports, leisure or draught is particularly prevalent in France. The Strategy affirms that a study shall be conducted among state services, veterinary services and farmers to enhance the dissemination of technical and scientific information related to horses’ welfare, in order to prevent mistreatment. State control agents will increasingly work in collaboration with all actors involved in the equine sector.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDespite the general provisions of the Environment Code mandating that animals kept in captivity must be provided with conditions that are adapted to their biological characteristics and physiological needs, thus taking into account their physical and psychological wellbeing, these provisions tarnished by the legal acceptance of various cruel entertainment practices. Notably, it is regrettable that French legislation authorises culture to be an excuse for animal cruelty, through allowing the bullfighting and cockfighting in certain regions of the country.\n\nAn opinion poll conducted in May 2018 shows that 74% of French people are in favour of banning bullfighting. From that same poll, 80% of French people consider that bullfighting and cockfighting cannot be defined as ‘shows’. Bullfighting has been the subject of numerous and fierce debates in France, with bullfighting organisations on one side, and animal welfare organisations as well as doctors on the other. France has about 12 training schools for toreadors, sometimes accepting children as early as eight years-old. Anti-corridas organisations also point out to the fact that such training schools receive heavy subsidies from cities: this proves the willingness from the Government and local authorities to pursue such cruel practices for animals. The fact that the UN itself recommends banning bullfighting for at least young children, but that France has not yet followed this recommendation, proves that cultural traditions and powerful lobbying organisations prevail over animal welfare concerns. Legal action attempting to overturn the bullfighting exemptions from basic anti-cruelty legislation has failed. The French Constitutional Court found that ‘traditional’ fights held in areas of southern France ‘do not harm people's protected constitutional rights’. Though it is forbidden since 1964 to build new cockfighting pits, this is a positive yet insufficient development for the eradication of this cruel practice.\n\nWith regards to the use of animals in circuses, the existence of travelling circuses using animals is a barrier to improving animal welfare in France as it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to meet the needs of animals that are continually in transit or temporary accommodation. Seeing that many countries in the world and the EU now fully or partially ban the use of wild animals, with legislation having recently passed in European countries – such as Belgium, Ireland, England and the Netherlands – France is clearly lacking behind. There are estimated to over 200 circuses using more than 1,500 animals in France. A 2003 working paper produced by the European Parliament’s Directorate for Research on the situation of the circus in European Union Member States notes that circuses are promoted and supported by the French government. For example, the Department of Theatre and Entertainment of the Ministry of Culture was reported to subsidise 94% of the circus activities in France. The research paper highlighted a report on travelling circuses in France produced by the Ligue Française des Droits de l'Animal or LFDA (French League for Animal Rights), which criticised the conditions in which animals are held because of the total contradiction with their behavioural needs and the practice of ignoring species-specific requirements. For example, the report highlighted that animals such as elephants, hippopotamuses, polar bears and sea-lions require large quantities of water that circuses cannot provide.\n\nIt is encouraging to see that an increasing number of Mayors are refusing to host circuses in their municipalities is these have animals. In fact, over 60 mayors are now refusing to host circuses with wild animals as of November 2017, among whom the mayors of Bagnolet, Fontenay-sous-Bois, Creil and Montreuil. The latest to date was the Mayor of Dunkerque, who announced that travelling circuses with wild animals will no longer be accepted in the city by as of September 2020.\n\nLegislation with regards to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has also been applied to a circus animal in France: a 13-year-old hippopotamus born in France was confiscated in 2007 for being held without necessary CITES documentation. Furthermore, in November 2017, a young female tiger escaped from its enclosure at a circus near Paris and, after wandering for a few minutes, was killed by the owner of the circus. This event added to the public outcry against the use of wild animals in circuses. Though the Paris Council stated it was against the use of wild animals in circuses, it refused to ban circuses with wild animals in the capital city, leaving the capacity to the national Government to legislate on that matter. At the national level, former Environment Minister said he was not in favour of circuses with animals but no law has yet been approved.\n\nIn relation to cetaceans captivity, the repeal of the ban on breeding for orcas and dolphins clearly demonstrates that there are strong economic interests at play for the three facilities displaying orcas and/or dolphins for entertainment purposes. In December 2018, eight animal welfare NGOs met with then Environment Minister François de Rugy to discuss the fate of cetaceans in captivity. The Minister stated he was ‘sensitive’ to animal welfare and wished to advance a new Decree, yet no promise has been done to include a closure or a ban on cetacean breeding in a new Decree.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms\n\nBreach of the prohibition in the Penal Code of cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and/or up to a €30,000 fine (Article 521-1).\n\nBreach of the prohibition on abuse in Article L214-3 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code is punishable with a fixed fine (Article L215-12).\n\nArticle 215-11 of the Rural Code provides for a penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of €7,500 for unnecessary bad treatment of animals by any person operating a retail, grooming, dressage or public exhibition of pets at a business, shelter or breeding facility. The operator may also incur an additional penalty under part 11 of the Penal Code 131-6.\n\nThere are enforcement mechanisms with respect to certificates of competence.\n\nKey recommendations\n\n• Given that the physiological and behavioural needs of marine mammals cannot be met in captivity, the Government of France is strongly encouraged to ban the breeding, keeping and training of all marine mammals in captivity, so that these animals constitute the last generation in captivity in the country. These animals should be retired to large seaside sanctuaries, which allow for an increased range of natural behaviours.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to forbid the organisation of and attendance to entertainment events causing animal suffering. Such a prohibition should cover circuses, rodeos, animal fights, animal races, rides on wild animals and all other forms of entertainment. Notably, following the initiatives of over 60 Mayors, the Government of France is strongly encouraged to ban the use of all animals in circuses. Phasing out of animals for entertainment purposes could start with a ban on the use of wild animals for such performances.\n\n• The Government of France is urged to remove the cultural exemption for local and cultural traditions, currently enshrined in Article 521-1 of the Penal Code, which allows the cruel bullfighting and cockfighting practices to continue.\n\nAt the EU level, welfare provisions for animals used in scientific research are laid out in Directive 2010/63/EU, which updated and replaced the 1986 Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. This new Directive applies to live vertebrates and live cephalopods (Article 1.4). Article 4 enshrines the Three Rs principles in legislation – Replacement, Reduction, Refinement. Article 6 mandates that animals be killed with minimum ‘pain, suffering, distress’. Articles 7 and 8 provides exemptions for the use of endangered species and non-human primates in experiments, respectively. It is forbidden to take animals from the wild to carry experiments, except when the procedure cannot be achieved using an animal who has been bred for use in procedures. It is furthermore prohibited to use animals stray and feral animals of domestic species in experiments. (Article 11). Article 14 ensures that ‘Member States shall ensure that, unless it is inappropriate, procedures are carried out under general or local anaesthesia, and that analgesia or another appropriate method is used to ensure that pain, suffering and distress are kept to a minimum’.\n\nWith regards to animal testing for cosmetic products, Chapter V, Article 18 of Regulations EC No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2009 on cosmetic products prohibits to test finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals (testing ban). The same article also prohibits marketing finished cosmetic products and ingredients in the EU that were tested on animals (marketing ban). The testing ban on finished cosmetic products applies since 11 September 2004, while the testing ban on ingredients or combination of ingredients applies since 11 March 2009.\n\nThe use of alternative methods in animal experiments when scientific objectives can be achieved without using laboratory animals has been a legal requirement in France since 1976 (Law 76-629).\n\nThe provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting cruelty, abuse and mistreatment of animals apply to animals used for experiments. (Article 521-1).\n\nUnder the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, Article L214-3 prohibits the abuse of domestic and captive animals, and provides that secondary legislation in the form of Decrees will make more precise rules to protect against abuse and prevent suffering. The Article confirms that this applies to scientific experiments and reiterates that these must be limited to strict necessity. Two Decrees have been made following the general provision of Article L214-3 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code: Decree 87-848 of 19 October 1987; and Decree 2013-118 of 1 February 2014.\n\nThere is further detailed regulation in Articles R214-87 to R215-10 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code. The legislation is founded on the Three Rs principles – Replacement, Reduction, Refinement – and has detailed requirements regarding the establishment of ethical committees and the design of projects. The law requires licensing of all projects using animals by the Department of Research. Each facility must appoint a management structure to monitor the well-being of animals, to verify the qualifications of the personnel and to take responsibility for animal care and the design of projects. A veterinarian (or a suitably qualified expert) must be designated to advise on the welfare of animals.\n\nArticle R214-112 of the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code permits the donation of unwanted animals by laboratories to animal protection organisations with the authorisation of the Prefect of the Department concerned, provided that a veterinarian attests there is no danger to public health, animal health and the environment.\n\nDecree 87-848 of 19 October 1987 relating to experimentation on vertebrate sets out licencing and welfare requirements. This Decree modifies Chapter IV, Section 6 of the Rural Code, which is dedicated to the use of animals for experiments. This Decree is applicable to all vertebrates, including mammals in their foetal stage, and live cephalopods. Article R214-95 of the Rural Code lays out various welfare conditions such as housing, food and water access, and care adapted to their health and wellbeing, Any restriction of an animal’s ability to fulfil his/her behavioural and physiological needs must be reduced to a minimum. All animals and their living conditions must be inspected at least once a day. Measures must be taken as soon as possible to end any abnormal behaviour or pain, suffering, anxiety or injury which could be avoided. Article R214-91 of the Rural Code prohibits the use of stray or wild animals for experiments, except when such animals are needed for an experiment critical to the health and wellbeing of animals of the same species; or when there is a serious threat to human, animal or planetary health; or when there is scientific evidence demonstrating that the results of such experiments can only be obtained using a wild or stray animal.\n\nArticle R214-117 lays out that any project that i"
