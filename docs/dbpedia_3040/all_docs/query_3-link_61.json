They do karaoke on some nights and have a breakfast brunch buffet with a mimosa bar on Sundays. The drinks in the machine are a passion fruit Margarita and the chocolate one is a Bushwacker. You probably only need one it's very good ðŸ˜‚\n\nI loved the comfortable atmosphere. Food was amazing! The lady who waited on us was very pleasant and attentive. I observed that they have different events every night. I will be back\n\nFirst time here, we called our order inâ€¦Got the smoked chicken garden salad, pulled pork sandwich & fried Oreos.. from answering the phone to checkout, the customer service was awesome. The food was amazing, my husband seriously hasnâ€™t stopped raving about this place. Highly recommend!\n\nThe staff are amazingly AWESOME! The food is out of this world! We got the chicken quesadilla and the Mac N Cheese croc.... It came with tater tots some homemade Bacon bits your choice of pulled pork or chicken a layer of sharp cheese sprinkled on top and some green onions omg it was SOOO good and of course the drinks were good too!!!"
