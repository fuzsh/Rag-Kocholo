        "text": "Gaulart & Maliclet French Café opened its door during the summer of 1984 in Charleston, SC by artists Gwylene Gallimard & Jean-Marie Mauclet as a tool to build community through food. They remain advisors to the longtime employees that carry on their legacy. The shared tables that bring the height of the customer to the same height of the staff, the open kitchen, the focus on simple, fresh ingredients and our commitment to making fresh soups and specials daily are just as important today as they were when we opened. Charleston continues to expand outward and change demographically but the Café remains a place where people of all walks of life can gather, communicate, and enjoy a home cooked meal and an affordable glass of French Wine!"
