We’ll be sure to remind you if you’re approaching 45 days.\n\nAt this time, we do not have allergen information available for our alcoholic drinks. The Alcohol & Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau (TTB), who regulates alcohol labeling, currently does not require alcohol suppliers to disclose allergen information on its labels. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution and concern for your health, we can’t recommend an alcoholic beverage that would eliminate the potential of consuming a certain allergen.\n\nThe health and safety of our guests are always top priorities. As part of this ongoing commitment, we provide the most current allergen menu information available from our food suppliers on the eight most common allergens including egg, fish, milk, peanut, shellfish, soy, tree-nuts, and wheat/gluten. Every effort is made to keep this information current. However, it is possible that ingredient changes and substitutions may occur due to the differences in regional suppliers, recipe revisions, preparation techniques, and/or the season of the year. Certain menu items may vary from restaurant to restaurant and may not be available at all locations. Limited time offers, test products, or regional items have not been included on these menus.\n\nDuring normal kitchen operations involving shared cooking and preparation areas, the possibility exists for food items to come in contact with other food products. For example, fried items are identified with a ‘•’ under the cross-contact column of the guide because of the use of shared fryers between foods. For this reason, we advise guests with food allergies to avoid all fried foods.\n\nPlease review all allergies on our Chili's allergen guide, which identifies what allergens are present in each dish.\n\nFor our Guests sensitive to gluten we offer a gluten-friendly menu. This menu consists of items prepared without gluten-containing ingredients based on information from our approved suppliers. Chili’s makes no claim that these items meet the definition of gluten-free, defined as containing less than 20 ppm of gluten per FDA standards. Because we have multiple sources of gluten in our kitchen there is risk that gluten cross-contact may occur during the preparation and cooking of these items. Before placing your order please inform the manager of your food allergy and/or sensitivity so we can do everything possible to safely accommodate your dietary needs.\n\nMany of our foods contain soybean oil and our fried items are prepared in 100% soybean oil. However, under FDA regulations highly refined soybean oil is not considered allergenic and is exempt from labeling. Therefore, menu items that contain highly refined soybean oil will not be listed as containing soy on our allergen guide unless other forms of soy protein are present (e.g., hydrolyzed soy, soy flour, miso, edamame). Please check with your doctor to find out whether you should avoid highly refined soybean oil.\n\nAt Chili’s, we use a variety of spices in the preparation of our menu items. Please let us know what menu items are of interest to you and we will provide you with a list of ingredients. Note: FDA labeling laws allow manufacturers to list a spice by either its common name/usual name or it may be listed as ‘spice.’ Because ‘spice’ could include a number of different spices, we caution guests with food allergies to consume these menu items.\n\nOur corporate dietitian has identified which menu items meet our vegetarian and vegan standards. Vegetarian items contain no beef, pork, poultry, fish, shellfish or ingredients derived from animals (e.g., gelatin, chicken broth, animal rennet), but items may contain eggs or milk. Cheeses processed with microbial enzymes (not rennet) are marked as vegetarian. Vegan items contain no animal-derived products. Because we use shared fryers in our restaurants, fried foods are exposed to animal product during the cooking process (e.g., French Fries cooked in same oil as Chicken Crispers). Access a full list of vegetarian and vegan options by viewing our Allergen and Vegetarian/Vegan Guide.\n\nBrinker International’s goal is to Make People Feel Special, and one of the ways we strive to accomplish that is through giving back.
