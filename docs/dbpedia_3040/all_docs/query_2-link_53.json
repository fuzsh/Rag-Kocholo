        "text": "Any structure that marks the passage of the sun throughout the day can be considered a sundial.\n\nAlthough immensely impressive, ancient structures such as Stonehenge in Wiltshire and New Grange in Ireland are not true sundials in the modern sense, as they use the sun to mark the season rather than the hour.\n\nThe oldest true sundial, that we know of, is an Egyptian shadow clock made from green schist and built around 1500BCE in Egypt. Shaped like a letter L the length of the shadow cast by the vertical leg and cross piece along the horizontal leg indicated the time. The base, on which is inscribed a scale of six time divisions, is placed in an east-west direction with the crosspiece at the east end in the morning and at the west end in the afternoon. The length of the shadow on the horizontal leg indicates the time. Sundials of this kind were still used until recently in parts of rural Egypt.\n\nThe day was divided into 12 hours from sunrise to sunset, hence, as the days vary in length throughout the year, the length and position of the arc varied according to the seasons, and an appropriate number of arcs was often inscribed on the internal surface of the hemisphere.\n\nThis obviously resulted in longer hours in the summer and shorter in the winter, what was know as Seasonal Hours.\n\nAristarchus’s sundial was widely used for many centuries and, according to the Mesopotamian astronomer al-Battani (858–929 CE), was still in use in the Arab world until the the 10th century.\n\nThe Babylonian astronomer Berosus (c290 BCE) developed a variation of this sundial by cutting away the part of the spherical surface south of the circular arc traced by the shadow tip on the longest day of the year.\n\nThe medieval Muslims further developed sundials to provide a reliable means of determining the times of prayer. Hence most Muslim sundials contain lines indicating these times, and indeed on some they are the only lines shown.\n\nScratch dials are nearly always near doorways, and were likely home-made by the monks to keep track of prayer times. A thin stick or pencil (or even a finger) would be inserted in the hole, and the resulting shadow indicates the time.\n\nAlthough the Arabs learned the basic principles of sundials from the Greeks, they increased the variety of designs available through their understanding of mathematics, especially trigonometry. It was the Arabs who worked out that the gnomon needed to be parallel to the axis of the earth. At the beginning of the 13th century CE, the Moroccan astronomer Abu al-Hasan al-Marrakushi described many different types of sundial, and is credited with introducing the concept of equal length hours.\n\nThe Romans perfected the horizontal sundials we know today and also invented portable travelling versions. Although we can’t be sure, it seems that the Romans were the first to make sundials purely for fun. This portable sundial discovered in Heracleum (destroyed by Vesuvius at the same time as Pompeii) is made to look like a cured ham! The small bronze ‘lump’ was unearthed in Heracleum in the 18th Century. It was immediately identified as a sundial by the markings, but the gnomon was lost, so it couldn’t be read. Recently however a 3D printed copy has been made with a pig’s tail as the gnomon, and with some experimentation it works perfectly.\n\nThe Romans were also the first to use sundials in gardens. Roman gardens were private spaces, set behind houses and enclosed on all sides by rooms and colonnades. In the midst of this ordered scene was the sundial. Set on a stone pedestal to catch the shadow of the Sun God Sol as he drove his chariot across the sky. I think this is the image of the sundial that most fits in with the modern psyche.\n\nSo carry on the age-old tradition of placing a sundial in a sunny spot. In gardens, sundials will never be out of fashion; set on a stone plinth, a sundial creates a focus for the garden and allows you to watch the hours pass as you spend your time weeding, or dinking your first glass of wine…\n\nWith the advent of mechanical clocks in the early 14th century, sundials with 12 equal hours gradually came into general use in Europe. There have however been attempts to introduce new systems, most notably the French Republican Calendar of 1793 which imposed a decimal timescale with a 10 hour day, each hour divided into 100 minutes, and each minute having 100 seconds. Not surprisingly it wasn’t a success and was abandoned in 1795. Very few decimal sundials were made, and I’m not aware of any still in existence, but here is a rare decimal pocket watch.\n\nThe invention of clocks is often blamed on the demise of sundials, but this isn’t the case. The early clocks just weren’t very accurate and needed to be regularly calibrated by a sundial to bring them back on time. Indeed sundials were in use by the French railways to regulate their mechanical clocks until very recently, with the last stations abandoning their sundials in 1900.\n\nAnd we mustn’t forget that leap days and leap seconds are ways to reconcile the inaccuracy of clocks with solar time.\n\nIt was the telegraph which finally retired the sundial. Once it was possible to broadcast a time signal around the country, or indeed the world, clocks could be kept in time without the sundials’ help.\n\nThe longest lived sundial?\n\nDeep in a mountain in Western Texas is the Long Now Clock. This is a magnificent project to ‘build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium, and every millennium for the next 10,000 years.’\n\nA clock to last 10,000 years!\n\nThis magnificent project will be the most complex and accurate mechanical clock ever built, but even this could become inaccurate over the centuries and millennia. So the designers have incorporated the The Thermal-Difference Device.\n\nThe Thermal-Difference Device involves a Sapphire glass window through which the light of the midday sun will pass, through prisms, onto a series of rods which will expand in the heat and transmit the passing of Solar Midday onto the innards of the clock deep underground, allowing it to re-calibrate itself daily (or when the sun shines).\n\nYet again, a sundial is being used to regulate a clock. And will do for 10,000 years!"
