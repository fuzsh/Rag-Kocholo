        "text": "Taste of Savoie demystifies the cuts of meat in France\n\nFrench meat cuts are somewhat different from their English counterparts but I think I’ve worked them out now, so I thought I’d share my findings. One of the things I love about living in France is that the Boucherie is very much a thriving business in most high streets in towns and villages. As well as the option of buying directly from the farmers and small farm shops. The local Boucher’s stall is normally found at weekly town markets.\n\nFrench meat cuts were a puzzle to me when I arrived in France ten years ago, but I now feel comfortable visiting my Boucher and ordering most cuts of meat. Although there are some British cuts that don’t directly translate as the meat is cut differently.\n\nFrench Meat Cuts\n\nAs I’ve puzzled over the French meat cuts myself and been asked by friends, I thought I’d put together some explanations of the cuts of meat we find in France – and how they may differ from the English cuts.\n\nPork\n\nLes morceaux du porc\n\n01 Échine\n\n02-03 Côte première / côte seconde\n\n04-05 Filet / côte filet\n\n06 Filet mignon\n\n07 Pointe filet\n\n08-09 Jambon et grillade\n\n10 Palette (épaule)\n\n11 Jarret arrière\n\n12 Jarret avant\n\n13-14 Plat de côte / Travers\n\n15 Poitrine\n\nBacon if thinly sliced is poitrine, preserved with salt. The French slice their poitrine fairly thickly to make lardons, so you need to ask for the slices to be ‘fine’ (pronounced ‘feen’).\n\nPoitrine de pork – belly pork\n\nEchine – is between the neck and the first rib above the shoulder – includes the blade bone and spare ribs.\n\nÉpaule is shoulder\n\nPlat de côtes – where the hand and belly meet\n\nFilet de porc – pork tenderloin\n\n• If you want your joint with crackling, this should be no problem for your local butcher, but you may need to order it in advance. Ask for the joint ‘avec la couenne’ (pronounced la ‘quwen’).\n\nJoues – cheeks\n\nJarret – ham hock\n\nPalette – short cut leg of pork\n\nTravers – ribs\n\nPorc Effiloché – pulled pork (slow cooked dry roasted) – normally the shoulder\n\nLamb:\n\nLes morceaux de l’agneau\n\n01 Collier d’agneau\n\n02 Côtes découvertes\n\n03-04 Côtes secondes / Côtes premières\n\n05-06 Filet / Côtes filets\n\n07-08 Selle / Gigot raccourci\n\n09-10 Poitrine/ Haut-de-côtes\n\n11-12 Épaule / Épaule roulée\n\nGigot d’agneau – leg of lamb\n\nEchine – shoulder\n\nCôtes – chump\n\nCollet – scrag (end)\n\nPoitrine/ poitrail – breast\n\nCôtelette – chop usually from the rack of lamb, where the British cutlet comes from\n\nSelle d’agneau – saddle\n\nsouris d’agneau – lamb shank\n\nBeef\n\nLes morceaux du bœuf\n\n01 Collier\n\n02 Basses côtes\n\n03-04 Entrecôte et côte de bœuf\n\n05 Faux-filet\n\n06 Filet de bœuf\n\n07 Rumsteck\n\n08 Queue de bœuf\n\n09-13 Gîte à la noix, rond de gîte\n\n10-11-12 Tende de tranche / Poire / Merlan/Araignée\n\n14-15-16-17 Plat de tranche / Rond de tranche / Mouvant\n\n18 Gîte (Jarret arrière)\n\n19 Aiguillette baronne\n\n20 Onglet de bœuf\n\n21 Hampe de bœuf\n\n22 Bavette d’aloyau\n\n23 Bavette de flanchet\n\n24 Flanchet\n\n25 Plat-de-côtes de bœuf\n\n26-27 Tendron / Milieu de Poitrine\n\n28 Gros bout de Poitrine\n\n29 Macreuse à bifteck\n\n30 Paleron\n\n31 Jumeau à bifteck\n\n32 Macreuse à pot-au-feu\n\n33 Jumeau à pot-au-feu\n\nBifteck/ steak – steak\n\nBavette – undercut – from the skirt, flank steak textured with long muscle fibres\n\nBasses-côtes – Chuck Steak more like Silverside\n\nFilet – fillet\n\nFaux-filet – more like a sirloin\n\nSteak à hacher – used for steak tartare and steak haché. Steak haché looks like a burger, but it is good quality minced steak pressed. It is usually freshly minced, which is why people are happy to eat them rare. Not comparable to a beef hamburger.\n\nRumsteak – rump steak\n\nMerlan/ Araignée – spider steak – heavily marbled stea\n\nOsseline and Onglet – Hanger steak\n\nPaleron and Macreuse – Shoulder – good for braising\n\nPot au Feu – think rib/brisket – for braising\n\nEntrecôte – fore rib steak\n\nTournedos/ filet mignon – tenderloin steak, a chunk of tender steak, usually served quite rare (Saignant) unless otherwise requested. You can get ‘tournedos’ of lamb, too.\n\nOne thing that I found strange when I first visited the local boucherie was that the only meat that they will mince is beef. I was once told lamb couldn’t be mince! (but that may have been my ‘malentendu’ (misunderstanding). I was also told it was interdit! but I believe this was for hygiene and food standard reasons. However having befriended my local boucher he told me that if I ask in advance they will mince other meats but they need notice as they only have one mincer and need to clean it down before using for other meats.\n\nOther beef cuts:\n\nTête de veau – head of veal\n\nLangue de bœuf – beef tongue\n\nGîte (à la noix) – topside\n\nQueue – oxtail\n\nCou – neck\n\nTranche – meaning ‘slice’, implies a steak of any meat other than beef\n\nFilet/ longue/ aloyau – all words for loin. Loin chop is ‘côte première’\n\nIn France you tend to find beef prepared for Bourguignon or Pot au Feu on the label rather than the cut of meat. Often the labels indicate a recommended cooking method. Any meat that says ‘à poêler’ means ‘for frying’, au four is in the oven, à griller to cook under the grill (or in a ridged pan)\n\nTartare de Boeuf a great French speciality and when done right is delicious! This is high quality raw beef normally hand-chopped and cut from the tenderloin/filet mignon. It is traditionally served with a raw egg yolk, chopped onion and chive, herbs, capers and mustard, although every recipe is different!\n\nOrdering a steak in a restaurant in France\n\nBleu – Done on a very hot grill for one minute on each side.\n\nSaignant – Meaning bloody. Very rare, but cooked slightly longer on the second side than a bleu steak.\n\nÀ point – rare to medium rare. Meaning the steak is cooked a little longer than a saignant (very rare) one.\n\nBien cuit – ‘well cooked’. This level will still often have some pinkness in the middle of the meat. A ‘steak bien cuit’ is cooked until the juices run brown on the surface of the steak.\n\nTrès bien cuit – should get you a steak that is totally cooked through! if you can find a French chef that will cook a steak this much!\n\nWhen ordering lamb or duck you can ask for rosé which means a medium rare.\n\nPoulet/Chicken\n\nPoitrine – the Breast\n\nPilon – the lower part of the thigh\n\nHaut de cuisse – the upper part of the thigh\n\nAile – the wing\n\nDos – the back\n\nCou – the neck\n\nChicken, duck, goose and others:\n\nPoulet – chicken\n\nPoulette/Poussin – young chicken\n\nCoq – cockerel\n\nPintade – guinea fowl\n\nDinde – turkey\n\nVolaille – fowl/ poultry\n\nCuisses – thighs\n\nMagret – breast\n\nCarcasse – carcasse for making stocks and soups.\n\nConfit de canard – normally a leg that it is salted and then submerged in its own rendered fat\n\nThis post has taken quite some research and I am sure there are many anomalies of meats and cuts I’ve left out. I’ll update this post as I continue on my culinary adventure in France!\n\nHave meat cuts in France left you puzzled? Please leave a comment below if you’ve found this a helpful guide or have anything that you think I can add.\n\nCAUTION: This blog post does not contain cheese!\n\nWhy not pin this reference guide for later!\n\nFollow me on my culinary and pictorial adventure on Twitter @tasteofsavoie and Instagram\n\nPlease keep up to date and like my facebook pages:\n\nTaste of Savoie and Caro Blackwell-Sights of Savoie\n\nFollow my blog with Bloglovin"
