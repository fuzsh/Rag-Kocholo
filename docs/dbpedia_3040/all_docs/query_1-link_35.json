        "text": "Background and history\n\nAfrican swine fever (ASF) resembles classical swine fever (CSF) (hog cholera) so closely that laboratory tests are required to differentiate them. The clinical signs and post-mortem lesions of the two diseases are almost indistinguishable. ASF is caused by a unique virus which is distinct from that of CSF and which infects only domestic and wild pigs and a variety of soft bodied ticks. The virus is endemic in Africa south of the equator, in warthogs and bush pigs, but the infection in them produces no clinical disease. It circulates between warthogs and the soft bodied ticks which inhabit their burrows. The ticks transmit it through all stages of their life cycle and perpetuate it. It is also endemic in the domestic pigs of some African countries.\n\nThe pig (and its close relatives, boars and hogs) is the only natural host of the double-stranded, Asfarviridae family of viruses, meaning the virus does not cause harm to humans or other animals. This does not mean that humans and other animals cannot spread the virus as carriers; African swine fever (ASF) is commonly carried by arthropods, such as the soft-bodied tick, through uptake of blood from infected pigs.\n\nContamination generally occurs via direct contact with tissue and bodily fluids from infected or carrier pigs, including discharges from the nose, mouth, urine and faeces or infected semen. It also spreads through transport and consumption of contaminated food products, and some cases have originated from failure to comply with biosecurity standards by feeding waste food to domestic pigs. It is believed that a highly pathogenic strain of ASF was introduced to domestic pigs and, subsequently, wild boar populations in the port of Poti, Georgia, in 2007 when waste food from a ship originating in South Africa was fed to local pigs.\n\nAlthough the virus in wild boar and hogs does not manifest any signs of the disease, it remains highly contagious across all swine species and can survive in pigs for long periods of time post-slaughter – even in frozen carcasses. It is also important to note that curing and smoking pork products does not destroy the virus.\n\nIt is vital to immediately distinguish the disease that is infecting a herd; ASF and classical swine fever are caused by very similar viruses which are only distinguishable by laboratory testing. Notifying a vet as soon as any signs arise is the best way to ensure the correct quarantine and treatment procedures are followed – it could save the rest of your pigs.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nPigs that die early in an outbreak may not have any noticeable lesions but as the disease progresses the lesions then are striking. Bright red haemorrhages in the lymph nodes, kidneys, heart and linings of the body cavities are common findings. There may also be excess haemorrhagic fluid in the body cavities and gelatinous fluid in the lungs. The spleen may be enlarged, darkened and crumble on slight pressure.\n\nThe veterinarian will have to send samples to a laboratory which specialises in CSF and ASF diagnosis. The best samples to send are blood, lymph nodes, spleen and, in chronic cases, serum for serology. In the case it is CSF and not ASF, the tonsils might also be sent. The veterinarian should consult the appropriate veterinary authorities on how best to send these.\n\nThe tonsils of the pig are very easy to find. Laying the dead pig on its back, cut away the skin and flesh under and between its lower jaw bone and tongue. The pair of tonsils are two large red patches each about the size of the end half of your thumb or perhaps slightly bigger. Their surfaces are covered with small pits or depressions.\n\nIn South Africa and countries outside Africa it is essential to isolate and identify the virus. Only about six laboratories in the world can do this. In African countries where the disease is endemic in the domestic pig population, the veterinarian may only send serum samples for antibody detection.\n\nThe virus may be isolated in primary cultures of pig bone marrow or peripheral blood leucocytes. Infected cells haemadsorb ie, pig red cells will adhere to them. Virus can also be detected in infected cells by fluorescent antibody tests. ELISA tests are also used to detect antibodies. In doubtful cases samples can be injected into experimental pigs.\n\nSerum antibody titres may be tested in a number of ways. The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and the ELISA tests seem to be the most favoured.\n\nNote that porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, which occurs from time to time in most pig rearing areas can resemble ASF and CSF clinically and at post-mortem examination. Laboratory examination may be necessary to eliminate them form the diagnosis."
