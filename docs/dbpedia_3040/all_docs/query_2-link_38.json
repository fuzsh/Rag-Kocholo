        "text": "PARIS — The old story of the American ingénue who moves to Paris, succumbs to the city’s sensual pleasures (usually by way of a French lover) and masters its hardened customs (never smiling at strangers) is a perennial crowd-pleaser — if the crowds are American, that is.\n\nParisians, however, like to rail against the clichés about their city as the world’s epicenter of romance. So as soon as Netflix released a minute-long trailer for“Emily in Paris,” a series created by Darren Star and starring Lily Collins that is being billed as the Gallic-themed heir to “Sex and the City” and that will premiere on Oct. 2, some French commentators went on the attack.\n\n“Between the beret, the cocktail dresses and the impeccable streets, Parisians had a hard time recognizing their everyday life,” RTL, the French radio station, wrote on its website. Les Inrockuptibles, a French magazine that likes to hate American popular culture, wrote that Parisians were already laughing at the show.\n\nBut when I showed excerpts from 10 episodes to more than a dozen Parisians from the ages of 22 to 81, they elicited more nuanced impressions. Slightly more nuanced.\n\nThe overwhelming response was “ridicule” — French for ridiculous and absurd, as well as comical and amusing.\n\n“Ridicule” that Emily Cooper, a 20-something social media wiz from Chicago, played by Ms. Collins, would unexpectedly find herself responsible for teaching a Parisian luxury marketing firm (clients: a perfumer who is a thinly disguised Frederic Malle and a couturier who is a cross between Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Lacroix) how to improve their Instagram and Twitter game.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
