        "text": "Colin Firth (actor)\n\nIan Holm (actor)\n\nFormat: all-region dvd (worldwide)\n\nRuntime: 107 min\n\nQuality: Excellent\n\nFull uncut version. British director Leslie Megahey here dares to be different to such a degree that the odd outbreak of perfunctory or off-target acting matters not one jot. He has successfully created a distinctive other world, specifically a medieval France which is defined by upper-class corruption, peasant superstition and ecclesiastical apathy.\n\nThis ludicrous mixture of dark comedy and original thrills is revealed through the story of a smart Paris lawyer (Colin Firth) his practice established in the provinces who has to defend a pig on a charge of murder.\n\nThough sometimes creaking under the burden of its own ideas, the film is nonetheless invigorating, intelligent and wonderfully dotty."
