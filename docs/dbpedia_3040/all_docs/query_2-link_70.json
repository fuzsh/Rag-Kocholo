        "text": "The idea that “all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others” is a central theme in George Orwell’s novel “Animal Farm.” The novel is an allegory for the events leading up to the Russian Revolution and the early years of the Soviet Union, and the phrase “some animals are more equal than others” highlights the hypocrisy and corruption of the ruling class.\n\nIn the novel, the pigs take control of the farm after the overthrow of the human owner, Mr. Jones. The pigs initially espouse the principles of Animalism, which are based on equality and the idea that all animals should share in the benefits of their labor. However, as the pigs consolidate their power, they begin to use their intelligence and leadership positions to justify their own privilege and to oppress the other animals.\n\nThe phrase “some animals are more equal than others” is first introduced when the pigs revise the farm’s commandments to suit their own interests. The original commandment “All animals are equal” is changed to “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” This change is meant to justify the pigs’ decision to live in the farmhouse, wear clothes, and engage in trade with humans, all of which are violations of the original principles of Animalism."
