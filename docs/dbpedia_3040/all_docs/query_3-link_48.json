        "text": "Xavier Broche\n\nXavier explains his inspiration behind the design:\n\n“I wanted to describe an alien encounter in a playful way. I imagined how it would be for a simple pig to be at the heart of this historic event.\n\nI found it funny to imagine the alien travelling endlessly across space searching for intelligent life, only to encounter a bewildered pig at the end of this epic journey!\n\nDon’t worry about the pig though - he’ll outwit the alien in the end!”\n\nXavier Broche is a children's book Author-Illustrator based in France.\n\nHe has produced many works for “Les Éditions Lapin”, mainly as part of a series of collaborations with Alice Chaa, a writer for children.\n\nFeathers and brushes, felt-tip pens and inks, the tools vary and the themes change according to the book.\n\nXavier has explored a diverse range of topics in his work: from adoption to travel; fear of the dark to learning numbers and even following the adventures of an unconventional princess...\n\nIn addition to published works, Xavier has also collaborated on radio shows and live drawing events, such as Podcast Science.\n\nSee more of Xavier’s work at: xavierpuyo.com\n\nOr follow Xavier on Instagram here.\n\nOrder processing\n\nWe aim to dispatch all orders within 2-3 working days.\n\nWhen your order is dispatched, your tracking details will be updated.\n\nIf you have opted for a custom engraving please allow an additional 1-2 working days.\n\nIf you are purchasing during a sale or a limited edition release, you can expect an email update with an estimated dispatch date if there any changes to the timeframe.\n\nIf you are in a hurry for your order, please email us. We'll try our best to prioritise your order.\n\nShipping guide for watches\n\nUK: FREE DPD shipping, 1-2 working days\n\nUnited States & Canada: FREE Fedex shipping, 1-3 working days\n\nThe EU: FREE DHL shipping, 1-3 working days. To order to The EU, please visit our Euro website here (duties and taxes are included in the price of your watch).\n\nClick here to see the full shipping guide for watches\n\nShipping guide for t-shirts\n\nOur t-shirts are printed by us and shipped from our workshop in London. This means if you place an order for both a watch and t-shirt(s), they will be shipped together via an express service. Delivery times for these can be found here.\n\nIf you order a t-shirt without a watch, it will be shipped via a Royal Mail tracked service which usually takes a little longer. You can see an estimated timescale when you input your address at the checkout.\n\nShipping guide for watch straps\n\nIf purchased separately from your watch, watch straps will be shipped with Royal Mail 1st Class / International tracked shipping.\n\nThis takes 2-14 working days depending on location. You can see a more accurate timescale when you input your address at the checkout.\n\nThese delivery times are a guide based on the carriers terms of service, products may, in some unusual cases take longer to arrive. If this happens, please get in touch.\n\nReturn your watch for an exchange\n\nWe are happy to exchange unworn watches.\n\nFastening the watch will cause damage to the leather. If this is the case, we charge for the watch strap (or we can put the worn strap on the exchanged watch for free).\n\nPlease email us directly if you think your watch is faulty.\n\nReturn your watch for a refund\n\nTo return for a full refund, you have 30 days if purchased online. After this time we can offer an exchange if your watch hasn’t been worn.\n\nIf you purchased your watch in-store, we can offer an exchange or store credit only. This is because you’ve seen the watch in person and had the opportunity to try it on. Please let us know if you’re purchasing as a gift.\n\nT-shirt returns and Exchanges\n\nWe recommend checking the measurements of our t-shirts on our size guide before placing your order, you can also check them here\n\nHowever, if your t-shirt is faulty, we can offer an exchange or a refund. In this circumstance, please email us within 30 days of placing your order, with a photograph of the problem, as well as your order number.\n\nTo return other products (such as straps) please email us: info@mrjoneswatches.com to arrange this.\n\nUK returns\n\n1) Generate your free returns label here.\n\n2) Print it off and stick it to your original packaging.\n\n3) Take it to your local post office. Find your closest here.\n\n(If you no longer have your original packaging, please ensure your watch is securely wrapped in bubble wrap / something similar to protect it in transit).\n\nNB please include a short note describing the issue with the watch and your contact details.\n\nEU and International returns\n\nPlease send the watch to this address:\n\nMr Jones Watches (repairs)\n\n61 Dartmouth Road\n\nLondon SE23 3HN\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEnsure the watch is securely wrapped in bubble wrap to protect it in transit.\n\nPlease include a note stating:\n\n- the reason for the return\n\n- a detailed description of the problem with your watch (if sending for repair)\n\n- your email address and your order number\n\n- remember to include your return delivery address, (so we know where to send the repaired watch)\n\nWe recommend you use a tracked service.\n\nAs the UK is no longer in the EU, you will have to fill in a Customs Declaration form (usually a CN22).\n\nPlease write in the description field \"wristwatch, return for factory repair / refund , no commercial value.\"\n\nThis is essential otherwise an import duty will be levied which you will be liable for (there is no way for us to reclaim this charge).\n\nPlease note: we do not cover shipping costs for unwanted items, returned from outside of the UK. If you are returning a watch that is faulty we may be able to reimburse shipping costs if your watch is within warranty, please contact us ahead of sending in this instance."
