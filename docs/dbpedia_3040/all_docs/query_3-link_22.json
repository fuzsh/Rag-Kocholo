        "text": "This is an oft-cited \"unusual law\", e.g. from The Sun:\n\nIN FRANCE it is illegal to name a pig Napoleon, almost 200 years after his death.\n\nExperts say the odd law exists because ­calling a pig after the emperor would insult a head of state.\n\nThe best explanation I found is that it was once illegal to offend the head of state. This law changed very recently (emphasis mine):\n\nBeing rude to the French president is no longer an offence after parliament amended legislation dating back to 1881 in favour of freedom of speech.\n\nPreviously any rude remark risked a fine and criminal conviction for \"offending the head of state\". But the change was pushed through after criticism from the European court of human rights.\n\nHowever, this doesn't make much sense:\n\nIf the law dates back to 1881, then it didn't exist during Napoleon's reign.\n\nAs far as unusual laws go, calling a pig after the head of state being illegal sounds just as unusual as calling it Napoleon, so it's odd a non-existent unusual law would become more well-known than a real one along the same lines.\n\nWhy a pig specifically? I imagine naming other farm animals (e.g. a donkey) after the head of state would be equally (in)offensive.\n\nWas there ever a law that would make some pig names illegal in France?"
