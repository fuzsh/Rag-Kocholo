        "text": "Guemene-sur-Scorff in north-west France may not be well known internationally, but a popular French delicacy was born in the town. The andouille de Guemene is a pork sausage made from pigs' intestines and stomachs.\n\nA local andouillerie, Rivalan Quidu, advertises its presence on the outskirts of Guemene-sur-Scorff in Brittany, France, with a sculpture in the corner of its vast car park.\n\nYou won't need to take a great leap of imagination to visualise what a representation, in fibreglass, of two giant andouilles might be mistaken for, but the locals take their home-grown delicacy very seriously indeed.\n\nA steady stream of customers - from passing tourists to lorry drivers on their regular beat - pull in to buy a chunk.\n\nThe andouille de Guemene is a relatively new phenomenon - the recipe having been created only in 1930 by Joseph Quidu, the son of a local farmer - but Gallic gourmands with a fascination for all elements of the gastrointestinal tract of a pig have embraced it as a classic.\n\nAs I push open the shop door I'm enveloped by the aromas of fat and smoke. I suspect just breathing the air could send my cholesterol levels into double figures.\n\nThe stones are caked in glistening, sooty fat. Behind the counter is Benoit, husband of Joseph's grand-daughter Francoise, who together with their children are carrying the tradition of the andouille de Guemene into its third and fourth generations.\n\nOut at the back, away from the public gaze - and possibly out of respect for the squeamish - is the kitchen where the andouilles are created in a modern style true to Joseph's original recipe.\n\nInspired, I like to imagine, by the act of pulling on more than one pair of socks to counter the cold and damp Breton winters, Joseph pulled one length of chaudin - or pig intestine - over another, and then another. Around 20 or 25 in all.\n\nThe salted intestines of three pigs, weighing in at 3kg, go into each andouille, which are then smoked over oak wood and dried, sometimes for months on end before being cooked slowly in stock. Cut through, the innards resemble pinky-grey tree rings carrying a distinctly smoky taste and aroma.\n\nBenoit had never tasted andouille until he started courting Francoise. He cheerfully admits he at first thought it bizarre, but he saw the potential - especially when, back in the 90s, endorsement by France's outspoken celebrity chef and food campaigner Jean-Pierre Coffe saw demand skyrocket.\n\nJoseph made about five andouilles a week, his son Laurent made about 200, and today Rivalan Quidu employs nine people turning out 1,000 a week.\n\nThe younger andouilles, dried for just two or three weeks, are cut up and sauteed in hot dishes. The sausages dried for three months are more shrivelled, more intensely flavoured and served in paper-thin slices as an aperitif, with a glass of chilled muscadet or local cider.\n\nAndouilles de Guemene must never be confused with the ubiquitous, cheap and cheerful, andouillette. These are the plump, loose-stuffed sausages which when cut open spill out a grisly assortment of components like an organic Airfix kit.\n\nThe andouille de Guemene is a much more sophisticated speciality with a price tag to match. It retails at 39 euros ($50, Â£30) per kg. Benoit helps me do the maths, approximately Â£1 per inch (2.5cm)."
