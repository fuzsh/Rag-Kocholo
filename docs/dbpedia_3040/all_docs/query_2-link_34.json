        "text": "Gordon King, Animal & Poultry Science, University of Guelph\n\nPigs and their farm role changed dramatically during the past fifty years. During the first half of the 20th century, the pigs found on most farms were primarily a waste disposal system that contributed the occasional meal and even less freq uent revenue. Scavenger pigs still abound as part of a mixed, subsistence farming system in almost all of the less developed countries. Now, however, these often exist in close association with large, specialized units producing for both local and export markets.\n\nAs indicated in the following chart, pork production currently leads all other meat outputs by a considerable margin. Based on the volume of product marketed, pigs, either as part of mixed farming operations or in specialized units, comprise the major livestock enterprise throughout the world.\n\nPig Breeds and Breeding Systems\n\nAll of our domesticated pigs probably descended from the Eurasian wild boar with major sites of development in both the middle east and in China. Many generations of selective breeding produced the conformation found in our modern breeds. Some of the m ore common breeds in Canada and throughout the rest of the world today are the Yorkshire or Large White, Landrace. Duroc and Hampshire. Check the Oklahoma State agricultural library for inform ation on specific breeds of pigs.\n\nPork Production Systems\n\nPigs breed at all times of the year so pork production is a continuous cycle. Traditionally, sows farrowed periodically, piglets were retained after weaning around eight weeks of age, grew slowly, and were consumed eventually or sold by their original owners. Now pigs may constitute the only type of livestock present on a farm with the system often further specialized by operators concentrating on specific stages of the production sequence.\n\nSome farms still keep and mate sows, farrow the liters and raise piglets to market weight. These are called farrow to finish operations. Other farmers engage in weaner production, maintaining breeding herds but selling all their piglets at around ten weeks of age to some other farmer. Those who keep no breeding animals but purchase all of their pigs from weaner producers are called finishing or feeder operators. The pig finishers or fe eders then takes care of these purchased animals until they reach market weight. Regardless of the type of operation, all hog farmers must arrange for appropriate facilities and care to look after their stock. In addition to the moral obligation to provid e humane care, producers recognize that their livelihoods depends on creating an environment that keeps animals healthy and comfortable so they can express their full genetic potential. Careful and conscientious management is essential for ecologically fr iendly and profitable production so it benefits the pigs, the producers and all of society.\n\nHeritability is the expected response of a trait or characteristic based on the parents' genetic merit (ie. their breeding value or ability to transmit the trait to offspring) rather than the effect due to environmental factors. Heritability is most of ten expressed as a decimal or percentage. For example, the heritability of backfat thickness is about 0.5. This means that approximately 50% of the difference in backfat between individual animals is due to genetics while the remainder results from non-ge netic (environmental) factors. Similar quantitative traits like milk production, growth rate, feed efficiency and other aspects of carcass quality also have reasonably high heritability so respond quickly to genetic selection. In contrast, the environment al factors are considerably more important in traits like fertility or litter size so, in addition to genetic selection, other methods are necessary to improve these characteristics.\n\nThe goal of any genetic improvement program is to increase the economic value of the progeny. Requirements for a successful outcome are:\n\nidentification of traits that are likely to remain important\n\nassessment of their relative significance\n\ndetermination of potential heredity\n\nselection of most important and amenable ones for primary emphasis\n\na large population to work with\n\na reliable recording and evaluating system\n\nMethods for Assessment of Potential Genetic Worth\n\nPedigree evaluation - based on assessment of ancestor performance. This approach provides a suggestion of what an animal might be capable of doing.\n\nPerformance testing - based on evaluating how an individual performs under specific conditions. This shows what the animal can do - but provides no assurance that the performance can be passed to offspring.\n\nProgeny testing - evaluates performance of progeny. This shows what can be passed on to offspring.\n\nSuperior performance resulting from good management does not automatically repeat in the next generation whereas that obtained from genetic superiority will be transmitted to progeny. The key to obtaining genetic improvement is distinguishing between t he genetic and environmental factors influencing performance and selecting only those animals that are genetically superior as parents of the next generation.\n\nEstimated Breeding Value (EBV). An EBV is the estimated genetic worth of a particular animal for a specific trait. EBV=s are calculated from performance records of individuals and progeny.\n\nSelection Index. Once selection priorities are decided, it is useful if the EBV information for the various factors can be combined into a single index based on the relative economic values, heitabilities and any correlations between them. For maximum usefulness, any selection index should be updated regularly with new information and adjusted for any changes in economic importance of particular traits.\n\nFactors Affecting Rate of Improvement\n\nGenetic variability within the population. There must be a diverse genotypes (heterozygosity) present within the population, providing a wide range of responses to select from, to provide opportunity for obtaining substantial improvement within a reas onable time.\n\nAccuracy of predicting true genetic value. Must be able to evaluate true genetic component of trait(s) under consideration by eliminating environmental components.\n\nSelection pressure. The greater the selection pressure, the faster the progress. Selecting the best one out of one hundred tested animals would be better than the best ten out of the hundred. Usually selection is concentrated on the male side since ma les, once selected, can sire many progeny.\n\nGeneration interval. If all other factors are equal, faster progress would be made in pigs than in cattle since the generation interval is shorter.\n\nBreeding Programs\n\nPurebred Based\n\nAnimals of known ancestry (pedigreed) always used in all parts of the breeding program from which any replacements would be kept.\n\nInbreeding\n\n. Occasionally, the top breeders mate closely related animals in an attempt to consolidate specific, desirable traits. While this can produce exceptional individuals, it may also concentrate undesirable genes and result in p oorer quality or even lethal defects.\n\nLinebreeding\n\n. A less intensive form of inbreeding. The same ancestor appears more than once in the grandparent or great-grandparent generations.\n\nOutbreeding\n\n. Mating only unrelated animals within the same breed.\n\nCrossbreeding\n\nThis involves mating animals of different recognized breeds (or strains?) to exploit the strengths of each (complementarity). Crossbreeding also exploits the phenomenon of heterosis, an increase in productivity of the crossbred over and above the avera ge of breeds or lines that are crossed.\n\nImprovement Systems\n\nWithin line selection to improve specific traits. Any attempts to influence genotype, particularly for poly-genic traits, is difficult, time consuming and expensive. This is an obvious method for use within purebred herds since they must demonstrate im provement to remain competitive. If herds are not selling breeding stock, they may still retain pure lines but the expense of purebred registration is not likely to be justified. Because of the costs involved, this approach is becoming more and more conce ntrated within large and often multinational breeding companies.\n\nProducers should always be aware of what is happening elsewhere. This allows rapid introduction of new lines already improved in other locations.\n\nCrossbreeding\n\nSuccessful production requires animals with good genotype for traits of economic importance plus the ability to withstand reasonable degrees of stress while maintaining high voluntary feed intake and feed conversion efficiency. Pig farmers may obtain s uch animals from within their own herd or purchase them from other suppliers. The optimum genotype varies with market demand. Asians and Italians still prefer some fat on their pork but Germans and French want none. Canadians and Americans are somewhere i n between these extremes.\n\nHealthy pigs without the proper genotype may not always be profitable pigs but unhealthy pigs cannot be profitable regardless of genotype. Hybrid vigor and vaccinations aid in maintaining good health but provision of a satisfactory environment is even more important. This is particularly true in the nursery area since recently weaned piglets are the most susceptible to disease. People operating growing-finishing units should be very careful where they obtain their stock since it is much easier to keep disease out than it is to eliminate it once an infection gets started. An all-in all-out system is best. Farmers forced into continuous production should isolate all new additions for a period before entrance to the main herd.\n\nHousing and Management\n\nPig husbandry follows several patterns. Throughout those regions of the world where subsistence farming predominates, pigs usually roam freely, rooting or scavenging for whatever feed they can find for themselves. Such scavenger pigs must be prevented from foraging in gardens or grain plots during the active growing seasons. Also, some form of constraint is necessary at night if attack by predators or theft might occur. Pigs in the industrialized countries are usually confined throughout most or all of the production cycle. Some form of pasture feeding, often combined with open-fronted shed housing, may be incorporated into the confinement systems whenever climate and land availability allow.\n\nThe pork production sequence can be divided into five phases; mating, gestating, farrowing, nursery and growing-finishing. Animals have specific needs at each of these stages, requiring appropriate husbandry and facilities to insure that they receive p roper attention and care. Although specific housing varies considerably between regions and even between farms within regions, all animal housing should be constructed to look after the well being of the pigs and their attendants.\n\nThe comfort zones and management requirements change substantially throughout a pig's life. Modern units are designed to allow convenient movement of animals to appropriate quarters as their needs change during the production sequence from birth to market or during the reproductive cycle. The design goal is to provide the best possible environment for both pigs and people. Obviously, this must be done within some economic constraints.\n\nExtensive or systems with animals running outside whenever possible requires less capital and perhaps management expertise but they are labor intensive whenever animals must be moved or handled in any way.\n\nConfinement housing is capital intensive for both buildings and equipment but provides opportunity for automation and labor reduction. Proper operation of these systems demand considerable management expertise. Our pig buildings fall into two main clas ses:\n\ninsulated and usually ventilated mechanically, often with supplemental heating so that the temperature is always maintained above freezing.\n\nInsulated and naturally ventilated, with or without supplementary heating, temperature rarely allowed to fall below comfort zone for most animals but may approximate ambient conditions for gestating sows.\n\nSpecial areas must be provided for animals in various stages of the production sequence.\n\nMating Area\n\nrequires good lighting, footing, access to pens, and facilities for convenient movement of animal to facilitate handling of individuals and mating pairs.\n\nadequate housing for boars - usually individual pens.\n\nadequate housing for recently weaned sows - usually in groups to facilitate estrus detection.\n\nadequate housing for replacement gilts - usually in groups.\n\nGestating Area\n\nGroup pens - more social interaction but the submissive animals may get insufficient feed and possibly injuries. Dominant animals may get too fat.\n\nIndividual stalls or crates - these restrict animal movement but allow hand feeding to actual requirements and eliminate competitive injuries.\n\nShed or pasture systems.\n\nFarrowing Area\n\nThe farrowing facility is the most expensive area to construct and equip. Producers should optimize use of this facility. Empty crates = reduced efficiency.\n\nThe most common area for pig parturition is the farrowing crates. These come in many designs and still allow scope for improvement.\n\nThe major challenge in designing a suitable farrowing facility is that the comfort zones for sows and newborn piglets are considerably different. Thus, supplemental heating is necessary to provide an optimum environment for the piglets. Supplemental heating can be from electric heat lamps, radiant gas heaters, forced air or floor heating.\n\nInclusion of individual kennels for piglets in the farrowing crate design creates a two-environment situation where piglets can choose between different temperatures. Piglets often lie with their snouts outside and the rest of their bodies inside the curtain, taking advantage of both options.\n\nThe farrowing crates are usually allocated into a number of individual rooms. Each room should operate with an All-In All-Out system.\n\nShelters for pasture farrowing are available. These provide a year round alternative in milder climates but may not be suitable if winters are very cold.\n\nHow many farrowing crates are needed?\n\nCalculate the Pen-Cycle:\n\nPen-Cycle = [(filling crates in room = x days) + (nursing period = x days) + (cleaning period = x days)]\n\nPens needed = [No. of sows x litters per sow per year x pen-cycle &divide; 365]\n\nWeaning (Nursery) Area\n\nFor piglets from weaning to 9 or 10 weeks of age.\n\nMany designs, on floor, raised or even decks.\n\nSmaller piglets do not generate sufficient body heat to warm a large area so supplementary heat is necessary at beginning of period in the nursery area.\n\nDual environment pens are becoming increasingly popular, particularly whenever very early weaning is practiced. The enclosed, heated kennel provides a resting area that is warmer than the outside space. The energy us ed for heating is much lower with these kennels that in houses where the entire room is warmed. Also, pigs have a choice between different temperature zones.\n\nIn conjunction with any housing areas, pig units require facilities for moving, handling and restraining pigs of various sizes.\n\nGrowth and Reproductive Data for Pigs\n\nMany sows come into estrus about 4 to 7 days after weaning (range for most sows is 3 - 10 days but 1st litter gilts may take longer). Thus, producers with large herds usually try to wean on Thursday so that many sows show estrus and require mating on the following Monday to Thursday. This reduces, but does not eliminate, the need for weekend mating chores.\n\nMating Systems\n\nNatural, Pen or Pasture Mating\n\n. In this system the boars and females run together in the same pen of pasture. Advantages are effective estrus detection and low labor requirement. The disadvantage is lack of recorded matings so inferti le animals cannot be culled and females cannot be moved into a proper farrowing area at the appropriate time.\n\nNatural, Hand Mating\n\n. Boars and females kept in separate pens with daily checks for estrus and matings as required. Advantages are better identification and recording (essential for purebred herds), more effective use of boar-power, a bility to cull infertile animals plus the information necessary to adjust the feeding and management as gestational needs change.\n\nAI - Commercial Supply\n\n. Commercial or cooperative boar studs supply semen in many regions. These are usually a good source of superior genetic material. Semen can be obtained in individual doses or bulk lots. AI allows importation of semen from distant regions or from other countries. Some specialized handling and storage equipment is necessary.\n\nAI - Within Herd\n\n. Operators collect semen from their own boars and inseminate their own sows. This requires some training and equipment. Within herd AI makes the most efficient use of boar-power. It requires a little more time than us ing commercial semen suppliers but less time than properly supervised hand mating in larger herds. Producers can combine AI on heavy demand days and hand mating on lighter days.\n\nAdditional information is available on mating management and farrowing.\n\nWeaning\n\nNewborn piglets have very limited ability to digest feed. The sow compensates for this by producing milk, a readily digested diet supplying almost all the nutritional requirements of her offspring, and offering this frequently. Also, the immune system is immature at birth so piglets have no inherent resistance to disease and cannot generate any real protection for five or six weeks. Antibodies concentrated in sow colostrum compensate for this initial deficiency but protection is short and usually has d isappeared by weaning time (ie. in 3 to 5 weeks). Weaning, particularly at younger ages, involves a sudden change of diet and environment, so is certainly one of the most potentially distressing stages in a piglets life.\n\nClick for additional information on weaning.\n\nGrowth\n\nGrowth is an anabolic process resulting in an increase in body mass over a period of time. The enlargement in body size of domesticated animals, taking place throughout the period from conception to maturity, is the basis of meat production. Growth occ urs in two ways, through an increase in cell numbers (hyperplasia) or an increase in cell size (hypertrophy). Neither the whole body mass nor its individual tissues an organs grow at exactly the same rate so growth is asynchronous. One of the major challe nges in livestock production is deciding when is the optimum time to market animals. Since feed efficiency declines as the growth rate slows, making the correct decision on when to market is often the difference between profit and loss.\n\nThe progressive changes in body shape, size and chemical composition occurring between conception and full maturity result in both structural and functional changes in the constituent parts. These pertain to the stage of physiological maturity and rela te to product quality. The natural growth process favors development of muscle tissue throughout much of the growing-finishing period. As animals near their fully mature body size, however, the natural tendency is to reduce muscle and increase fat deposit ion. Producers generally try to market them just before or very shortly after this transition.\n\nGrowth can be manipulated by injection of recombinant porcine somatotrophin.\n\nSpace\n\nThere is considerable disparity in recommendations on space requirement for growing and finishing pigs. Up to a point, the more space - the better the performance. All housing is a compromise between maximizing performance of each pig in a pen and opti mizing the financial return from investment. Whenever housing costs are low and feed is expensive, operators can be more liberal with space allowed per pig. In many confinement units, groups start out with considerably excessive space and grow into it. Us ually, they finish with a slight deficiency but, since the largest animals are soon marketed, the crowded situation should not persist.\n\nLess floor space is necessary with ample feeding and watering facilities since competition is minimized or eliminated. In contrast, more space per animal is necessary with higher ambient temperature or if ventilation may not be adequate during the hott er summer months.\n\nIdeally, sexes should be penned separately.\n\nPigs can also be grown and finished outside.\n\nFeeding\n\nDiets for growing pigs from 20-50 kg should contain 18% protein. The protein content can then be reduced to 16% for animals up to market weight. Properly formed pellets are preferred since they reduce dust and wastage. Pellets also flow easily through automated feeding equipment.\n\nFull Feeding\n\nutilizes self feeders which can be filled automatically or by hand at regular intervals;\n\nvery convenient;\n\nfed is always available;\n\nfeeders should be designed to eliminate wastage (hinged lids, internal dividers, in-turned lips);\n\nshould allow pigs to empty feeders once per week to prevent build-up of stale feed.\n\nRestricted Feeding\n\nusually 80-85% of full feeding ;\n\ncan reduce fat deposition at later stages of growth so get better carcasses;\n\nfill feeders daily with amount pigs should consume in 20-22 hours;\n\ncan simply spread feed on floor several times per day (if concrete rather than slats).\n\nWet Feeding System\n\nfeed and water mixed in a central tank and then delivered by pipeline to appropriate feeding troughs in pens;\n\ngood dust control\n\nideal for garbage feeding\n\na wet system is too bulky for pigs below 40 kg.\n\nFor some additional information on diet formulation and ingredients go to the accompanying section on Feeding Pigs.\n\nKeeping Pigs Healthy\n\nRaising healthy livestock should be both aesthetically and financially rewarding, but keeping unhealthy animals is almost never profitable or satisfying. Current knowledge and technology, when combined with sound management, should result in very low i ncidence or even elimination of most diseases. Unfortunately, even though most producers are aware of this point, some still seek magic panaceas rather than committing to the provision of proper housing, sound nutrition, scrupulous sanitation and appropri ate vaccinations.\n\nSome general recommendations for sound management and disease prevention are:\n\npractice \"all-in all-out\" whenever practical;\n\nkeep ages and sexes separate;\n\nisolate any new additions;\n\nprovide supervision and assistance as required;\n\nfurnish appropriate housing for all ages and production stages with adequate space, ventilation, sanitation, diet, water and other essentials;\n\nfollow appropriate preventative medicine practices using vaccinations, anthelmintics and other pharmaceuticals as required;\n\nmaintain a special facility to allow individual care for sick or disabled animals.\n\nWhen vaccinating or injecting pigs, always administer the material into the neck muscles rather than into the ham or rump regions. If bruising, scarring or abscesses should occur, these will result in trimming loss of a less valuable portion of the car cass.\n\nAdditional Information on Pigs\n\nCheck the Swine Care Handbook prepared by the National Pork Producers Council for additional information on management, housing, feeding, herd health and producer responsibilities. The NPPC also provides access to a considerable amount of other useful information relating to pigs.\n\nSome other potentially useful links for information on pigs:\n\nOMAFRA Pig Information\n\nOntario Swine Improvement Inc.\n\nCanadian Swine Breeders Association\n\nSwine Resources from Oklahoma State University\n\nGo to Review Questions."
