        "text": "I thought until now, like many French people, that it was indeed forbidden in France to call your pig Napoleon. This belief was not the result of a thorough research due to my willingness to acquire a pig and call it that. No.\n\nIt was just an unverified belief propagated on the so-called serious French media (for example an article in Le Monde on 7 February 2013).\n\nIt seems that this belief was based on George Orwell‚Äôs 1945 book Animal Farm, in which a pig named Napoleon leads the revolt against humans.\n\nWhen the French version was published in 1947, the French publisher categorically refused to keep this name for a pig. So the name of the pig was changed to ‚ÄúC√©sar‚Äù. The name Napoleon was rightly reassigned to the revolutionary pig from the 1981 editions onwards.\n\nJustice is done!"
