        "text": "The issue of castration was highlighted at the recent SPACE trade show in Rennes, France. In side symposia attention was given to the pending changes.\n\nMany slaughterhouses not ready to accept boars\n\nThe castration regulations are giving France’s swine producers a hard time, explained Valérie Courboulay (pictured), specialist in animal welfare at the French Pork and Pig Institute (IFIP). The main issue is that many slaughterhouses as well as meat processors are not ready to largely dealing with meat from entires. At the moment, roughly 25% of the male pigs is not being castrated in France – with the expectation that this amount will grow to 30% by the end of the year.\n\nThere are currently 3 alternatives for pig producers: keeping entires, using immunocastration or using local anaesthetics with analgesics. Performing complete anaesthesia on piglets is a job that pig producers are not allowed to do. So far, it is unclear which option will be the prevalent one by the time 2022 comes. Corboulay said that the market will be leading in this.\n\nPiglet castration rules are unclear\n\nOne other thing that is not 100% clear for swine producers is how anaesthetics will have to be applied and under which conditions. For local anaesthetics, lidocaine can be used. Also, a strategy involving the gel type Tri-solfen is currently in the picture to play a role, even though that last product is still in the experimental phase and has not been approved for use.\n\nVaccination to avoid physical piglet castration\n\nImmunocastration using vaccination is a niche in France. About 30% of the producers has chosen this approach. They produce for a special concept for finisher pigs that are being sent to slaughter at 150 kg, in which physical castration is not allowed.\n\nCooperl: Leading the way"
