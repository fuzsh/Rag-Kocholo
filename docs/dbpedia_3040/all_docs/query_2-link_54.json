        "text": "What is ASF?\n\nAfrican swine fever is a highly contagious haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, responsible for serious production and economic losses due to its high mortality rate and the control measures implemented by affected countries. It is caused by a DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family.\n\nAlthough signs of ASF and classical swine fever (CSF) may be similar, the ASF virus is unrelated to the CSF virus.\n\nASF does not affect human health.\n\nAlthough signs of ASF and classical swine fever (CSF) may be similar, the ASF virus is unrelated to the CSF virus.\n\nASF does not affect human health.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of ASF?\n\nClinical signs and mortality rates can vary according to the virulence of the virus and the type/species of pig:\n\nAcute forms are characterised by high fever, depression, anorexia and loss of appetite, haemorrhages in the skin (redness of skin on ears, abdomen and legs), abortion in pregnant sows, cyanosis, vomiting, diarrhea and death within 6-13 days (or up to 20 days). Mortality rates may be as high as 100%.\n\nSubacute and chronic forms are caused by moderately or low virulent viruses, which produce less intense clinical signs that can be expressed for much longer periods. Mortality rates are lower but can still range from 30-70%. Chronic disease symptoms include weight loss, intermittent fever, respiratory signs, chronic skin ulcers and arthritis.\n\nDifferent types of pig may have varying susceptibility to ASF virus infection. African wild suids may be infected without showing clinical signs, allowing them to act as reservoirs.\n\nWhere does ASF come from?\n\nAfrican swine fever has traditionally been present in Africa, until 1978 when the disease was introduced to the Italian island of Sardinia. In 2007, the disease was confirmed in the Caucasus region of Georgia and, from there, the ASF virus gradually spread to neighbouring countries affecting domestic pigs and wild boar.\n\nThe first occurrence of ASF in the European Union (EU) was reported in 2014 and since then, numerous EU countries have been affected by this devastating pig disease. Yet, two European countries have also managed to eradicate it:\n\nBelgium (March 2020) and Czech Republic (April 2018).\n\nIn 2018, the virus leapt to China (People’s Rep. of), representing the first occurrence of ASF in Asia. Since then, the disease has continued to spread in this region and in Oceania.\n\nIn July 2021, the disease reappeared in the Americas after an absence of almost 40 years, having been introduced in Dominican Republic and later in Haiti.\n\nAccess the latest updates on the current situation.\n\nHow does ASF spread?\n\nThe epidemiology of ASF is complex and varies depending on the environment, types of pig production systems, the presence or absence of competent tick vectors, human behaviour, and the presence or absence of wild pigs.\n\nRoutes of transmission can include:\n\n– direct contact between infected pigs, domestic or wild;\n\n– ingestion of material contaminated with the virus (e.g. food waste, feed, or garbage);\n\n– contact with contaminated fomites (such as clothing, footwear or vehicles), or\n\n– bite of biological vectors (soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros), where present.\n\nHow is ASF diagnosed?\n\nAfrican swine fever may be suspected based on clinical signs, but confirmation must be made with laboratory tests, particularly to differentiate it from classical swine fever (CSF). Guidance on diagnostic tests for ASF can be found in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals.\n\nCan humans get ASF?\n\nASF is not a risk to human health.\n\nIt is safe to eat pork?\n\nHumans do not get sick from African swine fever. The disease cannot be transmitted to humans through contact with pigs or by consuming pork products. However, meat contaminated with the ASF virus should not be used to feed pigs, as pigs can get infected this way. It is therefore recommended to avoid feeding pigs with food scraps or kitchen waste that have not been properly treated.\n\nShould cases of ASF be notified to the WOAH?\n\nASF is a WOAH-listed disease. It is therefore mandatory for national Veterinary Authorities to notify WOAH of any ASF case in a timely manner. At the same time, countries may also self-declare the absence of ASF from their territory on a voluntary basis.\n\nMaintaining transparency on the global situation of African swine fever is key to facilitate the implementation of early measures that could halt the spread of the disease.\n\nHow can we prevent ASF?\n\nBiosecurity is the most important and effective measure available to prevent and control African swine fever. Rigorous and continuous implementation of biosecurity principles at farm level, as well as increasing vigilance at borders to prevent the illegal movement of ASF-infected animals or commodities, can halt the virus from entering pig herds.\n\nIt is equally important that all those who might be involved in the direct and indirect transmission of ASF are made aware and acknowledge the importance and potential consequences of their actions. In this scenario, efficient risk communication becomes also an essential component of the disease prevention efforts. To support countries, WOAH, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has developed an awareness campaign that targets different actors who are susceptible to play a role in the spread of the disease. Hunters, small pig farmers and large commercial pig producers, as well as travellers and the transport industry, are called upon to be actively engaged in curbing the spread of this deadly pig disease.\n\nCan African swine fever be controlled?\n\nDespite the complexity and challenging characteristics of ASF, its global control is possible with sustained effort and collaboration at national, regional and international levels. For this reason, in 2020, WOAH launched the Initiative for the Global Control of ASF in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), under the umbrella of the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs). Its goal: bringing together governments, industry and experts to support our Members in their effort to control this devastating pig disease.\n\nWhat are the WOAH’s goals regarding ASF control?\n\nTo achieve global control, ASF requires adequate risk management through the development and implementation of national control programmes. Through the Initiative for the Global Control of ASF, WOAH and FAO aim to improve the capability of countries to prevent, respond to and eradicate the disease using WOAH International Standards and best practices that are based on the latest science available. The goal is also to establish an effective coordination and cooperation framework for the control of ASF at global, regional and local level and to facilitate business continuity while ensuring safe production and trade to protect food systems."
