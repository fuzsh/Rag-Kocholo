        "text": "Why would you want to know about weird French foods? Well, you may or may not want to eat them! Unless you are French or an adventurous eater, you may want to make sure you don’t order some of these famous French delicacies. Been there, done that.\n\nOn the flip side, if you want to fully explore traditional French cuisine, eating some of the weird food in France is a must. Depending on where you’re from, some of these interesting foods may even sound like culinary delights. Some are even on my Top 10 Foods To Eat in Paris list.\n\nAfter all, French chefs can make almost anything taste delicious. Therefore, France is probably the best place to try something that you’re not familiar with. Most of what some tourists think of as the weirdest foods are actually popular foods found readily in French restaurants and food markets, especially if you’re traveling in their region of origin.\n\nIn European countries, they eat much more offal than in the United States, and there is much more focus on utilizing the whole animal. The keyword being “animal”: Most of these unusual French dishes are not vegetarian. Most of them will also not be included in a must-eat France travel guide or travel blog.\n\nBut like I said, it all depends on your frame of reference whether you’ll consider these to be disgusting French foods or delectable delicacies of France.\n\nWeird Foods in France\n\nL’Oursin - Sea Urchin\n\nPeople eat sea urchin in many parts of the world outside of France, especially in Asian cultures. In fact, the first time I ate urchin was at a sushi restaurant; it was raw and tasted like the sea. In France, l’oursin is also most often consumed raw.\n\nWhat makes sea urchins one of the most unusual foods is their appearance. Sharp, pointy, needle-like spines cover the outer layer of these round-shaped invertebrates. One can easily understand where the name sea hedgehog, used in several languages, comes from. One also wonders why anyone ever thought something tasty would be inside.\n\nWith its slimy orange flesh, the insides of les oursins can be just as off-putting as the outside. Yet they are so revered in the south of France, the Mediterranean city of Séte celebrates them every year with a festival in March.\n\nEscargots - Snails\n\nSnails, another one of the famous French delicacies that very few look at their first time and think, “Ooh, can’t wait to sink my teeth into those!” Admittedly, the French word “escargots” sounds much more appetizing, so that helps.\n\nFrench food lore says edible land snails were first served in 1814 at a meal for Czar Alexander and Talleyrand, Napoleon’s chief advisor. The restaurant was out of food and the chef improvised with the snails he found in the garden. With butter, garlic, and parsley, he invented Escargots de Bourgogne, or Burgundy Snails.\n\nToday, this is one of the most famous regional specialties and one of the quintessential foods associated with France.\n\nAs someone who picks up snails and moves them off the sidewalk so that no one steps on them, it took me a long time to muster the courage to eat them. It may be that my love for butter and garlic can overcome almost anything, but I genuinely like them. In Paris, one of the best spots to try Escargots de Bourgogne is aptly called L’Escargot Montorgueil on one of my favorite Paris food streets, Rue Montorgueil.\n\nTête de Veau - Calf’s Head\n\nThis is perhaps the weirdest French food, in my opinion, and one that can turn you off at first sight. Unless you are used to whole animal heads on the dining room table.\n\nTête de veau has two main recipes. I won’t judge you harshly if you don’t want to try either. Does it help to know that former French president Jacque Chirac favored eating calf’s head?\n\nThe first recipe consists of the entire head minus the tongue and brain. Don’t worry, as you’ll read later, these are not wasted. The calf’s head is simmered for hours until the meat can fall off the bone and the skin becomes gelatinous. The head is placed on the table, and voilà!\n\nThe second option slices the meat off the bone and it is then smothered in gribiche sauce, made from blending hard-boiled eggs with mustard and oils.\n\nFromage de Tête - Head Cheese\n\nAlthough not what Americans first think of when they hear the word “charcuterie,” head cheese will be found at butchers who specialize in these meat products.\n\nAnother word of caution: Head cheese, or fromage de tête, has nothing to do with cheese. It is a terrine made from the fat, skin, and meat of a calf or pig head set in aspic. It is then sliced and served cold, sometimes on a slice of bread or in a sandwich.\n\nIs this any less weird than the tête de veau? Probably not. But seeing the whole head of the tête de veau can make me a little queasy.\n\nFromage Puant - Stinky Cheese\n\nConsuming cheese on a regular basis at any time of day, even after dinner, is one of the French eating habits I fully get behind.\n\nAs a cheeseaholic, I think French cheese is the best in the world. But they’re not all mild like camembert or brie.\n\nWith over 1,000 types of cheeses, there are bound to be a few that cross the line into gross French food, or at least foods I’d rather not eat.\n\nSome cheeses need an acquired taste before you grow to like them, others require an acquired smell. If you want stinky cheese to be part of your French gastronomic experience, start with a couple of the safer stinkers, like époisses with its mushroomy barnyard aromas, brie noir, and the mold king of blue cheese, Roquefort.\n\nThen, you can move on to even more pungent cheeses like Vieux Lille, nicknamed “old stinky,” and Vieux-Boulogne, rated the smelliest cheese in the world many times.\n\nOne of the most unusual French foods has to be casgiu merzu, a cheese made in Corsica with insect larva. For the record, on the neighboring island of Sardinia, an Italian cheese with a similar name, casu martzu is made the same way.\n\nPieds de Porc – Pig’s Trotters\n\nIf you’re a fan of pig parts, you may already know that pieds de porc, or pig’s trotters, are pig’s feet, and that this part of the pig is used in recipes within just about every culture where pork is eaten. Waste not, want not, and all that. But although pig’s feet are a low-cost cut, the prepared dish has for centuries been popular among every strata of French society, including royalty. In fact, when King Louis XVI fled Paris during the French Revolution, he is known to have stopped in the village of Sainte-Menehould and enjoyed the still-famous style of pieds de porc made there.\n\nBack in Paris, the legendary brasserie Au Pied de Cochon (another term for pig’s foot), has been serving not only pig’s feet but many other delicious French dishes of humble origin since it opened in 1947. Open 24 hours a day, it is said to have never closed since, and it’s a great place to order the dish to try for yourself the next time you’re in the French capital.\n\nLangue de Boeuf – Beef Tongue\n\nWorking our way not head to toe, but in reverse, we come next to beef tongue, or langue de boeuf. This is yet more proof that the use of offal in the kitchen is a time-honored practice in France that continues to this day.\n\nLangue de boeuf can be found on menus in a variety of offerings. It is often boiled or poached until quite tender and then served hot with a sauce. Other times, it is cooked in a similar fashion but then cooled and refrigerated and served cold with sides. It can even be cut into thin slices and used as cold cuts, included on charcuterie boards, or used as the main protein in a salad. Whether you lick your chops in anticipation of having some, or stick your own tongue out at the thought of eating another, now that you know the term langue de beouf, you won’t be tongue tied if you’re ever offered some.\n\nLa Viande de Cheval – Horse Meat\n\nThe popularity of la viande de cheval has ebbed and flowed over the course of French history. It was long banned by a papal decree in the 8th century, but following the French Revolution of 1789, the horses of the aristocracy were confiscated and used as food for the starving masses.\n\nIn 1866, the French legalized the sale of horse meat at special butcher shops. The reasoning was that horse was not only a cheap alternative to other meats beyond affordability for most people, but that being chosen for the butcher shop was a kinder end for horses than being worked to death.\n\nHorse meat became popular, considered little different from other meats, and was prepared in various ways as just another mealtime option. But over time, as work horses were replaced by machines and horses became more akin in most minds to fancy pets you could ride, attitudes—and prices—changed. Although today horse meat can be sold in regular butcher shops and even French supermarkets, prices have soared while sales have plummeted, and you’ll rarely see cheval on a restaurant menu.\n\nCouilles de Mouton - Sheep Testicles\n\nSince even here in the United States, we have Rocky Mountain Oysters, it’s no surprise that the inventory of strange French foods would include sheep balls (which is actually the more accurate translation of couilles de mouton—if somewhat less formal than what I chose above).\n\nThe most popular version of the dish served as a main course is known as Les Frivolités Bénéventines and hails from the region of Périgord, which is also the birthplace of foie gras. Basically, the couilles are peeled, soaked in water for 3 hours, sliced thin, and then sautéed with salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, a little vinegar, and lemon. While I haven’t tried the dish, I’d travel almost anywhere for more foie gras, so when I get to Périgord, I might have to engage in this rite of passage as well and report back.\n\nFarci Poitevin - Stuffed Poitevin\n\nIf you search the word “Poitevin,” you may see it is a breed of dog. Happy to say, this is not a dog dish. It is actually more the opposite—the only dish that can sometimes be vegan on our weird foods of France list.\n\nPoitevin is also an ancient French dialect, and this peasant dish hailing from the Poitou-Charentes region boasts ancient roots as well.\n\nWhat began as a humble way to use vegetable leftovers has evolved into a regional specialty. What could go wrong with cabbage, spinach, sorrel, onions, and herbs? The issue most people have with it is the presentation.\n\nIf you eat with your eyes first, you may gag before you take a bite. Some versions are so bad they resemble what may come out of the rear of a dog. But, luckily, that’s as close as you’ll come to eating canine in France.\n\nTartare de Boeuf - Steak Tartare\n\nTartare refers to a group of Mongols known to eat raw meat, and that is exactly what Tartare de Boeuf refers to, raw beef.\n\nTruth be told, every time I eat steak tartare I enjoy it. Yet, I rarely order it. As a chef, who spent years temping beef to adhere to Health Department standards, it freaks me out just a bit. In France, I’m definitely in the minority.\n\nFrom my culinary experiences in the country, I can assure you that the French adore this traditional French food. I’d even go out on a limb and say I’ve seen more people order steak tartare than any other dish. When you see so many people eating this beauty, I hope you’ll be tempted to try it too.\n\nWhat makes it palatable, and even delicious, is the combination of seasonings and other flavoring ingredients like Worcestershire sauce, onions, black pepper, capers, and sometimes mushrooms, that are mixed with the beef. Don’t be surprised to receive a raw egg yolk on top as well.\n\nLes Tripes - Tripe\n\nI don’t want to discourage you from trying tripe if you haven’t tried it already, but I’ll go on record as saying I’m not a fan. It has nothing to do with it being the stomach of a cow and has everything to do with the texture and flavor.\n\nThat being said, there are three very popular tripe dishes from France to choose from—if you can stomach them. The first, from the cuisine of Nice, Tripes à la Niçoise, simmers tripe in a white wine and tomato sauce. From Lyon, we have Tripes à la Lyonnaise with bacon and onions. But the overwhelmingly most beloved tripe recipe comes from Normandy.\n\nLegend has it that the recipe for Tripes à la Mode de Caen dates back to the 11th century. How does cow stomach with cider, Calvados, carrots, and onions sound? Can you really pass up the opportunity to try a French dish invented by William the Conqueror’s chef?"
