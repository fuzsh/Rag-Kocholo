        "text": "We know what you may be thinking: I've had pigs in a blanket a million times before. While this party appetizer might seem straight forward, our recipe truly nails it. We added an extra ingredient to this last-minute app that may seem basic, but really takes this recipe over-the-top in our book. Whether you make them completely classic or with a creative twist, follow our top tips to ace this staple snack for all your get-togethers, from your Christmas party to New Year's Eve celebration.\n\nHow to make the best pigs in a blanket:\n\nOur secret to taking pigs in a blanket from good to great? A sprinkle of coarse salt on top gives these bites an extra boost of flavor, reminiscent of another fave party snack of oursâ€”homemade pretzels. That being said, you don't have to stop at just a sprinkle of salt. We're big fans of topping ours with everything bagel seasoning (like these everything bagel dogs) or brushing with garlic butter before baking. Alternatively, sprinkle on some poppy seeds, sesame seeds (white and black would make for a nice presentation), granulated onion, or shredded Parmesan. These little guys are kind of a blank slate, ready to be topped with any of your favorite seasonings!\n\nWhat can I use instead of crescent dough?\n\nThere's something very classic about crescent dough, so we tend to gravitate toward it, but puff pastry or even biscuit dough would work in this recipe. If you're using puff pastry, make sure to build in enough time for it to thaw since you typically buy it frozen.\n\nCan I use hot dogs for pigs in a blanket?\n\nGood news! You can totally use regular hot dogs for pigs in a blanket. Just cut your hot dogs into quarters and proceed with the recipe as is. You can even use different types of sausage: try a spicy andouille or an herby chicken sausage. Just make you're buying the precooked stuff.\n\nThe best dipping sauces to serve:\n\nWhen it comes to dips, nothing beats a good grainy mustard. Other dip options include (but are certainly not limited to) ketchup, aioli, BBQ sauce, or even ranch dressing.\n\nMade them? Let us know how it went in the comment section below!"
