        "text": "You may have heard the news, but if not, take a seat… the origin of French toast has pretty much nothing to do with France! Throughout many countries, eras, and name changes, the French toast we know today had a start much different from what you may think.\n\nThis beloved breakfast food found around the world can be traced back to the Roman Empire. In fact, the French called it “pain a la Romaine,” or Roman toast before it gained its current name. If you think about it, bread was invented in around 5000 B.C.E. in Ancient Egypt, so the chance of French toast becoming a thing even before the Romans was a possibility. Someone must have realized dipping bread in a variety of delicious liquids was a good idea much sooner. Either way, French toast has history!\n\nThe actual term for French toast goes back to at least 17th century England. Early settlers brought the term and the recipe with them to America where it continued to spread in popularity. To this day in France, they call it “pain perdu” which means “lost bread.” This was because people originally made French toast from stale bread as a final use before throwing it away. This was especially true throughout Europe in the Middle Ages so that peasants could avoid the inconceivable act of wasting food. The affluent would eat the dish as well, just with a more excessive set of ingredients and toppings.\n\nWhether you enjoy French toast for breakfast as we typically see it here in America, or as a dessert or holiday meal, most of the world can agree that French toast is something to be desired. Stuffed, savory, or sweet, there are unlimited flavor options. Come to the Committed Pig and try one of our French toast variations today!"
