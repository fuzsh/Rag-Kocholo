        "text": "It’s safe to say that Michael Fassbender has had a pretty good couple of years. In 2008, the Irish-German actor commanded the screen in Steve McQueen’s controversial prison drama Hunger, for which he lost some unspeakable amount of weight to play an IRA prisoner on a hunger strike. Then, he showed up in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds as a British agent/film buff posing as a Nazi officer, a part that required him to play a dry, stiff-upper-lip Brit and speak fluent German. And now he can be seen in Andrea Arnold’s touching working-class drama, Fish Tank (a cause célèbre at the same Cannes Film Festival that Basterds premiered at last year), as the charming and seemingly kind boyfriend of the troubled heroine’s mom. All three roles are remarkably different, but Fassbender brings his unforgettable, palpable presence to all of them. He met with us in Soho during a recent trip to New York.\n\nYour character in Fish Tank does some pretty awful things, and yet the film depicts him very even-handedly. He’s a charming guy, and he remains likable even after we learn all these bad things about him.\n\nConnor is charming. He does a lot of positive things. He’s the only one who tells Mia that she has a talent, that she is special and should follow her dreams. She’s not getting that at home. She needs someone to teach her to have some self-esteem, and he does that. He does care for her, outside of a sexual nature. He finds her an interesting person. She’s a fighter. That’s what attracts him to her at first. The fact that the film doesn’t judge Connor was what made me want to work with Andrea. Having seen [her first feature] Red Road — that’s what I like about her characters, they’re ambiguous, she doesn’t make it easy for an audience by saying: “This is your hero, and this is your villain.” She brings these characters to life onscreen in a really non-judgmental way.\n\nWas that balance something you had to work on a lot?\n\nI just kind of knew, from talking to Andrea, what she wanted. After a while, you get a sense of the director. I didn’t have a script. None of the actors had a full script: Every Friday, we would get the following week’s work, and we did it in chronological order. I thought, she must be doing that because she doesn’t want me to preload this character, knowing what’s going to come later. So I decided to keep him fairly charming, fairly light. The character is a lot like me in some ways. Andrea casts pretty close to the personality she thinks she’s portraying. And the character’s actions will decipher the kind of person that they are. So I just tried to respond to what was going on and to allow things to take place.\n\nLike Bobby Sands, your character in Hunger, this is also a very physical role. Are you drawn to those kinds of parts?\n\nEvery role requires physicality in a way. Even with Inglourious Basterds — I studied George Sanders and how he carried himself, the elegance and preciseness of his demeanor. I tried to embody that whole time period in the bearing of that character. But yes, physicality is very important to me. In theater, you’re used to working from the feet up, but in a lot of TV and film you become just head and shoulders. I like to start from the ground up. And I knew Andrea wanted Connor to have a very sexual presence. He comes into this female-dominated world, and I knew that his presence had to be sexually potent.\n\nSo, after what you had to go through in Hunger, losing a ton of weight and playing a character who is constantly beaten and humiliated, does every subsequent role seem like a piece of cake?\n\nNo. I get nervous and I worry before every film. I thoroughly enjoyed making Hunger. The subject matter was intense, so people always ask me about how difficult it must have been. But we had a lot of fun, actually. The scary part about Hunger that we all worried about was the long conversation with the priest, when they’re just sitting there talking: We felt if we got that right, then the rest of the film was in good stead.\n\nThe scene with the priest in Hunger is an incredibly long scene of people sitting at a table talking — much like the tavern scene in Inglourious Basterds. And both scenes are riveting. How do you make something like that work?\n\nA good director. [Laughs] I think the secret is very simple, and we talked about this a lot on Hunger: It’s to not perform. To actually just listen to what the other person is saying. Once you do that, then the whole thing sort of falls into place. But if you’re just sitting there worrying, “Holy shit, what do I say next, when do I say it?” and so on, that’s a problem. When you’re doing really heavy dialogue-based stuff, you have to find a way to relax and to just listen and respond."
