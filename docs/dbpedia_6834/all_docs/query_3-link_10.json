        "text": "Katie Jarvis, who plays Mia, had never acted before this film. A casting director spotted her having a fight with her boyfriend at a train station and offered her the role.\n\nThe film was shot chronologically, and the actors were shown only the part of the script they would be filming the following week - none of them knew what would happen to their characters later in the film.\n\nEarly in the film, Mia's little sister Tyler say to Conor \"I like you.. I'll kill you last.\" This is a quote Arnold Schwarzenegger says in the 1985 film \"Commando.\"\n\nIncluded among the \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", edited by Steven Schneider."
