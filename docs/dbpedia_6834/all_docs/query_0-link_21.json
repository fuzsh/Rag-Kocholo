        "text": "BBC Films is the feature film-making arm of the BBC. It was founded in 1990,[1] and has produced or co-produced some of the most successful British films of recent years, including Truly, Madly, Deeply, Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, Quartet, Chef, Testament of Youth, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, My Week with Marilyn, Jane Eyre, The Moblee Movie, 3Txulo: The Film, In the Loop, An Education, StreetDance 3D, Fish Tank, Nativity!, Iris, Notes on a Scandal and Billy Elliot.\n\nBBC Films co-produces around eight films a year, working in partnership with major international and UK distributors. Christine Langan is Head of BBC Films, responsible for the development and production slate, strategy and business operations.[2]\n\nBBC Films has been based at Broadcasting House in London since 2013.[3] Prior to 2007, it was based nearby in Mortimer Street, while still under full control of the BBC. A restructuring of the division integrated it into the main BBC Fiction department of BBC Vision. As a result, it moved out of its independent offices into BBC Television Centre, and its head David M. Thompson left to start his own film production company.[4]"
