        "text": "The steampunk movement first emerged on the scene in the 1970s, a little before the term was officially coined in 1987 by author K W Jetter in a letter to Locus Magazine. Having set its roots in the world of writing, the steampunk movement soon seeped into other worlds such as art, fashion, music, and of course, film. With some great works out there that ought no to be missed, we’ve compiled this list of our top 20 Steampunk movies.\n\nWhat is Steampunk?\n\nSo what exactly is Steampunk? It is essentially, the collision of two worlds, or two points in time. Heavily based on the Victorian era, Steampunk fuses classic themes and styles from the 19th century such as top hats, flying goggles, classic interiors and looks, with the notion of an accelerated technological advance in steam powered devices and classic engineering of the time. The result? Vintage yet futuristic looking devices often with visible movings cogs and parts. Fashions based on Victorian looks but incorporating brass gadgets. Places in time that feel like a mixture of both the past and the future.\n\nThe whole Steampunk genre, which stems off from the cyberpunk genre, is based on the ideas of what people in the victorian age may have envisioned the future to look like. When it comes to plots, one of three themes generally applies, but brassy, steam powered machines are usually at the core of it all.\n\nWhat Makes a Great Steampunk Movie?\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Steampunk genre is generally defined by certain plot themes. A good Steampunk movie is likely to either be set in 19th century Victorian times playing out an alternative history, be set in a fantasy world in which steam powered technology rather than modern day electronics are dominant, or be set in an apocalyptic future where steam technology still rules.\n\nThere are of course other examples of plots, but the best indicator of a great Steampunk movie are the aesthetics, from the Victorian clothing to the gadgets and imaginative steam engineering. A compelling Steampunk movie will impress you by presenting a captivating parallel world.\n\nThe Best Steampunk Movies\n\nSo whether you’re new to the world of Steampunk, or you specifically came here in search of this list, we will now present 20 of our top Steampunk movies and what makes them so great.\n\n1.
