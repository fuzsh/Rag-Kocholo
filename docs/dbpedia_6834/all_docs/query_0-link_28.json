        "text": "My core field is the cultural, socio-political and contextual understanding of contemporary British film and film culture since the 1970s, spanning films with both period and contemporary settings – including bringing the perspectives and insights of audiences and fans into debates which have historically excluded them. I am know especially for:\n\n(i) My contributions since the mid-1990s to the debates around the cultural politics of the ‘heritage film’ (defined by Richard Dyer as 'a text set in the past’, often ‘drawing upon a canonical source’, and ‘comprised of period costumes, decor and locations carefully recreated’). Recently, I’ve been called a ‘key voice’ in the shaping of these debates. Read more in a 2013 interview about my work in this area here: http://arts.leeds.ac.uk/screeningeuropeanheritage/956\n\n(ii) My wider socially and contextually situated work on contemporary representations in British film, 1990–present, with particular reference to the politics – cultural, socio-economic, sexual and representational – of the Thatcher and Blair eras. Here, my interests encompass class, gender, sexuality and their intersections; shifting social realisms; transnational representations and directors within British cinema (e.g. Pawel Pawlikowski); socio-economic, historical, urban and regional geographies and questions of place; and discourses and representations of regeneration and decline.\n\n(iii) Other interests include ‘pre-heritage’ British period cinema and TV drama in long 1970s; 1970s–1980s punk and post-punk music cultures and their impacts on British film; post-2000 trends in the ‘retro’ or historical representation of recent, late-20th-century decades in film and media in convergence with wider cultural, music and style trends; and new trends in the mediated representation of history/‘the past’ considered in relation to digitised archives and social media.\n\nMy research and publications across this spectrum contributed to DMU’s world-class research submissions to RAE2001 (UoA65), RAE2008 (UoA66), and our outstanding triumph in REF2014 (UoA36), in which we were ranked No. 1 in the UK in our subject area for 4*/world-leading outputs, and joint 1st in the UK for impact. I am always happy to hear from prospective PhD students seeking supervision in my fields of expertise.\n\nMy work on ‘heritage cinema’ (and especially the films of Merchant Ivory Productions) has been driven by a commitment to focusing attention on questions of gender, sexuality and pleasure, in a counterpoint to the overemphasis on nostalgia and ‘ideologies of Englishness’ which dominated the most influential critiques of these films from the early 1990s onwards.\n\nMy more recent work has returned to ‘heritage films’ as viewed from the perspectives of real audiences and fans: represented in the monograph Heritage Film Audiences: Period Films and Contemporary Audiences in the UK (Edinburgh University Press, HB 2011, PB 2012) – to date, the only detailed empirical study of audience perspectives on heritage films or heritage culture – and its refereed-journal sequel ‘Heritage Film Audiences 2.0’, which explores the forms and implications of (time-shifted, transnational) 21st-century online fandom and fan productivity, centrally around Ivory’s E. M. Forster adaptations Maurice (1987) and A Room With A View (1985\n\nIn my work in progress, I’m increasingly interested in the connections and parallels between these perspectives and the insights yielded by textual histories and production studies.\n\nIn 2012, I was one of only 26 UK academics – and 9 UK female academics – then below Professor or Emeritus level invited to contribute to Sight & Sound’s famous once-a-decade Greatest Films of All Time Poll of leading critics and filmmakers worldwide.\n\nConferences and panels as organiser\n\nPeer-review and hosting committee: Console-ing Passions: 21st International Conference on Television, Video, Audio, New Media and Feminism, DMU, 23-25 Jun 2013.\n\nPanel organiser: ‘E.
