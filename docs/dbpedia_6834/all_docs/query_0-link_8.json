Audience: • Classification: 15 years of age, due to use of strong language. • Target audience: 35-40 year olds (critics) • FishTank doesn't’t appeal to a worldwide audience (such asAmerica) due to people from other countries not being to relate to the situation because people do not know about the estate side of London.\n\n4. Film makers: • Director &Writer: AndreaArnold • Producers: Kess Kassander & Nick Laws • Composer: Phonso Martin • Cinematographer: Robbie Ryan • Editor: Nicolas Chaudeurge • Casting Director: JillTrevellick • Production Designer: Helen Scott\n\n5. Storyline: • Mia, an aggressive fifteen-year-old girl, lives on an Essex estate with her tarty mother, Joanne, and precocious little sisterTyler. She has been thrown out of school and is awaiting admission to a referrals unit and spends her days aimlessly. She begins an uneasy friendship with Joanne's slick boyfriend, Connor, who encourages her one interest, dancing.\n\n6.

Marketing: • FishTank used film festivals to advertise there film. • The trailer was also a way of marketing. • Online websites were used for a wider range of advertising. • Posters were also used for advertising. For example: as seen below…\n\n11. Social Realism: • Social realism is a genre of film.This specific genre focuses on issues such as: drugs, money, alcohol, dysfunctional families & prostitution ect that are in modern society. Social realism also uses the theme of class, religion & political views. • FishTank explores the theme of dysfunctional families and alcohol within the genre of social realism throughout.\n\n12. Issued raised with national and local audiences: • FishTank: • Four weddings & a funeral: • Avatar:\n\n13. FishTank issues: • Due to the film ‘FishTank’ having unknown actors the audience would be smaller & it would be hard to have a national audience because people will not know the actors therefore they will not have their own fan base (likeAmerican, Hollywood films). • The genre of social realism is portrayed throughout the film ‘FishTank’ therefore it would not appeal to other countries outside of London because the estate side of London is not known. For example: Americans wouldn’t know about conditions in east London. • For ‘FishTank’ the location is in east London (Tilbury).This is clearly shown through the film as it shows theThames &Queen Elizabeth bridge, therefore the location could not be anywhere else but London.\n\n14. Four weddings & a funeral issues: • The film Four weddings and a funeral was focused on middle class people, therefore it had a bigger audience than the film FishTank as it appealed more to national audiences. • One issue raised about this film was the name ‘Four weddings and a funeral’. • Due to the film being about weddings, everyone can relate to the film, instantly gaining a bigger audience. • Four weddings and a funeral also had more well known stars in the film, for example: Hugh Grant,Andie MacDowell & RowanAtkinson ect. Meaning that people who like these actors/actresses will be attracted to watching the film as they already have their own fan base, where as the film FishTank used unknown actors/actresses."
