        "text": "I am having fish disappear in my tanks. It says they're still there if I \"Open\" the tank... But they're invisible. It will only show them if I manually remove them from the tank then re-add them. They disappear any time I leave the lot.\n\nNo, I am *not* in laptop mode. I have the setting off as I'm in a pretty high powered desk PC. I'm able to run the game smoothly as far as graphics go with settings almost all the way up. Turning them down did not fix the problem.\n\nIs anyone else having this specific problem?\n\nI have already tried repairing my game files multiple times. I do have mods, but none that affect fish, pets or anything like that.\n\nProduct: The Sims 4\n\nPlatform:PC\n\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\n\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\n\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.83.24.1030\n\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? University, island living, get famous, seasons, cats and dogs, get together, get to work. Realm of magic, strangerville, jungle adventure, parenthood, vampires, dine out, outdoor retreat. Paranormal, laundry day, toddler, bowling night, backyard, kids room, romantic garden, movie hangout, spooky.\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Place a fish in a fishtank or bowl and it is invisible. It says the fish is inside but it cannot be seen. It does not matter if it is caught or bought. Place a frog on any surface and you can only see a clear tank and the frogs eyes.\n\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? Fish cannot be seen inside the fish tanks or bowls. Everything inside frog tanks is invisible except for the frogs eyes.\n\nWhat do you expect to see? The fish in tanks and bowls and the entire frog should be visible.\n\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Never used.\n\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n\nâ€Œ\n\nFish and frogs are not visible in tanks"
