Sadly, healthcare workers worldwide are often not getting the protection they need from airborne disease, such as the current swine flu. In this current swine flu outbreak, CDC began suggesting that surgical masks will do to protect healthcare workers (without the nylon stockings mentioned in this song). Much evidence regarding airborne transmission and the need for true respirators has accumulated since this video was made. A recent report by the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) Respiratory Protection for Healthcare Workers in the Workplace against Novel H1N1 Influenza A supports that health care workers who interact with patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with novel H1N1 influenza A should wear fitted N95 respirators, which filter better than looser medical masks.
