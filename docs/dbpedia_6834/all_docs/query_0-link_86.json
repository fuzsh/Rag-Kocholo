        "text": "Not all mermaids are like Ariel in \"The Little Mermaid.\" Though Disney conditioned us to think that mermaids are bubbly creatures who hardly know what to do with a dinglehopper, some mermaids in fiction are much, much different. In lore, mermaids are half human, half sea creature and date back thousands of years. In some tales, mermaids are portrayed as vicious sirens who use their beauty and allure to draw people — usually men — toward them and kill them. But like any mythical creature, the stories have changed over generations, giving many faces to what mermaids can be.\n\nThough Ariel in \"The Little Mermaid\" is one of the most notable of her kind, there are plenty of mermaids in other films who serve as main and side characters. All the iterations of \"Peter Pan\" have life-saving mermaids in them, though they only play a small role in the overall story, whereas movies like \"Aquamarine\" base the whole story around a mermaid.\n\nIf you're a fan of mermaids and looking for a mermaid movie for your next night in (perhaps as you wait for Halle Bailey's very own turn as Ariel in \"The Little Mermaid\"), there are actually quite a few films in this aquatic category to choose from. Spanning decades, these mermaid movies cover a number of genres. From thrilling mermaid movies that lean into the siren theme to romantic love stories involving these magical maidens, there's really no limit to how far this mythical creature can go. Heck, there are even a couple mockumentaries that might just make you believe mermaids are real.\n\nNeedless to say, \"The Little Mermaid\" is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to mermaid media. If you really want to expand your horizons, check out these 31 mermaid movies ahead.\n\n01\n\n\"The Little Mermaid\"\n\nThe classic Disney animated film follows a young mermaid named Ariel (Jodi Benson) who desperately wants to live on land. After catching a glimpse of the handsome Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes), she instantly falls for him — and he feels the same. Her father, King Triton (Kenneth Mars), isn't supportive of her wishes, so she makes a deal with Ursula (Pat Carroll), the sea witch, to live on land. Ariel agrees to trade her voice for legs, losing both her fins and her ability to sing or talk at all. Now she has to convince Eric she's the one he's been pining for — all without being able to sing her siren song to him.\n\n02\n\n\"The Mermaid: Lake of the Dead\"\n\nIn this suspenseful thriller, Roma (Efim Petrunin) stumbles upon a beautiful woman in a lake and is drawn to her. They share a kiss, and Roma leaves. However, after their kiss, Roma's life begins to spiral out of control. Despite kissing the mysterious mermaid of the lake, Roma is still tied to his girlfriend, Marina (Viktoriya Agalakova), who has no intention of letting him go. But the mermaid's kiss set a curse in motion to bring Roma back to the water, where he'll never be able to leave her. Once she sets her sights on someone, she'll stop at nothing to claim him.\n\n03\n\n\"Lu Over the Wall\"\n\nIn this sweet Japanese animated movie, Lu is a mermaid with unique powers. When she sings, she can make people dance, which is exactly what Kai needs in his life. Kai is new to Tokyo and isn't quick to make new friends. However, one day, he's asked by a few of his classmates to play the keyboard in their band. This draws Lu to them, causing her to sing along with the music they play and make anyone who hears it dance along. Kai's taken by her when they meet, and the two form a fast friendship as he starts to open up to her.\n\n04\n\n\"Night Tide\"\n\nWhile on shore leave, Johnny Drake (Dennis Hopper) meets Mora (Linda Lawson), a woman who spends her time posing as a mermaid on the boardwalk. Her life as a fake mermaid might be more real than either of them think, though. She tells Johnny she believes she's a true siren, like the mermaids of the deep, and Johnny almost starts to believe that Mora's two dead boyfriends were a result of something she'd done. Johnny isn't sure if he should grow wary of the beautiful young woman or not, but when he almost drowns at (what he assumes to be) her hands, he can't help but wonder what's true.\n\n05\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\"\n\nIn yet another installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) past catches up with him when he meets Angelica (Penélope Cruz) — a beautiful pirate he once loved. They collect Blackbeard (Ian McShane) on his ship and set off together for the Fountain of Youth. Of course, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is also in the chase for the legendary landmark, and the race won't be pretty.

But rather than drown or simply sink to their deaths, they're saved by a community of mermaids who preserve their souls, preventing them from ever being forgotten. This beautiful fantasy story by Gabrielle Tesfaye brings light and hope to the topic of entrapment and slavery and paints mermaids in a positive and helpful light, something that not all mermaid stories do. Rather than be sirens luring people the wrong way, these mermaids provide a beacon of light.\n\n09\n\n\"Beach Blanket Bingo\"\n\nA lot goes down in this 1965 party film. Sugar Kane (Linda Evans) is caught up in a scandal that she's mostly unaware of and is being used for publicity stunts, like fake skydiving.

Crystal, who is also part mermaid, warns her of mermaid hunters who might be out to get them.\n\n13\n\n\"Mermaids: The Body Found\"\n\nThis mockumentary is a fictionalized story of what it could be like for mermaids to exist. Actors portray scientists discussing findings in the deep sea about life that resembles mermaids. Told almost in the style of found footage, the scenes are cut together with input from the scientists discussing the great unknown that lies beneath the water and analyzing what could possibly be on this footage. The film, which aired on Animal Planet, was actually so believable that some viewers were angry at being duped. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable piece of fiction that provides a good laugh at the mysteries of the ocean.\n\n14\n\n\"The Thirteenth Year\"\n\nIn this Disney Channel Original Movie, Cody Griffin (Chez Starbuck) starts to go through some serious changes when he hits his teen years.

However, when mermaids — or mermen in this case — become teenagers, their aquatic transformation begins, forcing Cody to adjust quickly to his newfound life.\n\n15\n\n\"The Mermaid\"\n\n\"The Mermaid\" is a classic tale of falling in love with the wrong person. Liu Xuan (Deng Chao) buys a wildlife reserve that requires sonar technology to raze the area, which will wipe out the merpeople currently living there. The thing is, Xuan doesn't seem bothered. Shan (Lin Yun) is sent by her fellow merpeople to kill Xuan to prevent the erasure of her kinfolk. Unlike all merpeople, Shan is able to blend in with humans because of her unique ability to use her fins like feet. But when she actually meets Xuan, she accidentally falls in love with him — and the feeling is mutual.\n\n16\n\n\"A Mermaid's Tale\"\n\nRyan (Caitlin Carmichael) feels like her life might be over because she has to move to a sleepy coastal town with her dad, Matt (Jerry O'Connell).

Cam (William Moseley) and his young niece Elle (Loreto Peralta) discover a mermaid named Elizabeth (Poppy Drayton) trapped in a tank at the circus. Supposedly, her water heals all ailments, which Cam hopes to use for Elle, who is sick. However, he fears it's not true and that Elizabeth isn't actually a mermaid, especially when he meets her again in the woods. But while the mermaid water may not be working as planned, Elizabeth truly is a mermaid who's trapped, and Cam and Elle can help her find a way out.\n\n18\n\n\"The Lure\"\n\nThis Polish film tells the thrilling story of two mermaids, Silver (Marta Mazurek) and Golden (Michalina Olszańska), who escape their watery homes to dance in a nightclub. They start by just dancing and singing backup for other acts before they realize they're quite the catch on their own. They form an act called The Lure, and that's where things start to go off the rails. There's murder, lust, betrayal, and absolutely no possibility that anyone will get a happy ending in this off-the-wall horror film. At least the scenes with The Lure on stage are relatively mild and not too bloody.\n\n19\n\n\"Magic Island\"\n\nIt's not been easy for teenager Jack (Zachery Ty Bryan). Determined to run away and find a new life, Jack sets his mind to making it happen. Before he can, his nanny hands him a magic book and tells him to just read it before he makes any decisions.

Forced to fight for their lives, the duo do everything in their power to try to overcome their aquatic foe.\n\n26\n\n\"Miranda\"\n\nMiranda the mermaid (Glynis Johns) is every bit the siren you'd imagine a mermaid to be. She meets Paul (Griffith Jones) while he's on holiday without his wife. Miranda hooks herself onto Paul's fishing line and drags him down into the water to keep him prisoner. She agrees to let him go if he takes her home to London with him. With no other option, he agrees, but he has to figure out how to disguise the mermaid so no one will know what's going on.

Can the quiet woman help him, or will he remain imprisoned?\n\n28\n\n\"A Mermaid in Paris\"\n\nThough \"A Mermaid in Paris\" seems like it could be a cheesy movie with an off-the-wall premise, it's actually a quietly lovely story. Gaspard (Nicolas Duvauchelle) is a man who has pretty much given up on finding love until he encounters a beautiful mermaid on a street in Paris. Lula (Marilyn Lima) is barely clinging to life when Gaspard whisks her away to his home and puts her in a tub.

Now Charlotte has to navigate what comes next for her and her family, all while being pulled from every side to use her powers for all the wrong things.\n\n31\n\n\"Mermaids: The New Evidence\"\n\nThe follow-up to \"Mermaids: The Body Found\" was a little more clear to viewers that it was yet again a mockumentary, yet it's thrilling and enjoyable all the same. Animal Planet brings back the scientists involved in the first installment of the mockumentary to discuss new findings since the last entry. Dr. Paul Robertson (David Evans) shares new footage of mermaids in the deep blue sea and what he and fellow researchers have been able to learn about the underwater world they inhabit. Despite how wild this mockumentary is, the ratings were astronomical for Animal Planet. If you enjoyed the first film, you definitely don't want to miss this one."
