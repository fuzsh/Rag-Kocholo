13. FishTank issues: • Due to the film ‘FishTank’ having unknown actors the audience would be smaller & it would be hard to have a national audience because people will not know the actors therefore they will not have their own fan base (likeAmerican, Hollywood films). • The genre of social realism is portrayed throughout the film ‘FishTank’ therefore it would not appeal to other countries outside of London because the estate side of London is not known. For example: Americans wouldn’t know about conditions in east London. • For ‘FishTank’ the location is in east London (Tilbury).This is clearly shown through the film as it shows theThames &Queen Elizabeth bridge, therefore the location could not be anywhere else but London.

14. Four weddings & a funeral issues: • The film Four weddings and a funeral was focused on middle class people, therefore it had a bigger audience than the film FishTank as it appealed more to national audiences. • One issue raised about this film was the name ‘Four weddings and a funeral’. • Due to the film being about weddings, everyone can relate to the film, instantly gaining a bigger audience. • Four weddings and a funeral also had more well known stars in the film, for example: Hugh Grant,Andie MacDowell & RowanAtkinson ect. Meaning that people who like these actors/actresses will be attracted to watching the film as they already have their own fan base, where as the film FishTank used unknown actors/actresses.
