        "text": "During his visit to Malaysia last month, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said that China was willing to study a plan to connect its projects in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Laos, and Thailand for “enhancing regional connectivity.” Li was at the groundbreaking ceremony for a terminal station of the Kunming to Singapore rail network, through lines across multiple Southeast Asian countries.\n\nThe 665 km-long East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) will connect Kota Bharu in the east with Port Klang located on the strategically important Strait of Malacca on Malaysia’s west coast. It is expected to bring economic benefits through improved connectivity and tourism. Although work began in 2017, it was stalled amid funding constraints. It is now expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nInfrastructure projects to link Southeast Asian countries have been proposed in the past, including during European colonial rule in the region. More recently, the pan-Asian rail network was conceptualized in the form of three links — a western line from Kunming via Myanmar and Thailand, a central line via Laos and Thailand,and an eastern line via Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. Another line would connect Thailand’s capital, Bangkok,with Malaysia and Singapore, which sits at the mouth of the Malacca Strait. Around 30% of global trade passes through this strait.\n\nWhat is the rail network’s current status?\n\nThe project has faced roadblocks for multiple reasons. Only the Laos-China section has been operational since 2021. Like Malaysia, Thailand has also faced problems with high costs and has been wary of taking assistance from China. The project is expected to be completed in 2028, but may be delayed. Doubts have been raised over the projected economic gains as well. Jonathan E. Hillman, a political economist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), argued in his book “The Emperor’s New Road: China and the Project of the Century” (2020), that the width of the tracks across these countries varies, making seamless cargo transportation challenging.\n\nThere are concerns over demand as well. “Most people traveling from Kunming to Singapore would still prefer to fly, which will remain cheaper and faster. Likewise, cargo shuttled between the two destinations would be cheaper if transported first to the coast, and then by boat to Singapore. Most studies have found that a pan-Asian rail system would complement maritime shipping rather than compete with it,” Hillman wrote.\n\nWhat are China’s interests here?\n\nHillman noted that plans for the rail link project predate President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao mentioned it at the ASEAN summit in 2007. But “despite missing deadlines, China has made the pan-Asian railway an even more central part of its regional engagement,” he wrote.\n\nChina has direct influence in Southeast Asia on account of geography and stronger economic and cultural ties. According to the Chinese government, “In 2023, the trade volume between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) reached USD 911.7 billion.” This made them each other’s largest trading partners for the fourth year. With the BRI, these ties can be further strengthened. China has emerged as a provider of loans for infrastructure projects in countries historically lacking them, despite apprehensions about their financing.\n\nChina’s aggressive moves and territorial claims in the South China Sea have also made many countries in the region nervous, and Beijing hopes to leverage economic ties to develop goodwill and trust. It has rejected accusations of practicing “debt trap diplomacy,” which involves providing loans at high interest rates and then seizing control of strategic assets when the debtor countries fail to pay back."
