        "text": "US$10bn Project to Connect China-Singapore Railway Unveiled by Chinese Premier\n\nChina’s Premier Li Qiang has announced an ambitious US$10 billion project to link thousands of kilometres of railways from Malaysia to China, through Thailand and Laos, culminating in a connection to Singapore. This announcement was made during his three-day official visit to Malaysia, marking the 50th anniversary of China-Malaysia diplomatic relations, according to Reuters on 19 June 2024.\n\nDuring the event, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said, “China is willing to study the ambitious expansion plan for the East Railway. “Malaysia’s US$10 billion Coast Rail Link (ECRL) to other Chinese-backed railway projects in Laos and Thailand that could extend Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative across Southeast Asia.”\n\n“The project proposal will make the Pan-Asia Central Railway, which runs from the southern Chinese city of Kunming to Singapore, a reality,” Li emphasised.\n\nSpeaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the 665-kilometre ECRL, which aims to connect Malaysia’s eastern peninsula and west coast by the end of 2026, Li highlighted the project’s potential to “build new international land and sea trade corridors, enhance regional connectivity, and deepen the ASEAN community.”\n\nThe Malaysian government has indicated a willingness to consider expanding these Chinese-backed projects to its border with Thailand.\n\nPremier Li’s visit to Malaysia follows his trips to New Zealand and Australia, reflecting China’s broader strategy to enhance its influence and investment in the Asia-Pacific region amid ongoing challenges with the United States.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur, Premier Li met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya. Following a closed-door meeting, both leaders witnessed the signing of several agreements, including the extension of the “Five-Year China-Malaysia Cooperation Program” initiated in 2013 and set to continue until 2028. This program aims to foster cooperation in trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure, and financial services."
