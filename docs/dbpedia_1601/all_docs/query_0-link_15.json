        "text": "“China is willing to work with Malaysia to actively study the East Coast Railway, connect the middle section of the China-Laos Railway and take the Pan-Asia Railway Central Line from concept to reality.”\n\nBut the project was shelved temporarily when a new Malaysian administration sought to revise the cost downwards as the country grappled with revelations of surging national debt, partly blamed on the multibillion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\n\nWednesday’s launch event marked the start of the final leg of construction of the 655km ECRL, where the rail line enters the west coast via the district of Gombak in Selangor, Malaysia’s richest and most industrialised state.\n\nAnwar said the ECRL in its current form was proof of China being “great collaborators” for regional development, as the ambitious rail project gathers steam after a series of delays.\n\n“I think at the rate we are going, this comprehensive strategic partnership with China … is a showcase of how China can be great collaborators in the economic field and all fields of human development,” Anwar said in his speech.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Malaysia and China renewed a five-year economic and trade pact and expanded cooperation across sectors such as green technology and cross-border crime, marking Li’s first official visit to the Southeast Asian nation in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.\n\nAnwar described Li’s visit as an “important milestone” in Malaysia-China relations, and also extended his “profound thanks and appreciation” to China’s President Xi Jinping for his support in seeing through the ECRL project.\n\nThe integrated terminal in Gombak district will serve as the terminus point for passenger traffic on the ECRL and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026.\n\nThe ECRL route will extend further to Port Klang for cargo delivery, with the last leg of the project expected to be completed by December 2027, according to a joint statement by project owner Malaysia Rail Link and main contractor China Communications Construction Co (CCCC).\n\nThe project, initially valued at 55 billion ringgit (US$11.6 billion), was among a slew of BRI deals that Malaysia has taken on in a bid to supercharge its economic growth.\n\nMalaysia, however, suspended the project after voters dumped the administration of then-prime minister Najib Razak, who was accused of using billions of dollars in Chinese investments to plug financial holes caused by the financially ruinous 1MDB scandal.\n\nThe suspension was part of a broad recalibration of Chinese investments in Malaysia at the time. The government then cancelled three pipeline projects being built by China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering at a total cost of US$1.8 billion.\n\nThe ECRL resumed in 2019, with the government and the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) agreeing to a route realignment and a lower cost.\n\nLast month, Malaysia’s Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook floated a plan to link up the ECRL to Thailand’s south by redeveloping a long-defunct rail border crossing in Malaysia’s northern Kelantan state into a key connection point for the Pan-Asian Railway."
