        "text": "What are the true benefits of the Laos-China railway?\n\nThe Laos-China railway, which is scheduled to become operational in December, has become a hot topic of discourse in local and international media as well as on social media over the past few weeks.\n\nThrough these platforms, many people have praised the ability of Laos and China to steer this mega investment project to the final stage, while others have expressed concern about Laos’ mounting public debt because of the Chinese project, as well as over the benefits that Laos will gain from the railway.\n\nAs one of the Lao officials who has been involved in the railway project design and formulation from the outset, I would like to give audiences some facts about the railway investment project and the amount of money which the government has borrowed to finance the project.\n\n(File photo) The Laos-China railway will become operational at the end of this year.\n\nFinally, I will offer my personal views about the benefits that Laos stands to gain from this Laos-China cooperation project, with particular reference to the possibility of Laos falling into the trap of Chinese debt.\n\nTo address the above questions and concerns, first of all I would like to outline the aims of the project, then the method of investment, before concluding with the benefits of the project.\n\nThe railway is a part of China’s Road and Belt Initiative, which aims to increase trade cooperation between China and the rest of the world.\n\nThe Laos-China railway is a part of the Singapore-Kunming rail link. The project was endorsed by Asean leaders at the Asean Summit in 2011, in accordance with the recommendation of the Asean transport ministerial conference at that time.\n\nAs part of efforts to implement the Asean initiative, the Lao and Chinese governments agreed to partner in the construction of the 422.4 km railway, which will run from the Chinese border in Boten to Vientiane.\n\nSo far, about 99 percent of the primary work has been completed. The railway will then connect to the planned Thai railway in Nong Khai before continuing to Bangkok, Malaysia and the terminal station in Singapore.\n\nThe Laos-China railway is being built through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) model, and Government to Government (G to G) mechanism. Through these means, the Lao and Chinese governments established a joint venture with a shareholding ratio of 30-70 percent.\n\nWith this investment formula, many people assumed that the Lao government had to borrow a huge amount of money to secure its 30 percent investment share in the project. This assumption is logical but not 100 percent accurate.\n\nThe truth is that funding for the project is taking place through two separate channels, one being debt financing, which the Laos-China joint venture has to take care of, while the other is equity investment.\n\nThe debt financing involves 60 percent of the total investment amount, which means the joint venture will have to borrow US$3.54 billion from the Chinese government.\n\nUnder this unique investment arrangement, the Lao government did not have to borrow a huge amount of money from China to finance the project as many critics have claimed.\n\nThe actual amount, which the Lao government has to borrow from China for securing the 30 percent proportion of its equity in the project is US$480 million. The rest is the financial contribution from the Lao government, which is about US$250 million.\n\nMaking a judgment based on the small amount of the money that Laos had to borrow from China and the debt financing and equity investment formula, the Lao government will not face the heavy borrowing and investment risks that many critics have expressed concern about.\n\nThe alternative view is that although the debt which the Lao government has taken on is not that great, the government will not be able to deny for the outcome of the railway operation.\n\nThe big question is that what will happen if the Laos-China joint venture is unable to generate sufficient revenue to repay the money borrowed from China.\n\nAlthough this concern is valid, I strongly believe that the joint venture will do its best to generate income to repay the borrowed money because it is the one which borrow the money. And surely, the Chinese government, which holds the majority share, will not let the joint venture run into financial difficulties, thanks to the investment being based on the G-to-G cooperation mechanism.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the lender would seize and take control of the project, which technically belongs to China because it holds 70 percent of project investment. However, I think it is highly unlikely that the project would be taken over under this method of investment.\n\nNow let’s turn to the potential benefits. According to the project feasibility study, the Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) is 6.3 percent over the first 25 years.\n\nThis financial return on investment is quite low compared to the return on investment in other sectors. In my opinion, low return on infrastructure investment is not unusual.\n\nThis does not only take place in a particular country but throughout the world. Indeed, it is rare for a railway operation to make a profit because its purpose is to serve the public and people and it is designed to create a favourable environment for trade and business and support global green growth.\n\nSo what Laos will gain if the financial return on investment is low? I think that although the return is low, the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is 18.5 percent according to the feasibility study.\n\nThe indirect benefits that Laos stands to gain are enhanced economic competitiveness through the transformation of the country from being landlocked to a land link. The railway will enable Laos to serve as a regional logistics hub in the region.\n\nThe railway will not only halve the cost of transport to international markets but will give Lao businesses easier access to the Chinese market of more than 1.3 billion consumers.\n\nThe railway is environmentally friendly as it reduces CO2 emissions 2.5 times compared to petrol-based vehicles. Use of the railway will also help passengers and goods transporters to save money.\n\nFor example, based on an initial estimation, the cost of travel by train from Vientiane to the Chinese border would be just 140,000 kip (360 kip per kilometre per person) while the cost of freight transport is about 600 kip per tonne per km, which is at least two times cheaper than other modes of land transport.\n\nJourney times for both passengers and freight will also be significantly reduced. For example, travel time by bus is usually one day, while travel by diesel train will take about five hours and travel by high-speed rail can be just 90 minutes.\n\nThe low cost, fast travel and freight transport will give a significant boost to the tourism industry. I expect a huge inflow of Chinese tourists in the coming years. There are 70 million people in Yunnan and neighbouring provinces, who have a high purchasing power and wish to travel to nearby countries. In addition, millions of Thai tourists will use the train to travel to China.\n\nWhen completed, the Singapore-Kunming railway will help to promote regional trade. At present, one of the major trade barriers is the cost of transport.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, sea transport has increased by more than 540 percent and accounts for 80 percent of total freight transport in the region.\n\nAs a result of increasing sea transport, the price of Chinese goods in the region has increased by 50 percent over this period. To address these trade obstacles, China and the Asean countries should cooperate to find cheaper modes of transport, especially high-speed railways, which offer cheaper costs.\n\nTo boost bilateral trade, China has agreed to reduce the import taxes for Lao products by 97 percent. This will boost Laos’ exports to China in the near future.\n\nOf course, there are a lot of challenges ahead in order to maximise the benefits of the railway. I think that we have to improve the business climate to attract both Chinese and non-Chinese investment. We also have to invest much more in human resources to accommodate the growing demand for investment.\n\nIn conclusion, because the cost of investment in the railway is divided between debt financing and equity investment, the Lao government should not incur any serious public debt. And the Chinese government will not seize control of the project because it is the majority shareholder. On top of that, China considers the Laos-China railway as part of its hardware in the Road and Belt Initiative.\n\nAlthough the financial returns of the project are low, the railway will undoubtedly increase Laos’ economic competitiveness by transforming the landlocked country into a land bridge. The railway will significantly boost tourism and trade between Laos, China and Thailand. In order to maximise the benefits of the railway, Laos needs to improve human resources to meet the growing needs of the business community.\n\nThe author of this article is Mr Sonesack N.
