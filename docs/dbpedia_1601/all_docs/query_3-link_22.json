        "text": "Its construction has been a colossal undertaking, requiring 150 bridges and more than 70 tunnels, which account for almost 200km of the line. It will have 10 stations in Laos, including one at the former royal capital of Luang Prabang, allowing for both domestic passenger and freight use.\n\nThe US$6 billion cost of the China-Laos railway project is probably what has attracted greatest international attention. About 60 per cent or US$3.5 billion is in the form of borrowing from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nA further 40 per cent, amounting to US$2.4 billion, is being funded with equity in the form of a joint venture company comprising three Chinese state-owned firms and one Laotian state-owned enterprise. The latter enterprise holds a 30 per cent stake. To fund this, the Laotian government committed US$250 million from the national budget and took a second loan of US$480 million from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nThe country’s combined debt exposure to the bank for the railway project is therefore over US$1.5 billion. This is a considerable sum for a country with a nominal GDP of US$20 billion, and official foreign exchange reserves of US$1.1 billion. For the railway to make economic sense, the revenue it generates will need to enable Laos to service these loans.\n\nMore recently, a Lowy Institute study on the impact of the BRI on various countries’ debt levels noted the total debt Laos owed to China was around 45 per cent of its GDP. This exceeded all other countries considered in the study.\n\nLaos actually has very little private sector external debt – around 13 per cent of total external debt as of 2015. But it has higher levels of multilateral debt – 23 per cent of the total – and of bilateral debt, at 64 per cent. Around 60 per cent of this debt is denominated in US dollars, with smaller amounts in yuan, yen, euros and baht.\n\nIn Laos, the greatest concern over the project has probably been adequate compensation for communities adversely affected by construction. Another point of contention is the number of Chinese workers, and conversely the lack of Laotian companies and workers taking part in construction. There are fears about the burgeoning economic clout of the Middle Kingdom and the extent to which the economy is being subsumed by China. The increased presence of Chinese nationals in northern border areas of Laos has also raised concerns.\n\nBut, as China is the largest investor in the country’s modest economy, pragmatism dictates that Laos find ways to absorb and harness Chinese capital, even without considering the close ideological ties between the two leaderships.\n\nA key determinant of the railway’s commercial viability will be the extent to which it can generate new traffic, both cargo and passenger, and particularly transit traffic between China and Thailand. A simple migration of extant traffic and cargo from roads to the new railway line is unlikely to be sufficient.\n\nBut the generation of new traffic will in turn require infrastructure and logistics planning to ensure that the railway is well served by roads, cargo hub points and other platforms to allow Laotian companies can take advantage of the railway. There is a need for policymakers to start thinking about economic corridors, and how best to leverage the new railway line to benefit the provinces through which it will run. There may even be a need to rethink some existing development plans, which will entail discussions with the country’s development partners.\n\nConsiderable lessons can be learned, both good and bad, from other transborder railway and infrastructure projects about how to ensure countries through which they run also benefit.\n\nForecasts of the likely passenger and cargo figures for the railway vary. Some critics argue the figures used in the feasibility study for the railway are too bullish. However, a recent analysis using a geographical simulation model suggests Laos will benefit mostly through passenger traffic, service provision for passengers, and transit-oriented development.\n\nThe World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index shows a broadly similar picture, ranking Laos 82 overall, with clear potential for improvement in areas such as customs, tracking, timeliness of shipments, quality of logistics providers, and others.\n\nIt is also important that the Laotian corporate sector adopt a proactive stance, scoping out business opportunities that will arise from the railway. Having largely missed out on participation in its construction, domestic firms should not adopt a wait-and-see approach. These opportunities can also create openings for small and medium-sized firms. A lack of prior experience of large-scale railway development may hamper Laotian firms, but it does not require too much imagination, innovation and long-term planning to come up with business plans focused on harnessing the impact of the new railway service.\n\nRegardless of the concerns, the arrival of the line is beyond question. The train, as they say, has left the station. The priority now for Laos is to capitalise on it, and derive the best possible return on the investment and debt commitments it has made.\n\nWith the right strategic approach from both the public and private sectors, the railway could prove to be a fillip for Laotian economy, which has for too long been dependent on a few business sectors and development partners. Laos needs to be on board to leverage the railway’s operations as a means to diversify the economy into new areas of business which were not feasible or commercially viable before. But that will not happen organically. It will require planning and execution.\n\nNick Freeman is an independent development consultant, and Associate Fellow in the Myanmar Studies Programme at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.
