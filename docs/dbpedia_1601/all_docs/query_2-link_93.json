        "text": "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged an acceleration in the construction pace of the high-speed railway, part of the ambitious Southeast Asia railway network, this is reported by the railway transport news portal Railway Supply.\n\nWhile Wang Yi did not specify a timeline, the Thai government expects the 873-kilometer section to be operational by 2028.\n\nConstruction of a railway station on the British high-speed rail line HS2\n\nAs part of the “Belt and Road” initiative, supported by President Xi Jinping, China aims to establish a high-speed railway network from Kunming in southwest China to Singapore in the south, passing through Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nHowever, the Thai segment has faced delays due to issues like cost distribution and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring talks with Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha in Bangkok, Wang Yi emphasized the need for swift implementation of the China-Laos-Thailand connectivity concept.\n\nThailand’s authorities report that the first phase of construction from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima is over 15% complete and is expected to be operational by 2027, with the second phase targeted for completion by 2028. In 2016, the\n\nThai section experienced delays when Bangkok rejected Chinese financing due to high interest rates.\n\nSubsequently, Thailand agreed to cover the entire construction cost of 252 kilometers for the first phase, amounting to 179 billion baht (5 billion dollars), with China responsible for system installation, design, train procurement, and the second phase connecting Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai on the Laos border, ultimately linking with China.\n\nRail business, industry, and railway technology news from Railway Supply that you might have missed:\n\nNew CRRC metro trains with five-door carriages have been launched in Hong Kong\n\nFind the latest news of the railway industry in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the rest of the world on our page on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, read Railway Supply magazine online."
