        "text": "According to the GlobalData project database, 248 rail construction projects broke ground across the world in 2022, at a combined cost of over $500bn.\n\nThis is a slight drop when compared to the number of railway construction projects that commenced in 2021 (276). Although the capital expenditure is slightly down – $579.2bn in 2022 compared to $502.3bn the year prior.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Asia dominates the list of rail construction projects, with China featuring most prominently with 50 projects in total last year – 19.9 per cent of the global total. Out of the top 10 projects, only one was in the Middle East and North Africa region.\n\nThe most common type of rail construction project to break ground over the last year was metro, light rail, and rapid transit projects. Almost a third of all railway projects across the globe were metro, light rail, and rapid transit projects, costing a total of over $130.1bn.\n\nOf the top 10 most expensive rail construction projects of 2021, five are located in Asia – showing the continent’s hunger for rail megaprojects. Half of the top ten most expensive rail construction projects in 2022 involve high-speed rail, all of them located in Asia.\n\nHere are the 10 most expensive rail construction projects, according to the GlobalData construction project database, to break ground in 2022.\n\n10.
