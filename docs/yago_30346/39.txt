Starr Manning is a fictional character from the daytime drama One Life to Live. Born onscreen on January 8, 1996, the role was initially portrayed by infant children. In 1998, Starr was rapidly aged when young actress Kristen Alderson debuted in the childhood role, which retconned the character's birth year to 1992.[1] Following the cancellation of One Life to Live and its conclusion in 2012, Alderson carried the role over to ABC's last remaining soap opera, General Hospital, winning a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the portrayal in 2013. Alderson is the second One Life to Live actor after Gerald Anthony (Marco Dane) to win an Emmy for a crossover role to General Hospital.

Starr is the oldest child of Todd Manning and Blair Cramer. Starr is one of the only characters biologically related to both longtime One Life to Live rivals Victoria Lord and Dorian Cramer Lord. The character's most significant storylines featured her dealing with her parents' volatile relationship, her early adolescent friendship with Matthew Buchanan, portrayed by Alderson's real-life brother, Eddie Alderson, and her close friendship with Langston Wilde, as well as her romantic relationships with Cole Thornhart and James Ford on One Life to Live and Michael Corinthos on General Hospital.
