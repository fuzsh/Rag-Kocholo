        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers reveal that Franco Baldwin (Roger Howarth) may have lost total control, and is falling off the deep end. Fans are outraged at the way Franco is behaving and think his actions are despicable, but what if Franco isn’t really Franco any more, what if he were Todd Manning?\n\nWe were all lead to believe that when Franco went in for brain surgery, it was the tumor that was causing him to be so erratic and evil, what if the Franco we got back in Port Charles never returned, and Todd kidnapped him just so he could take over his life.\n\nIt would make sense that Todd wanted to be in Port Charles, especially since his daughter Starr was living there at the time, and she had no family since both Cole Thornhart and their daughter, Hope, died in a fiery car crash. Todd may be a bit of an insane sadist but his love for his family was genuine and he is fiercely protective of the ones he loves, as you can see by what is happening to Tom Baker (Don Harvey) right now.\n\nRELATED: GH Spoilers For The Week of December 19\n\nNone of this ploy would have worked, if Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner) has questioned Heather Webber’s (Robin Mattson) claims that Franco was his son. Heather produced paperwork says that Franco was Scott’s son, and instead of demanding a DNA test from the certified insane murderer, Scott just accepted her word at face value and took Franco in as his son.\n\nWe all know this story is not going to end well for Franco. There is no way to redeem his character, after everyone finds out about Tom being held captive and tortured. He will not be able to use the brain tumor as an excuse for his actions any longer, so how can they finish this story line? Todd will be the one who has held Franco captive these past couple years and it is Todd, not Franco who is doing these insane things to Tom.\n\nGeneral Hospital fans need to understand Todd’s past, to understand what he is doing now. Franco isn’t the only one who comes from a psychotic family; Todd’s family suffers from severe mental illness as well, especially DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and right now, the man who everyone knows as Franco is showing signs of it as well, although he hasn’t come up with new names for his different identities and personas just yet."
