        "text": "Victoria\n\nLord\n\nCarpenter Real Viki: One of my all time favorite fictional characters is Viki. She was always a woman I looked up to. Though troubled, she was strong, intelligent, and able to hold her own in a profession dominated by men. She was true to herself and fiercely loyal to her friends and family. Viki was not without her demons having suffered a mental illness, DID, due to childhood sexual abuse.\n\nNu Viki: The woman looks like Viki and has Vikis voice, but, is not the character I grew up with. She is now a silly and careless schoolgirl. TPTB have completely discounted this woman's history for the sake of an insta-romance. We are expected to believe that, without any therapy, without even the merest mention of her past demons, is Viki able to suddenly have a normal relationship with Ben, a total stranger she picked up in a bar. I have no problems with a relationship between a younger man and an older woman. My problem is, this older woman, Blondie is no longer Viki. Just one more reason why I am boycotting, I want my real Viki back! Rosie\n\nDorian\n\nLord\n\nHayes Real Dorian: Dorian has always been a model for fierce pride, determination, family loyalty and independence. In a male dominated world, Dorian represents the female spirits inherent ability to overcome and conquer in the face of adversity. The corner stone of the Cramer family, and the relentless adversary for Viki Carpenter, Dorian Lord is the matriarch of her close knit family. Her girls, Cassie, Blair and Kelly rely on her for strength and to be the arms that always catch them when they fall. Real Dorian is an inspiration to all women who aspire to greatness and subscribe unflinchingly to be true to themselves above all things.\n\nNu Dorian: The loss of her husband Mel, her daughter Cassie and the institution of Lindsey as the new adversary for everything that is Buchanan sounded the final warning bell for all Dorian fans. Her place in Llanview as prime antagonist has been ripped out from under her making her one of OLTLs most aimless characters. From consulting a psychic, to being demoted to Blair/Kelly referee, to her constant ON and THEN OFF feud with Viki, Dorians endless search for a new place in the Llanview (after Lindsey robbed of her RIGHTFUL one) has rendered her an almost schizophrenic character; whose motives are often inaudible if not nonexistent. A once tightly defined and passionate character is now just a shallow puddle of her once great self. Melanie\n\nJessica\n\nBuchanan Real Jessica: Bright. Intelligent. Jessica had her own mind and knew better than to get caught up in one-night stands that she would later regret. And why shouldnt she? Jessica had certainly felt the pressure to have sex with her boyfriend, Christian. It was something she discussed with him and her mother on several occasions. And ultimately, she came to the decision that she wasnt ready for sex. When Jessica and Christan briefly broke up, did Jess go out and get hammered? No. She pulled herself together and went out with another guy, and made Chris realize what he was missing.\n\nNu Jessica: Not bright. The antithesis of intelligent. When she spies Chris getting cozy with his old flame, she gets wasted and ends up sleeping with her own stepbrother! Huh? What happened to that smart, clear thinking girl we once knew? She was sacrificed for an instant story about teen pregnancy. Years of tastefully handled scenes about sexual issues, and countless mother-daughter talks between Viki and Jessica were rendered worthless, all for a glossy overview of teen pregnancy issues that have received more depth in an Afterschool Special. Once the most level-headed of the Buchanan clan, and a shining example for young women everywhere, NuJessica was relegated to being just another teen statistic. Snark\n\nBo\n\nBuchanan Real Bo: Bo Buchanan established himself long ago as the white knight of the Buchanan clan. His heart has always been as big as Texas itself, which is why he has always been one of my favorites. Honesty, integrity, justice, loyalty...these are only a few things that have been a core part of Bo Buchanan since his first appearance in Llanview. Bo was always the consummate hero-ever ready to save his damsel in distress, or a friend in need. Whether it is with his family, wives, friends or enemies, Bo could always be counted on to tell it like it is, and pull no punches. Bo was someone you could always trust to be there for you. Thats something I have always admired about him.\n\nNu Bo: Now, it seems that Bo is gone. The white knight has darkened his armor to become just another typical soap opera male. From the moment he decided to hide Georgies attempted seduction from Nora, Bo has never been the same. His sense of honesty was gone. He withdrew from his wife, his family and his friends after his sons death, and suddenly decided that he had nothing worth living for unless he fathered another child. His once keen instinct for the truth was suddenly clouded as he was duped by the people that he knew best. His sense of right and wrong mired in a pit of revenge and gratification. My man in the white hat, my hero, is gone. And whats a girl to do without a hero?Starrstruck\n\nNora\n\nGannon\n\nBuchanan Real Nora: What do you get when you combine intellect, sharp wit, a superb sense of humor, a strong spirit, and a love for the golden age of RocknRoll? You get a character named Nora Gannon Buchanan. Nora came onto the scene in 1992  a true original. Whether she was destroying the opposition in court or cutting loose on the dance floor with the love of her life, Bo Buchanan, she was always fun to watch. She could hold her own with anyone and never allowed her weaknesses to get the better of her. She had strong opinions and, whether I agreed with her or not, I could always admire her conviction and moxie. Nora Buchanan could be called many things stubborn, fiercely independent, a tad neurotic, but she could never be called dumb.\n\nNu Nora: Unfortunately, dumb just about describes Nu Nora to a tee. Shes made bad decision after bad decision in the last year. Gone is the intelligent, strong woman that once graced our screen. Strong-spirited? Nope. She cries and collapses into a quivering heap when confronted with adversity. Intelligent? Nope. Her actions no longer make any sense. Independent? Not anymore. She no longer makes a choice or move without the new man in her life by her side. This character, which used to be able to evoke a large array of emotions from me, now usually evokes only disgust and sadness disgust over what she has become and sadness over how far she has fallen. Jilly\n\nBlair\n\nCramer Real Blair: Blair Daimler blew into Llanview with a fire in her belly and more than a few brains in her head. Within months, shed taken Renee Divines husband and her Auntie Dorians newspaper. Motherhood, and the love and loss of Todd Manning, softened Blairs heart but not her head. The Widow Manning managed to take care of her child, her business, and her dead husbands newspaper, all without either compromising or overly exploiting her sexuality.\n\nNu Blair: By late 1998, Blair wasnt capable of stringing three words together, unless there was a racial epithet involved or the three words at issue were, Help me, [insert soap studs name]. Shed become an indifferent mother, an incompetent business woman, a mindless sex machine, and, perhaps worst of all, a basket case inept at the art of revenge. Leslie Camp aka Holly Body\n\nMax\n\nHolden\n\nReal Max: Over the years, Max Holden has lived many lives and he has seen his way through serious heartbreak. Weve watched him fall in love, struggle to overcome a gambling addiction so powerful it nearly destroyed him, teter on the brink of happily ever after and then lose himself as his wife died in his arms. Weve watched him rebuild his life only to face the powerful realization that his son was deaf, fight the odds and come up a winner. But even when he won, he still seemed lacking in whatever it is that would have made him whole once and for all: an answer to that searching spirit. At his best, he is lady-killer extraordinaire. He can con with the best of them, but beneath a good line, and the sly twinkle of a man on a mission in his eye, is a heart just looking for a place to call his own, at least for a while... Whether his lady love was Gabrielle, Blair, Tina, Megan, Luna, or Maggie; I cursed him when he did wrong but forgave him in the end. Intensity, sensitivity, dangerous charm, sincerity, drive and persistence have always been the foundation of the Real Max.\n\nNu Max: Nu Max has no fire, no spirit, restless or otherwise. He is down and out but with no real hope, strength of character, or leg to stand on storyline wise, to pull himself up. Hes lost his edge, his spark, his intensity, his passion, his love for his children...his drive is gone. He is reduced to a puppy following Blair around-another relationship that has no basis in anything except keeping two brilliant actors tied up in useless, directionless, story. Its a crying shame. Max Holden, one of Llanviews darker golden boys, is given no room to shine under this regime whos lack of regard for the history of the character, and the integrity of the actor and his fans, is nothing short of an insult. M&M Gal\n\nTéa\n\nDelgado Real Téa: Smart, fiesty, independent. Thats my Téa. Insecure about her place in this world, but always fighting to get what she wanted. A tough as nails attorney who proudly said the phrase, I take care of the law, you take care of your conscience. A woman who was able to go head to head with Todd Manning and hold her ground. Through the love between Téa and Todd, we saw a soft side to Téa, but her edge was still there. I saw a woman who wanted it all, love, a family, and a career. And would do anything to make that happen. She could match wits and stand up to anyone in Llanview. And she was fiercely loyal to those close to her. The REAL Téa Delgado I think can be summed up best in the words of her husband, Tough as nails, soft and beautiful.\n\nNu Téa: Suddenly, Téa is whiny and dependent. She cant make a decision on her own anymore. The tough defense attorney is now a morally responsible ADA. What!?! Instead of thinking for herself, she lets others think for her and goes along blindly with what they say. Shes become a woman that needs to be led around by a man, and seems completely helpless. This is not my Téa Delgado. I dont know who this is. I want the REAL Téa Delgado back. Kelly\n\nHank\n\nGannon Real Hank: Hank Gannon (aka Hank the Cannon Gannon), is a man of integrity and strength; truly someone who a person can depend on for some sound, rational advice. Bullheaded and opinionated to a high degree, he still managed to have a great sense of humor and even a touch of vulnerability when it came to the people closest to him. Hank was a true warrior of the nineties, fighting against injustice and prejudice - both in and out of the courtroom.\n\nNu Hank: NuHank shows up barely once a week for a short token appearance. Not only does he seem to have forgotten the vast majority of his friendships and close ties, but is also conspicuously absent in the courtroom. Gone is the multi-layered character that was once such an integral part of the Llanview canvas. In his place is a flat, one-dimensional, wooden character. Anna\n\nRJ\n\nGannon\n\nReal RJ: The real Randall James RJ was a smart, cool, calculating, no holds barred loan shark; who, on his way to Llanview, made life miserable for Max Holden and Blair Daimler. AKA Jimmy Glover turned out to be the ex-con little brother of Henry Gannon, Llanviews straight-laced D.A. RJ was a multi-dimensional bad guy who had more than just revenge against his big brother on his mind. RJ was bad to the bone and he was going to make Llanviews citizens stand up and take notice. They did and so did we.\n\nNuRJ: NuRJ had first been turned into a stupid RJ way back in September when they had him pick up the gun that shot Drew. Recently he has been turned into a jealous, pathetic drunk, to make a non-contract character, John Sykes, look good to Téa Delgado. There is no way that REAL RJ would be that stupid during the Drew Murder or become a drunk over Téa. Real RJ is against substance abuse; and since he is suspect in all Llanview crimes, he would have gotten the hell out of there after Drew was shot. REAL RJ was once an equal to Carlo Hesser, Llanviews other number #1 bad guy; now he has gone psycho over Téa? A woman who hardly gave him the time of day? The only good thing going for RJ is his friendship with Dorian; unfortunately that friendship is one-sided and their scenes together always end up being all about Dorian. I would like to see RJ get back to being bad to the bone; get over his Téa obsession; and team up with Dorian. Llanview needs a villain and villainess, not two psychos whose obsessions will eventually end them up in St. Annes or Statesville. (Oh, and get a RJ a woman, NOW!) Cathi"
