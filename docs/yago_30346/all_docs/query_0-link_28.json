        "text": "When “One Life to Live” went off the air just over a year ago it was my favorite daily drama and it had been for quite some time. So, while the show’s ratings were rising, it was quite a shock to learn it had been canceled in 2011. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous with the series coming back, but this time without executive producer Frank Valentini and head writer Ron Carlivati.\n\nI can honestly say after viewing the premiere episode at the big launch event in New York City, most of my worries were gone. It instantly felt like we were back in Llanview. Could it be because it never really felt like “OLTL” was gone since it continued on via “General Hospital” in Port Charles? That may have helped some, but in the end it comes down to the writing.\n\nThom Racina has done a brilliant job bringing the show back to life. The integration from “GH” went seamlessly and “OLTL” feels like it has picked up right where it left off. The carryover from the stories involving the “One Life” characters on “GH” has integrated into the show perfectly and taking off on their own without any hesitation. Not only have these stories picked right up, but the entire show has instantly come together like it hadn’t been gone at all.\n\nOf course, my favorite moment was the instant return of Trevor St. John as Victor Lord, Jr. While we all expected it would eventually happen, it was a pleasant surprise to see it on the first episode. When Victor was “killed” off the ABC version of “OLTL,” I was disappointed we didn’t get more interaction between Victor and Todd. Any scene Roger Howarth is in as Todd Manning is a favorite of mine. So the fact that we can revisit a Todd and Victor story has huge potential and is something I look forward to.\n\nVictoria Lord (Erika Slezak), Clint Buchanan (Jerry verDorn), Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser), David Vickers Buchanan (Tuc Watkins), Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) and Nora Buchanan (Hillary B. Smith) all gave off the impression that we just left them last week. Meanwhile, I honestly had never seen Corbin Bleu (Jeffrey King) acting in anything before, but I do think he fits in well as a reporter at The Banner.\n\nThe new set for Shelter is quite impressive. However, the idea of people of all ages attending the same club at the same time is not. I know as a teen the last place I would go to hang out would be any place my parents would be. But apparently Shelter is not based on any one particular age group as everyone in the town seemed to be spending their evening there. While the launch party made sense to kick off the show, lets just hope everyone was there to support the opening of the new club and its owner, Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva), and nothing more.\n\nSpeaking of Shelter, how brilliant was Kelley Missal as Danielle Manning this week? Loved her interaction with Howarth as her character talked to her father, who she hadn’t seen in quite some time. They instantly had chemistry, but that shouldn’t be surprising as Roger can make just about anyone or anything look good in a scene with him. I look forward to more scenes of the two together.\n\nMy biggest critique of the show this week was the lack of shock in Victor’s return and people not questioning where he had been. I am willing to let it slide for now because I am hoping that its part of the story planned in the coming weeks. Either that or the town has just been desensitized to people coming back from the dead.\n\nI honestly did not think a show that had went off as my favorite could return in the same capacity. But somehow with a whole new set of writers and a new executive producer (Jennifer Pepperman), they managed to pull off what I feared was impossible. Sometimes it feels good to be wrong.\n\nIt’s a day that almost never came, but thanks to the team at Prospect Park, “One Life to Live” is celebrating its 45th anniversary today, July 15. In honor of the sudser’s big milestone, iconic actresses Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord) and Kassie DePaiva (Blair Cramer) spoke with reporters about their favorite memories, proudest moments and surprisingly awkward first days.\n\n“I was in such a daze,” recalls Slezak of her start on the sudser. “I had never been on television before. I had been in repertory theater for four or five years and had done a lot of classics, [and I] had never actually ever seen a daytime serial, because I was always in rehearsal. And my very first day was the day after I auditioned and was hired. So they gave me no time whatsoever. I ran over and got the script, memorized it, showed up the next morning far too early. There was nobody even there… but I do remember that there were three people who totally carried me through the day, and the first one was Sydney Andrews, who was our stage manager, who couldn’t have been more helpful. And then Lynn Benesch, who played my sister, Meredith, and Ernie Graves, who played my father, Victor Lord. Without them, I would never have made it through the day. I was a nervous wreck.”\n\nBut whether or not DePaiva had a more awkward first day is debatable! “I was a recast, so I was trying to keep my southern accent under wraps, and I was working opposite the great Erika Slezak and Roy Thinnes (Alex Crown), and I had to wear a bathing suit!” she says with a laugh. “So I don’t know which was more nerve wracking: having to wear a bathing suit, or… not sound like a country girl and work with Erika Slezak.”\n\nThere have been a lot of storylines over the 42 years since Slezak’s first day and the nearly 20 since DePaiva’s, and each actress can pinpoint their exact favorites. “For me, it was the Max gambling storyline,” DePaiva recalls. “It involved Luna (Susan Batten) and Cord (John Loprieno) and Max (James DePaiva) and Blair, and it was all about addiction. I was addicted to Max, and Max was addicted to gambling, and Luna was caught in the middle, and it had a lot of darkness to it, but it really gave an opportunity to tell really heartfelt soap opera, and… it was just beautifully written and powerfully executed. I really enjoyed being a part of that.”\n\nAdds Slezak: “I think one of my all time favorites was the Paris, Texas story, and also when I went to heaven. That was lovely, comfortable. And bringing back all the old characters. There are innumerable favorite stories, but those are the two that stick out right now.”\n\nOf course, just because those were their favorite stories doesn’t mean those were their proudest moments! “Mine was living through the live week and just getting through it!” says DePaiva with a laugh. “It was the climax of a great story, when Blair [had] to confront Todd about his lying about Jack’s birth and death situation. So that was, to me, one of the most thrilling moments on the show.”\n\nAs for Slezak, she’s most proud of the fact that ‘OLTL’ is headed into its 45th year. “I have so many things that I’m proud of on the show, but I think just the longevity that the show has achieved is I guess what I’m proudest of. That together, we all created something that lasted on television 43, 44 years, and then we moved to the Internet, and now we’re going back on television [on OWN]. And I think I’m enormously proud of that.”\n\nSpeaking of the show debuting on OWN, it’s a perfect way to honor the show’s anniversary. “The launch [on] OWN is kind of a great celebration of our coming back to life,” DePaiva shares, adding that it’s a great way for viewers to take part in the anniversary festivities. “Maybe the fans will tune in to OWN and have a celebration at home while they watch, because we’re actually coming back to television, which is really exciting.”\n\n“[But] we certainly should have a bigger celebration when we all get together back in production,” Slezak adds. “Because we do have a lot to celebrate.”\n\nOn Friday, January 24, NBC’s “Days of our Lives” put rumors to rest when it officially announced that former “One Life to Live” actress Kassie DePaiva (ex-Blair Cramer) would be joining its cast in the contract role of Eve Donovan, a role which was originated by actress Charlotte Ross, who congratulated DePaiva on signing onto “DAYS” on Twitter.\n\nIn a full-length message posted on her official website, DePaiva noted that she’s happy to be joining the soap and taking on the role of Eve Donovan in the process. “I’m equally as happy to say hello to Eve Donovan. She seems to have a very rich history in Salem with many family members to surround her. I look forward to discovering the character as well as the town. I wish the gloriously beautiful and talented Charlotte Ross great success as she starts her new adventure on ABC’s ‘Nashville.’ I know she is greatly loved by the ‘DAYS’ audience and I have very big shoes to fill. I promise to do my best to live up to everyone’s expectations,” said the actress.\n\nYou can read DePaiva’s message in its entirety below:\n\nWell, I’m sure you have heard the news by now… I am headed to NBC… The wonderful “Days of Our Lives” soap opera!!! This year Days will be celebrating its 50th year on network television and I am thrilled to be a part of it. And now that it is official I can shout it from the mountain tops! I got the call ironically in December on the 20th anniversary of my debut as Blair Cramer on ABC’s “One Life to Live”.\n\nAnd as sad as it is to say goodbye or put Blair on hold… I’m equally as happy to say hello to Eve Donovan. She seems to have a very rich history in Salem with many family members to surround her. I look forward to discovering the character as well as the town. I wish the gloriously beautiful and talented Charlotte Ross great success as she starts her new adventure on ABC’s “Nashville”. I know she is greatly loved by the Days audience and I have very big shoes to fill. I promise to do my best to live up to everyone’s expectations. So all you “One Life to Live” watchers…it’s time to start watching “Days of Our Lives” now. You will be caught up and ready to really invest in Salem by the time I start airing this summer.\n\nNeedless to say… I am a huge soap fan. I love the genre and couldn’t be happier to be back in the mix. Thank you all for all your lovely comments and tweets. I look forward to the coming year with great anticipation. I start working on set very soon and will keep you posted!!!\n\nUPDATE 5:25 PM, ET: An ABC representative has confirmed to Soap Opera Network that Kristen Alderson will be departing “General Hospital” in the near future. No further details were released.\n\nPREVIOUS 5:15 PM, ET: After joining the cast of ABC’s “General Hospital” in the contract role of Starr Manning in 2012, which she originated in 1998 on “One Life to Live” when she was just 6 years old, Daytime Emmy Award winner Kristen Alderson (Kiki Jerome) has decided to leave the daytime drama series.\n\nWord of Aldersdon’s exit from “GH” came to light via a report by Soap Opera Digest, citing setside sources. Alderson’s real-life love, Chad Duell (Michael Corinthos), later confirmed the news on Twitter, where he stated, “[it] was her decision btw” in response to Digest‘s initial reporting.\n\nIn January 2012, it was announced that Alderson, along with on screen parents Roger Howarth (Franco; ex-Todd Manning) and Kassie DePaiva (Eve Donovan, “Days of our Lives”; ex-Blair Cramer), would be uprooting her character from Llanview, following the cancellation of “OLTL” by ABC, to Port Charles. Alderson debuted the following month.\n\nIn 2013, a lawsuit was filed against ABC surrounding the network’s use of “OLTL” characters on “GH” after the network had previously licensed them to Prospect Park, who at the time was gearing up for the online reboot of “OLTL” and “All My Children.” ABC later opted to bring the actors back to “GH,” but as new characters.\n\nLearning of Alderson’s upcoming exit from “GH,” DePaiva tweeted, “Oh no!!!
