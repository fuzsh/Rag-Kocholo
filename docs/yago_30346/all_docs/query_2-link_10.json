        "text": "I’m not sure that Tommy’s birth name is Todd Manning Jr. I think that’s just what Spencer called him. If it were is birth name - I don’t think it would have taken this long for Todd to find him. (I could be wrong)\n\nWill they ever tell him about his mother? This is a soap! It will come out in about 10 years when he is in high school and people tease him, just like they did with Star this year. Margaret also had a sister, I’m guessing that she’ll make an appearance and demand sometype of visitation rights. I’m sure that Margaret also has parents that will want visitation (hmmm…maybe a casting call will be announced shortly)\n\nWill Todd let Michael and Marcy be part of Tommy’s life? We’re talking about Todd here. I wouldn’t hold my breath on that one.\n\nSpencer never would have adopted him out as Todd Manning Jr. That was the name Margaret gave him but it wasn’t placed on a birth certificate because there wasn’t one. As Todd stated, he doesn’t know a child named Tommy so I doubt that the kid would keep that name.\n\nIf I were Todd, it would be a cold day in an ice covered Hades before I let either Marcie or Michael near my child!"
