        "text": "TSJ’s last day filming for the show was late July (the 22nd). The entire time I’ve been hoping that TPTB released the information to throw fans off track (much like the ‘Todd’s execution scenes when, I believe, TSJ’s contract was up and TPTB kept us guessing about whether or not he would return. At time moves on, I realize that it’s utterly hopeless to believe that TPTB are playing a waiting game and I realize that RH’s Todd has indeed won out. While I’d preferred having both men onscreen, it’s clear that RH’s Todd had to win out. Bummer, but I accept it will adjust.\n\nBummer? Yes, bummer. I’ve been adamant that I want TSJ to be declared the ‘real Todd’ while keeping RH’s Todd on as the newly discovered brother brainwashed into believing he was Todd Why? Although it took me a while to warm up to him, I’ve been a huge TSJ supporter since Todd’s “death row” storyline. It’s one of the most ethereal, hauntingly beautiful, storylines OLTL writers have offered. A rapist, who later became a rape survivor, is on death row after being convicted of killing his assailant. I think TSJ added an intangible quality to the role that RH’s Todd didn’t have.\n\nRather than build on the magnificence of that storyline and send Todd on a journey of introspection, OLTL writers took the opportunity to make Todd meaner, angrier, and more vile with each act -primarily to prop other characters and storylines. TSJ’s Todd was sacrificed to sell Cole and the Starr as a burgeoning supercouple and the writers wasted no time in taking TSJ’s Todd to a new low (battering Cole, knocking a pregnant Starr down a flight of stiars, threatening to kill orphaned adolescents, bullying Starr’s friends, etc).\n\nTodd had become such a heinous character that OLTL writers wasted months creating a new ‘high school musical’ around the “eternal” love of Starr and Cole, with Todd being cast as evil personified. Much of Langston’s play centered around the heartlessness of a man like Todd, who’d lost the ability to recognize and bask in the glow of true love. When an entire town’s collective life revolves around a high schol musical on the glory of teen love/pregnancy as a lesson about love for the ages? Your show and its characters are doomed. I think the show for far too long leveraged its credibility on the backs of its youngest performers (not their fault at all) in the hopes of bringing in newer/younger viewers — and as has always been true of daytime, younger viewers are as uninterested in hot mess storyline about their lives as the rest of us. It didn’t stop TSJ’s Todd from becoming a causalty and beginning the downward spiral toward irrelevance.\n\nLike RH before him, TSJ’s portrayal of the character became one of boredom and he began projecting ‘shorthand’ acting. His responses became quick quips. Facials expressions (plural) became facial expression (singular). The return of Marty Saybrooke was the death of TSJ’s Todd Manning. His struggle for redemption – post Marty’s rape (the first time) was gone. His sad realization that he would never be able to make up to Marty, or the community he offended and terrorized, for his actions was gone. His struggle to forgive himself for what he’d become, was gone.\n\nThe writers, I can only guess, felt that they’d found the one sure fire way of giving all of that back to fans. RH’s Todd gets a fresh start. If he becomes ‘Real Todd’, it means that the writers can take us back to the place where we loved the flawed Todd Manning because he would still be struggling with his humanity and his fighting his fear of returing to the sociopath he’d once been (the sociopath TSJ’s Todd was sacrificed to become once again).\n\nWatching Viki with Todd, even I began to long for old Todd. I remembered how instrumental a role Viki played in Todd’s redepmtion and how much closer to human she made him. The few minutes of Viki with the RHTodd’s (the Todd who was allowed to experience human emotions) made me “homesick” and sad that the writers had wasted the gifts that TST brought to the role at the same time. There is something special in RH’s Todd’s relationship with Viki that TSJ’s Todd was never allowed to capture. I felt like an intruder watching Viki watch her baby brother (RH Todd) sleep. The moment felt so real and I could only imagine that in fictional Viki’s shoes that I, too, would long for the brother with a familiar face, a familiar sound and familiar mannerisms.\n\nI get it, because as much as I’ve loved TSJ in the role and for as much as I hope there is a way to bring him back, afterall, I can see the emtional threads of this storyline braiding themselves together to give fans the Todd they’d hoped they would get with TSJ and were disappointed when the writers had other plans. EZ’s Viki and RH’s Todd have the opportunity to bring viewers back to what feels like ‘home’.\n\nInitially, this storyline led me to imagine the Emmy worthy work Erika Slezak would deliver as the emotional heart of the Lord family, torn between two brothers who want to be loved best by her – one who now had everything and one who’d pretty much lost it all. Both brothers would be fearful of being rejected in favor of the other. I thought of the stress and pain it would cause Viki to constantly be asked to choose between them, as it has caused her the same gutwrenching pain she experiences even still with her daughters. Ithought of the comic moments with the two sets of long lost Lord twins, RH-Todd and his favorite, Jess. TSJ -Todd becoming Natalies’s champion. In the end, while both Todds are familiar to Viki, both would be strangers. Now it’s becoming clearer that the writers are going to make a ‘choice’ themselves, and I’m resigned to the fact that their choice won’t be mine and TSJ won’t be back. More is the pity.\n\nUltimately, it must be hell to work for an ABC soap in a familiar role. From the return of the “Real Greenlee” to the return of RH’s Todd, any actor would probably be smart to consider themselves just a temporary long-term replacement in any ABC soap role.\n\nOh, OLTL writers. Why wait until AFTER the show is cancelled to write a compelling set of plots!?!?! We have two key pieces of information that help put the T/T2 storyline in broader perspective, I think. The first is the unaired woman’s face, head of a secret organization which held Todd (or Todd2) prisoner. The second is Viki looking over the picture of Todd/Todd2’s mother, Irene — nice touch!\n\nSpeculation time: Irene and the heartless head of the spy organization one in the same person.\n\nWas Irene a plant, sent in from this secret spy organization to get close to Victor Lord? Was she a dangerous spy of some sort who was supposed to uncover Victor’s coldwar dirt (to whom was he selling secrets/weapons/etc) and then meant to kill him? Did the organization fake her death when her mission was over and allowed her to recover one of her sons only to send him off somewhere safe when she realized that a child was in the way of her ambition to rise to power in the agency? Did she plan to bring the unknown twin in to replace the known twin (Todd), who is obviously a bitter failure in her book since he couldn’t be controlled?\n\nOf course, a complete and utter indifference would explain why she didn’t care that her brother subjected one of her sons to incredible torture during his childhood and why she never intervened to help Todd as he careened out of control in his young adulthood. In hindsight, it benefitted her. She later realized that she needed a sociopathic cold-blooded killer she could trust or at least control, someone linked to her. It’s exactly what she thought one of her sons became. Thanks to her brother’s cruelty, Todd had learned to not care about others and to inflict pain without remorse. The trouble with him would have been the fact that he doesn’t take orders, and that he felt no allegiance to anyone – not even his believed dead mother. Allowing the other twin to be beaten, tortured and brainwashed in her own agency made Todd1’s failure to become her puppet immaterial. She could create the cold-blooded killer-superagent she needed in Todd2.\n\nOh yes, I’m intrigued, OLTL writers, and enough so that I forgive you for creating yet another set of mystery twins in the Lord family and hope that the execution of the Todd-Todd2 storyline is far more successful than the mind numbing Jessica/Tess/Hot Messica-Natalie storyline. I’m even willing to pretend that the other twin pair doesn’t exist at all! Yeah, Todd and Todd2 are just that interesting. By the way, does this now mean that Todd1 has to split his inheritance with Todd2? Now THAT is going to be the place where these brothers part company!\n\nDestiny – Nora: The mother of all showdowns?\n\nLove or hate her, the one consistency about Nora is that when it comes to the law, she’s willing to do what she can to help those she cares about and believes in escape what she thinks of as an unfair prosecution. When it comes to her children? There is no such thing. Hell hath no fury! The Ford Brother (whichever one it is, they’re all the same to me) only escaped having Nora give him a proctology exam like no other because he had something to trade, his freedom for Matthews’.\n\nAs much as Nora loves Destiny, is there anyone who doesn’t believe that if the writers are consistent, Nora will take young Destiny to court to prevent her from aborting Matthew’s child if she doesn’t decide on her own to keep it? I can’t see Nora talking Destiny into keeping this baby if her own mother wasn’t able to, and I can’t see Nora sitting idly by while Destiny makes this decision. I could see Nora on one side, Bo in the middle and Destiny and her mother fighting for her right to not have to keep a child she’s not ready to raise on her own, or even with the help of the Buchanans.\n\nWhatever the decision, I hope it’s Destiny’s to make and I hope she can handle the consequences. If true the form, the writers will have Matthew wake up and remember Dani alone, and his great love for her. Destiny’s face won’t ring any bells for him. He won’t feel close to her or her child (should she decide to keep it). If Destiny decides not to keep the baby, I can see Matthew waking up, again in love with Dani, and having the poor girl feel twice as lonely and in despair — no child, no Matthew, just heartache. Either way it rolls, insanity is in Destiny’s future — because women in daytime go crazy without the love of the objects of their affection. I think it’s a rule, or just a misogynistic wish on all soap writers’ parts.\n\nThe Good: Thank you writers for finally wrapping up the ‘Baby Chloe- Hope’ storyline. It’s been a long time in coming and I was getting sick of it!\n\nThe Bad: (With sarcasm): Thank you writers for the ‘Baby Chloe -Hope’ storyline.\n\nThe WTF: (with incredulity and a tad bit of disgust): Thank you writers for the ‘Baby Chloe -Hope’ storyline. Of all of the storylines you COULD have told, this is what you saddle us with?\n\nThere are some legitimately wonderful reasons to love OLTL, in my book:\n\n1. It’s not All My Children. Need I say more?\n\n2. None of the characters are named Michael Corinthos Jr. How is it is that General Hospital writers have a knack for taking an event that should be considered a blessing and turn it into such an awful AWFUL thing? Little Michael Corinthos’ awakening was something I felt myself regretting about 10 minutes after the kid opened his eyes. To the credit of OLTL’s writers, they haven’t managed to make me wish that any of their teen characters would lapse into a coma! ALTHOUGH… I wouldn’t mind seeing LESS of all of them.\n\n3. Viki Lord. Period. What would this show do without Erika Slezak? I don’t even want to know!\n\n4. The triangle between Clint/Nora/Bo will be heating up soon into a quadrangle with mixed partners Clint/Nora/Bo/Lindsey. I’ve never been a big Bo/Nora fan – primarily because I’m not a Nora fan. I say that knowing that MANY OLTL fans are Bo/Nora fans and for their sake, I sure hope that the show’s writers honors its history and gives the couple back to the audience who loves them. The question is… what happens to Clint?\n\nClint/Lindsey? (Can you imagine their couples name? Clindsey? Lint? FUN!) Since it seems that CH’s Lindsey’s stay is temporary, I have doubt as to whether the writers would move in that direction. Too bad, Lindsey was fabulous with both Clint and Bo in the past. I would be interested in the chemistry between JVD’s Clint and CH’s Lindsey.\n\nClint, on his own? Angry? Scheming to break up Bo and Nora? Where’s the fun in that? I’d rather see Clint go back to London before having him take on his own brother over a woman he shouldn’t have been with in the first place. I had a preference for Clint and Nora over Bo and Nora, but to have Clint becoming involved with the love of his brother’s life was a bit much for most of you and in moments of objectivity, I agree.\n\nClint and Viki? If you’re going to make me suffer through Bo and Nora, writers, I’ll take Clint and Viki (no worries, anti-Clint/Viki fans… I never get the pairings I like). I think Clint and Viki/ Bo and Nora have the potential to take fans back to some of the glory days of OLTL. I have to admit that I’m concerned about the initial awkwardness of the two couples getting together in light of Nora and Clint’s relationship… eh,there’s been worse on this show.\n\n5. Believe it or not, I think that John and Marty (or the prospect of John and Marty) would be far more interesting than Blair and John – who’ve only managed to put me to sleep.\n\n6. Jessica and Brody. Even now, I’m still disappointed that Nash is gone and that Jared survives in his place, BUT, at least TPTB have come as close as they possibly could to Nash, without trying to replace him with a ‘Nash Clone’. Brody has ‘Nash like’ qualities (hot as sin, a beautiful body, thoughtful, kind, and loving), but have given him a unique personality and core.\n\nSo… setting aside that things I actually like, I have to say that the ‘Baby Chloe- Hope’ storyline has the potential to keep me tuning out OLTL (or at least FFing most of whatever episodes I bother recording.\n\nI think the teen pregnancy storyline was the biggest mistake the writers have made so far. I’m not against the idea of a teen pregnancy storyline. I’m simply against the teen pregnancy storyline for the chosen characters. Why?:\n\nI hate the back door approach to keeping Todd and Marty connected given their history. It’s bad enough that he’s violated her twice in a lifetime, but now they’re connected because their children are ‘in love’ and are now parents together. BULLOX!\n\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. This is NOT a storyline that plays to Kristen Alderson’s strengths. She has become the weak link in this storyline. I find KA’s emotional responses to be stilted and unbelievable.\n\nAdding the teen pregnancy storyline on top of the drug addiction storyline was a bit much. The writers have seemingly decided that the juiciest storylines should go to the youngest actors and that the veterans should be stuck with trivial, pointless, boring storylines. It’s another storyline for which Kristen Alderson seemed completely unprepared and didn’t connect as an actress, in my opinion. She uttered the dialogue well enough, but her performances felt like a ‘script reading’ rather than watching someone who was emotionally impacted by a loved one’s drug abuse.\n\nOddly enough, Brandon Buddy has done as well as any actor with significantly more experience. He’s been a marvel. The only problem with having handed him this storyline is that he seems far too mature an actor for the role he now plays. It’s time to SORAS Cole to 18 and find him a cougar (no older than 25, please, not someone too much older). “Starr and Cole” now feel like little Starr and her much older brother – ICK!!!!!!!!! By the way, Brandon should be nominated, next year, for the addiction storyline.\n\nKA fans I’m not completely ‘Anti-Starr’. I think there are a number of storylines that would be great for the character and would showcase the actress’ abilities well. The Baby Chloe-Hope storyline just isn’t one of them.\n\nMac Scorpio, real man!\n\nThank you GH writers. I’ve been jonesing for Mac Scorpio scenes (at least, Mac scenes that didn’t treat him like a bumbling buffoon unable to control mob life in Port Chuckles). Not only did fans get to see Mac in the best possible light, the writers threw in all sorts of goodies, for veteran viewers:\n\n– Mac and Robin’s connection is undeniably PERFECT. The relationship Robin has with ‘Uncle Mac’ is as special as the one she has with her parents. Mac gets her, he understands her in a way that it’s not clear that either Anna or Robert do – which makes sense as he’s been her surrogate father for so many years. I love that he shows up at the right time and knows what she needs without her having to say much to him. The looks between the two characters carried their own dialogue.\n\n– I’ve been calling for the writers to return the Scorpios to prominence – not that they listen to me, folks, but I try! I’ve wanted Anna and Robert to be there for Robin, as well. Maybe they will never be there for her, given the writers’ current priorities, but I will give them credit for realizing how much Mac matters.\n\nThe look of love and gratitude in Robin’s face said it all, but I loved hearing her tell him what a wonderful man he is. Mac hasn’t raised biological children of his own, but he’s been more of a father than almost any other man on this show. I don’t think there’s any other character on this show who has served as a surrogate father to so many children, and accepted the job without bitterness and with taking the charge so seriously. Mac has never walked away from his girls. Nothing and no one could drive him away. All three (Georgie, Maxie, and Robin) were left to him by parents who eventually deserted them for different reasons at different times. He was there, and that’s all that matters.\n\n– The writers tugged at the heartstrings by bringing up Georgie during those scenes, as well. That Mac mentioned his lost daughter, a child he’d raised from her earliest days in life, was bittersweet. That it was because he got to love her and raise her that he was able to help Robin in her time of need was a lovely thread that pulled this family together. We rarely see Mac so we don’t have to think as much about his grief as we would if he was on screen every day. I like being able to believe that Mac will get to heal by being able to continue to care for his girls, and now gets to add Emma to the list.\n\nWith broken heart he keeps giving back makes him an ideal man. Daytime writers have a tendency to make grief-striken characters withdraw from life, or make sick and ridiculous choices shortly after a death occurs (sleeping with someone they shouldn’t and becoming a parent, for instance). Mac’s grief makes him embrace the children he’s raised even more. He gives back, without question, and without judgment. Why can’t we have more MEN like Mac in daytime?\n\nThe Guiding Light is shining a little brighter!\n\nI can’t help it! I still think GL is one of the most aesthetically displeasing shows in daytime, but it just doesn’t matter as much right now! The writers have done the unthinkable. They’ve surprised me by making the love of Shayne’s life Edmund’s daughter. Where the hell did that come from? The Royal family of San Cristobel is already connected to the Lewis family through Jon Randall, but this? It’s even better. There’s something about Edmund and Shayne’s connection over Lara that makes me hope it’s genuine and not just another ploy by Prince Eddie. The connection humanizes Edmund. He’s always been more than a one dimensional villain and the writing for his return has been perfect, so far. I’ve loved Edmund’s wicked ways in the past – even if I couldn’t bring myself to root for his success. This storyline has me simply loving Edmund!\n\nThe chemistry between Reva and Dinah? Worth it’s weight in gold! I love the potential MIL – DIL fights between them. Dinah, as Reva’s daughter-in-law? KARMA, baby! More likely than not, even if it happens, it’s probably the case that Lara lives – daytime writers NEVER devote that much energy to a dead character we’ve never met, unless they plan to bring them back.\n\nRemy and Christina? Cuter and cuter by the day. They feel like a ‘real’ couple. I love that she tries to get him to see the best in himself, and that he does the same for her. Finally a couple building each other up instead of tearing each other down. I hate being this happy about a couple. It’s always a matter of time before writers ruin good characters and couples in order to ‘add passion and drama’ to their relationship. What happens next? A heartbroken Alan tricks Christina into sleeping with him? She becomes pregnant? Alan then owns her? Remy cheats with Lizzie? Remy and Christina find out they’re related? I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it. For now? I’m full-tilt giddy and will keep enjoying them!\n\nMallet and Marina and the baby-crazies? Not feeling it. My only fear is that Dinah is pregnant with Grady’s child and M&M end up raising it through private adoption because they can’t adopt otherwise. When Grady goes, let’s make sure ALL of Grady goes. Leave no spawn behind. (Ok, one more criticism about their storyline: How silly is it that Mallet would dispose of his ‘hit man gear’ in a Springfield-Peapack pond? It’s not like the briefcase will be swept down stream and out to the ocean! It’s a freakin’ pond in PEAPACK (Springfield)\n\nThe voice of an angel and pretty as a picture!\n\nSo imagine my surprise when Maggie Horton (played by the incomparable Suzanne Rogers) ripped dear Chloe a new one! What irony! Sami Brady loved Lucas for all he was worth and mama Kate made it her mission to destroy Sami. She would have rather have dated her son HERSELF before letting Sami near him. For Chloe, Kate opened her home, her family, and her heart and Chloe not only cheated on Lucas (who at this point may as well be renamed ‘Lucas the lovable loser’), but she betrayed Kate in the process. Oh dear!\n\nWhile the writers have done a miserable job of honoring its veteran characters and actors, I think it was masterful for Maggie to be the person who confronts Chloe. Maggie has always been a staunch (non pathological) defender of her family, but she’s not sainted. Newer fans may not have understood the significance of Maggie’s shameful glance downward when Chloe asked her if she’d ever made a mistake, but veteran viewers got it. Two words: Neil Curtis. Maggie not only cheated on her husband, but it was her daugther who caught them in bed together (makes you think of Sami catching Marlena and John, doesn’t it? Marlena. John. Sigh.).\n\nSuzanne Rogers brought the HEAT to confrontation scenes and I enjoyed every minute. More please!\n\nDamn you Tea!\n\nI DO have integrity, you know? I just keep blowing it to hell, cheering you on. Don’t ask me why, but as much as Todd deserves to be punished, I love watching Tea in action. I still can’t figure out why she’s been working so hard to keep Todd out of prison even going as far as claiming to be Lee Halpern/Janet Ketring’s murderer. It’s worth staying tuned in to find out! The minute I saw LH/JK on the floor I thought, ‘Ugh, not again! Will Todd now go on trial for yet another murder he didn’t commit?” It never dawned on me that Tea would take the fall for this. At most I thought she might claim to be with Todd as they walked through the door and found Lee’s body.\n\nSo what happens next? Will Todd lose his hammer once Tea is found out and it turns out that Wes killed LH/JK? Surely she’ll be disbarred, though hopefully not. If Wes is the killer, is this the beginning of a killing spree now that he’s flipped? Is Marty at risk? Maybe as I continue to tune in, I’ll also get to figure out why Antonio brings out a heavy accent in Tea… and only Antonio… What’s that about? I hope it continues for as long as he’s around because I love it (it’s a bit like Bess’ alter producing black glasses).\n\nAdd to the bag of fun OLTL has become: Marty commenting that she always trusts the wrong person, and then not picking up on the fact that she should be more careful about trusting Wes? Fantastic. There are the matching mother-Son addictions. Marty swills alcohol like a warrior (uh, more like Wes) and Cole is popping pills. Marty is too caught up in her own pain to see that something is wrong with her son? Fine, but when this is over, if she goes back to being a therapist, THAT would be a tragedy. It’s hard for me to understand Marty sympathizing with Wes, but leaving Cole in the dark, on his own to deal with her back-from-the-dead act, his child’s death, her rejection, and Todd not being forced to pay for any of his crimes… but she can be there for Wes… got it.\n\nNatalie and Jess raining hellfire on one another? THANK YOU, writers. Lovin’ it. Does Nat seriously want to cause Jess to release Tess again? Eh, it probably won’t happen, but I almost wish it would. I think it’s curious that Nat has become another completely self-absorbed person who can’t put herself in someone else’s shoes. She’s also chosen not to acknowledge her own shady past , a time when she used, lied, and manipulated everyone she could – and she didn’t have an alternate personality to blame her actions on! I love seeing flashes of a fighting Jessica everytime Nat uses Jess’ children as pawns – shame on Natalie. It also sucked that given Jared’s involvement in Nash’s death that Natalie would shove her engagement ring in Jessica’s face. I guess Tess’ attempt to kill them makes Natalie believe they’re ‘even’. Go figure.\n\nYou know the old writers’ insult, “Monkeys banging on typewriters could do a better job!” Imagine if you not only handed a room full of monkeys a set of typewriters (uh, keyboards), but you then locked them in. Well… that’s ONE way to force them to concentrate on completing your scripts, but watch out! Locking them in a room might add insult to injury and monkeys are pretty vengeful. They also have a pretty wicked sense of humor. Make sure you READ the scripts before you film and then air them for long suffering fans.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nBitchy Marty, Bitchy Tea, Bitchy TeBessica… ‘effin.love.them.all.\n\nJessica apologizing and groveling at Natalie’s feet? No thanks. I felt sympathy for Nat “the outsider” for about 10 minutes. I’m over it. She’s still sleeping with the man who cost her sister’s husband his life. An accident? Sure… after months of deceiving him and destroying everything he’d built for his family. I’m hoping Tess and Bess have teamed up to finish taking Nat and Jared down – without plotting anyone’s death, by the way. Abject misery is enough for me, thanks. Tea taking guff from Blair? I don’t think so. Tea and Blair live different realities. Tea is a badass by nature. She’s shown tremendous growth and change and I love how spunky she is. Blair? Badass, on occasion, doormat more often than not. The woman slept with Spencer Truman just after Todd, the ‘great love’ of her life, was sentenced to execution. Despite every reasonable warning to the contrary, she made Truman a part of her children’s lives. My money is on Tea. Marty Saybrooke being left alone with Janet Ketring/Lee Halpern? Seriously, were the monkeys also STONED when they banged out that moment? Writers, keep an eye on the script monkeys, they’re making you look bad!\n\nIt’s annoying enough that Bo and Nora’s situational ethics drag every other living Llanview resident through the muck, but Bo and Tahlia leaving JK/LH alone with an angry and self-destructive Marty? The woman tried to force Todd to commit suicide for what he did to her (with JK/LH’s help). So they let her confront JK/LH, alone, wearing a coat which could very well have contained a weapon, and carrying an uzi sized purse? They actually LEFT the motel? I have to say, violence isn’t my thing, but I got a chuckle out of JK/LH cracking a vase over Talia’s head and taking off. Too bad Bo didn’t get one of those, as well! You’d think JK/LH was a witness for the defense for as careless as they’ve been about her safety. It must be nice to be pals with people like Bo and Nora. They use their offices to go after people you don’t like if you’re a friend, no matter how flimsy the evidence, nor the cost to the good folks of Llanview.\n\nOh, and locked-away-typewriter-banging monkeys? Less smug from Antonio and Nora, please. They’re on the side of RIGHT, and they leave me wanting to see Tea wipe the smug off of their faces – unless that’s what you wanted and then I feel played (well done). If I’m wrongfully faulting you and it’s the choices made by the actors, please speak to the director and ask him to handle it.\n\nThe Bold and The Beautiful\n\nBridget is a designer now? You magnificent vengeful monkeys, you! You really did get the last laugh, didn’t you? I wish I could laugh with you, but I can’t. It hurts. Did you have to pay the writers back at the viewers’ expense? An accelerated undergrad preMed program, supposed ‘years’ of study in medical school. Internships, Residency, saving lives, bringing babies into the world, bringing her aunt Katie back from the dead, saving her brother from jail following Phoebe’s death… and Bridget wants to give it all up to start designing for the company that just ripped off her father’s and brother’s newest collection. Bridget… giving up medicine for THAT!\n\nShe’s doodled haute couture gowns for years and was just too afraid to tell anyone? Her work is even better than life-long designer Clarke Garrison… stuff she sketched when not practicing medicine 23/6 and no one knew? Uh, because despite the fact that EVERY one of her adult sibs, her nieces and nephew, and BOTH of her parents work in the fashion industry, she was too afraid to tell them she has a passion for fashion? Ok, works in your universe, but typewriter-banging-monkeys, if the writers don’t feed you, refuse to type out scripts on an empty stomach. It makes you a little loopy.\n\nThis wouldn’t hurt so bad if it weren’t a follow up to the “fabulous Paminis”… Pam Douglas, insta-designer with a CROCHET technique so secret that only Pam can churn out the one of a kind hot yarn bikinis… So what is Bridget’s Auntie Pam kicking out? 20 a day in the Forrester sweatshop? Monkeys, explain yourselves! Is there something in the air at FC that makes anyone who passes through the hallowed halls a genius in the design world (all except Clarke it seems)?\n\nGuiding Light\n\nAlan wanting revenge against a cheating Beth? I get that. For once in his life, Alan is as devoted as he’s ever has been to a woman, maybe the most faithful he’s ever been. (Beth hasn’t been faithful to anyone since she was a teen) She gives birth to his child, while still raising his grandchildren and making him part of their lives. Then she cheats on him. He now knows that he’s met his match in Beth. No one loves Alan as much as he loves himself. Ditto on Beth. He’s sleeping with his mirror image and it’s driving him mad, life is a cruel mistress, Alan.\n\nI WANT Alan to make Beth miserable, and not for his sake, but because Beth is supremely selfish and sucks as a person. BUT…Alan grabbing the letter opener, TWICE (something TPTB aired when the scenes picked up with a third and fourth time during the next day’s episode, too)? Good mercy. Giving the audience the impression that he would just as soon plunge the opener into her heart because his heart was broken? YIKES!\n\nI don’t remember Alan being violent with women, especially not to the point of contemplating a brutal death for one. He likes owning and controlling women, but he likes owning and controlling everyone. He usually shows more finesse. The old Alan would have had Coop arrested on some trumped up charge, claimed ‘Company’ for himself – leaving Buzz penniless, and set Beth up to think she was going crazy again just to get custody of Peyton. He would have done it all before lunch! He actually would have kept Buzz on at the restaurant he stole from him and had Buzz SERVE him lunch. Alan is psychotic, but he’s no thug.\n\nMonkeys, you owe the GL writers an apology for what you’ve done to their beloved Alan Spaulding. Shame on you.\n\nAll My Children\n\nZach. Killing Josh. Fathering Gabrielle. Eye-boinking with Reese. Expecting Kendall to understand. Vicious little typewriter-banging-monkeys… You’ve outdone yourselves. I actually like the potential fallout from this one. No criticism, here. This is all soapy goodness. AMC was lucky to have you on staff when you wrote that part of the plot. Kendall, forgive Binks, Reese, and Zach. PRICELESS!\n\nWhile you’re at it, write that script where David Hayward is loving and unselfish, Adam Chandler has sworn off manipulating the people he loves, Erica Kane gives up designer clothes and all other perks of fine living, and JR Chandler stays sober! See how silly it all seems that anyone would expect forgiveness from Kendall? Whatever she does to them, they’ve got it coming. Maybe Zach should keep a picture of his happy parts in a safe location. The doctors will need it when they’re working on the reattachment and reconstruction!\n\nI can’t give you a pass on Amanda’s pregnancy, however. Does anyone remember the last daytime pregnancy where the mother knew who her child’s father was (Binks excluded, of course) and there was no scandal around the pregnancy? (Whoops, Binks back in!) Why another contested paternity? It’s not like there’s been a shortage of them.\n\nThen again, you’ve been writing for Annie and she’s freakin’ wonderful, so it all evens out in the wash!\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nClearly there are new writers on board. There HAVE to be! How else can you explain the highly emotional grief scenes following Phoebe’s death!?!? It’ s been a long time since I’ve cried over BnB scenes because they were so highly emotional. Usually if I’m crying over a BnB scene, it’s because of the self-pity I feel knowing I haven’t been able to break my BnB viewing habit.\n\nJacqueline MacInnes Wood was pitch perfect and completely sold me as the soul shattered twin sister unable to fathom living the rest of her life without her other half. Together with Ronn Moss ‘Steffy’ and ‘Ridge’ broke my heart opening the bag containing Phoebe’s personal effects and gingerly removing each time… a shoe, a bag, a hair clip, on their own -each with seeming no real value, now invaluable because of the fact that Phoebe wore them in her last moments.\n\nI shuddered when I saw the door to the hospital morgue. I waited for the gratuitous and exploitive “bloodied and battered” Phoebe images. I was wrong. The writers handled those scenes with a sensitivity rarely seen on this show. They’ve done us proud. For the record, if there is a new team at bat, HIRE THEM… they’re good. If it really is the same writing team, what the hell? Why aren’t we getting this level of writing more often? I don’t even need it daily, just more frequently than we’ve been treated to the past… say… 6 or 7 years!\n\nYoung and the Restless\n\nI’m sorry. I think I’m losing my hearing. I thought I heard Lauren express shock at Gloria’s self-centered behavior and her willingness to allow an innocent party to be blamed for something they hadn’t done. I was shocked that SHE was shocked. Two words: Ashley Abbott… Two more: Face Cream.\n\nAre the writers confused? Is there another character named Gloria living in fictional Genoa City? There has to be, because otherwise the writers could never have written those lines. Instead, they would have had Lauren tell Gloria that it’s time she STOPPED allowing others to pay for her lies and her selfishness.\n\nApparently Kay Chancellor isn’t the only GC resident with a look-a-like, and not the only one suffering from memory loss.\n\nBTW, Phyllis, seriously? It’s not like this is the FIRST marriage you’ve broken up, what’s up with that plan to split Jack and Sharon? What would make her think that Sharon would immediately run to Brad? If Sharon is getting close with Nick, again, and she becomes a free woman, wouldn’t it make sense that she’d have to keep an eye on her wandering, philandering husband? Great going there, big red. Phyllis is just a little rusty at manipulating others.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nOh sure… kill off Nash, bring back Tess, add new alter for Jessica, and then hook her up with the ‘new Nash’. In this case, I think the writers think WE’RE new. Can Jessica please have a love life that doesn’t revolve around alternate personalities and psychiatric care? Please? I’ll admit, I love Jess/Tess/Bess and Brody, I just wish the writers hadn’t used the same plot line they used to pull Tessica and Nash together.\n\nI can only assume that it’s tacit admission that getting rid of Jess and Nash was a FOOLISH move, especially for a storyline that had enormous potential ending with a whimper and not a bang. The revenge storyline became diluted and distracting when it got in the way of other, less compelling, storylines. Natalie and Jared replacing Jessica and Nash as the show’s hot young couple felt like a pipe dream from the beginning.Nared-Jatalie (whatever couple name they’ve earned) are a chemistry challenged couple that makes ‘romance’ feel like a four letter word -and not fun dirty four letter words, either.\n\nI don’t understand the writers’ fascination with Natalie and Jared as a couple and I also don’t understand the sudden forgiveness for their actions. It was Jessica who was angry, and felt betrayed. Jessica watched her husband die. Jessica held him in his last moments. Jessica had to tell him about a child he’d never get to hold. I don’t want Jessica to hate her sister the rest of her life, but the idea that she’s now beyond what’s happened, and that it’s ok that Natalie and Jared are caring for her children just seems odd. At the very least, what should make Jessica’s recovery so difficult is being conflicted, both feeling guilty that Tess took things so far -but still feeling betrayed and feeling angry about their role in Nash’s death, and their role in her family’s financial difficulties in losing BE. To have Natalie and Jared back in good stead just feels hollow and rings false.\n\nThank goodness I have Gigi/Rex/Shane to take my mind off of the rest of it. I love that Shane still loves his hero father, Brody, while being willing to slowly get to know his biological father, Rex. I think it’s realistic for Shane to be confused and still love the man he’s thought of as his father his entire life. I love that he’s a sensitive and loving child. I love that Rex is patient, and respects Shane’s feelings. I’m actually looking forward to more of this little family.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nOh, I should have known. Nicole Walker Dimera (emphasis on Dimera)! What have you done? WHY, writers, WHY? She loves Brady so much, to think that she would try to send him back to his addiction to protect her pregnancy lie? That’s far too vicious, even for Nicole. How could I have fooled myself into thinking the writers would make the character capable of anything else? Oh well… I’m in for the long and the short of it. Nicole will have to face whatever she has coming. It will be well deserved. If she succeeds in the long run, move me to the ‘love to hate’ column for a while. Eventually I’ll find a way to forgive N.W.D. for her dastardly actions… I’m so weak. The writers always get me when it comes to this character.\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nOh dear. I’ll bet you thought that Carly would be vindicated! I’ll bet you thought that the magnificent Snarly had Janet and her demon seed dead to rights, right? HA! What are you, NEW? This is As The World Turns. Everyone turns on Carly, including her own children.\n\nParker forged Carly’s signature, Liberty encouraged it, and it was ‘all good’ because their criminal activity was only about making someone else happy, namely Janet. Sure, Janet is more deserving than most people. It’s ok for her to want a 5k wedding gown, marrying a man with three children, making a cop’s salary. Seriously? That she never looked at the price tag is no excuse, in some ways, it’s WORSE that she didn’t look. Did she really believe that an upscale boutique would have cheap gowns?\n\nParker has to humiliate his mother in front of Janet and Liberty. Great. He forged the signature on his trust fund check to make Liberty happy… and that’s Carly’s fault. They were willing to continue lying about it until they were caught… and that’s Carly’s fault, too; she’s just an evil angry jealous bitch out to stop their happiness (uh, huh, despite the fact that she AGREED to let her jackass ex- take out a second mortgage on their house to pay for his wedding to another woman). This is the man who attacks Carly for the kind of mother she is, NEVER thanking her for raising a child HE brought into their marriage (JJ) after initially abandoning her and their other children, for JJ and his mother, batshit crazy Julia2.\n\nI’m ready to give up on As The World Turns. It’s not JUST the Kick the Carly storylines that are doing it for me. The KTC storylines are symptomatic of a larger problem- the overall lack of balance on this show. I think I’ve had my fill. Someone contact me when the ‘Kick the Jackass’ storylines start (Jack-Janet, take your pick!)\n\nJust a word of caution, writers… viewers who are raising, or have raised, children are NOT entertained by a smart-assed obnoxious kid like Parker. It’s tiring of having the show held hostage by the writers’ interpretation of teenaged hormones gone awry. Liberty-Parker sex scenes, groping, lusting, crying, conspiring, and now attacking Carly for having LEGITIMATE concerns. Get a clue, folks. Surely JJ is missing his brother, by now. It’s time to send Parker and Liberty away to school.\n\nWhere to start, where to start! OH! I know! I have news, folks! You may miss the old boards from the now defunct, but much beloved, Total TV Online! There is still a companion site (message board) for the “Sound and Fury” blog. You can access that site by clicking HERE.\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nCarly is BACK, the Carly that so many fans have grown to love. Carly is a cross between one of daytime’s greatest romantic heroines, and a walking disaster. Today, we got to see a little of both, more of the former than the latter. I believe that Carly has been sincere in her odd couple friendship with Janet. There’s no malice between the two women and Carly wants to see Jack happy with Janet, for his sake, and that of their children.\n\nThe trouble is that despite her best efforts to do the ‘right’ thing, she finds herself in trouble every time. I groaned a bit when she found herself getting hot and heavy with Jack. Other than the family they share together (and yes, I’m including Parker and JJ as ‘theirs’), nothing good has come of Jack and Carly being together. Each of those brief periods of time when they shared love and happiness were quickly replaced with some wild attack on Carly’s character, by Jack. A little crying, a lot of clinging, and too much verbal abuse.\n\nEven still, watching Jack and Carly fall back into bed wasn’t as shocking as I thought it would be. They’re much too addicted to the self-inflicted pain not to keep going back for more. It’s Carly’s guilt that was shocking. That she pushed Jack to be upfront and let Janet know he was in the bedroom before he could stay her was brilliant. That’s the girl, Carly. Don’t let Jack pull his standard hit-and-run routine. I’ll give the guy credit, he did score points by admitting that he’s been a judgmental jerk all these years, but he lost those points FAST by trying to sleep with Carly knowing he still had feelings for Janet.\n\nTo see him working on Carly, playing on the emotion she still had for him, and to then have him run back to Janet? What a putz! Carly is much better off without the guy. Jack thinks of himself, first. He always has. If only the writers would hire an actor to play a credible love interest against MW’s Carly. Brian, perhaps? I’m just not yet ‘digging’ this guy with Lucinda. I think I’d rather seen John Dixon back, and paired with ‘Lucy Walsh’. I miss John and Lucinda and their passion. I have na ulterior motive for suggesting a Carly-Brian pairing.\n\nMaybe Carly can distract Brian so that he STOPS telling Luke to avoid being ‘political’. I find it hard to believe that Luke standing up for himself and supporting the Gay Film Festival would have a negative impact on his foundation. (Uh, when did Oakadle U become ultra conservative?) Brian needs a life… FAST! Rather than telling Brian that she and Luke need him, it’s time for Lucy Walsh, cutthroat businesswoman that she is, to come back. I miss her. It’s time for the REAL Lucy Wlalsh to tell Brian to hit the bricks. 1 – Lucinda has always had such a deep love for her grandson. It’s hard for me to believe that she can’t see what’s going on with Brian, and what the potential impact is on Luke. I just can’t see the writers as being true to her character if they continue to allow her to want Brian, in light of his treatment of Luke and Noah. 2 – Lawrence Lau is HOT, and I’d love to see his character out of such a creepy storyline where he’s trying to suppress Luke’s self-exploration. Luke is finding his voice. Brian is becoming increasingly less attractive trying to suppress it.\n\nAND, since we’ve seen more of Kim this month than in the last several months (or so it seems), please make sure when you bring her back more frequently, writers, that you bring back the brilliant woman we’ve all loved for so long. Kim was the victim of a mad stalker (Oh how I miss the days of the Douglas Cummings storyline). Hopefully she recognizes the signs soon, and works to help Katie with the Spencer incident. Kim’s been there, done that. I’d love to have her realize sooner, rather than later, that Katie has every right to be concerned.\n\nYoung and the Restless\n\nSharon, Sharon, Sharon, my friend. You can’t make a good husband out of a man-whore. Remember those words of advice. I only regret that I forgot to include Nick Newman on my man-whore list, when I included his father. (Read that HERE) Nick hasn’t met a woman, throwing herself at him, that he doesn’t like. Having said that? I can’t help loving Nick and Sharon, despite the fact that he’s an unfaithful pig. Nick and Sharon are their generation’s Nikki and Victor (er, without the pathology that has begun to pervade the Nikktor relationship).\n\nShort of Nick’s cheating with slimey Grace Turner, and Phyllis (serving as Sharon’s ‘placeholder’), there was a genuine love and a sense of family that Nick and Sharon shared that neither has really had with their respective new spouses. For me, Phyllis will always be the woman who went to bed with a man while his wife was still grieving their dead daughter. Nick and Phyllis’ relationship is at romantic as a zombie orgy (sorry, it’s close to Halloween and the commercials for haunted houses are getting to me).\n\nWhat happens in Paris stays in Paris? OH, let’s hope not. Let’s hope that Nick does penance for being a complete idiot and cheating on Sharon, realizes what a horrible mistake he made, and goes home to his real family. He needs to be with his true wife, Sharon.\n\nBesides, the only time Phyllis was remotely interesting was when she was a freakin’ bad girl, and during her marriage to Jack. Outside of that? She hasn’t had much to offer.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nIt’s been so good seeing Viki, so good in fact that I feel guilty having this small complaint: Are fans to believe, that in a house the supposed size of Viki’s mansion, she wouldn’t notice that her basement had suddenly become MUCH smaller? If there was enough space behind the sliding wall to build a ginormous room, complete with on suite bath, you’d think she’d notice SOMETHING was wrong. EH! I don’t care, I’m just glad to have Viki back. Now it’s time to reunite Viki and Clint… We’ve been so patient.\n\nViki must love the relationship between her sister, Tina, and “Jessica”/Tess getting along. Oh, if only she knew! The most enjoyable part of One Life To Live (and dare I say the only watchable part of the show?) has been watching Tina and Jessica go at one another. The only person tough enough, and devious enough, to handle Tess is Tina, and heaven help the show if/when Tina or Tess goes.\n\nWhile Grand Dame Titans Tina and Tess are tearing each other apart, maybe the writers will let Viki serve up a little cold hard justice to brother, Todd. You’d think that Todd would have learned his lesson from letting Blair think their son Jack was dead. Now he’s planning to do the same to Starr, in order to take her child and raise it. I get the saying that history repeats itself… I just don’t know why it’s always the LOUSY history that repeats itself in daytime. Oh Viki, between Todd, Tina, and Tess, you have your work cut out for you.\n\nBold and Beautiful\n\nEr, what? Taylor’s back to her lying, sneaky, and underhanded ways? WELL! No shock THERE folks! I seem to remember THIS Taylor, the one scheming and plotting to get what she wants, and putting a ‘concerned’ face on it. Let’s see, she advised Brooke to stay with Eric, for the children’s sake, even though Brooke was unhappily married to the man. Then she (Taylor) pursued Ridge, the man Brooke loved – knowing Ridge loved Brooke and was waiting for her to leave Eric.\n\nTaylor advised Eric to tell Stephanie their marriage was over and there was NO chance of him returning to her.. after she listened to her ‘best friend’ cry about Eric not loving her… and then Taylor moved on Eric, herself. Now she’s telling Ridge that the fates were probably keeping him and Brooke apart because they probably weren’t meant to be together. Taylor, would those be the same fates that caused Ridge to walk out on YOU and not look back? Funny how those fates only work against others, never against her. Ah, hypocrisy. The REAL Taylor is back… the “me first, me last, me always” Taylor."
