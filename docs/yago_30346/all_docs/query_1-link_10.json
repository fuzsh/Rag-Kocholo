        "text": "Soap fan favorite, Kassie DePaiva is making a return to ABC’s General Hospital in her role as Blair Cramer from One Life to Live.\n\nA rep for the daytime drama series confirmed to TV Line that DePaiva will begin airing in September. DePaiva appeared as Llanview’s Blair before on GH.\n\nAfter One Life to Live ended in 2012, and in March of that year, GH kicked-off a crossover story that featured DePaiva along with Roger Howarth, formerly Todd Manning on One Life and GH.\n\nWhile Howarth has remained at GH in other roles over the years including as Franco Baldwin and Austin Gatlin-Holt, DePaiva has also been playing Days of our Lives’ Eve Donovan on and off. She recently appeared on the Peacock streaming soap opera earlier this month when she reprised Eve for a short stint.\n\nDePaiva recently spoke to Soap Opera Digest saying she would love a chance to back to GH and reprise Blair, but she added, “I guess Todd is not Todd, right?’ So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go,‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.’”\n\nLooking forward to seeing Blair on GH again? What story would you like to see her involved with? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nOn the Tuesday, August 30th episode of ABC’s General Hospital, John “Jagger” Cates (Adam J. Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her. She then adds that at some point she put her hands on Kristina, but Kristina pulled away, and tripped over some luggage and fell through the window. Ava begs Nina to believe her. Later, Nina make a call to someone calling in a favor.\n\nAfter his case against Kristina goes bust, Cates heads to Ava’s gallery, where he informs her what happened in court. Ava thinks she will really need her lawyer now and she hasn’t heard from Scott. That is when Cates pipes up that she doesn’t need Scott and how she is the only hope he has left.\n\nCates tells Ava that she has to give him a statement, the one he wants and she will give it exactly like he wants her to. Concerned, Ava tries to deflect saying its late and she’s tired so she will deal with it tomorrow. However, Cates shuts her down saying he has 48 hours to get the case together. So, he tells Ava on no uncertain times they are going to start now to perfect her statement.\n\nLaura (Genie Francis) has been summoned to Silver Springs by Lulu’s doctor. Fearing the worst, Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura show up. Laura finds her brother Cyrus (Jeff Kober) there, too. Meanwhile at Sam’s (Kelly Monaco) place, Rocco (Finn Carr) tells Dante (Dominic Zamprogna, he is waiting to hear his mother’s voice again and for her to wake up one day. Back at Silver Springs, when the doctor arrives, she tells Laura that Lulu’s liver is compromised and if it continues her liver will fail. Laura asks if her daughter is going to die, and we fade to black.\n\nSo, is Agent Cates about to have a rude awakening? Will his plot to force a statement out of Ava fail miserably? Will Lulu wake up sooner than later? Comment below. But first, check out the touching scenes featuring Finn Carr and Dominic Zamprogna from today’s GH.\n\nIt was 35 years ago on this day, August 20th, 1989, that Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Kitty and Jose Menendez in their home in Beverly Hills.\n\nNow on August 20th, 2024, the highly-anticipated limited series Monsters season two from Ryan Murphy, unveils the premiere date for the story centering around the brothers and the murder case along with its first trailer.\n\nGeneral Hospital fans are extremely excited and intrigued for the upcoming series, and to see Nicholas Chavez (ex-Spencer Cassadine) in one of the leading roles as Lyle Menendez.\n\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story drops on Netflix beginning on September 19th. Chavez took to his Instagram account and posted the trailer accompanied by his words in the post, “So excited holy heck!”\n\nSeptember will be a busy month for Chavez fans as not only can he be seen on Monsters, but also as previously revealed, Nicholas is part of the cast of another Ryan Murphy series, Grotesquerie in which he plays Father Charlie. The horror drama will air on Wednesdays starting September 25 on FX and then the next day on Hulu.\n\nChavez finished his three-year run as GH’s Spencer Cassadine back at the beginning of 2024 when on-screen the character went overboard while trying to save the love of his life Trina (Tabyana Ali) and is presumed dead.\n\nIn ‘Monsters,’ the series delves into how the Menendez Brothers, who were aged 21 and 18 when they committed the crime. claimed they acted in self-defense, after years of physical and sexual abuse.
