        "text": "General Hospital (GH) spoilers indicate that Blair Cramer will storm into Port Charles very soon, to cause some chaos. Played by the popular soap actress, Kassie DePaiva, many GH fans may not be familiar with either the actress or the legendary character she’s playing.\n\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers – A “Refresher” On Blair Cramer.\n\nThe character of Blair Cramer originated on One Life To Live (OLTL). The character debuted in 1991 and was first played by actress Mia Korf.\n\nDePaiva would step into the role two years later and continue with the daytime drama until its final show on ABC in 2012.\n\nInterestingly enough, Ms. Cramer had a whirlwind love affair with Todd Manning, who was once played by actor Roger Howarth (Austin Gatlin-Holt).\n\nPlus, this isn’t the first time Blair has traveled to Port Charles. Ms. Cramer came to the small town in 2012 when her daughter with Todd, Starr Manning (Kristen Alderson) was in a car accident, which claimed the life of her baby’s daddy Cole Thornhart (Van Hughes), and their daughter Hope.\n\nThis helped usher in Starr’s arrival to GH from OLTL; however, a lawsuit from Prospect Park stopped the inter-soap storyline mingling, and actress Kristen Alderson (among other OLTL actors on GH at the time) exited the role, only to return as Kiki Jerome, shortly after.\n\nGH Spoilers – More Interesting Blair Cramer Facts\n\nThere’s been a buzz that Blair Cramer is indeed Martin Grey’s (Michael E. Knight) over-the-top ex-wife, and a recent report confirms this.\n\nREAD THIS: Find out what happens next on General Hospital.\n\nStill, could Blair’s return also signal another OLTL comeback? Back in November 2012, Skye Quartermaine (Robin Christopher) and Carly Spencer (Laura Wright) saw a photo of Blair announcing her engagement to Tomás Delgado, who looked exactly like the ladies’ ex and former villain Lorenzo Alcazar.\n\nOf course, actor Ted King played both roles at one point, but the entire scene did raise a few eyebrows from fans.\n\nThis GH memory has faded over the years but recently resurfaced with Ms. Cramer’s return. After all, with all the question marks around who’s behind Pikeman, and a target on Sonny Corinthos’ (Maurice Benard) back, all arrows point to the idea that Blair’s comeback could mean that Lorenzo is returning, too.\n\nAre you excited about Blair Cramer’s arrival in Port Charles?
