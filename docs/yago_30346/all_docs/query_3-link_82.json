        "text": "With news that One Life to Live’s Blair Cramer is headed to General Hospital, following in the footsteps of daughter Starr, Starr’s dad, Todd, lawyer Nora, and cop John, not to mention All My Children’s Jackson and Ryan’s Hope Delia, we had to ask: How do you feel when refugees from other ABC soaps pop up in Port Charles?\n\nGeneral Hospital Polling\n\nWe’re OK with Blair (Kassie DePaiva) and Jackson (Walt Willey), 8% parse, but, after that, enough is enough. Todd (Roger Howarth), John (Michael Easton), and Starr (Kristen Alderson) didn’t stick around long, which was fine by us. There are tons of popular GH characters who don’t get the airtime they deserve. Clogging up the canvas won’t help.\n\nGH: Naming Names\n\nFor 27% of the audience, the time being devoted to Blair and Jackson could better be spent giving Spencer (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and Trina (Tabyana Ali) the summer of love they’ve so far been deprived of. Or letting Tracy (Jane Elliot) knock a few Quartermaine heads together. Or giving Selina (Lydia Look) the romance she so deserves. Those OLTL and AMC folks had best get in line. Or, better yet, head straight back out of town.\n\nGeneral Hospital: Gimme, Gimmer, Gimme\n\nOn the other hand, a winning 65% is thrilled. You’ve missed your Llanview and Pine Valley friends so much! You’d love to see the entire cast make their way to upstate New York, but you’ll settle for what you can get. Maybe when Blair shows up, she can catch us up on what Dorian (Robin Strasser) and Viki (Erika Slezak) are up to.\n\nAnd when Jack returns for the rest of the trial, he better have an Erica (Susan Lucci) update. Maybe his daughter, Greenlee (Rebecca Budig), can drop by for a visit, too. Just as long as she steers clear of Finn (Michael Easton). Blair should also avoid Austin (Roger Howarth). Less for their sakes, than for ours. Soap fans’ heads might explode."
