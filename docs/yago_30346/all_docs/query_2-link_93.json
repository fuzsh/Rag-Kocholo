        "text": "Tristan Don Manning’s parents, Donald Eric Manning and Dana (Miller) Ramming were blessed with his arrival on October 21, 2004, in Norman Oklahoma. All his family and friends are grieving his sudden passing in Oklahoma City, OK on Sunday, October 9, 2022, just days short of his 18th birthday.\n\nTristan was a Junior at Lindsay High School; his favorite sport was basketball. He was proud to be a Leopard football player, active on the academic team, the choir, on student council, and a member of National Honor Society. In the past year, Tristan accepted Jesus into his heart and found a new outlook for the life he wanted for himself. He started the push towards his goals with power lifting, re-joined the football team and recently, despite his fear of needles, decided to work on getting his Blood Donor Honor Cord. Tristan is a huge inspiration to us all and will be greatly missed.\n\nTristan’s signature greeting to show his love for his family was a big hug when he saw you or an “I Love You” when he left. Whether he was playing cars, Legos, horses with his nieces and little cousins, laying in the floor letting them climb all over him or wrestling with the others, he was truly a gentle giant. It wasn’t just his family he loved, Tristan enjoyed chauffeuring his friends while trying to keep them “in line” and had a smile or a kind word for everyone. To know Tristan was to Love him.\n\nThose left behind to cherish the many memories of Tristan are his mom and bonus dad, Dana and Randy Ramming; siblings Coty and Heather Ramming, Brittany and Austin Peshel, Jakub Vaughn, Broty Ramming, and Peyton Manning; nieces Paizlea and Lyndee Mae Peshel.\n\nMaternal grandparents, Dewanna (Lynn) & Dewayne Miller; Aunt/Uncle Anthony & Brittany Miller, and Kris Miller; Cousins Wyatt Linton, and Landon & Dallas\n\nPaternal Grandparents, Don & Linda Manning; Aunt/Uncle Shelly & Troy Kirkland; Cousins Ashton & Todd Manning, Tyann and Jesse\n\nGrandparents Bud & Linda Ramming and Brenda & Charles Morrow; Aunt & Uncle MaLinda & Brian Carr; Cousins Hailey and Anthony Rohn, Casey Farrow, and Kyle & Danielle Carr\n\nHonorary family members Rusty & Brandi Geter and Racee Jo Geter and a host of second cousins.\n\nTristan was preceded in death by his father, Donald “Eric” Manning and Uncle Jeffrey Don Manning.\n\nFuneral Services will be held at 2:00 PM Friday, October 14, 2022 at the Leopard Arena with Detrick Watts sharing words of comfort to family and friends. Burial will be in the Green Hill Cemetery Lindsay, OK under the direction of John W Williams of Winans Funeral Home, Maysville, OK.
