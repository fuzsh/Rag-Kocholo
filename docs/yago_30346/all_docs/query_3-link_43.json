        "text": "Olin and Rhoda Cramer P’72 ’75 held a deep love for Blair Academy and were enormously proud to have their youngest children, Carl ’72 and Anne ’75, receive their high school education at Blair. After their children graduated, Olin and Rhoda continued to be generous and loyal benefactors, supporting the School’s mission to make a life-changing education accessible to a wide range of students from various backgrounds, regardless of their financial circumstances. When the family lost Rhoda in 1990, Olin maintained a strong connection to Blair, visiting campus for rounds of golf and remaining particularly knowledgeable of current events on the hilltop because of his children’s continued service to the School—Carl as a former Board of Governors member and class representative and Anne as a current Board of Trustees member.\n\nSadly, Olin passed away at the age of 98 last year, and to cement his and Rhoda’s undying support to Blair, he left a bequest to the School in his will. With the generous gift of $1 million, their children thought it would be most fitting to give a portion to the construction of the future Center for Health and Well-Being and the remainder to establish a scholarship in their parents’ name.\n\nGiven that the health and wellness of the community is a top priority at Blair, the School has begun a new building project—a Center for Health and Well-Being connected to Hardwick Hall. This new facility will allow our health-services and counseling teams to occupy the same space for the first time in School history and will include areas where students can access health resources, study and socialize. Anne feels that this new project would have aligned with her mother’s values. “Mom made everything happen for the family, and she was always alert to how her children were doing,” Anne explained. “She saw us through a lot of challenges and would be there for us no matter what, and that really resonates with Blair’s mission for the Center.”\n\n“Our father would want to see that the money is being well spent, but Mom would be ‘All In’ to the higher purpose of health and well-being,” Carl agreed. The Cramers’ gift, along with many others from loyal supporters, will ensure the success of Blair’s newest building project, with a goal of breaking ground in summer 2024. In honor of their contribution, the second floor wellness area in the new building will be named after Olin and Rhoda Cramer.

Olin and Rhoda were both first-generation college attendees at a time when, post-Depression, the ability to go to college was remarkable. They both placed a high value on education, especially a Blair education, and instilled it in all of their children. As a young student, Carl admitted he had believed for some time that it was Olin who had lovingly guided him to Blair, to learn much later in life that his mother was the driving force behind the decision.\n\n“They were quite impressed with the quality of education that Blair offered,” Carl said of his parents’ love for the School. “My father strongly believed an education was one of the few things that, once you have it, can’t be taken away from you. That was a recurring refrain from him in terms of encouraging me to ensure my own children are well-educated.”\n\nAnne shared how community-minded her parents were throughout their lives and how Blair became a part of their community. While her children were at Blair, Rhoda, in particular, became close with the faculty and appreciated the level of attention and quality of instruction she saw on campus. “My parents were gracious to all people,” Anne remembered fondly. “They shared the sense of community Blair has and it was something they always wanted to support.”\n\nOlin continued to hold the Blair community close to his heart in his later years. He was quick to check in with Anne as a member of the Board about financial aid and the opportunities offered to Blair students. In planning his gift, he was enthusiastic about supporting scholarship, but didn’t want to restrict his gift, trusting the decision to his children and the Board.\n\n“Our parents were well off, but they lived modestly, saving their money and investing it wisely,” Carl explained, when asked what future scholarship recipients should know about Olin and Rhoda. “They invested wisely so recipients would be able to have the opportunity to receive a world-class education, understanding that it’s not what you have in life that matters, it’s how you live it.”"
