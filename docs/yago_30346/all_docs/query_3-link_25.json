        "text": "In 2012, ABC moved DePaiva's Blair, Roger Howarth's Todd Manning, Kristen Alderson's Starr Manning, and Michael Easton's John McBain from One Life to Live to General Hospital after the cancellation of OLTL.\n\nSome protracted legal squabbles, which have since been resolved, resulted in GH writing out the former Llanview residents and giving the actors brand-new roles (Alderson went on to play Kiki Jerome, while Howarth became Franco Baldwin and eventually Austin Gatlin-Holt. Easton morphed into Silas Clay and currently plays Hamilton Finn.)\n\nInterestingly enough, DePaiva talked about a possible General Hospital return in a recent chat with Soap Opera Digest.\n\n\"There's a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge,\" DePaiva told Digest. \"But I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn't recognize me. But I could go, 'You're hot. You look like somebody I used to know.'\"\n\nDePaiva recently made a one-day appearance on Days of our Lives, where she reprised her role as Eve Donovan. DePaiva first played the DAYS role in 2014.\n\nDePaiva made her first appearance as One Life to Live's Blair Cramer on December 15, 1993, and the actress remained with the ABC soap through its final episode in January 2012.\n\nBlair's pop-up is the latest from a fan favorite of ABC's former soaps. Walt Willey has made a handful of appearances as All My Children's Jackson Montgomery over the past month. One Life to Live's Hillary B. Smith (Nora Buchanan) made the trek from Llanview for a handful of appearances in 2017 and 2019. Florencia Lozano's TÃ©a Delgado also appeared briefly in 2012.\n\nAn exact first airdate for DePaiva's big GH return hasn't been announced. TVLine, which first reported DePaiva's return to GH, says the appearance will be a \"brief stint\" during the month of September."
