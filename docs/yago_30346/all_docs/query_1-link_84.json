        "text": "Quite a few classic videos have been uploaded in their entirety lately. Karen turning tricks at the Wallington Hotel and is caught by Viki. It leads to Karen's famous breakdown scene on the witness stand.\n\nI love the spunky Viki in these episodes. She's powerful and clever. I'm not sure why she was so taken by the needy, clingy Karen.\n\nViki provides comfort during their heart-to-heart chats: \"Karen, don't forget in the past I was a bigger whore than you ever were\".\n\nR61 funny I’m a huge DAYS fan too but have been watching 1994 AMC episodes and it’s so good with the Jane Cox/Janet Green (played by the underrated soap hopper Robin Mattson) reconstructive surgery storyline and her Mom Wilma Marlowe (who should be a Datalounger) and the insufferable Felicity LaFortune as Laurel, it’s great camp\n\nTrevor just started choking the shot out of Jane after finding out she’s really Janet the crowbar killer out of the mental hospital, at the altar in front of all of Pine Valley\n\nIt’s classic soap opera, although the camp value and the fact that all of Pine Valley is dumbed down for this storyline puts it more into a more Days of Our Lives type storyline than classic AMC\n\nThey had to think of something outlandish as they were competing with James Reilly’s DAYS at that time\n\nAnd can we also agree that Laurel was the original “Karen”, even her hairdo says “Karen”\n\nR65 she was awful, I was rooting for Janet and even Kendall Hart, remember they joined forces after Kendall found out “Jane” was Janet during the big tornado?\n\nShe was always up Trevor and little Timmy’s ass and in Jane and Kendall’s business\n\nWhy are you guys so friendly, what are they up to? I have to go an investigate since I have no life of my own!\n\nShe even had the obligatory Karen accessory, THE AUTISTIC CHILD, With her daughter Lilly\n\nShe was horrible\n\nHer acting after Jane/Janet cut her car tires to kill her and shut her up in the hospital when she woke up from her coma was laughably bad\n\nI just remember her pointing to “Jane” and trying to scream out “Jjjaneet”\n\nAnd of course Trevor, Timmy, Jackson even Dimitri are all in the hospital room and are all like “What is she trying to tell us?”\n\nR67 they did and headwriter James Reilly, when he gave interviews, always mentioned AMC being his favorite soap opera, I believe Agnes Nixon hired him as one of AMC’s writer’s in the early 80s after he sent her a note telling her how much he loved the show\n\nHe wrote Edna on Passions specifically for Kathleen Noone to play because he was a fan of her as Ellen on AMC in the 80s, Noone has said this in interviews. He specifically wrote EJ on DAYS in 2006 to be played by James Scott because Reilly likes him so much as Ethan On AMC\n\nThen a few months later Reilly got fired from DAYS\n\nI like seeing how soaps changed due to writing, production, and actor changes. A show could transform from a melodrama into a romantic comedy within three months.\n\nI'm currently watching late-80s OLTL. The show is all about the Perils of Sarah and Megan Gordon, with some Tina and Gabrielle machinations sprinkled in. Viki shows up a couple of days a week to purr soothingly. Cord stalks through rooms to reprimand Tina. Max is around mainly to blow smoke up Megan's ass and to lustily insult Gabrielle (just fuck already!)\n\nWhatever scenery Asa leaves un-chewed is devoured by Michael Grande. Renee is constantly ringing her hands (I can't believe she was a very good madam back when she was running hoes. She's too damn anxious and excitable). Clint sleepwalks through most scenes, only waking up when his brother, Bo, or their Pa is around. Monticello's Raven Alexander shows up a few times a month in the guise of Melinda Cramer, but the role is, sadly, rather forgettable.\n\nI'm really enjoying it so far. I grew up watching Another World at 2pm, so getting to see the storylines my friends talked about is cool.\n\nR72 and R75- I was a little OLTL freak from the 4th to 9th grades and late 80's OLTL ruled.\n\nInterestingly enough, Megan and Sarah really did take over 1989, while OLTL was definitely Andrea's show from 86-88..\n\nIt's a shame that the stalker thing pushed her out.\n\nAnd the unsung hero of that show was Fiona Hutchison as Gabrielle- she goes to the forefront shortly... And this was the summer coming up when Llanview has the prison break. It's a camp classic.\n\nAnd I find Phil Carey utterly hilarious- he had some damn good lines.\n\nThe show also had some of the best background music ever during the 80's. Very keyboard/synth heavy and contemporary.\n\nEllen Holly felt that her contributions were undervalued and that she was disrespected over and over. She called them out and got called crazy for it.. Now, I think that Ellen Holly was a little naïve to believe that a black character was going to lead a daytime soap in the late 60s and 70s and overvalued what her character meant to that show at that time, but her naiveite and ego doesn't excuse the way she was treated.\n\nSame thing with Rowell and a lot of her complaints about Y&R has been the foundation of this movement by black actors in the last few years.\n\nR75 and R76, watching this era of the show is very interesting. Getting used to Jensen Buchanan crying in every scene has been dizzying. I knew her only as Vicky from Another World (and not even MY Vicky -- that was Anne Heche) but I can see why Jensen forced P&G to transform Vicky into more of a heroine than a vixen. Poor Sarah just wasn't safe.\n\nI agree about Fiona Hutchison. She's my favorite. Andrea Evans is great and rightly got a lot of attention, but I feel for Hutchison's Gabrielle so much. She never seems to be able to catch a break. I love that she came on the show as basically a stalker -- as Max's obsessed fan, lol. Max was always a gorgeous dirt bag, and I love hating him. I always wanted Gabrielle or Blair to kill him. Blair tried.\n\nOn the day Todd returned to Llanview after eight years in the Supa Sekrit Location, Marty passed him by and got on a plane to be with Patrick, who had apparently been in hiding. I really expected Roger and Susan to have a brief (maybe comically bittersweet) scene -- especially since Marty was totally looney tunes at that point. She probably would have thought she was hallucinating or something. I was disappointed when it didn't happen.\n\nI don't think Roger would have played the scene for laughs, either. He always took the gang rape storyline very seriously. I imagine Todd running into Marty would have been poignant, especially when he realized that she was mentally unwell.\n\nR175. Nails it.\n\nI would love to interview Jensen and see what the fuck happened to her- Like a deep dive.\n\nI know she married a wealthy agent? Producer? They divorced and she drove drunk.\n\nAnd I also try to remember that she was on AW for far longer than she was ever on OLTL.. Most fans remember her from that show- not OLTL (AW was a show I never even sampled for an episode, (I checked out ATWT sometimes for Elizabeth Hubbard)\n\nThose 1989 OLTL episodes have reawakened by subconscious or some shit. I was such a massive fan of that show then.\n\nAnd at the tender age of 12 I did not feel that the Gordon sisters were \"eating up the show\". I dug them both, in addition to Andrea, Fiona, And Erika.\n\nThat Audrey chick was HORRIBLE though. Blech.\n\nJohn Martin- Such a boring actor but what a fucking HOTTIE.\n\nI remember watching that very episode that dude posted (sometime in June of 2021) and that dipshit paralyzed bore Audrey was trying to walk and his character was like \"come on you can do it!\" and my really cool neighbor lady was over visiting my mom (my mom could barely stand her) and she said something like \"Shit! I would learn how to walk for that stud!\" And was thinking, Hell yeah. He's hot as fuck!\n\nAnd upon a a lot of reviewing of OLTL on Youtube over the last few years- other than the incredible production values (the cinematic lighting alone, made Gottlieb's OLTL impeccable) I really do not enjoy the Malone/ Gottlieb era remotely as I did Rauch's 80's version.\n\nThe background music SUCKED BALLS (other than Carlo/Alex's/ Todd's theme/ and this early Blair Daimler theme- I am talking Mia Korf- it was really good music- it was around 92-93 when Addy was introduced)\n\nMarty's rape/ Alex/Carlo/Andrew/And Viki and the alters were the ONLY good stories in that 92-94 era. The rest was GARBAGE- and so, so, so boring.\n\nBut that being said- as someone mentioned above- The Gottlieb era was CLASSY- very, very classy. The show looked and behaved elegantly (generally boring) it was contemporary, and it was very cinematic. I remember critics saying the show became literary. (Thanks to being written by a writer) But my god it was uniformly boring.\n\nGo and luck at the supporting characters on OLTL in the early 90's- just horrible. Suede? The dude from Starship Troopers? It was really bad.\n\nNot bad ideas, R190. I've always believed that part of the reason soaps declined is that writers no longer knew how to write for the legacy characters. Viki's son were sidelined by Todd Manning and Rex Balsom--hell, even David Vickers got more play. The Buchanan men should have driven storylines for years to come, yet they were either badly cast, IMO, or tossed aside when cast well. Dan Gauthier should have been a leading man. He had enough grit to go up against St. John AND/OR Howarth, IMO.\n\nSame thing on another of my shows, Another World. For some reason, the writing for Jamie Frame was inconsistent. Why could the show not determine who Jamie was? As the son of the show's lead, he should have been fleshed out from early on, yet his character and motivations seemed to change from writer to writer, as well as from actor to actor. Characters like Jake and Cass outshone Jamie, and that should never have been. Yet Jamie became a supporting character until he was simply ... gone.\n\nGuiding Light seemed to have trouble for a while too with casting legacy kids, at least until the end. I did like Jeff Branson as Shayne Lewis and Daniel Cosgrove as Bill Lewis (despite me considering him a show-killer since he was on several favorites in their latter years, I always like Cosgrove when I see him. In fact, I think he would have been a good Joe Buchanan.)\n\nThe problem with \"legacy\" kids is that often the network and /or production company don't want to dirty them up. You can understand why a network, in the 90s, wouldn't want Joey Buchanan to be gay, but it is limiting. Over on Days, turning saintly Marlena Evans daughter into a hellion was genius. Think of how much more interesting Kevin Buchanan would have been as a \"Todd\" type character. Hell, they could have even cast Howarth in the role.\n\nAnd since you brought up Jamie Frame. Last summer, I revisited Laurence Lau's portrayal and it was very good as seen through older eyes with some perspective. Much better than I had originally given him credit for. Anne Heche really brought something out in him.\n\nR202, networks began taking less chances from the 90s onward. Watching clips of soaps from the 70s is great. They took so many more chances than the shows do now. They were less afraid of backlash. Plus, there were no social media warriors to cater to.\n\nSami Brady's transformation into bitch-terror was the last time I truly enjoyed DAYS. Watching her scheme was hilarious. And I loved every time boring Carrie would figure things out and punch Sami in the face, lol.\n\nI agree that Howarth could have played Kevin. Young Howarth was very good at the kind of arrogant, spoiled, big man on campus type OLTL's Kevin might have morphed into given his privilege. His Kevin might not have been as psychotic as Todd was, but more the type to expect Mom and Pa to bail him out of continuous scrapes. Can't you just envision scenes of Howarth charming Slezak despite her misgivings -- knowing that her son really ain't shit, but loving him anyway?\n\nI'll be sure to check out some late 80s Another World to remind myself of the Lau/Heche dynamic. Heche ate that show up -- in a good way.\n\nI still believe Jamie Frame, just on the strength of his legacy, should never have needed love interests to be interesting or compelling. Whether he was played by Dekins, Yates, Lau, Todd or someone else, Jamie should have had an identity that was recognizable despite who played him. I can tell you who Jake McKinnon was. Jamie Frame seems to have changed depending on who was writing for him or playing the role.\n\nTodd Manning (in his early years, anyway) was popular because he was a reflection of the Id run amok. He did whatever he wanted to do. Right or wrong. He was pretty much fearless ... unless you were Peter Manning, the adopted father who abused him. Everyone else was fair game.\n\nI think that appealed to much of the audience because many people have the urge to fearlessly commit bad deeds. Todd raped, manslaughtered, kidnapped, stalked, blackmailed, held hostages, threatened, fought, committed domestic abuse, escaped imprisonment, and a host of other actions and crimes. Pure psychopathic rage on parade.\n\nHe also inherited $27 million dollars, started a successful business, fell in love a few times (whatever love means to Todd), created children, provided comic relief and pathos, and rolled his eyes along with the audience when his storylines went off the rails.\n\nTodd Manning was terrifying for a few years before Roger Howarth and the writers remade him into a buffoon with a thirst for pettiness and revenge. For a while, he was the scariest thing on daytime ... maybe all of television in the early 90s.\n\n[quote]Todd Manning was terrifying for a few years before Roger Howarth and the writers remade him into a buffoon with a thirst for pettiness and revenge. For a while, he was the scariest thing on daytime ... maybe all of television in the early 90s.\n\nIn other words, while Michael Malone was writing the character.\n\nSubsequent writers didn't know how to capture that rage properly, so they tried to lighten him up. Giving him a parrot to talk to or having him pretend to have an alter named Rod.\n\n[quote] Soap viewers had a disturbing habit of making rapists popular.\n\nBernie Sanders got in trouble for saying it, but many women have rape fantasies. That doesn't mean they want to be raped in reality, but many have the fantasy of being taken against their will. I remember when Craigslist was a thing, you could always find women posting on there wanting you to \"break\" in their house and rape them.\n\nAt least Todd was attractive, I've never for the life of me figured out why so many women were crazy over Luke Spencer.\n\nAlmost all of ABC's soaps were/are sister soaps. GH, OLTL, AMC, Loving/The City, Ryan's Hope, Port Charles and The Young Marrieds, have all been tied together as taking place in the same universe at one time or another and sharing characters. Early on OLTL had Dr. Steve Hardy come to town and consult on a case. Marco Dane spent years in both Llanview and Port Charles. Skye was on AMC, OLTL, and GH. Tracy was on GH and The City. Anna was on GH and AMC. Ava has been established as being the daughter of a Ryan's Hope legacy character. The Young Marrieds neighborhood has been established as being a suburb of Port Charles\n\nYep. Both Y&R and Days are owned by (then) Screen Gem/Columbia now Sony. Corday owns a piece of Y&R. Y&R was developed with help from Betty Corday when it was still \"The Innocent Years\" and was, I believe, pitched to NBC before CBS showed interest wanting to bring some youth to their lineup. Which is funny given how CBS eventually ended up. The Corday and Bells are still close, even though it kind of messy for a bit when Bell wanted to leave Days altogether to focus on Y&R. They worked out a deal so that Bell would remain Story Consultant. Tying this back to OLTL, Bell and Nixon were both Irna Phillips proteges. Bell helped get Nixon to Another World and with her success there she was able to create OLTL for ABC.\n\nI believe OLTL and AMC were across the river from each other, but both towns on the Main Line.\n\nR296 DAYS went the camp route and was doing GH type stories better than GH by the late 80s\n\nI think both OLTL and DAYS were the two soaps that copied the most off Gloria Monty era GH\n\nOLTL had that secret underground world beneath Llantano manor, that’s some Days of Our Lives type of stories\n\nBoth OLTL and DAYS had characters who time traveled to the Wild West Storylines in the late 80s\n\nI know Maggie Depriest was headwriter on DAYS during the extremely popular and colorful mid 80s supercouples saving the world period and then she went to OLTL as headwriter\n\nAs other have said, Days had to change course to survive. They recruited the GH writers and out GHed GH and saved the show. Up until that point, Days and YR were close in tone, pacing, and just about everything else.\n\nI wouldn't say that OLTL copied GH like Days did, I just think they adjusted to be more compatible so that it could be a better bridge soap between AMC and GH and to save itself. People were always coming for OLTL. There is a reason why it was always called the red-headed stepchild of ABC daytime. OLTL's ratings weren't bad, but it was a true time slot hit. During the 80s, ABC could have put a test pattern in that slot and it would have pulled a 30 share.\n\nAt the time, the rumors were that Gloria Monty was developing another show and was pressuring ABC for that OLTL slot.\n\nABC asked for changes, dumped more money into it and put the show on in primetime during the summer of 83, but it didn't get a lot of interest. Gloria then tried to get it back to daytime sandwiched between GH and AMC where she originally wanted it, but it was deemed too expensive, and they had already greenlighted Loving from Agnes Nixon and Doug Marland with big hopes for that show, but it all fell apart because Doug and Agnes' relationship deteriorated. So OLTL kept on chugging along and by that time had gotten renewed interest because of Paul Rauch's over the top stories and improved production values.\n\nGloria ended up getting more money and power and GH and one of those development deals that never went anywhere for more money.\n\nIn 1981, Days had terribly ratings. They hired Pat Falken Smith to be HW with the instructions to reinvent the show\n\nPat Falken Smith previously been HW of Days (1975-77), immediately after Bill Bell left. She had also been HW of GH (1979-81) during the Luke and Laura on the run period and Ice Princess saga. Thus, she knew Days history well and also knew what had worked at GH when it was at the height of its ratings.\n\nSo, she reimagined the show in the mold of GH, introducing Roman Brady, Tony DiMera and their respective families, gradually. Stephano arrived on the scene in spring 1982. Soon after Roman and Marlena were proving popular and the show made them into a super-couple a la Luke and Laura. By 1983, Bo and Hope were on the show in line to become the next super couple. By 1984, Shane Donovan was on the scene, Salem's answer to Robert Scorpio. Also in 1984, we first heard mention of the ISA, Salem's answer to GH's WSB.\n\nSo, for the past 40 years, Days and GH would definitely be considered the closest to being sister soaps.\n\nIts so funny to me that OLTL was the red headed step child, yet was so amazingly watchable from 1977-1981 and 1985-1990, 92-95.. It was a great show at many points, and at its best - was as good or better than fucking overrated as fuck AMC and Rape Me Luke, GH.\n\nTo me 1985-86 OLTL was the most underrated soap of all time. Upon viewing Youtube, etc. I think Peggy O'Shea was an amazing headwriter, and by far OLTL's most underrated.\n\nI never \"got\" AMC hokey charms or ever really LOVED GH the way I did OLTL (and Y&R).\n\nAbsolutely R302, and the highest rated. Viewers were actually growing- it was kind of unheard of at that point.\n\nAnd something everyone forgets as they laud AMC and AMC being so good in its reboot on Prospect Park (And I believe those reviews) I did not enjoy the OLTL reboot much..\n\nAnyway-OLTL's finale ratings kicked AMC's ass. AMC- the gold standard- got lower ratings for its finale than OLTL.\n\nTo me, that says a lot. OLTL truly had more engaged viewers at the end of its run.\n\nOLTL viewers watched until the end.\n\nI was looking up Agnes Nixon interviews and I came across a People magazine interview from 1975 and in it she said that she makes sure to watch Days of Our Lives everyday “because I like to keep up with the competition and it’s a really good show”. That was when her mentor Bill Bell was headwriter , and around he time DAYS became the first soap to have an interracial romance between white David Banning ( Julie’s son) and black Valerie Grant, their son Eli is currently on the show, I wonder what Agnes thought of that storyline and if she wishes she had one it first on AMC or OLTL\n\nDid Agnes do the interracial thing first with Carla involved with Jim Craig, or do I have that wrong? Or was Carla, who we thought was white, interested in the black doctor? I have only read about all of that and can’t remember the details.\n\nAnd was Nancy Grant involved with a white man on AMC, albeit off screen for the most part? This was also in the seventies but Nancy and Frank weren’t major characters.\n\nI could have it all wrong, but this is how I remember it.\n\nWhen the leading female character has multiple personalities, and the actress still manages to snag six Emmys despite that weird, cliched, soapy fact, you know you have something special.\n\nYears ago someone on this board got pissy with me when I said I never cared for General Hospital. I explained I liked OLTL better because it had a hard, dark underbelly. The poster attempted to ridicule me by pointing out that GH is all about the mob and the many murders that come with that business. GH was waaay darker than One Life.\n\nYet I didn't back down. I could never Sonny seriously. He might have had it rough back in the day, but his dad never fucked him as far as I know. THAT'S dark.\n\nI miss our show.\n\nR320- Years ago some article had described OLTL during its various regimes. In the 70's it was called \"Psychological Drama\" and I agree with that assessment for its run overall.\n\nGH- Never got that show. I enjoyed it from 87-90 but ultimately could take it or leave it.\n\nI have mentioned before that AMC is as overrated as my grandmothers donkey balls. (I will say upon seeing some videos on Youtube- I do see why it was a powerhouse in that 82-84 era with Jenny/Gregg/Jessie/Angie- the show had a really warm and homey feel, despite being hokey and looking like a high school play. My mom loved that show.\n\nR321, I'm starting to notice in my Youtube viewings that soaps are best viewed based on various eras of time. Depending on writing regimes or the actors involved, a show could bang or bust. I'm currently watching Guiding Light from 1991; One Life to Live from 1989; and Another World from 1990. All are so good. I must remember to give 1982-84 All My Children a spin. I watched AMC from 93 to 95, but never married it. Stayed mostly to see what Kendall would get up to. I grew up watching the NBC lineup, so I soon returned to DAYS.\n\nGH never caught me. In 1992, when Santa Barbara was canceled, I was looking for a new soap. I watched a week of GH. Then a week of Guiding Light. Guiding Light won, and I stayed with them off and on, even into the Peapack years. The longest GH ever held my attention was during the Cartini regime when OLTL characters visited. I never liked John, or Todd, or Starr enough on their own to stay. After Blair and Tea left, so did I.\n\nR325- I am watching the 1989 OLTL episodes as well- and yeah there is a lot of Megan and Sarah, but I never minded them. It was clear by mid 89 that Andrea had probably told the show she was leaving and they were clearly trying to prepare. Including testing out the horrible and unmemorable Audrey as a potential interest for Cord.\n\nThe show is extremely fast moving and plotty, and generally ALOT happens in each episode. I understand now why I loved the show so much as a young boy-early teen! It still has that addictive quality with well defined characters.\n\nR323 here:\n\nOLTL 1989 is All About the Gordon Sisters, lol. Megan is settling into her split personality and her relationship with Marco Dane; Sarah was just raped by Austin and is currently attempting to hide it from Bo.\n\nI don't understand why she's hiding it, especially since several people -- including Asa -- are aware of the assault. Bo is one of the more understanding guys in Llanview, so Sarah acting like he'll hate her if he discovers the rape makes no sense. He definitely would not have blamed her.\n\nI know the show meant for this storyline to be dramatic, but I'm finding it kind of annoying. Maybe it's because Sarah is played as straight damsel-in-distress. Not fond of those. Some of my favorites heroines and vixens stay in trouble, but I never got the impression that they were weak. Sarah just feels WEAK. Jensen plays it perfectly, but I just don't like her. I want to ... because she's eating the show!\n\nI know things will pick up when they discover Austin isn't dead.\n\nGabrielle is wringing her hands and skulking around Michael Grande and Brenda. She's my favorite character of this period, so I'm looking forward to the buildup of this storyline. Tina seems to be sidelined, but that makes sense (knowing what was happening to Andrea at the time). Viki shows up to provide advice or to coo gently, but she doesn't have much of a story.\n\nI started watching OLTL when Michael Malone was hired, too. It was the proposed Billy Douglas story that drew me in. I'd occasionally clicked to ABC during commercials on AW if I was watching live, and I remember one day Viki saying to Clint, \"Remember, dear, the other day, when we were in the past?\" And I knew this was not a soap for me.\n\nI liked the Billy Douglas story, but I really wished they'd made the story a peninsula, one stemming from Lord-Buchanan family issues instead of from this island comprised of no one the Douglases. They didn't even have a home set, and we were supposed to believe Billy's father was okay with his son's coming out drama unfolding at the Llanview Country Club. Every day I thought, Billy should be Joey Buchanan, so they could have this argument at home.\n\nI liked the Lindsay-Nora-Sam-Bo drama also, but that was later IIRC, with JFP and Megan McTavish. That got terminally spoiled by Mimi Torchin, and I gave up watching soaps Easter weekend of 2000.\n\nLinda Gottlieb on the Billy story:\n\n[quote] We did several groundbreaking stories that I’m really proud of -- the story that culminated with the AIDS quilt, for which I cast Ryan Phillippe as an unknown actor from New Jersey. I really wanted one of the Buchanans to come out as gay, but the network wouldn’t let me do that. They had never let the quilt travel -- it was really groundbreaking. And we got all these letters from people telling us what those episodes meant to them. This was a time when no one was doing this kind of thing, you understand -- there was no Will & Grace, nothing. It really was a serious breakthrough.\n\nFrom Llanview in the Afternoon: An Oral History of One Life to Live\n\nR343- Then and now, I found it boring. Groundbreaking- yes- Well written- definitely- but it just wasn't my cup of tea. In fact, I liked it more then than on rewatch on Youtube.\n\nEven Gottlieb's background music was boring.\n\nThe show may have been contemporary, but it had NO edge.\n\nSo many stupid characters were introduced. Suede, The Starship Troopers guy...\n\nAnd Gottlieb's insistence that they needed short story arcs with brand new characters, was bullshit. Bill Bell called her out on that, and he was right.\n\nI respect that era of OLTL, but I did not particularly enjoy it."
