In March 2012, just two months after OLTL ended its broadcast run on ABC, the actress brought Blair to GH for a multi-month crossover event that also featured her longtime Llanview leading man Roger Howarth, AKA Todd Manning. Coincidentally, Howarth has been starring on GH for much of the past decade in myriad new roles, first as Franco Baldwin (R.I.P.) and, currently, as Austin Gatlin-Holt.\n\nEarlier this month, DePaiva — who recently returned to Days of Our Lives as Eve Donovan — discussed a possible GH return (and the inevitable deja vu with Howarth), telling Soap Opera Digest that she would be game to return to the soap as Blair.\n\n“There’s a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge,” she told to the mag, before acknowledging, “But I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go, ‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.'”\n\nIn July, GH rolled out the welcome mat for fellow ABC soap alum Walt Willey, who reprised his role as All My Children‘s Jackson Montgomery for three episodes. He is set to resurface on GH this week for another arc.\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nStars Who Almost Played Other TV Roles — on Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, Lost, Gilmore Girls, Friends and Other Shows\n\nTV Stars Almost Cast in Other Roles\n\nFall TV Preview: Who's In?
