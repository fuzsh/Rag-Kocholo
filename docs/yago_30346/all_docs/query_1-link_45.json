        "text": "All My Children and One Life to Live are finally heading online, nearly two years after producers at Prospect Park swooped in to save the axed ABC soaps.\n\nThe company announced Monday that both series will be offering daily episodes starting April 29 as a part of its The Online Network. The half-hour formats will be available on Hulu, Hulu Plus and iTunes.\n\n“We thank the fans whose tenaciousness to see these shows return made this historical moment possible,” said Prospect Park partners said Jeff Kwatinetz and Rich Frank. “We are determined to repay their support by delivering new and creatively groundbreaking episodes that both the fans, as well as legions of new viewers, will love. These viewers will absolutely embrace the flexibility Hulu and iTunes provide to watch their shows anywhere, anytime.”\n\nProduction began on All My Children on Feb. 25, with One Life to Live set to return to shooting on March 18 at the same Stamford, Conn., studio. In addition to free daily streaming on Hulu, backlogs will be available to Hulu Plus subscribers and users will also have the option of buying episodes on iTunes.\n\n“I am so pleased that our dream of bringing these two series back to life is coming to fruition,” said Agnes Nixon, the creator of both series who maintains a creative consultant status. “I am grateful to Prospect Park for their unwavering commitment to this project and to the amazingly talented casts of All My Children and One Life to Live — their devotion to these franchises has made this moment possible. And to the fans — well, we wouldn’t be here without you.”\n\nProspect Park also included the most up-to-date cast list for both series, which has seen more additions since the return was formalized.\n\nAll My Children\n\nJulia Barr as Brooke English\n\nRyan Bittle as JR Chandler\n\nDavid Canary as Adam Chandler\n\nLindsay Hartley as Cara Martin\n\nVincent Irizarry as Dr. David Hayward\n\nFrancesca James as Evelyn Johnson\n\nThorsten Kaye as Zach Slater\n\nJordan Lane Price as Celia Fitzgerald\n\nJill Larson as Opal Cortlandt\n\nRay MacDonnell as Dr. Joe Martin\n\nCady McClain as Dixie Cooney\n\nDebbi Morgan as Dr. Angela Hubbard\n\nEric Nelson as AJ Chandler\n\nEden Riegel as Bianca Montgomery\n\nHeather Roop as Jane McIntyre\n\nSal Stowers as Cassandra Foster\n\nDenyse Tontz as Miranda Montgomery\n\nJordi Vilasuso as Griffin Castillo\n\nDarnell Williams as Jesse Hubbard\n\nRobert (Rob) Scott Wilson as Pete “Petey” Cortlandt"
