Victor lives at his ancestral, 18th-century country estate named Llanfair with his daughters Victoria (nicknamed \"Viki\") and Meredith. Victor's wife and Victoria and Meredith's mother, Eugenia Randolph Lord, dies while giving birth to Meredith. With no son to succeed him, Victor concentrates on grooming elder Viki strictly, with her position as legal heiress to his fortune. As a result of this lifelong pressure, Viki, newly arrived from college, allows herself little time for romantic entanglements, focusing her energy on her inherited media career and her father's approval. Conversely, frail and emotional, yet free-spirited Meredith, all but overlooked by Victor, sought escape from his oppression and the future he had laid out for his daughters.\n\nLord Enterprises, Inc.\n\n[edit]\n\nLord Enterprises, Inc. are the legacy media assets of Victor Lord,[4][10] including The Banner daily newspaper, WVL/WVLE-TV, WVLE radio, and life interest of the Llanfair estate. Victor's heiress daughter, Victoria, inherits publishing rights to the Banner newspaper as a part of Victor's initial will in 1976. Dorian Cramer Lord is initially bequeathed the landed Llanfair estate and part-ownership of WVL/WVLE-TV, WVLE radio, and The Banner; Viki purchases Dorian's stake in the newspaper soon after Victor's death. Victor's nephew Richard Abbott is appointed head of the European bureau of The Banner in 1979 by Viki's then-husband Joe Riley. The landed estate and majority ownership of the broadcast media outlets revert to Victoria in 1982 due to a codicil stipulating Llanfair and legacy assets return to the legal biological Lord heir (1976) if Victor's spouse remarries, which Dorian does at Llanfair with attorney Herb Callison that year. Dorian continues to live at Llanfair until she is forcibly removed by Viki's new husband, Clint Buchanan later that year. Tina Lord (formerly Tina Clayton) gains rightful access to the estate when Victor reveals her paternity to him in a letter during The Banner newspaper's 50th anniversary celebrations in 1985. Richard briefly takes over the company when Viki suffers a recurrent bout with her mental illness in 1986. Todd Manning is revealed to be Victor's illegitimate son and rightful male heir in 1995, gaining him partial ownership of WVLE radio, access to Llanfair, and an inherited trust of $30 million.\n\nThe Sun tabloid newspaper (formerly Dorian's The Intruder) is bought and edited by Todd Manning with millions of dollars in inheritance bequeathed to him at the revelation of his paternity to Victor in 1995; Todd's twin brother, Victor Lord Jr., assumes ownership of Todd's assets (under his brother's identity) from 2003 until Victor Jr.'s apparent death in 2011. Victor Jr.'s assets are betrothed to Irene Manning as part of Victor Jr.'s will, access which then reverts to legal heiress Tina at Irene's death in October 2011. Later in court proceedings, Tina relinquishes control of Todd's assets, returning them to Todd. Concurrently in October 2011, Jack Manning is named executive assistant and editor for The Sun by Victor Jr., a position he keeps when Todd returns to work for the company. Jessica Buchanan reports for both her grandfather and mother's newspaper, The Banner, and her uncle's tabloid, The Sun, at various times in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nTodd founds subsidiary Manning Enterprises in June 2012, purchasing Port Charles publications Crimson magazine and The Port Charles Sun (formerly The Port Charles Press) newspaper. Upon the Todd's exit from Port Charles, his Port Charles acquisitions revert to their former names and prior ownerships.\n\nCompanies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Banner – Chief daily newspaper for Llanview, Pennsylvania with a European bureau in Paris\n\nThe Sun – Tabloid newspaper in Llanview and primary competitor of The Banner (formerly The Intruder)\n\nWVL/WVLE-TV – Local television station which produces news, talk, and television programming in Llanview\n\nWVLE – Radio station for Llanview University and surrounding community\n\nManning Enterprises – Port Charles, New York publications Crimson magazine and The Port Charles Sun (formerly The Port Charles Press) tabloid, a cable television franchise, a sports publication, and two publishing houses (2012–13)\n\nLord/Manning Plant – Power plant owned by Victoria Lord and Clint Buchanan (1984–85)\n\nEmployees and estate trustees\n\n[edit]\n\nChairwoman/CEO: Victoria Lord – Publisher of The Banner newspaper, owner of WVL-TV and WVLE radio\n\nCo-owner: Dorian Lord\n\nCo-owner: Todd Manning – Co-owner of WVLE radio, publisher of The Sun\n\nTrustee: Richard Abbott – Managing editor of the European bureau of The Banner\n\nTrustee: Tina Lord\n\nTrustee: Victor Lord Jr.\n\nTrustee: Kevin Riley Buchanan – Editor of The Banner\n\nTrustee: Joey Riley Buchanan\n\nTrustee: Jessica Buchanan – Journalist for The Banner and The Sun\n\nTrustee: Natalie Buchanan\n\nTrustee: Starr Manning\n\nTrustee: Jack Manning – Editor and executive assistant for The Sun\n\nFamily tree\n\n[edit]\n\nLord family tree\n\nIrene ManningDorothy RandolphVictor LordEugenia Randolph Blair CramerTodd ManningTéa DelgadoVictor Lord Jr.Margaret CochranCord RobertsTina LordLarry WolekMeredith LordTony LordPat AshleyClint BuchananVictoria LordJoe RileyRoger Gordon Starr ManningCole ThornhartDanielle ManningJack ManningSam ManningC.
