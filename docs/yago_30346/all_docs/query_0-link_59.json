        "text": "Here are restaurants from our favorite soaps. What soap restaurants am I missing?\n\nAll My Children\n\nConFusion\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nThe Cellar – a night club\n\nMonaLisa’s\n\nThe Yacht Club\n\nOasis – Night club managed by Eddie Silva\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nThe Bikini Bar – a beach bar where people usually wear swimsuit.\n\nLL Giardino – a nice restaurant, with outside seating, Shelia Carter was a waitress. Deacon purchased it and switched their focus to high class Pizza.\n\nDark Shadows\n\nBlue Whale\n\nCollinsport Inn\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nBrady Pub – Restaurant/Bar run by various members of the Brady family and the main center of the town, the way the hospital is on General Hospital\n\nDoug’s Place – Restaurant/Bar with a nicer selection of booze than the Brady Club. It’s more upper middle class and has a secret window that goes through the bar so they can shoot scenes through the bard into the restaurant\n\nGreen Mountain Lodge was a Salem getaway hotspot in the 1990s. (Soap Opera Digest, March 11, 2019)\n\nJava Cafe – Nicole worked there when she first came to town in 1998 (Soap Opera Digest, July 24, 2017)\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nThe Brown Dog Bar – Another dive bar where Finn was getting drunk and some underage teens came in because “they never card here.”\n\nCharlie’s Place – A dive bar that has sort of taken the Floating Rib’s place in the story, although in a different location, the Rib still exists. Josslyn Jax loves the fries, Kristina Davis works as a waitress and Julian Jerome bought the place when he became a reformed man after his sister Olivia pushed him over the edge\n\nEckhert’s – I guess it’s a bakery. Curtis stopped at their Donut Window to bring Portia lemon donuts for New Year’s in 2024.\n\nFloating Rib – Luke’s Bar, a dive bar with a little bit of a younger edge, they have pool tables. It exploded and then opened in a new spot.\n\nThe Haunted Star – A nightclub on a yacht.\n\nKelly’s Diner – A 1950s style diner owned by Bobbie Spencer in the late 2010s. It used be famous for egg salad sandwiches. Carly bought the place at a bargain rate to pay what she owed the government for her insider trading conviction.\n\nMetro Court – A stylish, upper class hotel restaurant, used for a lot of big parties\n\nParadise Lounge – Sonny’s strip club\n\nPerks – A very small restaurant with a walk-up service window with all the seating outside. It serves Corinthos Coffee.\n\nPort Charles Grille – I haven’t actually seen it, but I think it’s upper class. Victor Cassadine picked it as a place to go.\n\nSavoy – Curtis’s restaurant with a back room Mrs. Wu used for gambling.\n\nGuiding Light\n\nIn 1987 Roxie Shayne says Sal’s is the best place in Springfield to get pizza.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nCrimson Lights – Nick and Sharon Newman bought their college hangout, coffee shop Crimson Lights in 1999. It cycled through several owners before Sharon bought it back.\n\nGeona City Athletic Club (GCAC) although we never knew it existed until Gina’s Restaurant burnt down, it’s now THE place in town to have a luncheon meal or a drink. They call it by its initial letters GCAC. It has a roof deck bar and pool on the roof. When the GCAC came back they added a jazz lounge dedicated to the late Neil Winters.\n\nGina’s – Gina’s was Gina Roma’s restaurant which was a nice quality restaurant. It also had a couple of rooms. She let Jack stay in one after his father threw him out of the house because he slept with Jill. Gina also sang there on a regular basis and sometimes other people did, too. Gina was Danny’s Romalotti’s sister, but she had shortened her last name. The place burned down after Kevin Fisher started a fire in an effort to kill Colleen Carleton who tried to protect her friend Lily Winters from his predatory actions. Kevin had locked Collen in the restaurant’s freezer and JT Hellstorm saved her.\n\nGlam Club – Noah’s restaurant opened in Fall 2022 and disappeared mid-2023.\n\nSociety opened in May 2019, owned by Devon Hamilton, managed by Abby Newman, and chef Lola Rosales.\n\nTop of the Tower – A high end restaurant on top of the tower of Newman Enterprises. There are three distinct areas: the bar, the dining room, and the landing by the elevator.\n\nUnderground – Nick’s nightclub where he had a booth dedicated and inscribed to his then wife, Sage. Noah worked with him there. It burnt down almost killing the current teen set at the time.\n\nLAST UPDATED August 12, 2024\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nSo I haven’t done one of these in awhile, but one of the things I did when the blog got started were random musical notes from soap operas. That’s because even in today’s best find out what song this is systems, it can be really hard to track down a certain song or what was a particular couple’s “song.” The majority of today’s post is from a Twitter thread someone got going on couple songs. Thanks to Twitter friends for helping with some of these. I went in and added who the people in the couple code are. If you have other songs you want to point out that appeared on soaps I’m always glad to get a list. There is also a very useful tweet I embedded from Buzzcast who is THE expert on soap opera music. I’m glad to get another one of these out. Watch for another update.\n\nI’m going to do a list of links for the previous posts. It’s probably easiest to hunt for a particular thing through the all blog search, but if you’re looking just browsing here’s where to find them:\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019 Part 1\n\n2019 Part 2\n\nLove on the Air (soap opera music album)\n\nSoap Opera Music on CD\n\nAll My Children\n\n“You And I” by Eddie Rabbitt & Crystal Gayle from Greg and Jenny’s wedding\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nScott Cliffton (Liam Spencer) sang a song several times after 2016 for Steam (Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer) montages. The Bold and the Beautiful – “The Song That Never Played” – Liam Montage in Monte Carlo 2016\n\nBold and the Beautiful – The Song That Never Played – Liam Montage in Monte Carlo 2016 – YouTube\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nBope’s (Bo Brady and Hope Williams) song is “Tonight I Celebrate My Love for You”\n\nJ&J (Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton) was called “All I Have” by Beth Nielsen Chapman. I also recall they played “Wicked Game” by Chris Isaak\n\nJarlena (John Black and Marlena Evans): “Unchained Melody” and “Rapture” and “If It Wasn’t for Your Love.”\n\nStayla (Steve “Patch” Johnson and Kayla Brady) is “Lady in Red” and “If Your Heart Comes Out Tonight.” “The Rose” to a lesser extent. Steve signed “The Rose” to Kayla when she was deaf, that was ICONIC. I listed “The Rose” last because they only played it the show once but yes, it was synonymous with them. Another Stayla song was “Hopeless Romantic.” That’s that one Justin sang at their wedding.\n\nShims (Shane Donovan and Kimberly Brady) was “Friends and Lovers.” “Friends & Lovers” was sung by Gloria Loring who played Liz Chandler on the show.\n\nCarrie Brady and Austin Reed had “Suddenly” by Olivia Newton John and Cliff Richard. Also “I Only Have Eyes For You” by the Flamingoes.\n\nLawrence Alamain and Katerina “Carly Manning” von Leuschner had “Fascination.”\n\nPhilip Kiriakis And Chloe Lane had “I Need You” by Leann Rimes.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nLuke Spencer and Holly Sutton had “Baby Come to Me” James Ingram and Patti Austin.\n\nRobert Scorpio and Holly Sutton had both “How Do You Keep the Music Playing” and “Greatest Love Affair.”\n\nGuiding Light\n\nBuzzcast says: Guiding Light and ATWT swapped music cues often. Then, Another World got ATWT‘s whole catalog in 1997 when it changed. Santa Barbara and ATWT also shared music cues.\n\nSome of Loving‘s musical cues were adopted by As the World Turns after Loving was canceled.\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nMartha Byrne wrote songs for ATWT including “Find My Way Back” as a tribute to Lily and Holden\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far.

following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKarter – Katie Logan and Carter Walton\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQuarter – Quinn Fuller and Carter Walton\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nSheacon – Shelia Carter and Deacon Sharpe\n\nSinn – Steffy Forrester and Dr. John “Finn” Finnegan\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThamber – Thomas Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nCaustin – Carrie Brady and Austin Reed\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJelle – EJ Dimera and Belle Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.

2023\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKarter – Katie Logan and Carter Walton\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQuarter – Quinn Fuller and Carter Walton\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThamber – Thomas Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJelle – EJ Dimera and Belle Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.

I thought it must have been quite impactful to be around in the moment when it happened. I talked with my mom and my cousin about watching the news after JFK was shot. My cousin was watching As the World Turns live in our living room when Nancy was interrupted and the assassination news came on. I had watch the videos, the tapes, I knew the country had come to a stop, but I hadn’t experienced it. (See Note)\n\nNow, I know what they felt like when I asked. The 9/11 attack was 20 years ago. There is an entire generation of people who weren’t gathered around their TVs watching the second Tower fall. Each year that passes means a smaller percentage of the population will remember it. It will become like Gettysburg, Pearl Harbor, and JFK’s assassination. An important point on a timeline, but only a dot, only photos, only stories. For them it won’t be a memory. The cold pit in your stomach won’t be a thing they felt and so I like to revisit it every year. To at least keep the photos and stories in memory.\n\nBut there really aren’t any more new soap related stories now. Soap operas played an important role in the beginning and then proceeded to back away as quickly as they could. I wish I could tell you more soap stories about it. Maybe that they continued to write Phillip on Days of Our Lives like they remembered he lost part of his leg after signing up and serving in that war. Or maybe that Stitch on The Young and the Restless who just made a short return and played some of his experience as a field medic. But I can’t. It has fallen out of the lives of our soap opera family even quicker than it dropped away in real life. I’ve already written all about how soap operas helped pull us through that terrible time.\n\nThis year I decided instead to point to a documentary I found out about through We Love Soaps. It’s about popular culture in general, but does talk about the role soap operas played. Watch it. Remember. And appreciate how important soap operas are to American life.\n\nNOTE: There is a political tone in this example. If you like or dislike John McCain you may not want to read any further, but that’s just the set up for my example, not my point. I once told a co-worker when we were talking about John McCain about the video he made when captured and how it was the most romantic thing ever. I still can’t get over that he went from the man in that video to dumping his wife for another woman – who then acted like she’d been his wife when all that happened. Anyway the set up wasn’t important. My co-worker very snarkily said, “I wasn’t old enough to see it.” First off, did he not know videos (no matter what the format) are a thing and how did he not see that video of he even had just briefly gone over the Vietnam War in a high school history class? It’s a pretty important video having been released by the Viet Cong showing they had not only captured another American citizen, but a politically important one. It’s used most times when documentaries or news reports talk about Vietnam POWs. McCain was offered to be traded, but he refused because the prisoners of war had established a first in/first out agreement among themselves and he honored it. That is to say I hadn’t seen the video on the evening news either, but later watching documentaries about the history of the Vietnam War. (Also, just how old did this co-worker think I was? I was born after Vietnam fell.) BUT my point is that I didn’t see it live. Watching it later, knowing what is going to happen after is a completely different thing. Also, that no matter how important something is, if it didn’t happen to them there are a lot of people will either forget it or never be taught about it. Or snark that they weren’t old enough to have seen it.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.
