        "text": "TSJ’s last day filming for the show was late July (the 22nd). The entire time I’ve been hoping that TPTB released the information to throw fans off track (much like the ‘Todd’s execution scenes when, I believe, TSJ’s contract was up and TPTB kept us guessing about whether or not he would return. At time moves on, I realize that it’s utterly hopeless to believe that TPTB are playing a waiting game and I realize that RH’s Todd has indeed won out. While I’d preferred having both men onscreen, it’s clear that RH’s Todd had to win out. Bummer, but I accept it will adjust.\n\nBummer? Yes, bummer. I’ve been adamant that I want TSJ to be declared the ‘real Todd’ while keeping RH’s Todd on as the newly discovered brother brainwashed into believing he was Todd Why? Although it took me a while to warm up to him, I’ve been a huge TSJ supporter since Todd’s “death row” storyline. It’s one of the most ethereal, hauntingly beautiful, storylines OLTL writers have offered. A rapist, who later became a rape survivor, is on death row after being convicted of killing his assailant. I think TSJ added an intangible quality to the role that RH’s Todd didn’t have.\n\nRather than build on the magnificence of that storyline and send Todd on a journey of introspection, OLTL writers took the opportunity to make Todd meaner, angrier, and more vile with each act -primarily to prop other characters and storylines. TSJ’s Todd was sacrificed to sell Cole and the Starr as a burgeoning supercouple and the writers wasted no time in taking TSJ’s Todd to a new low (battering Cole, knocking a pregnant Starr down a flight of stiars, threatening to kill orphaned adolescents, bullying Starr’s friends, etc).\n\nTodd had become such a heinous character that OLTL writers wasted months creating a new ‘high school musical’ around the “eternal” love of Starr and Cole, with Todd being cast as evil personified. Much of Langston’s play centered around the heartlessness of a man like Todd, who’d lost the ability to recognize and bask in the glow of true love. When an entire town’s collective life revolves around a high schol musical on the glory of teen love/pregnancy as a lesson about love for the ages? Your show and its characters are doomed. I think the show for far too long leveraged its credibility on the backs of its youngest performers (not their fault at all) in the hopes of bringing in newer/younger viewers — and as has always been true of daytime, younger viewers are as uninterested in hot mess storyline about their lives as the rest of us. It didn’t stop TSJ’s Todd from becoming a causalty and beginning the downward spiral toward irrelevance.\n\nLike RH before him, TSJ’s portrayal of the character became one of boredom and he began projecting ‘shorthand’ acting. His responses became quick quips. Facials expressions (plural) became facial expression (singular). The return of Marty Saybrooke was the death of TSJ’s Todd Manning. His struggle for redemption – post Marty’s rape (the first time) was gone. His sad realization that he would never be able to make up to Marty, or the community he offended and terrorized, for his actions was gone. His struggle to forgive himself for what he’d become, was gone.\n\nThe writers, I can only guess, felt that they’d found the one sure fire way of giving all of that back to fans. RH’s Todd gets a fresh start. If he becomes ‘Real Todd’, it means that the writers can take us back to the place where we loved the flawed Todd Manning because he would still be struggling with his humanity and his fighting his fear of returing to the sociopath he’d once been (the sociopath TSJ’s Todd was sacrificed to become once again).\n\nWatching Viki with Todd, even I began to long for old Todd. I remembered how instrumental a role Viki played in Todd’s redepmtion and how much closer to human she made him. The few minutes of Viki with the RHTodd’s (the Todd who was allowed to experience human emotions) made me “homesick” and sad that the writers had wasted the gifts that TST brought to the role at the same time. There is something special in RH’s Todd’s relationship with Viki that TSJ’s Todd was never allowed to capture. I felt like an intruder watching Viki watch her baby brother (RH Todd) sleep. The moment felt so real and I could only imagine that in fictional Viki’s shoes that I, too, would long for the brother with a familiar face, a familiar sound and familiar mannerisms.\n\nI get it, because as much as I’ve loved TSJ in the role and for as much as I hope there is a way to bring him back, afterall, I can see the emtional threads of this storyline braiding themselves together to give fans the Todd they’d hoped they would get with TSJ and were disappointed when the writers had other plans. EZ’s Viki and RH’s Todd have the opportunity to bring viewers back to what feels like ‘home’.\n\nInitially, this storyline led me to imagine the Emmy worthy work Erika Slezak would deliver as the emotional heart of the Lord family, torn between two brothers who want to be loved best by her – one who now had everything and one who’d pretty much lost it all. Both brothers would be fearful of being rejected in favor of the other. I thought of the stress and pain it would cause Viki to constantly be asked to choose between them, as it has caused her the same gutwrenching pain she experiences even still with her daughters. Ithought of the comic moments with the two sets of long lost Lord twins, RH-Todd and his favorite, Jess. TSJ -Todd becoming Natalies’s champion. In the end, while both Todds are familiar to Viki, both would be strangers. Now it’s becoming clearer that the writers are going to make a ‘choice’ themselves, and I’m resigned to the fact that their choice won’t be mine and TSJ won’t be back. More is the pity.\n\nUltimately, it must be hell to work for an ABC soap in a familiar role. From the return of the “Real Greenlee” to the return of RH’s Todd, any actor would probably be smart to consider themselves just a temporary long-term replacement in any ABC soap role.\n\nNo, not ‘Basterds’, that’s Tarantino’s deal. The IB’s I’m (lovingly) referring to are the daytime writers who have yet to give up on trying to pull one over on the fans!\n\nOne Life to Live\n\n1. I’d appreciate it if someone would explain to me why Cole and Starr (of ‘We’re Cole and Starr’ fame) would think it was ‘ok’ to involve Starr in Cole’s ‘21 Jump Street‘ drug operation. From there, “Stole” proved that neither will ever be a member of the Llanview brain trust! I was stupefied after they involved their innocent defenseless baby to give ‘credibility’ to Cole’s cover. Why didn’t they stage a break up before having Cole go ‘undercover’? Why not have Starr and child leave town for a while? Oh, I get it! “There is no ‘Starr and Cole, they’re fictional – THEY didn’t do it”! “It was all the writers doing”. That won’t stop me from cringing whenever Starr and Cole are on. The longer this pairing goes on, the weaker the writing for them becomes. It’s increasingly more difficult it is to like them and I find myself resenting the airtime they’ve stolen from veteran characters. The characters are consistently placed in storylines that are ‘too adult’ for them and the integrity of the storyline suffers as a result.\n\n2. I don’t care who Rex’s father is… it’s dragged on too long without enough plot points in between to keep me curious. Now I’m just annoyed every time the topic comes up. Rex is a freakin’ private investigator. He must really suck at his job if he can’t figure this one out. Isn’t it just a tad bit odd that he can figure out that Tea has some deep dark secrets, but can’t find his own father? It’s also odd that he can’t keep up with Stacy’s mustache twirling machinations!\n\nI love Stacy Morasco… oh yeah, I said LOVE, but it’s evident that while her engine is on, there’s no one behind the wheel. If SHE can outsmart Rex, time and again, he’s working with a single digit IQ. I’m going to hate myself later for admitting this, but I’m thrilled at the thought of a Gigi Schuyler pairing and a Rex and Stacy pairing – if only because Stacy will make sure Rex stays miserable for a LONG time. What irony that Ilene Kristen who played Ryan’s Hope’s scheming bad girl (Delia Reid Ryan) could become the onscreen mother-in-law of a similar character!\n\n3. Fish and Kyle. Daytime writers seem to believe that all gays have a traumatic coming out experience. While it may be a difficult moment for some, will OLTL writers ever give the audience a gay character who isn’t closeted and terrified of coming out? I lived through the Daniel Colson storyline. I would have much rather had Fish avoid Kyle because he gave his heart and soul to Kyle in college and Kyle cheated, lied, and was generally unconcerned about anyone but himself. That’s VERY consistent with the scheming, lying, blackmailing Kyle we were introduced to.\n\nAt some point, writers, can we please just have gay characters who are actually HAPPY with their lives, and not afraid that their friends and family will turn on them? Am I watching too much Miami Social? (Yeah, I should be ashamed of admitting that too! That cast of real life characters puts the ‘super’ in superficial!)\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\n1. Oh those sneaky GH writers! They’ve pulled a fast one. Every FBI agent, or undercover cop, ever sent to ‘take Sonny down’ ended up falling for Jason’s pecs, Spinelli’s wit, or the magic of Sonny’s pecker (Hannah, Reese). So how have the writers topped themselves? HA! It’s the fruit of Sonny’s loins (product of the pecker) who is now being sent to take him down! Marked improvement, writers, really… only not! It’s a given that Dante Falconeri won’t end up carrying Sonny’s child and wouldn’t want to even if he could, thank the soapgods. Unfortunately there’s no guarantee that Dante won’t go the way of every cop/agent before him and end up loving his papa, Sonny, so much that he turns on his profession to protect him.\n\nEven though I’m having a hard time buying Dante as Olivia and Sonny’s kid, I’ll suspend disbelief if Dante is allowed to put the mob storyline to bed, rather than climb into bed with the mob when all is revealed. (I can’t be the only one who thinks that Dominic Zamprogna’s Dante, looks more like Olivia’s older brother than her son! David Lago would have been a much better choice given the character’s supposed age, but since I’m enjoying DZ in the role, I can live with it). Let’s hope that the revelation that Sonny is his father will mean that Dante becomes more determined than ever to shut Sonny’s operation down. If Dante doesn’t actually signal the end of the reign of the mob boys, GH is doomed. The writers either have to send them to prison (won’t happen) or have them leave their lives of crime (can’t see this happening either), but things can’t go on as they are.\n\n2. Nik… calling Emily Rebecca a ‘whore’ and ‘slut’ and repeatedly making reference to how easily she ‘spreads her legs’… just lovely… As much as I despise Rebecca, I would have cheered her on for slapping ‘Prince Nikolas’ out of his shoes, thank you very much! If I recall, Nik was as ‘slutty’ as Rebecca. She wanted money, he wanted an Emily substitute and tried to give it up to her much sooner than she was willing to give herself to him.\n\nWhy do I feel the need to shower after watching GH?\n\nThe Bold and The Beautiful\n\nSpeaking of showers, did anyone watch KKL’s Brooke and HT’s Taylor mud wrestling scene? Obviously, I didn’t, but as I understand it, the actresses (their characters) took a ‘mud bath’ to cleanse their toxins and a fight broke out between the characters.\n\nWhat’s up next? The Brooke and Taylor accidentally fall into a vat of jello and begin fighting?\n\nA pillow fight breaks out and they ‘accidentally’ start ripping each other’s shirts open?\n\nTsk, tsk, tsk, The Bold and The Beautiful writers.\n\nLet’s rid ourselves of all of the bad editors! (if you don’t mind the turn of phrase).Most of what took place on OLTL this past week pleasantly surprised me. Even my well worn remote would like to take this moment to thank the writers for relief. It pretty much had the week off with One Life, since I don’t remember hitting FF once this week. The only big shocker for me this past week were several pretty lousy editing choices, one in particular. I’ll get to that in a moment.\n\nSoap-heaven help me, I still like John and Marty. The only thing that’s harder to take than a dark and brooding John McBain is John McBain in love. ‘Happy’ John and ‘Brooding’ John are pretty much one in the same. It’s just at times tough to watch a man who SHOULD be filled with joy behave like a man whose problems could all be solved with the help of a good laxative. Wardrobe, could you PLEASE at least put on a brightly colored shirt under his dark suit jacket and dark coat, to go along with his dark pants and dark shoes so that we know the difference between Brooding John and Joyous John? Thanks!\n\nJohn’s reaction to Marty as she flashed back on her the manipulated-rape sex with Todd was a reminder that there are soap writers who still realize that it’s so much easier for fans to root for good men – we get so few of them in daytime. Many of us still love men who are sensitive to the needs of others, rather than focus on themselves and their own pain. LOVED that moment when John reminded Marty that he was always willing to wait for her – she’s worth it. LOVED that the writers didn’t follow that scene up with John immediately running to someone else to flirt with or have sex with while Marty was working on her recovery.\n\nThe only thing that made the scene even remotely awkward was watching Blair seduce Todd at the same time Marty had difficulty being touched by John because of Todd’s assault of her. If the writers wanted to make some of us squeamish about Todd and Blair, job well done. Otherwise? Bad editing job on this one. It made Todd and Blair seem completely disconnected from the world around them, belligerently insular. They seemed to not care about how much damage had been done to others in their time apart.\n\nBlair, who was disgusted by Todd’s treatment of Marty, seems to have absolutely no qualms about his actions, now. She was disgusted enough before to want to keep his children from him. Now? She can’t keep her hands off of him.\n\nI would much rather have had long soulful talks between the two rather than strip scenes and “shame-filled” sex. The problem with the writing for the once magnificent Todd and Blair is that that the writers don’t seem invested in having them break the inch deep-mile wide pattern they’ve established as part of their courtship. OLTL writers have seem to always bank on the hard work of Kassie DePaiva and Trevor St. John in winning back fans to the ‘Todd and Blair corner to bring romance back to the show. I think they’ll have to reconsider, this time. Too much damage has been done and an instant reunion most likely won’t give them the bump they’re looking for. How instant is instant in their case? Todd/Blair reunions can be summarized by the following dialogue:\n\n“You hurt me” (Todd to Blair, Blair to Todd, it doesn’t matter).\n\n“I’m sorry” (Todd to Blair, Blair to Todd, it doesn’t matter)\n\n“Stay away from me” (Todd to Blair, Blair to Todd, it doesn’t matter)\n\n“You don’t mean that” (Todd to Blair, Blair to Todd, it doesn’t matter)\n\nThey have sex… AND SCENE!\n\nWhere is the discussion about what they want and why they want it? What about some insight into why they dragged Marty and John into their psychodrama? How about some part humorous/part dramatic couples counseling for them? What about real consideration about Tea’s feelings? It’s bad enough that Todd cheated on Tea after she put everything on the line for him, her life included, but he then lied and said that it meant nothing that he’d had sex with Blair. If it wasn’t a lie that having sex with Blair meant nothing to him? It makes his actions even worse. The writers rubbed salt in fans’ wounds by having Todd coldly state to Blair that he was leaving her to go after Tea ‘because she’s worth it’.\n\nHells bells, people, you know that despite Tea’s fault, I’m a fan of the goddess of grand bitchery but for TODD to state who is ‘worthy’ and who isn’t? Well that just burns my grits. I would have loved watching Blair get up off the chaise lounge and slap Todd back to his infancy (which would finally allow his external state match his internal state)! Marty, Tea, Blair, his sister Viki, and even his own daughter, Starr… just how many women in Llanview are going to end up emotionally scarred thanks to this guy? Taking Todd down the dark road for the sake of pimping “Starr and Cole” is a decision that still haunts this show. The writers haven’t been able to find their ‘Todd mojo’ and get anything right with this character since then.\n\nDespite the detour and bad editing, I enjoy Marty and John.\n\nWhat else was there to love?\n\n1. Greg turned out to not be a big a jerk as he originally seemed. I liked that he experienced pangs of guilt about running out on Destiny and realizing that he’d hurt her with his actions. I still don’t like the guy enough to have Rachel walk away from Shaun and fall into Dr. Dork’s waiting arms. I just like the idea of Shawn and Greg working out their differences for their sister’s sake.\n\nLovin’ the OLTL writers for giving us this little family. It’s so unconventional and I can’t wait to see where they go next. Don’t make me eat those words, writers.\n\n2. I uh… liked Destiny last week. If you’re shocked, imagine how I feel. I’m starting to see what the casting directors saw in this kid when they cast her. She’s growing in the role and learning to convey a vulnerability that’s refreshing in a teen character, given the rash of adult-themed storylines daytime writers have been pushing for young characters, lately. It will be interesting to see where the friendship between Destiny and Matthew goes.\n\n3. I uh… liked Starr last week. Still in shock here! The discussion between Starr, Cole, and Jessica was so rational and thoughtful, I have to classify it as the high point of my soap watching week! Alderson held her own in scenes with Buddy and Williamson. Scene chewing is not her thing so this emotionally low-key scene felt genuine and believable. I have to admit that the discussion between Jess and Cole sparked my interest most. Er, NO, I don’t want to see them as a couple. I’m giving kudos to the writers for creating such a layered scene. Both made the connection that they were both ‘in recovery’ and made poor choices because of an inordinate amount of pain, but that they both needed to take responsibility for their own actions. Both Jess and Cole realized that they had to forgive others as they needed to be forgiven. For a brief and shining moment, I felt that I could honestly tell my friends who don’t know that I watch soaps about the show … well done, writers, well done! It was good enough for prime time… 😉 Ouch?\n\n4. Wish I could give a crap about the Stacy storyline, but I don’t. I don’t even care who Rex’s father is any more… just.not.interested!\n\nWhile Starr moved one step closer to being a ‘real mom’, Gigi took a step back for me. (Wait, I’m getting to it… there’s something I like about this storyline, hang on)… It was odd to watch her encourage Shane’s hatred of Aunt Stacy no matter how much of a low life Stacy has been.\n\nI had to wonder if there wasn’t a unconscious attempt to warn fans about the perils of being a young mother – since it appears that they’re avoiding that ‘lesson’ of young parenthood with Starr and Cole. Gigi applauding Shane’s comic book character (skanky Stacy? Sleazy Stacy?) REEKED of an immature mother dragging her child into her baby’s daddy drama. A mature mother would have told Shane that his feelings of anger are appropriate, but that it’s also appropriate to feel sorry for Stacy for what she’s become and to hold out hope for her. The Gigi-Shane scenes skeeved me out a bit, I gotta’ admit.\n\nSO, here’s what I loved\n\nA – That the ‘secret’ is finally out in the open. I was tired of this storyline about a month before it began (damn you spoilers!)\n\nB – That there’s a possibility of a Schuyler-Gigi pairing – the actors have an amazing onscreen chemistry. Rex and Gigi have been terminally cute. Schuyler and Gigi have the potential to be hot!. Having Rex sleep with Stacy and lie about it after treating Gigi like such dirt for so long makes Rex and Gigi a dead pairing for me, for now. No matter how many things didn’t add up, Rex refused to believe the truth and painted the Scarlett ‘A’ on Gigi’s chest – clearly tempted to use her own blood to do so. Let Big Rex, and little Rex, sit on the sidelines and watch Gigi happy with someone else for a while.\n\n5 – I’ve never been much of a Bo and Nora fan… but they’re reeling me in. Poor Clint… Sorry guy, I think I want to see a Bo and Nora reunion. Clint and Nora seem to have been killing time for a while now. Send Clint home to Viki (sorry Charlie!)\n\nThis generation\n\nRules the nation\n\nWith version\n\nMusic happen to be the food of love\n\nSounds to really make you rub and scrub\n\nChorus:\n\nI say\n\nPass the Dutchie on the left hand side\n\nPass the Dutchie on the left hand side\n\nIt a gonna burn, give me music make me jump and prance\n\nIt a go done, give me the music make me rock in the dance\n\nIt was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon\n\n(How does it feel when you’ve got no food ?)\n\nYou could feel it ’cause it was the month of June\n\n(How does it feel when you’ve got no food ?)\n\nSo I left my gate and went out for a walk\n\n(How does it feel when you’ve got no food ?)\n\nAs I pass the dreadlocks’ camp I heard them say\n\n(How does it feel when you’ve got no food ?)\n\nPass the Dutchie on the left hand side\n\nPass the Dutchie on the left hand side\n\nMusical Youth\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nWhen it rains, it POURS! If you’ve been reading me long enough, you know that I’ve been whining about OLTL’s decision to kill off the fabulous Nash Brennan (played by the even MORE fabulous Forbes March). I’ll whine no more… I’ll just be spending more time watching As The World Turns since TPTB there have had the good graces to cast Forbes in a new role! YAY! He’ll play Luke and Noah’s college professor who happens to also be openly gay. As if it was my birthday, the soapgods of ATWT have also cast Lynn Herring (GH, ex-Lucy Coe) as Henry Coleman’s mother… DOUBLE YAY! If she’s anything like Henry before his transformation, or the rest of his family, someone will need to say a prayer for Vienna! There’s fresh hell headed her way and she’s never experienced anything like it.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nSami/EJ… can’t speak. Sickened.\n\nHate.This.Storyline. Hate Ejami…\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nI just saw the most incredible commercial for ABC soaps… it’s an ad for ‘2 Young Mothers’ AMC’s Amanda – a woman in her mid to late 20s, and OLTL’s Starr Manning (Roughly 16 – 17 years old). Both storylines are about mothers who were supposed to give their children up for adoption. Both mothers have changed their minds. They want to keep their babies.\n\nWhat happens in the upper suites over at ABC? Does anyone with more authority than deciding who to hire in the mail room get to see the ads for ABC daytime before they air? Given the fact that ABC had an astoundingly bad week, during the last ratings period:\n\nBad Week for ABC (originally posted at S.O.N.)\n\nRatings for the week of May 25-29, 2009\n\nTotal Viewers\n\n1.

Eh… I’ll admit, I have SOME interest in what will happen if she keeps her baby and nutty Dr. Dave decides that he should be allowed to raise at least ONE of his children from infancy. I just have ZERO interest in Starr and Cole (who are, as we’re told “STARR AND COLE” – as if that has meaning. When I see ‘Starr and Cole’, I see a ruined Todd Manning who was destroyed to pimp a crap teen summer romance). I don’t care to see Starr raising a baby. I don’t care to see Starr and Cole reunite. I don’t care to see them struggle with the difficulty of being teen parents. For goodness sake’s folks, if you’re going to go forward on this storyline, don’t flippin’ advertise it.\n\nGuiding Light\n\nI understand that Rafe has to adjust to life outside of prison, but YEOW! Rafe is not only having a hard time adjusting, he’s actually beginning to behave almost as if he’d rather return to prison. With so little time left for GL (Sept. 18 is the final ep), it’s hard to believe that the writers are looking at spending that much more time on Rafe’s return in order to create unnecessary drama for Otalia.\n\nI’m torn between: 1 – appreciating the grittiness of the prison release storyline, 2 – being annoyed that Rafe won’t get the typical ‘Spaulding’ treatment after creating a crime; in what world would Alan actually listen to Natalia when she tells him that she doesn’t want him helping Rafe? He doesn’t listen to Phillip or Beth! Why would her give a damn that Natalia wants him out of Rafe’s life!??!; 3 -feeling disturbed by the fact that the Rafe storyline is getting more attention than the Otalia love story. Wouldn’t it be better to have Otalia together, living as a family and working to save Rafe from himself and from Alan? So little time writers… GET A FREAKIN’ MOVE ON!\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nShhhhhhh… no one tell the GH writers. SOMEONE slipped up and the writers are starting to inadvertently focus on romance. Can you believe it? That Patrick is so understanding of Robin’s PPD and that he’s supporting her should warm my heart but it doesn’t. OK, it does, but not the way you think. It’s to be expected, right? You have your husband’s baby and he realizes the sacrifice you made for him, for yourself, for your family. I’m just grateful that the writers veered away from Liz and Patrick flirtation and realized that there are many people out there who love and support their spouses in their worst moments without turning to someone else.\n\nI love that Patrick is a good husband.\n\nDo you know what I love MOST about this reunion? It’s that Patrick doesn’t think that it’s his role to ‘forgive’ Robin. I love that he stands back and watches Robin undergo a this period of self-exploration. He watches as Robin finally realizes what everyone else has been telling her all along. She’s been so driven, and so obsessed with perfection that it fed her inability to bond with Emma when Emma needed her so desperately. Robin would rather have not tried, than to have tried with Emma and failed. I love that Patrick and Robin don’t feel the need to ‘shape’ the other into a better person. They’ve learned to love one another as they are.\n\nPatrick has accepted Robin as is and when she was ready to change, he was still there. She allowed him to be who he was, when he was a playboy on the loose. She realized that she couldn’t change him and accepted him as he was. She was still there, ready to be with him, when he decided to change of his own accord. She waited for him to become the man he needed to be.\n\nThen there’s Carly and Jax. They’re the Ken and Barbie version of Patrick and Robin. There’s been a little more arm-twisting and ‘molding/shaping’ with CarJax than there has been with Scrubs, but it’s all worked somehow. I love that Jax accepts about Carly what drives others crazy about her; she has a tendency to obsess on those she loves and cares for. They become the center of her focus. Jax realizes that she’ll fight as hard for their family as she has for anyone else. He finally gets that about her. Jax is such a patient, kind, and loving man that he and Patrick stand out as Princes among the daytime frogs! Robin and Carly are lucky women. Patrick and Jax are even luckier men.\n\nAdd Elizabeth’s fighting Luke for Lucky’s sake, and I’m in GH fan heaven! THREE good men, Three good women, THREE great relationships… and this is GH!?!??\n\nPass the Dutchie, baby!\n\nWhere does that phrase come from? Some of you may remember the UK youth group that sang the song. The origin of the title was always in question. Some believed it was a reference to what is the equivalent of a ‘bong party’ (which makes sense of its use for AMC/OLTL/GL… but later it was determined that the origins linked to the notion of a communal experience (passing a dish, eating together as a group/a family)… as in the case of ATWT/GL…\n\nThe Good: Thank you writers for finally wrapping up the ‘Baby Chloe- Hope’ storyline. It’s been a long time in coming and I was getting sick of it!\n\nThe Bad: (With sarcasm): Thank you writers for the ‘Baby Chloe -Hope’ storyline.\n\nThe WTF: (with incredulity and a tad bit of disgust): Thank you writers for the ‘Baby Chloe -Hope’ storyline. Of all of the storylines you COULD have told, this is what you saddle us with?\n\nThere are some legitimately wonderful reasons to love OLTL, in my book:\n\n1. It’s not All My Children. Need I say more?\n\n2. None of the characters are named Michael Corinthos Jr. How is it is that General Hospital writers have a knack for taking an event that should be considered a blessing and turn it into such an awful AWFUL thing? Little Michael Corinthos’ awakening was something I felt myself regretting about 10 minutes after the kid opened his eyes. To the credit of OLTL’s writers, they haven’t managed to make me wish that any of their teen characters would lapse into a coma! ALTHOUGH… I wouldn’t mind seeing LESS of all of them.\n\n3. Viki Lord. Period. What would this show do without Erika Slezak? I don’t even want to know!\n\n4. The triangle between Clint/Nora/Bo will be heating up soon into a quadrangle with mixed partners Clint/Nora/Bo/Lindsey. I’ve never been a big Bo/Nora fan – primarily because I’m not a Nora fan. I say that knowing that MANY OLTL fans are Bo/Nora fans and for their sake, I sure hope that the show’s writers honors its history and gives the couple back to the audience who loves them. The question is… what happens to Clint?\n\nClint/Lindsey? (Can you imagine their couples name? Clindsey? Lint? FUN!) Since it seems that CH’s Lindsey’s stay is temporary, I have doubt as to whether the writers would move in that direction. Too bad, Lindsey was fabulous with both Clint and Bo in the past. I would be interested in the chemistry between JVD’s Clint and CH’s Lindsey.\n\nClint, on his own? Angry? Scheming to break up Bo and Nora? Where’s the fun in that? I’d rather see Clint go back to London before having him take on his own brother over a woman he shouldn’t have been with in the first place. I had a preference for Clint and Nora over Bo and Nora, but to have Clint becoming involved with the love of his brother’s life was a bit much for most of you and in moments of objectivity, I agree.\n\nClint and Viki? If you’re going to make me suffer through Bo and Nora, writers, I’ll take Clint and Viki (no worries, anti-Clint/Viki fans… I never get the pairings I like). I think Clint and Viki/ Bo and Nora have the potential to take fans back to some of the glory days of OLTL. I have to admit that I’m concerned about the initial awkwardness of the two couples getting together in light of Nora and Clint’s relationship… eh,there’s been worse on this show.\n\n5. Believe it or not, I think that John and Marty (or the prospect of John and Marty) would be far more interesting than Blair and John – who’ve only managed to put me to sleep.\n\n6. Jessica and Brody. Even now, I’m still disappointed that Nash is gone and that Jared survives in his place, BUT, at least TPTB have come as close as they possibly could to Nash, without trying to replace him with a ‘Nash Clone’. Brody has ‘Nash like’ qualities (hot as sin, a beautiful body, thoughtful, kind, and loving), but have given him a unique personality and core.\n\nSo… setting aside that things I actually like, I have to say that the ‘Baby Chloe- Hope’ storyline has the potential to keep me tuning out OLTL (or at least FFing most of whatever episodes I bother recording.\n\nI think the teen pregnancy storyline was the biggest mistake the writers have made so far. I’m not against the idea of a teen pregnancy storyline. I’m simply against the teen pregnancy storyline for the chosen characters. Why?:\n\nI hate the back door approach to keeping Todd and Marty connected given their history. It’s bad enough that he’s violated her twice in a lifetime, but now they’re connected because their children are ‘in love’ and are now parents together. BULLOX!\n\nI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. This is NOT a storyline that plays to Kristen Alderson’s strengths. She has become the weak link in this storyline. I find KA’s emotional responses to be stilted and unbelievable.\n\nAdding the teen pregnancy storyline on top of the drug addiction storyline was a bit much. The writers have seemingly decided that the juiciest storylines should go to the youngest actors and that the veterans should be stuck with trivial, pointless, boring storylines. It’s another storyline for which Kristen Alderson seemed completely unprepared and didn’t connect as an actress, in my opinion. She uttered the dialogue well enough, but her performances felt like a ‘script reading’ rather than watching someone who was emotionally impacted by a loved one’s drug abuse.\n\nOddly enough, Brandon Buddy has done as well as any actor with significantly more experience. He’s been a marvel. The only problem with having handed him this storyline is that he seems far too mature an actor for the role he now plays. It’s time to SORAS Cole to 18 and find him a cougar (no older than 25, please, not someone too much older). “Starr and Cole” now feel like little Starr and her much older brother – ICK!!!!!!!!! By the way, Brandon should be nominated, next year, for the addiction storyline.\n\nKA fans I’m not completely ‘Anti-Starr’. I think there are a number of storylines that would be great for the character and would showcase the actress’ abilities well. The Baby Chloe-Hope storyline just isn’t one of them.\n\nWhile all of daytime has me rolling my eyes lately, OLTL – in particular wins the ‘shut your pie hole’ awards.\n\nJared wants to tell the truth because it’s the right thing to do? While I can appreciate the fact that even JARED sees the irony in his statement about what’s morally appropriate, it still galls me that he’s shown little concern for how the news of the real Chloe’s death will impact Jessica. Nat wants to protect Jess and now feels sorry for her? Both of you, SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE! This whole mess got started because Nat wanted to stick it Jess and Jared wanted to help her. I’m sickened at the thought that Jess will lose Chloe after losing Nash – both lost because of Jared and Natalie. IF ONLY there was some way to make that child hers. If not? It’s time to bring Tess back and let her finish what she started! It’s time for Jared and Natalie to go.\n\nAs if causing Jess even MORE grief wasn’t bad enough, what about the pain Jared and Natalie are causing ME!??! I’ve struggled hard to accept the new ‘grown up’ role for Starr Manning – I have. The problem is that it’s just not working for me. I don’t know how you feel, OLTL fans, but this new set of storylines does NOT play to Kristen Anderson’s strengths. I think the writers moved Starr into pseudo-adulthood too soon. The emotional scenes appear forced and far too artificial for me to connect to. Starr’s scenes with ‘Chloe’ make me cringe. The thought of more scenes of “Starr” and whining Marcee McBain locked in a custody battle over Hope (we’ve lost Hope, we need Hope, our Hope is gone – UGH) makes me want to set my television on fire. Damn you, Jared and Natalie, damn you!\n\nNora vowing to take down Cole? I’ve officially had my fill of Nora “the ethically flexible D.A.” The truth is that I was done with her years ago, during the fights with Lindsey and the affair with Sam when she passed ‘Sam’s child’ off as Bo’s. (Apparently no one knows how to perform in vitro in Llanview. They’re GREAT at trauma medicine since it’s the only thing docs in Llanview ever practice.) Had it been someone else’s child, Nora would have most likely been fighting to get Cole into drug and alcohol treatment, family counseling to reunite him with his mother, and had him doing community service by talking to high school kids about drug use. She’d have railed at the system for letting a villain like Todd go free while a young man who made a horrible mistake is being severely punished. She MIGHT have even quit her job in protest and defended Cole, herself, if the D.A.’s office chose to press charges.\n\nShe’s always been ‘flexible’ when it comes to helping her pals and granting them the grace and mercy of the courts. Intimidating a teenage boy and making him feel as if he should be buried UNDER the prison for his actions? Bite me. Does Cole deserve jail time? Sure. He chose to take drugs and get behind the wheel of a car disregarding the possible harm to others. Does he deserve Nora’s disdain? Sure! But just ONCE I’d like to see the self-righteous Nora Buchanan choose to exercise discretion and say nothing. Nora? SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE!\n\nBTW, SoapNet is linking to this appearance by Kristen Alderson and Brandon Buddy on the Tyra Banks show. The OLTL actors demonstrate different aspects of teen dating violence:\n\nRay Montez now faults Todd because Tea didn’t work fast enough to get him out of prison… REALLY? REALLY? Buddy, SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE! Is there some right of passage for Llanview residents that states that they MUST have conflict with Todd, of any sort regardless of how ridiculous it is, before the other Llanview citizens will play nice with them? Ray could have hired another attorney. He could be angry at Tea, alone. OR he could have realized that Tea wasn’t capable of moving any faster because his daughter didn’t know her well enough to open up to her. The idea that Ray now hates Todd inspires me… to YAWN. There’s far too much for this guy to do onscreen instead of going after Todd Manning over something so trivial.\n\nStacy Morasco, a potentially fabulous character and a throwback to what a TRUE bad girl should be… so I guess it makes sense that the writers made her a cartoon villain in record time. WHO takes a completely fabulous gift like Crystal Hunt, sees the awesome mess she’s able create onscreen through Stacy, and turns her into one of the most unlikable characters in daytime?\n\nStacy tells Gigi that she deserves to have Rex because she’s a million times hotter/way hotter? Juvenile, but HILARIOUS that it’s her meter for determing what ‘love’ is. God bless gorgeous Farah Fath for not slapping the writers when she read that script. If the writer who added that line isn’t on crack, I don’t know how else to explain that comment. With true ABC sensitivity to women, I thought the line might be followed up with “and I’m the REAL Gigi”. It was an awful thing to do to Fath.\n\nAs for Stacy, there’s no ‘love to hate’ left for a character who tells her grieving sister that she either has to give up the man she loves, the father of her child, or watch her child succumb to leukemia… SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE, Stacy, you whack job. What could have beeen ‘love to hate’ has just turned into utter disgust. What were the writers THINKING? If Crystal Hunt can pull the writers’ fat out of the fire after this blackmail plot, it will be a miracle. The whole scene was ugly from start to finish!\n\nRight about now, you’re probably asking when the era of the smart woman began in daytime. I don’t blame you. Daytime writers seem to have an aversion to consistently smart women!\n\nDOOL: Marlena doesn’t get it? Has John left her so damaged that ANY man who shows her some attention is a man she’s willing to spend time with, these days? Let it go, Marlena, let it go. I’d rather see her return to Roman than spend one more minute with Max’s father.\n\nOLTL: Blair. What IS it about women and John McBain? He does that thing, the thing that says, “I’ll sleep with you, but don’t count on me being around when you wake up…” Somehow, that translates into some bizarre desire to sing a ballad to the man. Blair, remember Evangeline? Sure you do… she’s the last woman who sang to John. He made her so miserable she had to run from him. You’re on borrowed time, kid. You might want to consider focusing more on your daughter’s pregnancy than John’s ego. Something good will come from Starr’s pregnancy. Nothing good will come from waiting for John to lighten up and give a damn about anything. The more morose man in daytime is the man every woman who’s crossed his past inexplicably falls in love with, and I just don’t get it.\n\nTina Lord was born a schemer. Who in the world believes that she would willing walk into a room with a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door (yeah, big HUGE freakin’ lock) and allow herself to be trapped inside? Poor David Vickers, the dog… he’s locked inside with Tina and unless that place is stocked with puppy pads, things are going to get ugly.\n\nBnB – Brooke Logan. WHY, writers, WHY? Why not just have Katie and Brooke battle it out about which of them betrayed Bridget most? Why didn’t Katie ask how Brooke could be so disgusted by the fact that she slept with Nick when Brooke did it too, after knowing that Bridget was in love with the man, still, and after having slept with Bridget’s first husband too!\n\nKatie could have gotten her zinger in and Brooke would have been able to offer her own comeback… Clearly, she is guilty of having slept with daughter’s first AND second husbands – having children with each. The problem is that given her past, her disgust with Katie, without explanation, just makes her look crazy.\n\nBrooke’s retort to Katie could have included a confession of her own past, and that she’s still trying to deal with the guilt of being with men she didn’t love and trading her daugther’s heart in, in the process. She could have told Katie that she’s disgusted with her actions because she’s been there, and when the dust settles, that one careless moment was never worth what it cost Bridget. She could have shared with Katie that she knows what pain she’s caused Bridget in the past, she’s atoned for it. Brooke promised Bridget that she would never hurt her again, never thinking she’d have to protect her daughter against her own sister.\n\nGive Brooke SOMETHING to say that makes it clear that she’s a woman who’s grown and learned from her past actions, not just treat her as a woman who could hate her own actions, when they’re committed by other people. That would make her the same sort of hypocrite she’s fought against all these years – most especially when she’s fought back agains Stephanie, Taylor, and even dear departed Macy.\n\nGuiding Light – Harley. <sigh> Do the writers hate the viewers that much? Maybe, in some wild backstage fantasy, the writers are thinking that they can stick it to Beth Ehlers one last time by destroying what’s left of the character she originated, who knows? In what universe would Harley leave her family, uproot her youngest children, and abandon her oldest child, one she gave up once before? It was bad enough when she ran off with her daughter’s boyfriend to protect him from being prosecuted of a crime he actually committed. Now she’s leaving her vulnerable (and incredibly stupid) daughter in the hands of a unrepentant criminal who’d already lead Daisy down the primrose path before, involving her in drug use and being an unwitting accomplice in her own cousin’s death. IF the writers think they’re sticking it to BE, newsflash, you’re sticking it to the fans even more. We’re the ones still left to tune out the show. Please keep that in mind.\n\nWhat’s next? We’ll find out that Gus had six wives in addition to Natalia?\n\nPhillip Spaulding is a pimp?\n\nVanessa Lewis sews fur coats from puppy fur?\n\nC’mon writers. Trying to kill off the last loving menory of one of GL’s strongest women in the history of the show is petty, and beneath the dignity of this show. We deserve better. Your time would be better spent trying to figure out how many times Reva’s undergone menopause and how it’s possible for her to be pregnant, again.\n\nYou can’t come back from this one, unlike the weak and laughable recovery of YnR writers who’d forgotten that Victor had a vasectomy when they wrote the pregnancy storyline for his child bride. No ‘secret reversal’ explanation will help you this time. Her meds kicking her period on for a month, after menopause? That’s your explanation? After the hefty drugs, radiation, and every other treatment Reva received prior to and after her near death? Wow.\n\nIs it any wonder that so many GL fans have begun a campaign to save the show? CLICK HERE to find threads linked to the ‘Cry for Change’ campaign, among others.\n\nBold and Beautiful. Who’s the bigger loser in the deal, Marcus or Donna? My money is on Marcus. WOOHOO, you find your biological mother and she’s a former model, rich as creases, and now in charge of a multimillion dollar conglomerate. What’s not to love? Oh, just the fact that she’s nutty as a fruitcake (see Forrester Creations ‘takeover attempt’). Not enough? Add that she’s dumb as a stone! How is it that young Marcus knows enough to be suspicious of Owen and Donna is falling for his act hook, line, and sinker?\n\nIf Donna loved her ‘honeybear’ as much as she claims, or her son for that matter, Owen would have been out the door.\n\nAll My Children – JR and Adam. Adam is on the losing side, in this case. Just how many times can JR turn his back on his father and try to make Adam ‘pay’ for (insert incident)? His attempts to take over Adam’s company and/or fortune are becoming as commonplace as his change in hairstyles.\n\nHe can forgive Babe for every mean and nasty thing she’s done to him, including having one night stands just weeks after they were married, and running off with his child AND his brother, but Adam is the devil incarnate? What AMC needs is MORE Adam, and even an Adam clone or two (hint there, JR). Given what’s transpired on this show the past couple of years, Adam is the least threatening person in Pine Valley… so far…but give him time.\n\nOne LIfe To Live – Starr and Todd. It’s a draw! The mini-me Starr has become is absolutely intolerable to me. She’s demanding, obnoxious and completely out of control. I hate it women, in general, are blamed for their children’s behavior, but I think it works in Starr’s specific case. Blair shares some of the blame. Carrying Todd Manning’s genes set Starr up for a very difficult life, to begin with – but there was a least some chance of escaping her destiny to make life miserable for as many people as possible. Blair hasn’t done Starr any favors by having little-to-no guidelines for developing a sense of self control.\n\nWhile Todd moves to one extreme, appointing himself Starr’s Lord and Master, Blair moves too far in the other extreme – wanting to be Starr’s best friend. Hey, Blair, Starr has enough ‘friends’ – they helped get her in the situation she’s in now. She could use a parent. She’s sorely lacking one. While Starr is working hard trying to place her child for adoption, she should be looking for a placement of her own. Make sure to take Jack and Sam with you, kid!\n\nAs The World Turns – Puberty (Parker and Liberty). Isn’t it grand that their parents have FINALLY figured out that these kids need supervision, AFTER they were caught in bed together? Before that? The only parent who made time for either of them, and tried to keep them in line was Liberty’s father, Brad. Brad is a lone salmon swimming upstream, when it comes to parenting. He actually focuses on his daughter more than his own sex life. Imagine that!\n\nOh that Carly and Holden, and Jack and Janet. Theirs are the ‘F’ bombs that just keep giving and taking. They get their freak on and their 16 year olds get their freak on in response! Ain’t that grand? Summer love never seemed so backwards. Well, we know the outcome for OLTL’s Starr and Cole – a child she wants to give up for adoption, one he wants to keep and raise. The problem is that the OLTL storyline is weak, and without much merit as an example of the difficulty of teen pregnancy ( read more in the blog below “Jumping the Shark”). All of the issues that make the OLTL storyline a weak one are issues that make a strong case for a teen pregnancy storyline for ATWT’s lusting cousins, ‘Puberty’.\n\nBoth kids are from families that are hardworking, middle class (lower middle, or upper lower for Liberty and her mother, Janet). Raising a child WOULD be a struggle for Puberty, neither of which has a trust fund, slew of servants, or enormous mansions to raise their child in. Both are teens who rushed into sex, even while using birth control that neither probably knew how to use adequately or responsibly enough to be protected.\n\nThere was no emotional commitment between Parker and Liberty prior to having sex. Would they want to raise a child together? This pair would give a more realistic look at the emotional angst of having made a decision they weren’t ready for and the angst of dealing with loivng a child enough to give it a great home with parents who were ready to love and care for it. I’d hate for a Puberty pregnancy storyline (if there was one) to become as sensationalized as Gwen’s pregnancy storyline. I’d love to see daytime portray teen pregnancy realistically and with great deference to the hardships of real life teen parents. Since this is daytime, and almost no storyline is offered without controversy, let me offer the following:\n\nParker could turn to cousin Luke to help him. He’s not ready to be a father, and yet he’s not ready to see his child placed with strangers. At LEAST two options are now available.\n\n1 – Luke decides to adopt his cousin’s child. He talks it over with Noah, and Noah agrees to give him whatever help he can. It leads to them spending more time together and getting even closer – even if they’re not ready to be a full-fledged family. Can they survive Luke becoming a single father and splitting his time between their relationship and his son?\n\n2 – Luke and Noah decide that they’re ready for a long term commitment and raise the child together, as a family. They agree to adopt the Puberty baby together. This storyline, by the way, pulls Luke and Noah out of the ‘late teen’ trap the writers have been keeping them in to avoid their emotional and physical connection – which now makes even less sense given the explicit and graphic Puberty romp.\n\nIn either case, Luke/or Luke and Noah adopt the child, agree to help raise him, and end up fighting Janet and Brad on the adoption. Janet opposes for religious reasons. Brad opposes because he wants custody of the child and plans to raise it with Katie. Both Liberty and Janet thinks it’s too much to have the child raised as Liberty’s sibling and fight Brad.\n\nWhat’s that, you ask? Haven’t NUKE been through enough? I get the point, and understand why it would be hard to watch another ‘anti’ storyline when it comes to these two, but I think a storyline about adoption could be a great way to address the issue of whether cultural ideas about adoption involving GLBT parents is more myth than reality. This would be an opportunity for the writers to debunk myths and to open the discussion about the more than a half million children in this country who need homes, and are barred from living in the context of a family with same sex parents because of unfounded fears.\n\nI think the writers have exhausted the focus on Luke and Noah as ‘good guys’ with hearts of gold. I think they’ve done enough to show us the stereotypes about gay males are just stereotypes. It’s time to move them into family mode. It’s time to fully integrate these characters and give them a meaty storyline that isn’t just about ‘coming out’ and dealing with ‘being out’. They’re out. It’s time for them to become as real as any other character on canvas.\n\nUpdate: I’ve just been informed that Noah is roughly 20, Luke 19. It wouldn’t make much of a difference to have Nuke become parents at such a young age instead of Puberty. Too bad the writers haven’t SORASed them as they have so many others. Nuke, mid 20s? They’d make great parents. It’s just a few short years away.\n\nWhat’s that, you say? Robin has been home for years now? No, dear readers, only Robin’s body has been showing up on screen every day. The REAL Robin Scorprio is finally back home and she’s now part of ABC’s bid to become the Anti-SoapFather network. OLTL’s Starr Manning has told her ‘baby’s daddy’ that he’s treating her fetus as if it’s HIS family. Now GH’s Robin is actively fighting to take away Patrick’s right to see his child because he was unsure of being a father in the first place, something he told her he wasn’t ready for, long before she became pregnant.\n\nThe Robin who’s given Patrick hell over seeing his child? THAT’S the real Robin, as far as I’m concerned. Is Robin treating Patrick’s fears about becoming a father as a personal rejection? Most likely. It’s in Robin’s history, and her nature, to do so. Robin has a sordid history when it comes to infants and their fathers.\n\nSome of you may recall that Robin revealed the truth about Michael Corinthos’ paternity when he was just an infant. Why? According to Robin, it’s because she felt that AJ had the right to know that HE, not his brother Jason, was Michael’s biological father. That would have made sense and not seemed so self-deluding if the scenes just before Robin’s ‘attack of conscience’ weren’t of her and Carly arguing about who should raise Michael. Robin felt that she and Jason were best suited to care for him, since they were a couple and weren’t as ammoral as Carly – yes, despite Jason’s role as a mob hitman.\n\nCarly, being Carly, scoffed at the idea and taunted Robin by telling her that Jason would also be bonded to the two of them (Carly and Michael) and that there was nothing she could do about it. Carly was wrong, Robin’s next move was to call Aj. She effectively made sure that Jason could not and would not be Michael’s father. If she couldn’t have Jason and Michael to herself, there would be no need for Jason to raise that child.\n\nThat was the day I began to despise Robin and didn’t care if she ever graced the screen again, until Patrick! For me, Robin hadn’t redeemed herself, Patrick made her tolerable. That poor, dumb, hot-as-hell, bastard! If only he’d known about Robin’s past – or at least known the full story. I know that many GH fans have fond memories of Robin as a child, but she lost her ‘cute quotient’ for me shortly after she began dating Jason. The shrill, self-righteous, moralizing woman some of you see now, as she attempts to cut Patrick out of his child’s life, is the Robin I’ve been annoyed by for years to come.\n\nBelieve it or not, I’m glad the issue was resolved without a court ruling, and that Patrick and Robin found their way back to one another. I like Patrick, and not just because he has abs you can eat off of, but because he’s honest -even if you don’t like hearing what he has to say. What a rarity for daytime males. I also like Patrick because he’s not afraid of saying to Robin what others have been either too afraid to say or too reverent and all-worshipping to say to her – she’s a pain in the ass who sits in judgment of others far too often! I like Patrick because as much as I don’t want to, he gives me a reason to want to like Robin again. Well done, Patrick, well done."
