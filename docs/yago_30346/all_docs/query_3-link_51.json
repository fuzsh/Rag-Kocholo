        "text": "By Allison Borgelt\n\nSoap-opera star Kassie DePaiva didn't think she was right for the role of Blair Cramer on \"One Life to Live,\" but those who watched her audition in 1993 thought otherwise.\n\n\"When I did get the part I was thrilled, but also a little bit shocked because I didn't think that I looked the part,\" said DePaiva, a native of Union County, Ky. The woman who held the role before her, Mia Korf, is Asian-American.\n\nEighteen years later, DePaiva still holds the part, but that will change in January when the show's final episode is broadcast. ABC announced the show's cancellation, along with the cancellation of \"All My Children,\" in April.\n\n\"It's a bittersweet goodbye,\" DePaiva said. \"I've been so happy playing the role of Blair and it makes me sad that it's ending, but I'm so happy to have been blessed with the part.\"\n\nDePaiva learned of the show's cancellation during a lunchtime rehearsal, when she was called to the studio floor of \"The View,\" she said.\n\nBrian Frons, president of daytime programming for the Disney/ABC Television Group, announced the cancellation in a satellite conference between Los Angeles and New York, DePaiva said.\n\n\"I was very shocked because we had heard rumors, but it was more rumors of 'All My Children' being canceled,\" she said. \"I had a mixed bag of emotions because, you know, it was my job, it was my friends that I've worked with.\"\n\n\"One Life to Live\" impacted DePaiva's life in several large ways. She met her husband, James DePaiva, on the show and her pregnancy was written into it, she said.\n\n\"It's afforded me a beautiful lifestyle,\" she said. \"I have met unbelievable friends working there ... (and) I've had an abundant amount of acting material to do, more than most people get to do in a lifetime, and it's been a wonderful, wonderful ride for me.\"\n\nDePaiva is allowing herself \"to go through the process of grieving the loss of the show,\" but is \"also excited about the next chapter,\" she said.\n\n\"This has been an unbelievable experience for me, but it won't be the last thing on my resume, that's for sure,\" DePaiva said. \"I'll continue to audition and then we'll just see where I land; I don't know.\"\n\nWhen the show is over, DePaiva said she will have more time to continue volunteering for the Center for Hearing and Communication. Her son JQ DePaiva is deaf, and she works to bring awareness to people with hearing loss and cochlear implants.\n\nDePaiva said she will also have more time to spend with her parents, Quentin and Hildegarde Wesley, in Morganfield, Ky.\n\nDePaiva's family moved to Morganfield from nearby Sturgis when DePaiva was in fourth grade, her parents said.\n\nThe people of Morganfield have a saying that \"parents are only as happy as their saddest child,\" Quentin said, \"so we have celebrated Kassie's ups and downs over the years. ... She's the same little old girl she was when she left home.\"\n\nDePaiva and her three siblings used to perform in 4-H and Farm Bureau talent shows, DePaiva said. She also sang at church and school and studied dance in Kentucky.\n\n\"I think the best thing that happened to me growing up in Union County was there was a high school drama coach named Judy Woodring who really made a beautiful foundation for me to really get my feet wet with acting,\" DePaiva said.\n\nIn addition to acting on \"One Life to Live,\" DePaiva appeared on \"Guiding Light\" from 1986 to 1991 and was a guest star on episodes of \"Baywatch,\" \"Timetrax\" and \"Melrose Place,\" according to her biography at abc.go.com. She also played a role in the movie \"Evil Dead II.\"\n\nDePaiva also has a singing career. She made three CDs and in 2009 became a member of \"The Divas,\" a musical trio with Kathy Brier from \"One Life to Live\" and Bobbie Eakes from \"All My Children.\"\n\nHildegarde said she has seen most of her daughter's shows and has \"boxes and boxes\" of videotapes of them.\n\n\"The fans are really devoted and nice people,\" Hildegarde said. \"They're going to miss these shows, I tell you.\"\n\nBut Hildegarde has hope for her daughter.\n\n\"When a door closes, a window opens, or something like that,\" she said."
