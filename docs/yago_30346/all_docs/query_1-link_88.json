        "text": "Recognize Darlene Vogel (Melanie) from a certain house? Darlene played Danny TannerÂ’s sister on Full House.\n\nErika Slezak (Viki) was one of the youngest students ever accepted to the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London at age 17.\n\nDespite her immaculate appearance, Linda Dano (Rae) just loves to get down and dig in the dirt - of her garden that is.\n\nKamar de los Reyes (Antonio) comes from a musical family. His brothers Daniel and Walfredo Jr., as well as his father Walfredo Sr (a famed percussionist), appeared on OLTL in 1997. Also a percussionist, Daniel has worked with such artists as Don Henley, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Nicks, Chris Isaak, Sheryl Crow, and former soap star Ricky Martin (ex-Miguel GH). You may have caught Kamar in a Spanish-themed Toni Braxton music video recently.\n\nAdmirers of the dress that Viki (Erika Slezak) wore to her wedding to Ben will be in awe to hear that all of its embroidery was custom done.\n\nLisa Peluso (Gina) shares her July 29th birthday with someone very close to her heart - her daughter Phoebe Ann."
