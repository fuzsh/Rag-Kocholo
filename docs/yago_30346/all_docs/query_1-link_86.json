        "text": "For more than 25 years, Debbie Gibson has proven she's an entertainer of immeasurable talent. From singer, songwriter and musician to actress and dancer, she embodies what it truly means to be an entertainer.\n\nGibson exploded on the pop music scene at the tender age of 16. A music prodigy, she quickly became the youngest person ever to write, produce and perform a number one single, (\"FoolishBeat\"), a record she still holds today in the Guinness Book of World Records. To date, Gibson has sold more than 16 million albums worldwide.After conquering the pop world, she set her sights on the theater. Gibson took a star turn in the Broadway production of “Les Miserables” as Eponine. She broke box office records in the London West End production of “Grease” as Sandy, and then took the stage in the U.S. Broadway tours of “Grease” and “Funny Girl” playing Rizzo and Fanny Brice. Gibson also wowed critics as Belle in Disney's “Beauty and the Beast,” Gypsy Rose Lee in “Gypsy,” The Narrator in the national tour of “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” Cinderella in the national production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's “Cinderella” with Eartha Kitt, Velma Kelly in “Chicago,” and SallyBowles in the Broadway revival of “Cabaret.”\n\nContinuing to dazzle with entertainment magic, Gibson bridged the gap between pop music and Broadway with her one-woman show \"Pop Goes Broadway.\" Critics agreed it was \"the best show Atlantic City has seen in quite some time...it's totally entertaining,\" during her three-week engagement in May 2008 at The Concert Venue at Harrah's. Phil Roura of the New York Daily News said, \"she has mastered her craft to the point where she just doesn't perform a song â she embraces it and delivers it with her own special stamp of approval.\"\n\nTo fill her passion of mentoring and fostering young performers and songwriters, she created \"Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth,\" a series of performing arts camps and music boot camps. In addition, she formed the “Gibson Girl Foundation,” a non-profit organization that awards scholarships and musical educational opportunities to underprivileged children who display talent and have a desire to participate in performing arts programs.\n\nIn 2010, Gibson made her debut in the world of orchestration. She collaborated on both the score and the powerful closing credits song, \"Rise,\" for Dr. Rutledge's documentary, \"3 Billion and Counting,\" about Malaria prevention in third world countries. Gibson guest starred in \"Cirque Dreams Jungle Fantasy\" at MGM/Foxwoods. The “Original Pop Princess” also released a new album, “Ms. Vocalist,” from Sony Japan that was top 10 on the Billboard charts and the first single, \"I Love You,\" hit No. 1.\n\nAs the new spokesperson for Children International, she spent time in early 2011 in impoverished villages in Manila. For more than 20 years, she has been a child sponsor and advocate. Gibson also starred with Tiffany in the SyFy hit “Mega Python Vs. Gatoroid.” Recently, she appeared inKaty Perry's hit music video for \"Last Friday Night (TGIF)\" and took a “Journey Through The 80’s” on a sold out tour with Tiffany. Currently, Gibson’s recording a new U.S. album. The first single “Rise,” which was shortlisted for an Academy Award nomination, is now available on iTunes. This year, she has a cameo in the film \"Rock of Ages\" and competes in “The Celebrity Apprentice.”\n\nFrom number one hits and platinum albums to starring roles on Broadway, film and TV, Gibson is a true entertainer with talent and charisma. For more information, visit www.deborah-gibson.com.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of music you make. You've got to have soul. That's what everybody really wants whether they consciously know it or not. It's that indescribable spirit that lights up a record and brings it to life. It's that unnamable feeling that listeners crave for decades. It's exactly what beats at the heart of Jay Sean's anxiously awaited fourth full-length studio album and second for Cash Money RecordsâNEON.\n\n\"This album is all about my soulful side,\" affirms the multi-platinum, international pop and R&B innovator. \"NEON was about bringing the diverse range of my artistry to the forefront. I really went for it in every way possible. This was my opportunity to give the world something beautiful\"\n\nRather than rush to follow a trend, Jay took his time and focused on what came naturally. After the massive success of Jay Sean’s hit single in America, he spent the past few years further developing his craft as a songwriter and performer. In other words, he evolved in every aspect. As a result, NEON began to really light up in early 2013.\n\nWhile in a writing session with his core production team OFM, as well as The Fairground, a signing to his entertainment brand Kamouflage Entertainment, the team struck creative gold. During one evening, album tracks \"Where You Are,\"Â \"Neon,\" and the single \"Mars\"featuring Rick Ross were born.\n\n\"We all agreed to put the words 'hit' and 'smash' out of our minds and make music that felt good,\" he recalls. \"We just had fun making music we wanted to listen to. Once we started thinking like that, this record came to fruition.\"\n\n\"Mars\" encapsulates that daring spirit. The track lifts off with a wild and wonderful beat, evoking a sexy and spacey bliss. Jay sings his ethereal verses in an impressive falsetto as Ross drops a smoking verse in the middle of this seductive haze. As far as R&B goes, it's on another planet altogether.\n\nThe artist goes on, \"I don't want to conform. I want to be on the forefront of change. The goal was to switch it up with 'Mars'. The song itself is about being intoxicated by something you can't describe. You could be with a chick and you don't understand why you're tripping that way. It's something intangible and beautiful. Rick did a sick verse. I've always loved his music, and I wanted him on there. [Cash Money C.E.O] Baby and Rick are like brothers, so he made it happen. Together, we made something next level.\"\n\nThat goes for the rest of the album as well. He enlisted the likes of OFM [Kevin Rudolf, Fabolous], Supa Dups [Bruno Mars, Drake], and Brian Kennedy [Chris Brown, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna] for production to round out the sound. Meanwhile, Ace Hood unleashes a scorching passage on the club banger \"All On Your Body,\" while Busta Rhymes wilds out with Jay on \"Break of Dawn.\"\n\n\"I remember when Busta was with Leaders of the New School, and I grew up on that era of hip-hop,\" he smiles. \"I used to watch him on Yo! MTV Raps, and now he's my friend and label buddy. He did his thing and killed the track.\"\n\nHowever, in many ways the ethos of the record is encapsulated in the title track “Neon”. Taking flight with stadium-size bombast, it's a massive anthem with a deeper message.\n\nJay admits, \"That one is based on my relationship with music. It's the ups and downs, the struggles and fights, and love. I can't let go of it no matter what. It's a part of me that will never go away. It's my purpose in life.\"\n\nHis passion continues to burn brightly. To date, he's sold over 12 million-plus singles and released five consecutive Top 40 Billboard singles \"Down,\" \"Do You Remember,\" \"I Made It (Cash Money Heroes),\" \"2012,\" and \"Hit the Lights.\" \"Down\" became the best-selling single by a British or European male artist in North America since Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind\". Over the past few years, he also touched down for captivating performances everywhere from Sri Lanka, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi to India, England, and Lebanon. Born in London and splitting his time between Los Angeles and New York, he remains an international superstar with a global mentality.\n\nHe also continues to give back. In 2012, he became involved with the nationally recognized ConAgra Foods' third annual Child Hunger Ends Here campaign. Along with other platinum stalwarts, Jewel and Owl City, he recorded an original version of the track \"Here's Hope,\" which was written for the initiative and interpreted in different ways by each artist.\n\nAs a writer, he also took on other challenges penning \"Superstar\" for famed Nickelodeon pop sensation Big Time Rush, \"Boom Boom\" for Australian X-Factor winner Justice Crew, \"Moment to Love\" for Australian Idol winner Tinomatic, and \"That's My Girl\" for UK X-Factor winner JLS. He also co-founded Kamouflage Entertainment whose early signings include Australian crew The Janoskians and UK songwriters, The Fairground.\n\nUltimately, NEON is unabashedly and unapologetically Jay Sean. \"Integrity was always in my mind and heart, while I was making this album,\" he concludes. \"I want everyone to know I listened and gave them what they were asking for. I didn't make this music for chart positions. I made it for myself and my fans.\"\n\nRegina Belle is a virtuous woman and she has lived her life and career with an integrity that has always been apparent in her music. After the chart-topping success of the traditional, foot-stomping record “God is Good” from her gospel debut, Love Forever Shines, Belle is prepared to take her integrity to another level with her newest gospel opus HIGHER (Pendulum Records/Walker Davis Entertainment).\n\n“What happened with ‘God Is Good’ on the first project was just surreal. I knew that I wasn’t going to have to start to the bottom because I do have a name and a very blessed career, but I had no idea that the church would be as receptive to my music as they were. I guess they felt safe because my (R&B) music has always maintained the decency factor and there was always integrity in everything I sang about in my songs.” The intention of her debut into gospel music was important, since Belle was raised in church singing gospel from the age of 8. “ I was purposeful in making sure that the music fans and people who were seeking God, that might not have been churchgoers, were able to see that God was using the same personâRegina Belle.”\n\nThe four-time GrammyÂ® Award and AcademyÂ® Award winner vocalist, whose hits have included such stellar offerings as “Make It Like It Was,” “If I Could,” “Dream In Color” and “A Whole New World (with Peabo Bryson) is prepared to offer the world a closer look into her heart and her walk with God with HIGHER.\n\nAs First Lady of New Shield of Faith Ministries in Atlanta, where her husband, John S. Battle III, is senior pastor, Regina Belle knew that the world was watching her transition, but more important to her was her own walk. “As I continue to flourish and expand in my journey as a woman and a wife, I felt God calling even higher, calling our relationship higher. There are some places that Regina Belle can go that others, even ‘church folks’ can’t go. God said ‘I can trust you’ and so here we go!”\n\nThe new project, which features duets with Lowell Pye (Men of Standard), powerhouse vocalist Kathy Taylor and the one and only Pastor Shirley Caesar, is a powerful offering of the best of Regina Belle, both personally and vocally. Recorded in Houston, TX, under the watchful direction of Chris Walker (“my spiritual brother and sounding board”), HIGHER is a collection of stunning ballads and it takes a few musical turns that will both surprise and please Belle’s loyal and faithful fans.\n\nThe lead singleâ“Make An Example Out Of Me”âis a pure and powerful testimony from Belle, who suffered from an illness recently that caused her to have two different surgeries and kept her from traveling for almost a year. “After I had gone through the surgery, I didn’t know that God was using me as an example. But what I did know was that my illness didn’t define my relationship with God but my response definitely would.” She knew it was time to go higher and “Make An Example Out Of Me” was Belle’s forceful declaration as she prepared to get up.\n\nAnother powerful song on HIGHER is “Mighty In Battle,” which Regina co-wrote. “This song reminds me of a war cry. It’s almost like an anthem. The cry of ‘Right now now now now now!’ kept speaking to me. When Chris (Walker) heard the playback of what we had put down in the studio, he broke it open and put that thing back together and it’s anointed. Lowell Pye gave the song exactly what it needed!” The track is strong and solid, but with a very percussive groove that’s sure to set the church and the charts on fire.\n\nSongs like “Coming Back” and “God Must Have Been With You” are standout tracks that are perfect for the soaring alto that has made Regina Belle a crowd favorite and anointed vessel since her 1987 debut on Columbia Records. “Coming Back,” a sweeping ballad of reclamation and restoration, is vintage Regina Belle, offering her pure vocals over a beautiful melody. “God Must Have Been With You” is also in the vein of the style of the beautiful song stylist. “These songs are more of who I amâ¦lyrically in the gospel realm, but musically in line with what God has always done with me.”\n\nBeing able to finally record with her musical mentor (and “spiritual mother”) Pastor Shirley Caesar is a dream for Belle, one that should have been fulfilled on her last offering, except that Regina was too nervous to reach out to the anointed storyteller. “When I saw (Pastor) Shirley, she asked me why I never called. I wasn’t going to miss that opportunity twice.” The phone call gave birth to “Been So Good To Me,” which is a combination of a traditional quarter-style song, with hints of jazz, bringing together the best of both singers for a powerhouse selection. Belle was initially a bit nervous with the style of the song, because “I didn’t want to get out of my lane, but I felt that thing. The song has jazz influences in it and a little more of me and we married the two.” Belle and Caesar, who have played mother and daughter in a Vy Higginson production of “Mama, I Want To Sing,” recorded Caesar’s part in North Carolina in a few takes in Caesar’s fiery vocal style that shows why the veteran is still the Queen of Gospel music. “When she asked me if I was singing my part, I said ‘No, Ma’m. I respectfully decline.’ After she sang that song, I wasn’t about to come behind her in the studio.”\n\nBelle felt equally as excited about pairing with gospel trailblazer Kathy Taylor, whose hits include “Oh How Precious” and “Corinthian Song” are keeping her traveling the globe, when the soulful sisters recorded “I Will Bless The Lord.” The stirring hymn is a glorious offering from two women who are anointed and not ashamed of the gospel and the gifts placed in them.\n\nWith HIGHER, Regina Belle has a simple but powerful message. “I pray that each listener has an experience. My whole objective in doing this record is to bring people into the presence of God. Some of us don’t always get there through the preached word. The music is only second to that, but I want to be able to know that I did my job and if you don’t have words to say, then use my words. If you don’t have a voice, then use my voice. If you don’t have the music or the setting, use mine. I believe that my music helps people get to a special place.” That place is a closer walk with God, one that is sweeter, deeper, richer and HIGHER!\n\n\"This album is something that I needed to do, for me,\" Elliott Yamin says of the aptly-titled Let's Get to What's Real, his third album and his first Purpose Music Group/eOne release. \"It feels right, and it feels like who I am as an artist. I wanted to make something raw and soulful and organic, so I went wherever the music moved me.\"\n\nYamin has already earned a prestigious reputation as both a world-class recording artist and a deeply compelling live performer, having built an impressive body of work as well as an intensely loyal international fan base. On Let's Get to What's Real, the multi-talented artist raises the musical and personal stakes, tapping into the emotional honesty and sonic intimacy of classic soul to create the most inspired and distinctive music he's ever made. The resulting album is the purest expression to date of the musical talent and personal charisma that were first introduced to the public during Yamin's stint as one of the most acclaimed performers to ever compete on TV's American Idol.\n\n\"I wanted to get back to making real music with real musicians and real instruments,\" Yamin says of the new disc. \"There were some hints of that on my first album, but my second album was pretty much machine-driven. I like that kind of music too, but this time I wanted to create music about real issues and make a record which reflects this.â\n\nYamin's fresh new creative leap is apparent on such impassioned new tunes as the intimate, insistent \"Self Control,\" the rousingly upbeat \"Gather 'Round,\" the poignantly autobiographical \"Virginia\" and the commanding title track, whose lyrical sentiments underline the sense of personal commitment that Yamin brought to the project. Those tracks find the artist decisively reinventing his sound, reaching back to the heartfelt immediacy of vintage R&B while remaining firmly grounded in the present.\n\nYamin co-wrote and co-produced Let's Get to What's Real with longtime collaborators Brett Nolan and Aaron Goldstein, who also played various instruments on the sessions. \"I wanted to have the same producers for this whole album, which I'd never had before, and I wanted to be totally involved in the production, the mixing, the vocal arrangements, from start to finish,\" Yamin asserts. \"I really got to get my hands dirty this time, and I learned so much making this album. I think it personifies who I am as a singer and songwriter. Artists are supposed to grow and test boundaries and challenge themselves, and I feel like I got to do that with this record.\"\n\nThe only two songs on the album not co-written by Yamin are the infectious \"I'll Be That Bridge\" and the aforementioned title number. Both of those tunes were penned by Brett Nolan's father, veteran tunesmith Kenny Nolan, renowned for writing such hits as \"My Eyes Adored You\" and \"Lady Marmalade,\" as well as his own '70s smash \"I Like Dreamin'.\"\n\n\"It was very inspiring having Kenny involved with this project,\" Yamin notes. \"He'd come by during our sessions and he'd play songs for me here and there, and some of them really stuck, including the two on the album. We recorded the album at Kenny and Brett's studio in Van Nuys; it has so much history and so much ambience, and Kenny and the studio played a big role in how the album turned out.\"\n\nElliott Yamin was born in Los Angeles and soon after, his family moved to Pasadena, CA where he first discovered his vocal talent while singing with his neighbors. Yamin later moved to Richmond, VA as a youth, and soon found employment singing cover material in a local jazz group and working as a DJ on a local R&B radio station. It was here that he auditioned for American Idol and won a spot in the show's competition during its 2006 season. Simon Cowell described him as \"potentially the best male vocalist,\" while guest Stevie Wonder encouraged him to pursue music full-time.\n\nYamin launched his recording career with his highly anticipated 2007 debut album Elliott Yamin, which debuted at Number Three on the Billboard album chart and was the highest-debuting album by an independent artist in SoundScan history. The self-titled disc achieved gold status in the U.S. and Japan (where he continues to maintain a large audience), and yielded the hit \"Wait for You.\"\n\nIn the wake of the first album's release, Yamin received considerable media exposure on countless television shows, while gaining extensive performing experience by touring around the world with his live band. In late 2007, he released the Christmas-themed Sounds of the Season: The Elliott Yamin Holiday Collection, which would be reissued in expanded form the following year as My Kind of Holiday. Yamin's second official album, Fight for Love, followed in 2009, spawning the successful singles \"Fight for Love\" and \"Can't Keep on Loving You (From a Distance).\"\n\nYamin's international touring activities have included several trips to far-flung locales on behalf of a variety of charities, relief groups and peace organizations. He's also worked tirelessly as an activist and spokesman for a number of organizations promoting awareness, advocacy and aid for those living with diabetes. Yamin's close rapport with his fans has allowed him to road-test many of Let's Get to What's Real's songs. \"I've been fortunate to get out there and play a lot of this material before the album was released,\" he reports, \"Everywhere we've been so far, the fans have responded really positively. My fans tend to feel personally invested in what I'm doing, and it feels like they're with me on this part of the journey too.\n\n\"I'm so proud of this album; it really feels like me,\" he concludes. \"This whole project was such a positive experience, and I had such an amazing time making it. If I can keep making records like this, I'll be a very happy guy.\" 3\n\nJade Starling best known as one half of the late 80s duo Pretty Poison (#1 platinum hit \"Catch Me I'm Falling\" on Virgin Records) will be releasing her much anticipated new solo album âCaptiveâ in Fall 2013. âCaptiveâ will feature collaborations with Lee Dagger of the hugely successful English remix team Bimbo Jones (Lady GaGa, Kylie Minogue, Rhianna etc.), DJ Laszlo currently on a streak of number one Billboard Club hits including (Selina Gomezâs âCome & Get It, âKelly Clarksonâs Dark Side and Justin Beiber / Nicki Manajâs Beauty and A Beat) and French DJ/remixer Franck Dona (Universal France) âInsomniakâ, the first official single from âCaptiveâ with mixes from Lee Dagger, DJ Scott Mann Dark Intensity, Bisbetic (Italy), Alex Preston (Austrailia) and the award winning Dj/Remixer/Producer Chris Cox will be released on Oct. 15. The video for âInsomniakâ was shot in the âHigh Hollowâ mansion which was originally owned by William S. Paley who essentially founded CBS Broadcasting. This club anthem is notable for its lush vocal verse and hypnotic buildup to a stellar instrumental hook.\n\nâI first made contact with Lee Dagger after hiring Bimbo Joneâs to remix my âDance Revolutionâ single. We hit it off well and decided to explore collaborating. Within a short period of time Lee & I along with my long time writing partner Whey Cooler have written eight songs together so farâ (âOnly Loveâ, âEvery lil Beatâ, âSubliminalâ, âInsomniakâ, âThinkin About Uâ, âSpontaneousâ, âPlace In The Sunâ and âAwakeâ), all of which can be heard on âCaptiveâ.\n\nSimilarly, DJ Laszlo has several collaborations making it onto âCaptiveâ (âBetter and Betterâ, âLove of A Lifetimeâ, and âRunaway Heartsâ) The LP is rounded out by the Franck Dona collaboration âEverything in the Worldâ and the Starling/ Cooler compositions âP.I.M.P.â, âCaptiveâ and âDance Revolutionâ also remixed by Bimbo Jones.\n\nDuring July 2013, Jade scored a major coup by raising over $20,000 during a very successful Kickstarter campaign, the proceeds from which will be used to fund the promotion of the new âINSOMNIAKâ single. On Aug. 13th 2013, Jade performed live at the âHouse of Bluesâ in Atlantic City where she was introduced by Colin Cosell the grandson of legendary sports caster Howard Cosell. This was the featured Promo Only party at the 21st annual DJ TIMES DJ Expo. In addition to this, Jade was featured on the Artist panel and gave an award to Internet Radio station âFusionâ. Also on the bill were EDM superstars Krewella and Luciana of DJ Tiesto fame. Pretty Poisonâs âCatch Me I'm Fallingâ is celebrating its 25th anniversary during the Spring of 2013.

I’ve always been very fortunate to have parents who told me that I could be anything I wanted to be. Call me naÃ¯ve, but I believed them completely and have never looked back. I grew up reading books about faraway places and fascinating people that taught me that there is a whole big world out there that I want to be a part of. Between my family’s unwavering support and my book-fueled imagination, I learned that it was not only okay to dream big but also encouraged. So I reached for the stars and ended up at the number one university in the nation in one of the most beautiful and booming states in the country.\n\nOf all the ways you could succeed in your life, why have you chosen to succeed in the Miss America Pageant? Success is such an ambiguous term, but I choose to define it as the ability and freedom to pursue the things I’m passionate about and help others in need. I will only consider myself successful if I look forward to going to work because I’m doing something that I love. And if money plays any role in the definition of success, I just want to have enough to share with others. I want to be Miss America because it would allow me to do both of those thingsâpursue my passion for fighting illiteracy and helping othersâwhich would be the ultimate success.\n\nWhat social issue, other than your platform, will have the greatest impact on your generation and why? Besides illiteracy, I think self-confidence issues are becoming more and more of a problem for today’s youth. My generation’s struggle for self-confidence is the root cause of many other issues, including bullying, teen suicide, eating disorders, and substance abuse. I think if we can get to the root of the problem and make young people feel better about themselves, then we can solve a lot of other problems as well."
