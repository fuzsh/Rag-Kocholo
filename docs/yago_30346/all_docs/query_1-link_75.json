        "text": "Here are restaurants from our favorite soaps. What soap restaurants am I missing?\n\nAll My Children\n\nConFusion\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nThe Cellar – a night club\n\nMonaLisa’s\n\nThe Yacht Club\n\nOasis – Night club managed by Eddie Silva\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nThe Bikini Bar – a beach bar where people usually wear swimsuit.\n\nLL Giardino – a nice restaurant, with outside seating, Shelia Carter was a waitress. Deacon purchased it and switched their focus to high class Pizza.\n\nDark Shadows\n\nBlue Whale\n\nCollinsport Inn\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nBrady Pub – Restaurant/Bar run by various members of the Brady family and the main center of the town, the way the hospital is on General Hospital\n\nDoug’s Place – Restaurant/Bar with a nicer selection of booze than the Brady Club. It’s more upper middle class and has a secret window that goes through the bar so they can shoot scenes through the bard into the restaurant\n\nGreen Mountain Lodge was a Salem getaway hotspot in the 1990s. (Soap Opera Digest, March 11, 2019)\n\nJava Cafe – Nicole worked there when she first came to town in 1998 (Soap Opera Digest, July 24, 2017)\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nThe Brown Dog Bar – Another dive bar where Finn was getting drunk and some underage teens came in because “they never card here.”\n\nCharlie’s Place – A dive bar that has sort of taken the Floating Rib’s place in the story, although in a different location, the Rib still exists. Josslyn Jax loves the fries, Kristina Davis works as a waitress and Julian Jerome bought the place when he became a reformed man after his sister Olivia pushed him over the edge\n\nEckhert’s – I guess it’s a bakery. Curtis stopped at their Donut Window to bring Portia lemon donuts for New Year’s in 2024.\n\nFloating Rib – Luke’s Bar, a dive bar with a little bit of a younger edge, they have pool tables. It exploded and then opened in a new spot.\n\nThe Haunted Star – A nightclub on a yacht.\n\nKelly’s Diner – A 1950s style diner owned by Bobbie Spencer in the late 2010s. It used be famous for egg salad sandwiches. Carly bought the place at a bargain rate to pay what she owed the government for her insider trading conviction.\n\nMetro Court – A stylish, upper class hotel restaurant, used for a lot of big parties\n\nParadise Lounge – Sonny’s strip club\n\nPerks – A very small restaurant with a walk-up service window with all the seating outside. It serves Corinthos Coffee.\n\nPort Charles Grille – I haven’t actually seen it, but I think it’s upper class. Victor Cassadine picked it as a place to go.\n\nSavoy – Curtis’s restaurant with a back room Mrs. Wu used for gambling.\n\nGuiding Light\n\nIn 1987 Roxie Shayne says Sal’s is the best place in Springfield to get pizza.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nCrimson Lights – Nick and Sharon Newman bought their college hangout, coffee shop Crimson Lights in 1999. It cycled through several owners before Sharon bought it back.\n\nGeona City Athletic Club (GCAC) although we never knew it existed until Gina’s Restaurant burnt down, it’s now THE place in town to have a luncheon meal or a drink. They call it by its initial letters GCAC. It has a roof deck bar and pool on the roof. When the GCAC came back they added a jazz lounge dedicated to the late Neil Winters.\n\nGina’s – Gina’s was Gina Roma’s restaurant which was a nice quality restaurant. It also had a couple of rooms. She let Jack stay in one after his father threw him out of the house because he slept with Jill. Gina also sang there on a regular basis and sometimes other people did, too. Gina was Danny’s Romalotti’s sister, but she had shortened her last name. The place burned down after Kevin Fisher started a fire in an effort to kill Colleen Carleton who tried to protect her friend Lily Winters from his predatory actions. Kevin had locked Collen in the restaurant’s freezer and JT Hellstorm saved her.\n\nGlam Club – Noah’s restaurant opened in Fall 2022 and disappeared mid-2023.\n\nSociety opened in May 2019, owned by Devon Hamilton, managed by Abby Newman, and chef Lola Rosales.\n\nTop of the Tower – A high end restaurant on top of the tower of Newman Enterprises. There are three distinct areas: the bar, the dining room, and the landing by the elevator.\n\nUnderground – Nick’s nightclub where he had a booth dedicated and inscribed to his then wife, Sage. Noah worked with him there. It burnt down almost killing the current teen set at the time.\n\nLAST UPDATED August 12, 2024\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca

following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKarter – Katie Logan and Carter Walton\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQuarter – Quinn Fuller and Carter Walton\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nSheacon – Shelia Carter and Deacon Sharpe\n\nSinn – Steffy Forrester and Dr. John “Finn” Finnegan\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThamber – Thomas Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nCaustin – Carrie Brady and Austin Reed\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJelle – EJ Dimera and Belle Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.

I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKarter – Katie Logan and Carter Walton\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQuarter – Quinn Fuller and Carter Walton\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nSheacon – Shelia Carter and Deacon Sharpe\n\nSinn – Steffy Forrester and Dr. John “Finn” Finnegan\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThamber – Thomas Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nCaustin – Carrie Brady and Austin Reed\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJelle – EJ Dimera and Belle Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.

Tom was the son of the coolest man in Oakdale, Bob Hughes, and Lisa Hughes on As the World Turns. During Deas time on the show Tom fell in love with Margo, an Oakdale police officer. They had an incredibly romantic adventure searching for Mr. Big. It was one of the best summer soap stories ever. Margaret Colin was my all time favorite Margo. She was brilliant. I also highly recommend her movie The Return of Sherlock Holmes where she played a descendent of Dr. John Watson – Jane Watson. I really enjoyed her Leg Work show which gets a shout out in the article.\n\nDavison, Valerie. “The Other Half: Mr. Wonderful.” Soap Opera Weekly, vol. 9, no. 44. 3 Nov. 1998. p. 34.\n\nMr. Wonderful: Margaret Colin says she’s a sucker for the romantic notions of her husband, GL‘s Justin Deas\n\nIn 1981, while he was playing Tom Hughes on As the World Turns, Justin Deas (now Buzz Cooper on Guiding Light) was invited to drop in at a birthday party for Marget Colin, who was playing police-woman Margo Montgomery. “Why would I do that?” was his response. “She hates me!” It was an overstatement, perhaps, but she HAD decided he was a bit nuts. Frustrated by the frequent technical interruptions during his lengthy courtroom scnes Deas had started taking flying punches at the camera. “Don’t worry,” Colin told her mother. “I’m never going out with this one. He’s crazy!”\n\nFamous last words. Before long Tom and Margo were embroiled in an adventurous storyline, and Justin and Margaret were involved in a mercurial romance. “They started writing for us,” Colin says, “and I was completely taken with him. He was the most spectacular actor I’d ever laid my eyes on, and he still is. They wrote extraordinary, romantic things for us because it suited Justin, and it certainly suited me.” Shamelessly imitating art, life continued to be combustible for the duo, though Colin left the show in 1983 and moved on to a successful career in prime time and film. “It was a tumultuous courtship, just because of the nature of our personalities – break up, back together; break up, back together. One time, when we were broken up, I said “That’s it. This isn’t gonna work. He’s a handful!” Then I heard he’d gotten a movie in London; and I made up with him in a heartbeat. He said, “Ya wanna come?” I said, “Yes!” and we were back together. It’s the truth. Ask anybody.”\n\nIt took more than trips to London, of course, or even the excitement of a roller-coaster courtship for “She hates me” and “He’s crazy” to morph into “I do,” which it did in January 1988. This past May (1997) he threw her a birthday party – dinner on the Rockefeller yacht, sailing around New York harbor, complete with roses on the table and “everybody I know.” It was apparently only one such gesture among many. “He is the most romantic man I’ve ever know,” Colin swears. “He’s the most romantic man I’ve ever heard of. He never stops.” She pauses, then adds. “Well, it’s NOT constant, or I’d be a diabetic.”\n\nWit and intelligence are at the heart of Colin‘s persona. Her head seems always slightly cocked; her bemused brown eyes are forever saying, “Hmmm,” and at lest one corner of her mouth appears always to be inching up. Her trademark voice is pitched at sub-basement level and is what separates her, she says, from Elizabeth Perkins, with whom she is often confused. Still, her recognition quotient is higer than it might be for a less distinctive actress, considering that four of the five prime-time series on which she has been featured (Sibs, Leg Work, Wright Verdicts, and Foley Square) have lasted less than a year. Chicago Hope, on which she played Dr. Karen Antonovich – pediatric brain surgeon and love interest to Aaron Shutt (Adam Arkin) – is still going strong, but Dr. Karen was killed off in the first season. Leg Work lasted a mere two months, though it did have a respectable syndication on cable’s Lifetime Network. “It was created for me, and we loved making it,” she says, “but I don’t think CBS knew what to do with it. We started in August and went to December: Justin and I got married at the end of January; so I didn’t have time to feel sorry for myself because the show closed. It was time to get married.”\n\nWith a father who retired as a deputy inspector from the New York City police department and a mother who was a crop duster, Colin‘s choice of career seems tame. She has much stage work to her credit, especially with Manhattan Theatre Club, and she recently completed the New York run of Jackie, in which she portrayed Jacqueline Kennedy Onasssis. It was her Broadway debut and won her a Theater World Award. “It wasn’t really intimidating to play her,” Colin says. “I was never a Jackie O-phile, but I did grow to admire her enormously in the course of the research . She began to fold over into my life as I realized there were other methods of getting your way than what I was used to . There is this ladylike approach, which is much more attractive than screaming and yelling. When I was playing Jackie, I just sat around with a big grin on my face, [which puts] everybody at ease.” She also learned how Jackie kept that pillbox hat on the back of her head. “Combs,” she growls succinctly. “My mother figured it out.”\n\nColin’s film credits include Pretty in Pink, Three Men and a Baby, Independence Day, and The Devil’s Own. One of hter best roles was on the small screen, however, as the Boston Globe reporter in Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston, although she was barely recognizable except for the trademark voice and comic overtones. “I had Just had my first kid,” she explains, “and it was the heaviest I had ever worked.” Colin and Deas have two sons – Sammy, who’s now 8, and Joey, who just turned 5. Their names were chosen carefully. Michael, for example, was not an option ; they didn’t want to risk his being called Mickey Deas. “We’re both thrilled with the joy of raising children and the challenge of trying to accommodate a double-career family, but Justin has been the one who was adjusted, because of his schedule. I think it’s a choice he felt the responsibility to make. Some days it’s OK with him, some days it’s not, but [he loves being] a dad, and he loves the job on the show.”\n\nNeither time nor parenthood, however, has diminished the incendiary nature of their chemistry. “We have a life together and we have spectacular child,” she submits, “But when he mixes it up, I don’t know where we’re going to go.” Not that she’s complaining. When asked if her husband is anything like the character he plays, she scoffs, “Oh, he’s much more interesting than Buzz. Buzz is really stupid.”\n\nYou don’t often find soap operas worked into the main stream of American history (although they should). One big exception to the rule is the Kennedy Assassination. President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas as part of a parade on the way to big lunch event. The Kennedys had arrived that morning at the airport and were going through their normal slate of what were basically campaign events. Since it was lunchtime As the World Turns, the number one soap opera, was on the air.\n\nNobody knew what to do. There are no rule books for what to do when something happens that shocks and rattles the entire country. What you always see before Walter Conkrite‘s break in news alert is a scene featuring Grandpa Hughes (Santos Ortega) and Nancy Hughes (Helen Wagner), his daughter-in-law. According to Bob Hughes, Nancy’s son (Don Hastings) the backstage people were told (there was a TV presence there covering the events so word was passed along quickly). He heard them say, “The President is shot, don’t tell the actors.” Then they had to do the scene. Part way through they cut to an announcement during that scene. After the bulletin and before they decided to go to all news, As the World Turns was put back on and it was when they went to the all news format that they cut away from Grandpa Hughes and Nancy.\n\nBelow you have links to short pieces of the Television Academy interviews where both Wagner and Hastings talk about the event. I also added William Bell‘s. He didn’t really talk about the immediate aftermath, but he does talk about what the show did after. I wish we had those 2 scenes he talks about. This was Thanksgiving week and the all news format lasted 4 days before TV people felt it was time to try to work back to normal. I’m sharing this now because of the Thanksgiving connection.\n\nDon Hastings:\n\nHelen Wagner:\n\nWilliam Bell:\n\nI will mention in passing that the assassination would have a huge effect on television news. It was the first time TV found itself playing the role of touchstone for the entire country. It was the start of what would later become on cable the 24 hour news cycle which has negatively effected our coverage because instead of focusing on deep background pieces to make sure people are truly educated about the news, they feel compelled to constantly add something shocking enough that people won’t change the channel. Finally it skyrocked the careers of many staffers who just happened to be in Texas at the time since none of the current big wigs were there to take part of that coverage. Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer (Founders of The MacNeil/Lehrer Report, today known as the PBS NewsHour), Bob Schieffer (CBS’ chief Washington correspondent and host of the Sunday talk show Face the Nation), Peter Jennings (20 year anchor of ABC’s World News Tonight – he wasn’t in Texas he flew down immediately from Canada to cover the shooting), and Dan Rather (24 years as CBS’s Evening News anchor). Learn more about them here.\n\nNOTE: I’d like to add after 24 years Rather was fired for fabricating a news story that agreed with his politics, but wasn’t true – not even close – and Rather and most of the rest of the media conveniently forget that when they interview him, etc. which always irritates me because he was fired for betraying the very trust he’s always brought on to say how terrible other people are for similar violations and HE would never do that. It’s like he had an honorable retirement instead of what actually happened.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHere’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far. If you spot I’m missing one from any daytime soap, please let me know on Facebook, Twitter, in the comments below or by e-mailing me at Robansuefarm@hotmail.com\n\nAll My Children\n\nBAM – Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone\n\nGreenleo – Greenlee Smythe and Leo du Pres\n\nJamanda – Dr. Joseph “Jake” Henry Martin Jr. and Amanda Dillion\n\nJannie – Adam Chandler III and Adam Lavery\n\nMinx – Bianca Montgomery and Marisa Ramirez, Binx was Bianca’s nickname.\n\nRylee – Ryan Lavery and Greenlee Smythe\n\nZendall – Kendall Hart and Zach Slater\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nNutMeg – Meg Snyder once she went around the bend.\n\nBenry – Barbara Ryan and Henry Coleman\n\nCarJack – Carly Tenney and Jack Snyder\n\nHEM – Hal Munson and Emily Stewart\n\nJacket – Jack Snyder and Janet Ciccone\n\nJolly – Jack McKinnon and Molly Conlan\n\nLinden – Lily Walsh and Holden Snyder\n\nLuRe – Luciano “Luke” Snyder and Reid Oliver\n\nLusty – Lucy Montgomery and Dusty Donovan\n\nNuke – Noah Mayer and Luciano “Luke” Snyder\n\nPEG – Paul Ryan and Meg Snyder\n\nPEM – Paul Ryan and Emily Stewart\n\nWillen – Will Munson and Gwen Norbeck\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\n$Bill – Dollar Bill – Nickname for Bill Spencer\n\nBatie – Bill Spencer and Katie Logan\n\nBeric – Brooke Logan and Eric Forester\n\nBreacon – Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe\n\nBricky – Brooke Logan and Nick Marone\n\nBridge – Brooke Logan and Ridge Forrester\n\nBrill – Brooke Logan and Bill Spencer\n\nCaRidge – Caroline Spencer Forrester and Ridge Forrester\n\nCarMas – Caroline Spencer and Thomas Forrester\n\nDEric – Donna Logan and Eric Forrester\n\nDeQuinn – Deacon Sharpe and Quinn Fuller\n\nDUstin – Donna Logan and Justin Barber\n\nHott – Hope Logan and Wyatt Spencer\n\nKari – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kridge\n\nKarter – Katie Logan and Carter Walton\n\nKridge – Katie Logan and Ridge Forrester aka Kari (I don’t really acknowledge Kridge as it sounds like something you’d scrape out of a fish filter)\n\nLally – Liam Spencer and Sally Spectra II\n\nLivy – Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nLope – Liam Spencer and Hope Logan\n\nNicket – Nick Marone and Bridget Logan\n\nQuarter – Quinn Fuller and Carter Walton\n\nQueric – Quinn Fuller and Eric Forrester\n\nQuiam – Quinn Fuller and Liam Spencer\n\nQuidge – Quinn Fuller and Ridge Forrester\n\nRamber – Rick Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nRashley – Ridge Forrester and Ashley Abbott\n\nRaya – Rick Forrester and Maya Avant\n\nStatt – Steffy Forrester and Wyatt Spencer aka Wyffy\n\nSteam – Steffy Forrester and Liam Spencer\n\nStill – Steffy Forrester and Bill Spencer\n\nTally – Thomas Forrester and Sally Spectra, Jr.\n\nThacy – Thorne Forrester and Macy Spectra\n\nThamber – Thomas Forrester and Amber Moore\n\nThatie – Thorne Forrester and Katie Logan\n\nThrooke – Thorne Forrester and Brooke Logan\n\nTridge – Taylor Hays and Ridge Forrester\n\nWally – Wyatt Spencer and Sally Spectra Jr.\n\nWatie – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka WyKat\n\nWivy – Wyatt Spencer and Ivy Forrester\n\nWyKat – Wyatt Spencer and Katie Logan aka Watie\n\nWyffy – Wyatt Spencer and Steffy Forrester aka Statt\n\nZencole – Zende Forester and Nicole Avant\n\nZensasha – Zende Forester and Sasha Thompson\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nFauxBo – When Bo Brady was replaced by a duplicate\n\nGabby – When Abby Deveraux split into alters including a version of Gabi Hernandez\n\nAbben – Abby Deveraux and Ben Rogers\n\nBope – Bo Brady and Hope Williams\n\nBrave – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Breve\n\nBristen – Brady Black and Kristen Dimera\n\nBreve – Brady Black and Eve Donovan aka Brave\n\nBroe – Brady Black and Chloe Lane\n\nChabby – Chad Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nChabi – Chad Dimera and Gabi Hernandez\n\nCin – Ciara Brady and Ben Rogers\n\nDannifer – Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton\n\nEJAbby – EJ Dimera and Abby Deveraux\n\nEJami – EJ Dimera and Sami Brady\n\nEJelle – EJ Dimera and Belle Brady\n\nEJole – EJ Dimera and Nicole Walker\n\nElani – Eli Grant and Lani Price\n\nEricole – Eric Brady and Nicole Walker\n\nHaiden – Hope Williams and Aiden Jennings\n\nHorita – Will Horton and Paul Narita\n\nJaige – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Paige Larson\n\nJarlena – John Black and Marlena Evans\n\nJenEric – Jennifer Horton and Eric Brady\n\nJeve – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Eve Donovan\n\nJNJ – Jack Devereux and Jennifer Horton\n\nJresa – Jack “JJ” Devereux and Theresa Donovan\n\nKeddie – Kate Roberts and Eduardo Hernandez\n\nLuloe – Lucas Horton and Chloe Lane\n\nLumi – Lucas Horton and Sami Brady\n\nLush – Lucas Horton and Sheryl Connors\n\nPaulSon – Paul Narita and Sonny Kiriakis\n\nPhloe – Phillip Kiriakis and Chloe Lane\n\nRope – Rafe Hernandez and Hope Williams\n\nShelle – Shawn Brady and Belle Black\n\nStabi – Stefan O.
