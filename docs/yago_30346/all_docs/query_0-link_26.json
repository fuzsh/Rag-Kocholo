        "text": "GH Spoilers! DON'T LOOK! 🫣😧🙄\n\nDiane will be intrigued over a discovery during the week of August 28-September 1, so she might find some legal loophole she can exploit.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) will want to give up on his physical therapy and leave his facility early, but Stella Henry (Vernee Watson) will do her best to talk some sense into him.\n\nOver with Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring), she’ll fling a beverage at Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight) as she grills him about the secrets he’s been keeping – especially when it comes to those payments from Pine Valley. Martin will do his best to explain away his lies, but he’ll further frustrate Lucy when he makes excuses to avoid helping her prepare for court.\n\nLucy will get a different attorney named Elise (Carly Hughes) to handle the lawsuit case for her, but Elise will have her work cut out for her since she’ll be going up against Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey).\n\nTracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) will make a splash when her involvement in all this becomes clear to Lucy, who’ll worry her empire’s about to crumble!\n\nNext, Gladys Corbin (Bonnie Burroughs) will fill Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) on her gambling problem and will reveal that Dr. Damon Montague (Darin Toonder) is demanding money in exchange for Sasha Gilmore’s release.\n\nAlthough Gladys will downplay her role in Sasha’s suffering, she’ll make it clear that she needs Nina’s help.\n\nNina will agree to cover Gladys’ debts, but she’ll want to give Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) updates – and that’ll be a huge problem for Gladys.\n\nIf Nina indeed comes clean to Sonny, he could figure out Gladys cooked up a plot with Dr. Montague so she could continue to control Sasha’s finances.\n\nAs for Cody Bell (Josh Kelly), he’ll fake a mental episode and try to get himself locked away at Ferncliff. Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) has agreed to help Cody, but this plan will come with plenty of risks.\n\nOther GH spoilers say Selina Wu’s (Lydia Look) plot will be thwarted, so her latest attempt to gain control of The Savoy apparently won’t work out.\n\nMeanwhile, Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) will deliver a proposition and work to sell someone on the idea. This might involve making some family plans – ones that Gregory Chase (Gregory Harrison) might not be able to participate in due to his decline.\n\nWhatever the case, it seems Gregory may hold off on telling Chase the truth about his ALS since he knows it’ll break his son’s heart.\n\nDuring the week of September 4-8, there’ll be much more Port Charles drama. After an encore airs on September 4, the show will be back with all-new episodes.\n\nAnna Devane (Finola Hughes) will follow Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart), but that could lead to a new perspective.\n\nValentin may have some good reasons for the secrets he’s keeping since Anna will ultimately apologize.\n\nAt Pentonville, Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) will mess with Drew and leave him uneasy. The longer Drew stays behind bars with Cyrus, the more danger he could be in.\n\nOver with Sonny, he’ll land in a tricky situation. Diane will be summoned around this time, so she may have to get Sonny out of a legal jam.\n\nCarly will push for answers, so she might corner Dex Heller (Evan Hofer) and get him to explain how Sonny got stuck in his latest mess.\n\nBack with Cody, he’ll be more determined than ever to help Sasha. Once Cody is presumably committed to Ferncliff as planned, he’ll try to come to Sasha’s rescue in her room.\n\nCody will have an eye-opening experience, so he may learn more about Dr. Montague’s plot with Gladys as he does his best to tackle all the chaos.\n\nSam will also confess to someone, so Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) surely won’t be happy when he finds out how far she went to assist with Cody’s Ferncliff plan.\n\nHowever, Mac Scorpio (John J. York) will show fierce determination, so he may not think Cody belongs at Ferncliff and could fight to free him. That might lead to Mac visiting Cody, who can tell him what he’s learned about shady Dr. Montague and Gladys.\n\nWhile Molly Lansing-Davis (Brooke Anne Smith) and Kristina Corinthos-Davis (Kate Mansi) get into another heated argument, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) will get honest with Nina. Alexis’ blunt approach may come across as rude, but Nina might appreciate hearing the truth anyway.\n\nPerhaps Alexis will remind Nina of her mistakes and warn about how she can repeat them if she wants to build a real relationship with Willow Corinthos (Katelyn MacMullen).\n\nNina will also get some guidance from Ava Jerome (Maura West), but it’s safe to say Nina will inevitably make more mistakes along the way!\n\nElsewhere, “Eddie Maine” aka Ned Quartermaine (Wally Kurth) will put on quite a show, so he’ll be loving his rock-and-roll lifestyle. That could make it harder for Olivia Quartermaine (Lisa LoCicero) to jog “Eddie’s” memory when she tries.\n\nJosslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) will also serve as a confidant – first for Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali) and then for Dex. You can bet Josslyn will do her best to listen intently and offer advice.\n\nAs for Gregory, he’ll try to gather the courage to do something, but he’ll lose confidence in the end. It sounds like Gregory may bail on telling Chase the truth about his ALS and delay the confession even longer."
