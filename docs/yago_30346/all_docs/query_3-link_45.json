        "text": "As Kassie DePaiva prepares to return to our screens as Blair on GENERAL HOSPITAL, please join us in wishing her a very happy anniversary! The actress is marking 30 years since her debut as Blair Cramer on ONE LIFE TO LIVE, and some of her fans gathered together to give her a very special gift to celebrate the achievement!\n\n“Thank you so much for the beautiful clock to commemorate 30 years of Blair!” DePaiva declared on X. “Thank you, fans, for a wonderful journey and it’s an honor to share it with you! Each of you made it happen!”\n\nA group of 30 fans signed a letter that read: “Yours is a timeless talent. Our admiration for you is unwavering and our love for you is eternal. Celebrating 30 amazing years.” Their gift was a rosewood pillar clock with a plaque that says: “Celebrating 30 Years of a Timeless Talent.”\n\nTechnically, the anniversary celebration is just a little early as DePaiva didn’t make her debut on OLTL until December 1993. The actress remained with the soap until its final episode on ABC in 2012, picking up a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2005. She then reprised the role on GH for some appearances in 2012 and again for the short-lived online reboot of OLTL in 2013. Now, 10 years after fans last saw Blair on TV, she’s coming back for a couple more episodes of GH to stir up even more drama!\n\nAlthough perhaps best known for playing Blair, DePaiva has actually been working in soaps for nearly four decades, having made her daytime debut playing Chelsea Reardon on CBS sudser GUIDING LIGHT back in 1986. She also appeared on NBC, playing a recast of Eve Donovan on DAYS OF OUR LIVES (and earning two more Emmy nods), a role she recently reprised for an episode in August.\n\nFingers crossed that DePaiva’s brief return to GH as Blair is just the start of something more because we’d love nothing more than to celebrate even more years of her playing the iconic character!"
