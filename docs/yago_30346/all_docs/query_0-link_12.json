        "text": "By\n\nSoap fan favorite, Kassie DePaiva is making a return to ABC’s General Hospital in her role as Blair Cramer from One Life to Live.\n\nA rep for the daytime drama series confirmed to TV Line that DePaiva will begin airing in September. DePaiva appeared as Llanview’s Blair before on GH.\n\nAfter One Life to Live ended in 2012, and in March of that year, GH kicked-off a crossover story that featured DePaiva along with Roger Howarth, formerly Todd Manning on One Life and GH.\n\nWhile Howarth has remained at GH in other roles over the years including as Franco Baldwin and Austin Gatlin-Holt, DePaiva has also been playing Days of our Lives’ Eve Donovan on and off. She recently appeared on the Peacock streaming soap opera earlier this month when she reprised Eve for a short stint.\n\nDePaiva recently spoke to Soap Opera Digest saying she would love a chance to back to GH and reprise Blair, but she added, “I guess Todd is not Todd, right?’ So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go,‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.’”\n\nLooking forward to seeing Blair on GH again? What story would you like to see her involved with?
