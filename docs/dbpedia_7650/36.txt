Tim LaHaye, the author of the best-selling "Left Behind" book series died today (July 25), according to his ministry. He was 90.

Family members said Dr. LaHaye passed away in a San Diego hospital after suffering a stroke several days ago. A native of Detroit, LaHaye is most noted for his best-selling book series "Left Behind," novels about the return of Jesus and the Rapture as described in the Bible.

LaHaye and co-author Jerry B. Jenkins wrote 16 volumes of the series which sold more than 80 million copies. Since the first book's release in 1995, the works have topped the best-sellers lists of The New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, and Christian Booksellers Association.

LaHaye was a Baptist minister who started a church in Atlanta and then went on to become active in evangelical causes, pastoring in South Carolina and Minnesota. He and his family later moved to San Diego County, where he took over Scott Memorial Baptist Church, now known as Shadow Mountain Community Church. He is credited with encouraging Jerry Falwell Jr. to establish the Moral Majority to advocate for conservative Christian causes.

LaHaye also founded two accredited Christian high schools and San Diego Christian College.

LaHaye' s wife, the former Beverly Ratcliffe whom he married on July 5, 1947, founded Concerned Women for America in 1979, a political action group with more than 600,000 members. The two also hosted a radio show and television program on family life.

Funeral plans for LaHaye have not been announced.
