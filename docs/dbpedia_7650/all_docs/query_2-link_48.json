        "text": "AKA Timothy F. LaHaye\n\nBorn: 27-Apr-1926\n\nBirthplace: Detroit, MI\n\nDied: 25-Jul-2016\n\nLocation of death: San Diego, CA\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Baptist\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Religion, Novelist\n\nParty Affiliation: Republican\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Left Behind series\n\nLeft Behind is a 13-book series (plus three prequels) in the \"Christian fiction\" genre, dramatizing the circumstances surrounding our inevitable Rapture (scheduled to transpire any day now). And as of 2004, the series has sold more than 62 million copies. According to Newsweek, 71% of Left Behind readers reside in the South and Midwest, and just 6% from the Northeast. Evidently their core demographic is a 44-year-old born-again married mother living in the South.\n\nThe Left Behind books were the brainchild of Dr. Tim LaHaye, well known in conservative circles as a key player in the Religious Right movement. The books were primarily written by LaHaye's coauthor Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter. According to Jenkins: \"I write the best I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis. The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to read, you know?\"\n\nHe has also co-authored (with Bob Phillips) a second series of novels beginning with Babylon Rising in 2003. These novels are less popular but perhaps more action-packed, following the fictional adventures of Michael Murphy, a scholar of Biblical prophecy, through events allegedly based on present-day fulfillment of whatever prophecies were neglected in the Left Behind books.\n\nLaHaye believes that the Catholic Church \"is more dangerous than no religion because she substitutes religion for truth. [...] Rome is also dangerous because some of her doctrines are pseudo-Christian.\"\n\nWhen I ask him what he has against Catholics -- he says often that they will be under-represented among Christians taken up at the Rapture -- he is at a loss to answer. It is as if they were simply bad in his book, and that's that. Pressed, he suggests that it's because they do not believe that the way to salvation is to receive Jesus into their hearts.\n\n\"What about Holy Communion?\" I ask. \"Isn't that all about receiving Jesus, body and soul?\"\n\nThe great scholar of religion looks at me blankly. \"Maybe,\" he says. \"I really don't know.\"\n\nEvidently LaHaye believes that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. \"I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I am convinced that it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man during the past two hundred years.\"\n\nBelieves that homosexuality can be cured.\n\nFather: Frank LaHaye (Ford auto worker, d. 1936)\n\nMother: Margaret Palmer\n\nWife: Beverly LaHaye (m. 5-Jul-1947, until his death, two daughters, two sons)\n\nDaughter: Linda\n\nSon: Larry\n\nSon: Lee\n\nDaughter: Lori\n\nTheological: BA, Bob Jones University (1962)\n\nTheological: DMin, Western Conservative Baptist Seminary, Portland, OR (1977)\n\nCoalition for Religious Freedom Cochairman\n\nCoalition on Revival\n\nConcerned Women for America Cofounder\n\nCouncil for National Policy President, Cofounder\n\nHuckabee for President\n\nJohn Birch Society\n\nMoral Majority Board of Directors\n\nEvolution Skeptics\n\nTime Magazine 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America\n\nRisk Factors: Homophobia\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.timlahaye.com/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nHow to Be Happy though Married (1968, non-fiction)\n\nTransformed Temperaments (1971, non-fiction)\n\nThe Beginning of the End (1972, apocalypse study)\n\nRevelation: Illustrated and Made Plain (1975, apocalypse study)\n\nHow to Win over Depression (1976, non-fiction)\n\nThe Ark on Ararat (1976, Bible analysis; with John David Morris)\n\nThe Act of Marriage (1976, non-fiction; with Beverly LaHaye)\n\nHow to study the Bible for Yourself (1976, non-fiction)\n\nUnderstanding the Male Temperament (1977, non-fiction)\n\nThe Battle for the Mind (1980, political comment)\n\nThe Battle for the Family (1982, political comment)\n\nAnger Is A Choice (1982, non-fiction; with Bob Phillips)\n\nThe Battle for the Public Schools (1982, political comment)\n\nThe Hidden Censors (1984, political comment)\n\nThe Race for the 21st Century (1986, political comment)\n\nHow to Study Bible Prophecy for Yourself (1990, apocalypse study)\n\nAgainst the Tide: How to Raise Sexually Pure Kids in an \"Anything-Goes\" World (1993, non-fiction; with Beverly LaHaye)\n\nA Nation without A Conscience (1994, political comment; with Beverly LaHaye)\n\nLeft Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (1995, with Jerry B.
