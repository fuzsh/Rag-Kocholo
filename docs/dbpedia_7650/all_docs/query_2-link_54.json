        "text": "SAN DIEGO, July 26 (UPI) -- Tim LaHaye, the well-respected leader of the American evangelical movement, inspiration to Jerry Falwell and co-author of the 16 best-selling Left Behind novels died Monday after suffering a stroke last week. He was 90.\n\nThe Left Behind novels, co-written with Jerry B. Jenkins, sold millions and cracked the mainstream beginning in the 1990s with tales based on the Bible's Book of Revelation and followed a group of people \"left behind\" after the second coming of Jesus."
