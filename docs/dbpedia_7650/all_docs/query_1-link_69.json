Jenkins. The celebrated speaker has written over 50 books during his literary career, dabbling in both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nBiography\n\nHailing from Detroit, Michigan, Frank LaHaye’s heart attack and subsequent death in 1936 has a powerful impact upon nine year old Tim LaHaye; despairing and largely inconsolable, Tim found solace in Christianity, following a conversation with the minister at the funeral, whose words that his father’s death wasn’t the absolute end of Frank LaHaye allowed the young boy a moment of hope and comfort within the words of the Bible.\n\nTim entered the Army at the age of 18 shortly after finishing night school, his role restricted to that of machine gunner aboard a bomber in Europe. Following his short military career, Tim LaHaye sought to further his studies, eventually acquiring a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Bob Jones University and a Doctor of Ministry Degree from Western Seminary.\n\nHe would eventually find a home in San Diego, becoming the pastor of Scott memorial Baptist Church and founding Christian Heritage College in 1971.\n\nTim LaHaye is often referenced in connection to his political activism, the writer taking steps to make his voice heard through the numerous groups he either promoted or founded, this including the Institute for Creation Research and the Council for National Policy.\n\nEventually leaving the pulpit after 25 years to focus on his writing and politics, Tim’s activities within the political arena are typically informed by his Christian beliefs, with the majority of his projects often purposed to promote biblical views and opinions within the public space.\n\nMany a conservative presidential candidate have, over the years, admitted to enjoying considerable support from Tim LaHaye, whose ability to rally the Religious Right was instrumental in George W. Bush’s successful Bid for Presidency in 2000.\n\nThe Left Behind Series\n\nThe majority of Tim’s literary career has come to revolve around ‘Left Behind’ the series of apocalypse themed novels for which he is best known. Telling the story of earth in the aftermath of the pre-tribulation rapture, the concept was solely the creation of Tim LaHaye, this despite the fact that it was Jerry B. Jenkins, a sportswriter that actually penned the books using Tim’s notes.\n\nTim has never made any effort to hide the role his friend Jerry played in bringing his ideas to light, admitting on several occasions that he wasn’t the most brilliant fictional writer in the industry.\n\nThe novels, which include 13 titles that chronicle the primary story along with three prequels, are highly popular, having sold over 65 million copies since they first emerged in 1995 and often compared to the works of great writers such as Stephen King and Tom Clancy because of their brisk plotting.\n\nThe books were adapted into a series of three movies between 2000 and 2005, as well as a fourth movie in 2014 starring Nicolas Cage (Considered to be a reboot of the original series).\n\nThe novels also spawned a PC video game (Left Behind: Eternal forces) as well as numerous sequels.\n\nTim LaHaye has attracted both intrigue and criticism for his various opinions on the world, this including his strong anti homosexuality stance (and the book he wrote in 1978) to support his views), his thoughts on the illuminati and their present impact upon global events and the numerous attacks he has launched against the Catholic Church, referring to them as pagan in nature and using words like ‘Arch priest of Satan’ in describing the position of the pope.\n\nTim’s beliefs about the rapture and upcoming apocalyptic events have also placed him in the cross hairs of various evangelical preachers on a number of occasions, this along with his association with Sun Myung Moon.\n\nTim’s works outside the Left Behind series include the End Series, The Jesus Chronicles and Babylon rising.\n\nLeft Behind\n\nTerror strikes an airborne Boeing 747 heading for London when passengers begin disappearing into thin air without any warnings. It is a terror that not only grips the plane but which manifests all across the world. As unusual events begin to unfold, only a select few know the truth of what is happening; that the apocalypse has begun.\n\nReviews on the first book in the Left Behind series differed greatly when it was first released and little has changed since then; the perceptions of readers tend to vary depending upon their own personal beliefs, with those whose world is rooted in the bible finding entertainment and thrills in the novel, while those that hold Christian values in disdain find little to no enjoyment from the words of Jerry B. Jenkins.\n\nThe novel is, none the less, one of the most popular in the Left Behind series, those few objective minds that have read it boasting of its swift pace and determination to entertain even while delivering Tim LaHaye’s message.\n\nTribulation Force\n\nWhen Millions of people around the world seemingly disappear, those left behind are faced with terror as war, famine and various plagues descend upon the planet; with so many perishing, one small band of heroes will stand to contend against the new World Order of the Antichrist.\n\nChloe Steel, Buck Williams, Rayford Steele and Bruce Barnes are the tribulation force and they will have to fight the enemies of their Lord during the seven years of chaos that the world is about to experience.\n\nTribulation Force throws the Left behind series head first into the chaos of that follows the emergence of the Antichrist, making for a novel that manages to thrill even while irritating many a reader.\n\nThe primary complaint against Tribulation Force often emerges from the dialogue, the majority of which is not only accused of being too plastic but simply running on for so long that it occupies a large portion of the novel.\n\nNone the less the final verdicts on Tribulation Force are typically driven by the fact that it is Christian fiction, in which case opinions will vary largely dependent upon one’s religious beliefs and how they might be presented within the novel’s pages. Few, however, can fault Jerry B. Jenkins’ writing, specifically his ability to engage those readers that are willing to give the book a decent chance.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » Tim LaHaye\n\nOne Response to “Tim LaHaye”"
