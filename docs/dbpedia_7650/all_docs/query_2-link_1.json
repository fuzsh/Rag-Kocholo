        "text": "The Rev. Tim LaHaye, a leader of the Christian fundamentalist movement and co-author of the best-selling “Left Behind” series of apocalyptic novels prophesying mass slaughters and the end of the world, died on Monday in a San Diego area hospital. He was 90.\n\nHis death, days after he had a stroke, was announced on the website for his Tim LaHaye Ministries.\n\nIn an age of seemingly endless natural and man-made disasters, the action-packed tales by Dr. LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins struck readers as all too realistic, even if they were based on biblical accounts of the Second Coming, the appearance of an Antichrist and multitudes leaving a calamitous dying world for heaven.\n\nSome critics said that the books, with potboiler plots, characters in conflict and plenty of violence, elevated the sermonizing of old-fashioned Christian fiction into the realms of modern page-turning thrillers by John Grisham, Tom Clancy or Stephen King. Others called them tedious, fatuous, preposterous and exploitative.\n\nAnd there were darker interpretations by critics who detected anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism and other religious biases in Scriptural adaptations that focused on questions of death, resurrection, salvation and immortality from a strictly Christian fundamentalist point of view.\n\nThe series — 16 volumes that appeared between 1995 and 2007, including sequels, prequels, children’s versions and translations into many languages, as well as spinoff movies, DVDs, audio dramatizations, video games and clothing — sold more than 65 million copies and was perhaps the most commercially successful Christian fiction in publishing history.\n\nThey made fortunes for Dr. LaHaye, who created the series and drafted outlines for the stories based on the Books of Isaiah, Ezekiel and Revelation, and for Mr. Jenkins, a former sportswriter who did the actual writing. Dr. LaHaye also wrote or helped write about 50 other books of fiction and nonfiction, and Mr. Jenkins nearly 100 books, including biographies of sports figures.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
