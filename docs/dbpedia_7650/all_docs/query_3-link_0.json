        "text": "July 23, 2011\n\nAs one who always reads other reviews before reading and reviewing a book, I feel like I should respond to what some of the other reviewers have to say. First of all, some complain that the writing style is too sophomoric. Well, every writer has his voice, and how interesting would the world be if everyone wrote or spoke exactly the same way? Yes, the writing style is simple, but that just makes the book(s) easier too read. Secondly, as to the complaints that the books are sexist, that's just silly. In fact, you can even see that the writers probably felt obligated to respond to those claims by giving the character Chloe some strange dialogue, such as telling Tsion that she felt insulted when he called her a \"precious little one.\" At any rate, Chloe's character is as strong a female lead as a reader can ever hope for.\n\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I feel that the writers have come a good distance with character development, as I find myself actually caring what happens to them and feeling some emotion with what they are going through. They learn, they grow, they make mistakes, they are as human as fictional characters could be. Also, the writers have gotten better at building suspense. There is no immediate gratification when something mysterious comes up -- sometimes you have to wait several chapters to find out what is going on. And finally, they do a good job keeping you guessing with who is the \"good guy\" and who is an \"impostor.\" It really puts you in a place to relate to what the characters must be feeling. I will definitely continue on in this series.\n\nOctober 21, 2008\n\nOkay, so another reason to dislike these books is the good math. Ready? Alright. One of the main characters is pregnant, right? And has been for lets give them the benefit of the doubt three months at the beginning of the book. Okay. Now: There is a five-month plague of demon locusts (just take it at face value) and anyone stung by them will be writhing in pain for a) the rest of the five months that the plague exists, and b) for five whole months after that. When does the main character give birth? Just as people start coming out of the terrible pain. Basic maths mean that she was pregnant for 13 months at a minimum. This means one of three things: 1) she's pregnant with the AntiChrist, but that can't be, because we know who the AntiChrist is. 2) She's an elephant, which I'm not cutting out as a possibility. Or, 3) LeHaye and Jenkins are impossibly bad at math.\n\nAugust 9, 2021\n\nLeft Behind: Apollyon carries on the torch of squandered potential and disjointed storytelling with neither flair nor flounder. It’s “the boring one.” The book lingers below the heights of disfunction charted by Tribulation Force, but also offers less to keep the reader engaged. Of the entries in the series so far, Apollyon is not the worst, but it has perhaps the least to offer.\n\nThis book took me a while to complete, and this review took longer to write. So much of what’s terrible — the prose, the misogyny, the passive main characters, the preachiness, etc. — is a continuation of what’s been present throughout the rest of the books. The repetition is numbing. I try not to tread the same ground with each review unless there’s something new to say. And five books in, myself and the authors are hitting the same wall. So, instead of covering everything, this will be more of an overview and discussion of the things that have changed with Apollyon. What got better, what got worse, and what sticks out like a lump that wasn’t there in our last checkup?\n\nTo begin, here’s the lay of the land. Book four was all about the aftermath of yet another apocalyptic event. Millions are dead, cities were destroyed. Our heroes raced around the globe, literally digging through the wreckage (twice!) to find their women, dead or alive. Where will the thrilling adventure lead us next? To a conference! *pause for dramatic effect* A solid two-thirds of this book is concerned with planning, attending, and escaping a conference where the current preacher-protagonist (the first one died in book two) gives a globally-broadcast series of sermons. There are some gems in the middle of all this (like a scene where all of the new Christians are compelled by Jesus to guzzle bottles of water that turns to blood in anyone else’s mouth), but the rest is as dry as it sounds. Trying to remember the contents of this section feels like recalling TV static. If you have ever spent an afternoon enchanted by daytime televangelists, then you will be on the edge of your seat.\n\nMeanwhile, and I’m shocked to write this, Hattie undergoes the most compelling character arc in the series, but is somehow NOT the main character. I mentioned earlier that a series trademark is squandering potential story ideas, and this one hurts the most. After fleeing the Antichrist and enduring a miscarriage, Hattie is on the blood path, and none of the pleas from our protagonists can dissuade her from killing her evil ex-boyfriend. With this setup, any competent writer would see that they had stumbled into writing the only active protagonist in the series — a potential Linda-Hamilton-in-Terminator-2 type lead to carry us forward. Fellow Hattie stans, I ask for a moment of silence as we mourn the revenge plot we will never get, but which we are promised by LaHaye and Jenkins in this book. Since the next one is titled “Assassins,” I have to assume Hattie and some of our main characters will finally get around to doing something about that Antichrist. But we all know it won’t amount to anything empowering for our female cast. The biggest red flag is the amount of time our male protagonists spend in this book deciding which one of them has dibs on the near-dead woman in their care. Guess who gets the I-can-fix-her romance subplot? It would be totally unethical and gross if it was her primary physician, but that’s never stopped these writers! It seems to me (total guess here; I don’t know where this series is headed) that Hattie will be redeemed right before she dies. She’ll say the sinner’s prayer, probably after she gets revenge on Carpathia, and also probably in the arms of the doctor she’ll fall in love with. These books like punishing women, and, as she expresses repeatedly throughout the book, Hattie has the most punishable offenses. I just don’t see a future where these authors let the “whore of Babylon” live to the end, let alone become the driving force of the plot for the rest of the series. So, here’s to you, Hattie. No matter what happens, we’ll always have Apollyon.\n\nMoving on, I see by the table to the left of my pulpit that I have some Backhanded Compliment trophies to award. First up, the Accidentally Meaningful award goes to the plot structure, which begins with a miscarriage and ends with a birth. This creates a pleasing death/life symmetry for the story, and makes it feel like we’ve come full circle. It further poises Hattie and Chloe as foils, marking a symbolic divergence in their lives. Since it revolves around the internal states of two women, however, I have no choice but to assume any meaning other than the pure plot points are unintentional.\n\nNext, the No News is Good News award goes to the first two thirds of the book, because, for once, all of the POV characters are in the right place to see the plot happen. There are almost no scenes of characters hearing about key events from a news anchor, and it feels revolutionary. I am saddened, however, to say that the last third of the book has so many news scenes that it evens out the quota, negating the award entirely. So sad — and just when you thought they were learning.\n\nLast, but not least, a twofer: the What a Twist award is presented to a sudden, gruesome character death in the third act and to the first traitor Christian the series has given us. Neither amount to much of consequence, but they did surprise me. Shoutout to the runner-up: Chloe’s subplot about starting a Christian blackmarket. It would have scored higher on surprise scale were it not for my old friends pedaling MLM products on Facebook.\n\nNow for some observations that are just backhanded, no compliments attached. The villains get really weird treatment by this book. This is the first entry where Carpathia and friends aren’t driving the plot. Consequently, the only scenes we get with them are slapstick shenanigans where God dunks on them for being rascals. When they aren’t having microphone troubles or literally tripping over each other, the bad guys are trading insults and getting made fun of for their outfits and long names. It’s like the authors couldn’t think of anything new that would make the audience hate the Antichrist, so they just made them incompetent and gave them goofy peripherals. The book already has pacing issues, and, on top of that, the antagonists aren’t a threat. That’s why most of this book is so boring. When the plot actually does pick up for the final third, it isn’t the villains providing the antagonistic force — God is.\n\nFor all of the previous books, the Antichrist & co. have been the source for most of the fear-mongering to make readers convert. With them out of the picture, the horror is now coming from God and from his instruments, be they the Witnesses, tribulations, or demons God has explicitly let loose on the world. The plagues that end the book are more horrific than anything in up to this point. Nearly every non-Christian is incapacitated by pain but cannot die. Literal torture. For months. It is baffling that a series whose whole schtick is scaring people into converting flubs the messaging in this way. The authors are unaware that they have made God evil.\n\nIn spite of all the negatives, there is some pleasure to be gained from this entry in the Left Behind saga. The writing continues to reward those readers plundering the worst of the worst for hilarious lines. And if humor doesn’t do it for you, then maybe schadenfreude will satiate you.\n\nBy this point in the series, I don’t think the authors are having fun. And (if I may take a cue from them) let’s jump forward in time at the very end of my rambling. Looking back, we can see that they suffered a fitting punishment for this garbage: being stuck writing seven more books before they could be free.\n\nAnd then four prequels.\n\nAnd a kid’s series.\n\nNovember 29, 2021\n\nAction, suspense, and the story is in full swing. Yes please.\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nI’m in so deep now. I am thoroughly enjoying this series reread. 🔥🤩\n\nAugust 8, 2018\n\nAppollyon is the fifth book in the Left Behind Series. Things continue to pick up as the world faces more and more Trumpet Judgements. Getting further into the Tribulation-the period after the Rapture but before the Glorious Appearing- the world’s surviving population is facing yet another large blow to its numbers.\n\nWith the so-called blessing of the Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia, the great conference of witnesses is scheduled to occur in Israel. After being exonerated of earlier accusations of the murder of his family, Tsion Ben-Judah is given “permission” to come back to his homeland of Israel to speak to the 144,000 witnesses prophesied about in the book of revelations.\n\nCarpathia, not wanting to be outshone, makes a special guest appearance. Here he tries to assure everyone of his open and passive nature. He does not see any reason for open hostility. He wants everyone to practice the religion they believe in but wants this group to join the One World Faith. What he gets instead is a crowd that refuses to listen to him. It is then that Israel’s water supply turns to blood… at least for nonbelievers that is.\n\nIt is on the last day of this conference that all hell breaks loose. There is a Global Community attack which forces the Tribulation Force to flee. They head back to Chaim Rosenweig’s house that is basically an old fortress and is equipped with a helipad. But their escape back to the States does not go as planned. As they are running from the helicopter to the plane that will fly them to safety, one of our beloved members is shot and killed. Buck is unable to make it onto the plane at all leaving him injured and stranded in Israel. This is bad news for Buck since he is an international fugitive from the GC.\n\nMeanwhile Hattie is rushed to the hospital. She is pregnant, but battling a severe illness, or more likely she is suffering from being poisoned by Carpathia. Will her baby survive? Will she? Do we want to know what the child of the Antichrist looks like?\n\nBuck, still trying to get home to the States, finds his way back to Chaim Rosenweig’s where he can bide his time until arrangements can be made. The fourth Trumpet Judgement makes the stars, moon and sun 1/3 less bright causing temperatures to drop significantly. Now that everything is running on solar power, courtesy of the Global Community, this complicates Buck’s plans for rescue even further. The worst part? Chloe goes into labor while he is in Israel.\n\nOnce again this book is one hell of a page-turner. It’s nonstop action and excitement. You find yourself wondering if our Tribulation Force will ever catch a break knowing fully well that they will not. Not until they die and meet their maker or until the Glorious Appearing where they will be rewarded for their efforts. Their burden gets stronger by the day. They must save every soul they can and the window of opportunity is getting smaller and smaller.\n\nI am so glad that I made the decision to pick these up this year. I have been fully immersed in this world that LeHaye and Jenkins have created. There is almost nothing I enjoy more than an end of the world tale. Death and destruction. Chaos. I love it. And this is proving to be a super fun and exciting series.\n\nJuly 29, 2019\n\nThey must have been getting flack by this time about the racism and sexism, but their fix is to add some magical ethnic people to work for the white evangelicals. They gave a woman some important work but still ask her husband if it's ok to lie to her about her pregnancy. Other than those changes it's still the same fear mongering, prosperity gospel and conspiracy evil as the rest of the series.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nMy rating doesn't reflect my theological beliefs nor my view of eschatology, my rating is solely based on the entertainment value of the book.\n\nNovember 11, 2020\n\nAnother excellent addition to the Left Behind series.\n\nHubby and I both enjoyed it very much.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 27, 2023\n\nRereading this series decades later I am astonished how well they've held up. Still can't wait to get to the next one\n\nApril 3, 2016\n\nIn this, the fifth book of the \"Left Behind\" series, the writing has definitely improved, for the most part. Another big improvement is a noticeable lessening of illogical actions and events that were so annoying in earlier volumes. That is not to say that is is completely lacking, though. In this book, we are reminded of the revelation in the \"Soul Harvest\" that Carpathia had Bruce Barnes poisoned. The question is, \"Why?\". At the time, Bruce (and the \"Tribulation Force\" as a whole) was no great threat to either Carpathia or the Global Community. The story, however, is still the same flaccid, tepid series of escapes, rescues, and chases that we have become used to from these authors. It also shows the same lack of imagination that has plagued this series from the beginning. Once again, the action reads like something stolen from a second rate movie or a two bit TV show and are further robbed of any tension or suspense by the characters constantly reminding each other that God is protecting them, so they are, ultimately, safe from any serious harm. Add in the fact that the authors have given me no real reason to care about the characters, and what should have been exciting scenes crackling with tension and concern are nothing more than just a boring sequence of words. Even the title of the book is nothing more than a cheap attempt to grab the readers' interest. Apollyon, \"chief demon of the abyss\", never puts in an appearance. When his horde of demon locusts finally put in an appearnce, about two-thirds of the way in, they are only there for about two chapters and are not all that terrifying. They sting people once, causing swelling and pain, and then move on. Perhaps that is the greatest downfall of these books: they are too tame. These events should be terrifying and heart-rending, but come across as limp and comical. (Witness the slapstick scene of Bo and Ernie trying to escape the locusts.) Even the descriptions of scenes of decadence and liscentiousness are watered down to the point where the most abominable actions include men kissing other men and (horrors of horrors!) tattoo parlors. These books aren't just a waste of time and paper. They are also a waste of a great opportunity to give us frightening, exciting, gut-wrenching stories.\n\nJanuary 14, 2012\n\nBook #5 of this series has Raymond sneaking out of Israel to save his life and Buck, Chloe, and Tsion going to Israel to hold a huge conference for the witnesses. I never figured out why and that theme held true through most of this book. So much of what happened in this book left me thinking why would they do that or how could they do that? The main characters are constantly putting themselves in situations that noone should survive, yet they do things that if the world conditions really were as they are discribed in the book would be impossible for them to do.\n\nEither because the writing is just not that good or because my thought process is wired differently from the authors, I keep thinking along the lines of how? There was a major earthquake but because of solor power all these torn up houses have power to run? After that much distruction it would take a long time for power lines to be fixed but they have no problems with having food or cooking it? I get the solar power thing, but how is the power getting to the destroyed houses? And all of the gas stations are ok to the point they have no problems always having gas for the cars, after a major earthquake? These people, who none of are trained hackers or techs, suddenly can hide there websites and phone calls from the most powerful person in the world?\n\nIf you're not the kind of person these things bother then you may not have any problems with the story. The characters are in and out of danger, they're having a baby, and there is some good scripture written throughout the book. There's characters that you like a great deal finally coming to the light.\n\nI will continue to read the series as overall it is good one, with a good meaning behind it, some of the books are better than others.\n\nSeptember 19, 2011\n\nThis is the Left Behind book that made me the maddest. However it did not dissuade me from continuing the series. You'd think with a book called Apollyon: The Destroyer Is Unleashed there would at the very least be a character names Apollyon in the book. Sadly, no. There is not even a \"destoyer.\" The name Apollyon is mentioned twice but no demon lord arises as I mistakenly believed. There are however these ridiculous demon hybrid locusts. They're 3 to 4 inches long with the 12 part segmented body of a horse and the head of a man with long flowing hair. Oh ya and they can talk. They only bite the unbelievers and when they do their victims have 5 months of agony where there are even unable to commit suicide. These locusts eventually die off. These books aren't bad but they're not good either. But the writers do do one thing right. They are compulsively readable with intriguing characters and cliffhangers galore.\n\nAugust 22, 2010\n\nThese books started as a guilty pleasure, a mindless read suggested by my students. However, as the series goes on, the writing grows worse. At this point, I'm only continuing to read them because I'm curious how this train wreck of a series grew so popular and how it came to a close after something like 13 books.\n\nJuly 23, 2016\n\nThe beginning started off slow but quickly built up towards the middle and held strong all the way to the end. A very satisfying fifth installment to the Left Behind Series.\n\nPros\n\nIntense\n\nSuspense\n\nClift hangers\n\nPlot twists\n\nCharacter development\n\nPlot development\n\nCons\n\nNothing\n\nMay 30, 2016\n\nAh this one was really good too! I liked this storyline, and things are getting pretty intense now! I can't wait to keep reading this series!\n\nDecember 7, 2019\n\nNeeded more flying horse scorpions. And cowbell. Cowbell was virtually absent and people definitely had fevers.\n\nApril 4, 2020\n\nExcellent series so far. Starting the next book...Assassins!\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nUgh! How disappointing! This book did not pick up where it left off in the last book. It had nothing more to say about the first three trumpets sounding off and the destruction that followed, which was just barely mentioned, as in a passing comment as if, nothing to see here, folks! Ridiculous! I believe they have made the characters and their silly little stories more important than the actual Biblical events the author is trying to tell us about. This book was literally all idle chit-chat about this and that as multitudes made there way to Israel, and to the Wailing Wall to hear the anointed Tsion Ben-Judah give his message to the believers. You would never know the world was in chaos and that the Lord would soon be arriving in just a few more years. It wasn’t until page 262 before there was even a mention of the 4th Trumpet.\n\nThey were now two years into the Tribulation. They had another 1-1/2 years before, what is considered the Great Tribulation, would begin, bringing on monumental catastrophe like none could imagine. Meanwhile, even the next 1-1/2 years would be worse than what they had experienced so far on earth. In those last years of the Great Tribulation, Luke 21 reminds us: \"There will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea in the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven would be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your head, because your redemption draws near.\"\n\nBefore the 4th Trumpet sound and devastation was brought against the people, Buck, his pregnant wife Chloe, Ken the saved pilot, Rayford and the anointed Tsion Ben-Judah had returned to Israel for the great gathering. Afterwards, the GC (Global Community) were onto all of them and were going to have them killed, so they had to flee in a quick getaway. Ken was shot and killed in front of Buck as Buck just landed on the airplane steps. The plane was already moving to take off, but he got caught in wiring on the step rails and couldn’t make it aboard. The plane took off and had just barely made a fence line when Buck was able to detangle himself and fall back to the ground in the brush.\n\nAfterwards, and for some reason, a scene on page 247, actually drew some kind of emotions from me and made me cry. It wasn’t the story, it wasn’t the character cause I have no feelings for none of the characters. Buck made his way back to the Wailing Wall. He was lost, confused, disheartened, torn apart, and didn’t know what to do. He needed to be in God’s presence. He walked past the angry and scared crowd of people and up to the gate to see if Moishe and Eli would have advice for his aching heart from losing Ken. People were hollering at him to stay back, calling him a fool and idiot. Buck didn’t care. He needed God’s word. As he got close, the two saints spoke directly to him in a way that only Buck could hear. And right there, believe it or not, I started to cry and feel for the first time in this whole series. Buck was in God’s presence and receiving God’s words directly as he looked into the eyes of the two prophets, needing to feel God's touch. How I would love to see and hear God’s words and feel his touch, telling me that I am worthy too and to hold fast.\n\nWhen the 4th Trumpet sounded off, it struck and permanently cut off 1/3 of the light from the sun, moon and stars. Daylight was only 2/3's as bright. The sun shone 2/3's as bright, temporarily bringing on winter-like temperatures until an angel flew through heaven and gave warning to the remaining inhabitants of the earth, an audible, out-loud warning that every human being clearly heard, before the final three angels sounded off. Woe to the people!\n\nBuck made his way around Israel and was living temporarily in the safe haven of a new believer's home. When one morning, as he stepped outside into the clear bright sunshine, the sky suddenly darkened. Morning turned to twilight and the temperature dropped. He knew the 4th Trumpet had sounded off. (Revelations 8:12) All across the world temperatures plummeted to blizzard like conditions. Energy stores were diminished, all except for the potentate Nicolae and his people, who had directed extra capacity to their bunkers in New Babylon. Meanwhile, people were trying to keep warm and many were dying. Just like FAKE news today, Nicolae dressed up in his antarctic weather gear and put out an all-weather bulletin while in front of the Wailing Wall in an attempt to negotiate with the two prophets Eli and Moishe, who they believe had cursed the earth. But, there was no negotiating! The prophets spoke out, \"Woe to you who do not lift your heads to the sky!\" Nicolae walked up to the camera, and as a show of \"props\", denounced all the lies and blame he had laid on the previous scholarly believers. In two days, the weather and the light of day returned to normal.\n\nThe 5th Trumpet sounded off. Astronomers and scientists all over the world had their telescopes out and were following an object, known in Revelations as Wormwood, barreling straight towards earth. It landed and created a smoke so thick and far-reaching that it blocked the sun and spread around the world. End! Nothing else mentioned about this. More idle chit-chat like it was just another day in paradise.\n\nThe 6th Trumpet sound off sent a swarm of locust down to earth like never before seen. Out of the pitch black smoke came hideous black, yellow and brown little monsters, demons, with loud pitch screams like the sound of metal brushing together, here to attack everyone without the seal on their foreheads, causing great pain and the body to swell. The locust were the size of a man's hand, with the body of a horse, the face of a man and teeth like those of a lion. Their tails were translucent scorpion tails filled with venom which was clearly visible. The locusts also had a voice. They chanted, in Greek, \"Apollyon, Apollyon, Apollyon.\" And in Hebrew, they chanted, \"Abbadon, Abbadon, Abbadon.\"The victims wanted to die, and prayed for death, but death did not come. The Lord did not allow death at this time...nor for the next 5 months. Nicolae and his side kick, Fortunato, were well protected. All other commanding officers were attacked along with all other unbelievers.\n\nThis book ends with the warning of the 6th Trumpet and its devastation to be pronounced. Two hundred million horsemen will slay another 1/3 of the world's population. (Revelation 9:12-15)\n\nRegardless, onto the next book, No 6 “Assassins’. I’d hate to quit now with only 3 books left in the series. Hopefully, the next book will be full of real visual action and a feel of what the real Tribulation will be like.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 20, 2023\n\nFor what it’s worth, this series does an exceptional job capturing the tone and priorities of living in end-times driven evangelicalism in the 90s-2000s (and even today, in many ways). I’ve been re-reading the series as a way of processing religious trauma, and this book is where I stop. With each book, the pro-life talking points get louder and louder, yet in no way more nuanced or empathetic. If you’re open to hearing men explain pregnancy with unfounded confidence, women’s supposed role in society, and the importance of martyrdom for the sake of the unborn, then this book is a fine choice for you. Or, if you didn’t grow up in white evangelicalism and are curious what the experience is like, this is a decent case study.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nAn average entry in the series, with some character development but the book falls foul of really sticking to the previous book's structure of a lot of stuff happening, a brief respite and then A LOT more happening in the final 3 chapters. This does not give the reader time to adjust and was even a little frustrating in this novel. Let's hope book six breaks away from that structure, even just a little bit.\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nThis book is better than the previous one.\n\nThe are more thing going on here and the beginning was shocking. This story focuses more on Hattie’s suffering, Chloe’s pregnancy, and the locust plague.\n\nI’m continuing with the sixth book right now!\n\nOctober 27, 2020\n\nBook #5 continues to follow the Tribulation Force.\n\nApril 3, 2021\n\nThe series is getting better and better.\n\nAugust 16, 2021\n\nGood read\n\nThis book was great. Toward the end I really just wanted to slap Hattie. She's become a real moron. Her character keeps getting worse\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nBook five in the series and I continue to love these books!\n\nApril 17, 2018\n\nThis was a decent book to read in the series. I do not think it was quite as good as Soul Harvest, but it was still entertaining. This book initially takes place immediately after Soul Harvest, but then it ends up jumping \"ahead\" more than I remembered it doing or realized it did the first time around. I do think the authors have improved their story-telling with each successive novel, especially the dialogue. This book also had some crazy \"intense\" moments in it, where the heroes are forced to escape danger as best they can. Like any other book, it also has some periodic slow moments. The character development is decent; some new characters are introduced and some \"old ones\" are reintroduced to the storyline. As is the case in the previous books, there is more \"talking\" and \"discussions\" (and even lectures/teaching) than there is \"action.\" Sadly, one of the new members of the Tribulation Force also dies in this book while trying to escape.\n\nIt just hit me - the original pastor for the Tribulation Force said that of the original four members, at least one of them would die. He was the first to die from the original group.\n\nThe book main focuses on Tsion Ben-Judah teaching his \"flock\" of followers (Tribulation Saints) in Israel. He was there for maybe a week with the a large number of the 144,000 Jewish Christians in attendance; I was unsure of the \"exact timeline\" but I got the gist that this book covered the last few days of the \"conference\" followed by the escape of the majority of the Tribulation Force from Israel. After the group makes it back to the United States of America, the book then starts to jump around a bit more as it skips ahead into the \"future\" and the subsequent punishments/judgements from God. Buck is left behind in Israel as the rest of the group escapes from Israel; he ends up staying with Chaim until he is finally able to safely flee the country. While he is Israel, the judgement occurs in which the sun stops emitting 1/3rd of its energy to the Earth; in addition, 1/3rd of the luminescence of the night sky also disappears. From there, the plague of demonic locusts occurs after some sort of celestial object strikes the Earth and causes all sorts of geologic upheaval. These demonic locusts will plague non-believers for five months, and then those who are stung/bitten will suffer for another five months, so the entire time of the plague and its aftermath covers a total of ten months. After the 'end' of the plague, Chloe gives birth to her son. It is just 'interesting' that I did not realize how focused these books are, centering in on a specific period of time before jumping ahead to the next \"judgement\" and then leaving things to hang on a type of \"cliff-hanger\" of some sort, as at result. It really stands out to me now, and is kinda funny how they hook readers in to keep reading the series. The way this book ends, though, a person could ALMOST stop reading, except they would not know who of the group survives the rest of the Tribulation, they do not know if Hattie becomes a Christian or not, and they do not know how many people end up surviving.\n\nThere was definitely at least one anticlimactic moment in the book. During the initial stages of the demonic plague and subsequent torturing of the non-believers, the demon-locusts start chanting the name of their master. Some chant \"Abaddon\" and others chant \"Apollyon,\" as if they are waiting for their master to appear. Nothing happens. It was like - what the heck? Why waste time having them chant their master's name in Hebrew (Aramiac?) and Greek if their master is not going to appear at all in the novel? I would say it was definitely the \"weakest\" part of the book. I was waiting for . . . something. Something to happen. Some entity to appear and manifest itself. It was a great build-up that the authors wasted by not having anything happen after that. What was the point? What was the point of having these demon-insects chanting the master's name? Maybe something was cut out by their editors before the book was published? hahahah Probably not, but that would at least make sense as to why it was so . . . . disappointing. Probably the most disappointing moment in the book.\n\nThe various punishments and plagues dumped upon the Earth are hard to read. In some respects, it reminds me of the verse in Proverbs where it talks about how parents discipline their children out of love, out of an attempt at correcting bad/undesirable behavior. Yet, I still \"get\" the complaints that the punishments meted out in the various prophecies seem a little harsh; harsher than they need to be. I am not God; I do not have the eternal picture. I cannot say how or why the punishments would be justified. I do know how people justify themselves and their behavior, as none of us really understands the holiness or righteousness of God; we like to talk about how God is a God of love and peace and compassion and mercy; we do not like to talk about how God is also a God of righteousness and cannot abide sin. it is a conundrum. I will not deny, some of the comments made to justify the punishment being meted out on the Earth, while \"Biblical\" in nature, also seem trite. Again, I do not have the \"eternal perspective\" as I am quite limited in what I can understand, and I do not know everything or see everything or understand everything.\n\nThere were a couple of \"humorous\" moments that stood out to me in the book, for different reasons. The first one is when one of the Tribulation Force's newest members, a doctor, admits to Rayford he is falling in love with Hattie on pages 172 and 173. Rayford takes the good doctor to task about these growing feelings/infatuations. Some of the comments he makes are:\n\n\"Get a grip, Doctor. You're no teenager anymore. I hoped your obsession with her wasn't purely physical, but I should have known. You hardly know her, and what you know drives you batty by your own admission. Just behave yourself until we can get back and help you keep your senses.\"\n\nand\n\n\"And, Doc, remember, our absolute, number one, top priority with her is with her soul.\"\n\nor these two gems (blended into \"one sentence\"):\n\n\"I didn't hear any enthusiasm there, Floyd. . . . if you care a whit about her beyond your adolescent need to have her in your arms, you'll want above all else to make her a part of the family.\"\n\nThis whole of conversation really, really, really bugs me, because Rayford is the ultimate hypocrite in this part of the novel. He has this robe of self-righteousness that he is wearing while verbally flagellating the good Doctor. He has obviously forgotten that he, himself, before he became a Christian, had made the conscious decision to pursue Hattie and have an affair with her if she were interested. He clearly does not understand how righteous or holy God is to speak to Floyd in such a hypocritical manner. According to Jesus, God is so holy that Jesus said, \"but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart\" (Matthew 5:28 NASB). In addition, I Thessalonians 5:22 says to avoid every from of evil in some translations and other translations say to avoid the very appearance of evil/sinning. So, despite Rayford's protestations to the contrary, in the eyes of God, he did, indeed, commit adultery with Hattie before becoming a Christian. I realize Rayford is still a relatively \"new\" Christian (only a couple of years old, by this point, and no more than three years old, in his walk with Jesus) and has been focusing exclusively on the \"prophetic verses\" in the Bible. Still, though, it would be nice to see somebody slap him in the spiritual face with this verse about adultery, in my opinion. So, this was 'funny' to me in a negative sense, because the man is so hypocritical, claiming \"purity and innocence\" because he never actually consummated his desires for Hattie physically or sexually when in his heart he had already cheated on his wife and committed adultery with Hattie. In addition, he knew that his wife would not be happy with his flirting with Hattie and meeting her like he did for late dinners and drinks on a regular basis; Rayford really needs to cool his judgment and his jets in regard to others developing feelings or attachments to Hattie. I know God forgives, but that does not change what Rayford did or what he is apart from God. Sorry about the soap box, there.\n\nThe other \"moment\" I found funny (in a hilarious way) was the supreme confidence of Abdullah Smith. When Buck asks if their final stop on their journey is too small of an airport for Abdullah to land at, Abdullah says, \"I could land on an envelope and not cancel the stamp\" (389). It struck me as hilarious, and I loved it. There was another moment of levity earlier in the book, but I forgot to mark it down. This one was pretty good, though (and easy to remember as it was toward the end of the book).\n\nI did enjoy the description of what happened after the amount of sunlight striking the Earth was lessened by 1/3rd. The authors took it as being eight more hours of darkness; in addition, the amount of light \"striking the Earth\" from the stars (and reflected off the moon) was also cut by 1/3rd. I have never really thought about how such an event would adversely affect the Earth. The authors do a decently \"incredible\" job of describing the disintegration of the global environment and resulting deleterious affects on the global community. As most of the power supply on Earth is solar-based in nature, now, due to technology introduced by the Global Community, most of the Earth is without power for increasingly longer periods of time. In addition, the temperature has dropped dramatically, causing a \"mini-ice age\" of sorts. Crops can no longer grow, due to the decrease in solar energy (in decreased photosynthesis). Interestingly enough, though, the amount of oxygen does not seem to decrease despite the decreased abilities of vegetation to photosynthesize due to the decreased solar energy. It was pretty crazy, and it lasts for a \"long\" (indeterminate) amount of time.\n\nNow, as much as I appreciated the epiphany of how such a celestial event would adversely affect the Earth and the Earth's inhabitants, I did not like how the authors handled the \"end\" of this \"plague,\" this punishment. Carpathia approaches the Two Witnesses to try and broker a deal and negotiate the end of the decreases sunlight. The Witnesses tell Carpathia his offense is not against the two of them, implying he needs to discuss things with God. A few days later, the sun brightens back to its former energy output and the world is 'saved' (289). To be honest, I was surprised that Carpathia did not claim a \"victory\" here by saying it was due to his negotiations with the Two Witnesses that the Earth started receiving 100% of the Sun's \"normal output.\" It seemed like something he would have done. It was just weird timing; I also realize the Bible does not say how long this reduced solar energy would last. But, still. I did not care for how close the restoration of the solar output came after Carpathia attempted to bargain with the Two Witnesses.\n\nOne \"final thought\" before closing. It was crazy how hard-hearted people would become, especially in light of the fulfilled prophecies as described in the book. Hattie remained hard-hearted because she believed she was getting the punishment she deserved for the choices she made over the course of her life. Yet, when talking with her sister on the phone, Hattie told her sister to accept Christ and become a Christian/Tribulation Saint/Believer. So, even though Hattie knew the truth and that it would set her free, she refused to repent and believe because she believed she deserved to be punished and could not accept God's forgiveness. It was crazy!\n\nAlso, Chaim. Even though he had observed the fulfilment of various prophecies and had learned of Carpathia's duplicity, he still refused to become a Christian. He was forced to recognized he had more pride than he realized, but even then, despite his claims of \"being close,\" he still refused to bow his knees and surrender. It was pretty crazy, to be honest.\n\nOh, I almost forgot! I also enjoyed the primary discussion about setting up a \"secondary economic system\" to allow the Tribulation Saints to survive once the \"Mark of the Beast\" is instituted and Christians are no longer allowed to participate in the new global economy. Well, not just Christians. Anybody who does not bear the Mark cannot be a part of the global society, so the Tribulation Saints have to figure out a different way to survive. They have to come up with other commodities in order to be able to acquire what they need, and they decide to set up co-ops to facilitate the survival of the various Christian communities around the world. It starts with Ken Ritz; he has several airplanes and a bunch of gold stashed away, as well as plans on how to start these various co-ops. After his death, his plans are used to start setting up these co-ops around the world. It was very interesting stuff.\n\nIt was a good book, overall. It does not quite 'set the stage' for the next book in the series well, other than Chloe expressing for the first time she hopes she can be the instrument God uses to kill Carpathia and Hattie saying that her hatred for Carpathia and her desire for revenge by killing him were all that kept her alive and gave her purpose for her miserable life, but it still fits in well with the overall flow of the story of the Tribulation Force. I am glad that I took the time to reread the book.\n\nDecember 16, 2023\n\nFinished this book a couple weeks ago... and yes this series is still leaving me speechless. I may revisit my reviews on this series once I read all of the books."
