        "text": "Tim LaHaye, the evangelical leader and co-author of the best-selling “Left Behind” book series, died at a San Diego hospital on Monday after recently suffering a stroke. LaHaye, who lived in Alpine, was 90 years old.\n\nLaHaye was a TV evangelist and an early force in driving evangelical Christians to the polls and injecting their values into the political debate. But the man Time magazine named as one of the Top 25 most influential evangelicals in America is best known for the “Left Behind” books, the blockbuster Christian-fiction series that came to LaHaye on a whim and blew through the book world like a force of nature.\n\nThe “Left Behind” series dealt with life on Earth after true believers in Christ are taken to heaven, leaving the rest of the world in chaos. LaHaye said the idea came to him during an airplane flight, as he watched a married pilot flirting with an unmarried flight attendant. What would happen, he wondered, if the rapture came right now?\n\nThanks to LaHaye’s biblical expertise and longstanding interest in end times and co-writer Jerry B. Jenkins’ deft hand with thriller-like plots, this blip of an idea turned into 16 best-selling novels, beginning with 1995’s “Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth’s Last Days.”\n\nThe books have sold more than 65 million copies, with seven of them reaching No. 1 on the New York Times, USA Today and Publishers Weekly best-seller lists. Spinoffs include films, video games and an album of songs inspired by the series. The impact was as huge as the sales.\n\n“The ‘Left Behind’ series had massive sales, which was a first for Christian fiction,” said Lynn Garrett, senior religion editor for Publishers Weekly. “One of the main things it did was impress secular book chains like Barnes & Nobel enough that they were finally open to carrying Christian fiction. They were very plot-driven, and they were a good read that appealed to people outside the evangelical Christian world for the first time.\n\n“The sales got everybody’s attention, and that made a major impact on publishing. Not only have the big Christian publishers thrived, but the most of the major (mainstream) publishing houses started imprints or lines to publish Christian books.”\n\nBorn in Detroit in 1926, LaHaye came to San Diego with his family in the mid-1950s. He became pastor at Scott Memorial Church in North Park, which expanded to three locations, including what is now Shadow Mountain Community Church in El Cajon. His legacy stretched throughout San Diego County’s religious community and far beyond.\n\n“Dr. LaHaye has been a friend to me like no other,” said Dr. Paul Ague, president of San Diego Christian College in Santee, which LaHaye founded as Christian Heritage College in 1970. “The impact the LaHayes have had on the students has been remarkable. Dr. LaHaye was known on SDC’s campus as a constant encourager, a champion of the next generation, and a scholar of biblical wisdom. I have been blessed to call Tim a dear friend, and he will be missed greatly by the SDC community.”\n\nLaHaye was touched by religion early in life. His father, who was an autoworker, died when LaHaye was 9 years old. In a 2004 interview with the Christian Science Monitor, LaHaye remembered the minister’s eulogy and the hope it gave him that he would see his father again in heaven. That eulogy set LaHaye on a path that did not waver, even as it led him to the halls of Washington, D.C., and the top of the best-sellers list.\n\n“He was very pastoral,” said Jenkins, LaHayes’ co-writer on the “Left Behind” series. “I am a biographer, and I write about a lot of famous people. A lot of people are different with big shots than they are with waiters and other regular people. But he treated everyone the same. Billy Graham was like that, too. Everyone got the same treatment with him.”\n\nLaHaye earned his bachelor’s degree from Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a doctor of ministry degree from Western Theological Seminary and a doctor of literature degree from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. He also served in the Air Force.\n\nHe married the former Beverly Ratcliffe in 1947, and she went on to become his right-hand partner in life, religion and politics. The couple celebrated their 69th anniversary this month, and LaHaye celebrated his wife with a Facebook post to “my faithful partner in marriage, parenthood, ministry, and many things we never dreamed.”\n\nBefore LaHaye made his big splash in the publishing world, he was making waves in Washington, D.C. According to the obituary published on LaHaye’s website, he encouraged the late Jerry Falwell Sr. to establish the Moral Majority and take on what LaHaye saw as “a progressive agenda that was undermining traditional family values.”\n\nIn 1985, after LaHaye ended his run as a TV evangelist, Tim and Beverly LaHaye moved to Washington, D.C., for a time to continue the work started by Tim’s American Coalition for Traditional Values and Beverly’s Concerned Women for America. Both organizations worked to register voters in the evangelical Christian community and rally born-again Christians to vote on election day.\n\n“We also felt it was essential to get Christians more involved,” LaHaye told the San Diego Tribune in 1985. “Not only as candidates, but on behalf of good candidates.”\n\nLaHaye was credited with rallying evangelicals behind George W. Bush’s 2000 presidential campaign. In 2005, Time magazine named the LaHayes “The Christian Power Couple.” In addition to his political work and the “Left Behind” juggernaut, LaHayes wrote more than 60 non-fiction titles, and founded or co-founded the Tim LaHaye Ministries and the Tim LaHaye School of Prophecy at Liberty University.\n\nAccording to the website obituary, Tim and Beverly LaHayes donated millions to numerous religious institutions, including Liberty University and San Diego Christian College. He was also an avid jogger and golfer who remained active far into his 80s.\n\nThe family announced his passing on his ministry’s Facebook page. In addition to Beverly, LaHaye is survived by brother Richard LaHaye, sister Margaret White, four children, nine grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.\n\n“Tim was one of the most Godly men I have ever known,” Shadow Mountain Community Church pastor David Jeremiah said in a statement. “Tim’s ministry will continue for many years through the books he wrote, the organizations he founded and the people that he influenced. But I will miss him when I look out from my pulpit next Sunday.”"
