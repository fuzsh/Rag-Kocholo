        "text": "The latest thriller in a hugely popular Christian fundamentalist series about the Apocalypse will enter the New York Times fiction best-seller list at No. 1 on Sunday, an unparalleled achievement for an evangelical novel.\n\nThe book, ''The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession,'' by Tim F. LaHaye, a retired evangelical minister, and Jerry B. Jenkins, a professional writer, is the seventh installment in the ''Left Behind'' series, which in the last five years has sold some 17 million copies in the United States, about three million less than the Harry Potter series. In April, before its official publication, it reached No. 1 on the Amazon.com best-seller list, based on advance orders.\n\nOn the Times fiction best-seller list, it is displacing ''Easy Prey,'' a detective novel by John Sandford. The authors of ''The Indwelling,'' who say they have so far made $10 million each from the series, are on a 10-city tour, and their stop in this college town this weekend had all the panoply of a revival meeting. They attracted 900 people who paid $12 to $25 each to hear them talk about the book in a Wheaton College auditorium.\n\nMr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins were accompanied by a retinue of 17, including a blind singer, Ginny Owens, and a singer-guitarist, Wayne Watson, who played with a throbbing rock sound as the authors sat on thronelike black leather chairs bathed in cyclamen-colored lights. Two huge candelabra lent the scene a ''Phantom of the Opera'' ambience as they took questions from a rapt audience.\n\nThe latest book combines traditional elements of science fiction with the authors' unorthodox interpretation of the Book of Revelation to create a Rambo-style potboiler with a strong conservative ethos and noticeably contemporary characters who drive Range Rovers, use the Internet and have everyday worries.\n\nThe star of the series is Rayford Steele, a married commercial airline pilot who in an early scene in the first book flirts with a stewardess and minutes later discovers that more than 100 of his passengers have disappeared in midflight. As it turns out, his devout wife and son have vanished, too. All of them have, in evangelical parlance, ''accepted Christ'' and have been summoned by Jesus to the Rapture, a precursor to the Apocalypse.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
