        "text": "Author, longtime friend and donor of Liberty dies at the age of 90\n\nTimothy Francis LaHaye, 90, died July 25, 2016 at the San Diego Hospital in California a few days after suffering a heart attack.\n\nSurrounded by family, LaHaye passed away peacefully, leaving behind a legacy of ministry and generosity that will forever leave a mark on the Christian world.\n\nPerhaps best known as an award-winning author, LaHaye played an influential part in co-authoring the “Left Behind” books.\n\nChristianity Today notes that co-author Jerry B. Jenkins wrote the apocalyptic-themed novels from LaHaye’s notes.\n\nAlmost overnight, the 16-volume series became a worldwide sensation, and over 84 million copies have been sold to date.\n\n“His biggest accomplishment by far was the ‘Left Behind’ series,” Liberty University co-founder Elmer Towns said.\n\n“Tim created these books during an era when the pre-tribulation rapture was a very big idea, and because of that, their success was unprecedented.”\n\nLaHaye also wrote more than 50 nonfiction books on subjects like family life, marriage, Christian life and prophecy. These books were pivotal in his ministry and still continue to serve as a guide for many individuals and churches today.\n\nNonetheless, LaHaye’s impact spreads far beyond the world of print. For a large majority of his later life, he traveled and spoke at various churches, becoming a well-known minister in the evangelical world. LaHaye served as an influential pastor at multiple churches before settling at the Scott Memorial Baptist Church in San Diego, California for 25 years.\n\nLaHaye, along with his wife Beverly, was also involved in politics. He joined with Jerry Falwell Sr. and the Moral Majority to promote conservative values in politics and schools. LaHaye formed many close ties with Falwell during this time and built a strong relationship with the school.\n\nNot only did he and his wife donate more than $4 million to the LaHaye Student Union he also founded the Tim LaHaye School of Prophecy, a Liberty affiliate school, and served as its president for many years. Additionally, LaHaye gave money to the construction of the LaHaye Ice Center, which is named in his honor.\n\nLiberty Flames Division I Hockey Head Coach Kirk Handy notes that the LaHaye’s generosity toward the school has never gone unnoticed.\n\n“Without him and his wife, I doubt that we’d have an ice rink on campus today,” Handy said. “We have a lot to be thankful for, not only for his donation, but also for making that commitment to Liberty and the hockey program.”\n\nLaHaye’s dedication was also evident in his relationships with others. He spent a great deal of time investing in his colleagues, family and friends.\n\n“He was just another friend and another great pastor,” Towns said. “I’ve known him for years, so I felt very privileged to be able to fly out to his funeral and represent Liberty University, as we are all very grateful for his contributions to our school.”\n\nEarlier this summer, the LaHayes celebrated 69 years of marriage. LaHaye is survived by his wife, four children, nine grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren."
