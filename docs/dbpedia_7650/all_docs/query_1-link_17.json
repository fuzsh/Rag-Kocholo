        "text": "SO remember how I'm always complaining about how I have the crappiest computer ever and how I desperately need a new one? Guess who is typing this review on a MacBook Air?? (Seriously if you guess anyone but me I may question your sanity) I finally got enough money to buy it :D. (LOOKING FOR LUX PART? SCROLL TO BOTTOM OF REVIEW)\n\nThese books were good, if you looked at my goodreads you would see I rated all of them 4/5 stars except Sentinel which got 5/5 stars.\n\nSo I would rate Deity a 8/10 stars. It was a really fun read, just not my favorite. Apollyon 7/10 I took off a star because Alex was kind of annoying me in that book and Sentinel 9/10 I loved that one. Then the side books, Daimon a 7/10 I read this after I finished the series so it didn't pique my interest much especially since I was still flipping out over the end of Sentinel. And Elixir 7.7/10 it was nice having it from Aiden's POV though, well I get to it later. So if you have no idea what I'm talking about and you're looking for a fun read, I'd suggest reading Halfblood by Jennifer L. Armentrout and Obsidian by Jennifer L. Armentrout because they are very fun reads. Personally I prefer the Lux series to the Covenant Series but that doesn't mean I don't love this series as well. If you want to know my thoughts on Halfblood as well as the story summary click here.\n\nThese books- admirably sometimes I needed to take a short break from reading them, then going back to it. Let's face it, it is very, very hard to find a protagonist that everybody likes everything about, if not impossible. From pretty much all of my favorite books the protagonist has annoying qualities that just bother me. Like\n\nClary Fray: She thinks she's helping when she's just messing stuff up more and she seems to always need protecting even though she claims she doesn't\n\nKaty Swartz: She does stupid things without thinking about what will happen afterwards, we all do some of those, but some of her stunts have some pretty big consequences\n\nTris Prior: She's not exactly funny and she is always doing things to protect other people-which is good- but sometimes it's just stupid and not helping anyone\n\nKatniss Everdeen- I get where she is coming from and all but in Mockingjay she just pissed me off\n\nFour/John Smith- He's too serious, I know he's the leader and all but maybe he should loosen up a little\n\nTessa Gray- She's impulsive, which I like, but sometimes, like Clary and Tris, she just jumps into things without fully giving it full consideration\n\nSutter Keely- he PISSED me off at the end of the Spectacular Now read my review here\n\netc.\n\nSo Alex, just STOP-\n\nI like her most of the time but sometimes she just does things that got me annoyed.\n\nSo go read these books then come back and we can compare thoughts :D\n\nSpoilers below for Deity\n\nHER DAD IS ALIVE, I knew that servant had a purpose otherwise Jen would have never mentioned him. I never thought he was her dad though, that thought never popped into my mind. AND he's a half-blood so that's how an Apollyon is made.\n\nI felt like she wasn't exactly being fair to Seth, kinda trying things out with him when her heart truly belongs to Aiden. It's been obvious throughout all the books that she is going to choose Aiden because, in EVERY single book I've read they chooses the first one they truly love.\n\nIt was also obvious that Seth was hiding something, oh yeah, and that he beat the crap out of Jackson.\n\nI'm sorry, but did anyone else LOVE it when Seth and Aiden fought? I love love triangles, they're my favorite type of love thing in a book, well, as long as they choose the right person (CASHA).\n\nSo I thought Jackson was probably compelled, which he was most likely, but not by who I thought. As soon as Alex told Seth who did that to her I knew Seth was going to seriously maim Jackson.\n\nIt was cute when Aiden told Alex his fear, I was just like adisjfdguorwbg it was such a cute moment. Then he left and Luke came in. Let's just think about this for a moment, he knew who Alex was by feeling her boobs. I was practically on the floor in fits of laughter.\n\nThen Luke told her like she wasn't alone and her friends missed her and I went from laughter to awwwwww pretty quickly. So Lea is changing for the better, so anyone who has read the Lux series, does that remind you of any other bitchy character that Jenn has written about? A certain blonde? So right when I heard that I was like LEA IS GOING TO DIE.\n\n'I told him to bite me' I still love Seth even after everything. Just think about him before he was like.. changed.\n\nDeacon is gay, I was surprised at that, but I think him and Luke are cute together. Then Aiden and Seth are fighting again, Apollyon vs. Pure. Let's admit here if they were fighting to the death Seth would most likely win as of the fact that he's the Apollyon.\n\nSo.... Seth felt bad about the fight, and the obvious fact showing that is... (que drum roll) He knocked. It's a miracle!\n\nWhen Seth left with Lucian I was immediately suspicious. Was Seth compelling him? And he was looking at the two of them with a satisfied smile....\n\nHere's a note I wrote\n\nTelly -_-\n\nHate that guy\n\nAnd yes! I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE Telly even after his somewhat painful death.\n\nIt's so obvious that Marcus cares for Alex, I hate how she does't notice that.\n\n'I held the cell phone two feet from my head' Seth has the right to yell since Telly is a mundane pansy cake bitch.\n\nDO NOT TURN YOURSELF IN Alex, that was stupid, Telly obviously didn't know who compelled who otherwise he would have used it against her already.\n\nShe's dead... what???? lol I was so confused. But then she saw Caleb and I felt THE FEELS right there. OMG that part tho. I love Caleb so seeing him again :*) crying with happiness (not really but concentrate on that feeling)\n\n'You're like the sister I never wanted' isn't that just heart touching line? lol. I still love Caleb, I like that in these books since they're based off mythology that after death you can still see the people.\n\nWhen she returned to the living and didn't remember Caleb I was internally wailing.\n\nI thought Leon was weird from the start but I did not think he was Apollo that was a bit of a shock.\n\n'Slaughtering him in his sleep- you know, same old family drama. i'm sure we all relate to that. lol.\n\nGods were overgrown children, haha.\n\nValentines Eve, I LOVE Deacon he's so cute. And his MHT lol.\n\nI knew having Aiden and Alex in the same house together was bad, well not really bad but something was going to happen between the two of them.\n\nAiden admitted he was jealous of Seth, that was a SHOCKER hmm? lol not.\n\nI felt so bad for Aiden during his story of his parent's death. Personally I'd choose Seth, because Aiden is too serious for me and he acts as if the whole world is his responsibility, but I can see why Alex chose him, I just wouldn't.\n\nI want a piece of you always. No matter what. *Que feels*\n\nSeth kinda turned insane in this book. and I KNEW Lucian had a game I just was not expecting that to be it.\n\nI really wanted them to save Seth, it was obvious that he needs it so TRYYYYYYYY he is a good person! Like you can see a part of him is confused, that he can be saved. SO FREAKING ASS SAVE HIM ALREADY.\n\nI felt really bad for Lea, since she'd lost everyone. It was cute when Dawn stood up and said she loved her half-blood sister. But then Seth killed her so....\n\nI actually thought Seth had killed Apollo when Apollo stayed back to fight because of what Artemis said, but no, which is good since I like Apollo.\n\nMarcus punched Aiden in the face *Insert laugh/crying face emoji*\n\nCan you guys stop saying spawn?\n\nAnd I think he's like the father. LOL.\n\nSpoilers for Elixir\n\nHe'd hit her with a god bolt. And I'd punched him. I laughed at that line. Just the way I read it I guess like it's so simple, I punched Apollo.\n\nI liked this short 80 page story, especially since it's from Aiden's POV. Though Alex annoyed the hell out of me. First she's a bitchy evil Alex and then she's a very embarrassing Alex who hides in a closet. Is it weird that I feel embarrassed for the protagonist some times, like I feel their embarrassment? The closest part was some of it.\n\nSaint Delphi my ass. lol\n\nmy favorite part might have been him telling Alex about the first time he saw her. That was adorable.\n\nSpoilers for Apollyon\n\nI STILL LOVED SETH in this book. I was comparing fantoms left and right\n\nI thought Evil Alex was like Emotionless Elene, oh add Elena Gilbert to my list of annoying protagonists that girl... UGH I just want to punch her in the face... though Damon would most likely murder me. Emotionless Elena was just even more of a bitch than regular Elena. Okay back to the books.\n\nThen I was thinking Seth IS REALLY like Jace, because JAce turned Evil for COLS BUT HE CAME BACK so I was like SETH WILL COME BACK TO US!!!!!!!!!!! Though Seth was like 99% Jace and 1% Sebby because he was like You belong to me. I was like whoa there Sebby leave Seth. Now.\n\nI loved seeing Caleb again, how he visited her as a ghost? That was so cute.\n\nOlivia let her out. Nice. Though now the less annoying Elena/Alex is back!\n\nThey say Okay. Okay. TFIOS-ING IT UP HERE!!!! lol\n\nI liked Apollo in this book a lot more than the passed books even though I still liked him in the past books too.\n\nJust throughout my notes there are random places where I wrote stuff along the lines of DO NOT GIVE UP ON SETH\n\nIf you could not tell from my past 4 reviews I FLIPPING LOVE SETH.\n\nGross- I guessed her dad's tongue was cut out but it's still gross.\n\nAlex is so blind to the fact that Marcus loves her like a daughter and as I've said before that annoyed the hell out of me. MT. Saint Helen's causing trouble again? Those Dam Demigods! (PJO anyone?)\n\nLea and Alex have a cute friendship. It's funny was Lea reading the LUX SERIES in this book? I'm fairly sure she was. Nice one Jen.\n\nAiden has a large temper when he actually let's it out, but I liked seeing that because it makes him seem more human... well... he's not human....\n\nI was afraid a god had compelled Aiden since he kept like sneaking out, good thing he wasn't.\n\nOkay so I kept thinking back to the whole 'DO NOT TRUST THE GIfTS' from the oracle so when Apollo gave her the necklace I was like ALERT ALERT but apparently it was just Seth's gift of Telly.\n\nDid it ever mention what Marcs's element is? 'cause if so I did not catch that part. I assume it's air because it says the element choice runs in the family and Rachelle was air.\n\n'I actually felt somewhat bad about stealing his helmet and melting it down' Apollo... lol\n\nI love that even though Caleb is dead he has a small part in all the books. Thank you Jen.\n\nI hated it when she 'saw' her mom and Aiden 'saw' his parents that was so sad. He's concerned he's going to hurt Alex ahh.\n\nI actually wrote 'Poor Seth :(' I did feel really bad for him and still do.\n\nMen. Sigh. I agree Alex, I agree.\n\nHe was doing his hardest to keep his eyes north lol good Aiden.\n\nI will haunt your ass until you die. CALEB!!! <3 If you didn't know I always wanted a protective older brother and I wouldn't mind having a protective best friend, though sadly it's me that's the protective best friend in my friendships.\n\nIf I wasn't dead already I'd feel a tad bit suicidal. lol.\n\nIT WAS FLIPPING ARES. That beating sounded painful. Ouchie.\n\nBut it was really cute that she got to see her mom. <3 If my mom died I would love to get to talk to her.\n\nSentinel Spoilers below\n\nLol Artemis, have you ever heard of kiss don't tell? Poor Apollo, being tied to a rock..\n\nSo when Artemis said she had something inside her I was like WHAT DID ARES PUT IN HER?! But of course Aiden and Alex think she's pregnant. BUT I WAS RIGHT BWAHAHAHA.\n\nI'm going to say, WE FINALLY HAVE A FEMALE PROTAGONIST WHO GETS HER PERIOD. Let's just leave it at that.\n\nOlivia and Alex's friendship is so cute, I loved when she did her hair.\n\nSeth finally showed up :) I knew he was good wen he showed up, he had to be since we all know how much I flipping love Seth. It was ADORABLE how he fed her his energy after Ares beat the living hell out of her. Then when he said he felt bad adwilwrhsdoighrnw\n\nI was celebrating Lucian's death, though Seth really needs to learn that EVIL PEOPLE ARE NOT A GOOD GIFT!!!\n\nI was just like forgive Seth already. I know he did a lot of bad things but he's SETH. Sorry, I get character-ist. Very attached to Seth though.\n\nWhen she went down to see Seth and talked to him, telling him she loved him? AWWWW that's all I can say. But then Aiden got jealous -_-\n\n\"You really like pointing that at me.\"\n\n\"You have no idea how much joy it gives me.\"\n\nlol Seth and Aiden.\n\nSeth looked like he wanted to shove a dagger through his eye.\n\nHe was edging towards me, or the door or whatever the quote was, all my high lights got deleted for some reason -_-\n\nAthena, please meet the uh... Army of Awesome lol.\n\nApollo is always popping in at the best times, don't you agree?\n\nI was pretty ticked off that Aiden promised his soul to Hades.\n\nThe fundamental L's of life. *laughing*\n\nThe Slumber Party once a week idea was so cute.\n\nMarcus being the head minister is a very good idea.\n\nI WANT EVERYONE TO STOP BEING MEAN TO SETH. NOW. (Nepotism much? lol sorry)\n\nWhen Olivia died I was like ARE YOU FLIPPING KIDDING ME? Well at least she's with Caleb\n\nI liked that Alex got to talk to her dad, though he wasn't actually a very big part.\n\nYES! THE GODS CAME TO FIGHT!\n\nI knew Seth wouldn't fail her. I knew he'd give up his power. Though, lol, I always knew you were whipped Seth, sorry but I enjoyed that line for some reason. Seth flipped him off. I enjoyed that line even more.\n\nI can't breathe\n\nNeither can I, you're squashing me.\n\nSETHHHHH <3\n\nI was never scared Seth would die because I read the summery for The Return (Titan #1)\n\nWhen Seth stepping between Alex and the gods I actually almost cried because of how much he love and cared for her. Then when he promised to take care of Aiden imaginary tears were streaming down my face.\n\n\"You'll never be alone, angel. I promise you. You'll never-\"\n\nIf that line didn't give you several tons of the feels I have no idea what is wrong with your feels, you should probably go see a doctor.\n\nHearing what Aiden did when he found out she was dead... awww. But she's a demigod and so is Aiden.\n\nBUT SETH! What he did for her! I'm still so cuted out about that. This just proves my point about why I love Seth.\n\nthis was my last note\n\nTHAT IS NOT THE END!!!\n\nSETHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI cannot wait until 2015 for Seth's story. I'm glad he finds himself love.\n\n<3\n\nDaimon Spoilers\n\nSo I did't write notes but I liked this story, reading the beginning of Halfblood meant a lot more sense after reading this. That's really all I have to say about it.\n\nEND OF SPOILERS SECTION\n\nSo the series is... over. Remember how I mentioned Seth had his own series coming out in 2015?
