        "text": "I have recently (about 4 months ago I guess) started to read Jennifer L. Armentrout – finally! Why it had taken me so long to finally read something she wrote? No idea, because in a matter of minutes (it was literally minutes during the read that is the Covenant series prequel Daimon!) I learned to love that woman.\n\nShe writes awesome characters, that are neither too perfect nor too complicated to be true. Seriously, I haven’t read about that well written characters in quite a while. And that is saying something because I really love authors that write good characters. That is something I consider an absolute must-have (to seriously be on the way to love an author).\n\nBasically, the whole series has a few similarities to other Paranormal Fiction – I’m not calling this a true YA book, but it’s close – like Vampire Academy (because of the whole Covenant thing, it is literally an academy plus a city) or Starcrossed (because of the greek mythology) or even Twilight (because of the love triangle) BUT I think it is better than all the above.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love VA but the series had good books and boring filler books (in my opinion) and that is something that the Covenant Series didn’t. I do love Starcrossed too, I think it’s a very good read but again, not all three books had me enveloped so deeply. And don’t get me started on Twilight. Yes, I read it. Yes, I loved it at the time and yes, I was obsessing over it. But truth be told, I wouldn’t reread the whole saga. Just the one book: Twilight.\n\nWith the Covenant series I could imagine rereading all of them.\n\nAnd look at the beautiful covers:\n\nTo give you an idea of what this series is like, please read the back of Daimon:\n\nFor three years, Alexandria has lived among mortals—pretending to be like them and trying to forget the duty she’d been trained to fiulfll as a child of a mortal and a demigod. At seventeen, she’s pretty much accepted that she’s a freak by mortal standards… and that she’ll never be prepared for that duty.\n\nAccording to her mother, that’s a good thing.\n\nBut as every descendant of the gods knows, Fate has a way of rearing her ugly head. A horrifying attack forces Alex to flee Miami and try to find her way back to the very place her mother had warned her she should never return—the Covenant. Every step that brings her closer to safety is one more step toward death… because she’s being hunted by the very creatures she’d once trained to kill.\n\nThe daimons have found her.\n\nIf you wanna know more about how much I liked some of the books, read my review of Daimon here or go over to read my review of Half-Blood (Covenant #1) here.\n\nAnd believe me when I say… this series is gonna take you on a rollercoaster ride extraordinaire. (Thank you, J. L. Armentrout, no really, THANK YOU! *virtually hands over flowers and chocolate*)\n\nLaughing and crying with Alex? Check.\n\nFalling in love with Aiden? Check.\n\nKinda falling in love with Seth? Check.\n\nBeing torn between loving Aiden and loving Seth? Check.\n\nRooting for different sides because they have hot guys? Check.\n\nWanting to fight alongside Alex? Check.\n\nFeeling guilty for loving Seth? Check.\n\nTotally loving the description of the greek gods in this series? Double-Check.\n\nBooks in this series are:"
