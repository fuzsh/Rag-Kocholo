I'm Terry Gross.\n\nThe best-selling novel of 2001, \"Desecration,\" is the ninth in a series of\n\nnovels about the apocalypse and the second coming of Christ. The 10th, \"The\n\nRemnant,\" was a best seller this year. More than 50 million copies of these\n\nnovels have been sold. They're known as the \"Left Behind\" series, named after\n\nthe title of the first book, which told the story of the rapture, where\n\nmillions of born-again Christians are instantly raised into heaven. The\n\nnon-believers are left behind on Earth to face seven years of tribulation,\n\nwars, plagues and other catastrophes until the final battle between Jesus and\n\nthe Antichrist. In these books, the Antichrist is the former head of the\n\nUnited Nations.\n\nThe authors are Jerry Jenkins and my guest, Tim LaHaye. LaHaye is a longtime\n\nleader of the Christian right. He was a co-founder of the Moral Majority. In\n\n1987 he briefly served as co-chair of Republican Jack Kemp's presidential\n\ncampaign. LaHaye also co-founded the Council for National Policy, a secretive\n\ngroup whose members are described by abcNEWS.com as among the brightest lights\n\nof the hard right. Their guest speakers have included Clarence Thomas and\n\nGeorge W. Bush. Tim LaHaye has a new self-help book in which he offers his\n\nadvice on how to face the end times. I asked him what he thinks are the signs\n\nthat the end is near.\n\nMr. TIM LaHAYE (Author): First of all, Israel being brought back into the\n\nland. All prophecy scholars teach that the phenomenon of our age is Israel\n\ncoming back into the land, when they didn't have a homeland for 1,700 years.\n\nNo nation in the history of the world has ever been able to succeed having\n\nbeen disrupted from their homeland and maintained existence for over three or\n\n500 years, except the Jews. And the interesting thing is God's word many\n\ntimes predicted that the Jews would be taken back into the land, and it always\n\nmeans the Holy Land, and so that's one. That's the supersign.\n\nThen another sign is people will run to and fro on the Earth and knowledge be\n\nincreased. And then after that there are a number of others, the decadence of\n\nour society and the movement toward a one-world government. We hear so much\n\ntoday from many kinds of people talking about the panacea to man's problems\n\nbeing a one-world government. And it's true, there have been an enormous\n\nnumber of wars in human history, particularly in the last century, and so man\n\nnaturally thinks if he's going to solve these problems by himself without aid\n\nfrom God, then it makes sense to have a one-world government. What they\n\nforget is that then you have a man running the government, and absolute power\n\ncorrupts absolutely. So it can be dangerous. But anyway, we're moving in\n\nthat direction just as the Bible said.\n\nGROSS: Tim LaHaye, I'm gonna ask you to describe your understanding of the\n\nend of days. What happens at the end?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, the Bible is very clear. If you take it literally, it's\n\nvery clear about the events in the last days. The next major event on the\n\nprophetic calendar is what we call the rapture of the church, when Christ\n\nshouts from heaven and all the dead in Christ for 2,000 years--there'd be\n\nbillions of people who have called on the name of the Lord as their Lord and\n\nsavior--they'll be resurrected. And then which we are alive, all believers on\n\nthe Earth today, and only God knows how many--I hope it's maybe one or two\n\nbillion people that have received Christ while they're alive--and they will be\n\ntransformed, and we meet in the air. Then we meet in the clouds and then we\n\nmeet the Lord in the air, and then we'll ever be with the Lord. And so the\n\nbelievers have one scenario when they go up to heaven to be with him in\n\nfulfillment of Jesus' promise that, `I go to my father's house and I will come\n\nagain and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also.'\n\nSo we have a certainty that we will go to the father's house.\n\nBut then--and this is what the book of Revelation covers and what we cover\n\nmostly in our fiction series, \"Left Behind,\" is the events that will happen\n\nhere on Earth. And they're detailed in the book of Revelation, and you'll\n\nfind the time of wrath, the wrath of God on those who reject him and follow\n\nthe forces of evil.\n\nGROSS: And what are some scenarios we might expect during that period of the\n\nwrath of God?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, the first thing that will happen will be the sealed\n\njudgments. There are seven of those. And then after that there are trumpet\n\njudgments and after that there are vile. So there are 21 judgments in all.\n\nAnd the sealed judgments start with the rider on the white horse. The\n\nAntichrist comes in and with diplomacy and cunning and so on, he gains control\n\nof the world. And then by offering peace, says we'll have world peace, and\n\neverybody today wants world peace, but the Bible says the next horseman--and\n\nthis is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the first four seals--and\n\nthe second one is war and bloodshed. And then you have famine and so on.\n\nWell, during that last seven years of tribulation, they have to make a\n\ndecision: Are they going to become believers or are they going to become\n\nfollowers of Antichrist, who is really led by Satan himself? And so it's a\n\nmatter of God or Satan.\n\nGROSS: So first comes the rapture in which the believers rise to heaven, and\n\nthen comes the seven-year period of the tribulation which is filled with war\n\nand plague and famine and all that stuff. And the people experiencing that\n\nare the non-believers, the people who have been left behind on Earth. And how\n\ndoes that end?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, that ends by Christ finishing his coming. See, the\n\nrapture, he comes in the air, but seven years later he comes to the Earth and\n\nhe conquers the Antichrist's armies as they're gathered in Armageddon, and\n\nthen he sets up his kingdom, and then you have what everybody craves for,\n\npeace on Earth, goodwill toward men, and you have the government of Christ.\n\nIt's a time of righteousness, a time of justice, and a time of blessing, and\n\nit lasts for a thousand years.\n\nGROSS: So the creation of Israel is, in your mind, a sign that the end is\n\nnear. Now what happens to the Jewish people in your vision of the end of\n\ndays?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: They're going to go back into the promised land, and they're\n\ngoing to rebuild their temple and they're going to set up their temple\n\nworship. You know, it's been 2,000 years almost that they've had no worship;\n\never since 70 AD when the temple was destroyed, they've had no sacrifice. And\n\nso they will return to that. But during that time, there will be an\n\noutpouring of the Holy Spirit and the moving of many people's hearts to come\n\nto God. And the people that reject God will be those who just rebel against\n\nGod. They're opposed to anything spiritual, and they deny the existence of\n\nGod. And people with that attitude are quick to follow something that's\n\nspurious, and during the tribulation period Antichrist will come along and\n\nfill that vacuum and lead the people to follow him. And he really is\n\nfollowing Satan and doing Satan's work. It's a classic illustration of the\n\nlast days battle between good and evil. The last days--actually I call it the\n\nlong war between God and Satan for the souls of men...\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nMr. LaHAYE: ...and it will reach its vortex during that period.\n\nGROSS: So let me see if I understand correctly. The re-establishment of\n\nIsrael is important in your understanding...\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...of the end of days, but what about the Jewish people? Are they\n\nconsidered believers when the rapture comes or non-believers?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: That's an individual experience. Anyone can become a believer\n\nfrom any religion, any ethnic group, and the Jews are no exception. About a\n\nthird of them, according to Zechariah, will become believers...\n\nGROSS: Believers in Christ, is what you mean.\n\nMr. LaHAYE: ...before the end--exactly. A massive number of them will\n\nreceive Christ as their Messiah.\n\nGROSS: So although the establishment of Israel is important in your vision of\n\nthe second coming, Jews themselves will have to convert to Christianity in\n\norder to be saved, and those who don't will be condemned to suffer here on\n\nEarth during the tribulations and then basically to go to hell if they haven't\n\nconverted after that?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: That's a good summary of what's going to happen. Just because\n\nyou're a Jew does not mean that you don't have to make the same decision that\n\neveryone else does. The Bible refers to men all encompassing in the words,\n\n`Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved,' and so he\n\ndoesn't discriminate between Jews or Gentiles. It's God's will that all men\n\nbe saved and receive Jesus as their Messiah.\n\nGROSS: Now what about Catholics? Do they have to--I mean, does everybody who\n\nis of the Christian faith get saved or, I mean, do they have to follow a\n\ncertain type of Christian faith? Will Catholics be saved? Do they have to\n\nconvert to a more born-again type of faith?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, we believe that when Jesus said twice in John 3, that\n\n`Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of heaven,' that that's\n\na mandatory requirement for salvation. You have to be born again. But\n\nsomewhere--and it's not defined exactly how you do it. I think sometimes\n\nwe're a little more specific because of our tradition. I'm convinced that\n\nthere are many people who have, from their ignorance, recognizing that Christ\n\ndied for their sins and that he rose again, they've called out to God in the\n\nname of Christ for mercy. They don't know exactly how to pray, but you see,\n\nGod looks on the heart, and that's the neat thing about it is that a man looks\n\non the outward appearance, the Bible says, but God looks on the heart. And so\n\nwhen he looks into the heart and sees that person call on the name of the Lord\n\nto be saved, then he's saved. Doesn't matter whether he's a Baptist or a\n\nCatholic or a Presbyterian or whatever.\n\nGROSS: Your series of novels, \"Left Behind,\" that's based on biblical\n\nprophecy of the apocalypse, the second coming of Christ, the rapture, the end\n\nof days, these series of books has sold over 50 million copies. Would you\n\nlike your readers who aren't born-again Christians to convert?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, I must say that that's the primary purpose of our writing\n\nis to communicate the grace of God and the mercy of God to individuals, and\n\nextending them salvation, and then show it in real-life characters, that\n\npeople that are born again or people that call on the name of the Lord are\n\njust ordinary people, like an airlines pilot, the hero of our series, Rayford\n\nSteele. After the rapture, he prays to receive Christ, and then his daughter\n\nfinally does, and then the journalists--so that people from all walks of life\n\nare doing what we call having a believable conversion. And we try to write it\n\ndown to earth and reasonably believable. And that it's the kind of prayer\n\nthat another person can pray. I think that the success we've had is\n\nattributed to Jerry's personal writing and the incredible story that God has\n\noutlined for the future.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Tim LaHaye, co-author of the apocalyptic Christian novels\n\nknown as the \"Left Behind\" series. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest, Tim LaHaye, is the co-author of the best-selling Christian\n\nnovels about the apocalypse and the second coming known as the \"Left Behind\"\n\nseries. He was on the board of the Moral Majority.\n\nIn imagining what the second coming will be like, you have to imagine the\n\nfinal battle between Christ and the Antichrist. Is there anyone now on Earth\n\nwho you suspect of being the Antichrist?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: No, I don't. I can't imagine who it would be, and I'll be honest\n\nwith you, I have looked. And among Bible scholars, though there's very little\n\ndisagreement about the fact that Christ is going to come to the Earth, there\n\nare many people that have tried to pinpoint. I have not been that\n\nspeculative. I think that brings the whole cause of prophecy into disrepute\n\nwhen someone turns out not to be the Antichrist. But I wouldn't be at all\n\nsurprised if he's in the world today.\n\nGROSS: One of the chief villains in your \"Left Behind\" series is Nicolae\n\nJetty Carpathia, who's the former president of Romania, former\n\nsecretary-general of the United Nations, and now the head of the global\n\ncommunity. What does his casting as the villain indicate about your views of\n\nthe United Nations?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, the United Nations is just an easy fall guy for the fact\n\nthat the Bible has taught for many years that there would be a one-world\n\ngovernment set up, and it's not just the United Nations. But the thinking of\n\nmankind ever since World War I when you have the devastation of all but seven\n\ncountries of the world involved in the conflagration, and millions of people\n\ndying, both because of the war and then as an aftermath, they were back then\n\ntrying to get a one-world government established to solve the problems of man.\n\nAnd it wasn't until 1945 that the United Nations was set up, and here we are\n\n50 years later and it's the closest thing that exists to world government.\n\nAnd so it just happens to be the fall guy of what we think the Bible predicts.\n\nThere will be a one-world government. It may not be the United Nations.\n\nGROSS: We are living in an age of nuclear weapons, and now, you know, the\n\nWhite House fears that Saddam Hussein is close to building a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt looks like North Korea has a nuclear weapon. How does this come into play\n\nin your vision of the end of days? Is this a sign, do you think, that we're\n\ngetting close?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, yes, it certainly is an indication that we're living in\n\nperilous, insecure times, and it is interesting that it focuses on the Middle\n\nEast. See, the Bible makes it clear that Jerusalem and Israel and the Middle\n\nEast will be the focal point of the world's interest factor, and in my\n\nlifetime that's--at least my professional lifetime--that's been a main focus,\n\nbecause the Bible predicted that the end times would focus on the Middle East.\n\nAnd the thing that's drawing them, of course, is oil. What we're seeing here\n\nis a not-so-subtle attempt to control the world's oil, because who controls\n\nthe oil controls the world.\n\nGROSS: You know, you were talking about how important the Middle East is in\n\npreparing for the end of days. And I'm wondering is that for instance why Pat\n\nRobertson, on the newscasts on his show, has always devoted so much time to\n\ncoverage of the Middle East?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Could very well be, because that's a focal point of prophetic\n\ninterest. And the interesting thing is that the Bible says that in the last\n\ndays in Israel would be a troublesome stone, and that's exactly what they are.\n\nThey're a trouble to the whole world. I'm not saying they shouldn't do what\n\nthey're doing, but it's causing great trouble in the whole world...\n\nGROSS: How--I'm sorry.\n\nMr. LaHAYE: ...because of the animosities of--you have the Islamic peoples\n\nagainst the Jews. It goes back centuries, and it's culminating in our own\n\nday.\n\nGROSS: Tim LaHaye, your best-selling series of \"Left Behind\" novels, about\n\nthe rapture and the Antichrist, the Second Coming, the apocalypse--these have\n\nreally struck a chord--I mean, 50 million copies sold. In these books, a lot\n\nof people convert and become born-again Christians and go to heaven. Are you\n\nconfident that you're going to heaven?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Oh, yes. I have every confidence because the Bible says if we\n\nwould call on the name of the Lord, we would be saved, and I've called on the\n\nname of the Lord. I had a very distinct experience when I was very young, and\n\nI've never had any question. Not based on any goodness in me. I know I have\n\nnot lived a perfect life, and I'm not perfect now. But I am a forgiven\n\nbeliever just like anyone who believes that Jesus died for their sins and rose\n\nagain can have forgiveness. So I have no question about being saved.\n\nAnd I don't mind telling you I think that there are probably a billion or more\n\nof us in this world, that when Jesus shouts from heaven, we're all going.\n\nGROSS: The rapture takes place during your series of novel, and that's when\n\npeople who are believers get just instantaneously lifted into heaven. And in\n\nyour novels, suddenly, their kind of personal effects are left behind, but the\n\npeople have disappeared, you know, leaving behind, like, earrings or clothing\n\nor, you know, just other personal effects. Would you like to be alive during\n\nthe rapture? Do you think that it makes a difference to your soul whether you\n\ndie before the rapture or whether you're here for the actual rapture itself?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: No, it doesn't make any difference to your soul, but I'll be\n\nhonest with you, my wife and I have kiddingly said--you know, we've been\n\nmarried for 55 years. We would love to be a part of the rapture, instead of\n\neither one of us having to face death of a person we love, to go together in\n\nthe rapture. And the neat thing about it is every one of our listeners today\n\nif they would recognize that they need to receive Jesus, they could have that\n\nsame hope. The Bible makes this a blessed hope. And it's a comfort to us to\n\nknow that in the twinkling of an eye, in a moment, Jesus could shout and we\n\ncould be translated into heaven forever and ever and ever and ever.\n\nGROSS: You believe that the only true faith is born-again Christianity, and\n\nthat only...\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Yes, I do.\n\nGROSS: ...and that only born-again Christians will be redeemed and go to\n\nheaven. During this time on Earth, what is your feelings towards people of\n\nother faiths, or your feelings about people who are Christians but not\n\nborn-again Christians? Do you have respect for their faiths? Do you respect\n\nthem as Catholics or Jews or Muslims?\n\nMr. LaHAYE: Well, I respect them for what they believe. And in fact, I try\n\nto be respectful toward all people, and yet disagree with what they believe.\n\nThat should be my right in a free society. But it's my responsibility before\n\nGod to confront other people with the truth as it is in Christ. You know, a\n\nlot of people say that, `You should know the truth, and the truth will make\n\nyou free,' but what they don't--they take it out of context. The truth there\n\nis Jesus. Jesus is the truth; he is the way that God has prescribed to\n\ncome--and he says, `No man comes to the father but by him.'\n\nI'll tell you a little secret. I was in the Holy Land when they were having a\n\nreligious conclave, and who should be walking down the hall toward me with an\n\nentourage but the Dalai Lama. And I didn't know--here I am, a minister from\n\nAmerica visiting, and I just stuck out my hand and shook hands with him and\n\nsaid, `Sir, has anyone ever explained to you who Jesus Christ really is? If\n\nthey haven't, I'd be glad to spend an hour with you and just share with you\n\nthe truth about him.' And his aide, of course, brushed me off and told me\n\nthat he was busy; he didn't have time. But that was just an involuntary\n\nresponse to a man who is very religious and very pious and probably very\n\nsincere, but he doesn't know the truth of the way to God, and I think we\n\nChristians have to be ready at any moment to share that truth with them.\n\nGROSS: Well, Tim LaHaye, thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nMr. LaHAYE: It's been my privilege. God bless you.\n\nGROSS: Tim LaHaye is co-author of the \"Left Behind\" novels. His new advice\n\nbook is called \"The Merciful God of Prophecy: His Loving Plan for You in the\n\nEnd Times.\"\n\nI'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Gershom Gorenberg discusses his book, \"The End of\n\nDays: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount,\" and\n\nthe \"Left Behind\" series\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest, Gershom Gorenberg, is an Israeli journalist who writes about the\n\nintersection of politics and religion. He's the author of the book, \"The End\n\nof Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount.\" One chapter\n\nof the book is devoted to his analysis of the \"Left Behind\" series of\n\napocalyptic Christian novels co-authored by Tim LaHaye, who we just heard\n\nfrom. Gorenberg is also an associate of the Center for Millennial Studies at\n\nBoston University and has written for The Jerusalem Report and The New\n\nRepublic. I asked him how he interprets the popularity of the \"Left Behind\"\n\nseries.\n\nMr. GERSHOM GORENBERG (Author, \"The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the\n\nStruggle for the Temple Mount\"): The first thing it says is that there's a\n\ntremendous interest in Apocalypse, in the end of days, as portrayed by\n\nfundamentalist Christianity. It's not restricted to a few nuts, somebody\n\nstanding on the street corner with a sign saying, `The end is nigh.' It's a\n\npart of American culture shared by millions of people.\n\nThe second thing it says is that the books themselves are spreading that\n\nbelief, spreading that interest and, along with it, spreading a whole set of\n\nreligious and political ideas; religious ideas that are essentially\n\nfundamentalist, largely intolerant and political ideas which belong to the\n\nright fringe of American politics.\n\nGROSS: What are some of your concerns about the ideas in the series?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, the series presents a fantasy version of today's world.\n\nIn the books, the final seven years of history are taking place, but if you\n\nread carefully, what's really going on is this is our world without the\n\ndissonance felt by fundamentalist Christians. This is a world in which\n\nmiracles take place, in which all the bad things from a fundamentalist\n\nperspective are openly being done by the Antichrist. And so it provides a\n\ncertain road map of a view of today's world. It promotes the idea that there\n\nis a conspiracy of financiers behind world affairs. It promotes the idea that\n\nthat dark, satanic conspiracy has among its aims global disarmament. So the\n\nmoment you run into anything that's working for peace or international\n\ncooperation, you're supposed to identify it as associated with the Antichrist,\n\nwith Satan.\n\nThere is a portrayal of Catholicism as being partner to the Antichrist, as\n\nbeing a religion which is essentially the handmaiden of the devil, or in the\n\napocalyptic language that they would use, the whore of Babylon. So here you\n\nhave a rejection of an entire religious stream. You have a portrayal of\n\necumenicalism and interreligious dialogue as being demonic. You also have a\n\nportrayal of a situation in which the Jews are either converted or killed.\n\nGROSS: The Jewish people in Israel have a central place in the vision of\n\nApocalypse and the Second Coming of Jesus as it's described in the \"Left\n\nBehind\" series and as it's understood by the authors of this series. Let me\n\nask you to explain that place.\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, here, these books really provide a key to understanding\n\nsupport by the Christian right for Israel and what's underlying it and how,\n\nstrangely enough, there's really a very anti-Jewish theology underlying the\n\nostensible support for Israel, because in the theology that they're\n\npresenting, the Jews have to return to their land and create a state as the\n\nprelude for the Second Coming. But once the apocalyptic events begin to take\n\nplace, the Jews will either have to convert or to die. When the scenario is\n\ncompleted, when the Second Coming takes place, there will be no more Jews.\n\nGROSS: Let me explain. That means that in order for them to get to heaven,\n\nthey have to convert to born-again Christianity, and if not, they'll be\n\ncondemned to hell. At least that's how it was described a little earlier on\n\nour show by Tim LaHaye.\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Right. But if you read the books, you see something further\n\nthan that, because, again, the books are a playing out of the religious drama\n\nin the real world. So by the latest of the books, by number 10, you have a\n\nscene in which the Antichrist is ordering the slaughter of all Jews. And the\n\nonly ones who are going to get saved, clearly from what else is going on in\n\nthe book, are those who've already become Christians. So the scene that\n\nleaders are reading is one in which Jews either convert or die. That's the\n\nfantasy in the books. There won't be anymore Jews to refuse Jesus.\n\nIn a sense, what you have going on here, again, is this is the resolution of\n\nall the forms of dissonance that the fundamentalist feels about this world.\n\nAnd one of the prime places of dissonance is: How come the Jews didn't accept\n\nthe person that Christianity regards as the Messiah? After all, he was a Jew,\n\nChristianity insists that he was the Jewish Messiah. How come the Jews don't\n\naccept him? Christianity says that he was predicted in the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\nHow come the Jews, who have that book, don't accept that?\n\nSo what happens in this series of novels, they either accept it or they die.\n\nThe irony is that here you have a group of people who are emphatically\n\nprofessing their love for Israel and for the Jewish people, and yet, they're\n\nbasing that on a variation of a theology which is incredibly intolerant to\n\nJudaism.\n\nGROSS: Some leaders on the Christian right, including Pat Robertson, Jerry\n\nFalwell, have offered support for Israel. And I'm wondering if that's\n\ncontroversial in Israel since part of the Christian right believes the\n\nscenario that we've been discussing, that Israel is important because that\n\nharkens the Second Coming of Jesus, but on the other hand, Jews will have to\n\nconvert if they want to get to heaven?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: It's created growing controversy, particularly in recent days.\n\nThere's been questions about groups accepting funds from fund-raisers who\n\ntarget American fundamentalists. There's been questions about the political\n\nprogram that the American Christian right would like to promote in Israel,\n\nbecause its support for Israel is really the support for a very hard-line, far\n\nright-wing position.\n\nGROSS: What is that position?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, they regularly push the idea that Israel should not give\n\nup any land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but continue ruling those\n\nterritories forever. They say that this is land that's promised by God to the\n\nJews and, therefore, immediate, pragmatic and moral problems involved in the\n\nruling the Palestinian population are irrelevant. There have been some\n\nmembers of the Christian right who have even proposed evicting the\n\nPalestinians from the territories. Those are positions that are on the very\n\nfar right-wing fringe in Israeli terms.\n\nGROSS: When the Christian right supports Israel with funding, who does the\n\nmoney go to?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: There's been a range of programs that they've supported.\n\nThere have been some people who simply raise large sums of money for\n\nhumanitarian projects, or they're particularly interested in projects to\n\nsettle new immigrants here because they see that, the in-gathering of the Jews\n\nto their land, as fulfilling prophecy. But we've also seen the phenomenon of\n\nChristian right leaders and groups lending moral and financial support to\n\ngroups on the radical, right-wing fringe in Israel; most specifically, groups\n\nthat would like to destroy the Muslim shrines at the Temple Mount at Haram\n\nal-Sharif and replace them with the third temple, because Christian\n\nfundamentalists see that as essential for the Second Coming.\n\nSo, for instance, the leader of the Temple Mount Faithful, one such radical\n\ngroup, regularly goes to the United States and goes from fundamentalist church\n\nto fundamentalist church raising money for his group, which actually has very\n\nlittle support within Israel. And I've even heard and read statements by\n\nfigures on the Christian right who proclaim their love for Israel and, at the\n\nsame time, express understanding or even sympathy for the assassination of the\n\nlate Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. This is the equivalent of somebody telling\n\nyou that he supports the United States, and that's why he loves Timothy\n\nMcVeigh. I think most Americans would feel rather uncomfortable with somebody\n\nexpressing that kind of supposed support for the United States.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Israeli journalist Gershom Gorenberg. He's the author of\n\nthe book, \"The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple\n\nMount.\" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, one of the things we're talking about is\n\nthe best-selling series of books called the \"Left Behind\" series, and its\n\nco-author is Tim LaHaye, who joined us earlier on this program. And he is\n\nsomebody who believes that the Second Coming is near, and this series of books\n\nexpresses a fictionalized version of the events that might happen before the\n\nSecond Coming.\n\nNow some of those scenarios are based on the Book of Revelations. How much of\n\nthis scenario is based on the Bible, and how much of it is based on something\n\nmore recent than that?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: They claim that this is all based on a literal reading of the\n\nBible, and that they're not putting any of their own interpretation into it.\n\nAnd, of course, this claim is rather absurd because any construction of an\n\nunderstanding of the Bible involves human interpretation. You're talking\n\nabout an ancient text, one that's poetic, one that's ambiguous, one that's\n\noften allegorical. So when they construct this entire scenario out of the\n\nBible, it's a vast structure of interpretation in which key girders in that\n\nstructure are biblical verses. But the way that those verses are put\n\ntogether, the way that the structure is built is the responsibility of the\n\npeople creating the structure. In fact, that's one of the great moral\n\nproblems, is that they don't take responsibility for the philosophy that\n\nthey're promoting.\n\nGROSS: You also, in your book \"The End of Days,\" cite somebody named John\n\nDarby for first expressing this type of rapture scenario.\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Right. Darby was a 19th century British preacher who came up\n\nwith a new theory of the end of days, and his ideas spread very quickly among\n\nconservative Protestants in the United States and eventually became the main\n\ntheology among American fundamentalists and quite influential among the wider\n\ncommunity known as evangelicals. It's not universally accepted. The fact\n\nthat somebody is an evangelical doesn't mean that he or she accepts these\n\nideas, but they are very, very, very influential.\n\nThe thing that's interesting is that you'll find that the various prophesy\n\npreachers and scholars with their books and their videos and their cassette\n\ntapes and their radio shows rarely mention Darby, because the conceit is this\n\nis the literal meaning of the text, so you shouldn't refer back to a earlier\n\ninterpreter. That would be admitting that this is an interpretation.\n\nGROSS: How did you learn about Darby?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, I first began to look into these groups because I became\n\ninterested in their connections with far right groups in Israel. And in the\n\ncourse of reading about them, talking to scholars of Christian theology who\n\nhad studied these groups, I was pointed to various texts which explained the\n\nhistory of this movement. But as I said, when you read the popular text,\n\nthere is almost never any mention of where these ideas started, where they\n\ncame from, because they're supposed to be the literal meaning of the Bible.\n\nOne thing that's very funny about it, actually, is that oftentimes, these\n\nliteral interpretations are being offered by people who actually can't read\n\nthe original text. They're literal interpretations of a translation and, of\n\ncourse, every translation is, in itself, an interpretation. So they're taking\n\nthe English text of the Bible and building these theories upon it.\n\nGROSS: Is there a scene from the \"Left Behind\" series that you could describe\n\nto illustrate what you consider to be one of the more disturbing aspects of\n\nthis world view?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, in the 10th book of the series, which is the most recent\n\none, which is called \"The Remnant,\" there is a scene in which the character\n\nknown as Nicolae Carpathia, who is the Antichrist, the world dictator, is\n\nsitting in his office, and he calls in his top aide and he tells him to go out\n\nand order the death of all the Jews. He says, `Imprison them, torture them,\n\nhumiliate them, shame them, blaspheme their god, plunder everything they own.\n\nNothing is more important,' and the aide rushes out to do this. Now this\n\nidea, which is basically the idea of a coming holocaust, is one that you find\n\noften in the writings of fundamentalist Christians.\n\nThere's books that you can find on their Web sites with names like \"Israel's\n\nFinal Holocaust.\" I've had other fundamentalist figures tell me that what\n\nwill happen during the last years of history will be worse than what happened\n\nin Europe in the '40s. And when you question them on this, they say, `Well,\n\nwe don't want it to happen, but that's what the Bible says will happen.' But,\n\nof course, this is their interpretation of the Bible. The Bible doesn't say\n\nthis; this is how they read the Bible.\n\nGROSS: Now you cover the intersection of religion and politics in Israel.\n\nAnd in Israel, you have people from the three monotheistic faiths coming\n\nbecause the Middle East is a center for Islamic, Christian and Jewish belief.\n\nSo do you feel that Israel is a kind of flash point for apocalyptic thinking\n\nin all three monotheistic faiths?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Absolutely. The difficulty that Israel lives with is that\n\nbecause it's the Holy Land, it's also the stage upon which the apocalyptic\n\nmyths of all three religions say that the final drama is going to be played\n\nout. And that creates a situation in which anything that happens here,\n\nparticularly anything dramatic, can easily be interpreted as being part of the\n\nend. And so there are people in Israel among the Jews who see the creation of\n\nIsrael and the victory of 1967 as proof that the Messiah is coming. There are\n\nMuslims who are also certain, for different reasons, that the events of today\n\nare proof that the last days are upon us as described in Islam. And one of\n\nthe things that's not much known here but is very important is that in Islam,\n\nas well, the last events are supposed to take place in Jerusalem. As one\n\nfundamentalist shech said to me, `Islam was born in Mecca, but it will reach\n\nits conclusion in Jerusalem.' So for Muslims, as well, the real-life\n\npolitical conflict in the Holy Land can easily take on mythical proportions of\n\nthe end.\n\nGROSS: Do you think apocalyptic thinking is figuring at all into the actual\n\npeace process or the totally derailed peace process in the Middle East now?\n\nMr. GORENBERG: These kind of beliefs have played a crucial role in the Middle\n\nEast conflict for the last century and certainly in the last several years.\n\nAnd one of the failures of secular politicians and diplomats was not knowing\n\nenough about these beliefs in order to be able to deal with them better.\n\nGROSS: Give me an example of what you mean.\n\nMr. GORENBERG: Well, first of all, the existence of small, radical fringe\n\ngroups in the Israeli public who would like to destroy the Islamic shrines in\n\nJerusalem and replace them with the temple has reverberated far louder in the\n\nMuslim world to the extent that many, many Arabs are convinced that that's\n\nwhat Israel as a government is intending to do.\n\nSo at the Camp David talks, when the subject of who would have final\n\nsovereignty over the Temple Mount came up and Prime Minister Ehud Barak\n\nsuggested that it would remain under Israeli sovereignty and that there would\n\nbe a place there for Jewish worship as well, as one Palestinian pollster told\n\nme afterwards, that sounded on the Palestinian side as if, `Ah, it's true.\n\nThe Jews really want to get rid of the shrines and build the temple there.'\n\nThat wasn't at all what Barak intended, but it was an entirely predictable\n\nresponse if you know what the religious mood was.\n\nOn top of that, there was a vast literature of popular Islamic pamphlets\n\npredicting that the last days would begin in the year 2000, according to the\n\nChristian calendar, and that it would begin with a Jewish attempt to destroy\n\nAl Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. So the political events, as it were, backed up\n\nthis kind of religious paranoia and heated up the temperature greatly.\n\nGROSS: Well, Gershom Gorenberg, I want to thank you very much for talking\n\nwith us.\n\nMr. GORENBERG: It's been a pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Gershom Gorenberg is the author of \"The End of Days: Fundamentalism\n\nand the Struggle for the Temple Mount.\"\n\nComing up, Ken Tucker reviews a new CD by Peter Wolf, formerly of The J. Geils\n\nBand. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Peter Wolf's new album \"Sleepless\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nPeter Wolf is best known as the lead singer for The J. Geils Band. Since\n\nleaving the band in 1983, Wolf has put out solo albums. His new one is called\n\n\"Sleepless.\" Rock critic Ken Tucker says it's more than another veteran\n\nrocker trying to recapture past glory.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Never Like This Before\")\n\nMr. PETER WOLF: (Singing) I've been kissed, loved, squeezed and teased, but\n\nnever like this before. You got me dragging behind...\n\nKEN TUCKER reporting:\n\nThat's Peter Wolf doing a fine cover of an obscure William Bell song called\n\n\"Never Like This Before.\" It was originally cut by Bell in Memphis on the\n\ngreat soul label Stax. It sounds to me like a natural hit single, but\n\nprobably for a consortium of rock radio station that will never exist again,\n\nwhere white rockers profoundly influenced by black bluesmen get more than the\n\nfeeling of power and authenticity; they get airplay.\n\nSpeaking of those sorts of white guys, The Rolling Stones are on tour now.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe Wolf's duet with Mick Jagger on this track, \"Nothin' But\n\nthe Wheel,\" will snag Wolf some attention.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Nothin' But the Wheel\")\n\nMr. WOLF: Way on past the boulevards, out here underneath the stars. I've\n\nbeen flying past the houses, farms and fields. Leaving all I know back home;\n\nrushing through the cold night air and holding on to nothin' but the wheel.\n\nMr. MICK JAGGER and Mr. WOLF: (Singing in unison) Staying clear of the\n\ninterstate, I'm seeking out those old two lanes, trying to explain the way I\n\nfeel, till all at once it's half past three, and it's down to the trucks and\n\nme. And I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel.\n\nTUCKER: \"Nothin' But the Wheel\" is a good song. Heck, it's better than\n\nanything Mick Jagger had on his solo album earlier this year--You never heard\n\nthat one, did you? But as solid as Wolf makes his celebrity cameos work for\n\nhim--there's another one here with Steve Earle--it's when he's all alone,\n\nsinging as if it was 2 AM and no one was around to hear him speak his thoughts\n\nthat he makes his best music. That's the place where this song, \"Growin'\n\nPain,\" comes from.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Growin' Pain\")\n\nMr. WOLF: (Singing) Sometimes I don't know what it is I'm looking for.\n\nWhatever it is I want, I seem to need a little bit more. Careful what you\n\npursue. Choosing it, it chooses you, 'cause everything around here is a\n\ngrowin' pain. My old friend left...\n\nTUCKER: When I listen to that song, \"Growin' Pain,\" it summons up a whole\n\nhistory of a life. The title works as a pun about growing pains, which are\n\ngenerally perceived to be good, experiences you go through to emerge a wiser\n\nman, but there's also a sense in which Wolf means that life is an increasing,\n\ngrowing pain. It gets harder to write a song that strikes its author as\n\nmeaningful beyond its commercial possibilities. It gets harder to recapture\n\nthe enthusiasm of youth. It gets easier to see the ways in which life is\n\npassing you by. Wolf locates these ideas in another song, too, one called \"A\n\nLot of Good Ones Gone.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"A Lot of Good Ones Gone\")\n\nMr. WOLF: (Singing) If yesterday was still here today, I think I might, I\n\nmight do it all, I just might do it all another way. I feel the passin' of\n\nthe year with a teardrop. I see shadows everywhere, but I still do carry on,\n\nthough there's a lot of good ones gone.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nTUCKER: This album is filled with pain, regret, nostalgia and confusion, yet\n\nthe last thing it is is downbeat, jaded or cynical. It takes some heroism for\n\na guy on the back end of his 50s to rouse not merely the energy but the\n\nsincerity, the discipline to reject cheap irony or faked world weariness, to\n\nput out a record as satisfying as Peter Wolf has done here. His sleepless\n\nnights can be the soundtrack of many of our brightest and bleakest days.\n\nGROSS: Ken Tucker is critic at large for Entertainment Weekly. He reviewed\n\nPeter Wolf's CD \"Sleepless.\"\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.\n\n(Soundbite of song)"
