Jenkins\n\nISBN: 0-8423-5745-9\n\nPublisher: Tyndale House Publishers\n\nPub. Date: September, 2001\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nVolumes: 4\n\nList Price(USD): $55.96\n\nYour CountryCurrencyDelivery Include Used Books Are you a club member of: Barnes and Noble\n\nBooks A Million Chapters.Indigo.ca\n\nAverage Customer Rating: 3.61 (95 reviews)\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nRating: 2\n\nSummary: Dogma for Born-Again Christians Only\n\nComment: When I read the initial reviews & write-ups, I purchsed these 1st 4 books because the plot seemed intriguing. And they certainly could have been a good set if it weren't for the horrendously bad writing and over-the-top proselytizing.\n\n1st: The dialog is so badly written that you can't tell which character is speaking without continously searching for the \"Chloe said\" or \"Buck said\". Each character speaks exactly like every other character and none of them resemble realistic spoken language.\n\n2nd: The situations are distractingly unrealistic--WWIII is underway, yet car salesman continue to sell cars and store clerks continue to sell cell phones like normal, just so these True Christian characters can purchase them rather than take what doesn't belong to them, even in the midst of world chaos and devastation. Then there's the idea that the college student and the world-traveling, internationally acclaimed journalist are both virgins.....\n\n3rd: The authors' opinions tainting every page. Catholics are evil. All people who haven't said \"the prayer\" proclaiming themselves born-again Christians are either evil tools of the devil or so vapid and shallow and selfish that they will also rot in Hell. Women, even college student women, are so dumb they don't even know how to use the internet or e-mail. Etc., etc., etc.\n\nIn all, this was a terrible disappointment. The premise for these books could have made fabulous, intriguing, exciting reading, but the books are ruined by the authors' opinions and their poooooooooor writing. Don't bother.\n\nRating: 3\n\nSummary: Bad writing that I can't stop reading\n\nComment: I have somehow become hooked on these books. The reason I picked them up is because they are set in my hometown, Mt. Prospect, IL. Who'd have thunk it!\n\nThere is so much that drives me crazy about these books, for example, all the women seem incredibly whiny (I know they try to make Chloe seem strong and brave, but frequently I'd like to smack her) or soft and submissive; the anti-Catholic bias so typical of evangelical writers (of course, the pope would be the evil assistant of the Antichrist), and the beat you over the head preachy-ness of the message (Jesus Christ is my personal saviour...okay! I get it!) But in spite of how annoying the characters are (esp. the women) and how my Catholic sensibilities are offended, I keep reading these darn books to find out what happens next! I'll give LaHaye and Jenkins their due, they know how to keep you turning the pages. While I don't believe in \"The Rapture\" as they present it, it's an interesting view of the End Times that has caught my interest.\n\nFor those looking for a more erudite presentation of this topic and with a Catholic twist (and doesn't beat you over the head with Catholic dogma), I would recommend \"Father Elijah\" by Michael O'Brien. It is a more contempletive approach to End Days/Revelation literature. I'd also truly consider it literature. The Left Behind series is more what I'd consider entertainment (Jane Austen vs. Harlequin romance). The Left Behind books are interesting, they will get you thinking, but they'll never pass for great literature.\n\nRating: 4\n\nSummary: A PAGE TURNER\n\nComment: This fictional story takes place in the end times, beginning with the rapture of Christ's church. This is not the first time an End-time fiction has surfaced (The Omen, The Seventh Sign with Demi Moore, End of Days with Arnold Schwartzennager). This is, however, the first End-time fiction I have encountered that has the most biblical accuracy thus far. By the way, Mr. Alan Smith should try looking in 1Thessalonians 4:13-18 (particularly verses 16 through 18) to receive more clarity of the rapture.\n\nSimilar Books:\n\nTitle: Desecration: Antichrist Takes the Throne (Left Behind No. 9)\n\nby Tim LaHaye, Jerry B.
