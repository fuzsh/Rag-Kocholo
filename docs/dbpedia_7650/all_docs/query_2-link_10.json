        "text": "The American Baptist fundamentalist Tim LaHaye, who has died aged 90, was not swept up to heaven in the Rapture, as predicted in the 15 books of the Left Behind series that he co-authored, but he will have had the satisfaction of knowing that they are among the most widely read and profitable works of populist supposed-theology of the last 20 years. He was also a significant figure in the foundation of the religious right as a political force in the US, through the creation of organisations such as the Moral Majority in the early 1980s.\n\nThe Left Behind series, which came out annually between 1995 and 2007, sold at least 70m copies and at the height of its popularity brought its authors $15m (£11m) a year. The books, with their gloomy vision of the Saved and Unsaved, benefited from the shock to the American psyche caused by the attacks of 9/11 – the ninth in the series came out a month later – and undoubtedly struck a chord with fearful and credulous readers. In 2002 a poll found 62% of Americans believing in the imminent physical return of Jesus Christ to Earth.\n\nThe books’ premillennialist premise, based on a doctrine originally propounded by the 19th-century English preacher John Nelson Darby from his literalist reading of the Book of Revelation, is the imminent coming of the Last Days, in which the saved elect are taken safely up to heaven while the forces of evil battle for seven years over control of the Earth until the triumph of the returning Christ at the Battle of Armageddon and the institution of a 1,000-year reign of peace and harmony. The doctrine is shared by modern sects such as Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Plymouth Brethren.\n\nThe Left Behind series starts with the saved disappearing suddenly from among the passengers on a jumbo jet flying across the Atlantic, leaving only their clothes, jewellery, teeth fillings and surgical pins behind – LaHaye claimed to have got the original inspiration from watching cabin crew canoodling on a flight and wondering what would happen to them when the Rapture struck. In the book, cars on the ground are also suddenly left driverless – and the series continues excitingly through the following books with battles, helicopter chases, earthquakes, plagues of locusts and a supernatural horde of 200 million demonic horsemen. The books’ evil genius turns out to be a Romanian called Nicolae Carpathia, whose wicked Global Community regime, supposedly dedicated to fostering peace, world government and a single currency, bears a passing resemblance to the United Nations, or maybe the European Union.\n\nThe series has been read, mainly in the US, turned into CDs, DVDs – though the big Hollywood deal LaHaye prayed for never quite came off – clothes with Rapture logos and even a board game. LaHaye did not actually write the books himself, but subcontracted that to a former sports journalist called Jerry B Jenkins. “I consider myself the creator of the series,” LaHaye told me when I interviewed him in 2006. “I work up Jesus and the biblical commentaries and that gives the writer the idea of how the storyline should go. I am not a control freak – once I throw the ball I want him to run for the touchdown with it.” Subsequent writers on this and the later series, Babylon Rising, proved less congenial, being less susceptible to LaHaye’s world vision.\n\nThere were many more books, all propounding his apocalyptic philosophy and taking in traditional fundamentalist tropes. He did not care much for Jews, Anglicans, Muslims, and especially Roman Catholics – they were “pseudo-Christian and pagan” – and gay people, who were so “militant, organised and vile” that Leviticus’s injunction of capital punishment could only be seen as just and compassionate retribution. And he suspected that there was a worldwide conspiracy by the Illuminati, the secret society aiming to destroy every vestige of Christianity in order to establish a new world order. Socialists had taken over the education system as early as the 1830s, he insisted, and Europe, of course, was beyond the pale. “You over there in England, you’ve got false teaching, you don’t believe in the supernatural. You had this migration of Christians who came here and that’s stripped England of its religious base. The churches there are dead. What I want with my books is to force people to make decisions, to decide where they want to spend eternity … we are just laying it out plainly, making it as literal as possible.”\n\nSome of his views were even stranger: LaHaye may have been the last person to believe in the medieval idea that the body is controlled by humours – the LaHaye temperament analysis scheme was set up to prove this: “The Bible’s like looking at a medical book. This is the word of God – you can trust that,” he told me. His 1976 book The Act of Marriage propounded the theory that religious wives have more frequent and more enjoyable sex than their less religious counterparts.\n\nAll this might have been only quaint, but for LaHaye’s infusion into the politics of the US religious right. Along with several other bombastic evangelicals including Jerry Falwell, Oral Roberts and Jim Bakker, LaHaye was among a party invited to meet Jimmy Carter for a White House breakfast in 1980, where they were shocked to find the president – himself a Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher – was fundamentally unsound because he supported equal rights and the supreme court’s abortion judgment. LaHaye immediately led the group in prayer outside saying: “God, we have got to get this man out of the White House and get someone in here who will be aggressive about bringing back traditional moral values.” They then mobilised their followers for the divorced, non-churchgoing, former Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan instead.\n\nLaHaye, small, dapper, with dyed brown hair, was not mainly a televangelist. One of three children, he was the son of Frank LaHaye, a Detroit car worker of French Canadian origin, and his wife, Margaret (nee Palmer). His father died from a heart attack when his son was 10 years old and LaHaye dated his spiritual awakening from hearing the preacher at his father’s funeral promising that they would meet again one day when the Lord descended and they all gathered in the air. After wartime service in US air force bombers over Europe, LaHaye trained at the fundamentalist Bob Jones University in South Carolina and in 1950 received a doctorate in ministry at the Western Seminary in Washington state. In 1958 he and his family moved to San Diego in California, where he set up his own church and later a Christian college. Latterly he also contributed generously to Falwell’s Liberty University in Virginia, paying for a school of prophecy, a students’ union building and an ice hockey and skating centre.\n\nBy the 1970s he was increasingly involved in politics: he and his wife, Beverly, whom he had married in 1947, were supporters of the conspiratorial, virulently anti-communist John Birch Society; he sat on the board of Falwell’s Moral Majority; founded an organisation called the American Traditional Values Coalition; and set up the Pre-Tribulation Research Center, dedicated to looking out for signs of the coming Last Days and the imminence of the Rapture. Beverly started the conservative pressure group Concerned Women for America. Some of the ideas generated by LaHaye and his colleagues fed into public policy, most prominently in defence of Israel and its original biblical borders, since on the Last Day Jews will supposedly suddenly convert to Christianity and thus need to be cherished until they do.\n\nLaHaye’s own public political career was brief: he served as co-chairman of Jack Kemp’s presidential campaign in 1988 for four days until his anti-Catholic views became known and he was dropped from the ticket.\n\nLaHaye’s literary output slowed down after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2006. He died following a stroke. He is survived by Beverly and their four children, Linda, Larry, Lee and Lori."
