        "text": "American author\n\nJennifer Lynn Armentrout (born June 11, 1980), also known by the pseudonym J. Lynn,[1] is an American writer of contemporary romance, new adult and fantasy.[2][3] Several of her works have made The New York Times Best Seller list.[4][5]\n\nShe is considered a \"hybrid\" author, having successfully self-published while maintaining active contracts with small independent presses, and traditional publishers.[6][7] Her current publishers include Spencer Hill Press, Entangled Publishing, Harlequin Teen, Disney/Hyperion, and HarperCollins.[8]\n\nNot be confused with fellow novelist Jenny Gallifrey Joel Trout, who was born Jennifer Lynne Armintrout, also in 1980.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJennifer Lynn Armentrout was born in West Virginia.[9] She was inspired to become a writer after reading the works of L.J. Smith, including The Vampire Diaries, The Secret Circle Series, The Forbidden Games Series, and myriad others.[1] The book series that remained close to her heart was The Forbidden Games, with the final novel bringing her to tears. Upon completing the series she decided she wanted to leave the same impact on her future readers.[1]\n\nHer first experience with writing an actual novel was in high school during algebra class.[1][10] Despite her desire to be an author, she went to college and graduated with a major in psychology.[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite receiving a great deal of rejections before her career began, Armentrout's first book was published in 2011.[1] As of September 2019, she had fifty-three of her fifty-seven total written works published.[11] The majority of her published works for young adults are romance, fantasy and paranormal, and some contemporary and science fiction.[9] With her pseudonym J. Lynn,[1] she writes suspenseful romance novels for her adult readers.[10]\n\nIn 2013, her young adult novel Obsidian was optioned by Sierra Pictures,[12][13] but the rights were later returned to the author.[14]\n\nIn 2015, Armentrout's colleague suggested that she do a book signing for the first release in her Titan series.[1] She was opposed to doing a lonely and awkward book signing, so she asked authors to come join her in the daylong event.[1][15] After this, Armentrout created ApollyCon, which rapidly became a new way for authors and readers to come together in celebration of recently released books.[1][9][15] The convention's success continues to grow with each event.[15]\n\nShe is a #1 New York Times[1][9][10] and a USA Today Best Seller.[1][10] She has published books independently and with publishing companies, earning the title of being a \"hybrid\" author.[10]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nArmentrout was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa in 2015.[1][9][11] She has become passionate about teaching readers about it by being representative and spreading awareness.[1][9] She also enjoys being a source of support for her readers that share the same disorder.[9]\n\nAs of 2020, Armentrout lives with her husband, her dog Apollo, and her alpacas on a farm in Martinsburg, West Virginia.[16]\n\nShe likes writing stories for both age groups to prevent writer burnout.[9] Armentrout has said she writes for eight hours a day almost every day. During the creative process, she likes to alternate between typing and handwriting so she can avoid writer's block.[16]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks written under Jennifer L.
