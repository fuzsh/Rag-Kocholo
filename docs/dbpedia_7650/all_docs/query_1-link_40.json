        "text": "Overview\n\nLeft Behind (1995) is the first book in the series of the same name. It was co-authored by Tim LaHaye, a minister and prophecy scholar, and Jerry B. Jenkins, an author of mystery novels, biographies, and Christian fiction. The series is a work of speculative Christian fiction based on biblical prophecies related to the so-called “end times.” Its plot opens with “the Rapture,” a cataclysmic event discussed in biblical prophecy in which Jesus returns to earth to take his followers to heaven before their deaths. The world is then launched into a seven-year period of tribulation for those who have been “left behind.”\n\nThe series comprises 13 novels: Left Behind (1995), Tribulation Force (1996), Nicolae (1997), Soul Harvest (1998), Apollyon (1999), Assassins (1999), The Indwelling (2000), The Mark (2000), Desecration (2001), The Remnant (2002), Armageddon (2003), Glorious Appearing (2004), and Kingdom Come (2007). As the first novel in the series, Left Behind introduces the series’ overall premise and its main characters. As its events foreshadow the increasingly apocalyptic plot events that occur throughout the subsequent books, Left Behind also highlights the evangelical message of Jesus as the savior of humanity.\n\nThe series achieved extensive commercial success and is now part of a multimedia franchise that includes a three-book prequel, a series of 40 YA novellas, three companion books, and a video game. There have also been several film adaptations, including a 2014 production starring Nicholas Cage. Although the series has received praise for its function as an unusually wide-reaching work of Christian fiction, it has also been criticized for anti-Catholicism and anti-Judaism sentiments due to its premise that only Protestants who believe in Jesus as the messiah will be granted access to heaven. Later books in the series also include substantial anti-gay biases, as the Antichrist character, Nicolae Carpathia, was raised by two fathers. Critics have also suggested that the novels sensationalize violence.\n\nThis guide refers to the 1995 Tyndale edition.\n\nContent Warning: Both the source text and this guide contain descriptions of reductive and stereotyped views of ethnoreligious groups in Israel, as well as descriptions of violence and murder, and brief mentions of death by suicide.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe novel opens with airline pilot Rayford Steele piloting an overnight flight to London. His senior flight attendant, Hattie Durham, is a beautiful young woman with whom he has been considering initiating an affair. Panicked, she suddenly tells him that around 100 passengers, including all the children, have disappeared from the plane, leaving their clothing and jewelry behind. Rayford reflects on the fact that his wife, Irene, has recently become an Evangelical Christian. He begins to fear that the disappearances were caused by the “Rapture” that she has described, in which Jesus returns to earth, taking his followers to heaven and signaling the beginning of the “end times.”\n\nAlso on the plane is Cameron “Buck” Williams, a successful journalist. Buck remembers an interview that he conducted with Chaim Rosenzweig, an Israeli chemical engineer who invented a fertilizer that has made desert land fertile and initiated a period of extreme prosperity for Israel. Buck also recalls being in Israel when Russia attacked in retaliation for the smaller nation’s success. At the time, the Russian air force was mysteriously destroyed, and Israel sustained no casualties.\n\nVia radio, another pilot advises Rayford to turn back and land at Chicago O’Hare. On the ground, they learn of turmoil around the world because similar disappearances have occurred everywhere, instantaneously. Numerous accidents have been caused by the disappearance of individuals who were operating vehicles, and there are extensive casualties as well as disappearances.\n\nWhen Rayford returns home, his suspicions about the Rapture are confirmed, for both his wife, Irene, and his young son, Raymie, have disappeared. He attempts to contact his daughter, Chloe, who is a student at Stanford, and learns that she has not disappeared and is attempting to make her way home.\n\nMeanwhile, Buck connects with his boss, Steve Plank, and begins making plans to write about the disappearances and other important world events, which include upcoming meetings about global currency and a new world order. Additionally, a young Romanian businessman named Nicolae Carpathia has been invited to speak at the UN and has been appointed President of Romania without an election. Buck also has a tip from a contact in London about a meeting of international financiers that is poised to push the introduction of a global currency with the UN.\n\nBuck learns that his contact in London, Dirk Burton, has died by suicide. Buck doesn’t believe this and travels to London to investigate. In a London pub, he meets with Alan Tompkins, a contact at Scotland Yard. Alan tells Buck that Dirk was killed to silence his suspicions about Todd-Cothran and Stonagal, members of the group of international financial power players. However, Alan advises Buck not to investigate because he has been threatened by Todd-Cothran. When Alan returns to the car, he is killed in an explosion. Buck flees to Germany on a false passport.\n\nWhen Chloe arrives home, she and Rayford contact Bruce Barnes, the visitation pastor at the church that Irene had been attending; Bruce is one of the very few members of the congregation who have been left behind. Together, they watch a tape that the senior pastor left for this occasion, in which he explains that the Rapture has happened and believers have been taken to heaven. The pastor also describes the seven-year tribulation period that will follow, along with the imminent appearance of the deceptive Antichrist and the path to salvation through belief in Jesus. While Chloe remains skeptical of this message, Rayford is convinced and prays for salvation.\n\nBack in the United States, Buck attends a press conference and witnesses Carpathia’s speech to the UN. The Romanian president exhibits in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the UN and is a very compelling speaker. He discusses his aspirations for global disarmament and suggests that he disbelieves the Rapture theory and instead believes that the disappearances were caused by an atmospheric phenomenon made possible by nuclear power.\n\nHaving been invited to meet with Carpathia, Buck trades credentials with his boss, Steve, in order to keep the meeting. Meanwhile, Steve is apprehended by international authorities who want to question Buck in relation to the deaths of Dirk and Alan in London. Buck is impressed by Carpathia’s charisma and unassuming nature. After Carpathia uses his influence with Stonagal and Todd-Cothran to make the problem of Buck’s potential extradition disappear, he then insinuates that both men will be useful to his rise to power, but that he will deal with them eventually.\n\nOn Hattie’s request, Buck introduces her to Carpathia. Steve announces that he has taken a job as Carpathia’s press secretary. In New York, Buck and Hattie go to meet Rayford and Chloe. Buck and Chloe are immediately attracted to each other. Rayford attempts to tell Hattie about his conversion and what he believes about the Rapture, but she remains hurt by his actions and is more interested in bragging about having met Carpathia. Buck asks to interview Rayford for his story on the disappearances.\n\nRayford, Hattie, Chloe, and Buck have dinner together for the interview. Rayford tells the others what he believes about Jesus and the reason for the disappearances. Although Rayford does not believe that he is getting through to his companions, both Chloe and Buck are deeply affected. The next day, Buck surprises Chloe by arranging to be seated next to her on their flight to Chicago. While there, he plans to meet with Bruce Barnes and watch the pastor’s tape. Chloe interprets Buck’s presence as an answer to a prayer and converts to Christianity on the plane.\n\nIn Israel, two prophets styling themselves as Eli and Moishe start preaching at the Wailing Wall. Via news coverage, Buck observes an attacker attempting to kill them. Both assailants die instantly of apparent heart attacks. Bruce suggests that the two prophets are those described in the book of Revelation: the ones who will convert 144,000 Orthodox Jews to belief in Jesus, then be killed and resurrected.\n\nCarpathia is appointed the new secretary general of the UN. Upon his acceptance of the role, he has stipulated that the UN headquarters must be moved to Babylon, and he also insists upon instituting a global religion and initiating global denuclearization. Al of his conditions have been agreed upon. Buck converts to Christianity immediately prior to attending a meeting and press conference announcing Carpathia’s new role. Upon entering the room, Buck sees Hattie, who has been appointed as Carpathia’s personal assistant. Suddenly, Carpathia disarms a security guard and executes Stonagal and Todd-Cothran. He then has Hattie call 911 and hypnotizes everyone in the room to believe that Stonagal shot Todd-Cothran and himself. Everyone but Buck appears to believe this alternate version of events. Now certain that Carpathia is the Antichrist, Buck joins Rayford, Chloe, and Bruce in their mission to form a “Tribulation Force” to work against Carpathia during the seven-year period of tribulations to follow."
