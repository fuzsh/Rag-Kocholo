        "text": "You would be wise to question your God.\n\nOver a thousand years have passed since the first Godstones ripped through the skies and mangled the earth. With their fall came centuries of chaos and destruction, but also immense power.\n\nPower that separates humans from Gods.\n\nNow, in the Kingdom of Azanthea, two adoptive brothers flee from unjust conscription.\n\nA fugitive heiress of a slaughtered people struggles to truly be free.\n\nA double-crossing warrior must choose where his allegiances lie: with his wife or with his daughter.\n\nA traitorous heir to the Kingdom‚Äôs throne roams the lands in search of an army to call his own.\n\nA prodigy in the House of Historian competes in a grueling trial to prove her loyalty.\n\nAnd one God-King rules over them all.\n\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ\n\nIf you like stunning fantasy worlds, dystopian future settings, incredible magic sources, heartwarming family narratives, cute gay girls, possible love triangles, mysterious god-like figures, intense political intrigue, and a villain-turned-maybe-friend-maybe-not, this book is definitely for you!\n\nThe first in Keylin River‚Äôs Highwings series, it follows six characters ‚Äî Ion, Kuba, Aurelia, Rohan, Vallich, and Kari ‚Äî with the God-King Apollyon lurking like a shadow through every chapter. To some, he‚Äôs a king. To others, he‚Äôs a killer. Loyalties will be questioned as war brews, and no one knows who they can trust, especially when questioning the God-King can mean certain death.\n\nThe main plot follows adoptive brothers Ion and Kuba as they flee conscription into Apollyon‚Äôs United Azanthean Army, leaving behind their small mountain village and venturing out into a world where it seems everyone is fighting everyone else. Kuba, the younger of the two, hasn‚Äôt seen his own parents in years after they were drafted into the House of Historians, a mysterious group of people who are only loyal to one person: the God-King. When a Godstone falls from the sky and gives Kuba a rare power ‚Äî the power to Wield lightning ‚Äî suddenly everyone seems to be tracking them down. The brothers are saved from the army by the alluring Aurelia, a Fire-Wielder from the North, who agrees to help them get to the Free-Wielders where they will be safe. She teaches Kuba how to focus on his Wield to get them where they need to be, but after they are almost caught by the army, they reluctantly allow a new person into their group. The same traitorous heir to the Kingdom‚Äôs throne who Apollyon is hunting down. Vallich, going by the name Vincent among the trio, is more interested in figuring out who the lightning Wielder is, and building his own army to take down Apollyon. A murderous little beast, everyone knows Vallich is cruel and will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, but he carefully conceals his ulterior motives from the trio while they figure out how to find the Free-Wielders with the help of a disguised soldier, Rohan. During their journey, Vallich pushes Kuba to the edge to teach him how to Wield, and even though Kuba sees him as a friend, Ion and Aurelia are not so sure they can trust him. After parting ways and the trio sails to the Free Wielders, they learn that an army led by a ruthless non-Wielder is sailing to their shores to stop the rebellion. Rohan‚Äôs wife, Elara, is the leader of the Free Wielders, but Rohan‚Äôs loyalties are torn between her and his daughter, training with the army. Meanwhile, in the House of Historians, Kari struggles to move past Vallich‚Äôs betrayal to the God-King, while keeping the secret to herself the entire time. An Ascension Trial must take place to declare a new heir, and Kari is one of the promised competitors. When the trials begin, she starts to question how true the God-King must be to allow so much death. But questioning the God-King could lead to her death, so she keeps her fears to herself, until she learns something truly horrifying about the God-King and his powers. An epic battles takes place on the island where the Free-Wielders live, and while Kuba, Vallich, and Aurelia are reunited, Ion has been injured in battle and has gone missing. The book ends on an enticing cliffhanger from Kari‚Äôs point of view in the Azanthean dungeons.\n\nThe first thing that really grabbed my attention in this book, aside from that beautiful cover, was the worldbuilding. Keylin does a fantastic job of infusing new magic in a typical fantasy setting, without making it obvious that this book is set in the far, far future. The Godstones that fall from the sky have the power of whatever they touched first ‚Äî fire, water, earth, diamonds, any kind of element including the rare and elusive element of lightning. The first person to touch a Godstone becomes a Wielder, but it‚Äôs not easy to hold a Wield or even use in battle because it drains the user‚Äôs energy. This kind of magic is new and exciting and refreshing to see in young adult fantasy, and really ups the ante in certain settings. A Fire-Wielder in the snow can‚Äôt do much against her enemies without exhausting all her energy, but these characters learned to adapt. Even Kuba is resilient and determined to grasp lightning before it strikes the ground.\n\nThe world itself is absolutely amazing to read about. The brothers are forced to flee Zar, through the forest of Reinbeck, to Sable, to Spearield. An elegant map at the beginning shows just how far they are willing to go for their family. We learn a little bit about the North, where Aurelia is from, but I‚Äôm excited to learn more in the rest of the series. There is still so much of the world left unexplored.\n\nThe characters, oh, the characters! These characters will stay with you. Ion and Kuba are the brotherly-est brothers I have ever read, and they will do anything for each other and their family. Ion is a little laid-back and Kuba struggles with panic attacks (Keylin does a masterful job at describing them in a fantasy setting where there really isn‚Äôt a word for ‚Äúpanic attack‚Äù), but Ion knows exactly what to do to help his little brother. His advice guides him to connecting with his Godstone as well.\n\nAt first, I wasn‚Äôt too keen on reading about two brothers for the entire novel, but then Aurelia came onto the scene, and I fell in love with her. Witty, snarky, badass. She blasted enough soldiers away to earn a spot in my heart within the first few chapters. Plus, with a tragic backstory, I knew I would love her from the start. (There may or may not be a possible relationship between her and Ion; that‚Äôs up to you to decide üòâ)\n\nAurelia is definitely my favourite character, but Vallich is a close second, despite being an absolute ass for the majority of the book. He‚Äôs also the one character everyone else hates. With a passion. And fury. He did help kill a lot of people under Apollyon‚Äôs orders, after all. Also snarky, very sassy, with a god complex to boot, I absolutely love the power dynamic between him and Aurelia during their interactions. (Please, Keylin, let them get together!)\n\nKari is up there with Vallich, mostly because she keeps eyeing her other scantily-clad competitor and IS VERY GAY for her. I love that. And, oh, did I mention Dane??? Canonically trans Dane??? Love. (Dane doesn‚Äôt get a POV, which is a crime.)\n\nRohan‚Ä¶to be honest, I didn‚Äôt care for Rohan, which might be the only reason I didn‚Äôt give a whole five stars. I felt as though his conflict ‚Äî his wife or his daughter ‚Äî was forced throughout most of his chapters to create tension and emotion, but it was just a lot of crying between him and Elara. I have to say, I screamed when he chose his daughter (if you‚Äôve read the book, you know the part where he does the thing). That was exciting, but his chapters didn‚Äôt add much to the rest of the story for me.\n\nKeylin‚Äôs writing is easy to read and creates beautiful images in the mind, while leaning a little to the telling side of show, don‚Äôt tell. Overall, a quick read, and enough POVs to keep it interesting without dragging down any one narrative. I would have loved to read more about the Ascension Trials and Kari, but I‚Äôm looking forward to her development in the next book. Plus that ending! I screamed! I cried! A fantastic job ending on a cliffhanger.\n\nGet your hands on this book if you like: diverse characters, stunning worldbuilding, awesome powers, funny quips, plot twists, and a cliffhanger ending that will leave you craving more!\n\nBuy All The King‚Äôs Traitors now from Amazon\n\nAdd it on Goodreads\n\n‚ÄúKay‚Äôs Raves‚Äù is a new blog series where I review books I‚Äôve read recently, starting with Keylin River‚Äôs All the King‚Äôs Traitors. Keylin was so generous to let me read her incredible fantasy for an honest review. Thank you so much, Keylin, and I can‚Äôt wait to read the next one! All the Queen‚Äôs Renegades comes out early 2020!\n\nWhat. A. Year. Where have the past few months gone???\n\nWhen I think back to last December, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that so much has changed in a year. I thought I‚Äôd still be stuck ‚Äî stuck in a boring job, stuck in my parents‚Äô house, stuck in my writing career. Just overall stuck in place, unable to move forward. While I‚Äôm still stuck in some regards, so much has changed for me.\n\nSince January, I:\n\npierced my nose\n\ntook an ASL class\n\ngot promoted\n\nstarted a new writing project\n\nwent on my first writing retreat\n\nmoved out of my parents‚Äô house\n\nbought a car\n\ngot a new tattoo\n\nwent to Galaxy‚Äôs Edge at Disney World\n\ndyed my hair purple\n\nbought tickets to see Hamilton\n\nadopted a cat with my roommates\n\nbooked a flight for another writing retreat\n\nSome of these things might not seem like much, but even dyeing my hair, getting a new tattoo, and getting another piercing have really helped me realize the kind of person I want to be. I tried acrylic nails for the first time this year, I built a lightsaber at Savi‚Äôs Workshop, I saw Newsies on stage with my mum. The little things add up to big changes, but I‚Äôm mostly excited about the fact that I moved into my own place with two amazing roommates and I can finally be my own person, the real me, whoever she is (I‚Äôm still figuring that one out).\n\nI‚Äôm still at the same job I was at last December, but I now have a full-time position and I‚Äôve moved into a larger location inside the airport which gives me more opportunities to learn new things and rise through the ranks.\n\nI‚Äôve also put aside The Fallen Star for now, but I‚Äôm working on a new project: Wicked Saints meets Raiders of the Lost Ark. It‚Äôs my first time plotting and outlining a story, so I‚Äôm excited to see where it goes. I stopped writing every day earlier this year, and I‚Äôve learned to give myself permission to take breaks from writing to develop my craft, and it‚Äôs really helped. My writing is becoming stronger, plots more coherent, characters more rounded. I‚Äôm going on my second writing retreat in January ‚Äî this time, flying alone for the first time!\n\nNot only has this year been a year of change, the last decade has been quite the whirlwind, too. I:\n\nmet my first (and only) boyfriend (and broke up months later)\n\nhad my first (and only) kiss\n\ngot my first summer job\n\nlost contact with literally everyone from high school\n\nlearned Irish\n\ngraduated with distinction in Celtic Studies & English\n\nwent to Ireland for the first time\n\nlost contact with literally everyone from university\n\nworked in social media marketing for two years\n\nlost contact with literally everyone from that job\n\nwent to Disney too many times to count\n\nwrote my first novel (and its sequel)\n\nmet the voice actor of Ahsoka Tano\n\nstarted my teapot collection\n\nlearned I have dermatillomania\n\nI am probably missing so many things from these lists, but a few things have stayed the same: my love of Disney, stars, and Starbucks being a few of them. I‚Äôve also grown to be more accepting and realized I was bi/ace. I‚Äôm still figuring some things out, and I‚Äôll probably always wonder why I don‚Äôt have any solid friendships (or lose the ones I make), but I‚Äôm hoping for bright things in 2020 and the next decade.\n\nWhat has been your proudest accomplishment this year? Let me know in the comments!\n\nAs always,\n\nHappy Canada Day long weekend! üá®üá¶ And Happy July 4th to my American friends!\n\nJune‚Ä¶sucked, in many regards. I made some high hopes for June in my May Overview and barely accomplished any of them. Here‚Äôs what happened this month.\n\nWriting\n\nMay was absolutely fantastic for me in terms of my writing. I wrote over 40,000 words, and then had a crisis at the beginning of June, and wrote nothing all month.\n\nI didn‚Äôt write another 40,000 on my novel. I didn‚Äôt finish it. And I certainly have not thought about the sequel.\n\nWhen I attended Maggie Stiefvater‚Äôs Portraits & Dreams writing seminar on June 3 in Toronto, she offered invaluable and incredible advice. Most of which I have taken to heart. But it got me thinking about all the things that were wrong in my novel, and I decided to put that aside for awhile. It wasn‚Äôt the story I wanted it to be, and maybe I wasn‚Äôt the writer I needed to be in order to write that story. After some thinking, I figured out how to move forward with that novel, but I‚Äôm letting it stew for now. It needs to breathe. I‚Äôve been working on it since 2016, and Maggie said if it‚Äôs been longer than a year, I need to move on. I‚Äôm not giving up on it, but I‚Äôm trying something new.\n\nThat being said, this new thing is‚Ä¶exciting. I‚Äôm working on plotting and outlining for the first time in my life, and I have a new idea that is almost ready to be put on paper. I‚Äôve read many books and watched many youtube videos about the craft, and I‚Äôm allowing myself to develop my writing the way it was meant to. I‚Äôm taking time to really think about what I want this story to say and I‚Äôm really excited to start writing it in July. My (unofficial) Camp NaNo goal is to write half of this new project. Plus, I‚Äôm going on a writing retreat (my first ever!) this month, so I‚Äôm hoping to get a lot of writing done then.\n\nPersonal\n\nMy friend and I heard back last week from a potential apartment, but then‚Ä¶nothing. They asked us if we were still interested, and we haven‚Äôt heard anything since. I‚Äôm not giving up hope on this place.\n\nOther than that, we‚Äôre still looking. Fingers crossed something happens in July.\n\nWork\n\nWell, the changes happened! I was officially promoted to a full-time position at work. My manager is now working closely with me to train me on things that will hopefully lead to more opportunities, like assistant manager. It‚Äôs fun.\n\nJune flew by faster than I thought it would. Work kept me busy, and I completely forgot about my bullet journal, but I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve been bored. I did, however, catch a cold, so I‚Äôve been fighting that since Wednesday. Plus, I had a funeral to go to on Saturday, which is never fun. I‚Äôm hoping July slows down a bit so I can catch up on my writing. Also, I did not read a single book this month. Maybe one in July? We‚Äôll see. Check back in next month!\n\nAs always, happy writing! üòé"
