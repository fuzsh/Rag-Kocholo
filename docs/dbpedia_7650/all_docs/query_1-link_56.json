        "text": "The forest starts to smell like rotten eggs because there are stinky Tanika Monsters around. The children, who are listening to Epstein, find that fact funny.\n\nAs the rider passes around a boulder formation, someone attempts two times to shoot him with an arrow. We don’t know who attacked the rider, and the children don’t bother to ask Epstein about it. In fact, at first I thought that the Tanika Monsters were flighting arrows at the rider.\n\nThe rider (who was referred to as “he” several paragraphs back) is revealed to be Gertrude, a woman with a long black hair. She arrives at Apollyon’s Glacier Palace. Her stallion is described as “an animal with fiery and dangerous eyes”, even though nothing so far had given me the impression that Gertrude’s horse is of a particularly fiery character.\n\nThe guards let her inside to meet Apollyon and his sons, Abbadon and Plouton.\n\nThis book overuses exclamation marks!\n\nThis is slightly confusing. So, Maya and Joey had arrived in Maradonia, and the Whisperers of Light told that to a certain Girl (who’s, apparently, not Maya), that Girl wrote it in a journal, and Apollyon’s spies found that Girl. Why did this Girl (who is seemingly on the Light side) give the information about Maya and Joey to Pollo’s spies is not explained. Was her journal stolen? Was she threatened by the spies? I have no idea. I wonder if Gloria does.\n\nApollyon says that he needs to wait for the Hoodmen’s report. Gertrude is dissapointed that her message is of secondary importance to the King. So, Gertrude is a composite character for Dark Fairy Gertrude and Arabella of the original book. I admit, it was a good idea on the editor’s part to combine some of the original’s loads of pointless characters into one.\n\nThe Hoodmen are also hunting for the journal. I don’t quite understand why, if Apollyon’s spies are already able to somehow extract information from that Girl. It seems that they’re unable to get the information of what happened after “several twilights ago”, but it’s not clear at all.\n\nTwo Hoodmen appear before Apollyon. They’re called Kobaldo, which is a name Gloria probably invented herself, and Kasimir, which is a respectable Polish name. Name randomness ahoy!\n\nOkay, I am willing to excuse the lack of apostophe. But Wand? Not just a wand, but Wand? Is Gloria attempting to get my mind into the gutter?\n\nThe Hoodmen were unable to get the journal, because the Girl is protected by the King of Light. Apollyon is not pleased to hear this:\n\nAnother good change. This Apollyon makes more sense as an Evil King then the original one, who was all like “Huh, my son and his huge army lost a battle with teenagers. Ah well, he tried his best, so shucks”. And the italics are actually appropriate here. With this paragraph, the writing lifts itself for a bit from “bad and confusing” to “slightly below mediocre”.\n\nAnd the writing goes down again. Yeah, Gloria, we see that the Hoodmen have stealing in their Code, we get that stealing is wrong.\n\nThe second paragraph… I’ll have to let it speak for itself.\n\nKasimir is slightly insolent towards Apollyon, demonstrating with his behaviour that he doesn’t believe in these two children’s importance. Kobaldo tries to get Kasimir to realize that he can’t behave himself like that, but Kasimir insults him, calling him a “Doussel”. Apollyon’s reaction is again reasonable for an Evil King –\n\nBut the phrasing again makes my mind go to the gutter. Why did you capitalize “Wand”, Gloria?\n\nBoth Hoodmen start laughing at Apollyon’s words. Now, that doesn’t make sense at all, since the Evil King Apollyon has already shown his displeasure at the Hoodmen’s refusal to realize the threat’s importance. Furthemore, their laughing is horribly written:\n\nApollyon reverts back to his previous self. Instead of severely punishing his servants for their blatant insolence, he starts to scream Ice Cream Koans at them:\n\nNo comment.\n\nThe Hoodmen flee in panic, since Apollyon, while shouting the same saying, creates lighting out of midair. Looks like I misguided Apollyon’s benevolence, even though the effect is severely harmed by the moralistic Ice Cream.\n\nAbbadon and Plouton promise Apollyon to find the two children themselves. Apollyon encourages them and then dissappears with a “boisterous” voice crying “go… for the kill!” I guess it’s better then “I am going to keeeel yyyeeeww” of the Maradonia Book Trailer.\n\nEpstein stops talking for a while, but the class demands to hear more about the children. The professor mentions that the book about Apollyon and Ruach's conflict is ancient (prolly like the Bible, duh), unlike the story of Apollyon's conflict with Maya and Joey. Then he basically quotes one of the Maradonia reviews, and continues with the story.\n\nAaand we’re at Chapter One, witch is the equivalent of Chapter Two of the original. The events evolve pretty much the same, Maya and Joey are getting ready for a new school. Unlike in the original, little Brother Benji and Our Heroes’ family name – Swanson - are mentioned right from the start\n\nWe get a paragraph that violates the “Show, not tell” rule –\n\nBut we are actually spared the descriptions of newborn Maya being \"a very serious child\" and Joey's drawing talent at age four. Good to see that the Tesches had seen some reason here.\n\nMother Swanson starts to lecture her daughter that she needs to overcome her shyness. Maya fakes a smile and kisses her mother goodbye. This episode actually makes Maya sort of sympathetic – or would, if I hadn’t already known everything about Maya.\n\nThey walk into the classroom.\n\nWe get it, Gloria. Our generation is corrupt and mediocre.\n\nA “dark hair girl” (sic) trips Maya as she walks towards her seat, making it seem like Maya tripped herself. With great joy I discover that Alana Terrence, my favourite character from the old Maradonia, was not edited out.\n\nAhahaha. What does that even mean?\n\nChapter Two. We see that picture of Maya and Alana fighting.\n\nAlana and her gang, Tanya and Dorothy sense “something different” in Maya and persecute her. We are treated to Maya complaining about Alana to her new friend, Rachel. Then Alana comes in, accuses Maya of “talking crap” about Alana (she’s actually correct this time), and then the situation develops just like in the original.\n\nThat time, however, Maya doesn’t have a “black belt in carate”. Another minor improvement.\n\nUh-huh. Sounds like this trait of Gloria’s writing is still present in the edited version.\n\nIn the beginning of Chapter Three, Joey is apparently “irritated since he had watched the beating of Alana”. We don’t know why. He still invites Maya to the birthday party, and the free preview ends here.\n\n---------------------------------------- -\n\nWell, well, well. What can we say about the edited version?\n\nIt managed to remove the most blatant howlers of the original, and improves the level of writing from “I didn’t even know that writing so horribly was even possible!” to “Just plain horrible, with an occasional rise to mediocre for a paragraph or two”.\n\nThe quality of writing is, excepting the not-9/11 fail for now, slightly higher in the parts dealing with the Professor Epstein “frame story”. The writing is at its most horrible when it closely follows the original storyline.\n\nIt looks like it will closely follow the original plot, paying lip service to the “novel-within-a-novel” technique, and fixing the blatant WTFisms, but occasionally adding new ones.\n\nThe overall result, so far, made the book more boring, if anything. Original Maradonia on occasion crosses the line twice, but the new version rarely does it. Old Maya and Joey, with their litany of ridiculous abilities since early childhood, provided, at least, some amount of fun. The new ones seem rather bland in comparison.\n\nThe greatest WTF of the new version is, of course, the 9/11 fiasco. How did the Tesches got the idea to attempt that little bit of emotional exploitation? Did they think that it adds ‘deep moral meaning of the battle between good versus evil’ to their Maradonia-Fantasy or something?\n\nPoints for trying, I guess."
