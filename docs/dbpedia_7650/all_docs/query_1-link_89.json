        "text": "book review Religious fiction's strong pulse reinforced by 'Left Behind' series\n\nBy Kelly Milner Halls\n\nSpecial to The Denver Post\n\nOct. 31 - A surprising new wave is rumbling through the publishing world, and Colorado Springs-based novelist Jerry Jenkins is unquestionably riding the curl. Thanks to Jenkins' phenomenal \"Left Behind'' book series, religious fiction has been born again.\n\nChristian fiction is not a new genre. The Christian Booksellers Association has tracked the best in non-secular reading for more than 50 years. The Evangelical Christian Publishers Association celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. What has changed, according to Lynn Garrett, religion editor at the books trade publication Publisher's Weekly, is the level of sophistication.\n\n\"Traditionally, the Christian book industry has functioned within a world of its own,'' Garrett said. \"But in recent years, the quality of the writing, the marketing and the overall effort has been improving substantially. The \"Left Behind' series is the perfect example of what can happen when it all comes together within that niche.''\n\nIt's not that Jenkins is the first Christian best seller. According to Garrett, there have always been success stories within religious ranks. \"Novelist Frank Peretti is probably the granddaddy of the genre and laid the foundation for the religious thriller,'' she said. Peretti's signature novel, \"This Present Darkness,'' has sold nearly 2.5 million copies since it was released in 1986. The sequel, \"Piercing the Darkness,'' released two years later, has sold nearly 2 million copies. \"That's unheard of in Christian fiction,'' Garrett said.\n\n\"Janette Oke is another powerhouse in her own right,'' Garrett continued. \"She writes romance (period pieces about the Canadian prairie) and must have a combined total of more than 14 million books in print.''\n\nIn fact, the Canadian Booksellers Association honored Oke with a lifetime achievement tribute in July for topping 19 million in sales - an event Jenkins emceed. But the marketing of Christian heavy hitters like Peretti and Oke has been topically, if not intentionally, limited. For example, until recently, Publisher's Weekly refused to review even the most promising of \"Christian'' fiction alongside secular work. \"So they didn't penetrate general trade,'' Garrett said. When Tyndale House Publishers Inc. first geared up to produce and market its apocalyptic \"Left Behind'' book series, they followed the same, familiar trail. But they started with the strength of unarguable experience.\n\nWith more than 130 published books and years of journalistic bylines under his belt, author Jerry Jenkins had been around the professional block, long before he tackled \"Left Behind.'' \"My whole life is writing,'' Jenkins said. \"It's been my full-time job for the last 10 years. Before that, I consistently wrote on the side.''\n\nBiblical scholar Dr. Tim LaHaye, who created the concept and constructed the scriptural outline upon which Jenkins built his fiction, had studied prophecy for more than 50 years. \"He's been a lifelong student of the Bible,'' Jenkins said. \"In fact, his study began before I was born.''\n\nNext came Tyndale's marketing strategy. \"They did a great job,'' Garrett said. \"After the first few \"Left Behind' books found great acceptance with chains like Borders and Barnes & Noble, Tyndale did what's called a \"one day lay-down' with the last book.'' That means they delivered \"Assassins'' to all the stores, nationwide, on the same day.\n\n\"That gave it the sales velocity it needed to make the best-seller lists,'' Garrett said.\n\nEven so, \"Apollyon,'' the predecessor to \"Assassins,'' debuted at No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list, went to No. 1 on Amazon.com, and No. 2 on the Wall Street Journal's list without a laydown or unified street date.\n\nHistoric timing may have also helped fuel \"Left Behind's'' celestial rockets. \"The approach of the new millennium, of course, that's the final element. The books don't expressly say the end of the world is coming with the end of the century,'' Garrett said. \"But the timing is no accident.''\n\nAccording to the author, it was exactly that - a fluke. \"No one was thinking end of the millennium in 1995 when we started working together,'' Jenkins said, \"and Dr. LaHaye had actually been looking for a writer since 1985.''\n\nJenkins is also emphatic about his refusal to second-guess the Scriptures. \"The books are set in the future, could be tomorrow, could be a thousand years from now. Dr. LaHaye and I vigorously maintain that no man knows the day or hour (not even Jesus, but only the Father), and feel that the year 2000 would be way too predictable.''\n\nOne thing experts like Garrett might not have anticipated was what literary agent Rick Chris tian calls \"the God factor.'' \"People are talking,'' according to the president of Alive Communications, Jenkins and LaHaye's literary agency, also based in Colorado Springs. \"They're telling their friends, they're buying copies for family members. I was with Jerry at a midnight book signing in Phoenix for the release of \"Assassins' and 1,000 people showed up, many of whom bought five or six copies. They wanted each signed to a different person. That's buzz.''\n\n\"There is a wider and wider gulf between our secular sides and our religious sides in society,'' said Mike Trout, vice president of broadcasting at Focus on the Family. \"It's obvious when you go to the movies, watch television and look at many of the magazines out there, that we are moving further and further into areas once considered taboo.''\n\nBut on the other side, church attendance has never been higher. \"When people like Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye write a series that speaks to the heart of what the Bible says, Christian people are drawn to it,'' Trout continued. \"When they are as credible as Jerry and Tim, we can be sure there will be a lot of meat to the stories. We can be sure it's not just watered-down soup. That combination assures a loyal Christian audience and a healthy Christian market. That kind of combination helps guarantee success.''\n\nThe measure of success, according to Jenkins, is incredibly humbling. \"I had hoped we might have a Christian best seller,'' he said, \"maybe sell 100,000 or 200,000 copies. But the first book in the series alone started its 49th print run in September. The books are selling at an average of 1.1 million copies a month, according to Publisher's Weekly. \"Left Behind' has a Web site (www.leftbehind.com) that gets 80,000 hits a day.\n\n\"I'd love to say it's the great writing that's inspired this success,'' Jenkins joked, \"but it's so big, I know it isn't me. You'd have to say this is a God thing. I just feel blessed to be a part of the team.''"
