Because Max has no sons, the right to be called head of the former Bavarian Royal House will pass after his death to a cousin, Prince Luitpold of Bavaria or to Luitpold's son, Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, and his descendants. The position of heir of the House of Stuart will pass to Max's eldest daughter Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein.\n\nAncestry\n\nahnentafel-compact5\n\nstyle=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%;\n\nborder=1\n\nboxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;\n\nboxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n\nboxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n\nboxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n\nboxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n\nboxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n\n1= 1.
