My future daughter-in-law is a very intelligent and educated woman,\" said his father, Prince Luitpold (71), owner of Kaltenberg Castle, to BILD.\n\nNow he is looking forward to grandchildren. “I hope they start a family soon. It is very gratifying that Ludwig is now more in Bavaria again. He worked as a development worker in Africa for almost 10 years.”\"\n\nHere is a photo of her and some data:\n\nhttps://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/sophie-evekink\n\nShe seems to have accomplished a glittering and exciting career. Interesting that she is apparently willing to give it all up to become a consort (the Bavarians are obviously no longer ruling, but they seem to approach the headship of the house as a full-time office much like reigning families).\n\nFranz, Duke of Bavaria, and his partner Dr. Thomas Greinwald attended the 42nd Oberammergauer Passionsspiele at Passionstheater in Oberammergau, Germany on May 14:\n\n** Pic 1 ** Pic 2 **\n\nFranz, Duke of Bavaria, and his partner Dr. Thomas Greinwald attended the Bayreuth Festival today, July 25:\n\n** Pic **\n\nI recall reading on another forum that Duke Franz refused (some years ago) to permit others to photograph him with Thomas Greinwald when they attended events. If true, it seems that someone or some people have had a change of heart.\n\nShe seems to have accomplished a glittering and exciting career. Interesting that she is apparently willing to give it all up to become a consort\n\nWell, Sophie Evekink is going to become a Bavarian Princess and her future husband, Prince Ludwig, is deeply and heavily involved in African projects to help the folks there, while she has already worked for the United Nations in comparable projects... Her future is not that much off her past.\n\nDoes anyone know when he’s getting married?\n\nThe engagement was only announced a week ago and it was said that not Wedding Date had been choosen. My guess is that they will marry sometime next year, but i would not bet that there will be an official announcement about date and location.\n\nI recall reading on another forum that Duke Franz refused (some years ago) to permit others to photograph him with Thomas Greinwald when they attended events. If true, it seems that someone or some people have had a change of heart.\n\nThey have now been seen often together at Events. I think one of the first times they where seen together and photographed was the Wedding of Prince Georg Friedrich of Prussia in 2011.\n\nPerhaps I have missed an interview, but where was it said that the fiancee will give up her career? What would prevent her from continuing it after her marriage?\n\nIt was as I said an inference (hence the \"apparently\") from the family heads' current approach. As far as I have read, it appears the current head Franz, his brother Max Emanuel (head of the ducal line) and Max's wife Elizabeth have not had careers outside of administering the family's foundations and businesses and charitable work in Bavaria.\n\nIt was as I said an inference (hence the \"apparently\") from the family heads' current approach.
