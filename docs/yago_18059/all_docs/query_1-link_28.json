        "text": "Scenes from a Habsburg Queen's Coronation\n\nNYPL, Spencer Collection\n\nMaria Theresa (1717–1780) was crowned Archduchess of Austria, Queen of Hungary, and Queen of Bohemia (the present-day Czech Republic) in 1740. She was the wife of Franz Stephan (1708–1765), Duke of Lothringia, who from 1745 to 1765 ruled the Holy Roman Empire as Franz I. After her husband’s death, she became the de facto ruler of the empire, although she was never officially crowned empress. Her accession triggered the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48) with neighboring Prussia.\n\nShe was an extraordinarily forceful ruler, deeply religious and an advocate for and executor of many significant reforms. Her reign also witnessed a period of literary and musical activity.\n\nScenes from a Habsburg Queen's Coronation\n\nNYPL, Spencer Collection\n\nScenes from a Habsburg Queen's Coronation\n\nNYPL, Spencer Collection"
