The wedding took place at Schloß Wallsee near Amstetten in Austria. The couple has seven children:\n\n* Princess Maria-Theresia of Bavaria (b. 1956)\n\n* Prince Franz-Josef of Bavaria (b. 1957)\n\n* Princess Elisabeth of Bavaria (b. 1959)\n\n* Prince Wolfgang of Bavaria (b. 1960)\n\n* Princess Benedikta of Bavaria (b. 1961)\n\n* Prince Christoph of Bavaria (b. 1962)\n\n* Princess Gisela of Bavaria (b. 1964)\n\nLater life\n\nThe prince is a Grand Prior of the Bavarian Order of Saint George, Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert and a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.Because the current head of the Royal House of Bavaria, Duke Franz and his younger brother Max have no male offsprings, Rasso's brother Prince Ludwig will become the next in line in the Bavarian Succession. Prince Rasso is currently 7th.\n\nReferences\n\n* Die Wittelsbacher. Geschichte unserer Familie. Adalbert, Prinz von Bayern. Prestel Verlag, München, 1979"
