        "text": "Her slender figure dressed in an ethereal tulle gown, bare shoulders, and a cascade of long hair adorned by twenty-seven star-shaped brooches, as depicted by Xaver Winterhalter from the back, is how we all picture Elisabeth I, Empress of Austria, née Duchess Elizabeth Amalie Eugenie from the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach and better known as Sisi.\n\nThe painting crystallised the myth of her beauty. It also proved her extensive influence as a style-maker. Aristocratic families across Europe promptly began commissioning star-shaped jewellery – including Queen Alexandra, who asked Garrard to craft seven 8-pointed star brooches. Sisi also loved pearls and rubies, and jewellers worked tirelessly to source the gems and find new, original ways to set them in jewels.\n\nRead More\n\nWho was Empress Elisabeth of Austria? Discover the captivating story of the tragic ‘beauty queen’\n\nThe ill-fated Empress Elisabeth ‘Sissi’ of Austria, who died on 10 September 1898, has had her story retold countless times on screen. But what is the truth behind the period dramas?\n\nIt is the splendour of the court Sisi and her husband the Emperor Franz Joseph reigned upon that is celebrated in ‘Vienna 1900: An Imperial and Royal Collection’, Sotheby’s upcoming auction on November 5 in Geneva. A showcase that proffers over 200 jewels replete with history from the most prestigious royal houses of Europe all linked to the Habsburgs. It is a unique collection composed of family heirlooms, gifts from the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph and jewels cleverly and daringly saved from the Soviets.\n\nThrough the splendid jewellery of Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria (1870-1902), Archduchess Maria Immaculata of Austria-Tuscany (1878-1968), Archduchess Maria Therese of Austria-Teschen (1845-1927), Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (1861-1948) and Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma (1870-1899) we glimpse into the history and style of the Houses of Habsburg, Bourbon-Parma, Bourbon-Two Sicilies and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha who wielded power throughout Central Europe.\n\nRead More\n\nThe fascinating history of the Vladimir Tiara as it sparkles in the new portrait of the Queen\n\nThe Vladimir Tiara is worn by Queen Elizabeth II in the Cecil Beaton portrait released to mark the first anniversary of her death. The glittering piece was smuggled out of Russia by a British antiques dealer after the assassination of the Tsar and was later bought by Elizabeth II’s grandmother, Queen Mary\n\nStored in a bank vault since the 1940s, the jewels were brought back to light by Philipp von Württemberg, who, through his company Philipp Württemberg Art Advisory GmbH, helped organise the auction at Sotheby’s. The opening of every trunk and box left von Württemberg speechless, as the jewels shone in pristine condition with their story and whereabouts detailed in small hand-written notes accompanying them.\n\nA devant de corsage – a piece of jewellery worn on the centre panel of the bodice of a dress – larger than the palm of a hand in the shape of a floral wreath paved with diamonds is one of the most noteworthy items. It was given to the Duchess of Württemberg, née Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Teschen (1845-1927) – the daughter of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, a military advisor to Habsburg Emperor Francis Joseph I, and Princess Hildegard of Bavaria – on her marriage to Philipp, Duke of Württemberg (1838-1917) in 1865.\n\nRead More\n\nThe tragic history of the missing Queen Nazli of Egypt Art Deco Diamond Tiara\n\nCreated for a royal wedding, the Queen Nazli of Egypt Art Deco Diamond Tiara was later tarnished by a tragic turn of events\n\nThere is also a button-shaped pearl brooch embraced by diamonds holding two round brilliant-cut diamonds and a more prominent drop pearl, which the Duchess of Württemberg wears in a photograph as the central ornament of a lace ribbon tied to her neck. The drop-shaped pearl weighs approximately 38.55 carats, thus very similar in size and style to the famed Marie-Antoinette pearl, which sold at Sotheby's in 2018 for 36.4 million Swiss Francs – or staggering £32.7 million.\n\nBoth the devant de corsage and the pearl brooch have an estimate between $300,000 – 500,000. They come in fitted cases signed by Viennese jeweller Emil Biedermann (1830-1900), who continued the business founded by his grandfather Michael Lazar Biedermann (1769-1843), and was a regular supplier of the Habsburgs. There are also several jewels created by the Viennese jewellery house Köchert, a stalwart of the Habsburg family.\n\nA diamond necklace made of a suite of flowers centred with rubies and a matching brooch made for Archduchess Margarete Sophie of Austria, Duchess of Württemberg (1870-1902), the niece of Emperor Franz Joseph of Habsburg, revisits a design Köchert first explored in remodelling a ruby and diamond parure for the emperor. The necklace (with rubies weighing a total of approximately 6.00 – 8.00 carats) is offered with its original drawing showing how to transform the necklace into a tiara and several brooches. Köchert explores a different style in a tiara conceived as two diamond-studded ribbons interspersed by rubies and topped by round-cut diamonds converging into a central knot with a ruby at its heart and three round-cut diamonds springing from the top. This tiara was part of the estate of Isabella, Duchess of Württemberg (1871-1904), and has an estimated value of $200,000 - 400,000.\n\nRead More\n\nShow me the Monet: Hôtel Lambert to sell its princely treasures\n\nOne of the most famous buildings in Paris is to enter a new chapter – and all its priceless pieces are to be auctioned by Sotheby’s. But what’s going, going…?\n\nAnother tiara designed by Köchert features several large drop pearls encircled by ethereal strands of cushion-shaped diamonds (estimated $300,000 - 500,000) and it is believed to be a gift from the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph to Archduchess Maria Immaculata of Austria-Tuscany (1878-1968) for her wedding to Robert, Duke of Württemberg (1873-1947).\n\nThere is also a five-strand natural pearl necklace with an elaborate diamond clasp, attributed to Köchert, from the late 19th century, which belonged to Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Archduchess of Austria-Tuscany (1844-1899) and was inherited by her daughter Archduchess Maria Immaculata of Austria-Tuscany, Duchess of Württemberg (1878-1968).\n\nAccording to a family legend recounted by Von Württemberg, Empress Sisi nicknamed Archduchess Maria Immaculata of Austria-Tuscany ‘Perlenfischerin’ (pearl-fisher), as she often received pearls as a gift – suggesting that these were jewels that could elicit the envy of the empress who set the style agenda of the time.\n\nThe Vienna 1900 collection also comprises three diamond star-shaped brooches echoing those made by Köchert and famously worn in the hair by the Empress Sisi in the fabled Winterhalter’s portrait. They were made by Wilhelm Haarstrick, who worked with Köchert when the firm was making Sisi’s stars in the 1860s but also worked independently.\n\nRead More\n\nMy mind-boggling day as a guest of Jacques Garcia, ‘the holy grail of French taste’, at his home, the Château du Champ de Bataille\n\nJacques Garcia was behind ‘that’ Sicilian Monastery in The White Lotus. Ahead of some of his most exquisite, Marie Antoinette-approved pieces being auctioned by Sotheby’s, Deputy Features Editor Annabel Sampson met ‘la crème de Francaise’ for the lunch of a lifetime\n\nAn important number of jewels, including an notable sapphire pendant which belonged to Tsaritsa Eleonore (Tsar Ferdinand I’s second wife) were saved from the Red Army in 1946 in Bulgaria by Princess Eudoxie and her sister-in-law Giovanna of Savoy, wife of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria. Taking advantage of her guardian’s sturdy night’s sleep, Princess Eudoxie dug up the jewellery box she had previously hidden in the garden of her house in 1944 when the Soviets entered her country and placed them in a wheelbarrow covered with books. The day after, she asked permission to take the books to her sister-in-law Giovanna. A few days later, the two ladies were allowed to leave the country with Giovanna’s children. After a long Odyssey through Eastern Europe, Egypt and Italy, Eudoxie reached her sister Nadezhda in Germany – and the family treasure was saved.\n\nBut there are plenty of men’s accessories, too, like a pocket watch by Patek Philippe with a certificate from 1898, cigarette boxes, tie-pins and cufflinks. Von Württemberg recounted how he was astounded to open a box containing emerald cufflinks and read on the hand-written note inside it that they were a gift from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdul Hamid II (1842-1918) to Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (1861-1948) made in 1898. The cufflinks ended up in the Württemberg family through Ferdinand I’s daughter, Princess Nadezhda of Bulgaria (1899-1958), who married Duke Albrecht Eugen of Württemberg (1939-1975).\n\nAndres White Correal, Sotheby’s deputy chairman, says this is one of the best collections of royal jewellery ever to come to auction. He is visibly moved by the touching stories enshrined in these unique pieces, often stirring intense emotions in prospective buyers. He adds, ‘I have seen tears be shed in the presence of historical jewels.’ In which case, let us be prepared for an eye-wateringly grand sale come 5 November – you can’t say you hadn’t been warned.\n\nVienna 1900: An Imperial and Royal Collection will take place at Sotheby’s Geneva on 6 November 2023"
