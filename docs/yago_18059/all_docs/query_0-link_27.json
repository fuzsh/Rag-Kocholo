        "text": "For other people named Maria Theresa of Austria, see Maria Theresa of Austria (disambiguation).\n\nMaria Theresa of Austria (21 March 1801 – 12 January 1855) was born an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany. In 1817 she married and became the Queen of Sardinia. She was the wife of King Charles Albert of Sardinia and a daughter of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Luisa of Naples and Sicily. She was named after her double great grandmother Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nContents\n\n1 Birth and childhood\n\n2 Marriage and children\n\n3 End of life\n\n4 Issue\n\n5 Genealogy\n\n6 Genealogy chart\n\n7 Ancestory\n\n8 Titles, styles, honours and arms\n\n8.1 Titles and styles\n\n9 See also\n\nBirth and childhood\n\nMaria Theresia Franziska Josepha Johanna Benedikta (German) was a member of the Tuscan branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Bohemia, Hungary, and Tuscany by birth. She was born in Vienna during the exile of her parents and their many children, due to Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Tuscany. Her father was Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and her mother was Princess Luisa of Naples and Sicily, who died giving birth to a stillborn son one year after Maria Theresa's birth.\n\nAfter the Restoration of 1814, Ferdinando III was made Elector of the secularized archbishopric Salzburg and the family moved to Würzburg.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nMaria Theresa married in Florence on 30 September 1817 Charles Albert of Sardinia (Paris, 29 October 1798 - Porto, 28 July 1849), and a wedding mass was celebrated on 2 October in Florence Cathedral. In Italian her name was Maria Teresa Francesca Giuseppa Giovanna Benedicta.\n\nIn March 1820 an heir to the throne was born followed by two more children the later of which died in infancy.\n\nIn 1824 Charles Albert was recognised as heir to the throne by Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia. He and Maria Theresa became king and queen in 1831, when his successor Charles Felix of Sardinia died without issue.\n\nEnd of life\n\nAfter the death of her husband in 1849 in Oporto, the Queen mother Maria Theresa stopped appearing in public and even returned to Italy in 1851, where she died four years later, in Turin. She was buried in the Basilica of Superga in Turin.\n\nA convinced Catholic and conservative, she had a great influence on her eldest son on the new Italian throne.\n\nIssue\n\nVittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso (14 March 1820 – 9 January 1878) married Archduchess Maria Adelaide of Austria and had issue; would become the first King of a united Italy;\n\nFerdinando Maria Alberto Amedeo Filiberto Vincenzo (15 November 1822 – 10 February 1855) married Princess Elisabeth of Saxony and had issue; Duke of Genoa;\n\nMaria Cristina (4 July 1826 – 25 July 1827) died in infancy.\n\nGenealogy\n\nEven among the frequently tangled genealogies of European nobility, the ancestry of Maria Theresa of Tuscany was unusual. In fact, her parents had the same four grandparents, so they were double cousins when they spoused: this practice of alliances between cousins that was still common at that time, given that the families (and notably the parents and grandparents of Maria Theresa) had a lot of children, and this avoided to split too much the benefit of heirs though alliances and their descendance, and the multiplication of nobility titles to satisfy the various claims by descendants.\n\nAs a consequence, her grandparents consisted of two brother/sister pairs. Her paternal grandfather, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, was the brother of her maternal grandmother, Maria Caroline of Austria. Matching that combination, her paternal grandmother, Maria Louisa of Spain, was the sister of her maternal grandfather, Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. As a consequence she only had four great-grandparents rather than the usual eight. (Although not so unusual, it may be worth pointing out that her grandmothers and great-grandmothers, as well as her mother or herself and her sister, or her daughter were all surnamed \"Maria\".)\n\nGenealogy chart\n\nFrancis I,\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Maria Theresa,\n\nArchduchess\n\nof Austria Charles III,\n\nKing\n\nof Spain Maria Amalia,\n\nPrincess\n\nof Saxony Leopold II,\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Maria Louisa,\n\nInfanta\n\nof Spain Ferdinand I,\n\nKing\n\nof the Two Sicilies Maria Carolina,\n\nArchduchess\n\nof Austria Ferdinand III,\n\nGrand Duke\n\nof Tuscany Luisa,\n\nPrincess\n\nof Naples and Sicily Carolina Ferdinanda Teresa,\n\nArchduchess\n\nof Austria Francesco Leopoldo,\n\nArchduke\n\nof Austria Leopold II,\n\nGrand Duke\n\nof Austria Maria Luisa Giuseppa\n\nCristina Rosa,\n\nArchduchess\n\nof Austria Charles Albert,\n\nKing\n\nof Sardinia Maria Theresa,\n\nArchduchess\n\nof Austria Unnamed stillborn,\n\nArchduke\n\nof Austria Victor Emmanuel II,\n\nKing\n\nof Italy Ferdinand,\n\nDuke\n\nof Genoa Maria Cristina,\n\nPrincess\n\nof Savoy\n\nAncestory\n\nAncestors of Maria Theresa of Austria (1801–1855)\n\n16.
