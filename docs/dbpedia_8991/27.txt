What Are the Early Warning Signs of Termites

Termites tend to burrow under your Summitville, NY, home, so termite tubes found in the mud and dirt around your home’s foundation are good things to look out for. Hollow sounding wood is a clear-cut and classic alarm bell in termite detection. While termite bites are possible, they seldom happen. Look for strange patterns in your woodwork, too, as these almost certainly indicate the presence of termites.
