Sliding Scale Treatment

Based on the most recent data available, it is estimated that approximately 20-25% of all addiction treatment centers offer sliding scale fees. This means that nearly one-quarter of rehab facilities adjust their treatment costs based on an individual's income and ability to pay. This is a significant step towards making addiction treatment more accessible to individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

It is important to note that these figures may vary depending on the specific region or state, and the type of treatment facility being considered. For instance, private treatment facilities are more likely to offer sliding scale options compared to government-funded or non-profit facilities. Additionally, certain types of treatment, such as outpatient or residential care, may have a higher prevalence of sliding scale programs.
