It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE ji MANUAL OF STYLE FOR rSE IN COMPOSITION AND PROOF READING PREPARED UNDER THE DIRECTION OFTHE PIBLIC PRINTER 100 t Inflexible rules for style in all works can not be given, but for the general work of the Government Printing Office the rules herein contained will be observed. All persons connected with the typographical divisions of this office are requested to preserve this book and study carefully the rules and suggestions offered for their guidance. Department editors are requested when preparing work for this office to make their copy conform as nearly as possible to the style here presented, and to specify fully any general deviation therefrom that may be desired.

Names of types (nonpareil, brevier, long primer, etc.) are used in this Mantal, although the point system is coming into general use in the office and is apparently destined to entirely supersede the old system. 2 ^ CONTENTS.

Authors are advised to so prepare their copy that it can be clearly understood by the printer. Nothing should be left for conjecture. Measurable perfection can be secured by first transcribing copy on the typewriter, and before releasing it for publication giving it as careful revision as is afterwards given proof sheets. In the end this will not only save time, but Department printing funds frequently exhausted in making author's corrections in proof will be available for other work. Typewritten copy (when a good quality of paper is used) is always preferable to manuscript, but all copy should be plain to produce good work. The following points are offered as suggestions which, if heeded, will enable this office to achieve the best results: 1. All paragraphs should be clearly marked on copy, thus avoiding vexatious mis- prints due to overrunning. 2. Photographs, drawings, cuts, etc., for illustrations should accompany manu- script. Each should bear the name of the publication to which it belongs, together with the figure or plate number, and necessary titles or legends for the same should be inserted at the proper place in copy. A complete list of plates and figures should always accompany the manuscript. 3. When a work is made up of several parts, or papers, a carefully prepared sched- ule of the desired arrangement should l)e forwarded with the manuscript. 4. Proper names and technical terms should be plainly and carefully written, using CAPITAL letters if necessary, and each should be verified before the copy is sent to the printer. 5. Details of capitalization and punctuation may be safely left to the printers and proof readers. It is part of their profession; they make a study of the subject, and wull generally meet the author's taste. 6. Write only on one side of the paper. When printed matter covering more than one side of a sheet is used as copy, a duplicate should be furnished; otherwise much trouble is caused in cutting. 7. When, as an afterthought, new matter making more than a line is inserted, it should be written on a separate sheet and the place for its insertion clearly indicated. 8. Galley proofs will be furnished when desired. It is important that all correc- tions be made on the first proofs; later ones should be used only for purposes of verification. 9. Corrections in-stereotype or electrotype plates usually do more harm than good. They weaken the plate and render new errors probable through damaged letters. 10. Authors and compilers are requested to direct those handling their manuscript to transmit the same to the Printing Office in flat form — never to roll the manuscript if it can be avoided. 5 MANUAL OF STYLE. afterwaids canyon aftward downward aluminum draft, draftlngr, etc. asbestos embed backward employee When necessary to depart from the Manual of Style the copy preparers will give instructions to the compositors and readers. Instructions will be given as to orthography, compounding, capitalization, and punctuation in scientific and technical work. Revisers will promptly notify the foreman of the proof room when variations from the Manual are being marked by Department readers. ORTHOGRAPHY. [See also Follow— Fol. lit., p. 33; Geological ages, etc., p. 13.] Follow Webster's International Dictionary in spelling and divisions. Observe, however, the following forms: Filipino shellac forward stayed (p. p.) farther (distance) toward further (not distance) upward sloyd wharves The following authorities, in the order given, will govern the spelling of geographic names: ^ Decisions of the United States Board on Geographic Names. United States Postal Guide. International Postal Guide (Dictionnaire des Bureaux de Poste). Lippincott's Gazetteer of the World. Rand, McNally & Co.'s Atlas. INDIAN NAMES. [See also Spelling of Indian names, p. 64.] Omit spaces and hyphens in Indian geographic names; in other than geographic names, use spaces in place of hyphens. In court work and **fol.\" matter, follow copy as to spelling and the use of the hyphen or space. COMPOUND AVORDS. [See also Compounds, p. 26; Percentage, p. 27.] Follow Webster's International Dictionary generally in the use or omission of the hyphen or space between words. (See also Vocabulary op double wori:s, p. 43.) Compound adjectives generally take the hyphen: A 12-inch main, 75- horsepower engine, asked-for opinion, light-green color, etc. ; but omit the hyphen in common school, high school, and public school when used adjectively. Care must always be taken not to confuse the qualifying word with the subject word; for instance, a shoemaker can be a German shoemaker, and, if he makes wooden shoes, a wooden- shoe maker. ^Ir. So-and-so. 7 OBTHOGBAPBT. 8 : N V ::/•: • Fraclions,*when'speJled, will be compounded: One twenty-first, one-fifth, eighty- { ;©i]i3eppethj[iiKireiitRs, on]e one-hundredth, the one-hundredth part, one one hundred •'an^tw'^entteth;- t^^^^^so Fractions, p. 27.) The following rule governing work of the United States Geological Survey will be used generally for similar terms in other work: *'Use the hyphen in specific rock names — i. e., the names of definite rock types; but when the first word has an adjec- tive sense, and the meaning would not be changed if an adjective were used (e. g., clay slate =^ argillaceous slate), the words should not be joined.

ABBREVIATIONS (see also Christian names, p. 18; Months, p. 20) Units of quantity to the right of reading columns (lower-(»sed) and over figure columns (capitalized) will be spelled where possible. Where the space avail- able demands a contraction, use the following forms: dolls., dwt., galls., lbs., oz. (for ounce or ounces), bbls., cwt., yds., ft, in.

Months will be abbreviated when day is given; but in box heads only when so prepared. (See also Date columns, p. 23. ) BOX HEADS Letters are not to be filed where crowding is necessary. To be solid and the words centered in the box except when the column is 10 ems or more in width and the matter makes 3 lines or more, in which case make a hanging indention. Run-up heads are indented an en space at the beginning: of the line and bear off an en space where reaching the rule at the top, and if they make 2 lines, center the second; if 3 lines, make a hanging indention. The minimum depth to be 3 ems. To run across wherever practicable; if necessary to run up, reduce to minimum depth. Avoid running up over reading and date columns. In single heads of 2 lines or more and heads having double or a greater number of boxes bear off an en space above and below; in tables set in ouarto or a wider measure, tables set in brevier with nonpareil box heads, and full-quadded tables' use an em space above and below. Where a single box exceeds the depth of a double or triple box place the extra space in the lowermost box. Where a head is composed of double boxes, or a greater number, the greatest number of lines in the top box will control the depth of all the top boxes; so also in each of the other boxes. Occasionally the top box of a triple box head may be of such depth as to make a better appearance by allowing its bottom rule to align with the bottom rule of the second box. In boxes containing 2 lines the first line to be the longer where possible, but do not sacrifice good appearance by dividing short words or making 2-letter divisions in wide columns. In parallel tables where a box head is divided, repeat for each page. Spell the word * ''number,*' referring to quantity or things, in box heads, whert? possible. Where necessary to abbreviate, or where used in connection w ith serial figures, use \"No.\" BRACES Straight-line braces on en body are to be used, and to go on right of rule where possible. CENTER, FLUSH, AND SUB HEADS (see also Date columns, p. 23) Use a full blank line above all center heads. Where a parallel dash, runover, etc. , in another column furnishes a blank space above the head do not add an extra blank. 23 TABTJLAB WOBK CENTER, FLUSH, AND SUB HEADS— Continued. Where the center head will clear the reading matter below, and there are leaders, use a line of en quads only; if no leaders below and the center head will clear at least an en space, omit blank, but if it clears less than an en space, use an en-quad line. Otherwise use full blank below. Use a colon after a flush head and an en^ dash after each head subordinate thereto. The copy preparer will indicate when to do otherwise. CONTINUED HEADS Continued heads over tables must be condensed into one line where possible. ^'CONTINUED\" Omit period or 'colon after a center, flush, or sub head where the word ** con- tinued'* is used, and always use a 1-em dash between it and the head. If the head is all small caps, use a lower-case **c.\" DASHES Do not carry dashes in reading or date columns. Parallel dashes will be used in all cases where necessary to cut off from figures following. DATE COLUMNS Always abbreviate months in columns cast to 5, 7, or TJems (this latter for inside columns) and bear off from the rule an en space, placing the remaining space between the month and the day; where the year is used put an en comma only between it and the day. Omit the period at end where a 5 or 7 em column is the last one of the table. Where the year is centered over dates use a full blank above and no space below. Where a column is composed of dates only and is cast wider than 7i ems, spell out months unless otherwise indicated, or where necessary to save overruns. Where not follow^ed by leaders and consisting of years only and some of the lines have a double year, center each in the column, in the following manner: i 1898 1899-1900 I 1901-2 Date columns are not classed as reading columns. '♦DITTO,\" USE OF - Never use **do.\" in the first line under a center head or under a line of leaders; but it can be used under a blank space, except as limited. Only use **do.\" in reading and date columns. Capitalize when not preceded by leaders. In the last column of a table do not use leaders with \"Do.\" and capitalize. In columns less than 6 ems in width use IJ ems of quads (in addition to en quad used for bearing off) or 2 ems of leaders, as may be required, before the **ao.\" In columns of 6 ems and over, use 2 ems of quads (in addition to en quad used for bearing off) or 2 J ems of leaders. In first columns, where flush headings are used with indentions under them, proportionate allowance must be made for those indentions, which will generally be indicated by the copy preparer. Where *Mo.\" is used in reading columns under units of quantity, bear off a 2-em leader on right. DOLLAR MARK To be placed close to figure, and only repeated under cross rules. DOUBLE-UP TABLES Repeat a center, flush, or sub head, adding ** continued,\" if the matter under it breaks. Use an en space only on each side of the parallel rule. EN-QUADDED TABLES Use en quads in runovers (copy preparers will give instructions when change is- desired); scabbard will not be allowed. Omit en quads above and below dashes, except where rules are used instead of dashes. TABTJLAB WORK 24 FIGURE COLUMNS (see also Fractions, below) Always bear off the longest line of figures at least an en space from rule, where it can be done. Where crowded and only a few figures will touch, close up on the left; if more space be needed, close up on the right. Where necessary to close up on the right in one figure column, do the same with the other figure columns. Double columns of figures in a single column connected by an en dash, the word *'to,'' or similar connecting word, the en dashes or words to be rang^. Plus and minus marks, where occurring at left of figures, are to be ranged. Kange all words occurring in figure columns with figures on right; also capital- ize and use a thin period. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES Footnotes to be solid and to have the same abbreviations as are used in the table. In a series of short footnotes range the reference marks on the right and the first letters of the notes. Italic superior letters are to be used for references unless otherwise indicated by copy preparer. In figure columns footnote references are to be placed at left; but when figure columns are treated as reading columns place references at right. Use period between an abbreviation and a reference mark: St. Louis, Mo.« do.ft FRACTIONS Common fractions will be set against rule unless otherwise indicated. Decimals: Copy preparers will indicate when ciphers and points are to he omitted. Always align decimal points, except in columns containing mixed numbers having irregular decimals; that is, where one number w^ould have a decimal of one figure, the next four figures, and so on, one representing pounds, the next dollars, and the next a percentage, etc. ITALICS Units of quantity, etc., where not in box heads and placed over figure columns to be italics, and to be used only at beginning of a new table or at the head of a continued page, and to drop down on the figures if there is a colon or dash side head; otherwise clear. Names of vessels and scientific names of genera and species to be roman unless otherwise directed. LEADERS Unless specially directed otherwise, continue leaders across entire width of table, except where the last column is a reading column or a 5 or a 7 em date column, in which case omit the leaders from that column. Also omit leaders in a 5 or a 7 em date column where it is the first column of a table. LEADING FROM TOP OR BOTTOM LINES Where there is only one reading column, lead from the bottom; if more than one, from the top, omitting leaders in the runover line. Date columns are not classified as reading columns in connection with leading from top line. In parallel tables, where the lines are numbered on the outside of each page, lead from the top. READING COLUMNS (see also En commas and periods, p. 28) Are always to be borne off an en space from rule. Indention from rule means so many ems in addition to the en space used for bearing off. Where the last word in a leader line runs close to the rule, use an en leader if space permits; if not, use a thin space, but never use a period excepting where a reference mark follows an abbreviation. If a 3-em space will go between the last word and the leader, thin-space so as to get in an en leader. Numerical expressions will be expressed in figures, even at the beginning of a sentence: 241 days from Dec. 1 ; trains 3 times a day. Overruns: Unless otherwise indicated, overruns will be 1 em hanging indention. Ordinal numbers followed by leaders, also figures having a total in a stub or reading column, are to be ranged on right. TABLES IN RULES Copy preparers will give instructions concerning box heads, bearing off from rule, aashes, leaders, etc., for tables inclosed in rules. 25 LEADEB WOBK LEADER WORK. To have the same style as tables in the following particulars: \"Continued \" (the use of); flush and sub heads; indentions; numerical expressions in reading columns; ranging words in figure columns and figures in reading columns; units of quantity at right in reading columns. Width of figure column to be an en space more than the longest line of figures; bat no column less than 2 ems. When the last column is reading matter run leaders close up. Nam^ of vessels to be in italics. DASHES Use parallel dashes in figure columns where necessary to cut off from figures fol- lowing. In leaded leader work omit lead above and below dashes. DATE COLUMNS The same style as in tables, except that a thin period and en space is used to sepa- rate from item on the right. DOLLAR MARK Use only at beginning of each statement and first line of double-up matter or at the head of a continued statement. FLUSH AND SUB HEADS Are not to run into figure columns. UNITS OF QUANTITY Where a column is composed of a quantity of one kind and it is desired to use a head, it will be in nonpareil roman centered over the figure column. The examples below show the style to be observed where there is a short side head to the left (note the lead under nonpareil head in solid matter) : Pennsylvania Railroad : Tons. Freight carried 221, OOO Baltimore and Ohio Railroad: Freight carried — Tons. In the month of May 150,000 W^here there is no side head : Tons. Freight carried bv the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the month of May 371, 500 USE OF FIGURES. It is impossible to give definite rules that will govern in all cases as to what should go in figures and what should be spelled out. General rules which will serve as a guide follow. Always spell out figures beginning a sentence, except in tables, ordinal numbers at the beginning of paragraphs or sentences in certain cases, and complex numbers beginning questions or answers in testimony. Ordinal numbers: 1. The earth is round. (2) *'Thesundo move.\" But when copy indicates ''1st,\" etc., spell: First. The moon is not green cheese. In testimony : Q. In what year was that?— A. 1876. Q. 18767-A. Yes, sir. Q. What was the amount involved?— A. $101.50. Q. How much was the sum? — A. Five (or fifteen, or sixty-seven) dollars. FIGTTEES 26 Amounts or numbers larger than 1,000, if spelled, are expressed thus: One thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars (not eighteen hundred and fifty dollars), one thousand two hundred tons (not twelve hundred tons). Spell out numbers mentioned casually, or by way of illustration, or in connection with serious and dignified subjects: In nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand. Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute. The twelve Apostles. The three Graces. The nine Muses. The seven wise men of (jreece. AGE My age is 52 years and 6 months; a boy 6 years old; 3-year-old colt; 3-months- old child; wine 8 years old (but a boy about six years old; w4ne four or five years old — where indefinite and isolated, spell out). BONDS OR STOCKS Gold is 109; Metropolitan Railroad, 109; 5-20 bonds; 10-40 bonds; 7.30 bonds. 3.65 bonds; 4J per cent bonds; 3 per cent bonds; 3J percents; 4 percents. Where the word ** bonds\" does not follow the designating expression, spell out, as five-twenties, ten-forties, three-sixty-fives, four-and-a-halrs, threes, etc. COMPOUNDS (see also Fractions and Money, p. 27) Use figures for such compound terms as a |-inch board, a i-pound weight, a 25-story building (where the figure does not make two words, and is isolated, spell, as a two-story house); a 25-cent piece, a 5-franc piece; a 2- foot rule, 10- horsepower engine, 25-candlepower lamp, 16-hundred weight load, etc. Spell out such terms as a two-dollar bill, etc., except w4iere the figure makes two words, as a $25 suit of clothes. DATES June 29, A. D. 1882; December 6, 1846; the 1st of January, 1883; June 12; the 5th instant; the 20th day of March; the Ist (day) of the month; the last of April or the first of May; July 4, 1776, was the great day which gave to the world the celebrated Declaration of Independence, and now our Fourth of July is something to be remembered by all patriotic Americans; 4th of July claims. Spell such expressions as the early seventies, it occurred in the eighties. When two consecutive years are mtended, set: 1875-76, 1801-2, except 1900-1901; when more than two consecutive years are intended: 1875-1879, 1895-1904; when two or more distinct years are intended: 1894, 1895; 1873, 1876; 1888, 1891,1894. DECIMALS (see also Fractions, pp. 24, 27) Supply cipher \\v'hen there is no unit, as 0.25; 20 ounces of silver, 0.900 fine; except where referring to caliber of small arms, as .30 caliber, .45-caliber Spring- field rifle, distinguishing, however, where used to describe the length of a gun, as a 6-inch rapid-fire rifle, 50 calibers. DEFINITE ENUMERATIONS Use figures for all definite enumerations of weights and measures, and such as the following: There were 20 males and 25 females, 45 in all; 6 horses, 5 cows, 26 head of sheep; 25 bulletins, containing 352 pages; but when complicated spell, as twenty-five 6-inch guns, five 24-pounders, two J-inch boards, five 5-cent pieces. In the latter forms figures should not be used for both expressions. When the nature of the matter is not statistical, spell out isolated numbers lees than 10; also when referred to indefinitely, as between two and three hundred horses, thirty or forty pages, forty-odd people, etc. DEGREES, ETC. Longitude 77° 04^06^^ E., latitude 49° 26^ 14^^ N.; a polariscopic test of 85°; 45.5° below zero; an angle of 57°: 4°, 8° (quarto and octavo), f°; 3^ 5^^ (3 feet 5 inches); 25^.5 or 25.5'' as written. DIMENSIONS Use the form 8 by 12 inches; but 8X12 inches or 8X12^'' (as indicated in copy) may be used in leader work, tables, or \"fol.\" 27 FIGURES FRACTIONS (see also Compounds and Decimals, p. 26) Spell out a common fraction where isolated, as one one-hundredth, two one hundred and twenty-sixths; i when marked to be spelled, one-fourth; a board three-fourths inch thick (using singular form for unit of measurement, etc., when less than one). Use figures for decimals, as iron 0.625 inch thick; it cost $0.3346 per pound; scrap, at 0.75 cent per pound. MONEY (see also Compounds, p. 26) At $3 per 200 pounds; 75 cents apiece; 2.5 francs per yard; $0.7525 per ounce. Spell out \\^hen referred to in a general way, as one or two millions, \"I would not contribute one dollar to such a purpose;\" but this is not to be construed as meaning round numbers. PERCENTAGE 12 per cent, 25.5 per cent; but one-half of 1 per cent. Never use hyphen in such expressions as 12 per cent interest, etc. POPULATION The population of Chicago is 1,800,000, of whom 250,000 are voters; a hamlet of 18 persons. But when the nature of the matter is not statistical, spell out num- bers under 10; or where referred to indefinitely, as the population is forty or fifty thousand; there were thirty -five or forty persons in the town. SCRIPTURAL TEXTS Genesis xv, 24; II Samuel viii, 9-13; St. Matthew vii, 5. SERIAL NUMBERS Section 1234, No. 54321; 1536 Ninth street NW.; paragraph 246, page 15, volume '6 (or Volume VI, as written); clerk of class 4; H. R. 12345, Report No. 4321, Document No. 1:^3; Bulletin 46; and all such terms. Where spelled out use the form section twelve hundred and thirty-four; but wheAeven multiples of one thousand occur, use the word \"thousand,\" as sec- tion wo thousand and four (not twenty hundred and four); paragraph seven thousand and sixty-nine. Spell out when used as a name, as One hundred and fifty-fifth street, Four:and- a-half street. One hundred and ninth Indiana Regiment, Fourth Ward, etc. (See also Numbers used as names, p. 14. ) SPECIFIC GRAVITY Use the period, as 1.100, 0.980. SUPERIORS AND INFERIORS Use superiors with reference letters, as A^, A^, or a^ a^j etc. Use inferiors in chemical formulas, as Al^Oj, and always close up, using no spaces. TIME 4.30 p. m. (use period to separate hours and minutes) ; 4 o'clock and 30 minutes p. m.; half-past 4. In scientific work, 4*^ 30\"'; 4^.5 or 4.5** as indicated. Spell out thirty days' notice; he worked fifty years as a journeyman; it lasted three hours and twenty minutes, etc. VOTES, BALLOTS, ETC. 75 votes; 50 ballots; 300 voters; 167 Democrats; 14 majority. But spell out when referred to indefinitely, as twenty or twervty-five votes. MISCELLANEOUS. ACCENTS Omit the dieresis in such words as aerate, cooperation, preemption, reexamine, zoology, etc. Use accents in foreign names and words, unless otherwise directed. The following is a partial list of words in common use in which accented letters occur: attach^:* en arriere fa^-ade rale charge d'affaires en <^chelon materiel regime confrere en r^gle m^l^e r6sum6 coup d'etat entree n4e r61e coup de gr&ce entrep6t proems verbal r61e d'^quipage d6bris expose prot6g<5 seiior MISCELLANEOUS 28 CENTER LINES Copy preparers will take full responsibility for uniformity in center lines, and no changes are to be made without their consent. Avoid, where possible, the division of words in center lines making 2 lines only. Use an en space between words in small-cap and cap lines, and two 3-em spaces where an extended face is used. Cap, small-cap, and cap-and-small-cap center lines are to be separated from text by a slug one size less than type used for the center line. CITATIONS AND CREDITS In text, citations and credits are to be sentences and in parentheses where occur- ring at end of a sentence, except where page only is given, in which case ut^e lower-case letter and place period outside. Credits where centered to be in brackets. See also various headings under Abbreviations, page 18. Note the following forms: (18 [not 18th] Statutes at Large, p. 25; IV [not IVth] William and Mary, p. 46; 126 [not 126th] United States Reports.) DIVISIONS Frequent divisions of words are undesirable, but do not avoid them entirely at the expense of uniform spacing. Do not divide compound words except at the compounding hyphen in any but extreme cases. Divisions at the ends of three adjacent lines will not be passed by readers except in extreme cases or in narrow measure. Divisions on syllables of two letters should be made but rarely. Never divide the last word of a paragraph if it can be avoided; overrun if neces- sary. The last line of a paragraph should contain at least a four-letter word. Avoid, by overrunning, the use of a dash at the beginning of a line. ELLIPSIS, MARKS OF In document measure, \"line of stars\" means 7 asterisks indented 2 ems at each end of the line, dividing the remaining space evenly between the asterisks; but in case two or more sizes of type are used on a page indent long primer 2 ems, brevier 2 J ems, and nonpareil 3J ems. In other than document measure the copy preparers will indicate the number of asterisks and the indention, which latter will be uniform in all cases. If 3 asterisks are used, separate by an em space; if periods are used instead of asterisks, separate by en spaces. EN COMMAS AND PERIODS Compositors are to get instructions from foreman when to use en commas and periods in indexes and reading columns of tables. They are only to be used in matter set solid. FOOTNOTES Italic superior letters will be used for references, unless otherwise indicated. Use 2 leads above and below the rule; and two leads to separate from tabular matter. See also various headings under Abbreviations, page 18; Footnotes and kef- ERENCEs, page 24. FORMS, SHAPES, ETC. In illustrating certain forms or shapes, as T rails, etc., use caps of case 239 in long-primer text, case 238 in brevier, and case 237 in nonpareil; but for the expression I beam use cap of case 9 in long primer, case 8 in brevier, and case 7 in nonpareil. Use a roman cap letter for X ray. INDEXES In indexes where leaders are used and the page folios overrun, retain only the first folio number in the leader line; but where necessary to save an overrun, figures may be run back to within an em leader of the words. When the folios overrun- ning make two or more lines, indent evenly not less than 7 ems on the left in full measure and 3 J ems in half measure (but where there are clearances indent folios 2 ems more than the matter above or below it) , the folios in excess of even- length lines to be worked into the leader line. When the figures extend back into the leader line, use an en quad between the leaders and the first figure. 29 MISCELLAITEOUS LEADS AND SLUGS When extracts, etc., are set in smaller type, separate by using two leads in solid matter and three leads in leaded matter. Where, however, solid extracts occur in leaded matter, use two leads only. Before signatures and under date lines in leaded matter use one lead only. Where slugs are called for specially, use a slug of same body as type. PLURALS Use the following form: 2 pairs of shoes (not 2 pair of shoes), etc. POSSESSIVES, AND APOSTROPHE Names ending in \"s\" add apostrophe and **s,\" as Jones's. Anderson & Co.'s warehouse. Do not use the possessive form in such expressions as day labor, quartermaster stores. State prison, States rights (referring to the principle). L'se the singular form for such expressions as printer's ink, 125 miner's inches. PUNCTUATION Observe the following examples of punctuation: George G. Greene, being sworn and examined, on oath deposes and says: Isaac Fuller, sworn, and testified as follows: P. L. Rodier, sworn and examined. Colonel Seventh Cavalry. Captain, Seventh Cavalry.

And if so, state what. 5 feet 6 inches; 2 pounds 6 ounces; 12 chains 4 rods 6 links; but where \"and \" is used, 3 miles, 4 chains, and 6 links. QUOTATION MARKS (see also Titles of books, etc., p. 15) Titles of articles in books, magazines, and newspapers where referred to in text to be quoted, and capitalize first word only, unless a proper word; place all points, and 3 stars when used at end of quoted matter, inside the quotation marks, except in **fol. lit.\" Range words in poetry (according to indention), allowing quotation marks to clear. REFERENCES Where letters are used for references in explaining diagrams, figures, etc., use italics for lower-case references and roman for caps, not quot3d: The bolt a; a pinion, B; angle ab; line CD; points a, 6, c. SIDE AND CUT-IN NOTES Are to be treated the same as text paragraphs; that is, first line indented 1 em and the others flush. Allow 12 ems for cut-in notes unless otherwise instructed, and bear off at least an em blank of the body of the note above and below, and an em space on the inside. MISCELLANEOUS 30 SPACING The spacing of matter must be governed by the leading. Solid matter should be spaced with 3-em spaces, and when alx)ut to divide a word prefer to take in. Leaded matter should also be spaced with 3-em spaces, but when about to divide a word prefer to drive over. In double-leaded matter en quads should be used and divisions driven over. Avoid, if possible, the very thin or very wide spacing of the first line of a paragraph. All lines of composition must be justified so tightly that they will stand unsup- ported in the stick. Observe in spacing the various formations of letters. There should be less space between final \"y\" and initial \"w,** for instance, than between final '*d*' and initial **h;'' less between final *'o\" and initial **c\" than between final *'f\" and initial **b.'* When a little extra spacing is necessary, never place it between a comma and the first letter of succeeding word. The spacing between capital letters in headings should also be governtS by letter formation. Do not do all the spacing at either the right or left of the line, but distribute it in conformity with the foregoing suggestion. The appearance of a page as a whole depends very much upon the care shown in spacing. Always keep together, at the beginning or end of a line, such abbreviations as U. S. N. ; D. C. ; N. Y. ; N. J. ; M. D., etc. The contractions esq., sr., and jr. should always be in the same line with the name they follow. In tables of contents, etc., where the word chapter, figure, or plate is used in the first line before numerals in column (\"chapter,\" etc., bein^ cleared in fol- lowing lines), put an en space between the word and numeral in the fir?«t line and range the periods after the numerals. ' Enacting and resolving clauses: In document measure space the first line so as to conform to the following examples: Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Hesoh^ed hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the Un ited Be it enacted by the Senate and Hovse of Representatives of the United States of America Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America In law measure, space as follows: Be it eniaxited hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of Anterica in Congress assemhled^ That Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assemhled.^ That ADDRESSES, SIGNATURES, AND DATE LINES. [See also Follow— Fol. lit., p. 33.] Capitalize the principal words in address and signature lines. Abbreviations may be used when necessary to the good appearance of a line. Spacing: Use en quads between caps and small caps, except after points use a .*>-eni space. Omit leads where space is clear l)etween date line and address, signature and text, or signature and address. Where end of line is 3 ems or more from dash, omit slug; between 1 and 3 ems, U!^ 2 leads; within 1 em or less, use slug. Esq., jr., and sr. : In text, all lower-case; in a oap-and-small-cap address or signa- ture, Esq., Jr., Sr. ; where address or signature is all caps, Esq., Jr., Sr. 31 ADDRESSES, ETC.. ADDRESSES. The name of a person, a firm, or the title of an official in an address to be at left of page, in caps and small caps, the title or direction following in italics (except *'U. S. Army\" or *^U. S. Navy\" immediately following in same line will be roman). Set first line flush where at beginning of a letter or paper; indent 1 em where placed at end. Copy preparers will indicate place of address. A general address to be all italics. The examples following show some of the forms to be observed: [Where italic line is longer than name line indent italic line 2 ems more than name line. Ordi- narily where both lines are about same length or the italic line is the shorter, place the italic line so that its center will be at the end of the name line. Where address does not make over half a line, and does not touch on date or signature, it can be run in in one line. Com- positors will have to use their judgment as to this.] Brig. Gen. G. L.

Signatures to be at right of page (except witnesses to a signature, which will be at left, as shown in example) in caps and small caps, indented 1, 3, and 5 ems, accord- ing to the number of lines, title or direction following to be as in addresses. Make 2 lines where signature and title or dire^ition together make more than half a line. Mr., Mrs., or any title preceding a signature set in caps to be caps and small caps.

A date at beginning of letter or paper is to be placed at right of page, indented 1, 3, and 5 ems, according to the number of lines. Copy preparers will indicate as nearly as they can how they are to be broken, and caps, small caps, and italics. 33 ADDRESSES, ETC.

Copy marked \"fol.\" means to follow figures, italics, abbreviations, idiomatic words and expressions, and &c. or etc., but not capitalization or punctuation. Any- thing else to be followed will be indicated on the copy or written instructions furnished. All orthography in \"fol.'' matter is good that has the sanction of any dictionary. Copy marked \"fol. lit.\" means to follow abbreviations, accents, ca]f)italization, figures, italics, paragraphs, punctuation, signs, spelling, syntax, and compounding of words. USE OF ITALICS. Names of vessels should be set in italic, except in tables and footnotes to same, indexes, lists set in columns, and Supreme Court work. The words *'see,\" \"see also,\" etc., to be in italic in indexes only. Italics will not be followed in general work, either for foreign words or to denote emphasis, unless special instructions to that effect are given. Scientific names of genera and species are to be in italics; names of classes, orders, families, etc., in roman. GENERAL TESTIMONY. [See also Punctuation, p. 29.] Contract the first Q. and A. , as well as the following ones. Make one paragraph of question and answer, connecting the question and its answer by an em dash; but where there is a choke, use 2-em dash only: Q. Did you see A. No, sir. Where the answer is not introduced by the regular **A.,\" \"Ans.,\" or ** Answer,\" or where the name or title of a participant is used, make a new paragraph. The following examples illustrate the use of brackets, colons, and parentheses: The Chairman (to Mr. Smith), Mr. Kelley (to the chairman). The AViTNEss. He did it that way [indicating]. Q.

Act 5th August, 1882 (Supp. Rev. Stat., 284; Stat. L., 28). Make sentences of single citations occurring at conclusion of sentences or para- graphs, except \"p.\" or \"pp.,\" which will be close up and period outside of paren- thesis. Where citations follow clauses, the final citation, if occurring at the end of the sentence, will necessarily be closed up. In citations of single lines, use period at end of each line. Where run in, use semicolons. Observe style of the following: The said paper was marked \"Defendant's Exhibit No. 4.\" The defendant's Exhibit No. 4 was thereupon placed on file. (See also Punctuation p. 29. ) SUPREME COURT RECORDS. [See also Follow— Fol. lit., p. 33.] Make paragraphs of answers in Q. and A. matter. The folio number is to appear in the same line as the first word of the folio, flush, and in a cut-in 3 ems square, except where there is white space above or below; indentions for paragraphs, etc., to be in addition to the 3-em cut-in. Excepting italics (which stand for errors only), capitalization, and punctuation, follow copy literally when it is manuscript. In typewritten records manifest errors of the typewriter are to be corrected, such, for instance, as where a letter has been struck over another or where a space in a word shows that a letter was intended to appear but was not struck hard enough to make an impression; but if a good word is used in the wrong place — as, \"in\" for ** on,\" \"boot\" for \"boat,\" etc.^^io not change or use italics. Words having the sanction of any dictionary are considered good. Use italic letters to indicate errors in orthography, except in names of persons and firms and geographic names, words in foreign languages that are not law terms, and errors in syntax. Errors in words set in italics will be indicated by roman letters. Doublets will be indicated by italicizing the repeated portion. Names of vessels to be set in roman, quoted. Use apostrophe to indicate the omission of one or more letters in a word; but in well-established abbreviations omit apostrophe and use period. Use a 3-em quad to indicate the omission of one or more words. Capitalize the word \"The\" only in such cases as the following: the said The B. & O. R. R. Co. ; The Sun v. The Globe; The City of Washington v. The B. & O. R. R. Co. ; the defendant The Davies County Bank. 35 BILL STYLE BILL STYLE. Unless special directions are given — sometimes necessary in particular cases — the following rules govern the printing of bills: TYPE Bills are always set in English type, full-slugged. A new bill is always all roman, italic being used only for the enacting clause and the word ** Provided.^ ^ SIDE FOLIOS The direction ''Allow for two figures '' means that TWO 1-EM quads (not one 2-em quad) are to be used in allowing for side folios at left of text. * 'Allow for three figures\" means indent two 1-em quads and one en quad. Always supply the word \"That\" immediately following the section number (except when quoting sections of Revised Statutes) and after the word \"iVo- vided^' of a proviso. ENGROSSED AND ENROLLED BILLS A bill is said to be engrossed when it has passed one House of Congress; to be enrolled when final action has been taken in both Houses. Follow literally in engrossed and enrolled bills. This applies to the title of the bill on the filing or indorsement as well as to the text, but not to the caption of engrossed amendments. Read twice, fol. lit. HEADS AND INDORSEMENTS The '* indorsement\" on a bill is the form printed on the back for convenience of reference when folded. \"Bill style\" prevails on indorsements. As a bill pro- gresses new \"actions\" appear, which should be set in the same style as the \"actions\" that precede. (See examples of the heading and indorsement of a new bill in each House given on pp. 37, 38. ) The name of the introducer of a bill or resolution is carried under the title in the indorsement, in lopg primer caps and small caps, between parallel rules, in both Houses, through each printing until bill or resolution passes one House. When the title of a bill on the indorsement makes more than two lines, indent the run overs 1 J ems; center the title when it makes but one or two lines. On the face of the bill where a title makes more than one line, set the first line to full measure, centering the runover if there be two lines in the title; if more • than two lines, indent the runovers 2 ems. Titles for House bills are taken from the indorsement of copy; for Senate bills from the face of copy. When in doubt, consult with the foreman. Preambles are set full measure, the first line of each \" whereas \" being flush and the runovers indented 2 ems. Where an agreement or treaty is part of a pream- ble, follow literally, indenting the paragraphs 4 ems and runovers 2 ems, full measure. Titles and preambles following the head of a bill are always half-slugged. Set \" [Calendar No., — \" on both face and indorsement of bills which have reached the Senate Calendar, in each case at the upper right-hand corner. Set \"Report No.\" on both face and indorsement of reported bills in both Houses, centering under the number of the bill. [It is impracticable to give illustrations of the minutiae of headings and indorse- ments of bills in all their stages. Samples and information can alwavs be had upon inquiry at the foreman's desk. Compositors and others must familiarize themselves with the forms called for by the clerks' notes on copy.] AMENDMENTS \"Line type\" and italic are used only to show amendments. When it is pro- posed to strike out certain portions in a bill that is \" reported with amendments,\" such portions will be set in \" line type,\" and matter proposed to be inserted will be set in italics. When it is proposed to strike out and insert, always let the italics follow the line type. Do not complicate amendments. When one amendment can be made to cover the sense, as in the complete changing of a sum of money, so set it, rather than divide into two or more short amendments. BILL STYLE 36 AMENDMENTS— Continued. Do not use **line type*' or italics to show amendments in the title of a bill; but allow the original title to stand in its place, and put the proposed title with the introductory words * 'Amend the title so as to read:*' at the end of the bill in a half-slugged paragraph, all roman. Example : Amend the title so as to read: \"A bill granting an increase of pension to John Smith.\" Do not put a part of a word in italics or \"line type/* At times the copy will indicate a letter only added to or taken from a word, or an amount like ** twenty- five*' will be changed to ** twenty** by striking out the *'five.'* In such cases use \"line type** for the original word and put the proposed word in italics. Proposed Senate amendments are printed in bill form, all roman. When it is proposed in the Senate to make several short amendments, the caption should read as follows: AMEin>MEKTS Intended to be proposed by Mr. Hoar to the bill (H. R. 4864) to reduce taxation, to provide revenue for the Government, and for other purposes, viz: 1 In line 24, page 19, strike out the words \" per centum ad valorem \" and insert the words 2 '• cents per pound; \" in line 16, page 25, strike out the word \" shall; \" and in line 12, page 34, 3 after the word \" and,\" insert the word \" any.\" When a proposed amendment in the Senate is expressed by one or more full paragraphs, the caption should read: AMEin>in:xT Intended to be proposed by Mr. Gorman to the bill (H. R. 2476) entitled \"An Act to establish a fish-hatching station at Port Tobacco, Maryland,\" viz: After the word \" Maryland,\" in line 14, section 2, insert the following: 1 To enable the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to carry out the provisions 2 o/ this Act there is hereby appropriated the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars. REPORTED BILLS Observe the difference in form of action taken on Senate and House bills reported with amendments: House, — December 12, 1897. Reported with amendments, committed to Committee of the Whole House, and ordered to be printed. [Omit the part struck through and insert the part printed in italics.] Senate. — December 13, 1897. Reported by Mr. Harris, with an amendment. [Omit the part struck through and insert the part printed in italics.] [The wording varies with the necessities of the case, but the style remains the same.] GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Spell out everything, except \"Mr.,\" \"Mrs.,\" and"
