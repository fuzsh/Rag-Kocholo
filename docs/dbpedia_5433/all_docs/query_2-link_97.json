        "text": "Not all road accidents in the Philippines are reported by the media, and not everyone involved in car mishaps gets to be in the news. In order for a car accident to be qualified as a news story, either the tragedy must be odd, intriguing or devastating, or a famous personality is involved. And when a celebrity is tagged in the event, the severity gets even further magnified.\n\nLet's look back at some Pinoy celebrities who got into vehicular accidents:\n\nAlyssa Alano\n\nTV host Alyssa Alano was seriously injured after figuring in a predawn road accident in Marikina at dawn of October 2012. The Everest-type SUV that she drove was wrecked after hitting the center island of Marcos Highway near the SM Marikina area and spun. At least four other people who aboard a Honda sedan hit by Alyssa were also hurt. Rescue teams extricated Alano from her SUV.\n\nRead more:\n\nKiller Highways: 10 Most Accident Prone Roads in the Philippines\n\nThe Consequences of Not Getting Car Insurance\n\nAJ Perez\n\nThe 19-year-old fresh-faced actor was declared dead due to multiple head and neck injuries as a result of a car accident while on the way home from a Star Magic show in Dagupan, Pangasinan in April 2011. The car he was in collided with another vehicle along MacArthur Highway in Moncada, Tarlac. AJ’s corneas were later donated to two different recipients not long after his death.\n\nAngelica Panganiban\n\nJust recently, actress Angelica Panganiban is safe, following a minor accident involving her brand new Mazda and a passenger cab, at the southbound lane of EDSA-Greenhills. She was about to turn right to Annapolis street when her car accidentally hit a taxi. Her vehicle and the cab had dents.\n\nRead more:\n\n5 Craziest Car Accidents People Walked Away From\n\n3 Real-Life Drivers Saved By Car Insurance\n\nWhy Filipinos Ignore Insurance\n\nLino Brocka\n\nDirector Lino Brocka is a pioneer in the Philippine cinema. His name rose to fame after creating critically acclaimed films such as Insiang, Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, Bona, and Gumapang Ka sa Lusak. He died because of a car accident on the night of May 21, 1991. The car he was on hit an electric post along East Avenue, Quezon City. The driver of the car was actor William Lorenzo, who was also severely injured but survived the crash.\n\nSharon Cuneta\n\nMegastar Sharon Cuneta was in a car accident one night of November 2013 on her way home from a taping. According to her, she was going the right way in Bonifacio Global City when a speeding car from her right hit her van. While nobody got hurt, she admitted that she was shaken up since this was not the first time she found herself in a vehicular mishap. Her tire burst and the frontal bumper of the car that hit her van was wrecked.\n\nRichard Gutierrez\n\nActor from a showbiz clan Richard Gutierrez got injured after they figured in a road accident in an accident-prone area at the Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay Road in Puting Kahoy village in Silang, Cavite in May 2009. Richard was the one driving his Nissan Skyline GTR sports car on his way home from a shooting. Unfortunately, his assistant died while being treated in the hospital while his bodyguard suffered relatively minor injuries. Authorities said there have been complaints that there are no lights or safety barriers on the part of the road during the accident.\n\nNo one wants to make headlines because of some unfortunate events. But everyone, whether you're a celebrity or not, must be prepared for it. Be prepared by getting insurance for your vehicle.\n\nRelated:"
