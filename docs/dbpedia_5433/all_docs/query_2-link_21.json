Quezon, the 2nd President of the Philippines, and is the most populous city in the country.[1]\n\nIt is known as the cultural, entertainment and media capital of the Philippines, and is aptly called as the \"City of Stars\". Major broadcasting networks have their headquarters and studios in the city. It is also known for its commerce, education, research, technology, politics, tourism, art and sports.[1]\n\nLocations[]\n\nBagumbayan[]\n\nEastwood City is an 18.5 hectares (46 acres) mixed-use development complex located in Barangay Bagumbayan, Quezon City. Launched in 1997, it is Megaworld Corporation’s first “live-work-play” community that offers complete facilities, amenities, and establishments for living, working, playing, and shopping.[2]\n\nThe Reyna Manananggal, leader of the manananggal, resides in one of Eastwood City's condominiums, overseeing the migration of her fellow manananggal as well as managing the clan's affairs.[3]\n\nCubao[]\n\nLocated at the southern part of the city, Cubao is the home of the 35-hectare Araneta City, a mixed-use township development that contains prominent shopping malls such as Ali Mall, Farmers Plaza and Gateway Mall and iconic landmarks such as the Araneta Coliseum. The Cubao Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao.[1]\n\nDarago and Darranga tried to set up a movie theater in Cubao that plays action movies, war movies and other B-movies, but audiences started to favor the convenience of watching movies on their VHS or VCD players.[4]\n\nIn Farmer's Market, an segben named Ernesto made a living under the guise of a human butcher. Alexander Trese often frequented his stall to buy meats, building a rapport with the Trese family that would carry over generations to Alexandra Trese.[5] There are also several aswang in the market, who later had a turf war started by the manananggal because of accusations that the aswang murdered one of them.[6]\n\nDecades later, a dancer named Janette Lucero was murdered along with four members of the Skeleton Crew in a club in Cubao owned by a woman named Mama Lan. This was later investigated by Anton Trese while accompanied by his then thirteen year old daughter Alexandra. Not far from this area, aswang had a gun smuggling operation under the guise of a meat factory just outside Farmer's Market that was taken down by Puti and his gang.[7]\n\nMore than a decade later, Dr. Karl Burgos immolated his sixth victim In Cubao's Chancellor Hotel and started a three day fire that raged in the city.[8]\n\nAlexandra Trese and the Kambal stopped escaped inmate Kenbhoy Calzada, who was under the influence of Talagbusao. from suicide bombing the Araneta Coliseum. After seeing a live video feed of him on the news, they immediately used a Dragon's Gate to teleport to the stadium, separate Kenbhoy from the explosive and safely detonate it in the air.[9]\n\nDiliman[]\n\nDiliman is located at the center of Quezon City, the place where the city was originally established. Named for the Tagalog word for the medicinal fern species Stenochlaena palustris, Diliman is where numerous national government offices are located, as well as prominent colleges and universities and major commercial broadcasting media headquarters.[1]\n\nAnton Trese and Alexandra Trese met with Amang Paso and Boyet near Quezon Memorial Shrine, hoping to let them use the duwende tunnels to get to Fort Bonifacio to stop Talagbusao. Though initially apprehensive, Amang Paso allows their passage after being bribed with Choc-Nut.[10]\n\nMedia company ABC-ZNN has their headquarters located along Tomas Morato Avenue. Heather Evangelista was murdered by prominent actress Nova Aurora in the company's Studio 4.[11]\n\nEnrique Trese works as a professor of anthropology and sociology based in University of the Philippines Diliman.[12]\n\nKatipunan Avenue[]\n\nThe Blasco residence is located in #66 Orakulo Street, La Bendita Vista Village, a subdivision area along Katipunan Avenue. It originally belonged to Dante Blasco, who conducted extensive paranormal research. After Dante's death the house was inherited by his son William, who moved in with his wife and child after he lost his job in America.[13]\n\nWilliam, Blaire Blasco, Emilio and Rose were possessed by demons after opening an antique trunk holding them. The demons restrained the family's daughter Linda Blasco to stage a possession in order to lure in Father Matt. Matt eventually came with Father Bronze and Father Alloy, who caught on to the demons' ruse. After a prolonged fight, Father Matt was able to exorcise the four demons by triggering Linda's stigmata. Surveillance was kept on the family afterwards.[13]\n\nNew Manila[]\n\nNew Manila is named after the City of Manila, since most of its residents are affluent families from the city who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital. It was formerly a part of San Juan before being carved out from its mother town to form Quezon City.[1]\n\nIn 1963, a civilian named Gina Santos died in a car accident on the intersection of 13th Street and Balete Drive, haunting the road as a spirit afterwards. Herbert Tomas died in a car accident on the same road decades later, leaving behind his pregnant partner, Ms. De La Rosa. Ten months after Herbert's death, Ms. De La Rosa trapped Gina Santos' spirit in a circle made of mermaid bones and killed her a second time. She died in her house near the intersection when it burned down ten months later.[14]\n\nA nuno resides in the manhole of the intersection, having been forced to move there after pollution made termite hills unlivable for him. He often helps Alexandra Trese in her investigations, providing crucial information and identifying different materials for her.[14]\n\nMindanao Avenue[]\n\nMindanao Avenue is an eight-to-ten lane divided avenue connecting EDSA and NLEX and is a part of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) in Metro Manila. It is one of three parallel roads that connects Tandang Sora and Congressional Avenues that were named after the three island groups of the Philippines, with Mindanao Avenue being named after Mindanao.[15]\n\nAlong the avenue was an aswang slaughterhouse that served as a restaurant for their own people. Survivors from a fire in a squatter's settlement in Guadalupe were relocated into a building in Quezon City, being promised food and proper accomodation. However, this was a front for a human trafficking operation that gave the survivors to the aswang, taking them for consumption in the slaughterhouse. Alexandra Trese and the Kambal took down this slaughterhouse, killing the aswang in it as well as rescuing fifty victims.[16]\n\nUnspecified Locations[]\n\nPipol's Bookstore[]\n\nRamona and her children hid nearby Pipol's Bookstore to lose the people tracking them down for killing Janette Lucero and four members of the Skeleton Crew. Puti and his pack of segben successfully tracked them down to this location, but three of them were murdered by Ramona's children.[17] Bantay, the only survivor of the attack, was able to escape thanks to a vial of dragon's blood and a Dragon's Gate hidden underneath his bandana.[18]\n\n#77 Marte St.[]\n\n#77 Marte St. was the previous residence of Ding and Nida Vargas, siblings that moved into the city from the province. Alexandra Trese paid a visit to Nida questioning her involvement in the murder of Roberto Rodriguez, but does not get any direct confession. Later, she tracked an injured Ding, who was powered by the Adarna Stone, back into this residence. Ding succumbed to to his wounds and dies at the hands of his sister Nida. With the power of the Adarna Stone, she brings her brother's corpse and flied away, abandoning their residence.[19]"
