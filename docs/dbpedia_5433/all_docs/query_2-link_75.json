        "text": "The areas called “Projects” in Quezon City where government housing projects that started to relocate Manila residents after World War II (1939-1945). However, this program originated with the 1938 plans of President Manuel Luis Molina Quezón (1878-1944) to build the Balíntawak City (now Quezon City) as the new capital of the Philippines. Quezón’s Homestead Program was developed to entice people to move into the new city, with the People’s Homesite Corporation (PHC) developing the roads and houses in the 1,529 hectares of Diliman Estate, purchased from the Tuason clan, through the matriarch Doña Maria Teresa Eriberta De La Paz Tuason (1867-1951), as mitigated by her nephew Angel “Bobby” M. Tuason Valdez (1899-1948). The one of the first communities constructed was Barrio Obrero (Worker’s Village) in the current Kamuning District.\n\nFor the new residents of Barrio Oberro to travel from Quezon City to their jobs in Manila, Pres.Quezón insructs the Luzon Bus Lines to plied the route from the Tutuban Station to Kamuning Road, for the fare of 5 centavos.\n\nAfter World War II, specifically the Battle of Manila (February 3 to March 3, 1945), much of Manila was left in shambles by the US bombings, Japanese sapping, and street to street fire fights. After the war, it was up to President Sergio Osmeña Sr. (1878-1961) to rebuilt Manila and other cities devastated by the war, as well as find housing for the families displaced by the destruction of their homes, with the establishment of the National Housing Commission (NHC) in 1945. After Osmeña’s term ended in 1946, it was his successor, Manuel Acuña Roxas (1892-1948), to continue the post war-reconstruction and housing with the establishment of the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) in 1947.\n\nWith the sudden death of Pres. Roxas in 1948, it was up to his successor, President Elpidio Rivera Quirino (1890-1956) to continue with the rebuilding and relocation of the people. This led to the expansion of Barrior Obrero as Project 1 in 1949, and the opening of Project 2, Project 3, and Project 4, between 1952 and 1954. The whole area of project 2 to 4 was generally called the Quirino District, after he died in his home in Novaliches. In memoriam to the president to have given these communities new homes, several institutions were name after him, such as the Elpidio Quirino Elementary School (est. 1952), the Quirino High School (est. 1953), and the renaming of the Labor Hospital (est. 1953) to the Quirino Memorial Medical Center in 1964.\n\nFrom Quezon to Quirino’s programs, Arch. Juan Arellano was the chief architect in planning Projects 1 to 3, with designs that were inspired by the Spanish colonial “Bahay na Bato,” while adopting modern architectural requirements and aesthetics. The first homes were bungalow-type houses in 100 square meter lots, but latter designs had two-stories that occupied 180 and 240 square meter lots. The later homes showcased capiz shell windows (Placuna placenta), further showing its colonial inspiration.\n\nArch. Juan Marcos de Guzmán Arellano (1888-1960) is known as one of the Philippines’ founding fathers of architecture. He finished his studies at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1908; while taking art lessons under noted masters Lorenzo Leogardo Guerrero (1835 -1904), Toribio Asona Antillon (1856-1913), and Fabian de la Rosa. When most people thought that he would pursue a full time career in the arts, Arellano decided to take architectural studies at the Drexel Institute in 1908, and further architectural studies at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. However the draw to painting could not be resisted and he to additional art studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1911. As an architect, Arellano is most noted for Manila’s Metropolitan Theater (1935), Executive House (1926, now houses the National Museum of the Philippines), the Manila Post Office Building (1926), and Jones Bridge.\n\nDuring the term of President Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay (1907-1957), the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation completed Projects 5 to 8 between 1955 and 1957. However, with the tragic death of Pres. Magsaysay, no new major housing projects were enacted, until the term of President Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos Sr. (1917-1989). Pres. Magsaysay was so beloved by the people that they renamed the Quezon City High School Annex (est. 1953) to Ramon Magsaysay High School, and founded a Project 8 barangay in his name after Victoriano Dinum Diamonon (1894-1977). drafter the modern barangay law in 1962.\n\nProject 1\n\nProject 1 started as Barrio Obrero (Workers’ Barrio) in 1939, and has expanded to include the currently named Barangay Roxas and Barangay Kamuning by 1949. The Barrio Obrero started with 439 houses, which were raffled to blue-collar workers at an installment payment plan of eight pesos a month. In 1940, the first mass in the barrio was conducted by Fr. Herman Kondring of Society of the Divine Word’s (SDV) Christ the King Mission Seminary along the España Extension. This Christmas mass led to the SDV establishing the Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish in 1941, to serve the new community. One of establishments that still operate to this day since its opening in 1939 is the Kamuning Bakery. The first market of Barrio Obrero is now the Bernardo Park near the southwestern corner of EDSA and Kamuning Road.\n\nBarangay Roxas was allotted to government employees, and was named after Pres. Manuel Roxas. The major roads of Project 1 are Kamuning Road and Mayor Tomas Morato Avenue (originally Sampaloc Avenue, and renamed after Mayor Tomás Eduardo Bernabéu Morató, 1887-1965), which were named after the abundant Sampaloc (Tamarindus indica) and Kamuning (Murraya Paniculata) trees growing in the area. Continuing “plant” there of the area, street in Barangay Roxas are named after flowers: Azucena (Tube Rose, Polianthes tuberosa), Begonia (family Begoniaceae), Cadena De Amor (Coral Vine, Antigonon leptopus), Campupot (Sampaguita , Jasminum sambac), Champaca (Magnolia champaca), Dahlia (family Asteraceae), Everlasting (Starflower, Helichrysum bracteatum), Florpiña (Bromeliad, family Bromeliaceae), Gladiola (genus Gladiolus), Gumamela (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), Hyacinth (geus Hyacinthus), Jasmine (genus Jasminum), Lilac (genus Syringa), Madre Silva (Honeysuckle, genus Lonicera), Magnolia (family Magnoliaceae), Narcissus (Daffodil, family Amaryllidaceae), Tulip (genus Tulipa), Umbel (Santan, Ixora finlaysoniana), and Waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana). Barangay Roxas is still a residential area; with the primary landmark is the Holy Family Parish (est. 1953). The first market in Barangay Roxas was built in 1940, where the Don Alejandro Roces Sr. Science-Technology High School currently stands. Other landmarks in the area are the General Roxas Elementary School (est. 1949), the Manuel Roxas High School (est. as the Quezon City High School Annex, 1957), and the Amoranto Sports Complex (built 1966).\n\nProjects 2 and 3\n\nCompleted in 1952, Project 2 and Project 3 is called the Quirino District, and is comprised of the barangays Amihan (North Wind), Claro (Clear View), Duyan-Duyan (Swinging Cradle), and Quirino 2A, Quirino 2B, Quirino 2C, and Quirino 3A. The main roads of both projects are the 1.8 kilometer Kamias Road and the 900 meter Anonas Street, which are named after the native trees Kamias (Cucumber tree, Averrhoa bilimbi) and Anonas (Custard Apple, Annona reticulata). Other streets in the district are also named after Philippine trees, such as Acacia (Samanea saman), Aguho (Whistling Pine, Casuarina equisetifolia), Akle (East Indian Walnut, Albizia acle), Almaciga (Dayogong, Agathis philippinensis), Almon (Shorea almon), Amayan (Licania splendens), Amugis (Koordersiodendron pinnatum), Anislag (Flueggea flexuosa), Anubing (Artocarpus ovatus), Apitong (Dipterocarpus grandiflorus), Arangga (Homalium foetidum), Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Banuyo (Wallaceodendron celebicum), Batino (Alstobnia macrophylla), Bignay (Currant Tree, Antidesma bunius), Caimito (Star Apple, Chrysophyllum cainito), Chico (Achras zapota), Dao (New Guinea Walnut, Dracontomelon dao), Dapdap (Indian coral Tree, Erythrina variegata), Dungon (Heritiera sylvatica), Durian (Durio zibethinus), Guijo (Shorea guiso), Guyabano (Soursop, Annona muricata), Ipil (Borneo Teak, Intsia bijuga), Kalantas (Red Cedar, Toona calantas), Kamagong (Diospyros discolor), Kubili (Cubilia cubili), Langka (Jack fruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus), Lanzones (Lansium domesticum), Lauan (genus Shorea), Marang (Johey Oak, Artocarpus odoratissimus), Molave (Chaste Tree, Vitex parviflora), Naranghita (Dalanghita, Citrus reticulate), Narra (Pterocarpus indicus), Pajo (Mangifera altissima), Palosapis (White Lauan, Shorea palosapis), Rimas (Breadfruit, Artocarpus altilis), Siniguelas (Spanish Plum, Spondias purpurea), Supa (Sindora supa), Tampoy (Rose Apple, Syzygium jambos), Tindalo (Afzelia rhomboidea), and Yakal (Shorea astylosa). Major landmarks in the district are the Saint Joseph Archdiocesan Shrine (est. 1951), the Holy Family Parish, the Elpidio Quirino Elementary School, the Quirino High School, and the St. Joseph Catholic School.\n\nProject 4\n\nCompleted in 1954 as 3,039 family units in 92 hectares, Project 4 is the largest of the Homesite districts, and is comprised on 15 barangays. The name of Barangay Bagumbuhay (new life) captures the joy of the new residents, upon their moving to their news homes in 1950. The streets of the central area have names based on Philippine historical figures, specifically names of Islamic chieftains and less-known revolutionary heroes. However the main road of central Project 4 is J. P. Rizal Street, which is named after the National Hero, Dr. José Protasio Alonso Realonda Rizál Mercado (1861-1896), whose writings inspired the people to stand up against the Spanish colonizers. To continue the honoring of Rizal, one of the barangays is named Villa Maria Clara, after one of the lead characters of Rizal’s propagandist novel “Noli Me Tangere” (Touch Me Not, 1887). Nearby streets have names of people connected to Rizal; such as his mother, Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos (1826-1911), his sister Saturnina Rizal Mercado de Hidalgo (1850-1913), his brother General Paciano Alonso Realonda Rizal Mercado (1851-1930), his trial defender Fr. Vicente García y Teodoro (1817–1899), and his lovers Leonor Rivera–Kipping (1867-1893) and Marie Josephine Leopoldine Bracken (1876-1902). The Teodora Alonzo Elementary School (est. 1970) is also named after Rizal’s mother.\n\nRoads with Islamic chieftain names range from the legendary Bornean chieftains Datu Sumakwel and Kalantiaw (Rajah Bendahara Kalantiaw, lived around 1433); the pre-colonial Rajah Salalila (1500s); to the Spanish colonial period Manila chieftain Rajah Matandâ (Rája Aché, 1480-1572), Lakan Dula (1503-1575) and Datu Magat Salamat (reigned 1580-1589) of Tondo, and Ali-Mudin (Sultan Muhammad Azim ud-Din I of Sulu, reined 1732-1764). Despite these historical Muslim leaders, there is no established mosque in Project 4; while there are many Christian buildings, such as the Monasterio de Santa Clara (est. 1630 in Manila, built 1950 in Quezon City) and the Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish (est. 1976).\n\nThe barangays of Bayanihan (nationalism and/or community spirit, est. 1972-1975) and Tagumpay (victory, est. 1975) relate to the many heroes of which the streets are named after: 1587-1588 Tondo Rovolt leader Agustin de Legazpi (died 1588), the 1621-1622 Bicolano Revolt head Tamblot, the 1660-1661 Pangasinan Revolt leader Andres Malong, the 1649-1650 Visayan Revolt head Juan Agustín Ponce Sumuroy, the Ilocano revolutionist Diego Andaya Silang (1730-1763), the 1744-1823 Boholano Revolt leader Francisco Dagohoy (born Francisco Sendrijas, 1724-1800), the secular reformist Fr. Pedro Sebastián Peláez (1812–1863), the 1823 Intramuros Revolt head Captain Andrés Novales (1800-1823), the 1860s Cavite revolutionary Casimiro “El Tulisan” Camerino, and the 1964 Tagalog Revolt’s Pedro Ladia. Several members of the Trece Mártires de Cavite (Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite) also have streets named after them; such as Luis Aguado (1863-1896), Eugenio Cabezas (1855-1896), Feliciano Cabuco (1965-1896), Agapito Conchu (1862-1896) Alfonso de Ocampo (1860-1896), Máximo Gregorio (1856-1896), Máximo F. Inocencio (1833-1896), Victoriano Luciano (1863-1896), and Jose Ma. Hugo Pérez (1856-1896). Another martyr, of the 1872 Cavite Mutiny, Fr. José Apolonio García Burgos (1837-1872), also has a street named after him; and the barangay and road Dioquino Zobel is named after the propagandist who was also implicated in the mutiny, Don “Quino” Jacobo Zangroniz Zóbel (1842-1896). Two public schools in Project 4 are named after 20th Century heroes: Pura V. Kalaw Elementary School (est. 1953) and Jose P. Laurel Sr. High School (est. 1965).\n\nThe northeastern most barangays of ESCOPA I, ESCOPA II and ESCOPA III are named after the Philippine Army’s 1st Signal Corps Philippine Army (1SCOPA); who had built “Barrio Lata” (Tin Can) in 1943, for their families to be near the army’s Camp Murphy (now Camp Aguinaldo). That military background links to the streets named after generals of the Katipunan revolution against the Spanish (1565-1898) and American (1898-1946) occupation of the Philippines: General Francisco del Castillo (died 1897), General Mariano Álvarez (1818-1924), Major General Vito Loyola Belarmino (1857-1933), Brigadier General Pablo Ocampo Tecson (1859-1933), Lieutenant General Edilberto Evangelista (1862-1897), General Críspulo Famy Aguinaldo (1863-1897), Brigadier General Daniel Tria Tirona (1864-1939), Major General Miguel Carpio Malvar (1865-1911), General Antonio Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta (1866-1899), Brigadier General Teresa “Nay Isa” Ferraris Magbanua (1868-1947), General Tomás Echenique Mascardo (1871-1932), Major José Torres Gonzales Bugallón (1873-1899), “Father of the Malolos Constitution” Felipe Gonzáles Calderón y Roca (1868-1908), and Philippine-American War propagandist Isabelo delos Reyes (1864-1938).\n\nCompared to Project 1 to 3, Project 4 was made for middle class families, as evident of the many entertainment facilities in the 1960s; such as the movie theaters Bell, Mark, Morric, People’s, and Rose, as well as the Golden Lanes bowling alley. Other barangay names that reflected that middle class taste are Masagana (bountiful), and Marilag (beautiful, 1975). Barangay Milagrosa (miraculous) reflects the faith of its residents, especially for their belief in the divine intervention by pilgrimage to the Monasterio de Santa Clara. Barangay Mangga was named after the small mango (Mangifera carabao) groves in the area.\n\nThe vista of Marikina Valley from the hillside barangays Blue Ridge A and Blue Ridge B reminded the founder, Colonel Rafael Reynado E. Estrada (1920-2016), of the Blue Ridge Mountains of America he had visited before, as he developed these gated villages for World War II veterans.\n\nProject 5\n\nProject 5 is comprised of the barangays of E. Rodriguez, West Kamias, and Kamuning. Barangay E. Rodriguez is named after the longest serving Philippine senate presidents, Eulogio “Amang” Adona Rodríguez Sr. (1883-1964), who lived in the nearby New Manila. Barangay E. Rodriguez is located at the northeast corner of Aurora Boulevard and Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, or the Cubao District. The roads of Barangay E. Rodriguez are named after renowned American and European universities; such as the 1096 University of Oxford, the 1209 University of Cambridge, the 1636 Harvard University, the 1701 Yale University, the 1787 University of Pittsburgh, the 1802 United States Military Academy (or West Point), the 1816 State University of New York at Potsdam, the 1831 New York University, the 1842 University of Notre Dame du Lac, the 1844 State University of New York at Albany, the 1845 United States Naval Academy (or Annapolis), the 1863 La Salle University, the 1869 Purdue University, the 1878 Université de Montréal, the 1891 Leland Stanford Junior University (or Stanford University), the 1923 University of Saint Mary, and the 1925 University of Miami.\n\nThe Kamias district was built at the northwestern part of Project 2, with Kamias Road as its main thoroughfare. As the population grew, the Kamias District was divided in 1975 as Kamias East and Kamias West. And across EDSA, Barangay Kamuning was opened at the corner of EDSA and Kamuning Road. All three barangays have side roads that use alpha-numerical names, such a K-3; while the main thoroughfares are Ermin Erfe Garcia Sr. Street, New York Street, Kamias Road and Kamuning Street. Noted landmarks are the Mayor Pociano Bernardo Park (est. 1947), the Ramon Magsaysay High School (est. 1953), the Quezon City Jail (1953), the Stella Maris College and Convent (est. 1955), the Quezon City Main Public Library (est. 1968), the Holy Family Parish (1980), and the Nativity of the Lord Parish (est. 1999).\n\nProject 6\n\nProject 6 is part of the Magsaysay District, along with Project 7 and Project 8; which was originally called Barrio Pag-Asa (Hope), as the new residential communities represented a new life for the people.\n\nThe roads in Project 6 use mostly alphanumeric names; and was also opened to many employees in media, earning the moniker of the first “Newsmen row” in the Philippines. The major landmarks of Project 6 are the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (est. 1955) and the Mount Carmel Parish (est. 1958).\n\nProject 7\n\nProject 7, and parts of Project 8, was originally called Barrio Bago Bantay (New Guardians); which may have derived its name from the war era US Naval Radio Station in Misamis Street that remained operational until 1962. Project 7 is comprised of the barangays Bungad (growth or entryway) and Veterans Village, which was opened of veterans of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and its proximity to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center.\n\nStreet in Vetreans Village are named after Philippine trees and plants; such as Alibangbang (Pink Butterfly Tree, Bauhinia monandra), Anahaw (Round-leaf Fountain Palm, Saribus rotundifolius), Aramismis (Vitex parviflora), Bakawan (Mangrove, Rhizophora mangle), Bansalangin (Mimusops elengi), Calumpang (Wild Almond, Sterculia foetida), Calumpit (Terminalia edulis), Danupra (Mountain Cedar, Toona ciliate), Duhat (Black Plum, Syzygium jambolanum), Kalamansanay (Philippine Almond, Terminaliacalamansanai), Kalyos (Siamese Rough Brush, Streblus asper), Kawayan (Bamboo, family Bambusa), Lanete (Wrightia pubescens), Lanutan (Mitrephora lanotan), Malungay (Allophylus cobbe), Mangachapoy (Hopea acuminata), Narig (Vatica elliptica), Pagatpat (Sonneratia evenia), Pahutan (Mangifera altissima), Palomaria (Calophyllum inophyllum), Payna, Saleng (Benguet Pine, Pinus insularis), and Tanguile (Philippine Mahogany, Shorea polysperma). Noted landmarks in Project 7 are the Senator Esteban E. Abada Elementary School (formerly the Veterans Elementary School, est. 1955), the Christ the King Parish (est. 1961), and the Project 7 Public Library (est. 1966).\n\nProject 8\n\nProject 8 is the 2nd largest of the Homesite locations; and is comprised of the barangays of Baesa, Bahay Toro, Ramon Magsaysay, Sangandaan, and Santo Kristo. Aside for the American period Bago Bantay Naval Radio Station, the area of Project 8 had an older history that reached to the Spanish colonial period, as it was part of the Balíntawak District that is noted for the revolutionary “Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin” of 1896 and the 1936 Jesuit San José Seminary (now the Quezon City General Hospital). Bahay Toro (Cattle Home) was already noted during the Spanish era, as it was a grazing area of herds of water buffalo (Carabao, Bubalus Bubalis); while Baesa was recorded as early as the 1910 census, and it was named after an old woman who lived alone (babaeng na iisa); and Sangandaan was once had a pathway through a thick forests, with the tree branches (sanga) stretching into the path (daan).\n\nWith the establishment of Project 8, the much of area was named as Barrio Bagong Pag-asa, and it was first developed to house informal settlers and indigent families for Manila’s districts of Intramuros, Singalong, Paco and Tondo. Years later, more communities were developed for government employees, specifically for those of the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) and congress. Noted landmarks of Project 8 are the San Francisco High School (est. 1957), the Toro Hills Elementary School (1958), the Santo Niño Parish Shrine (est. 1964), the Santo Cristo Elementary School (est. 1965), the Quezon City Science High School (est. 1967), Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish (est. 1966), the DSWD Reception & Study Center for Youth and Children (est. 1967), the Lucas R. Pascual Memorial Elementary School (est. 1968), DSWD the Golden Acres Home for the Aged (est. 1969), the Dr. Juanito P. Sioson General Hospital and Colleges (est. 1971), the SM City North EDSA Mall (constructed 1985), the Immaculate Conception Parish School (est. 1988), the Pugad Lawin High School (formerly the Ismael Mathay Sr. High School Annex, est. 1991), the Dr. Montano G. Ramos General Hospital (est. 1997), the Holy Family Parish (est. 2003), the Quezon City Polytechnic University (est. 2006), and the Baesa Cemetery.\n\nAfter the completion of the Homesite Projects in the 1950s, presidents Carlos Polestico Garcia (1896-1971) and Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr. (1910-1997) enacted other housing programs for Manila; such as the Presidential Assistant on Housing and Resettlement Agency (PAHRA), the Tondo Foreshore Development Authority (TFDA), the Central Institute for the Training and Relocation of Urban Squatters (CITRUS), the Presidential Committee for Housing and Urban Resettlement (PRECHUR), and the the Sapang Palay Development Committee (SPDC). However, Pres. Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos Sr. (1917-1989) instituted the National Housing Authority (NHA), which absorbed all these government agencies. And in 1978, the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) under First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos (born 1929) was tasked to implement a more holistic approach to housing with the 1979 Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS). The BLISS program developed the Bagong Lipunan Pag-asa Condominium compound in Project 8.\n\nProjects 1 to 8 continue to evolve as time marches on, while some areas may degrade due to over population of expanding families and migration, economic loss or growth, public infrastructure development, and even natural disasters. However, the Projects will always be integrated into popular culture with the 1973 song “Project” by the Juan Dela Cruz Band. Band members Wally Gonzalez, Mike Hanopol (born 1946), and Joseph William “Pepe” Feliciano Smith (1947-2019) paint a picture of the youth of the projects during the 1970s, which still echoes to the young people living in these communities to this day:\n\nPagsikat palang ng araw\n\nNandiyan na mga barkada\n\nSan mang mga kanto\n\nSila’y nagkikita-kita\n\nNaghahanap ng happening\n\nAt kung anung matitira\n\nKani-kaniyang tirahan\n\nTungkol sa mga ligawan\n\nMeron diyang naba-basted\n\nAt meron ding nakaka-iskor\n\nMeron pang nambobola\n\nAt meron ding nagpapatawa\n\nProject 2, 3, and 4\n\nKaylangan lang umiskor\n\nProject 6, 7, 8\n\nOk ang mga project\n\nPara kang nasa airport\n\nHindi na bumababa\n\nAt di narin inaantok\n\nKanina pag nahihintay\n\nKung kelan darating ang usok\n\nProject 2, 3, and 4\n\nKaylangan lang umiskor\n\nProject 6, 7, 8\n\nOk ang mga project\n\nPara kang nasa airport\n\nHindi na bumababa\n\nAt di narin inaantok\n\nKanina pag nahihintay\n\nKung kelan darating ang usok"
