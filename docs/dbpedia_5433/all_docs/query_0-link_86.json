        "text": "In July 2019, Alyssa Marie Mejia Rogers, a 24-year-old Filipina, was found dead inside a freezer at her home in Arlington, Texas. She was married to Edward Rogers Jr., a 66-year-old man. Together, they had a one-year-old son named Zachary.\n\nAccording to reports, both met and got married in 2017. However, Alyssa did not know about Edward’s long history of violent tendencies. In 2004, Edward pleaded guilty to manslaughter over a work dispute at a pool party.\n\nIn the duration of their relationship, Alyssa confided with her friends and family in the Philippines about Edward’s abusive treatment and grave threats. She later filed for divorce and took their son to the province of Pangasinan, her hometown. She also got a protection order granted by a Texas court.\n\nDespite her friends begging her to stay home, Alyssa came back to the United States, assumingly to finalize her divorce. However, days after her arrival, she got killed.\n\nBefore Alyssa’s body was found, an unnamed person claiming to be a friend of Edward reported to the police about the killing. According to the report, Edward told his friend that he and Alyssa had sex and took a video of it before having a big fight.\n\nIt was not stated if Edward raped Alyssa.\n\nAfter the sex, Edwards told his friend that Alyssa threatened him to use the sex video as evidence that he violated the protection order from the court. It led to a huge argument, which ended badly for Alyssa.\n\nBased on Edward’s unnamed friend’s testimony, Edward pushed Alyssa, and she fell and hit her head. Edward then stashed Alyssa’s lifeless body inside a freezer in his garage and even took photos of it as he sent it to his friend, following eight days after the saddening incident.\n\nAt first, the anonymous complainant didn’t believe Edward, then Edward proved it to him by sending a video of him squeezing Alyssa’s buttocks with no movement coming from her. This became the basis for the unknown friend to report it to the authorities.\n\nThe police quickly went to Alyssa and Edward’s residence, and it confirmed Edward’s unnamed friend’s report that Alyssa’s corpse is inside a freezer. Investigators also found Edward’s lifeless body in their bedroom with a gun-shot wound, which authorities believe was self-inflicted.\n\nAlyssa’s friends and family were deeply devastated upon hearing the gruesome killing that happened to their loved one. They also put up a GoFundMe account to help bring Alyssa’s body home in the Philippines.\n\nA High Profile Murder in the 1940s: The Slaying of Lilian Velez\n\nIn the 1940s, Lilian Velez first came into the limelight when she won an amateur radio singing contest in the mid-30s. Before the outbreak of World War II, her singing career thrived, and she popularized one of her father’s songs, Sa Kabukiran. Velez also won the heart of Jose’ Joe’ Climaco, the radio station manager who had sponsored the contest. They were soon married in 1942 and had one daughter, Vivian, who also became an actress and later a Director General of the Film Academy of the Philippines.\n\nAfter the grueling war, Velez resumed her acting career. She joined LVN Pictures, and with her husband as director, starred in such films as G.I. Fever, Binibiro Lamang Kita, Ang Estudyante, and Sa Kabukiran, inspired by the song that had earlier earned her fame. In some of these films, her leading man was Bernardo “Narding” Anzures, a former child actor and son of actor Miguel Anzures and actress Rosa Aguirre.\n\nAfter Sa Kabukiran, LVN Pictures decided to cast Jaime de la Rosa as Velez’s leading man in her next film. The decision caused distress for Anzures, who had seemingly become obsessed with the married Velez.\n\nOn the evening of June 26, 1948, Anzures paid an unexpected visit to Velez’s residence in Quezon City. Upon his arrival, he stabbed Velez to death and a house helper who had come to her employer’s assistance. The crime was committed within view of Velez’s toddler-daughter, who was fortunately unharmed during the incident.\n\nLater on, Anzures was promptly arrested, tried, and convicted for the murder of Lilian Velez and her maid. The case was considered to be one of the most high profile killings during that time.\n\nDuring his tenure in prison, Anzures contracted tuberculosis and was later pardoned by then-President Elpidio Quirino. About two months after his release, he died; his exact motives for the murder were never fully determined. Though many speculate that it was a crime of passion."
