        "text": "Veteran actor Ronaldo Valdez, or Ronald James Dulaca Gibbs in real life, purportedly committed suicide on Sunday, the Quezon City Police District reported Monday.\n\nThe actor, born on 27 November 1946, was 77 years old and said to have been suffering from depression following a prostate cancer operation last December 2022 at the Cardinal Santos Hospital.\n\nHis body was found by his driver, Angelito Oclarit, lying bloodied on the chair, with one hand still holding a gun, inside his room at his house in New Manila, Quezon City, on Sunday afternoon.\n\nScene of the Crime Operatives from QCPD Forensic Unit led by P/Cpt. Adhrin Domingo said they recovered a caliber .45 Norinco pistol, with an inserted empty magazine, one fired cartridge case, and a gun case containing one empty magazine beside the suicide victim.\n\nFurther examination showed that the actor sustained gunshot wounds on his right and left temple and appeared to have committed suicide.\n\nQCPD Director P/Brig. Gen. Red Maranan said they could not yet confirm that the incident was a suicide until the laboratory test results concurred on it.\n\n\"May inintay pa result ng lab exam from SOCO, before we can conclude,\" Maranan told DAILY TRIBUNE.\n\nValdez's career spanned over six decades, as he is one of the country's most reliable and popular actors in film and on TV.\n\nHis versatility ranged from comedic to dramatic, fatherly to antagonistic performances. His last project was on ABS-CBN's \"2 Good 2 Be True,\" where his portrayal of \"Lolo Sir\" endeared him to younger audiences.\n\nHis list of films includes \"May Minamahal\", \"The Mistress\", and \"Seven Sundays\"."
