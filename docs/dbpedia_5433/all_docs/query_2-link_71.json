        "text": "At least four people were killed, while more than 200 aftershocks followed the quake that took place in the northern Philippine island of Luzon.\n\nA strong earthquake has struck the northern Philippines, killing at least four people, toppling buildings and causing panic among residents.\n\nHere is what we know.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAt 8:43am (00:43 GMT), the mountainous and lightly populated province of Abra in the northern Philippine island of Luzon was hit by an earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake was measured at a preliminary magnitude of 7.1 by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and 7.3 by the Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), which later revised the magnitude down to 7.\n\nThe earthquake was one of the strongest to have hit the country in years.\n\nIt was also felt in the capital, Manila, where several buildings were evacuated, and the city’s metro rail systems were halted at rush hour.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\nAccording to USGS, the epicentre was about 11km (7 miles) southeast of the town of Dolores, in Abra province, at a shallow depth of 10km (6 miles).\n\nHow many casualties?\n\nAt least five people died.\n\nTwo people were killed in Benguet province; one in Abra province; and one more in another province, Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos told a news conference. Sixty people were injured, he said.\n\nThe man killed in Abra was hit by falling cement slabs in his house. At least 25 others were injured in the province.\n\nA construction worker was also hit by debris and died in the strawberry-growing mountain town of La Trinidad in Benguet province, where some roads were shut by landslides and boulders.\n\nIs it safe now? And what is next?\n\nRenato Solidum, director of the state seismology agency, told the DZRH radio station that strong aftershocks were expected.\n\n“The focus of attention is on Abra and nearby provinces,” Solidum said.\n\nThe earthquake was followed by more than 200 aftershocks, the local seismological agency informed.\n\nSeveral of the subsequent earthquakes measured from magnitude 4.7 to 4.9, according to the USGS.\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr ordered rescue and relief teams to be sent to Abra. The newly elected president is also expected to travel to the epicentre on Thursday.\n\nPhilippine Red Cross first aid teams are on the ground.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Barnaby Lo, reporting from Manila, said classes were suspended in the affected areas.\n\nNational disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said road clearing operations were under way.\n\nAccording to a CNN report, state seismologists said there were no risks of a tsunami because the earthquake was located on land.\n\nPhotos\n\nSource : Al Jazeera and news agencies\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo"
