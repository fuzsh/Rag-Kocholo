        "text": "I first heard the name Anne Curtis in 2015, when I was visiting Angeles City, a centre of the south-east Asian sex tourism industry a couple of hours’ drive north of Manila. I was researching a story about the abandoned children of Australian sex tourists.\n\nIn Angeles City, there is a cafe set up to resemble a 1950s country-town milk bar that sells Aussie burgers. There are pubs that stream AFL football and serve VB and XXXX on beer mats advertising DNA testing services – aimed at the men who are told they have fathered a child and want to be sure.\n\nThere’s even a sub-branch of the RSL with about 600 members. When I visited in 2015, the president was James Curtis-Smith, a then-73-year-old retired lawyer from Yarrawonga. He is Anne’s father. He happily agreed to be interviewed, turning up to my hotel up on a scooter in a bright green polo shirt with a boxing kangaroo on the pocket.\n\nThen and now, James Curtis-Smith is the enemy of woke. The attraction of the Philippines, he told me in 2015, apart from living well on the cheap, was that attitudes were “better”. You could compliment a woman without getting into trouble. He happily talked about the pattern in which older Western men, often widowers or divorcees in their 50s and 60s, ended up marrying the “entirely delightful” younger Filipino women. “The Filipina girl or woman is the most domestic type. They want a home, they want babies, they want to be homemakers and all these old guys love that,” he said.\n\nHe was an example of the pattern. He met Anne’s mother on a visit to Manila. “The waitress at the hotel I was staying at was particularly attractive, and one thing led to another,” he told me in that 2015 interview. At the end of our talk, he mentioned that his daughter Anne was “rather famous”. Online research that night alerted me to just how famous she was.\n\nCurtis-Smith already had children with his first wife, an Australian. He would marry Carmencita Ojales, Anne’s mother, bringing her back to Yarrawonga, and father another three. That marriage ended, and he married another Filipino, adopting two of her children, and fathering another two, one of whom died in infancy. Today, Curtis-Smith lives with his most recent family in Angeles City.\n\nThe difference between Curtis-Smith and too many others was that he stood by his children – all of them – sending them to private schools and staying in their lives. In the context of Angeles City, he was a moral giant. He gave free legal help to women pursuing the fathers of their children for child support. Anne recalls that he’d call them at dinner time, knowing they would be with their families. It helped encourage quiet and quick settlement.\n\nAnne was born in 1985. Her mother had opened a shop in Yarrawonga selling fried chicken. Her early memories are of “the best childhood imaginable”. She attended a Catholic primary school, learnt to ride her bike on dirt roads, went camping with the family on weekends and remembers rushing home on school days to watch Home and Away. “I suppose like most kids I dreamed that one day I may get a role in it.”\n\nThey returned to the Philippines at least once a year to visit family. When Anne was 12 and her father was preparing for retirement, they planned to relocate there. As they prepared for that move – checking out schools for Anne – they stopped at a Jollibee fast food outlet in metro Manila where Anne was spotted by a talent scout and offered work in advertisements.\n\nHer first screen role was in a Mitsubishi advert in which she was an angelic child buckling her belt in the backseat. Her first film role was Princess Dahlia in the 1997 fantasy cult classic Magic Kingdom. Erik Matti, then a junior student assistant in charge of auditions, remembers she stood out among the more than 100 children queuing up to try out for the role. “Her stance … was princess-like. And I was looking for a princess, so she was perfect.“\n\nShe got the role despite not speaking the Filipino language, Tagalog. Her voice had to be dubbed. After that, her career took off. She studied Tagalog intensively and took acting workshops. Acting, says Curtis, “triggered something in me … It is my passion.”\n\nCurtis used to carry a portable mattress, so she could catch snatches of sleep on set.\n\nThe Filipino film industry works at a frantic pace. Until she became pregnant in 2019, Curtis made at least one movie each year, and usually two or three, as well as numerous television roles and, since 2009, It’s Showtime (she’s recorded more than 3800 episodes). Piñera recalls she used to carry a portable mattress, so she could catch snatches of sleep on set. Her sweet, “hardly ever grumpy” persona, Piñera says, hides a steely determination and dedication.\n\nMost of Curtis’s roles have been lightweight romantic comedies. She has won numerous local acting awards, but not broken into the Western market. Through all this, Curtis avoided controversy, refusing requests to comment on politics. But, in 2017, she took a different tack.\n\nErik Matti was now head of his own production company and a fierce critic of the then Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, who had been elected in 2016 on a promise of tackling the country’s drug problem with a “war on drugs”. Matti approached Curtis’s agency, seeking stars for his latest project. Even the title – BuyBust – was provocative. It was the term used to describe operations in which police would go undercover to conduct a drug deal and arrest the dealers. Routinely, such operations ended with the accused shot dead. The standard explanation was “the suspect fought back”.\n\nAt the time Matti was recruiting, there were dozens of deaths each night. In all, according to the International Criminal Court prosecutor who is presently investigating the deaths, up to 30,000 citizens were killed. Perhaps not surprisingly, Matti had trouble finding a star for the film. Curtis’s agency told him nobody was available for a film that was, he recalls, “too dark, too full of action, too long, too expensive and perhaps too political”.\n\nBut four months later, he took a call. Anne Curtis was interested. She was bored with doing romances. In this movie, Matti warned Curtis, she would not be pretty. There would be no glamour and no laughs. Her face would be distorted with blood and bruises.\n\nShe poured herself into the role. She was the biggest star on the set but, says Matti, she “made mistakes, was interested in fixing the mistakes, and she was humble”. BuyBust was set in the country’s worst slums: Tondo in the Manila port district. The filmmakers were warned not to film there for fear of theft and violence, so their set recreated the neon-lit, labyrinthine hellhole. Curtis played rookie police officer Nina Manigan, who becomes the only survivor of her squad as her colleagues are slaughtered in a miasma of brutality, corruption and betrayal, surrounded by the fury of slum dwellers grieving their dead.\n\nIt was gruelling – filming overnight under cascades of rain. Curtis vomited multiple times on set. “Erik wanted a continuous shot,” she says. “I had to climb up a roof, do a fight scene, climb back down again, climb back up again and fall down.” She had studied parkour as part of rigorous physical and weapons training for the role. She was fit, but “I think we did 56 takes of that across two nights. It took me to the edge.” (Each morning, often without sleep, she would turn up – all smiles and energy – to co-host three hours of It’s Showtime.)\n\nIn the last scene of BuyBust, Curtis’s character realises that she is about to be killed, wrestles for a gun and shoots her colleague. Her last words are “The suspect fought back”, which in the context of the time was a powerful political statement. The camera pulls back into an overhead shot of the slum, showing roofs littered with corpses.\n\nCurtis nominates BuyBust as the favourite of her movies, largely because of its political message. Human rights advocates in the Philippines frequently reference the movie. Yet, says Matti, neither he nor Curtis have paid a political price, nor does he think it has made a difference. It is a characteristic of the country, he says, that “people just carry on. They just turn a blind eye.”\n\nIn December 2019, Curtis and husband Heussaff flew to Australia for Dahlia’s birth. Curtis needed to retreat and to rest, which was only possible outside the Philippines – and she wanted the support of her mother. Curtis gave birth in early March 2020. She had planned to stay a few months more, but then the first COVID-19 lockdown hit. They were trapped in Melbourne.\n\nAn immense effort went into keeping her audience connected through social media. In one video, Heussaff attempted to placate his wife’s apparent craving for Jollibee by cooking her and her mother an imitation of that outlet’s trademark sweet spaghetti and Chickenjoy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philippines suffered one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in the world, and COVID spread like wildfire through the slums. Curtis’s homecoming was front-page news. On May 28, 2022, she returned to It’s Showtime: introduced by Ganda as “my sister” and revealed to the audience reclining and singing Ariana Grande’s Break Free. A few words in, she broke down with nerves, squealing in apparent panic. Undaunted, she did a second take, belting the lyrics out in her strange voice. This is the part where I’m stronger than I have ever been before, she sang. The audience loved it. Everybody cried.\n\nAt the last national elections in 2022, Curtis appeared at a campaign event for presidential candidate Leni Robredo, a long-time human rights lawyer and social activist who as vice-president under Duterte had been the effective leader of the opposition.\n\nCurtis had posted to social media a picture of a rose that had been grown by her mother in Melbourne. It was, she said, called “a mother’s love” and was apt because Robredo would take care of the country like her own child. But in June 2022, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos – son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the country between the 1960s and his overthrow in a 1986 popular rebellion, and aligned with Duterte – was elected with an overwhelming mandate.\n\nCurtis says she doesn’t regret her advocacy. “At that point you could feel the energy, you could feel the want of every single person in the country wanting change.” So why did they vote for Marcos? “I don’t know. I was very, very hopeful alongside others. And now, I don’t want to speak about that any more because it’s actually very heartbreaking.“\n\nIt would be a mistake to cast Anne Curtis as an activist. She is cautious talking about politics. Doubtless some of the brands she endorses would prefer she did not. She rejects the suggestion that It’s Showtime’s recent trouble might have to do with her stance.\n\nAnd yet, increasingly, Asia’s sweetheart stands for something. She is working with Matti on a sequel to BuyBust, as a television series contracted by a streaming platform. It will pick up on Curtis’s character five years later in, as Matti puts it, “a dystopian world of the Philippines, now on the road to becoming a First World country. The pressure is on for the government to discipline the whole country so that we can compete with the likes of Singapore, Japan, Korea.” Pre-production has started and Curtis is training with weapons and knives.\n\nBut Curtis has no plans to leave It’s Showtime anytime soon. The audience keeps her there. She loves the connection, hearing their stories, watching the show’s cash prizes change lives. Before her daughter Dahlia’s birth, she said that if she had children, she would want to raise them in Australia. That has changed.\n\nShe visits Melbourne at least twice a year, but the Philippines is home. And she has promised her audience that she will not leave them again."
