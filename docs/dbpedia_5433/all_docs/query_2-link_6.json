        "text": "1. AJ PEREZ\n\nHe was: 19 years old\n\nBest known for: His role as Candido de Dios, a lead character in the TV adaptation of the 1980s drama flick, Sabel.\n\nDied: April 17, 2011\n\nCause of death: The car he was in collided with another vehicle along MacArthur Highway in Moncada, Tarlac.\n\nAJ Perez was a rare gem in today’s generation of Philippine showbiz. The boy not only had the charm, but also the ability to transform into a versatile actor. While his first shot at fame was in Sabel, AJ also became popular in movies such as Cinco, Mamarazzi, and in the Maalaala Mo Kaya episode “Tsinelas.” Sadly, the fresh-faced teenager was declared dead due to multiple head and neck injuries as a result of a car accident while on the way home from a show in Dagupan, Pangasinan. AJ’s corneas were later donated to two different recipients not long after his death.\n\n2. MELODY GERSBACH\n\nShe was: 24 years old\n\nBest known for: Representing the Philippines in the 2009 Miss International Pageant in Macau.\n\nDied: August 21, 2010\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nHalf-German, half-Pinay Melody Gersbach was crowned Bb. Pilipinas-International 2009, and represented the country in the Miss International pageant that same year. She also had an acting stint when she was cast as a leading lady of Aga Muhlach in a TV show. Sadly, her life and career were cut short when she was instantly killed in a vehicular collision in Bula, Camarines Sur.\n\n3. HALINA PEREZ\n\nShe was: 21 years old\n\nBest known for: Roles in erotic films like Ikapitong Gloria, Balat Sibuyas, and Kirot sa Dibdib.\n\nDied: March 4, 2004\n\nCause of death: Neck injuries due to a car crash\n\nHalina Perez rose to fame at a time when Pinoy erotic flicks were about to fade. But her innocent face and voluptuous figure still captured the eyes of many. The 21-year-old was on her way home from a show in Legazpi, Albay, in the early morning of March 24, 2004 when the car she was in crashed. Halina died of neck injuries as a result of the accident. Her manager, Isah Munio, was also killed instantly, while the other passengers in the car, including fellow B-actress Danna Garcel, survived.\n\n4. RIC SEGRETO\n\nHe was: 45 years old\n\nBest known for: Timeless OPM classics such as “Don’t Know What to Say” and “Give Me a Chance.”\n\nDied: September 6, 1998\n\nCause of death: Multiple injuries from a motorcycle crash\n\nWho does not sing along to the popular 1980s ballad, “Don’t Know What to Say”? The man behind the voice, Ric Segreto, was among the most respected singer-songwriters during his heyday, and even when he started to disappear from the limelight. The Fil-Am singer, brother of fellow musician Geoff Macaraeg, was likewise an avid biker. Unfortunately, he was killed while traversing the Buendia Avenue/Edsa flyover. Ric was riding his motorcycle during that time.\n\n5. WILLIE GARTE\n\nBest known for: Hit songs “Bawal na Gamot” and “Nasaan ang Liwanag.”\n\nDied: September 6, 1998\n\nCause of death: Run over by a trailer-truck\n\nHe may have not have died in a car, but Willie Garte was killed on the road, literally. The blind singer, who became popular for his songs “Bawal na Gamot” and “Nasaan ang Liwanag,” was crossing Edsa in Malibay, Pasay City, when he was run over by a trailer-truck on the midnight of September 6, 1998.\n\n6. ERUEL TONGCO\n\nBest known for: Being the original “Gary” in the hit soap opera, “Mara Clara.”\n\nDied: 1996\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nMany may have forgotten his real name, but Eruel Tongco remains to be a legend for playing the original “Gary” in the soap opera, “Mara Clara”. Father of former child-star-turned-pastor LA Lopez, Eruel started out his career in showbiz by being one of “Alfie’s Boys,” a group managed by Alfie Lorenzo (Cesar Montano is an alum of Alfie’s Boys too). But he found his big break when he took on the role of the shrewd and cruel Gary Davis, who did nothing but make his daughter’s life Mara, miserable until the very end. Eruel was at the height of his “Mara Clara” fame when he met his untimely death in the middle of 1996, when his car crashed in a highway in Batangas. His character was unceremoniously snipped out of the soap, and was replaced by William Martinez in the film version. His role was later brought back to life by Jong Hilario in the soap’s 2010 reboot.\n\n7. JON HERNANDEZ\n\nHe was: 24 years old\n\nBest known for: Teeny-bopper roles in Bagets 2, Row 4: Baliktoryans, and Sambahin ang Ngalan Mo.\n\nDied: November 7, 1993\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nJon Hernandez came from two of the most respected showbiz clans in the country. His mother was veteran actress Alicia Alonzo, while his maternal uncle was Anthony Alonzo. His father is Ross Rival, which made him him half-brother to Maja Salvador and nephew to Philip Salvador, Alona Alegre, and Deborah Sun. But Jonjon, as he was fondly called, made a name for himself as a young matinee idol in flicks such as Bagets 2, Jockey Tiyan, and Prinsesang Gusgusin, where he starred alongside Lotlot de Leon, now Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista, and other teenage stars during that time. Jonjon retired from show business in 1993. However, nobody expected that he would retire from life as well on the same year. On the way home from an out-of-town excursion with friends, Jonjon’s car hit a concrete obstruction in a highway in Quezon City, where he was killed instantly.\n\n8. JAY ILAGAN\n\nHe was: 38 years old\n\nBest known for: His roles in Soltero, Salawahan, Kisapmata, and Sister Stella L.\n\nDied: February 3, 1992\n\nCause of death: Motorcycle accident\n\nOne of the most prolific actors in the history of Philippine Cinema, Jay Ilagan was best known for two things: for being the original Soltero, and one of the fab four in Bad Bananas. Jay, whose famous ancestor was theater guru Hermogenes Ylagan, began his career as a child actor in 1964, and from there he became a regular face in show business. He made a name for himself in movies such as Tatlo, Dalawa, Isa, Kakabakaba Ka Ba?, Pabling, and Maging Akin Ka Lamang. Jay was also married to actress Hilda Koronel, and was a common-law husband to Amy Austria at the time of his death.\n\n9. LINO BROCKA\n\nHe was: 52 years old.\n\nBest known for: Directing critically acclaimed films such as Insiang, Maynila Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, Bona, and Gumapang Ka sa Lusak\n\nDied: May 21, 1991\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nDirector Lino Brocka was a pioneer not only of cinematic masterpieces, but of upholding the rights of the LGBT community in the country. His name rose to fame after creating one critically acclaimed flick to another, most of which depicting the moral and social struggles of the Filipino society at the height of Martial Law. Brocka;was also among the first Filipino filmmakers to have works nominated in Cannes Film Festival, with Insiang and Jaguar. On the night of May 21, 1991, Lino met his untimely death when the car he was on hit an electric post along East Avenue, Quezon City, after leaving a show hosted by singer Malu Barry. The driver of the car was actor William Lorenzo, who was also severely injured but survived the crash.\n\n10. CLAUDIA ZOBEL\n\nShe was: 19 years old\n\nBest known for: Starring in erotic mainstream films Shame and Sinner or Saint.\n\nDied: February 10, 1984\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nClaudia Zobel’s was skyrocketing at the age of 19. The seductive starlet, whose acting chops were first discovered in Brocka’s Kapit sa Patalim, chose to take daring, skin-baring roles instead. Her first starring role, Shame, was banned in some cinemas due to its sexually explicit content. The 19-year-old, who was still learning how to drive that night of February 10, 1984, took on the wheel with her friends and sped along the Magallanes interchange, and lost control of the vehicle and crashed. Claudia made headlines just a few months ago when it was discovered that her remains have not yet decayed after being buried for almost 30 years.\n\n11. EDDIE PEREGRINA\n\nHe was: 32 years old.\n\nBest known for: His high-pitched Pinoy ballads such as “Together Again.” and “What Am I Living For.”\n\nDied: April 30, 1977\n\nCause of death: Car accident\n\nBefore there was an Erik Santos, Jed Madela, or Jovit Baldivino, there was Eddie Peregrina. A champ of the hit singing contest “Tawag ng Tanghalan,” Eddie rose to fame for his high-pitched ballads and matinee idol roles during the 1960s and 1970s. He also starred in a few films and was paired with no less than Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos, and later he married actress Lynn Salazar. The 32-year-old singer was driving his car at the Edsa-Shaw Boulevard underpass when it collided with a trailer truck. Eddie stayed in the hospital for a month and a week before succumbing to internal hemorrhage.\n\nPhoto: Screengrab from the movie Coed starring Jay Ilagan."
