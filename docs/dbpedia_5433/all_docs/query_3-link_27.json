        "text": "Quezon City (also known to Filipinos by its initials as QC) is the most populous city in the Philippines. It is one of the cities that make up Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City was named after Manuel L. Quezon, second President of the Philippines, who founded the city and developed it to replace the City of Manila as the national capital for 28 years from 1948 to 1976.[1] Quezon City is not located in and should not be confused with Quezon Province, which was also named after the mayor. It is currently the largest city in Metro Manila in terms of land area.\n\nHaving been the national capital for almost three decades, Quezon City is the site of many government offices, including the Batasang Pambansa Complex, which is the seat of the House of Representatives (the lower chamber of the Philippine Congress).[1] Quezon City also holds the University of the Philippines Diliman, the national university, and Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBefore Quezon City was created, it was composed of small individual towns of San Francisco del Monte, Novaliches, and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the Katipunan led by its Supremo Andrés Bonifacio, launched the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire in the house of Melchora Aquino in Pugad Lawin (now known as Bahay Toro, Project 8).\n\nIn the early 20th century, President Manuel L. Quezon dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip to Mexico influenced his vision.[2][3]\n\nIn 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/ from the vast Diliman estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as Barrio Obrero (\"Workers' Village\"). The National Assembly of the Philippine Commonwealth passed Commonwealth Act 502 known as the Charter of Quezon City originally proposed as \"Balintawak City\", Assemblymen Narciso Ramos and Ramon Mitra, Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.[2][3]\n\nAfter the war, Republic Act No. 333 which redefined the Caloocan–Quezon City boundary was signed by Elpidio Quirino on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the republic's capital, and specifying the city's area to be Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/. The barrios of Baes, Talipapá, San Bartolomé, Pasong Tamó, Novaliches Población, Banlát, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, and Pasong Putik which belonged to Novaliches and had a combined area of about 8,100 hectares, were taken from Caloocan and ceded to Quezon City. This caused the territorial division of Caloocan into two non-contiguous parts, the South section being the more urbanized part, and the North half being sub-rural. On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city's boundaries to an area of Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/.[2][3]\n\nExactly six years after on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city's land area were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/. The website of the Quezon City government states that its present area is Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/ On October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the \"Thrilla in Manila\" fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. On November 7, 1975 the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President Ferdinand Marcos established Metro Manila.[2][3]\n\nQuezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to Manila on June 24, 1976. On March 31, 1978, President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Manuel L. Quezon from Manila North Cemetery to the completed Quezon Memorial Monument within Elliptical Road. On February 22, 1986, the Quezon City portion of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo) became the venue of the bloodless People Power Revolution that overthrew Marcos. On February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President Fidel V. Ramos.[2][3]\n\nThe Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon city. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches. Quezon City is the first local government in the Philippines with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system that now contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.[2][3]\n\nMaster plans[]\n\nIn 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. Manila was getting crowded, and his military advisors (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by naval guns in case of attack–a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.[2][3]\n\nQuezon railroaded the idea of anew city at least Template:Convert/kmTemplate:Convert/track/abbr/onTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/ away from Manila Bay (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted William E. Parsons, American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with Juan Arellano, engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.[2][3]\n\nThe plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a 400 ha central green, about the size of New York's Central Park, and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a 25-hectare elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the Philippine Legislature and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.[2][3]\n\nOn either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been built the new Malacañan Palace on North Avenue (the present-day Veterans Memorial Hospital), and the Supreme Court Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government would finally and efficiently be located close to one another.[2][3]\n\nGeography[]\n\nThe city lies on the Guadalupe plateau which is a relatively high plateau on the northeast corner of the metropolis – between the lowlands of Manila to the southwest and the Marikina River valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the very narrow San Juan River and its tributaries to Pasig River, while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally narrow Tullahan River.\n\nQuezon City is bordered by Manila to the southwest, by Caloocan and Valenzuela City to the west and northwest. To the south lies San Juan and Mandaluyong, while Marikina and Pasig borders Quezon City to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies San Jose del Monte in the province of Bulacan and to the east lies Rodriguez and San Mateo, both in the province of Rizal.\n\nThe city can be divided into a number of areas. The southern portion of the city is divided into a number of places including Diliman, Commonwealth, the Project areas, Cubao, Kamias, Kamuning, New Manila, San Francisco del Monte, and Santa Mesa Heights. The northern half of the city is often called Novaliches and contains the areas of Fairview and Lagro. Most of these areas have no defined boundaries and are primarily residential in nature.\n\nClimate[]\n\nQuezon City features a tropical monsoon climate, with warm weather and dry and wet seasons.\n\nTemplate:Weather box\n\nEconomy[]\n\nThe commercial center of the city is in Cubao where many shopping malls and the Aurora Tower can be found. There is a farmers' plaza and farmers' market. Fiesta Carnival was an enclosed amusement park cum carnival which is located in the heart of the Cubao Commercial Center, it has since been replaced by a branch of Shopwise, a local supermarket chain. the Smart Araneta Coliseum is a venue for concerts as well as sports events.\n\nQuezon City is home to the Philippines' major broadcasting networks. Television companies such as ABS-CBN, RPN, GMA Network, INC TV, UNTV, Net 25, PTV, and IBC all have their headquarters in Quezon City. TV5 also had its headquarters in Quezon City since 1992, but it moved out to Mandaluyong City in 2013. However, its transmitter in Novaliches is still being used and operated by the network.[4]\n\nTomas Morato and Timog Avenues are the heart of a restaurant and entertainment row with a wide array of prices, cultures, and flavors while Banawe Avenue is dubbed as the Autoparts Capital of the Philippines[5] and home to clusters of authentic Chinese restaurants aside from Binondo. The tallest building in the city is a 40 storey Eastwood Parkview located in Eastwood City.[6]\n\nQuezon City's communication system is powered by the PLDT, Globe Telecom, BayanTel, and others. Cellular networking in the Philippines, particularly the metropolitan areas, is increasing rapidly together with the low cost of calls and text messaging. Such big companies that control the cellular networks in the Philippines and Quezon City itself are Globe Telecom, Smart Communications (PLDT) and Sun Cellular from Digitel. Digitel has its main headquarters along Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr. Avenue (C-5) in Bagumbayan.\n\nEastwood City is a business district developed by Megaworld Corporation in Bagumbayan, Quezon City. Citibank Philippines, IBM Philippines, NEC Philippines, Canon Philppines and Mercury Drug Corporation are some of the companies headquartered in the cyberpark within Eastwood City.\n\nEducation[]\n\nThe city has several major educational institutions. Two of the most well-known are the University of the Philippines Diliman and the Ateneo de Manila University. Also in Quezon City are medical schools such as the Our Lady of Fátima University, Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, Capitol Medical Center Colleges, and the UERMMMC College of Medicine.

In its place, a 22 kilometer rail system will be built. The MRT-7 project will commence at North Avenue, connecting the MRT-3 at its northern terminus. It will then go through Commonwealth Avenue, then through Regalado, Quirino Highway, ending in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The system has a proposed spur line to connect itself to LRT-2 in Katipunan, passing through the University of the Philippines Diliman and Katipunan Avenue.\n\nA elevated Automated Guideway Transit system is currently under construction in UP Diliman.\n\nThe following elevated railway stations in the city (Only 13 Stations):\n\nMRT-3 (with 5 Stations):\n\nNorth Avenue- (Connected to LRT-1)\n\nQuezon Avenue\n\nKamuning\n\nAraneta Center-Cubao- (Connected to MRT-2)\n\nSantolan\n\nLRT-2 (with 5 Stations):\n\nGilmore\n\nBetty Go-Belmonte\n\nAraneta Center-Cubao- (Connected to MRT-3)\n\nAnonas\n\nKatipunan\n\nLRT-1 (with 3 Stations)\n\nBalintawak\n\nRoosevelt\n\nNorth Avenue- (Connected to MRT-3)\n\nPublic transport[]\n\nPublic transportation within the city, like in most of the urban areas in the Philippines, is facilitated mostly using inexpensive jeepneys and buses.

A number of religious orders have set up convents and seminaries in the city. Various Protestant faiths have seen a significant increase in membership over recent decades[7][8] and are well represented in Quezon City. While the Islamic faith has its largest concentrations in the south of the Philippines, there is a significant population in Quezon City. The Salam compound in Barangay Culiat houses one of the area's landmark mosques. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the Manila Philippines Temple and the Missionary Training Center located at Temple Drive Greenmeadows Subdivision of the city.

Its main feature is a mausoleum containing the remains of Manuel L. Quezon, the second President of the Philippines, and his wife, First Lady Aurora Quezon.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Quezon City is governed by a mayor and vice mayor elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the city ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads the legislative council consisting of 24 members. These councilors represent the six (6) legislative districts of the city. The council is in charge of formulating and enacting city ordinances.\n\nQuezon City, being a part of the Metro Manila region, has its mayor in the Metro Manila Council headed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). This council formulates development plans that seeks to solve the problems and improve the conditions in the metropolis.\n\nQuezon City is made up of 142 barangays (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into the aforementioned legislative districts. Each district, in turn is represented in the House of Representatives.\n\nSee also: Barangays of Quezon City\n\nMayors[]\n\nMain article: List of mayors of Quezon City\n\nPresident Manuel L. Quezon acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, Tomas B. Morato. Since a president can, under Philippine law, hold multiple portfolios inferior to his office, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.\n\nPublic order and safety[]\n\nPeace and order, which includes traffic management of the city is administered by the Quezon City Department of Public Order and Safety,[9] whose offices are found inside the Quezon City Hall Complex,[10] is headed by retired QCPD District Director - Police Chief Superintendent Elmo San Diego.[9]\n\nEmergency management for the city is administered by the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council headed by Mayor Herbert Bautista[11] and Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Office[12] headed by its administrator; Dr. Noel Lansang.[10] The QCDRRMO will move out of the DPOS Building once construction of the QCDRRMO Building, near Gate 7 of the City Hall Complex, is completed 4th Quarter of 2014.[12]\n\nThe National Headquarters of the Philippine National Police[13] is located inside Camp Rafael Crame in Santolan, Quezon City and National Headquarters of the Bureau of Fire Protection[14] is located in Agham road, Quezon City. Supporting the PNP in administration, rehabilitation and protection of prisoners within the city is the Quezon City Jail and is ran by Officers and Enlisted Personnel of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology.[15] The BJMP National Headquarters is located along Mindanao Avenue in Project 8.[16]\n\nThe Quezon City Police District[17] of the National Capital Region Police Office[18] is responsible for law enforcement in the city. Police structure within Quezon City is centralized and its command center found inside Camp Karingal, Kamuning, Quezon City.[17] The QCPD Police sectors are divided to twelve (12) stations.[19]\n\nThe Quezon City Fire District is a division of the Bureau of Fire Protection National Capital Region[20] which provides fire and emergency services to the city. Similarly, there are nineteen (19) fire sub-stations strategically located within the city. District Headquarters are located inside the Quezon City Hall Complex.[10]\n\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines'[21] General Headquarters[22] is in Camp Emilio Aguinaldo[23] in Murphy, Quezon City. The AFP Joint Task Force NCR[24] is also housed inside Camp Aguinaldo. Several reserve units of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which include the 1502nd Infantry Brigade (Ready Reserve), 201st Infantry Battalion (Ready Reserve),[25] 202nd Infantry Battalion (Ready Reserve) of the Army Reserve Command[26] and the 11th Air Force Group (Reserve)[27] of the Air Force Reserve Command[28] are also found in Quezon City and may render assistance to this local government unit during emergencies.[29] The 105th Technical & Administrative Services Group (Reserve), specifically the 1st Technical & Administrative Services Unit (Ready Reserve) of the AFP Reserve Command[30] provide technical assistance to these maneuver units. Collectively, these units function similar to that of the US National Guard.\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary,[31] 106th Coast Guard Auxiliary Squadron,[32] provides water search and rescue capabilities to disaster response agencies of Quezon City. It is headquartered at Barangay Quirino 2-C.\n\nSub-divisions (districts)[]\n\nQuezon City is divided into six districts, in turn subdivided in a total of 142 barangays. Each district is represented by six City Councilors, six representatives/congressmen, one from each district are elected as members of the National Legislature. The number of barangays per district is: District I, 37; District II, 5; District III, 37; District IV, 38; District V, 14; and District VI, 11; Although District II has the least number of barangays, it is the biggest in land area, including the Novaliches Reservoir.\n\nThe La Mesa Ecopark in Novaliches is the last forest of its size in the metropolis, the La Mesa Dam is an earth dam whose reservoir can hold up to 50.5 million cubic meters and occupying an area of Template:Convert/km²Template:Convert/track/abbr/outTemplate:Convert/track/disp/Template:Convert/track/adj/, it is also part of the Angat–Ipo–La Mesa water system which supplies most of the water supply of Metro Manila.\n\nDiliman[]\n\nDiliman, located at the center of southern Quezon City, is where many government offices, including City Hall, are located. Diliman is home to several educational institutions such as the University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City Polytechnic University at Sto. Cristo, Claret School of Quezon City, Diliman Preparatory School, FEU–FERN College, School of the Holy Spirit, Philippine Science High School Main Campus, Quezon City Science High School, the regional science high school in NCR, St. Mary's College of Quezon City, Quezon City High School, Don Alejandro Roces Science and Technology High School among others.\n\nAt the center of Diliman lies the Quezon Memorial Circle, where the late President Manuel L. Quezon is interred. Around the monument is the two-kilometer Quezon Memorial Circle, also known as the Elliptical Road (R-7/C-5).\n\nThe Quezon City Hall, one of the tallest city halls in the country, is located along the Circle. Surrounding the city hall are spacious parks and open areas. The head offices of some national government agencies are located in Diliman.\n\nNear the Circle are many important health centers and institutions. Along East Avenue stand the Philippine Heart Center, the East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC), the National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Philippine Mental Health Association. Connecting with East Avenue is Victoriano Luna Avenue where the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center is located. Along North Avenue is the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) and the Philippine Medical Association. The Philippine Children's Medical Center and Lung Center of the Philippines are located along Quezon Avenue (R-7).\n\nDiliman is also home to the headquarters of most of the country's national television networks, most notably ABS-CBN, the first and largest television network in the country.[33][34] The headquarters of GMA Network, which is also one of the largest television networks in the country, is also located in Diliman. PTV, IBC, and PBS also hold headquarters in Diliman.\n\nMost of the rest of the area is residential. Some villages in this portion of Diliman are Teachers Village, U.P. Village, and Sikatuna Village. Those closer to the University of the Philippines campus such as Teachers Village and U.P. Village remain mostly residential although there are two major secondary schools in the area namely Claret School of Quezon City and Holy Family School of Quezon City, and many have converted spare rooms into boarding facilities for out-of-town students attending schools in the area: U.P., Ateneo, and Miriam College. The eastern edge of the Diliman area is roughly bound by Katipunan Avenue which passes in front of Ateneo and Miriam and runs behind the U.P. Diliman campus.\n\nCommonwealth Ave.[]\n\nNorth of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so named because of Commonwealth Avenue (R-7) (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue) which runs through its center. Barangays in this area include Batasan Hills, Barangay Commonwealth, Holy Spirit and Old Balara. This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions (residential associations), among these are Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the present location of the Quezon Memorial Circle,[35] but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the Commission on Audit of the Philippines, the Sandiganbayan, a special court with a rank equivalent to the Court of Appeals and the Batasang Pambansa Complex, which houses the lower house of the Philippine Congress. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the School of the Holy Spirit, Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in Metro Manila, with kilometers of shanty houses aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.\n\nTandang Sora[]\n\nTemplate:For\n\nThis is located between Commonwealth to the east, North Ave to the south, San Francisco del Monte (Frisco) Avenue to the west, and Fairview–Sauyo to the north. It takes its name from the \"Grand Old Lady of the Revolution\", Melchora Aquino or Tandang Sora, whose remains lie at the Tandang Sora National Shrine on Banlat Road, Barangay Tandang Sora.\n\nThe area is primarily residential with Projects 6 and 8 located here, as are other subdivisions, like Town & Country Gardenville, San Pedro Subdivisions, National Power Corporation or NPC Village, National Irrigation Administration or NIA Village, Reymar Subdivision, Philand Subdivision, Villa Corrina, San Miguel Village, Gloria Subdivisions, Jem Subdivisions, Corazonville subdivision, Villa Concepcion, Villa Lourdes and many more. A large portion of Tandang Sora district is Barangay Bahay Toro, where a historic site of the Philippine Revolution known as Pugad Lawin is located. There are some industrial facilities especially near the Mindanao Avenue area. Culiat, a Muslim compound, is also to be found here, as are the central offices of the Iglesia ni Cristo, New Era University and the studios and transmitter of Net 25 INC TV 49, Radyo Agila, Pinas FM and INC Radio of the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation and Christian Era Broadcasting Service. The transmitter of GMA Network and Barangay LS 97.1 is located near Culiat. Many educational centers are also within the area. Also in the area are Congressional Avenue, Visayas Avenue, and Mindanao Avenue (forming part of C-5).\n\nLoyola Heights[]\n\nLoyola Heights, to the southeast of Diliman is Marikina City's gateway to Quezon City. The Aurora Boulevard (R-6) and Katipunan Avenue (C-5) provide easy access, but often experience traffic jams during rush hours. Also located in Loyola Heights is the Katipunan Station of the Manila LRT Line 2 (LRT-2), which runs in an east-west direction, providing rapid access to the cities of Manila, Quezon City, Marikina and Pasig, and San Juan.

Across Katipunan, the main thoroughfare of the area, are Varsity Hills and Xavierville, both upper class and upper middle-class subdivisions. Near these areas, and right beside La Vista, are some squatters' settlements, making the Loyola Heights area a place of mixed socio-economic classes.\n\nCubao[]\n\nCubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area. At its heart is the Araneta Center along EDSA (C-4) and Aurora Boulevard (R-6). It is a 35-hectare commercial estate owned and developed by the Araneta family. Department stores and retail centers can also be found here, such as Gateway Mall, Plaza Fair, Rustan's, Shopwise Supercenter, SM Cubao, Ali Mall, and Farmer's Plaza. At the center is Smart Araneta Coliseum, often called the Big Dome. Many musical concerts, ice shows, circus shows, religious crusades, wrestling, cockfighting, and basketball games are held in this 20,000-capacity coliseum. In the outskirts of Araneta Center is the Cubao Expo,[36] an artists' colony and site of weekend flea markets. It is also a home to call centers like APAC, Telus,[37] and Stellar.[38] Stellar (Stellar Philippines Inc.)[39] recently moved out of its Cubao site and moved to Eastwood City in 2010.\n\nCubao is also the home of the Cubao Cathedral the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao.

The Eastwood City Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5). Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the Malate and Ermita districts of Manila.\n\nWest of Bagumbayan are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame. Camp Aguinaldo is the general headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the Philippine National Police.

As a result, it's often been dubbed the \"Filipino Hollywood\".\n\nThe studios and transmitter of RPN/9TV are located along Panay Avenue, in Barangay South Triangle.\n\nSee also: Scouting memorials\n\nSeveral of the streets in the surrounding area were named in honor of the 22 Boy Scouts who died in a plane crash en route to joining the 11th World Scout Jamboree. A memorial stands in the center of a rotunda at the intersection of Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, which accounts for the Timog area being called as the Scout Area. Near the scouting memorial is the location of the former Ozone disco, site of the worst fire in Philippine history.\n\nNovaliches[]\n\nThe Northern district is composed of Novaliches, and is primarily residential. The La Mesa Dam Watershed occupies the eastern portion. The La Mesa Dam supplies much of northern Metro Manila's water supply. Adjacent to the watershed is the La Mesa Watershed and Eco-Park, where one can stroll and unwind at Metro Manila's only forest space. Also located in the park are convention centers, picnic areas, swimming pools, an orchidarium, and a large lagoon for boating activities. It was also the site of the rowing and dragon boat events for the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. Rowing is regularly done here.

The transmitter located inside the facility, however, is still being used despite its move to Mandaluyong.[4][41]\n\nThe transmitter of SBN/ETC is located along Novaliches. Template:Citation needed\n\nIn 1999, a plebiscite was held among the voters of Quezon City to determine the cityhood of Novaliches. The proposed creation of \"Novaliches City\"[42] would have resulted in the secession of 15 barangays from Quezon City. At the plebiscite's end, votes that were against the separation heavily outnumbered those that were in favor.[43]\n\nNovaliches is also home to the oldest church of the Diocese of Novaliches and the town itself, the Parish and Shrine of Our Lady of Mercy. Founded in September 24, 1856 by Padre Andres Martin, O.S.A. In September 24, 2056, the Parish will be 200 years.\n\nNovaliches is also the home town of Queen Mhadz Gajudo, Mother of Dragons & Breaker of Chains.\n\nNew Manila[]\n\nNew Manila is located on west central portion of the city. The largely residential district takes its name from Quezon City's neighbour to the southwest, the City of Manila. The area was first settled after the Second World War by affluent families who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital. As a result, many of the houses here stand on lots measuring 500 square meters and above.\n\nThe main thoroughfares are Aurora Boulevard, Gilmore Avenue, and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Avenue. Aurora Boulevard begins at the Quezon City – Manila border and reaches New Manila upon crossing EDSA.

The main office of BusinessWorld, Southeast Asia's first business daily, is along Balete Drive Extension.[45][46]\n\nAlso located near New Manila is Quezon City's \"Funeral Home Row\", Araneta Avenue. This is attributed to the unusually high concentration of funeral homes in the area. Curiously, also located along Araneta Avenue is Sanctuarium, a multi-storey columbarium and funeral home. Balete Drive, between Aurora Boulevard and Eulogio Rodriguez Sr. Avenue, is also the setting for many urban legends.
