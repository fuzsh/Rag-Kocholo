        "text": "This should not surprise me, researching a woman from the 18th Century and discovering a strong parallel to a woman fighting the same battle today. The more I looked into this story, the more painful it became. But in the end, I found hope.\n\nThis is one of my longer feature articles and I ask your patience as I wend my way through the story to reach \"pag-ibig at pag-asa,\" Filipino for love and hope.\n\nGabriela Silang, a young Filipina who lived in the northwestern seaboard of Luzon in the mid-1700s is most commonly portrayed wielding a bolo knife.\n\nThere's little doubt Gabriela Salang was a fearless revolutionary against Spanish colonial rule, and her spirit continues to run in the blood of women today, who carry on the struggle for self-determination in the face of centuries of imperialism in the Philippines.\n\nMonument of Gabriela Silang located in Manila's Ayala Triangle Gardens created by Jose M. Mendoza in 1971\n\nThat includes playwright and peasant organizer Amanda Echanis, arrested 13-months ago and imprisoned with her newborn baby, two of more than 600 political prisoners under the Rodrigo Duterte regime. ​​\n\nBelow, Linda Echanis demonstrates for the release of her daughter and grandson. Courtesy Pinoy Weekly\n\nFerdinand Magellan, you may have learned in school led the first crew to circumnavigate the globe in 1522. What may not have stuck in your mind, is that he failed to actually make it around the earth with his shipmates, because he was killed by indigenous people in what we now call the Philippines.\n\nOur heroine Gabriela Silang was the first woman who raised an army against the Spanish, and she led the longest-lasting revolt in 1763. Like a later Filipina leader, Corazon Aquino, she picked up the fight for freedom after her husband was killed for his resistance.\n\nIndigenous people resisted Spanish colonization for the next three centuries, rising in at least 300 significant armed revolts. Not only did they fight to reclaim their land, but to overthrow the invaders who forced them into virtual slavery building their churches and government buildings, and the universally unbearable yoke of excessive taxes.\n\nGabriela Silang was honored on a Philippine postage stamp in 1974, interestingly enough, under the administration of dictator Ferdinand Marcos. It's a rare depiction of her without her bolo knife. Read on for the story of her knife-wielding days!\n\nGabriela was initially forced into marriage with a much older, wealthy businessman, but after his death three years later, she married a young rebel, Diego Salang.\n\n​\n\nWhen British forces occupied Manila in retaliation for the Spanish-French alliance in the Seven Year's War in 1762, Diego seized the opportunity. Martialing fellow revolutionaries in the Ilocano region on the northwestern coast of Luzon. His forces took control of the City of Vigan, planning to create an independent Ilocano nation.\n\nThe revolution was cut short when British-promised military aid failed to show, and a friend turned traitor assassinated Deigo Salang in his home. Gabriela fled for her life, setting up camp in the Abra Mountains to pull the resistance together.\n\nAfter four months of guerilla attacks, she led her army on mission to recapture Vigan.\n\n​General Gabriela Salang's insurgent army assaulted a much larger Spanish force at Vigan. They were defeated and captured.\n\nThe Spanish executed as many as one hundred rebels, in public hangings along the coast as a warning to Ilocanos. Lastly, in September 1763, Gabriela was hanged in the public square in Vigan.\n\nNumerous memorials in the Philippines portray her on a galloping horse brandishing a machete type blade used for centuries to cut through the tropical jungle.\n\nHer brave legacy is also celebrated in performance art. One such event put on by\n\n4Ever40 Sisterhood raised money to aid people in remote areas of the Philippines to become self-sufficient.\n\nMarilou Tito played the role of Gabriela Silang, 2015.\n\nThe people of the Philippines eventually defeated Spanish colonialism in 1898, only to begin a new anti-colonial struggle against the United States.\n\nThis month an international human rights monitor denounced the Rodrigo Duterte Administration's harassment of journalists and extrajudicial killings of activists, including labor and peasant organizers and environmentalists.\n\nToday, 652 political prisoners are in custody in the Philippines, according toPilgrims for Peace. More than 400 were arrested under the Duterte administration. Human Rights Watch stated, “The past six years of the Duterte administration have been an unmitigated disaster for human rights.\"\n\nBelow: protesters march outside Malacanang palace in Manila, Philippines, June 30, 2021.

Authorities arrested the playwright and peasant organizer December 2, 2020, shortly after she'd given birth. They allege she possessed a M16 assault rifle, two hand grenades and assorted ammunition.\n\nAmanda denies the charges and her lawyer says the arrest was illegal and baseless.\n\nMany of the hundreds of political prisoners in custody face similar charges, which they also deny.\n\nWhat sets Amanda apart, aside from her toddler being in prisoner with her, is that she herself was incarcerated as a two-year-old when her mother was arrested in 1990.\n\nBelow Amanda's mother, Erlinda Echanis is shown Christmas Eve, waiting and hoping for a video call from her daughter and grandson from the Cagayan Provincial Jail, Luzon.
