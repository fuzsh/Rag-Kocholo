        "text": "“Be careful what you wish for.”\n\nInto the Woods is one of the breathtaking musicals that both children and adults can enjoy for so many reasons. Disney is behind the film adaptation of this magnificent musical, splitting of fairy-tale myths, which could be quite uninviting when done onstage. It really overturns the traditional idea that “once upon a time” always leads to a “bright happy ever after.” Although its first hour is more striking than its second, this movie-musical never spoils a fictional wholesomeness. There has been much thought about the second half and whether certain scenes might not fit in to a PG rating would make the cut.\n\nWhat makes Into the Woods so entertaining is the cleverness and creativity of the tale itself and the way certain characters match the talents of its storytellers. I have never been so thirsty for movie musical refreshment. The mashed up stories, the setting and their voices made the movie unforgettably unique. Although the last hour was quite unnecessary, it still made an impact to the viewers. For me, It would have been better if they ended the movie when Cinderella and the Prince got married.\n\nThe Lilian Velez: Till Death Do Us Part\n\n“DADDY, NARDING KILLED MOMMY!”\n\nCarlo J. Caparas (1995)\n\nThis is based on a true-to-life story of Lilian Velez. A famous stage and movie actress during the 40’s who was brutally murdered by her former obsessed leading man/ co-actor Bernardo “Narding” Anzures on June 26, 1948. Lilian Velez was 24 years old while Narding Anzures was 21. The crime took place in the Velez’ house at around two in the morning. Authorities said that Narding Anzures admitted plunging the knife into Lilian Velez while they sat in her home.\n\nThe actress’ four-year-old daughter, Vivian saw how her mother was brutally killed by Narding as she peeked through a small hole in her room. The real reason for the murder was unclear although it has been said that Narding was very much obsessed with Lilian Velez even if she’s already married with Jose Climaco, a movie director. Climaco came home at around three in the morning and was shocked to see policemen in their house. His daughter then came running and said “Daddy, Narding killed mommy!” which made him run inside the house.\n\nI am very much impressed on how Cesar Montano portrayed the role of Bernardo “Narding” Anzures. He did really well on the whole movie. Also Sharon Cuneta who portrayed as Lilian Velez and Joel Torre as Jose Climaco. Cesar Montano’s acting was really good. I can see pass through his eyes all the anger, the love, the obsession all wrapped in one great character. It felt like I was taken back to the 40’s while I was watching the entire film. The whole scene, the set up, the wardrobe and even the texture of the film really made it look like it was taken during the 40’s. Also the sounds and how the film was taken. I hope that these kinds of film were taken good care of so that the younger generations could look back on how the movies started and was created back then.\n\nMy 2046 is someone I have known for years now. We may not be together anymore but all the memories and plans are still here. Francis and I could do the simplest things together, watch a good film, share a bucket of popcorn, snug in each others arms, talk for hours and end up laughing about random things in life and even then, I knew that I was really fortunate. The first person who was constantly trying to impress me, annoy me and make me feel loved every single day. Francis accepted who she was but more than that, she accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered, not even our family or anyone else in the world. It was just us. She wasn’t just someone I loved back then. She was my best friend, my alter ego and I never imagined giving things up between us… But after she left, nothing was never the same.\n\nI wanted to believe that endless love was possible back when I was younger. But just like life, love was quite confusing. And our regrets led in to the most beautiful yet tragic kinds of what if’s that could never be answered… I always wanted to travel the world with Francis and just make wonderful memories with her. Memories which we can always look back when we grow old. Memories which will still give us that teenage kind of love, those butterflies-in-my-stomach-every-time-I-see-you kind of feeling. Memories which will remain in us for a very long time. I don’t know that I’ve ever felt as happy as I did when I was with her, it was always like that when we were together. It seems like I never wanted it to end… But eventually it did. If we pretend none of this ever happened, then I’m not sure we’ll ever get another chance. I am afraid, I know she is too. We’re still young. We still have time to make things right. We still have the rest of our lives.\n\nI know Francis loved me and that she would do anything for me. And that was one of the reasons why it still hurts – when we decided to end what we have. Because I knew even then how extraordinary and unconditional that kind of love was. Only few, and the luckiest people get the chance to experience it all. And I am still thankful I had the chance to experience it.\n\n“All memories are there in the future, we are told, but no one has ever returned.”\n\nThe film 2046 is about happy, sad, tragic, love-story combined. In the movie, 2046 is the name of the novel being written by Chow. An express train to the year 2046 which contains all the memories. People who choose to ride the express train never had the chance to go back except one, the narrator. It is also a room in a hotel just across Chow’s room which has been a place where series of his loved women lived. Chow also met Zhang, a woman who became his alter ego. They would always prefer to drink and smoke and drown their sorrows and end up having sex. All of these relationships were seen in detailed and composed shots that seem to be remembering the characters.\n\nWhy this story was written, and how the future world of 2046 shares a function with the present Room 2046, is still an inviting mystery to everyone who has come to watch the film. It has left me wondering whether we define the future as a place in our minds where things can be delayed or things may happen sooner or later?\n\nAs for how the film was shot, I must say that every scene was carefully planned. It was visually stunning. The film was full of colors and was jammed with different kinds of furnitures which made the scenes really authentic. There was something in the shots which impressed emotions and gave mood to the scenes."
