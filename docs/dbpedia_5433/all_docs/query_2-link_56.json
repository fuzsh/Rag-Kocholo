        "text": "The death of award-winning actress Jaclyn Jose was a tremendous loss not just to many celebrities, but also to the entertainment industry as a whole. Jose’s passing left a huge mark such that it was the top entertainment story on the first week of March.\n\nJose died at the age of 60 on March 2, although her death was confirmed by her daughter Andi Eigenmann in a press conference, where she was very emotional throughout.\n\nRicardo Cepeda’s twin Robert Go also appealed for help in raising funds for bail, after the former was arrested in October 2023 for syndicated estafa and violations of the Bouncing Check Law and the Securities and Regulation Code.\n\n“Tahanang Pinakamasaya,” on the other hand, was removed from the airwaves after nine months, with GMA Network Inc. and production company Television and Production Exponents (TAPE) Inc. citing “unwanted circumstances.”\n\nAllow us to look back on INQUIRER.net’s biggest entertainment news from March 1 to 7.\n\nJaclyn Jose, 60\n\nJaclyn Jose, whose real name is Mary Jane Guck, died of heart attack on March 2, at age 60.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her management PPL Entertainment Inc. in an official statement a day later, with her family requesting the public to pray for her “eternal repose.”\n\n“It saddens us to inform everyone of the untimely passing of Miss Jaclyn Jose… The Guck and Eigenmann families are requesting for everyone to please pray for the eternal repose of Miss Jaclyn Jose and for them to be allowed the respect and privacy to mourn her passing, and navigate these difficult times,” the statement read.\n\nJose was survived by her two children, daughter Andi Eigenmann, and son, Gwen Garimond.\n\nThe veteran actress, whose last appearance was as Jail BGEN Dolores Espinas in the TV series, “FPJ’s Batang Quiapo,” was the first ever Filipino actor to win the Best Actress award at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival for her role in Brillante Mendoza’s “Ma’ Rosa.”\n\nIn the critically acclaimed film, she portrayed a mother who runs a small convenience store and gets entangled in the world of drug dealing to make ends meet.\n\nShe was also last seen in the 2023 Metro Manila Film Festival film entry “Broken Heart’s Trip.”\n\nAside from the prestigious Cannes award, Jose was also a recipient of five Gawad Urians, two Luna Awards, a FAMAS Award, and an MMFF award, and was under the tutelage of great directors such as Lino Brocka and Chito Roño.\n\nNo foul play in Jaclyn Jose’s death\n\nJaclyn Jose’s family didn’t see any signs of foul play in the death of the award-winning actress, according to the Philippine National Police (PNP).\n\n“The family is asking for privacy, and they believe that there is no foul play in her death. We are sympathizing with her family and friends,” PNP spokesperson Col. Jean Fajardo said in a mix of English and Filipino during a press briefing.\n\nThe death of Jose was confirmed by PPL Entertainment after her body was discovered inside her home in Quezon City.\n\nCelebrities’ tributes poured in for Jaclyn Jose, with most of her co-stars praising her professionalism and kindheartedness. On social media, many noted her as a “true icon” in the Philippine entertainment industry.\n\nDeath by heart attack\n\nAndi Eigenmann, who was accompanied by her paternal half-brother Gabby, was emotional as she confirmed the death of Jaclyn Jose, due to myocardial infarction, or heart attack.\n\nEigenmann then requested the public to refrain from speculating about Jose’s death and to give their family space to be able to grieve the sudden death of the beloved screen icon.\n\n“As our family is trying to come to terms with this unfortunate incident, please provide us the respect and privacy to grieve. We hope this will put speculations to rest,” she said.\n\nOvercome with tears, the former actress who is now a businesswoman based in Siargao, said her mother’s legacy will live on through her work and the lives she touched.\n\n“I just like to say that her undeniable legacy will forever live on through her work, through her children, grandchildren, and the many lives she touched. As she herself, her life itself, was her greatest obra maestra (masterpiece),” she said. Eigenmann then immediately left the media room with her brother and other companions.\n\nRicardo Cepeda’s brother appeals for help\n\nRobert Go, twin brother of currently detained actor Ricardo Cepeda, set up a fundraising effort for the latter as he admitted that the financial burden of his legal battle has already been “overwhelming.”\n\nA GoFundMe account was made for Ricardo, who’s currently detained after being arrested back in October 2023 on charges of syndicated estafa and violations of the Bouncing Check Law and the Securities and Regulation Code.\n\nIn an update on Feb. 29, Robert once again appealed to their “compassionate supporters” as he disclosed that the actor’s hearing for bail was delayed until April.\n\n“We come to you today with a heavy heart, bearing the latest update on Richard’s ongoing legal battle. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, and Richard needs your support now more than ever,” he said, referring to the actor by his real name.\n\n“With 23 hearings scheduled between February and June 2024, the financial burden is overwhelming. Each court appearance costs at least $500.00 (over P28,000), in addition to mounting attorney’s fees,” he continued.\n\nRobert further lamented the “sluggishness” of the legal process in the country, but he emphasized that the public’s support, generosity and encouragement have been a “lifeline” for Ricardo and his family.\n\n“[Richard] believes there is a purpose in his plight, an opportunity to shed light on the injustices faced by innocent individuals like himself. Richard understands that his fight is not just for himself but for others who may find themselves in a similar predicament,” Robert wrote.\n\nThe fundraising account has already raised $6,813, or over P380,000, as of press time.\n\n‘Tahanang Pinakamasaya’ goes off the air\n\nThe noontime variety show “Tahanang Pinakamasaya,” which replaced “Eat Bulaga!” last year on GMA Network Inc., has gone off the air after just nine months.\n\nThe news was confirmed on March 4 by veteran talk show host Boy Abunda on “Fast Talk With Boy Abunda,” which also airs on the same TV network. “The noontime show ‘Home of the Happiest’ has bid farewell to its viewers.”\n\nTAPE Inc., the show’s producer that has a block-time agreement with GMA Network until the end of the year, has yet to issue an official statement. The show replaced Eat Bulaga in June 2023 but changed its name to “Tahanang Pinakamasaya” after losing a court dispute over trademark issues.\n\nThe variety show’s official Facebook and YouTube pages have become inaccessible to the public. However, clips of the final episode on March 2 have been re-shared by various social media pages and YouTube channels.\n\nIn the said episode, the hosts led by Paolo Contis and actor-politician Isko Moreno bid the audience goodbye.\n\n“Whatever you do and whatever problems you may face, do everything for love. That’s how we love you, Kapuso. Every day, Paolo, the TP family and TAPE Inc. strive to bring the ‘Tahanang Pinakamasaya’ to every Filipino family. Thank you also to our advertisers, supporters, and Kapuso,” said Moreno.\n\nContis said, “Thank you very much. This is a grand Saturday. Another Saturday we won’t forget, and all of this is dedicated to you from TAPE Inc.—the provider of joy and unlimited surprises since 1979 through ‘Eat Bulaga,’ up to now here at ‘Tahanang Pinakamasaya.’”\n\nThe other co-hosts were Alexa Miro, Arra San Agustin, Betong Sumaya, Buboy Villar, Cassy Legaspi, Dasuri Choi, Glaiza de Castro, Kimpoy Feliciano, Kokoy de Santos, Michael Sager, Winwyn Marquez and Yasser Marta.\n\nTAPE Inc. also faced legal disputes over the trademark and usage of “Eat Bulaga”—the show that “Tahanang Pinakamasaya” replaced, but it ultimately lost the case. In January, TAPE Inc. sought a temporary restraining order against the court order on the trademark.\n\n‘Unwanted circumstances’\n\nTAPE Inc. officially aired the final episode of “Tahanang Pinakamasaya,” saying they decided to “call off” the noontime show amid the production company’s “unwanted circumstances.”\n\n“It is with a heavy heart that we inform our televiewers that our noontime show ‘Tahanang Pinakamasaya’ on Kapuso network, GMA 7, will no longer be on air effective March 8, 2024,” read TAPE’s announcement, which was shared via GMA on March 7.\n\n“TAPE Inc. extends its profound gratitude to its home network, GMA 7, for a long and fruitful partnership. GMA 7’s kind consideration and understanding of the company’s unwanted circumstances have been instrumental in helping the company in this transition,” it continued. “Despite our best efforts to save the show, both parties have reached a mutual agreement to finally call off the show.”\n\nThe production company also addressed its supporters, TV hosts, advertisers, and employees who had been with them since “Eat Bulaga,” and extended their “sincerest ‘Thank you!’ and optimistic ‘See you again!’”\n\nGMA released a statement as well on Instagram, thanking TAPE for their decades-long partnership.\n\n“Due to unavoidable circumstances, TAPE has made the difficult decision to cease the airing of ‘Tahanang Pinakamasaya,’” it said.\n\n“GMA Network would like to thank TAPE for its invaluable contribution to noontime programming for the past decades, which Filipinos will surely remember for many years to come,” it added.\n\n“Tahanang Pinakamasaya” aired its last live episode on March 3, and broadcast replay episodes until its last day on March 7.\n\n“Lunchtime Movie Hits” had since taken over the now-defunct noontime show’s timeslot."
