        "text": "A hidden paradise. That is how locals see the rural town of San Narciso in Quezon Province. Around 6-7 hours of bus ride from Manila, the unspoiled natural beauty of the town is a haven for those seeking solitude, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nSan Narciso is a first class municipality with a population of 45, 386 people (2010). With an area of about 263 km2, the town is subdivided into 24 barangays. Because of the town’s distance from the bigger cities, there aren’t too many tourists, usually. I personally chose to stay in San Narciso for a week during my visit to the Philippines a few months ago. I did stay in Manila for 3 days to take the IELTS, but the highlight of my vacation was in the countryside, particularly the awesome escapade to the Bagong Tuklas cave resort.\n\nHere are some shots for you to get to know the town:\n\nWell, the town is not only all about beaches, water bodies, rocky sea coasts.. It also boasts vast coconut (and other crops like rice, bananas, corn, yam) plantations!\n\nYou haven’t really stayed in the Philippine countryside if you haven’t had your fingernails dirty!\n\nI so love the countryside! Business was booming for my aunt and uncle who hosted me. One of their businesses, of course, has something to do with copra (coconut), charcoal and nuts.\n\nI am quite impressed by the town proper. It became modernized, yet, the products being sold in the kiosks remain fresh, natural and organic.\n\nSt. Joseph the Worker is the patron saint of the town. I’m quite curious why St. Joseph and not St. Narcissus. 😛\n\nOne week was not really enough to fully experience life in the province of Quezon. Lucky for me, I spent my first 5 years there, but in a more rural town called Guinayangan. It’s strange, but my childhood there is one of the best memories of my life so far.\n\nThe photos basically sum up my trip to the countryside. I can (still) smell the earth, the fresh coco juice, the sea, the entire place just by staring at them. 😉 Looking forward to visiting sunny Philippines again in the near future! Mabuhay!\n\nSee you on my next trip! ❤"
