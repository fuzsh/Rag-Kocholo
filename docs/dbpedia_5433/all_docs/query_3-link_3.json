        "text": "Here are some suggestions to get you started when planning your Quezon City itinerary.\n\n1. Enjoy a Day at Quezon Memorial Circle\n\nQuezon City Memorial Circle is a national park located in the heart of the metro. It’s one of the best locations to visit if you want to learn more about the city, thanks to the attractions found there:\n\nMuseo ni Manuel Quezon\n\nThe towering structure in the center of Quezon City Circle shrouds the museum dedicated to the president from whom the city is named after.\n\nMuseo ni Manuel L. Quezon features artifacts commemorating the Commonwealth President’s life—from his humble beginnings in Baler to his time as president during the Japanese occupation.\n\nThere is also a section devoted to his wife Doña Aurora, and the tour ends with a visit to the president’s coffin.\n\nThe Museo was built in 1979 but underwent modernization in 2015 to include interactive elements.\n\nQuezon Heritage House\n\nOriginally located in Gilmore Street, New Manila, the Quezon City government worked to reconstruct the original Quezon family house in 2013.\n\nToday, about 60% of the original structure and interiors, along with the furniture and memorabilia, stands in the Quezon City Memorial Circle, open for everyone to visit.\n\nThe bright yellow, two-story house of neoclassical revival design is also where the Philippine Red Cross was founded, with help from Doña Aurora. Admission is free, but donations are welcome.\n\nQuezon City Experience (QCX)\n\nQuezon City Experience or QCX opened in 2015. This interactive socio-cultural museum highlights the city’s rich history, from its beginnings as a hill where President Quezon’s vision of a great, green, and growing future came to life.\n\nIts 16 interactive galleries allow visitors to learn about and experience moments in the city’s history. It’s also a great opportunity to take selfies on a cool and informative backdrop.\n\nInside the museum are commercial establishments, a 100-seat theater, a 60-seat lecture room, conference rooms, and a rooftop garden for events and exhibits.\n\n2. Explore Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center\n\nThis 22.7-hectare land in the middle of Quezon City is a sanctuary for animals, plants, and people alike.\n\nIts vast area is the ideal place to do your morning jog, and the trees make the perfect shade for when you’re beat and need to refresh. Meanwhile, the botanical gardens boast an impressive range of indigenous and plant species.\n\nApart from these, the Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center serves as a repository and rehabilitation center for sick, injured, confiscated, donated, and abandoned animals.\n\nThe simulated natural habitat allows them to recover to full health. Look out for the more exotic species like Philippine deer, water monitor lizards, and Palawan bearded pigs.\n\n3. Show Your Creativity at Art In Island\n\nPhoto from Art In Island\n\nSee things from a different perspective at Art In Island, the largest 3D art museum in Asia.
