        "text": "Art in Island is really a treat for people of all ages, especially for the young ones and young at heart who are willing to get immersed in their imagination. It is known as the largest and first selfie museum in the world, and the largest 3D Art Museum in Asia, which offers so many things to see and do, filled with 3D art, illusions and a lot of fun! Since I heard a lot of good things about it, I brought my family and my son, who really loves art, there.\n\nThe art museum is located in Cubao, Quezon City. It is huge, tidy and fully air-conditioned. It was founded by Yun Jae Kyoung together with 18 other Korean painters, who created the paintings in the museum. I have learned that it contains about 200 masterpieces, which give you the illusion of depth especially when you view them from a certain angle. They were designed to serve as a background when taking pictures. In addition, the museum provides a great bonding opportunity for groups of friends or entire families.\n\nWhile exploring the museum, I was fascinated to see everyone, especially my son, being excited and delighted to show off their poses and bring out the creativity within them. Most importantly, I realized that art paintings are not complete if you are not with them and if you do not take pictures of your crazy or wacky poses with the art.\n\nMy family and I were blown away by the different optical illusion set-ups that would trick your perceptions and help you create unbelievable photos. Also, we enjoyed the so many different themed zones such as:\n\nMasterpiece Zone – Famous paintings from all over the world such “The Starry Night” by Vincent van Gogh, “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo da Vinci, and many more\n\nUnderwater Zone – Aquatic adventures\n\nAnimal Zone – Journey to the Jungle\n\nWinter Wonderland – Christmas Zone\n\nReligious Zone – Religious World Art\n\nCenter Hall – Dungeons of the Ancient Times\n\nFantasy Zone – Magical and Mysterious Walls\n\nTo me, Art in Island is certainly one of my favorite places here in Manila, as it allows me to become more creative and imaginative by posing at a specific vantage points, making it looks like I am part of the scene. Indeed, it was an afternoon well spent with my family and the experience was definitely worth it.\n\nLittle Lilly travel tip:\n\nThe best time to visit is during week days for there is a lesser crowd when compared to weekends. The visit takes about 2-3 hours.\n\nWear comfortable socks because shoes are not allowed inside the galleries to preserve the paintings as some paintings can be found in the floor and to maintain the cleanliness.\n\nWear appropriate and comfortable clothes because you are going to jump, bend, roll around on the floor, do splits and basically move.\n\nBring a camera, but use of flash and tripods are not allowed. Take as many pictures as you can.\n\nCheck the sample poses on the wall to help you know the photo points on the floor and help you figure out where to take the shot.\n\nWait for your turn and do not intrude when there are people posing and taking pictures at a certain art.\n\nFeel free to ask help from the staff, who is scattered in almost all areas. They are friendly and helpful when it comes to taking your pictures. They can also suggest you how to pose or where to stand when taking a photo.\n\nBe amazed by the 3D paintings. Be creative and playful when posing with the art. Go crazy and be part of it. You’ll definitely have a great time there!\n\nHave you been to Art in Island? What do you best like there?"
