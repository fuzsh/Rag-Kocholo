        "text": "Quezon City is a large sprawling city which had her own share of spooky places, haunted buildings, heritage trees, creepy tales tucked in her colorful history.\n\nWe came up with at least 35 places within the city that people had experienced or find some paranormal activities or haunted stories. We decided to narrow down the list to 20.\n\n20 Spooky Places within Quezon City\n\nSacred Heart Novitiate -Novaliches (photo courtesy of Ms. Jo Quimpo)\n\n20.) Sacred Heart Novitiate. Retreat House and Seminary 1118 Quirino Highway, Novaliches – Sacred Heart Novitiate was erected in 1932 as a chosen site for seminarian and priest who wanted to have a peaceful retreat under the cool weather and simpler lifestyle away from hustle and bustle of the city life.\n\nIn the 1930’s, Novaliches is primary an agricultural town with few people living beyond the northern part of Bayan ( town proper).\n\nJesuit retrieval team from the Sacred Heart Novitiate in Novaliches, Quezon City, spent two separate days in December 1945 gathering all the remains from the niches, for transfer to the Jesuit Cemetery at the Novitiate.\n\nThe haunted stories in this seminary started way back in the 1960’s, when some people reported seeing some headless priests, nuns and even people dressed in Katipunero within the cemetery compound in unexpected manner.\n\nSome people would recall that they would refer the place as ‘ masukal‘ densely covered with trees or vegetation even in the late the 1970’s. Some residents would recount that there might be unseen spirits who might have been disturbed when Quirino Highway was widened. Another expert recount that some of the long dead priest wanted some prayers.\n\n19.) Saint Paul University of Quezon City – In some portion of the comfort rooms inside the university. They say that a girl who committed suicide is known to show herself to students. An alumni would also recount a Japanese soldier who lurks within the old building of the university.\n\nAnother alumni recounted that she would get lost within some parts of the buildings during her stay in the campus.\n\n18.) Poveda College -The school had a black garden behind the chapel in which a former student who hanged herself spirit. Another story is of an old friar who is spotted in one of his favorite classrooms during early morning.\n\n17.) Flos Carmeli Institution – The school was conceived in 1972 the Catholic school—the name of which literally means “Flower of Carmel” within Fairview, Quezon City. It is located 12 Carmel Street, Fairview Park.\n\nThe owners of Fairview subdivision Mr. and Mrs. Bonifacio Regalado offered a land to be manage by the first superior of the Sister of Mount Carmel in the Philippines. The school got their first graduates in 1975 and had a large sprawling campus of about 1.4 hectares.\n\nThe school closed down in 2012 due to dwindling number of enrollment and bankruptcy. Eerie sound of children reciting were still being heard by some residents who lives near the abandoned school.\n\n16.) Camp Crame– One of the spookiest place within the camp is the main building. Some former military personnel would be spotted marching around the campus, while Japanese sentry guards are sometimes spotted even in noontime.\n\nSaint Joseph College\n\n15.) Saint Joseph College – One of the oldest building and structure constructed along E. Rodriguez Sr. avenue. Students, employees and security guards would cite some stories. Among the most popular is the headless nun, Japanese sentry guard which guards the old building and American gentleman are spotted jogging.\n\n14.) Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center– The villas and small quonset huts were popular to photographers,film crews shooting at the lush man made lagoon and big trees within the sanctuary. There were reports of sightings of ethereal beings which dwells in some decades- old balete trees and villas located within the sanctuary. There were also reports of orbs spotted by a couple of well-known photographer.\n\nNCBA compound along Aurora Boulevard\n\n13.) NCBA compound – some of the students, employees and security guards would swear that sounds and creaking voices at the upper portion of building.\n\ntamarind tree\n\n12.) Tamarid Tree in Narra street, Barangay Amihan, Project 3, Quezon City- The tamarind tree is considered heritage tree of the district.\n\nheritage tree marker\n\nThe tree is said to be home of several enkanto, tikbalangs and ethereal beings.\n\nnarra street\n\nThere were several attempts to cut the tree in the past,Those who would try to attempt would risk getting sick or died in a mysterious way.\n\ntamarind tree which grows along narra street and molave street\n\nThere are two tamarind trees located within Narra street. Another tamarind tree also had reported some sighting.\n\nAccording to one jeepney driver which ply the Project 2 and 3 route, recounted that as long as people would respect the tree like saying “tabi-tabi po” or excuse me when passing underneath its trunk.
