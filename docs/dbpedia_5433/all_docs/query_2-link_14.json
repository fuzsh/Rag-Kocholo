        "text": "Duane Allman was born in Nashville, Tennessee in November 1946. On Christmas Day in 1960, Duane was given a motorcycle as a gift while his younger brother, Gregg Allman, got a guitar. A few months later, Duane wrecked his motorcycle in an accident, but traded in the spare parts for a guitar of his own. Within a year, the duo played at sock hops in Daytona Beach, Florida, calling themselves \"The Kings\". In 1965, Duane and Gregg formed their band, \"The Allman Joys\", and toured the south, but they failed to make an impression in the music business. Duane, Gregg and a few friends drifted to Los Angeles where they formed a new band called \"Hourglass\". After recording two albums for Liberty Records, the Allmans returned to Florida where they played with the bands \"Second Coming\" and \"The 31th of February\". Duane frequently traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama and played backup guitar with such great singers as Aretha Franklin, King Curtis and Percy Sledge. In 1969, Duane got his first big break when Jerry Wexler, the vice-president of Atlantic Records, offered him a solo contract. Duane formed a new band which made up of drummers Jai Johanny Johanson and Butch Trucks, guitarist Dickey Betts, bassist Berry Oakley, and brother Gregg Allman on the keyboard. Once assembled, The Allman Brothers Band settled in Macon, Georgia where they joined Phil Walden's Capricorn Records for a recording contract. The band's first album combined strains of blues, soul, rock and country music into the electrifying sound that launched Southern rock music. Their second album, \"Idlewild South\", climbed to the top of the charts where they performed at New York's Filimore East in March 1971. The band recorded a double album released in July of that year and reached the top ten, but Duane did not live to see his band's true success. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman was riding his motorcycle down Macon's main street when a truck pulled out from another street in front of him. He lost control of his bike trying to avoid a collision and crashed head-on into the rig, killing him almost immediately. He was 24 years old. The band played at his funeral. Only a year later, they gathered somberly, again, to bury Berry Oakley, who was killed in a motorcycle crash, just three blocks away from Duane's fatal accident.\n\nJill Banner's early life was somewhat nomadic. Her father died when she was 2, and her mother moved from Washington to South Dakota and Iowa before settling in Glendale, California. Jill attended the Hollywood Professional School (one of her classmates was Peggy Lipton). Her debut film, Spider Baby (1967), was shot in 1964 but not released until 1968. When the film finally came out she received rave reviews for her performance as one of a pair of crazed sisters in this dark tale of cannibalism and incest. Between the shooting of the film and its release, Banner did a few films and much TV work. She was regularly used by producer/director Jack Webb in his police shows Polizeibericht (1967) and Adam-12 (1968), often playing a blissed-out hippie. In the 1970s she soured on the Hollywood life and moved to New Mexico, where she sold real estate. After a few years, though, she returned to California to try to resume her career. On August 7, 1982, she was driving on the Ventura Freeway, between the Tujunga and Laurel Canyon Blvd. off-ramps, when her car was hit by a truck whose driver was drunk. Not wearing a seat belt, she was ejected from the car and hit her head on the center divider. She went into a coma, and died at a local hospital, never having come out of it. At the time of her death she was employed by Marlon Brando and was developing scripts for him.\n\nChris Bell was born January 12, 1951 in Memphis, Tennessee. He was always a talented artist but began displaying his ability as a writer and guitarist at about 12 years old. After high school Bell became a founding member of possibly the greatest post-Beatles-style rock band that the USA has yet produced. The band was called Big Star and they released 3 classic records \"#1 Record\" (1971), which he wrote and performed on and the others, \"Radio City\" (1972) and \"Third\" (first officially released in England in 1978) which he reportedly helped arrange and write. The first record was a critical success and today, in the CD format, it has sold in the millions, but at that time their record label, Ardent/Stax, a primarily black R&B and Soul Music label, was either unwilling or unable to adequately promote, publicize and market this Beatles-sounding masterpiece. It is reported by his brother in the liner notes of his posthumously released solo album, \"I Am The Cosmos\" (1992), that he was so despondent over the failure that he attempted to \"do himself in\". His brother helped him see the light and between the years 1974-1978 Chris began to record his own record. This work can be heard today on that disk and also in the numerous cover versions of these songs done by popular artists of the 90s and today. He had not yet finished it when, in the words of his brother David, \"returning home from a rehearsal with his new band, his car struck a telephone pole on Poplar Ave., and he died instantly.\" Chris' most popular contribution to modern culture is still his song \"In The Street\" co-written with Big Star band mate Alex Chilton. This song is used as the opening theme for _\"That 70s Show\" (1998)_ and is performed by legendary 70s rock band \"Cheap Trick\".\n\nBell's scant body of work is selling more every year to new young audiences, and being sited as influence for more and more contemporary musicians. His brother David has remarked that Chris would be thrilled if he had lived to see his ideas and music vindicated.\n\nIn the US from the age of 10, he first worked as a journalist-illustrator for the New York World. Interviewing Thomas A. Edison, he so impressed the inventor with his drawings that Edison suggested he allow some of them to be photographed by the Kinetograph camera. The result was a short film, Edison Drawn by 'World' Artist (1896). Fascinated by the new medium, Blackton bought a Kinetoscope from Edison, went into partnership with a friend, Albert E. Smith, and exhibited films with it. In 1897 they added a third partner, William T. Rock, and the young partners converted the projector into a motion-picture camera and established the Vitagraph Company. They started film production in an open-air studio on the roof of the Morse Building at 140 Nassau Street, New York City. Their first film, The Burglar on the Roof (1898), was about 50 feet long, with Blackton playing the leading role. In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, they produced Tearing Down the Spanish Flag (1898), probably the world's first propaganda film. Smith operated the camera and Blackton was again the actor, tearing down the Spanish flag and raising the Stars and Stripes to the top of a flagpole. Blackton and his partners continued filming fake and real news events, ranging from Spanish-American War footage to coverage of local fires and crimes in New York City. They constantly expanded their activities and soon moved into the world's first glass-enclosed studios, in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Blackton directed most of the production of this early period, including such story films as A Gentleman of France (1905) and Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman (1905), two milestones in the development of the American feature film. Blackton pioneered the single-frame (one turn, one picture) technique in cinema animation, turning out a number of animated cartoons between 1906 and 1910, including the immensely successful Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906), Das Spukhotel (1907), and The Magic Fountain Pen (1909). He also introduced (in 1908, before Griffith) the close shot, a camera position between the close-up and the medium shot. Like Griffith, he emphasized film editing, setting his films apart from most of the products of this very early period. His film editing was especially noteworthy in his 'Scenes Of True Life' series, a realistic group of films he directed beginning in 1908. Next to Griffith, Blackton was probably the most innovative and creative force in the development of the motion picture art, not only as the director of hundreds of films but also as organizer, producer, actor, and animator. He pioneered the production of two- and three-reel comedies and starred in one such series as a character called Happy Hooligan. Beginning in 1908, he also pioneered the American production of distinguished stage adaptations, including many Shakespeare plays and historical re-creations. When the output at Vitagraph became too heavy for one man to handle, he initiated the system (later to be adopted by Ince) of overseeing the work of several underling directors as production supervisor. In 1917 he left active work with Vitagraph and began independent productions. During WWI, he directed and produced a series of patriotic propaganda films, the most famous of which, and which he also wrote, was The Battle Cry of Peace (1915), based on a hypothetical attack on New York City by a foreign invader. Blackton later went to England, where he directed a number of costume pageants, two of them experiments in color. When Vitagraph was absorbed by Warner Bros. in 1926, Blackton retired. He lost his entire fortune in the 1929 crash and was forced to seek work on a government project in California. Later he was hired as director of production at the Anglo-American Film Company, where he worked until his death. Between 1900 and 1915, Blackton was president of the Vitaphone Company, a manufacturer of record players. In 1915 he organized and became president of the Motion Picture Board of Trade, later known as the Association of Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. He was also publisher and editor of Motion Picture Magazine, one of America's first film-fan publications.\n\nGenial, dark-haired, often bespectacled Ivan Lawrence Blieden (pronounced Blee-den), better known as actor Larry Blyden, was born in Houston, Texas, the son of a lawyer. He developed an early interest in acting, appearing in various theater productions as a teen but never entertained the notion of pursuing a career. Following a stint with the Marine Corps, however, he went to college at the University of Houston and supplemented his income with a job as a local radio announcer, finding himself highly proficient at foreign accents.\n\nBitten by the acting bug, he decided to give performing a serious try this time, first training at London's Royal Academy of Arts, then moving to New York. It was Broadway that subsequently gave Larry marquee value, contributing strongly to a string of successes. These included not only such staple comedies as \"Mr. Roberts\", \"Oh Men! Oh Women!\" and \"Absurd Person Singular\", but the musicals \"Flower Drum Song\" (Tony nomination), \"The Apple Tree\" and \"A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum\", the last earning him the Tony award in 1972.\n\nFrom the early 1950s throughout the decade, Larry was a valuable presence in TV anthologies (\"The Silver Theatre,\" \"The Philco Television Playhouse,\" \"The Goodyear Playhouse,\" \"Armstrong Circle Theatre,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"The Alcoa Hour,\" \"Play of the Week\") but, as his career progressed, he also found a comfortable niche in breezy comedy, landing a couple of sitcoms Joe & Mabel (1956) (as Joe) and Harry's Girls (1963) (as Harry), short-lived as they were. Into the 1960's he appeared on such programs as \"Thriller,\" \"The Loretta Young Show,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Adventures in Paradise,\" \"The United States Steel Hour,\" \"Route 66,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"12 O'CLock High,\" \"The Fugitive\" and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\"\n\nLarry projected a very temperate, clean-cut, albeit bland image. As a result, film roles were scarce - three to be exact: Kiss Them for Me (1957) starring Cary Grant and Jayne Mansfield, Die Junggesellenparty (1957) with Don Murray and Carolyn Jones, and Barbra Streisand's Einst kommt der Tag (1970).\n\nLarry was a noted game show enthusiast and was seen frequently as a panelist on Password (1961) and To Tell the Truth (1969), among many others. In 1972, he became a familiar daytime face after replacing Wally Bruner as host of the syndicated What's My Line? (1968).\n\nLarry married Bob Fosse dancer/extraordinaire Carol Haney in 1955. They remained a popular Gotham couple until their split seven years later. Haney, who was pure electric in the Broadway and film versions of \"The Pajama Game\", was a severe diabetic and died suddenly at age 39 in 1964, two years after their divorce. This left Blyden a single parent with two children to raise. He never remarried. His last performances on TV included guest parts on \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Medical Center\" and \"Cannon.\"\n\nBlyden himself died fairly young as well, killed in a car accident while traveling in Morocco. He was only 49. Highly personable and modestly unassuming, Larry Blyden may not have hit the heights, but he was a recognizable name and a durable talent - one of Broadway's bright lights for over two decades.\n\nBorn on September 30, 1947 in London, England, Mark Bolan was always destined to be a star. Even as a teenager, he was already seeking fame. Well known as a sharp dresser, he was employed by a modeling agency and became a \"John Temple Boy\", wearing John Temple suits in their catalogs as well as becoming a cardboard cutout displayed in their shop windows. Many initial attempts to get into the music business failed, and so he turned to acting, landing several character roles in some television series including a juvenile delinquent on the Sam Kydd series Orlando (1965). His first recording, \"The Wizard\", was released in 1965 and resulted in an appearance on the music show Ready, Steady, Go! (1963). He briefly became a member of the 1960s group John's Children before forming his own group, Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nThe group's first single was \"Debora\", also a track on the album \"My People Were Fair\", released in July 1968. Although not a hit the first time around, on its re-release in 1972, when Bolan was at his peak, \"Debora\" made the UK top 10. In July 1969, the group dropped its folksy, hippie sound to go electric with the single \"King of the Rumbling Spires\". Unfortunately, like his other singles, it failed to take off, only reaching #44. The group shortened its name to T. Rex and finally broke through with the single \"Ride a White Swan\" in 1970. This opened the door to a whole series of hit singles, including \"Bang a Gong, Get It On\"--on which Elton John played keyboards--which reached the US top 10 in 1971, as well a series of highly acclaimed albums.\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Bolan had a string of #1 hit singles in the United Kingdom and became a teen idol as well as a leader of the glam rock movement. He appeared in Ringo Starr's movie Born to Boogie (1972), a documentary showing a concert at Wembley Empire Pool. However by 1975, on account of the rise of 1970s soul music, Bolan's career was in decline, at least sales-wise. As a leading figure of the punk rock movement in the United Kingdom, he provided a forum for new acts to appear on television via his own music program. Just when he was on the rebound, Marc Bolan cruelly died in a car crash on September 16, 1977, two weeks before his 30th birthday.\n\nClifford Lee Burton was born on February 10, 1962 in Castro Valley, California, to Janet (Morgen) and Ray Herbert Burton. He had two siblings. His mother was from a German Jewish family, and his father was of British Isles descent.\n\nAs a youngster, Clifford always liked music, listening to genres such as blues, classical, country and jazz, and he even liked the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He loved all kinds of music, and when he attended college he became educated in music theory. At the age of six he learned to play his first instrument, the piano. When he became a teenager he learned to play the bass guitar and took lessons from September 1978 to January 1980. He had played in several bands before he joined a band that would later go on to become one of the most popular and successful bands of all time.\n\nIn 1982 he played at the Whiskey A-Go-Go in Los Angeles and was spotted by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, who were forming a heavy metal band and were searching for a new bassist with creativity. The two had gone to the Whiskey A-Go-Go at the recommendation of Brian Slagel of Metal Blade Records. Hetfield and Ulrich were greatly impressed with Burton's bass playing and asked him to join their band, Metallica. At first Burton didn't want to join Metallica, but agreed to join if the band was willing to relocate to San Francisco, which they did. Burton went on to perform on the band's first three albums (\"Kill 'Em All\", \"Ride The Lightning\" and \"Master of Puppets\"), which all became hits, and with these three albums he instantly became a favorite musician amongst many music fans, with his impressive bass playing, powerful stage presence and very opinionated and honest personality. Things were looking bright for Burton but, sadly, his life was cut tragically short in 1986. After Metallica had finished touring with Ozzy Osbourne in 1985 they began touring in 1986. On the morning of September 27 the bus the band was touring in was driving from Stockholm, Sweden, to Copenhagen, Denmark, to perform some more gigs, and it went into a slide on some icy roads. Burton was thrown out of the bus' window and the bus fell on its side and crushed him. His Metallica bandmates were devastated over Burton's death, as were the band's fans. Burton was a powerful force in Metallica and his loss is seen by many as one of the most tragic losses in the history of music, which it is, because Burton was extremely talented and helped to contribute to some of Metallica's most successful songs. Not only that, but his live performances were also very powerful and he was very friendly and down-to-earth, very honest and opinionated and always willing to express his thoughts and feelings.\n\nMetallica paid tribute to Burton by releasing the home video _Cliff 'Em All (1987) (V)_ and by using several unused riffs and a poem of his on their song \"To Live Is To Die\", which appeared on their acclaimed 1988 album \"...And Justice For All\". Burton may be gone, but he'll never be forgotten, and he will always be remembered by both Metallica and their fans, as well as music fans in general, and his contributions to the music industry are some of the finest that were made.\n\nAlbert Camus was born on November 7, 1913, in Mondovi, Algeria. His parents were Spanish-French-Algerian (pied noir) colonists. His father, Lucien, died in the Battle of Marne (1914) during WWI. His mother, named Catherine Helene Sintes was of Spanish origin, she was a deaf mute due to a stroke, but she was able to read lips and worked as a cleaning lady, providing for her son, who loved her to tears.\n\nCamus studied at Algiers Lycee from 1923-32, then at the University of Algiers, from where he graduated in 1936 with a degree in philosophy. While a student he joined the French Communist Party in 1934, but in 1936 he joined the 'Le Parti du Peuple Algerien' and was denounced by communists as 'Trotskyite'. He was seriously influenced by the writings of 'Andre Malraux', 'Andre Gide' and Plotinus' theory of the \"One\", which became Camus' graduation thesis (1936).\n\nHe was rejected from the French army because of tuberculosis, which he contracted in the 1930's. His first marriage to Simone Hie, a morphine addict, ended due to infidelity from both of them. In 1940 Camus married a pianist and mathematician Francine Faure, whom he loved and patiently tolerated her affair with the actress María Casares. Camus and Francine Faure had twins born in 1945.\n\nDuring the Second World War Camus was a writer for 'Paris-Soir' magazine. He was in Paris during the Wermacht occupation, and witnessed the execution of the French communist and anti-fascist activist Gabriel Peri by firearm, which turned Camus' mind against Nazi Germany. He moved to Bordeaux, where he finished his early works, 'The Stranger' and 'The Myth of Sisyphus', which opens with his famous statement about the philosophical question of suicide, and deals with the absurdity of existence in the meaningless struggle.\n\nCamus joined the French Resistance cell 'Combat' and edited the eponymous paper under the pseudonym 'Beauchard'. He reported on the fighting when Allies liberated Paris in 1944. Camus continued his work for 'Combat' until 1947, and through this work he became acquainted with Jean-Paul Sartre. For a couple of years Camus was a member of Sartre's circle at the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard St. Germain, but Camus' criticism of communist doctrine soon alienated Sartre. He highly regarded Franz Kafka and William Faulkner, whose 'Requiem for a Nun' he adopted into a play.\n\nCamus' lectures about French existentialism brought him on a 3-month tour of the United States and Canada in 1946, where he spoke at several universities. He lectured for 3 months in Brazil, Argentina and Chile in 1949, where he became sick and almost suicidal. The return of his tuberculosis forced Camus into seclusion from 1949-1951. It was during those 2 years that he crystallized his analysis of rebels and revolutions and published 'The Rebel'. The book clearly formulates his rejection of communism as well as any violent activity under various Utopian masks of 'social justice'.\n\nAlbert Camus' desire for clarity and meaning in the world that offers nothing, but chaos, resulted in his work on the idea of absurdism. It was incorporated in many of his works from 'The Myth of Sisyphus' (1942), 'The Plaque' (1947), 'The Rebel' (1951), and other works. Camus' ideas resulted from his philosophic analysis of the diverse list of sources from 'Epicurus' to Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and 'Andre Breton', as well as his own experiences in the war and his studies.\n\nHis greatest work 'The Fall' (1956) presents the monologues of a self-proclaimed 'judge penitent' Clamence, whose character alludes to Zarathustra from Friedrich Nietzsche and Grand Inquisitor from the 'Karamasov Brothers' of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Camus challenges the reader with the dilemma of accepting the absurdity of our existence and/or learning how to deal with it as well as with the unpredictable consequences from doing something about it.\n\nCamus was the proponent of the idea of human rights. He resigned from UNESCO in 1952 in protest of the UN acceptance of Spain under 'Edgar Franco 'El General''. He protested against the Soviet crush upon the East Berlin workers in 1953, and against the Soviet repressions in Hungary in 1956. He was a steady supporter of pacifism and was in opposition to capital punishment. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHe was killed in a car accident on January 4, 1960, in the small town of Villeblevin, France, in the car driven by his publisher and close friend Michel Gallimard, who also died in the accident."
