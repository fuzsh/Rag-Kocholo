        "text": "These days, escaping a busy work schedule goes beyond unplugging and taking a break from social media. With unbelievable traffic and unending to-do lists, we long for quick getaways or a few minutes spent outdoors – surrounded by trees and a calming landscape.\n\nWith towering buildings dominating the skyline, you might think it’s impossible to enjoy a piece of nature in the city. Lucky for us, there are still hidden gems within the metropolis that you can visit. If you live in Quezon City, there are gardens and parks that are worth checking out so you can skip La Mesa Eco Park. Dreading the long drive to the North? These green spaces are definitely worth it:\n\nNinoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center\n\nNestled in the heart of Quezon City, the Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center boasts of 22.7 hectares of open spaces, trees, and facilities that allow you to commune with nature. The zoological and botanical garden has a lagoon, a fishing village, and facilities that cater to different events.\n\nWhile you can walk around the place to your heart’s content, you can drop by the Wildlife Rescue and Research Center where you can see wild animals that were saved from illegal poachers and traders. The rescue center is open from Tuesday to Sunday. Consider visiting on a weekday to avoid crowds.\n\nEntrance fees are Php30 for adults, Php15 for students, and Php100 for foreigners.\n\nElliptical Road, Diliman, Quezon City\n\nBalara Filters Park\n\nWho would have thought there’s a park within a water treatment facility? The Balara Filters Park is a surprising recreation spot in Quezon City where you get to travel back in time and marvel at Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe 60-hectare park features an elevated picnic grove, a mini-park for kids, and buildings that stood the test of time. Must-sees include the Balara Filtration Windmill, a replica of the Carriedo Fountain, and the Anonas Amphitheater. Some key features within the park might not be accessible, though, as recent visitors noted that there are areas in need of repair or closed for renovation.\n\nDiliman, Quezon City\n\nQuezon Memorial Circle\n\nThere’s more to this circle apart from the famous Quezon Memorial Shrine. If you’re brave enough to conquer the traffic, a calming escape awaits within the QC Circle. Get ready to explore four gardens on your free day – the Tropical Garden, the Hardin ng mga Bulaklak, the Runnex Elevated Garden, and the Rock Garden.\n\nBring a book as companion or rent a bike and make the most of the open space. Forget that you’re in the middle of a busy city and take in the beauty of nature as you roam around.\n\nElliptical Road, Diliman, Quezon City\n\nBernardo Park\n\nTake a trip down memory lane and visit Quezon City’s first public park. Aside from having a swimming pool, it also has a children’s playground and spaces that are ideal for biking and skating. Go here for a peaceful run in the morning or a relaxed bike ride in the afternoon.\n\nEpifanio de los Santos Avenue, Quezon City\n\nDon Jose Heights Park\n\nWhether you’re up for a run or a challenging workout, the Don Jose Heights Park is the perfect stop. Those who want to sweat the stress away go here for a quick jog or exercises best done with friends. Since it’s found near the Don Jose Heights Clubhouse, expect events and gatherings being held on some days. Relish the peace and quiet by visiting early in the morning.\n\nDona Carmen Avenue, Quezon City\n\nIf coming home to serene surroundings that will remind you of open parks is something you’ve been dreaming about, you can make it happen by choosing a home that lets you rest easy while providing the convenience of city living. The Residences at Commonwealth by Century offers uncommon beauty, spaces, amenities, and value as Century Properties’ first vertical village project that marries groundbreaking architecture with state-of-the-art landscaping.\n\nDesigned by Broadway Malyan, the same team behind Azure Urban Resort Residences and Acqua Private Residences, The Residences at Commonwealth by Century features open spaces such as the sloped garden, the yoga deck, and the Great Lawn where you can enjoy the rest you deserve. To complete the park-like environment, water features like fountains and pools will soon be seen in the property to add to the Zen vibe. If you need a space where you can indulge in your hobbies – whether it’s music, art, cooking, or fitness – the newly opened clubhouse is the place to be.\n\nWho knew you could enjoy fresh air and serenity in Quezon City? The Residences at Commonwealth by Century has eight multi-level towers that have a cranked design that maximizes sunlight and air circulation. Residents can also take in the beauty of the amenity complex on one side or marvel at an unobstructed view of the city on the other from a spacious balcony. With these features, homeowners can come home to unparalleled comfort and peacefulness every day."
