        "text": "Quezon City, chartered city and capital of the Philippines from 1948 to 1976. The city is located immediately northeast of Manila, in central Luzon.\n\nNamed for President Manuel Luis Quezon, who selected the site (formerly a private estate) in 1939, it officially replaced Manila as the capital in 1948. Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939â€“45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976."
