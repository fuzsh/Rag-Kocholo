About us

The parish of White Ladies Aston with Spetchley and Churchill has three churches, one in current use and two 'redundant' churches, Spetchley and Churchill which are both Grade II* listed buildings managed by The Churches Conservation Trust.

There is an annual service in the summer at All Saints' church, Spetchley, and a carol service is held every year in St Michael and All Angels church, Churchill.

Regular services are held in St John the Baptist church, White Ladies Aston with the monthly pattern as follows: 1st Sunday Evensong or Songs of Praise at 6pm; 2nd Sunday Family Service at 10.30am; 4th Sunday Holy Communion at 9am. Every quarter we host the Joint Benefice Communion service at 10.30am. All of our services are updated on this website.

St John the Baptist is part of the 'Bowland' Benefice of churches comprising All Saints' Spetchley, St Michael and All Angels Churchill, St Leonard's Broughton Hackett, St Kenelm's Upton Snodsbury and St Nicholas' Peopleton. The Benefice is named after the Bow brook which runs close to all of the villages.
