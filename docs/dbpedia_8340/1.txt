Spetchley

Descriptive Notes

Beside the road from Worcester to Stratford, All Saints’ Church adjoins Spetchley Park and its gardens. The church is a simple early14th century building, with a tower added within the west end of the nave in the 17th. Its glory is the south chapel, added in 1614, containing an outstanding series of monuments to the Berkeley family who owned the Park (and still do), some with good effigies and all with a fine display of heraldry. Particularly splendid is the central monument to Sir Rowland Berkeley (d. 1611) and his wife, lying under an arched canopy with obelisks at the four corners.[40]

In 1940, during World War II, top secret plans were drawn up but not implemented, for the evacuation of Winston Churchill and his key staff to Spetchley Park. [The National Archives]

A free-to-view site is being developed at freecen.org.uk for the 1841, 1851, 1861, 1871 and 1891 censuses. Coverage of Worcestershire parishes is rather sparse at this time.
