The church is a simple early14th century building, with a tower added within the west end of the nave in the 17th. Its glory is the south chapel, added in 1614, containing an outstanding series of monuments to the Berkeley family who owned the Park (and still do), some with good effigies and all with a fine display of heraldry. Particularly splendid is the central monument to Sir Rowland Berkeley (d. 1611) and his wife, lying under an arched canopy with obelisks at the four corners.[40]\n\nIn 1940, during World War II, top secret plans were drawn up but not implemented, for the evacuation of Winston Churchill and his key staff to Spetchley Park.

The 1911 census is available in full or in part on some of these sites. We are unable to advise on the choice of site since researchers' personal preferences will be influenced by the content and search facilities offered by each site. Some sites offer a free trial.\n\nAccess to the library edition of Ancestry.co.uk is widely available at most record offices, including Worcestershire Archives, and some libraries. You are advised to book time on their computers before making a visit.\n\nA free-to-view site is being developed at freecen.org.uk for the 1841, 1851, 1861, 1871 and 1891 censuses. Coverage of Worcestershire parishes is rather sparse at this time.\n\nCensus returns can usually be viewed at Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' Family History Centres.\n\nSome repositories offer census details on microform, disc or printed copy.
