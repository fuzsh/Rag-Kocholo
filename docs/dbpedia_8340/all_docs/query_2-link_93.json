        "text": "Or erstwhile St Peter. You see the earlier church was dedicated to the fisherman from Galilee and the saintly dedication was changed to James, son of Zebedee and brother of John, in the 1870s. More about that later.\n\nBishampton, with its prominent (and open) church is a delightful village of about six hundred souls. It has all the facilities and activities that a 21st century rural community needs: A pub (The Dolphin,) a general store and Post Office, and a modern village hall that seemed to be fully booked with clubs and other social and educational groups. The 1913 History describes it as being located “in the south-eastern part of the county of Worcester. It is bounded on the north by Whitsun Brook, which ultimately runs into the River Avon, and is divided on the east from Church Lench by some wooded hills 300 ft. above the ordnance datum. These hills form the highest part of the parish, the north and east being at about 100 ft. above the ordnance datum. The area of the parish is 1,910 acres; 1,032 are arable, 733 acres are permanent grass, and 32 are woods. The soil is chiefly marl clay and the subsoil partly Lower Lias and partly Keuper Marl. The chief crops are wheat, beans, barley, turnips and garden produce.” [1.]\n\nNoakes is ever-so-slightly sneering about the place. “No railway or canal touches the parish, and there are no resident gentry. The church, which has Norman and Perpendicular work in it, seems to imply, by its size, and the venerable grove of trees leading to it, a greater importance than the village to which it belongs can now justly claim.” [2.]\n\nI parked my car in the new church car park and was immediately impressed by the well-maintained churchyard and paths. The church itself is set on a mound and has a solid-looking air about it. The parish history leaflet describes the tower as 14th century (cf. Mee. 15th century [3.]) but the rest of the church as a reconstruction, maintaining the Norman “footprint” and using the original stones, in 1870. No matter – it was open and welcoming.\n\nAnd it was tidy! Nothing out of place and not a speck of dust to be seen. Add to this that the many flower arrangements were still fresh from Sunday (I visited on Tuesday) and it all added up to being a lovely place to visit.\n\nBeing Victorian there was not much in the way of architectural detective work to be done here. This was more a place to sit quietly and offer thanks for such a beautiful building and thriving parish community. And work out the three gems to be found here.\n\nFirst the impressive font. Clearly 12th century (although the base is modern and tasteful) and carved with bands of roses, crosses and stars.\n\nSecond the Victorian stone pulpit. This was commissioned for the reconstruction in 1870 with the intention of including a stone icon of St Peter (the patron saint) in its design. The story goes that the pulpit arrived – only with a statue of St James incorporated. And so the church was promptly re-dedicated!\n\nAnd thirdly, within easy arms length of the pulpit, the metal hourglass used (in its day) for the timing of sermons!\n\n[1.] A History of the County of Worcester. 1919. Volume 3.\n\n[2.] Noake’s Guide to Worcestershire. 1868. Page 47.\n\n[3.] The King’s England. Worcestershire. Arthur Mee. 1968 New Edition.\n\nOrdnance Survey Grid Reference. SO988513.\n\nHaving disparaged five of the seven churches in the aforementioned benefice (see previous post) my sense of guilt and balance drives me to write flatteringly about the two churches that were open that day. And so I came to a jewel in an ecclesiastical crown that is Throckmorton Chapelry.\n\nThe name Throckmorton (a family name) comes from the Anglo-Saxon word Throc (which means drain) so this is really Morton’s Drain. Mee goes even further and writes that “it is said to derive from a stretch of water with a wooden platform for washing.” [1] Washing what? He is also somewhat dismissive of the hamlet saying just two sentences later, “The only feature of the place is the church.” Historically he is inaccurate for there is a splendid Tudor house, now Court Farm, and two ancient moats. There are also excellent examples of timbered cottages, as well as the typical Worcestershire red brick. And for those who like poking around WW2 sites there is the adjacent airfield which was RAF Pershore . Built in 1940 it was a base for Wellington bombers, housed Vulcan bombers in the 1960s, and remains partially operational. On a diocesan note, until the Victorian age Throckmorton was in the parish of Fladbury to the south, but boundaries and pairings have all changed many times. And there was and is no saintly dedication.\n\nThe church, which carries the title of Chapelry (i.e. It was annexed to a primary parish church), is approached over a modern cattle grid with wooden side gate, and up an unpaved track lined beautifully with young trees. All around is farmland and the noise of hens and sheep drown out the birdsong! And because beasts and fowl roam this glebe that is without clearly defined paths let the pilgrim or visitor be warned. There are perils underfoot. Everywhere.\n\nThe church of THROCKMORTON consists of a chancel 12½ ft. by 16 ft., a central tower 11½ ft. by 13½ ft., a nave about 45 ft. by 17½ ft., and a small south aisle 4½ ft. in width. These measurements are all internal. [2] The first sight of the building is one of those “Wow!” moments, for the tower is central and it’s immediately apparent that this is ancient stone. In fact much of the building is 13th century, but even that was a “later” building. Damp-proofing work, the bane of all clergy and PCCs, revealed earlier stone foundations. And county archeologists have identified a Saxon village on higher ground and a possible wooden church site. So this is an old Christian site indeed.\n\nAs if we needed more proof of antiquity there are records of monks at “a minster” (Fladbury? Pershore?) sending priests here in AD 697.\n\nThis is a beautifully ordered church. The font is of uncertain pedigree, plain and plastered over, and has been moved at least once from its original soak-away drain. Mee says it is “thought to be Norman, altered at a later time.” [3] There is clear evidence of a pre-Reformation rood screen, as well as doors and windows being closed up over centuries. The medieval chancel is quite magnificent with two Tudor chairs and a small piscina of trefoil design on the south wall. (And no, it didn’t hold flowers!) And the place is light – there is no stained glass.\n\nThree gems? Firstly the tower itself, about which a history book could be written about its changes over time. Second the four gargoyles on the upper storey of the tower – the 15th century belfry. One of a monkey, one of a monster, one of a man with a very large nose (said to be a bishop!) and one of a lion. (There is also a corbel of a man’s face now resting on a window ledge, the victim of a zealous puritan.) Sadly my limited camera that day could not capture these high carvings so you’re just going to have to take my word for it!\n\nAnd oddly enough in third place is the fact that the church still lights its way using oil lamps and candles due to the lack of electrical connection.\n\nOn to Bishampton, shortly…\n\n[1.] The King’s England. Worcestershire. Arthur Mee. 1968 New Edition. Page 168.\n\n[2.] A History of the County of Worcester. 1913. Volume 3.\n\n[3.] Mee. Ibid.\n\nOS Grid Reference. SO980496\n\nOn Thursday, 15th May 2014 I visited a group of country churches in the Deanery of Pershore, Worcestershire. The Benefice of Abberton, Bishampton, Flyford Flavell, Grafton Flyford, Naunton Beauchamp, North Piddle, and Throckmorton. It was a bright and sunny day and my mother had packed me a lunch of thickly-cut ham and cheese sandwiches, crisps, fruit, chocolate, and two bottles of pop. (“Are you sure that that’ll be enough?) I had high hopes that day as I drove east on the A422, past Spetchley Church (now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust) and took the small B road south to Naunton Beachamp. I parked in a small space near the gate of St Bartholemew’s Church (15th century tower) and wandered through the unkempt grass of the churchyard. I tried the door. It was locked.\n\nOn to Bishampton St James and then the Throckmorton Chapelry. To my delight both buildings were open. More about them in the following posts!\n\nThen to North Piddle St Michael and All Angels (a medieval church rebuilt with an interesting avenue of Irish yew trees.) It was located on a leafy cul-de-sac where a surly man with a huge machine was clearing the drainage ditches by the roadside and who seemed quite put out that he had to move his digger to allow me to pass to the church. It needn’t have mattered. It was locked.\n\nSo was Flyford Flavell St Peter’s (Norman origin with later additions) and Abberton St Edburgha (1881 construction using medieval stones as outer cladding.) Likewise St John the Baptist at Grafton Flyford (14th century tower) which has been locked on my every attempted visit over the years.\n\nIt was lunchtime so I pulled off the road and sat on a stile where the path led alongside a cornfield and on to what looked like an old apple orchard. It had been a generally frustrating morning but lunch restored my morale. It is always uplifting to spend time at peace in the Worcestershire countryside, and a picnic adds to this! It was a warm early afternoon so I made my way to the Boot Inn at Flyford Flavell (14th century with later additions!) for a thirst-quenching pint of shandy. It was a good place to reflect on the perceived but disappointing need to keep churches locked. And with the two exceptions within this Benefice I tried to understand the issue. It wasn’t a common pattern in this part of rural Worcester because all around the county churches are either open to visitors or else a key is made available close-by. No, it was simply the singular practice of this Benefice.\n\nAdd to these thoughts of mine the fact that, according to Church of England information, the incumbent does to even live within her own Benefice but in another village, and I wonder even more if these delightful churches are taken seriously as places of pilgrimage and visit. Or are they just taken for granted? And locked accordingly.\n\nWhen tramping around the rural churches of any county food is of the essence, and that day I had stopped my car in a narrow lay-by on the A422 west on Inkberrow and munched my way through a cheese and onion pasty and a Snickers bar. The nearby farm gate read Quarry Pit Farm and I wondered what type of quarry it had been in its day. There was nothing marked on the map and so that would remain an unanswered question.\n\nThree quarters of a mile after lunch I turned right into a narrow lane that led uphill to the hamlet of Dormston. I had heard of its church and even though I grew up just three miles as the crow flies to the west I had never seen it! And it’s easy to miss for it is a very tiny parish.\n\nDormston (Deormodesealdtune in the 10th century and Dormestun just a hundred years later) is first mentioned in history when, and we don’t know the exact year, King Edgar the First (“The Peaceful” 943-975) gave lands in the village to the monks of Pershore Abbey some sixteen miles away. As an aside Edgar was not a very popular man. He was described as “extremely small both in stature and bulk.”[1.]\n\nThe County History describes Dormston as “a small parish, which contains only 820 acres, lies on the road from Worcester to Alcester, which runs through it on the south. On a road branching north from this is the small and scattered village, which consists of a few old cottages grouped round the church.” [2.] A short but accurate visual description.\n\nNoakes twins Dormston with the neighboring parish of Kington, describing their populations as “limited and straggling.” Of interest he also notes the poverty of the place. “Kington is what is called a ” discharged rectory,” value only £100; while Dormstone, a “perpetual curacy exonerated,” is but about £50! If both livings were held by the same gentleman (as they should be) he would be by no means a subject for envy as a pluralist!” [3.]\n\nApproaching the church the first things one sees is the black and white tower which is of 15th century origin, and leans ever-so-slightly. (Or was it me?) Mee describes these churches with half-timbered constructions as “Forest Churches” [4.] but I’ve looked and dug and for the life of me can’t figure out where he got that term. But who am I to argue with the venerable Arthur Mee?\n\nIt’s a glorious church inside and out! Avoiding architectural terminology I might describe the interior as “light and messy!” Large, plain glass windows, almost disproportionate in size to the south wall, catch the sun perfectly. This is very much a 14th century nave – the chancel was rebuilt much later in the 19th century but is in keeping with the older lines. The rear pews of the church, which on that day held a variety of second-hand books for sale watched over by a teddy bear, were described in the guide leaflet as “old” but no date was offered. I suggest that they were early 16th century.\n\nThe font is plain and 15th century, but parish history records that a part of a Norman font bowl was found buried under it, pointing to a much earlier church building on this site.\n\nThere is a rather fine example of a Tudor age chair in the sanctuary on which I duly sat for a while, wondering who might have sat there before me.\n\nAnd there is a wonderful story about the dedication of the church. For years the name of the patron saint was unknown, but an erstwhile vicar of Dormston, the Reverend TP Wadley (dates unknown at time of writing but I will look further) came across a number of papers which included the last will and testament of a Thomas Hemmyg, 1512, who left a bushel of barley to:\n\n“Eccile sci nycolla de Dormystun.” (To the church of St Nicholas at Dormston.) And so the name was given, or re-given at that moment. [5.]\n\nThree gems? Well, firstly the tower. Whatever its correct architectural name it is quite magnificent. Secondly the late 14th century roof beams are superb.\n\nAnd finally the invisible but audible treasures that are three bells in the tower which have been rung down the centuries. Dated and inscribed they are:\n\nGod Save Our King 1640\n\nJesus Be Our Speed 1631\n\nSancta Maria Ora Pro Nobis (15th century with Lombardic letters.)\n\nO that they would have been rung on the day of my visit!\n\n[1.] Gesta Regnum Anglorum.

Arthur Mee. 1968 New Edition. (The King’s England.)\n\n[5.] Parish History Leaflet\n\nOS Grid reference: SO9857\n\nI was looking forward to visiting the parish church of SS Peter and Paul in Birtsmorton, a straggling village that is difficult to geographically describe as it has little shape or form. But the church was locked and there was no mention of a key being available. A shame, because cruciform church with a 14th century tower sounded appealing. As did ancient alms boxes carved from tree trunks – not to mention the tomb of Admiral Caldwell (died 1718) who was the second husband of Catherine Nanfans of Birtsmorton Court (next to the church and now one of those ghastly wedding venues) who went on to marry two more times and had a bit of a name around the village. But it was not to be. Even the rafters of the porch shouted out “Closed!” as the photograph shows.\n\nSo I went for a pint of shandy in the Farmers’ Arms in the hamlet of Birts Street instead.\n\nIt was a fine afternoon so I spread out my Ordnance Survey map on a table outside the pub and studied my next move. I noticed that about half a mile from where I was sipping there was marked a “Church with Spire.” There was nothing on my list of Church of England buildings so I assumed it was another flavour of Christianity. And it was.\n\nBirts Street lies in the northern part of the parish of Birtsmorton (church closed) and is described in A History of the County of Worcester (1924) as a “small agricultural parish lying between Castlemorton on the north and Berrow on the south. Its southern boundary is formed by a brook which flows from Birtsmorton to Longdon. The parish has a total area of 1,291 acres, of which 240 acres are arable land, 871 acres pasture and 14 acres woodland.” Which is a much better description that that offered by Wikipedia. “Birtsmorton is a village and civil parish in the Malvern Hills of Worcestershire, England.” Incidentally the 1924 History goes on to state that, “the population is now chiefly agricultural; the women were formerly employed in glove-sewing.” Fascinating.\n\nOn this street a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the revival year of 1844. (Given the common custom of non-conformist women to wear gloves in church there would have been no shortage in the community!) I’m trying to find out more about its construction and perhaps its worship and activities but am not uncovering much at the moment. None of the weightier histories mention it but I’m hoping that Malvern Library may be able to dig out a few facts for me. All I know is that the chapel closed in the late 1980s as the congregation dwindled, and that the building and land were sold into private ownership. The chapel is now a private residence.\n\n[1] History. Volume 4. 1924. William Page & JW Willis-Bund, editors.\n\nBirtsmorton Village. Grid Ref. SO799355\n\nEven though it was a long time ago my boyhood impression of St James, Huddington, was that it was a dark, dusty and generally untidy place. And I’m pleased to say that not a lot has changed in half a century. The gloom is not due to the lack of windows but because the small church is hemmed in, especially to the east and west, by tall yew trees that even on the brightest of days prevent the sun’s light from directly entering.\n\nThe north doorway (and wall with lancet window) is Norman. An upper door arch was added in the 15th century but it is in keeping with the original. That sums up this little church. Much of the building has been restored over the centuries but all the work has been done sensitively and in harmony with earlier construction. Even the 16th century roof (which would have replaced an earlier thatched roof) makes use of four ancient tie beams from the original structure. The one big disappointment is that the medieval priests’ door in the south chancel wall, sealed up with stone after the Reformation, remains closed. When the “modern” restoration was completed in 1900 they missed a trick there!\n\nWhat more is there to see? There’s clear evidence of Puritan vandalism to image niches either side of the east window and a piscina on the south wall of the chancel. There is some fine wooden paneling and Jacobean furniture – notable a communion table with turned legs that now serves as the altar. And my pew. Did I mention my pew just inside the plain and simple 17th century chancel screen? It’s where I would sit when my father took the service from his stall opposite, or from the altar. Out of sight and harm’s way. I’m willing to bet that few people have sat there since!\n\nMy three gems in and around St James’ Huddington? First the font which is plain and simple and of early 15th century origin. But its base is made of a different stone and suggests that it once supported an earlier Norman (possibly) font. The rim of this font has been damaged – evidence that the locking clamps had been forcibly removed. A reminder of different ways in different days. Baptismal water would be left in the font for a season, and practitioners of witchcraft would steal it for their own purposes!\n\nSecond the heraldic glass in a window on the west wall of the side chapel. On the upper left the Coat of Arms of Roger and Elizabeth Wintour. Lower left are the Arms of the Casey family united with the Cooksey family. (I had to look up the correct term for this and it is impaling!) And in the right window the Wintour family impaling six families into which they married. The date is 1584.\n\nAnd thirdly we must step outside the church and pause before a Calvary near the lychgate. This is a recent monument (early 20th century) and marks the spot where an unknown man was found buried. It is generally agreed that he was a Royalist fleeing the 1651 Battle of Worcester where the King’s army was routed by the Parliamentarians. Given that most of the royal army was Scottish, and that the man was found with a purse of Scottish coins, this theory makes a great deal of sense. It is also a moment to pause awhile and reflect on a man dying so far from home.\n\nA mystery with which to close. In the paneling on the south wall of the chancel, in line with the altar, there is a closet which has not been locked in recent years. (I know – I check this on every visit.) It’s clearly an ambry cut into the stone. Inside are four pieces of stone, an empty glass bottle, and a cruet which appears to contain old wine. Undisturbed and unexplained. One of these days I will write to the local clergy…\n\nGunpowder, treason and plot. A body discovered, buried with Scottish coins. Ghosts. Priest holes. Not to mention a beautiful church of 12th century origin where my father was rector during the 1960s. The village of Huddington (Hudda’s Land. He was a Saxon warrior who visited in the early 8th century and liked the place so much he moved in) has it all, which is surprising for a community whose population is no more than three dozen souls.\n\nMee describes the place as “strangely remote in this quiet country” and he was right then and now. The Victorian “County History” only offers us the rather dull geographical description of Huddington as being “In the valley of Bow Brook and the whole parish is low-lying.”At the centre of the village there is an unassuming and unsigned crossroads, easily missed when traveling east on the road from Droitwich to Grafton Flyford. Turning left will lead up the single village street, a cul de sac of six houses and Hall Farm, and a bridle path that leads to my old home some two miles away over the hill. But turning right is a step back into one of the most exciting chapters in English history.\n\nThe unmade road leads directly to Mill Farm, but the small wooden sign on the rather grand stone gatepost tells us that this is also the entrance to Huddington Court. And, of course, the way to the Church of St James. As a visitor crosses an unnamed tributary of the Bow Brook and walks south the black and white timbered belfry of the church can be seen above the tall hedges.\n\nAnd after a hundred metres, turning right through an even grander gate, the visitor comes face to face with Huddington Court.\n\nThe oldest parts of this delightful country pile date from the 1340s but the remainder of the house was built a century later. It was part of the manorial estate of the Hoddington family (Hudda’s lineage) until the middle of the 15th century when it passed by marriage into the ownership of the Winter (or Wintour) family. Now for the gunpowder, treason etc.\n\nThe history of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 may be read in countless sources, but to put it in a nutshell: It was a failed Roman Catholic conspiracy to assassinate King James the First by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. Now without excusing the intended use of a weapon of mass destruction it must be said that “Catholics” (sic) were having a hard time of it under an increasingly “Protestant” (sic iterum) establishment. But you must read about that for yourselves. Back to Huddington…\n\nThe Winter brothers, Robert and Thomas, were a part of this plan. Robert was the owner of Huddington Court, and although it cannot be proved it is entirely reasonable to suggest that many of these conspiratorial plans were drawn up in that “strangely remote” village. Who knows – perhaps even Guy Fawkes was there. What is known is that after the plot was discovered the Court was the place to which Thomas Winter and others fled. Journals record that a group of exhausted men arrived at Huddington on horseback around two o’clock in the afternoon on 6th November 1605. After brief rest, and receiving communion from a supportive priest, they left for Staffordshire (and capture) in the middle of the night.\n\nThere is a legend that Robert Winter’s widow Gertrude still walks the driveway (known as Lady Winter’s walk) at night awaiting her husband’s return.\n\nBut let’s leave the Court behind and walk across the lush and manicured lawn to the church. Through the rustic lych-gate and into the 15th century porch. A heavy door opens with the same loud grating sound that I remember from my boyhood. And we’re in!\n\nPendock (from the Welsh: “Barley Hill”) stands in a small cluster of mixed trees at the meeting of two worlds. To the east in a sheep field are the mounds and irregular hollows that are all that remains of an early medieval village. To the south, a mere two hundred feet away, the roar of the M50 motorway is an audible reminder of the twenty-first century. And yet the church maintains an air of timelessness.\n\nIt was on a late morning in May, cool and showery, that I drove slowly up the rough track to the Pendock Old Church. And that’s its name. There is no record of a saintly dedication. Declared redundant in 1987 it would either be open or, following the usual arrangements of the Churches Conservation Trust, a key would be available nearby.\n\nIt was, said the notice in the rustic yet post-Reformation porch, in Priory Court some five hundred metres to the east across the already mentioned sheep pasture. Not a long walk, but I had to set a careful course and zigzag my way through the scattered mementoes that sheep, especially frightened sheep, are fond of leaving.\n\nThe key duly collected I set back for the church only to find a playful Parson Jack Russell running ahead of me. “Don’t worry,” said the woman, “She’ll go with you. Show you the way.” And sure enough we made our way back together, the dog stopping and turning around now and again to check that I was following.\n\nOnce inside the church I was surprised at how light it was, and also how quiet – given the proximity of the motorway. The twelfth century sandstone walls continued to prove a match for modern noise! Everything was immaculately ordered and clean, so full marks to the Trust for their upkeep work.\n\nLike so many historical sites Pendock Old is a church that has evolved down the ages. There can be no doubt that there was an earlier church as the simple font (“The workmanship is rude.” [1]) can be dated to the 10th century. The existing walls have been given a date of about 1170, and the tower (“The tower is of three stages with diagonal buttresses at the western angles.” [2]) added some two hundred years later. Those “western angle” reinforcements were a defensive measure against marauding Welsh tribes in the fourteenth century – a phenomenon that is thankfully, now, only sporadic.\n\nSetting aside the fascinating architecture, the Victorian glass, and the things that are no longer there (such as the rood screen, although the access stairs are still there behind the bricked up arch near the pulpit) there were for me three other gems that were worth closer examination. The Laudian (early seventeenth century) altar rails and sanctuary chair; and the little Georgian chamber organ, last restored in 1978 and regularly maintained and played in recital.\n\nIt is rumoured, and here we must step into the realms of conjecture, that as Sir Edward Elgar had composed two short pieces for such an instrument, and as he had close connections with one Reverend William Symonds who was erstwhile rector of Pendock, that this was the instrument on which those pieces were originally tested. It’s a nice story, but who knows?\n\nI spent nearly an hour in Pendock Old Church, and emerged to a light shower of rain. I sat and sheltered on the low benches in the porch and enjoyed the ham and chutney sandwiches that my mother had wrapped for me, thinking that this was a place, peaceful and pleasant, to revisit. And wondering where that dog had gone."
