        "text": "Catholic Herald, 7th August 1964\n\nQuestions for the 'Progressives'\n\nSIR.— Like all editors you justly claim that you are\n\nnot responsible for the opinions of your correspondents and claim credit for\n\nestablishing an open \"forum\".\n\nOn the other hand you write of \"exploding\n\nrenewal\" and \"manifest dynamism of the Holy Spirit\", thus\n\nseeming to sympathise with the Northern innovators who wish to change the\n\noutward aspect of the Church.\n\nI think you injure your cause when week by week you\n\npublish (to me) fatuous and outrageous proposals by irresponsible people.\n\nFather John Sheerin is neither fatuous nor outrageous\n\nbut find him a little smug. If I read him correctly he is pleading for\n\nmagnanimity towards defeated opponents.\n\nThe old (and young) buffers should not be reprobated.\n\nThey have been imperfectly \"instructed\". The \"progressive\"\n\nshould ask the \"conservative with consummate courtesy\" to re-examine\n\nhis position.\n\nI cannot claim consummate courtesy but may I, with\n\nround politeness, suggest that the progressives should re-examine their own?\n\nWere they perfectly instructed? Did they find the discipline of their\n\nseminaries rather irksome? Did they think they were wasting time on the Latin\n\nwhich they found uncongenial?\n\nDo they want to marry and beget other little\n\nprogressives? Do they, like the present Pope, think Italian literature a more\n\nenjoyable pursuit than apologetics?\n\nThe distinction between Catholicism and Romanita\n\nhas already been stressed in the American journal Commonweal. Of course\n\nit is possible to have the Faith without Romanita and to have Romanita\n\nwithout the Faith, but as a matter of recorded history the two have kept very\n\nclose. \"Peter has spoken\" remains the guarantee of orthodoxy.\n\nIt is surely (?), a journalistic trick to write of\n\n\"the Johannine era\". Pope John was a pious and attractive man. Many\n\nof the innovations, which many of us find so obnoxious, were introduced by Pius\n\nXII.\n\nPope John's life at Bergamo, Rome, in the Levant, at\n\nParis and Venice was lived with very meagre association with Protestants until,\n\nin his extreme old age, he found himself visited by polite clergymen of various\n\nsects whom he greeted, as he did with the Russian atheists, with\n\n\"consummate courtesy\".\n\nI do not believe he had any conception of the true\n\ncharacter of modern Protestantism. I quote from an article in Time\n\nmagazine of 10th July: \"The one persuasive way of referring to Jesus today\n\nis as a 'remarkably free man'. After the Resurrection the disciples suddenly\n\npossessed some of the unique and 'contagious' freedom that Jesus had. In\n\ntelling the story of Jesus of Nazareth, therefore, they told it as the story of\n\nthe free man who had set them free… He who says 'Jesus is love' says that\n\nJesus' freedom has been contagious… Van Buren concludes that Christianity will\n\nhave to strip itself of its supernatural elements … just as alchemy had to\n\nabandon its mystical overtones to become the useful science of Chemistry.\"\n\nThese words are not those of a Californian crank but\n\nof a clergyman of the \"Episcopal Church\" of America, who derive what\n\nOrders they have from the Archbishop of Canterbury. I am sure that such\n\nquestions were not raised on the much publicised meeting of the Archbishop and\n\nPope John.\n\nFather Sheerin suggests that Catholic Conservatism is\n\nthe product of the defensive policy necessary in the last century against the\n\nnationalistic-masonic-secularism of the time. I would ask him to consider that\n\nthe function of the Church in every age has been conservative — to transmit\n\nundiminished and uncontaminated the creed inherited from its predecessors.\n\nNot \"is this fashionable notion one that we\n\nshould accept?\" but \"is this dogma (a subject on which we agree) the\n\nFaith as we received it?\" has been the question (as far as I know) at all\n\nGeneral Councils. I have seen no evidence that Pope Paul [sic] had anything\n\nelse in mind when he summoned the present Council.\n\nConservatism is not a new influence in the Church. It\n\nis not the heresies of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the agnosticism\n\nof the eighteenth century, the atheism of the nineteenth and twentieth\n\ncenturies, that have been the foes of the Faith turning her from serene\n\nsupremacy to sharp controversy.\n\nThroughout her entire life the Church has been at\n\nactive war with enemies from without and traitors from within. The war against\n\nCommunism in our own age is acute but it is mild compared with those fought and\n\noften won by our predecessors.\n\nFinally, a word about liturgy. It is natural to the\n\nGermans to make a row. The torchlit, vociferous assemblies of the Hitler Youth\n\nexpressed a national passion. It is well that this should be canalised into the\n\nlife of the Church. But it is essentially un-English.\n\nWe seek no \"Sieg Heils\". We pray in silence.\n\n\"Participation\" in the Mass does not mean hearing our own voices. It\n\nmeans God hearing our voices. Only he knows who is \"participating\" at\n\nMass. I believe, to compare small things with great, that I\n\n\"participate\" in a work of art when I study it and love it silently.\n\nNo need to shout.\n\nAnyone who has taken part in a play knows that he can\n\nrant on the stage with his mind elsewhere. If the Germans want to be noisy, let\n\nthem, But why should they disturb our devotions?\n\n\"Diversity\" is deemed by the Progressives as\n\none of their aims against the stifling Romanita. May they allow it to\n\nEnglish Catholics.\n\nI am now old but I was young when I was received into\n\nthe Church. I was not at all attracted by the splendour of her great ceremonies\n\n— which the Protestants could well counterfeit. Of the extraneous attractions\n\nof the Church which most drew me was the spectacle of the priest and his server\n\nat low Mass, stumping up to the altar without a glance to discover how many or\n\nhow few he had in his congregation; a craftsman and his apprentice; a man with\n\na job which he alone was qualified to do.\n\nThat is the Mass I have grown to know and love. By all\n\nmeans let the rowdy have their \"dialogues\", but let us who value\n\nsilence not be completely forgotten.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEvelyn Waugh"
