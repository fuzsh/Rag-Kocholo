        "text": "General collection information\n\nThis collection contains images of transcripts created for Anglican Bishops, of Church of England marriages and banns from the county of Worcestershire, England.\n\nBefore civil registration began in 1837, key events in a person's life were typically recorded by the church, rather than the government. Parish records were the first sets of vital records kept; they often date back to the 16th century and are some of the longest running records available. Churchwardens were compelled to send transcripts of all baptisms, marriages and burials for the previous year to the Church of England Bishops and these are known as Bishop Transcripts.\n\nUsing this collection\n\nThis collection may include the following details:\n\nName\n\nEvent type\n\nMarriage or banns details\n\nNames of parents\n\nName of spouse\n\nThese records were taken by church officials to mark important milestones in people's lives. This makes them excellent resources for tracing family roots. They often include information about other family members such as parents, which makes it easy to go back a generation in your family tree with a single record.\n\nBanns were church announcements of a coupleâ€™s intention to get married. This gave time for the parish to submit objections. Banns may also list whether a person had been previously married.\n\nHistory of the collection\n\nWhen Henry VIII established the Church of England, he mandated parishes to keep handwritten records of baptisms, marriages, and burials. Beginning in 1598, clergy were required to send copies of their parish registers to the bishop of their diocese. These copies are known as Bishop's Transcripts and are useful in cases where original records are unreadable or no longer exist.\n\nThe Lord Hardwicke Marriage Act of 1753 established a separate register for marriages and required that marriages be performed only in Anglican churches.\n\nIn 1812, George Rose's Act called for pre-printed registers to be used for separate baptism, marriage, and burial registers as a way of standardising records."
