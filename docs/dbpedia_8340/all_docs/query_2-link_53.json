        "text": "Malc H says:\n\nSt Thomas a Becket Romney Marsh\n\nRomney Marsh is an aberration. To add an extra layer of opaqueness to this mysterious landscape, it is actually composed of three marshes: Walland Marsh, skirted by the railway line; Denge Marsh, which sounds like a tropical disease and occupies the south; and Romney Marsh proper to the north and east. In its wintry nakedness the landscape is comprised mainly of blank meadows that struggle to clamber above sea level. They are separated by an arbitrary arrangement of neat hedgerows. Some empty roads knit the farms and the occasional straggle of cottages together, but have little sense of purpose in this cul-de-sac for the nation.\n\nThe waterways are more distinguishable features: notably the Royal Military Canal, dug to amputate the marsh from the rest of Britain as a last line of defence against Napoleonic expansionism. But what keeps the land above water is a network of ditches and sewers - \"sewer\" being the local term for \"big ditch\". Much of the work was carried out in the 15th century, when a tax called a \"scot\" was imposed on the owners of low-lying land; those lucky to live on higher ground escaped the tax, which led to the expression \"scot-free\".\n\nThe main attractions in the marsh are the churches, most of which have outlived their congregations. The Romney Marsh Historic Churches Trust looks after 14 of them, and the ruins of four more. Of them all, the most singularly beautiful is St Thomas à Becket in Fairfield.\n\nDifficult to find it's on the lane that leads south from Appledore. Or, rather, off the lane, floating serenely in a field that turns out to be an island.\n\nTraditionally in the English countryside, a church is at the heart of the village. Fairfield is unusual in that there is no village. Before the Black Death swept through these fields and claimed many of the people of the marsh, there may have been a real community. But - and back to that handy church guide - since the start of the 19th century, the census returns for the three square miles of Fairfield parish have never reached three figures. The highest, in 1831, was 89; at the last count, a century later, it was 61 and falling.\n\nThe church's origins are medieval, its exterior 18th century. But the interior is like no other church I have seen. British aisles tend to be much of a muchness: channels between neat rows of pews. But the aisle at St Thomas à Becket is like a corridor. As you walk along it, you pass white compartments - box pews - in which families would face each other, rather than the preacher.\n\nHe could keep an eye on everyone, though: the mahogany pulpit is a triple decker. The parish clerk sat at the bottom, the main service was conducted from the middle level, while a sermon \"often of prodigious length\" was delivered from the top. Even the font is an oddity, with seven sides.\n\nA sense of otherworldliness grows the longer you spend in Romney Marsh and the stories that go with it even more so. The church is rumoured to be have been founded by either an unnamed medieval traveler or the Archbishop of Canterbury who fell into a deep dike. Sinking in the water, he prayed to Thomas à Becket to save him as he came up for the first time, promised the saint he would build him a church as he surfaced for the second, and was rescued by a farmer on the third.\n\nWho knows ... but if ever you find yourself in the area then seek this place out because it really is worth a visit.\n\nages ago\n\nTaron Curtis says:\n\nST LEONARD CHURCH\n\nThis church was built between 1087-1215\n\nIn Frankley but within the worcestershire border.\n\nSaint Leonard's serves a friendly and welcoming congregation and is located in a surprisingly pretty rural setting despite being surrounded by large Birmingham estates. It is very old, tracing its origins back to 1087, and the Saxon stone base of the churchyard cross indicates that Christians have worshipped here for generations.\n\nOur sister church at St Christopher's Holly Hill is located on the Frankley estate about a mile and a half away and it provides both weekly worship and a base for the active Frankley Church Community project which we share with our Methodist friends in this ecumenical partnership. Each Sunday in term time at 4pm the Sunday Crew hold lively all-age worship there.\n\nSaint Leonard's is very popular for weddings and baptism services. In order that these are properly prepared for the families concerned get to know us in our Sunday worship first. We have interviews on Wednesday evenings at 7-8.30pm in the hall next door.\n\nThis is a small church - seating a little over 100 people- and is cosy and comfortable. It is easy to see why it is considered an attractive venue for weddings and Blessings. We also have a very skilled and enthusiastic group of flower arrangers who really come into their own when there is a Christian festival.\n\nOur members take their part in helping the church link with the wider Frankley community especially through the Church Community Centre at St Christopher's Holly Hill.\n\nThe churchyard is beautifully kept and provides an oasis of quiet tranquility for the many visitors who come to pray, recollect or just sit where generations have been before them.\n\nIt would make a great place for a church quiet day with the practical facilities next door in the new church hall and excellent parking available and no difficulties for wheelchair users or other disabilities.\n\n© All rights reserved.

It was probably built on the site of an earlier Saxon church dating from the first days of Christianity in Yorkshire.\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of 1066, the lands of Speeton were bestowed, by various owners, on the Augustinian Priory at Bridlington. Eventually almost the whole of the present parish formed part of the Priories' estates. Speeton church depended upon Bridlington churchmen for religious administration» In 1290, Edward I granted the prior and canons free warren over many manors including Speeton. A parochial chaplain is first mentioned in 1451. The gift of so much land is evidence of a great religious devotion on the part of many previous residents of the village. The church is dedicated to St. Leonard, who lived in the sixth century and became the patron saint of prisoners and captives. He ministered to slaves and prisoners in an age when the threat of such a fate hung over everyone. His feast day is November 6th.\n\nSpeeton church seems to have had a peaceful existence until the reign of Henry VIII and the Dissolution of the Monasteries. During the Reformation, the churches frescoe of the Crucifixion, stone altar, vestments, votive lights and probably a statue of St. Leonard himself were all removed. After the Reformation, Robert Denison became the proprietor of Speeton, his family remaining patrons until Lord Londesborough sold his lands earlier this century. The Chantry of St. Leonard in Speeton Chapel had owned land in other parishes, e.g. Harpham, before the Reformation. The 'Chapel of Speeton' was mentioned in the Parliamentary survey of 1650. It had tithes worth £50 p.a. which were the property of Sir Michael Wharton. The chaplain's salary is recorded as £3. 12s. Od. (£3.60) per annum. At this time the preaching minister was one Richard Broderick, a puritan, who also preached at Bempton. This connection with Bempton church was to continue until 1919, when Speeton was merged with Reighton to form a \"United Benefice.\"\n\nIn the eighteenth century big box pews and a three decker pulpit were provided, while the font was moved into the chancel. As with most small churches of the period, the curates were absentees. In the years 1743 to 1764 the curate lived at Hunmanby but this was much closer at hand than was the case with most absentee curates. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the incumbents at Flamborough and Bempton often conducted services at Speeton. The fact that the church was often empty at this time has led to the belief that it may have been used by smugglers to store their takings before distribution. Only one service was held every six weeks in 1743.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the church must have presented a somewhat run-down appearance. A visit by the local topographer Reverend Prickett, led him to report in 1831 that, \"Speeton Chapel is only an oblong room.\" The east end of the church was being used as a school. The church was probably the one visited by Charlotte Bronte in 1852, when she tells that, \"It was certainly not more than thrice the length of our passage, floored with brick, the walls green with mould, the pews painted white, but the paint almost worn off with time and decay.\" She also recorded the humourous situation of the choir facing away from the congregation.\n\nReverend George Alcock, who wrote the history of Speeton Parish and Church in 1936 spoke with many people who remembered the church in the latter half of Victoria's reign. The box pews were occupied by farm labourers from the 1860's until much later, while other pews came to be regarded as belonging to certain farmers and their tenants. Reverend Alcock records, however, that Speeton never indulged in the sin of charging pew rents.\n\nDuring the period 1865-70 the chancel was used, once again, as a school. The average daily attendance in 1865 was twelve. In this year the Minister stated that \"nearly all the inhabitants attented both church and chapel.\" Some attended on alternate Sundays which perhaps explains the co-operation between the religious houses concerning the harmonium, which was used at the church for one service and then moved to the chapel for the next. This seems to have become an established tradition by the early years of this century.\n\nThe lack of burial ground meant that coffins were often carried by the pall bearers to Bridlington Priory. It was customary for the bearers to refresh themselves at the Nags Head near the Priory, at the end of their arduous journey and if time allowed, to call there again before starting back to the village. This custom continued to almost within living memory and a well worn track once existed to mark the funeral route. When the railway was constructed, a new road was built and the old track gradually fell into disuse.\n\nIn the later years of the nineteenth century, continuing into Edwardian times, the farmers occupying the three neighbouring farms made themselves responsible for the churches upkeep. This system, which worked in rotation, was so successful that collections for church expenses were unknown before 1906.\n\nThe dilapidated condition of the church remained a problem, however with plaster falling from the roof, even during services. Reverend John Wilkinson Vicar of Bempton and Speeton in 1905-14 undertook to restore the building. A bazaar was held at Millholm Farm, a new organ was bought, the box pews, pulpit and plaster ceiling were removed. Smaller pine pews were built and erected on the spot. The new pulpit was part of a stall given to St. Mary's Bridlington by Mrs. Greenwood Clayton. The tiles were replaced by a brick floor and two lancet windows were made in the west wall on either side of the tower. The font was moved from the chancel to the west end and an altar cross set up on the altar. Most of this occurred in 1911\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nIn Memoriam: HJSP82 edited this topic ages ago."
