        "text": "A tiny atmospheric church\n\nAn atmospheric church in a tiny village, St Michael's is mainly of the fourteenth century, although fragments from an earlier building are built into its walls.\n\nThe font is fifteenth century and there is good woodwork of the seventeenth century. Two strange stone carvings built into the sill of the north window appear to be parts of a lion.\n\nThe low chancel screen and the lectern came from Great Malvern Priory in 1910, when a major restoration of St Michael's was carried out.\n\nThe small bellcote contains two bells, one dating from the fifteenth century.\n\nPlease make a contribution towards the upkeep of this church via our at our red donate button. A donation can also by made by texting \"CHU\" to 70970 to donate £5 or 70191 to donate £10.\n\nThank you"
