        "text": "When I take photographs or when I am sent photographs as e-mail attachments, I save them on my computer's hard disc. These are then copied and one copy used to be saved onto a disc but are now saved onto the smaller, more convenient USB keys, which have a much larger capacity and, I understand, are less prone to failure. The other copy is edited, compressed and reduced in size and transferred to the web pages which, in due course, are uploaded on the web site on the internet. The first photographs thus were saved onto a number - half a dozen or more - discs but a number of years ago I transferred all the material from these discs onto USB keys.\n\nUnfortunately just one disc had become corrupted in some way and the photographs could not be recovered or transferred and were lost: these were from Worcester Cathedral and York Minster, all taken by me, and several photographs from Worcestershire all sent to me; and possibly others The only copies of these were on the web site pages and were really too small, necessarily so because originally I had limited web space. These photographs cannot now be enlarged but I have tried to reedit and improve them.\n\nI must point out that the faulty disc was manufactured by Philips; all the others which were perfectly satisfactory were from other companies.\n\nYou will notice some of these images in Worcestershire, most in Worcester Cathedral (when it is uploaded) and all in York Minster (when it is unloaded)\n\nRichard Barnaby (1597) & Mary (Abington/Habington)(1574) Sandstone. Note the helmet which is positioned between the heads of the main figures.\n\nThe superstructure of the monument is shown in more detail in the final figure William Wolstenhulme Prescott (1865) He contracted a fever after tending his dying gamekeeper and died at twenty-one: the scene on the side panel of the tomb chest refers to this incident.
