        "text": "A Ringers Guide to Towers in Worcestershire\n\nCompiled by David P. Bagley. Thanks to Chris Pickford for much of the more up to date information.\n\nUpdated 1/6/2020.\n\nDisclaimer : Most of the comments in this list are based on my own (personal) impressions of the towers on the day when I visited them. No responsiblilty is taken for the validity of the data, but I do my best to keep it as accurate as possible. If you have any suggestions and/or changes, please E-mail me on\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W\n\nAbbots Morton, S Peter, 4 bells, Tenor 6.75cwt, Grid Ref: SO027550, CHIMING ONLY\n\nThe tower, which dates from c1400, is thought to be unsafe. The tenor bell may well have been hung soon after the tower was completed and is one of about ten \"Royal Head\" bells left in the county. They have the heads of Edward III and Queen Philippa as word stops. The Mears bells were supplied through \"Mr Savory\" [probably William Savory] of Painswick, a bell hanger. The frame is his, but Thomas Mears supplied four headstocks and four wheels in 1842. The frame is positioned diagonally in the tower, as at Powick, Strensham and Croome D'Abitot. The fittings are derelict, with the wheels and stays missing, and the headstocks decaying. The tenor has now been hung 'dead' by Arthur Berry.\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1842, 4-0-20\n\nThomas Hancox II, Walsall, 1633\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1842, 5-1-18\n\nWorcester Foundry, c1410, 6.75cwt in A sharp\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nAlvechurch, S Laurence, 8 bells, Tenor 12-0-1, Grid Ref: SP027724\n\nThese used to be very toneless and oddstruck bells, but since their 2012 restoration, are an excellent eight. Access is in the north west corner, outside the tower. The church car park is to the south west of the church, but watch out for the one way streets. The upper stages of the tower bear the date 1676 which is when they were rebuilt, but the lower parts are somewhat older than this. The frame and fittings are by Whites in 2012.\n\nWhitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd, 2012, 4-0-11\n\nWhitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd, 2012, 4-2-10\n\nJoseph Smith, Edgbaston, 1711, 5-2-4\n\nJoseph Smith, Edgbaston, 1711, 5-3-18\n\nJoseph Smith, Edgbaston, 1711, 6-2-16\n\nJoseph Smith, Edgbaston, 1711, 7-1-16\n\nJoseph Smith, Edgbaston, 1711, 9-0-2\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1845, 12-0-1 in G\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, C.J.Pickford 1993, Dove online)\n\nAreley Kings, S Bartholomew, 6 bells, Tenor 8-1-3, Grid Ref: SO802710\n\nThe bells are quite good, but the tower is a little cramped. There is plenty of parking by the church gates. The porch tower is on the south side of the church, and the tower door is to the left as you enter it. The bottom of the tower is 14th C, and the top stage is 15th C. The former ring were Rudhall bells. The tenor was recast by Blews of Birmingham in 1867, and again in 1905 by Mears & Stainbank of London. The frame and fittings also date from 1905-6 and are by W. Greanleaf and Tristram. The bells were tuned by Taylors in 1938 and the ball bearings were overhauled during May 1993 by Arthur Berry.\n\nGeorge Mears, London, 1859, 3-1-14\n\nGeorge Mears, London, 1859, 3-2-26\n\nGeorge Mears, London, 1859, 3-3-17\n\nGeorge Mears, London, 1859, 4-1-26\n\nGeorge Mears, London, 1859, 5-3-25\n\nMears & Stainbank, London, 1905, 8-1-3 in B flat (8-2-16 pre 1938)\n\n(Data:Walters 1930,C.J.Pickford 1993, 14/2/2003)\n\nAshton under Hill, S Barbara, 6 bells, Tenor 7-1-16, Grid Ref: SO997377\n\nThe bells are in the west tower which is 13th C. The frame is a steel frame installed by John Taylor of Loughborough in 1964. All are hung on cast iron headstocks with ball bearings, also dating from 1964. The fifth is a thin casting and is lighter than the fourth. The tower entrance is via a small set of outside steps on the north side of the tower. The ringing chamber is somewhat cramped, but the bells go well, and sound good. Parking is in the road at the end of the church path.\n\nGillett & Johnson, Croydon 1946, 4-2-3\n\nCharles & John Rudhall, Gloucester, 1785, 4-2-19\n\nCharles & John Rudhall, Gloucester, 1785, 5-0-0\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1827, 5-1-24\n\nCharles & John Rudhall, Gloucester, 1785, 5-1-12\n\nCharles & John Rudhall, Gloucester, 1785, 7-1-16 in A\n\n(Data:Bliss+Sharpe, The Church Bells of Gloucestershire 1973)\n\nAstley, S Peter, 6 bells, Tenor 14cwt, Grid Ref: SO787676\n\nThese were rehung in 1992 by Eayre & Smith Ltd in a new metal frame. The headstocks on 1, 4, 5 and tenor have been replaced. The 2nd and 3rd still have their wooden headstocks and canons, but are to be rehung on metal headstocks soon. The bells sound good and, apart from the 2nd and 3rd, go very well. The remains of the old rope guides are still in place, and obstruct the ropes, especially the 2nd. The 15th C tower is at the west end, and the tower door is inside the church in the north east corner of the tower. Parking is quite easy outside the church, in a specially built church car park. The bells are the remnants of a Rudhall ring of 1728, with three bells recast by different founders at different dates. The wheels (except the 4th) are those made by Charles Carr in 1897, and the original Carr ground pulleys are in a box in the ringing chamber.\n\nAbraham Rudhall II, Gloucester, 1728\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1806\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1838, 6-3-0\n\nAbraham Rudhall II, Gloucester, 1728\n\nAbraham Rudhall II, Gloucester, 1728\n\nCharles Carr, Smethwick, 1897, 14cwt in F sharp\n\n(Data:Walters 1930,C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBadsey, S James, 8 bells, Tenor 15-0-4, Grid Ref: SP071431\n\nThese are rung from a gallery at the back of the church, access to which is up a flight of wooden steps inside the tower. The bells have a fine tone, and go well. Parking is in the road outside the east and west ends of the church. The frame dates from 1899, and is by John Taylor, of Loughborough, who also rehung them in 1950.\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1902, 4-1-18\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1902, 4-3-22\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 5-1-22\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 5-3-6\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 6-3-15\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 8-0-14\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 11-2-11\n\nWilliam Clark, Evesham, 1706, 15-0-4 in F\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBeckford, S John the Baptist, 6 bells, Tenor 13-3-0, Grid Ref: SO976358\n\nThis is a glorious village church, with a tall central tower. The bells are quite fine, and go well. The tower door is around the back of the church, and parking is available in the large layby by the church gates. The tenor note of E is rather low for the weight, but it is still not at all thin sounding. The 1804 Rudhall catalogue mentions a ring of, 6 here.\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1697, 5-1-6\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1954, 5-2-14\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1697, 6-1-4\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1953, 8-0-17\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1953, 11-2-0\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1697, 13-3-0 in E(!)\n\n(Data:Bliss+Sharpe, The Church Bells of Gloucestershire 1973)\n\nBelbroughton, Holy Trinity, 6 bells, Tenor 9-3-24, Grid Ref: SO919769\n\nThe six bells hang in the 15th C west tower, and are rung from the ground floor. The inside of the church is very well kept. The bells go well, and sound good, having been rehung in 1972-3 by John Taylor, Loughborough. The former tenor, by Thomas Mears in 1840, was scrapped; the front five were retuned, and a new treble cast. There is some parking in the road outside the church, and the entrance is through the south porch.\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1972, 3-3-13\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1781, 6-0-6\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1781, 6-1-4\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1781, 7-1-11\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1781, 7-3-14\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1781, 9-3-24 in G\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBengeworth, S Peter, 6 bells, Tenor 10.5cwt, Grid Ref: SP045436, RINGING SUSPENDED\n\nThe are now unringable due to the poor state of the frame and fittings. The bells were recast out of five bells from the old church, which were probably by one of the Bagley family.\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1872\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1872\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1872\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1872\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1871\n\nWilliam Blews and Sons, Birmingham, 1872, 10.5cwt in G\n\n(Data:Walters 1930)\n\nBeoley, S Leonard, 8 bells, Tenor 10-2-20, Grid Ref: SP066697\n\nBeoley bells are rung from a gallery at the back of the church, access to which is via some rather steep wooden steps and through a trap door. They go quite well, and sound nice. There is plenty of parking by the church gate. The west tower dates from c1400. The bells were rehung in a new frame and with new fittings by Gillett & Johnson of Croydon in 1948. They were augmented to 8 for the millennium, the work being undertaken by Eayre and Smith Ltd. The frame sides for the two new bells were from a disused bell frame at Cheylesmore (nr. Coventry).\n\nWhitechapel, 1999, 4-1-22\n\nWhitechapel, 1999, 4-3-9\n\nRichard Sanders, Bromsgrove, 1708, 5-1-12\n\nHenry Oldfield, Nottingham, 1622, 5-3-20\n\nRichard Sanders, Bromsgrove, 1709, 6-0-26\n\nNewcombe, Leicester, 1611, 6-2-9\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1789, 9-1-8\n\nHugh Watts I, Leicester, 1601, 10-2-20 in F sharp\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993, Robin Simmons 10/1/2000)\n\nBerrow, S Faith, 5 bells, Tenor 8-2-6, Grid Ref: SO793343\n\nThese are a wonderful sounding Gillett and Johnson five hung in a metal 'H' pattern frame designed for six bells, although not completed as such. They are rung from the ground floor. The sliders are not the usual traditional or Hastings types, but are a sliding metal bar with a peg to engage with the stay. Parking is on the grass verges around the small green in front of the church hall.\n\nGillett and Johnson, Croydon, 1915, 3-1-11 (nominal = 1290.5Hz)\n\nGillett and Johnson, Croydon, 1915, 3-3-9 (nominal = 1148Hz)\n\nGillett and Johnson, Croydon, 1915, 4-2-6 (nominal = 1078.5Hz)\n\nGillett and Johnson, Croydon, 1915, 6-0-6 (nominal = 966.5Hz)\n\nGillett and Johnson, Croydon, 1915, 8-2-10 in A (nominal = 860Hz)\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, DPB 28/9/2002)\n\nBewdley, S Anne, 8 bells, Tenor 15-2-23, Grid Ref: SO786753\n\nThis church is in the middle of the road away from the west bank of the river Severn. Access is via a spiral staircase in the outside south wall of the tower. The tower was built in 1696, and the bells were rehung with new Taylor fittings in 1984, much of the work being undertaken by local ringers. Parking is not easy anywhere close to the church, but there are some car parks by the river, downstream of the bridge. These bells are a complete ring by Thomas Rudhall, who was running the Gloucester foundry between 1761 and 1783. At this time, Bewdley was a busy river port, and it is probably safe to assume that the bells were carried up the river Severn from Gloucester.\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 5-1-15\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 5-2-11\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 5-3-21\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 7-2-25\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 8-1-8\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 8-2-6\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 12-1-0\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1780, 15-2-23 in F\n\n(Data:Walters 1930,C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBirlingham, S James the Apostle, 6 bells, Tenor 10-0-20, Grid Ref: SO932432\n\nThese bells go quite well, but are slightly odd-struck. The belfry is currently very dirty with birds nesting amongst the bells. Access to the gallery is from inside the church, through the right hand of the two doors, and up a short vertical ladder. The ringing chamber light switch is at the bottom of the tower, to the left of the two doors. There is parking on the triangular grass verge opposite the village hall. The Bagley foundry was based mainly at Chacombe, near Banbury, but various members of the family set up foundries in other places at various times, such as Ecton (Northants.) and at Evesham. They are renowned for casting bells with many decorations, and for bad spelling of the inscriptions. The bells were rehung using the original frame in 1980 by Taylors, and the old treble and 2nd by William Bagley (1692) were recast.\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1980, 5-0-4\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1980, 5-0-18\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1748, 5-1-23\n\nHenry Bagley II, Chacombe, 1685, 6-0-4\n\nHenry Bagley II, Chacombe, 1685, 7-1-14\n\nHenry Bagley II, Chacombe, 1685, 10-0-20 in F sharp\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBirtsmorton, SS Peter & Paul, 4 bells, Tenor 9cwt, Grid Ref: SO801355, UNRINGABLE\n\nThe bellframe is now derelict, and the bells must not be rung. They are far from tuneful, being roughly the front four of a six. The frame is in four separate pieces, having a central portion for the 3rd, and three beams poorly wedged into the S,W and N tower windows for the other bells. The stays and sliders are the metal peg and latchet type. The clappers have wooden tops, and the wheels have large wooden wheel stays to strengthen them. The headstocks are straight elm beams.\n\nJohn Martin, Worcester, 1665\n\nJohn Martin, Worcester, 1665\n\nRobert Crowch, London, c1440-1480\n\nThomas Hancox I, Walsall, 1630, 9cwt in A\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1970, DPB 1988)\n\nBishampton, S James, 6 bells, Tenor 10-2-4, Grid Ref: SO990518\n\nA small amount of parking is available at the end of the church path, south of the church. The entrance to the ground floor ringing chamber is through the south porch of the church. The bells go well and sound quite nice. They are a little quiet inside the ringing chamber, unless the tower door is opened. The original six bells, of which just the 5th was recast soon afterwards, were ordered from Matthew Bagley while he was at Evesham. He actually started casting bells at Chacombe, Northants., in 1679, moving on to Evesham in 1687. He was already engaged in the work for Bishampton when he died in 1690, and William Bagley had to come down from Chacombe to complete the business. The fifth, probably a bad casting, was recast shortly afterwards by Richard Sanders of Bromsgrove. The bells were completely rehung and retuned by Taylors in 1937 in a new steel frame, and are hung on cast iron canon retaining headstocks, with Hastings stays and ball bearings.\n\nWilliam Bagley, Chacombe, 1690, 4-1-2\n\nWilliam Bagley, Chacombe, 1690, 4-3-8\n\nWilliam Bagley, Chacombe, 1690, 5-1-12\n\nWilliam Bagley, Chacombe, 1690, 6-1-19\n\nRichard Sanders, Bromsgrove, 1705, 8-1-23\n\nWilliam Bagley, Chacombe, 1690, 10-2-4 in G\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBredon, S Giles, 6 bells, Tenor 18-2-2, Grid Ref: SO919369\n\nAn inspection in November 2003 has shown that the bells, fittings, frame and tower are in sound condition, so that the bells could be rung again after many decades of silence. The bells were rung from the ground floor of the church for the first time on 5/9/2004. Previous to this, access to the ringing room was by means of a ladder to reach iron rings high in the wall below a trap door. The frame by Warners in 1914, is made out of riveted sections, and the bells (except the treble) are hung on self aligning plain bearings with riveted canon retaining headstocks, also by Warners. Nothing much is known about W. Witmore, who cast the 2nd, 3rd and tenor, but there may be a connection with a W. Whitmore who cast bells for Frocester, Glos., in 1639, now transferred to Eastington, Gloucestershire. In 1650, a \"W Whitmore\" cast two bells for the Clewer Tower at Windsor Castle, where they still form the 2nd and 3rd of the ring of eight there. The bells were augmented to 6 in December 2005 with the addition of a second hand bell supplied via the Keltek Trust. This bell was previously the 5th at Huntsham, Devon. The installation work was undertaken by Matthew Higby.\n\nJohn Taylor & Co, 1874, 5-2-20, 32.5\" (ex Huntsham, Devon)\n\nAbraham Rudhall II, Gloucester, 1733, 7-1-16\n\nW Witmore, 1624, 8-3-24\n\nW Witmore, 1624, 10-2-0\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1706, 14-0-24\n\nW Witmore, 1624, 18-2-2 in D\n\n(Data:Walters 1930,C.J.Pickford 1993, DPB 14/11/2003, 22/12/2005)\n\nBredon's Norton, Chapel of Ease, 6 bells, Tenor 6.5cwt, Grid Ref: SO931390\n\nThese are a very nice light 6, which go well, and sound good. There is a clock case in the corner of the ringing chamber which obstructs the view from the 4th. Access to the ringing chamber is up a short and steep spiral staircase in the outside of the north wall of the 13th century west tower. The unusual dedication is not found in any other church with bells. It is not uncommon for one bell in a ring from the Rudhall foundry to bear a different date, like the 4th here, and it may well be that the bell was recast under guarantee. If an inscription was required specific to the church which ordered the bells, then a new bell was cast specially. Very rarely, an inscription on a bell was removed if it was unsuitable for that church. An example of this is found at Bromsberrow, Glos. The bells were rehung in a new metal frame and augmented in 1885 by Mears & Stainbank, who also quarter turned them and fitted ball bearings in 1964-5.\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1885, 3-3-7\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1738, 4cwt\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1738, 4.5cwt\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1739, 5cwt\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1738, 5.5cwt\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1738, 6.5cwt in C sharp\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, DPB 24/2/93)\n\nBretforton, S Leonard, 8 bells, Tenor 8-3-11, Grid Ref: SP093439\n\nThe only way into the ground floor ringing chamber is by means of the west door at the base of the tower. The ropes fall quite close together, and the bells go quite well. The back six bells were rehung by Taylors in 1909, and all are on plain bearings. The two trebles are hung above the other bells.

The tower is wooden, and the ringing chamber is a wooden gallery at the back of the church. The steps to this gallery are on the left hand side as you walk towards it. The bells were rehung in 1977-8 and are an easy little ring of five, which sound very nice and clear. The frame dates from 1896 when the tower was reconstructed. The tenor is one of only a few bells from the mediaeval Gloucester foundry to still be rung. Another one in the area is the semitone bell at Great Malvern Priory. All five bells have fabricated steel headstocks, and are hung on ball bearings. The ring was remodeled in 1977, with the old 2nd (by Carr's of Smethwick, 1896) being removed from the ring, and the old treble tuned down to replace it. A new treble was then cast to complete the ring. There is some parking available outside the church gate.\n\nWhitechapel, 1977, 2-1-20\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1820, 2-3-6 (1822?)\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1820, 2-3-12\n\nCharles Carr, Smethwick, 1896, 3-1-4\n\nJohn of Gloucester ?, c1350, 4-0-20 in C sharp\n\n(Data:DPB 17/2/93, C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBroadway, S Eadburgh, 6 bells, Tenor 18-1-16, Grid Ref: SP097363\n\nThe church is situated one mile south of the centre of Broadway on the Snowshill road, and is only used for worship in the summer months. The bells were rehung and tuned by Gillett and Johnson in 1928, and are fairly heavy going. The large headstocks are canon retaining, and the frame is a metal 'H' pattern. They are rung from the ground floor in the Chancel Crossing and there are several large pews which must be removed before ringing. Parking is on the side of the road in front of the church.\n\nMatthew Bagley, 1778, 5-3-9\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1812, 6-1-0\n\nHenry Farmer, Gloucester, 1603, 7-0-19\n\nHenry Farmer, Gloucester, 1609, 10-1-18\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1812, 14-0-9\n\nJohn Rudhall, Gloucester, 1828, 18-1-16 in E\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nBromsgrove, S John the Baptist, 10 bells, Tenor 17-1-17, Grid Ref: SO957707\n\nThe tower dates from the 13th C, and was finished off in the late 14th C, the delay being caused by the Black Death. The bells are mentioned as a ring of eight in the 1804 Rudhall catalogue, and were augmented in 1816. They were rehung by Eayre & Smith in 1983-4 in a new metal frame. The bells go fairly well, but some (notably the 7th) are very odd-struck. A narrow drive leads up to the church from the east end, and there is some parking at the base of the tower. The door to the tower is through the large west entrance, and on the right. The steps are not worn, but are somewhat uneven in height, so take care when climbing up or down.

The original five bells were augmented to 8 in 1927, and again from 8-10 in 1940. Two tier 'H' pattern frame has five bells above, and 5 below, and all are hung on ball bearings with cast iron headstocks. Ringing takes place from the ground floor, and the ropes fall close together around the font at the back of the church. The bells go well, and apart from the quiet trebles, sound OK. Parking is on the side of the road running around the church, and the nearest pub is the Mug House, which is actually in the churchyard! The two trebles were cast in 1940 during World War II, which is rather unusual. The old sixth was cast in 1686 by William Huntbach of Worcester who was not a successful founder. The only bells by him still hung in the area are the unringable rings at Kington, Worcs (3 bells) and Mordiford, Herfs (5 bells).

Parking is on the road outside the church, and there is a pub/restaurant over the road from the church. A plaque above the tower steps indicates that the bells were rehung in 1963, but it does not say who carried out the work (it was probably Taylors).

The new church was probably the work of Capability Brown in 1763, but the interior decoration and furnishings are by Robert Adam. Parking is in the National Trust car park. The entrance door is inside the church on the left hand side as you walk in. The bells are hung diagonally in the tower on plain bearings. Unusually for an upstairs ringing chamber, the floor is made of stone, and has no trap door.

Parking space outside the church is very restricted, since the road is quite narrow, but there are some side streets which may be used. The third bell bears characteristics from bells of Henry Farmer (of Gloucester), John Martin (Worcester), and Richard Keene (Woodstock), but Chris Pickford believes that it is the earliest known bell by Clark and Bushell of Evesham, who also worked together to cast bells for Hinton on the Green. The frame and fittings are by Bond of Burford in 1898, but the ball bearings were installed in 1937 by Mears and Stainbank. The bells sound quite nice, apart from the 5th which is a bit sharp.

The church was started in the 1190s, and was cruciform with a central tower. All that remain of this are the old tower arches, and a new chancel was built in the 14th C.

The access is via an outside stone staircase on the north side of the tower. The bells were recast and hung in a new frame by Taylors in 1951. Parking is on the grass verge of the road. The church is mainly Norman, and the tower is 'neo-Norman' dating from the 1840s. According to H.B.Walters (1930), there were five bells, dating from 1746 (Abel Rudhall) and 1707 (Abraham Rudhall I), which must have been transferred from the old tower.\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 3-0-2\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 3-0-17\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 3-2-7\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 4-0-24\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 5-2-4\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 8-0-10 in A sharp\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nEastham, SS Peter & Paul, 4 bells, Tenor 7-1-17, Grid Ref: SO647688\n\nThese fine bells were rehung and retuned by Taylors in 1948/9, and go very well. The ringing chamber is at ground floor level, but is used as a storage room by the flower ladies, so few pots, etc, need to be removed before it is possible to ring. A small car park is next to the church.

The bells were also tuned at Loughborough as part of the restoration work. They are rung from the ground floor, and the ringing room ceiling is now of a suspended type, with the rope bosses cut into the plastic tiles. Above this, there are some large 'tripods' which were the original rope guides.

The church, however is one of the most interesting churches in the county, and is well worth a visit. Look out for the stone pig and rabbit in the porch. There are two pubs in the area, one over the road from the church, and another (The Mill) up a small lane at SO985412.

Access is from the south side of the detached tower via a spiral staircase to the old ringing chamber, from which there is a short wooden stair case into the current ringing chamber. Look out for the painted memorials to former ringers on the walls of the ringing chamber. The bells are superb in both in tone and 'go'. The twelve were cast in 1951 by Taylors and were modelled upon the eleventh at Worcester Cathedral. The semitone was cast in 1976, and the extra treble was added in 1992, giving a light 14cwt 10 with the 9th (of 12) as the tenor. There are several car parks close by, and even more pubs in the area. The corrected weights for the extra treble, the 4th, 9th and tenor are taken from Taylor's job book by Chris Povey.\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 5-2-22\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 6-1-6\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 6-2-19\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 7-1-13\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 7-2-22\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 8-0-19\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 9-0-1\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 11-0-16\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 14-2-26\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 18-2-23\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 25-3-27\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1951, 35-2-20 in C sharp\n\nSemitone bells:\n\nExtra treble: John Taylor, Loughborough, 1992, 4-3-16\n\nFlat 6th: John Taylor, Loughborough, 1976, 8-1-24\n\n(Data:The Ringing World, Christmas issue 1992, Chris Povey 17/2/05)\n\nFeckenham, S John the Baptist, 8 bells, Tenor 11-3-24, Grid Ref: SP009616\n\nParking is on the edges of the village green, not up the church drive. Access to the ringing gallery, which was erected in the 1980s, is via a flight of wooden steps at the back of the church, and through a counter-balanced trap door. The bells go well, are of good tone, and the acoustics are clear. The table of weights on the wall below the ringing chamber gives the tenor weight as 11-3-26. One bell, the 6th, was recast after it broke right off around the crown, due to the fact that the stay was too strong. The west tower, which is quite substantial, dates from the 15th C. Henry Bagley I was the first of the family to cast bells, starting in c1630, and Matthew Bagley II was the last. Matthew II retired in 1782 and died about three years later. There is a plaque on the frame which says that it was made by John Jacques Jnr, of Gloucester, and is dated July 7th 1842. There is no founders mark on the third, but the vine border is that from the Rudhall foundry, and the 1804 Rudhall catalogue shows a bell was supplied to Feckenham.

They were a complete six of 1676 by John Martin of Worcester, although one, the third, which was recast by John Rudhall in about 1814, has since been lost. The story is that it was sent to John Rudhall of Gloucester in 1814 for recasting, but never came back.

The semitone bell (the old 4th of 6) was only re-hung for ringing in 1968, and is a very fine toned bell, considering its age. Access to the ringing chamber is by about 100 steps and the door is behind the organ in the Lady Chapel, the bottom 50 or so steps are wooden, the rest being stone. Once up into the ringing chamber, there are some wooden steps back down onto the ringing chamber floor. Visitors on a practice night should turn up promptly at 7.30, when they should be able to get in without waiting too long. The east window is the largest in any parish church in England, and the mediaeval stained glass windows in the Lady Chapel dates from c1440-1506, and are the most complete anywhere in the country. The 8th and 9th bells have the inscription \"IH\", and refer to \"John Savage\" of Elmley Castle, but their origin is unknown. A similar bell hangs as part of a derelict three bell chime in Bransford Chapel, near Malvern. It has been suggested that they might be by John Higden, an itinerant founder originally from the Reading area, but the date 1611 does not tally with his known dates. The semitone bell was cast by the same founder as the tenor at Broadwas, often assumed to be John of Gloucester. There are several differences in the style and shape of these two bells to four bells at Ely Cathedral, which are now known to be definitely by John of Gloucester in 1354. However, the remaining bell at the nearby Little Malvern Priory is very much more like the Ely bells, and is almost certainly by the same founder. Before rehanging, the bells were difficult to ring mainly because of a considerable amount movement in the weak Taylor 1887 high sided 'A' frame. The frame has caused problems since it was installed, indeed the bells were actually unringable in 1900 just 13 years after it was installed. It was partially (and ineffectually) stiffened in the early 20th century, and was substantially strengthened in 2015 when the bells were augmented to 10.\n\nWhitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd, 2014, 4-2-13\n\nWhitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd, 2014, 4-3-1\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1887, 4-3-25\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1707, 4-3-20\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1706, 5-2-14\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1707, 6-1-26\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1887, 10-0-16\n\nUnknown founder, 1611, 10-3-8\n\nUnknown founder, 1611, 14-0-20\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1887, 21-0-3 in E flat\n\nSemitone bell\n\nflat 6th: Medieval Gloucester Foundry, c1350, 7-3-16 in C#\n\n(Data:The Ringing World, 19/7/1985, p617, Dove online)\n\nGrimley, S Bartholomew, 6 bells, Tenor 12-0-14, Grid Ref: SO836607\n\nThese are quite nice bells, and the tenor is the second oldest dated bell in the county. One of the disused bells in the cloisters of Worcester Cathedral is also by the same founder and is dated 1480, and these two are in fact the only dated mediaeval bells in the county. The ringing chamber is on a gallery at the back of the church, and access is via an outside covered stairway. The tower actually dates from only 1886, and so replaces an earlier one, the bells being transferred to the new one. The bells were rehung in 1932 by Taylors in a new frame and with new fittings. They also recast the treble and third, replacing bells by John Rudhall. The tenor is rather slow turning and hard going, mainly because it is a long waisted bell with the rope drawn across above the ringing chamber, but the rest go very well.

Most of the church dates from only 1858-1865, and the bells were added in 1885. The tower steps are inside the church at the base of the tower, and the ringing chamber is a little cramped.

The church itself dates from 1867-9, replacing an earlier church containing three bells. The tenor of these old bells still survives in the mission chapel at Broadheath.

The fittings are mid 19th century, and are in reasonable condition, but the 1910 clock was installed without much forethought, and the hammers and other parts of the clock prevent the treble and tenor from being swung. The organ and the clock are both in the way of the rope circle, and so the bells can not have been rung since 1910.

The original five bells were augmented to eight in 1931 by Taylors, who extended the original frame by White's of Appleton, and all are hung on plain bearings. In the early part of the century, the local band had a good reputation for striking and peal ringing. William Clark cast the back six bells for Badsey in 1706, and Michael Bushell cast a ring for Pebworth in 1707, and in the same year, they cast the middle 4 at Henley in Arden and the 4 bells at Newbold Pacey, both in Warwickshire. Both were working in Evesham at that time, probably using the Bagley foundry in \"Bell Barn\" near the Bell Tower, the site of which has been confirmed by Chris Povey.

The west tower is 15th C, and the present 4th bell was hung at that time. John Martin cast two more bells in 1664 during the Restoration period following the Cromwellian Commonwealth. There is some parking in the road outside the church. Until 1971 there were only three bells here.

The inscription and date on the third has been obliterated, but 1753 or 1755 can just about be seen. It would seem that this was an odd bell which Abel Rudhall had in stock, but which fitted into the ring musically. Rather than duplicate the inscription on another bell and include a different date, he removed them. This can also be seen at Bromsberrow, Glos. There are many instances where one bell in a ring by Rudhall has a date different from the others, but it is usually the date of a later year. Quite often, this signifies that a bad bell was replaced during the normal guarantee period of a year and a day. All six bells are hung on metal headstocks, with ball bearings, from the Whitechapel foundry in 1968.

The large west tower was added in c1400. It was at this church that Simon de Montford made his last Communion before fighting the battle of Evesham. There is some parking in the road outside the north west corner of the churchyard. The entrance is outside the tower in the north east corner of the tower. These are the only ringable anti-clockwise bells in the county. The bells sound very good, and go well, having been rehung and retuned in 1928 by Taylors. The cast iron headstocks and ball bearings also date from 1928. The wooden frame is mainly 17th century, and it is quite tall in profile.

The two tenors of an old Rudhall eight were recast at different times, and augmented by Gillett and Johnson in 1935. Access is via an outside door in the south eastern corner of the tower, and then up some clockwise and then anti-clockwise steps. For a parish church, this building is exceptionally long.

These are a nice sounding ring of six, but a very low ceiling in the ringing chamber can make the back bells a little difficult to ring. Unless you pull the rope all the way down, it is possible for the sally to remain in the clock room! The ringing chamber floor slopes somewhat. They are hung in a wooden frame with wooden headstocks on ball bearings. The tower dates from c1380. Also worth a visit is the large tithe barn next to the church, which is open during the summer months only.

The building is believed to stand on the site of a Roman temple, and artifacts from that period have been found in the churchyard. In 1264, the Prior of Pershore Abbey ordered that the bodies of all those holding land in the surrounding villages were to be buried in the Abbey, whilst those holding no land were to be buried in Little Comberton. The stone benches in the porch (dated 1639) have hands carved in them, said to be the hands of newly married brides. There are more carvings on the doorway into the ringing chamber, one hand and, below it, that of a boot. The bells are not particularly tuneful, and need pulling. The steps up the 15th century tower have two doors, one inside and one outside. Either one may be in use.

They were actually cast at Gloucester before the foundry was shut down after being bought from John Rudhall. The table of weights in the tower incorrectly states that the bells were cast at the Whitechapel foundry. The back five sound very nice, but the treble is slightly flat of its proper note. However, they go quite well. Rudhall's bell hanger, Edwin Jacques, made the frame for the bells in 1835, and the fittings were renewed by Mears & Stainbank in 1936. The access is via stairs in the north east corner of the tower (c1300), from inside the church (rebuilt 1786). Once up at the ringing chamber door, there is a ladder back down onto the ringing chamber floor.

The bells were augmented to ten in 1994 and are an excellent Taylor ring, although the brick lined tower makes the acoustics a little indistinct.

Parking is in the road outside the church, or in the car park opposite. H.B.Walters suggests a chronogram on the 5th of 1216, with an added 'D' (500), this would give 1716. However, this is too late for William Clark, and a date of c1705 is more likely. The bell is not otherwise dated.

The bells were originally all cast at the Rudhall foundry in Gloucester, as stated in the 1804 Rudhall catalogue. They were originally rung from a large ringing chamber above the chancel crossing. In the 1860s, the Abbey was restored, and the ringing chamber floor removed to let in more light to the church. To allow the bells to be rung, the architect built a wrought iron 'walled', timber platform placed in the middle of the tower on 16 inch cross beams across the void. Access to this 'cage' is first via the steps in the south (and only remaining) transept, and then across the roof of the transept. This brings you to the walkways in the central tower where you turn right, climb a short spiral staircase, and along another tight walkway. Now for the hard bit, as to gain access to the cage, it is necessary to climb an open iron spiral stair case, with a view of the floor of the church 72 feet below you through the steps. A short walk along a wooden bridge, and you are in the cage. The small bells go ok, but rope sight is difficult as the front four bells are in a straight line along one side of the cage. The condition of the tower and bells is worsening. Estimates of the tenor weight vary from 23cwt up to 28cwt, but careful measurement indicates a weight of about 25.5cwt. The fittings were renewed by Taylors in 1959 and the bells form the heaviest ring of eight in the county. The rest of the Abbey is worth visiting. It was started in c689 as a Benedictine Abbey, but was rebuilt from c1100 onwards. The nave was destroyed in 1539, and the north transept fell down in 1689. The tower is 14th C, with Victorian pinnacles.

It has now been deconsecrated, and converted into a Parish Centre. The bells are a 1715 Rudhall ring, rehung and augmented to 8 in 1981/2 after it ceased being a church. They are very nice to ring, and sound quite good. The ringing chamber may be reached up the staircase in the entrance lobby, and there are toilets inside the building.

The old frame was substantially strengthened with new RSJ supports, and is positioned diagonally, with 1,2,3 and 4 around each of the corners, with 5 and 6 in the middle of the frame. Before rehanging, the bells were not easy to ring, and problems were known about for sometime before ringing had to stop. The bells were originally a complete Rudhall ring of 6, and were mentioned in the 1804 Rudhall catalogue, but all except the treble and 4th have been recast. The old fittings were by Mears and Stainbank in 1910, who also rehung them on ball bearings a few years later. At 19-1-19, they form the heaviest ring of six in the county. Access is by an outside door in the north wall of the tower, and there is a small car park at the end of the church drive. Some parts of the north and south transepts date from late Norman times, and the tower is 15th C. The bells sound very nice, and go well.\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1705, 6-3-5\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1910, 7-0-5\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1910, 8-1-9\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1705, 11-3-17\n\nMears and Stainbank, London, 1910, 13-1-3\n\nThomas Mears, London, 1833, 19-1-19 in E flat?\n\n(Data:Walters 1930)\n\nRedditch, S Stephen, 8 bells, Tenor 10-3-12, Grid Ref: SP042676\n\nThese are a flighty ring of eight and the ropes need to be pulled straight.

The central tower dates from the 15th C, except the upper balustrade which dates from 1713, renewed in 1797. The tower entrance is through the north transcept and up a twisted wooden staircase. Interestingly, the 1804 Rudhall catalogue mentions a complete ring of six here, so the present bells must replace an earlier Rudhall ring. The inside of the church is worth examining, especially the sixteen miserichords, twelve of which depict the labours of the months. The treble is a heavy bell for its note, and is actually heavier than the 4th. The bells were rehung in a new fabricated(!) steel frame with new fittings in 1922 by Taylors.

The tower is 15th C, but the arcades date from c1200. Originally a ring of 5 by John Martin cast in 1684. The tenor was removed in 1846 and recast by C+G Mears at Rudhall's Gloucester foundry to make two new trebles and augment the ring to six. In 2000, Taylors recast the two Mears bells and cast two new bells to replace the old fifth (John Martin, Worcester, 1684, 5-1-12) and tenor (John Martin, Worcester, 1684, 9-0-15). The fourth was left untuned. The bells were hung in a new steel frame with all new fittings by Hayward Mills Associates in 2000. The bells sound very nice and go very well.

Limited ringing now takes place, but the bells are far from easy to ring.\n\nJohn Martin, Worcester, 1648\n\nBond of Burford, 1900\n\nJohn Martin, Worcester, 1661\n\nNewcombe, Leicester, 1605\n\nJohn Martin, Worcester, 1648, 18cwt in E flat\n\n(Data:Walters 1930)\n\nShelsley Beauchamp, All Saints, 6 bells, Tenor 10-1-20, Grid Ref: SO731629\n\nThese are rung from the ground floor at the back of the church, and apart from the 4th, are on plain bearings. They are not very well in tune, and are not easy to ring. Parking is in the road outside the church. It is best to park on the north side. The 14th C tower is the oldest part of the church, the rest of which was rebuilt in 1846-7. The tenor and the 4th have received attention in 1986 by Arthur Berry.

The rehanging included the replacement of the old wooden bell frame with a new metal one, recasting the old 5th (by Abraham Rudhall I in 1705), and fitting all the bells with metal headstocks with ball bearings. The ground floor ringing chamber can be accessed from the main body of the church, or from a door in the west wall of the tower. Parking is in the road outside the church. If you look in the churchyard, you may see a sunken pathway leading away eastwards from the church door. This is the site of the main street of the original village, which was abandoned during the great plague. The church is mainly 12th C Norman, but the tower is 16th C, the east arch of which is a re-used window head.\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1772, 4-2-15\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1772, 4-0-0\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1772, 4-3-27\n\nThomas Rudhall, Gloucester, 1772, 5-1-9\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1978, 7-1-22\n\nAbraham Rudhall I, Gloucester, 1705, 9-0-10 in G\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nSouth Littleton, S Michael, 3 bells, Tenor 8-1-1, Grid Ref: SP076463\n\nAlthough only a three bell tower, these are hung on modern ball bearings in a two tier six bell 'H' pattern frame, installed in 1966 by Taylors. They are worthy of mention not only because they are ringable, but because they go well and sound good. The 2nd bell is a recasting of a cracked bell by Thomas Hancox of Walsall dated 1628. Excavations in 1883 between the font and the tower found a pit containing bell metal and charcoal. It is possible that this old 2nd was actually cast on the spot in 1628.\n\nMediaeval Worcester Foundry, c1410, 4-0-17\n\nJohn Taylor, Loughborough, 1901, 6-0-0\n\nMediaeval Worcester Foundry, c1410, 8-1-1 in A\n\n(Data:Walters 1930, C.J.Pickford 1993)\n\nSpetchley, All Saints, 4 bells, Tenor 6cwt, Grid Ref: SO896539\n\nThese are a complete mediaeval four, of which only one bell, the 3rd, has an inscription. This bell is an early work of Richard le Belyetere, of Worcester, c1430. All the letters of the inscription are crowned, and he also used Royal heads as word-stops. The frame is 18th century, and the fittings are from 1904 when the bells were rehung by James Barwell and Co. The bells do not conform to any known musical scale. The tower only dates from the late 16th C or early 17th C, and so is more recent than the bells within it. The church is now in the care of The Churches Conservation Trust as are Worcester S Swithun, Croome D'Abitot and Strensham.\n\nunknown mediaeval founder\n\nunknown mediaeval founder\n\nRichard le Belyetere, Worcester, c1430.\n\nunknown mediaeval founder, 6cwt in B flat\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1970)\n\nStanford on Teme, S Mary, 4 bells, Tenor 5cwt, Grid Ref: SO703657, UNRINGABLE\n\nThe treble is the same age and founder as the ring at Martley. Tradition says that the Martley bells were cast in the churchyard there, so it is possible that the treble bell here was also cast in the locality. It was quite common for bell founders to travel on an itinerant basis in those days, stopping off where they were needed to cast a bell. The third has a long crack from the waist to the soundbow, but the tenor is a particularly fine bell, of good shape and tone. The frame and fittings are both of mid 18th century vintage, and have been neglected to the point that they are unserviceable. The safety of the tower is also questionable. The present church appears to date from 1768-9, again being younger than all of the bells it contains, probably meaning that it was rebuilt on the site of a previous church.\n\nRichard Keene, Woodstock, 1673\n\nAbel Rudhall, Gloucester, 1753\n\nRichard le Belyetere, Worcester, c1440 (cracked)\n\nRichard le Belyetere, Worcester, c1430, 5cwt\n\n(Data:C.J.Pickford 1970)\n\nStoke Prior, S Michael, 8 bells, Tenor 8-3-18, Grid Ref: SO949677\n\nThese are very loud and 'clonky' inside the ringing chamber since they are only just above the ringing chamber. It is also possible to see daylight through some of the cracks in the tower. Access is to the left once you have entered through the main door in the west of the tower. The fine looking transeptual south tower dates from c1190-1210, although the spire seems to be of a later date. Six of the bells were recast in 1948, replacing bells by Carr of Smethwick (1st,2nd:1897), Blews of Birmingham (3rd,4th,8th:1886), and Henry Bagley of Chacombe (5th:1676).

They are very high pitched for their weight, are loud in the ringing chamber, and are rather odd struck. The ringing room is up a wooden staircase, and the front bells are not easy to ring due to the proximity of the stairs and the banister. Interestingly, the Mears catalogue of 1921 gives the year of casting as 1830.

Two second hand bells (ex Kettering) were obtained from the Keltek Trust in 2016 and work to hang them is now in progress. As part of this project, the three Rudhall bells will be removed from the tower for retuning. There is some parking by the church, and the tower entrance is through the west doors, and up a few wooden steps to the ringing platform. The bells sound very nice with a good balance of volume, clarity and hum.
