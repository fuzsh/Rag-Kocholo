        "text": "If you're unable to find a school or college from the list below, you may still wish to contact other schools and colleges in your local area. Even if a school or college doesn't appear on the list, the exams officer may still be able to accept you.\n\nYou should find a school or college well in advance of the closing date for students to be entered for exams, to allow the exams officer time to process your entry and to avoid payment of late fees. Please check the entries closing dates for all exams series.\n\nAcceptance of private candidates by schools and colleges\n\nIt 's up to the school or college whether to accept private candidates. We can't ask a school or college to accept your entry. In most cases they will only accept you if they're entering their own students for the subject(s) you wish to enter for.\n\nIt's your responsibility to find a school or college for all units/components.\n\nFor new qualifications a single entry code is required and the entering centre must accept responsibility for ALL components.\n\nFor modular qualifications it may be possible to enter at more than one school or college although all entries must be made using the same Unique Candidate Identifier (UCI) number to ensure that all results are taken into account when you certificate.\n\nIf you have a physical disability or a learning disability and require any access arrangements (for example a scribe, extra time or modified papers) you need to discuss this with the exams officer. Where the arrangements involve school resources it will be entirely the decision of the school or college whether to accept your entry. You'll need to provide appropriate evidence.\n\nList of schools and colleges\n\nBelow is a general list of schools and colleges that have told us that they may be willing to accept private candidates.\n\nThe list is updated regularly.\n\nWe cannot provide you with a list of schools and colleges for a particular subject."
