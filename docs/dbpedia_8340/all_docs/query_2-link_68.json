        "text": "DaysOut\n\nGRAHAM YOUNG VISITS SPETCHLEY GARDENS\n\nIT IS SAID that during World War Two, there were plans to move Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the War Cabinet out of London to Spetchley, near Worcester.\n\nToday, the 30 acres of Victorian gardens remain one of the country’s greatest secrets.\n\nThink of a rural cross between Edgbaston’s Botanical Gardens and the Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens in Birmingham and you won’t go far wrong.\n\nEven on August Bank Holiday Monday, when I visited, you could lose yourself in this rural paradise and barely see a soul.\n\nQuite how that can be is something of a mystery.\n\nThe tea room is lovely. The loos are clean. And the gardens, containing plants from all over the globe, are world class.\n\nWhat’s more, admission for children is free. And even the parking is free.\n\nWhat more could anybody possibly want?\n\nWell, a ray of sunshine would have been nice, but, this being an English Bank Holiday we might have known that grey clouds would reign until it was almost time to go.\n\nIf they didn’t rain, they made it easier to understand how Elgar might have felt while he stayed at the cottage inside the grounds... dreaming up the magnificently moody The Dream of Gerontius.\n\nSpetchley Gardens deliberately don’t have any purpose-built play areas for children.\n\nIn truth, there’s no need. Our nippers are the first to get excited when they see a playground, but here they never even asked if there was one.\n\nThey were more than satisfied running round the gardens, playing hide and seek and exploring the ‘enchanted forest’ and an extraordinary Swamp Cyprus ‘knobbly knee tree’ by the lakeside.\n\nThe gardens are beautiful in all seasons, from the wild primroses and daffodils in the spring to the perennials and more delicate exotic flowers in the summer.\n\nThe impending autumn will see everything turning yellow, ochre, orange and fiery red.\n\nAs well as admiring all manner of plants, there’s also the chance to walk around the lake and to admire Spetchley House from a distance.\n\nIt was built in Palladian style in 1811 from Bath Stone, some 160 years after the original house was burned down to prevent Cromwell from using it as his HQ.\n\nDesigned by London architect John Tasker, during World War II the house became a centre for recuperating pilots from the 8th US airforce instead of Churchill’s office.\n\nIt remains the private residence of the Berkeley family which has owned the 4,000-acre Spetchley estate since 1606.\n\nI daresay many people would enjoy the chance to pop in to have a look were the doors to ever be opened, but, just like children don’t miss a playground, adults don’t feel short-changed either – especially when you can admire its view of the Malvern Hills from the front lawn.\n\nThere is a neighbouring church you can look inside, though – All Saints Spetchley.\n\nMembers of the Berkeley family laid to rest here include wool merchant Sir Rowland Berkeley (1548-1611) and his wife, Katherine as well as Robert Berkeley (1650-1694), twice the Sheriff of Worcester and founder of the Berkeley Hospital at the Foregate.\n\nThe lady in the tea shop was a real character in her own right. I’d only been looking at the menu for a minute when she decided to cut to the quick.\n\nShe could do us a plateful of sandwiches, quiches and scotch eggs ‘for a tenner’.\n\nThrow in two teas, three fruit drinks, a piece of lemon ginger cake and three pieces of chocolate cake... ‘and that’ll be £16.50’.\n\nThe hard sell was the last thing we were expecting, especially as we never eat scotch eggs.\n\nBut how can anyone refuse an offer like that from the old school?\n\nMeanwhile, although the estate’s deer aren’t as accessible as the ones at Charlecote Park near Stratford-upon-Avon, the estate is shortly going to be offering packs of venison and ready meals for sale for the first time.\n\nRetailing for £30, for example, the ‘Squire Pack’ will include two chops, 2 x 1lb 1oz diced meat, 2 x 6oz steaks, 2lb of sausages and six quarter-pound beefburgers.\n\nThe meat will be on sale in October, December and February. To order, call 01453 810 303 or email@berkeleyestate.co.uk\n\nVisitorInfo\n\nn Spetchley Park Gardens are at Spetchley, Worcestershire. WR5 1RS – close to the M5/J3 or take the A422 direct from Inkberrow.\n\nTel: 01453 810303. E-mail: hb@spetchleygardens.co.uk\n\nwebsite: www.spetchleygardens.co.uk/spetchleygardens\n\nn Open 11am-6pm Wed to Sun (and Bank Holidays) from Mar 21-Sep 30, then from 1pm Sat/Sun only in October.\n\nn Admission: Adults £6, children under 16, free. Students / Seniors 60+, £5.50. Adult season ticket: £25.\n\nn Only three special events have been organised for 2009 at Spetchley and the last of them will be the Armoured Picnic on October 3 and 4.\n\nSpetchley was used by the Royalists prior to the Battle of Worcester in 1653.\n\nThis weekend will once again bring both Parliamentarians and Royalists back to Spetchley...\n\nCall or see the website for details."
