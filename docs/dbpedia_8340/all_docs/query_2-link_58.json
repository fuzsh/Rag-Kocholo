More information from Helen (381490)\n\nor Janet (381379).\n\nAs I put this weekend’s Pews News together – it’s\n\nThursday – A Level exam results have been publish\n\nbringing a variety of emotions and anxieties….. Some\n\nyoung people will be joyous and looking forward to\n\nuniversity, college, apprenticeships or a working life\n\nwhilst others will feel disappointed and be despairing\n\n– whatever the day brings for those children and\n\ngrandchildren who we love, help us to reassurance\n\nthem all that life is much more than exam success and\n\nacademic achievement.\n\nHelp them all to be what they want to be not what the\n\nworld dictates they should be………\n\nThis week we are in St Kenelm’s, Upton Snodsbury,\n\nbut who was St Kenelm?\n\nLegend tells us that Kenelm was the son of a Mercian\n\nking, Kenwulph who died in 819AD when Kenelm was\n\nonly 7. Kenwulph founded Winchcombe Abbey.\n\nFamily jealousy and intrigue followed the king’s death\n\nand Kenelm (now a boy king) was beheaded and\n\nburied on the orders of his elder sister Quendryda,\n\nwhilst singing a Te Deum on a visit to Kenelstowe in\n\nthe Clent Hills. (Kenelstowe is now part of the village\n\nof Romsley) Heaven took a hand as a heavenly dove\n\ninformed the Pope of Kenelm’s murder and he sent\n\nmonks from Winchcombe to find the body and carry\n\nhim home.\n\nAs the monks approached a particular thicket near\n\nRomsley, they saw a shining light, dug and found\n\nKenelm’s body. As they lifted him up water sprang\n\nforth and out flowed a stream. These waters\n\nafterwards became known for their healing qualities\n\nand a well-head was erected.\n\nOn the way to Wincombe, Kenelm’s body rested over\n\nnight in the church in Upton Snodsbury and when\n\ncrossing the River Avon near Fladbury, monks from\n\nWorcester Cathedral claimed the body too. Eventually\n\nKenelm’s body, carried by exhausted Winchcombe\n\nmonks, and still being chased by the Worcester\n\nmonks, was within sight of Wincombe. The monks\n\nstruck the ground with a staff and a spring burst out\n\nto refresh them for the rest of the journey.\n\nSt Kenelm was buried solemnly at Winchcombe\n\nAbbey, miracles were reported at his tomb and, as\n\nmentioned in The Nun’s Priest’s Tale in Chaucer’s\n\nCanterbury Tales, the shrine became a place of\n\npilgrimage.\n\nWinchcombe Abbey, disappeared but in the parish\n\nchurch of St Peter in Winchcombe, in the 19 th century,\n\n2 stone coffins were discovered and are believed to\n\ncontain the relics of St Kenelm and his father King\n\nKenwulph.\n\nSt Kenelm’s Day is 17 July and for many years a village\n\nfair was held in Romsley to mark the day when the\n\nancient custom of ‘Crabbing the Parson’ took\n\nplace…bombarding the unfortunate cleric with a\n\nvolley of crab apples……Look out Claire your days are\n\nnumbered!"
