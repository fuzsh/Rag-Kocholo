A French composer born March 10, 1963 in Vichy.

A guitarist and composer, Bruno Letort published, in the early 1980s, a series of albums on the fringes of jazz and rock while collaborating with very many musicians from the jazz and improvised music scenes. He created his own label, Cube Music, then founded the label Signature for Radio France. A producer for France Musique, he created Tapage nocturne, a broadcast devoted to inventive forms of music.

Attracted by pluridisciplinarity, Letort has composed for the theatre, cinema, dance, video and scenography. He uses the stylistic techniques developed by the minimalists, whose relationship to pulsation fascinates him, and incorporates into it some personal elements. While he particularly appreciates writing for string quartet, he composes for all formations: Continent Obscur for orchestra, commissioned by the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France (1999); Poussière de voyages for piano and cello, first performed by the duet Arnaud Thorette and Johan Farjot (2006); Requiem for Tchernobyl, commissioned by the French State and premiered at Minsk by the Chorus and National Orchestra of Belarus conducted by Andrei Galanov (2006); Lignes for ensemble, first performed by the ensemble Musiques Nouvelles conducted by Jean-Paul Dessy with the collaboration of the illustrator Denis Deprez and the video director Yuki Kawamura (2007).

He has collaborated closely with the illustrator and scenographer François Schuiten and the writer Benoit Peeters on many projects, including L’affaire Desombres, a show premiered in Grenoble at the 38e Rugissants (2001); the scenic version of Souvenirs de l’éternel présent (2009); La frontière invisible, musical fiction first performed at the Bouffes du Nord (2014); the music for the exhibition Revoir Paris at the Cité de l’Architecture (2014); and the music of La Tour, a concert-fiction on France Culture first performed by the Orchestre National de France conducted by Jesko Sirvend with the ondes Martenot player Nadia Ratsimandresy (2017).
