        "text": "After a complete renovation, Radio France, the leading French radio Group, wished to shift its brand identity and part with its former logo created in 2005. The new Radio France logo needed to better embody the Group’s new flavour, reflecting the rise of digital, as well as its cultural and musical direction. The blue of the old logo was discarded in favour of a more energetic, less common and more modern electric blue. The change in graphic identity at Radio France then needed to be displayed at the top of the façade of the Maison de la Radio, 30 metres above ground. Classified as a “historic monument”, the façade of the “round house” is emblematic and part of Paris’ cultural landscape."
