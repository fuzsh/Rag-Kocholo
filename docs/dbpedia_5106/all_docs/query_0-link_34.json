You should not need to do the following but if, for some reason, it is not listed or a known recent version is not listed after a day or so of being available then add the following repository to your Logitech Media Server:\n\nhttps://paulwebster.github.io/RadioFrance/repo.xml If that does not work (some installations of LMS do not support https) then try http://www.dabdig.com/slimserver-rep/repo.xml - but this one might contain experimental (broken or old) versions The 'RadioFrance' plugin should then be available for installation from the Plugin menu - after a restart of LMS.\n\nOnce installed and LMS has been restarted you should play one of the supported radio stations. If the plugin is working then you should see artist details appear around the time that a new track or programme starts. You can also access the list of stations and schedules from the \"My Apps\" or \"Radio\" menu item in LMS (you can configure which one it appears under).\n\nFIP stations supported: FIP, FIP ...
