        "text": "We have a table with radio button filters and are struggling with logical wording for the labels, or specifically the label for the default option.\n\nThe tables are of people, and each person could belong to multiple teams. We have radios to filter by people in each team, as well as people not in them. The default state is just showing everyone.\n\nWe have 4-5 teams, each with similar radio groups as below. Two for example:\n\nBLUE TEAM RED TEAM (*)N/A ()Only ()None (*)N/A ()Only ()None\n\n\"Only\" and \"None\" should hopefully be obvious, but definitely open to other suggestions on those.\n\nWe are currently using \"N/A\" as the default option which will show people in or not in the team. Is there a better label for that? We've experimented with \"All\" or \"Any\", but either of those could be understood as \"all of Blue Team\", or \"any person in Blue Team\". That being said, \"N/A\" doesn't feel great either.\n\nAlso, horizontal real estate prevents us having very long descriptive labels like, \"Users on and off Blue Team\".\n\nIn my opinion, this approach is a bit convoluted, which affects the labels (N/A is really confusing, as it means \"not available \").\n\nInstead, I would suggest that you flip your logic and instead of filtering by two different variables (the teams), filter by only one variable (the players). So you can proceed something like this:\n\n() Blue team () Red team () Both () None\n\nI am not sure if you need the last variable, but I am including it as an example of how easy it would be to add more filter variables.\n\nEdit: based on your new information, the aproach still works. Check below:\n\nI'm using an IPhone 8 with a width of 375px, so you can see that it fits on small areas. Also take a look at the second option: by using checkboxes you can select all applicable items in any combination, the last checkbox is labeled \"none\" and serves as a reset (so, selecting it will deselect all other options)\n\nanswered Jul 4, 2022 at 14:41\n\nDevinDevin\n\n38.2k1515 gold badges7979 silver badges142142 bronze badges"
