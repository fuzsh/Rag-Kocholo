        "text": "The Auditorium de Radio France in Paris will host tonight a special symphonic concert dedicated to the music of composer Lalo Schifrin entitled ‘TRIBUTE TO LALO SCHIFRIN’, performed by the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Victor Jacob and with Jean-Michel Bernard at the piano.\n\nOfficial description:\n\n“The singularity of Lalo Schifrin on the chessboard of today’s music lies perhaps in his triple culture, that of a Buenos Aires native attracted by the promised land of Hollywood, after an essential passage through Paris, where he studied with Messiaen at the Conservatoire. Since 1964, the composer has been decapitating the sound of Hollywood with Bullitt, Luke the Cold Hand, the Dirty Harry saga, Operation Dragon, the television series Mission: Impossible or Mannix… Without forgetting The Fox by Mark Rydell, from which the famous Dim commercials theme comes from, nor Tango by Carlos Saura, which, in 1998, brings him back to his Argentinean roots. Enriched with tribute compositions by students of the CNSMD of Lyon, this concert will prove to what extent Lalo Schifrin holds an ideal status for the artists of the new world, that of a learned composer of popular expression.”\n\nThe program will be the following:\n\nCONCERT INFORMATION\n\nWhen: Friday, February 3, 2023 at 20:00h\n\nWhere: Auditorium de Radio France (Paris, France)\n\nTickets: 10-67 € – https://www.maisondelaradioetdelamusique.fr/evenement/concert-symphonique/lalo-schifrin-mission-impossible/prix-france-musique-sacem-de-la\n\nHand program: https://www.calameo.com/read/006296452550b5d03d937\n\nThe concert will be broadcast live on France Musique & ARTE Concert channels, and also on Facebook:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1571603629947132/\n\nhttps://www.radiofrance.fr/francemusique"
