Look out for soundtracks around lot 60, jazz vocalists in lot 98, huge funk and soul collections at lot 135, original reggae around lot 180, a rare Bowie 7″s collection at lot 240, a collection of 37 Krautrock classics at lot 247, an original Vangelis ‘Sex Power’ 7″ for upwards of €200 at lot 268 and 33 groundbreaking early electronic/ musique concrète records for €600-800 at lot 380.\n\nNeed we continue? The last 30 or so lots are mystery boxes of 150 7″ for between €125 and €250.\n\nCheck it out for yourself here and get down to Maison de la Radio HQ on 19th June for 2pm to get involved in person."
