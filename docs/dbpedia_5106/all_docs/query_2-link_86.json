        "text": "It looks like the French government has got some \"beef\" with plant-based meat labels.\n\nThey've recently issued a decree prohibiting the use of terms traditionally associated with meat, such as \"steak,\" on the labels of vegetarian products.\n\nOther terms like \"escalope,\" \"ham,\" \"filet,\" and \"prime rib\" can also no longer be used.\n\nThe decision comes in response to longstanding concerns raised by the meat industry regarding the potential confusion caused by terms like \"vegetarian ham\" or \"vegan sausage\" among consumers.\n\nThe decree, published on Tuesday (27 February), does however permit certain products containing a minimal amount of plant-based ingredients to retain the labels, including items like merguez sausage or cordon bleu.\n\nPenalties for violating the new labelling regulations range from fines of up to €1,500 for individuals to €7,500 for companies. However, producers are granted a one-year grace period to sell their existing stock before facing any penalties, as outlined in the decree."
