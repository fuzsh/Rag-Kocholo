        "text": "Radio Nova is French private radio station owned by Nova Press.\n\nThe station broadcasts non-mainstream or underground artists of various music genres, such as electro, new wave, reggae, jazz, hip hop and world music.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn 25 May 1981, Nova is created following the fusion of several radio stations. The radio is since its creation, owned by the Nova Press company, which today also owns the record label Nova Records, and the jazz-oriented radio station TSF Jazz.\n\nFrom 1985, Radio Nova is oriented mainly on world music, around 1988 the musical programming changes to only broadcast reggae, funk and rap.\n\nAround 1991, Nova changes its musical programming again, to acid jazz and French rap. In 1999, its musical programming consists of mainly the following genres, Ambient, chill-out and jungle.\n\nIn 1999, Nova Press bought the station jazz station TSF, which then becomes TSF 89,9 and installs its studios next to those of Radio Nova.\n\nThroughout its history, several well-known Parisians have had shows on Radio Nova, such as Ariel Wizman, Edouard Baer, Jamel Debbouze, Gilles Peterson, Ivan Smagghe, Laurent Garnier and David Guetta.\n\nIn September 2011, Nova and TSF Jazz quits the GIE of Les Indés Radios to commercialize national advertising via their own Nova Régie. Given a year's notice, it will be effective starting in September 2012.\n\nLogos[]\n\n1981-1993[]\n\n1993-2008[]\n\n2008-present[]\n\nClick for programming here"
