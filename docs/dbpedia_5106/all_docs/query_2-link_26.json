It works on all on all Checkpoint/Meto detection antennas and with this technology. It is sold in activated state, but can be deactivated.\n\nCustomization of the antitheft sticker\n\nUpon request, we offer the possibility of printing these labels with a logo, for example, for fixed information, but it is also possible to print variable information such as barcodes, price or serial numbers.\n\nWe have a wide range of radio frequency labels since we offer the standard size (40x40mm), but also a more compact size (31x32mm) that will be perfectly suitable for even the smallest objects without hiding any information. We also offer a larger format (50x50mm)."
