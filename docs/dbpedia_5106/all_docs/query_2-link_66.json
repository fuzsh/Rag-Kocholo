        "text": "Warner Chappell Music France, a music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, has announced a publishing administration agreement with Lofi Records, the label and publishing arm of the popular YouTube channel Lofi Girl.\n\nLofi Girl’s livestream lofi hip hop radio – beats to relax/study to is widely known for being the first 24/7 music livestream on YouTube. Launched in 2017, the stream features lofi hip hop music and the now-iconic Lofi Girl character studying, attracting millions of viewers worldwide.\n\nLofi Girlâs YouTube channel currently has 13.9 million subscribersÂ and around 30,000 to 60,000 simultaneous listeners. The character itself has become a pop culture icon, attracting a global community of fans. Lofi Girl has over 1.1 million followers on Instagram and more than 218,000 followers on X.\n\nThe popularity of the channel led to the creation of Lofi Records, which has been home to artists, instrumentalists and songwriters in the lofi hip-hop genre.Â\n\nIts success spurred the growth of countless other lofi channels. In 2021, Downtown Music Services signed five labels â the UKâs Homework Radio and Lofi Bloom, Germanyâs Effortless Audio, Canadaâs Inner Oceans Records, and Swedenâs NINETOFIVE â to its lofi roster.\n\nMeanwhile, the newly announced partnership sees Warner Chappell Music France administrating publishing rights for the majority of Lofi Records’ artists and seeking synchronization opportunities to expand their reach.\n\nLofi Girl recently released the music video Lofi Girl – Snowman, offering a glimpse into the character’s life and backstory. The video garnered over 1 million views within two weeks.\n\nâLofi Girl is a complete phenomenon and a world leader in this growing genre. The team have built a massive global community and are developing an impressive label full of talented artists from all over the world.”\n\nMatthieu Tessier, Warner Chappell Music France\n\nâLofi Girl is a complete phenomenon and a world leader in this growing genre. The team have built a massive global community and are developing an impressive label full of talented artists from all over the world. Weâre excited to start looking for new opportunities for fans to discover their music,â said Matthieu Tessier, Managing Director, Warner Chappell Music France.\n\nLofi Records’ artists include Late Night Tones, Brxvs, Odd Panda, KioKo, VIQ, Pierson Booth, Chau Sara, nyto, and producer LUQÄT.\n\nThe deal with Lofi Girl follows Warner Chappell Music Franceâs latest venture after it signed Mosaert, the independent label and publishing company founded by Belgian artist Stromae, in 2022. That same year, WCM France inked a sub-publishing deal with the estate of legendary Belgian singer-songwriter, actor and director Jacques Brel.\n\nMusic Business Worldwide"
