        "text": "With this year marking the 25th anniversary of Daft Punk's masterpiece 'Homework', I wanted to delve deeper into the early sound of Daft Punk, more specifically focusing on the catalogues of Roulé and Crydamoure Records, the labels run by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, and the house music that was spawned during the late '90s in Paris.\n\nRoulé (1995-2003) pretty much ran things in house music, releasing a stream of 12\"’s from Bangalter, his Paris friends, associates and various U.S. house legends. And then, after just 13 brilliant releases — 14 if you count one-off sub label Scratché — Roulé was gone, never to be heard from again.\n\nCrydamoure (1997-2003) was founded the same year Daft Punk released their debut album \"Homework\". The label's debut release came in the shape of \"Santa Claus\" and \"Holiday On Ice\" by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Eric Chedeville (label co-owner) themselves, under the name of Le Knight Club. Subsequently, artist Paul Johnson joined with \"White Winds\". As years followed, about 8 more artists joined, with the final release being a compilation album \"Waves II\", released in 2003. In total, Crydamoure released 30 records.\n\nEach label is reflective of both members' love for electronic dance music and its precursors disco and funk. Both however, are home to some of the greatest and innovative house music of the 90s - even of all time perhaps. Production masterclasses. Vibe originators. End of.\n\nUnfortunately, Spotify only covers a small fraction of the Roulé and Crydamoure catalogues, so I've also included songs from friends and family of Bangalter and Guy-Manuel, also released in the same era."
