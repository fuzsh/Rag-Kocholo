        "text": "The world's most popular dating app, Tinder, and Radio France's musical groups are joining forces to introduce the younger generation to classical music with an original operation designed by Ogilvy Paris.\n\nWith 34% of all classical music streamed worldwide in 2020 being streamed by 18-25-year-olds, this not-so-unexpected partnership between Tinder and La Maison de la Radio et de la Musique makes perfect sense when you consider that music is one of the most mentioned interests of Tinder members.\n\nBy applying a morphing technique usually used in the cinema, W.A Mozart, Piotr Tchaikovsky and Claude Debussy have been rejuvenated and rebranded to the codes of 2022 in order to create hyper credible profiles and make Tinder members want to engage in a conversation with them.\n\nWhen a Tinder member goes to swipe right on a composer's profile, they will receive a message in the app inviting them to go to the House of Radio and Music's Instagram account. People who comment on the Instagram post will be selected by Radio France to win classical music concert tickets with an exclusive backstage tour of the Radio France Auditorium. 100 people will also be offered a RADIO FRANCE CONCERTS YOUTH PASS to experience the unique symphony concert at the Radio France Auditorium over the 2022/2023 music season.\n\nBenjamin Puygrenier, Tinder spokesman in France said:\n\n\"Through this partnership, Radio France's musical groups and Tinder celebrate creativity but above all confirm their commitment to making classical music accessible and relevant to as many people as possible - especially young people, by allowing them to live together an incredible experience, around a musical genre considered elitist and closed.\"\n\nClaire Mariat, Head of Brand Influence Ogilvy Paris added:"
