For example, two radio group buttons for selecting a language (English or French):\n\nHow do you determine which radio button is selected using jQuery?\n\nThe Solution\n\nYou can use the jQuery selectors to find and select HTML elements by their attributes such as name, id, class, or type. The selectors all start with a dollar sign and parenthesis: $(). To get the value of the selected radio button you can use the following selectors and then get the value of the selected radio button using the val() method:\n\nThe attribute equals selector ([name=\"value\"]) is used to select elements with a type of “radio” and a name equal to “language”. The :checked selector matches all checked elements. The second argument of the jQuery selector is “#myForm”. The selectors only check for elements in the form with an id of “myForm”.\n\nYou could add a button to check which radio button is selected:\n\nYou can then add the following lines of code to check which radio button is selected by clicking the button:\n\nYou can also check which radio button is selected using vanilla JavaScript:"
