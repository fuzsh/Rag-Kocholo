The Air Swift bag was created using a substance that's 99% air and 1% a glasslike nanomaterial called silica aerogel, the same material NASA uses to collect cosmic dust. On social media, a commenter asked if the bag could actually hold things. Coperni responded, it could hold an iPhone.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nFADEL: It's MORNING EDITION.
