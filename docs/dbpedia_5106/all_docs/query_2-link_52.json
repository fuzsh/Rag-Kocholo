        "text": "In addition to fighting major label/distribution streaming income diversion away from Independent sound recording owners in the form of “breakage”, A2IM works to guarantee that our members are receiving equitable treatment in licensing deal structures. We work with important partners such as YouTube, Apple, Pandora, Spotify, and Microsoft to organize group meetings between our members and key personnel at these service providers to maximize promotion and monetize our member’s music.\n\nA2IM also works closely with SoundExchange to establish solutions addressing data and claims issues, including ensuring that royalty payouts are fairly attributed to the rightful owners. Our efforts include our presence on the SoundExchange Board and committees, data cleansing, more transparent search and claiming system, member education on SoundExchange programs, DMCA Notice/enforcement assistance, and proper attribution in repertoire disputes between Indies and majors. In 2014, A2IM also secured a sizable pro rata rebate of over $600,000, “the Advocacy adjustment,” from major labels on behalf of Independent labels.\n\nIndie Week is A2IM’s global spotlight event, bringing together 1000+ Independent music executives from the US and 25 countries (including Australia, Canada, France, Norway, China, and more). Indie Week is four days of industry panels, workshops, one-on-ones, networking events, and more.\n\nThe Libera Awards, the capstone on Indie Week, is A2IM’s annual award gala celebrating and honoring Independent milestones and extraordinary music. Complete with dinner, performances, networking after parties, this is the Independent community’s time to shine.\n\nSXSW Breakfast – our annual event in Austin that provides great networking opportunity for the A2IM member community where we organize Executive One-on-One Sessions between members.\n\nAttend official A2IM receptions at conferences throughout the year to network with fellow members at Music Biz (Nashville), Midem (Cannes), AmericanaFest (Nashville), Reeperbahn (Hamburg), ADE (Amsterdam), etc.\n\nGovernment Agency Filings: A2IM files with agencies such as the DOJ, FTC, and FCC to ensure equal licensing terms and access for Independents.\n\nCopyright Royalty Board (CRB): A2IM contributes to rate setting hearings to ensure fair and equitable rates for Independent labels and their artists\n\nAdvocacy on Capitol Hill: A2IM is a member of the Copyright Alliance and actively builds relationships with the White House, legislators on Capitol Hill and in State governments.\n\nU.S. Copyright Office: A2IM meets with the Register of Copyrights, and the Copyright Office’s General Counsel, files comments, and takes part in roundtable discussions on proposed changes to copyright law.\n\nCongressional Judiciary Committee Testimonies: A2IM represents the Independent community via testimonies and statements such as those made before the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, and the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet.\n\nPerformance Rights on Terrestrial Radio: A2IM is actively involved in seeking a U.S. performance right for sound recordings. Because of international reciprocity agreements, the lack of a Terrestrial Radio Right costs companies that do not have foreign domiciles, millions of dollars in lost revenue."
