About the game:

Double Dragon is a 1987 beat-em-up developed by Technos Japan. The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat-em-up, Renegade but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay (hence the title) and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs

Double Dragon was released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 on May 9, 2007. This version features an emulation of the original arcade game, as well as an optional game mode featuring redrawn high definition graphics and a remixed soundtrack. It also features support for online multiplayer. Double Dragon was removed from Xbox Live Arcade on July 1, 2009.

newbie question: is there any possible way to play the full version without the Jtag hack? I was wondering if I could put it on my HD using XSport 360 and then plug the HD back in the console...

or a way to put it on a DVD...?

The only way to play the full game is to purchase it on xbox live, i'm not sure if its possible with delisted games.
