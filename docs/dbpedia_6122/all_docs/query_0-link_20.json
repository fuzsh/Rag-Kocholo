        "text": "A few years back, I took at look at the NES classic River City Ransom. This comical 1989 beat-’em-up/RPG hybrid by Technōs Japan is a singular experience on the system and a favorite of many. Despite this, gamers outside Japan wouldn’t be treated to a direct sequel until River City: Tokyo Rumble arrived on the 3DS in 2016. Famicom owners got a much better deal. They only needed to wait two years for Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo Zen’in Shūgō! (“Downtown Special: It’s Kunio’s Period Piece, Assemble Everyone!”). As its mouthful of a title implies, this is the Kunio-kun franchise’s wacky take on a jidaigeki, or Japanese historical drama. If you’ve ever wondered how River City Ransom would have played out in the 17th century, here’s your chance to find out.\n\nI played the original Famicom version of Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki in conjunction with the unofficial English translation patch by Technōs Samurai Translation Project. There is another option in the form of the Double Dragon & Kunio-kun Retro Brawler Bundle, which went up for sale on the PlayStation 4 and Switch download services in February of this year. It includes official English versions of this and many other older Technōs games. Digital storefronts are notoriously fickle, so here’s hoping it’s still available by the time you read this.\n\nThere’s a plot going on in this one, although it’s mostly a paper thin excuse to dash around the countryside punching and kicking everyone you meet. Our tale begins with tough guy hero Kunio and his dorky brother responding to a request for aid from the head of the friendly Bunzō clan, who’s taken ill and requires a rare medicinal herb. The brothers set off to find it and this leads to betrayal, kidnapping, and other assorted intrigue courtesy of rival clans. While this clearly wasn’t a major focus and none of it stuck with me, I do appreciate that there’s a bit more in the way of ongoing storytelling here than there was in River City Ransom.\n\nThis game’s interpretation of ancient Japan comprises ten interconnected zones. Each is relatively compact, consisting of a dozen or so screens at most. There’s a lot more variety to these than we saw in River City’s various neighborhoods, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. Some are urban, others mountainous, icy, water filled, etc. This allows for a number of environmental conditions which can affect combat. Having to worry about falling into lava or getting pushed around by powerful river currents is an oddly welcome addition to the conventional brawling.\n\nAs for that brawling, it’s where Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki really shines. This will come as no surprise to lovers of the series, but it still bears mentioning because of how much its predecessor’s already impressive martial arts mayhem was refined and expanded upon. Kunio’s standard compliment of kicks, punches, throws, and ground attacks can be supplemented by up to 25 additional special techniques and a host of melee weapons. In short, you’re constantly gaining new ways to kick ass. Some of these special moves are pretty dang wild, too. I’m especially fond of the lethal fart that knocks down every enemy on the screen. If you’re looking for a game that pushes the console’s two-button controller to its limits, look no further.\n\nThe RPG mechanics underlying the fisticuffs have received an overhaul as well. Characters have the same set of ten statistics as before. These govern health, defense, how much damage they deal with specific attacks, and so on. Unlike in River City Ransom, stat growth isn’t predicated on purchasing food items in shops. Rather, it’s tied directly the experience points obtained from defeated enemies. This distinction is important, since the in-game menu lets you manually tweak what percentage of a character’s total earned experience is allocated to a given stat. If you’re in a hurry to boost your dude’s kick damage, for example, you can re-direct as many points as you wish from the other nine stats to make it happen. Most “serious” RPGs don’t even allow for this much fine-tuning of character progression. Oh, and the last game’s lengthy password saves have been replaced with a battery backup this time. Very cool.\n\nInasmuch as Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki lives up to its billing as an enhanced River City Ransom in period garb, I can’t say enough good things about it. Regrettably, however, a few of its stabs at innovation turned out to be mixed blessings at best. The biggest offender has to be the partner system. Remember how I mentioned that Kunio was accompanied on the journey by his brother? Well, that’s not just for story purposes. If you’re playing alone, you’ll have a computer-controlled ally fighting alongside you at all times, whether you like it or not. You’ll recruit a whole stable of them over the course of the adventure, in fact, and can switch them out as desired back at your home base. What sounds like a very neat mechanic is ultimately more of a pain than anything. Your “helpers” are as dumb as can be, continually swooping in at the least opportune moments to get in your way, pelt you with objects, and steal your hard-earned cash drops. There’s no way to ditch them, either. Believe me, I tried. Let the bad guys kill them off and they’ll simply reappear after the next screen transition. If a second player is present, he or she will control the other character, which naturally works out much better. This arguably makes Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki more fun than River City Ransom for two players and less so for one. An option to fight solo and devote the extra system memory to enabling a third enemy on screen instead would have been amazing. Alas.\n\nSlowdown is another sore point. The action slows to crawl on a fairly regular basis. The prevalence of this seems to be at least partly dependent on your location in the game world. One area in particular has a very attractive orange sunset in the background and virtually every fight that takes place in it runs at around 50% speed. This is where I ended up facing off against the game’s two final bosses and the choppy nature of the exchange greatly undermined what should have been a satisfying climax.\n\nThough these are significant, pervasive flaws, I wouldn’t go so far as to call them fatal ones. Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki largely succeeds at its mission to deepen both the beat-’em-up and RPG aspects of River City Ransom. It also stays true to the goofy tone the saga is so beloved for. Seeing Kunio, Riki, and the rest of these familiar characters transported into an entirely new setting is a treat for fans like myself. I even spotted a couple of the team captains from Super Dodge Ball rounding out the cast. This is a quality work and certainly deserved better than to be condemned to obscurity in the West over some old-timey Japanese set dressing. Barf!\n\nI can’t believe it’s taken me this long to fire up Gunstar Heroes. Granted, I never owned Sega systems growing up and have only been seriously exploring their libraries for the past three years or so. Still, this frenetic side-scrolling run-and-gun has been a mainstay on virtually every “best of the Genesis” list drafted since its release. In addition to being a masterpiece in its own right, it led to a long string of further cult classics by the developers at Treasure. After all, it was the management at Konami’s refusal to greenlight Gunstar Heroes which prompted the small team there who would become Treasure to strike out on their own in the first place. Thankfully, the project eventually attained the backing of no less than Sega themselves, who published it in 1993.\n\nAny gaming history buff would be hard pressed to cite a more confident debut effort. Giving free reign to a group who’d previously worked on the likes of Contra III: The Alien Wars and Super Castlevania IV resulted in an explosion of unbridled creativity with plenty of experience and discipline to back it up. Gunstar Heroes is the rare action game that’s all things to all players: Approachable by those of practically any skill level, simple to pick up yet nuanced enough to reward repeat playthroughs, badass and cute. It’s no exaggeration to say Treasure set a new high water mark for an entire genre here.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. The plot of Gunstar Heroes involves a group of elite warriors, the Gunstars, who once saved the planet from a rampaging super robot known as Golden Silver. Unable to destroy Golden Silver permanently, they took the four gems that powered it and hid them throughout the world, leaving the robot’s inert body sealed away on the moon. Years later, an evil empire has set out to gather the gems and revive Golden Silver. These villains have also managed to brainwash one of the Gunstars, Green, to use a pawn against his former comrades. It now falls on the Gunstar twins, Red and Blue, to stave off Armageddon once more with the support of their sister, Yellow, and scientist mentor, Dr. Brown. Why is everyone in this world named after colors? Beats me.\n\nOne or both of the twins (depending on whether you’re utilizing the two-player simultaneous mode) will need to blast through seven stages to overthrow the Empire. The first four can be taken in any order you wish, while the final three function as an extended linear finale that sees the Gunstars pursuing the baddies into space. The levels themselves are a healthy mix of traditional run-and-gun platforming and more experimental fare. One of the latter is an auto-scroller where you speed through a series of underground tunnels on a moving platform that can alternate between clinging to the floor or ceiling as needed in a manner reminiscent of the gravity flip mechanic from Irem’s Metal Storm. Another is structured like a board game. Tossing a die on each of your turns moves you a random number of spaces toward the end boss, with each space along the way representing a different mini-boss or opportunity to score some healing and weapon power-ups. The only dud in the bunch is stage six, which is presented as a spaceship shooter with eight-directional movement. It’s far from a great one, however, and drags on far too long. Gradius or Thunder Force this is not.\n\nComplimenting a largely fantastic crop of levels is one of the more interesting weapon systems in any game of the era. At the outset, you’re prompted to select your default shot from a total of four: Force is the typical machine gun type with average power, Lightning is the deadly but slow-firing laser, Chaser is the homing shot with reduced damage, and Fire is the short range, high power option. Fortunately for those of us who hate hard choices, this only affects which one you start the game with. The other three are still obtainable via colored icons scattered throughout the stages.\n\nFour guns based on common shooter archetypes doesn’t seem too impressive…until you begin experimenting with their various combinations. See, you can carry two guns at a time. Swapping between them is possible, but the more interesting option is usually to equip both at once! Want a homing flame shot? Try Chaser with Fire. Machine gun laser? Force and Lightning. You can even combine a weapon with a duplicate of itself to get an enhanced version of its standard shot. If you don’t feel like doing the math yourself, that’s sixteen additional guns to play around with. They’re all effective in their own ways, too. There’s no need to worry about screwing yourself over by picking up the “wrong” weapon.\n\nAnd there’s more! The Gunstars come with their own repertoire of hand-to-hand combat moves. They can grab and toss foes, block attacks, deliver sliding kicks and flying tackles, you name it. It all makes for one mind-boggling arsenal. The sheer number of meaningful choices open to you from moment to moment is exhilarating.\n\nBoss battles in Treasure games are the stuff of legend. Gunstar Heroes is where that legend took root. Here they began to popularized their signature technique of using multiple small sprites moving in unison to convey the impressive of one massive enemy with silky smooth animation. There are over two dozen of these guys to take down and no two behave remotely alike. Many have multiple distinct phases or forms for you to deal with. The most famous by far (and rightfully so) is Seven Force, the transforming robot piloted by Gunstar Green. True to its name, it can assume seven distinct forms over the course of one marathon battle. My sole regret when it comes to the Seven Force fight is that it happens relatively early on. They should have saved such a tour de force for the final act. It’s no coincidence that the most memorable opponent in Treasure’s later Mega Drive release Alien Soldier was a similar shapeshifting menace called Valkyrie Force.\n\nPerhaps my very favorite part of this formidable package is just how approachable it all is. Gunstar Heroes forsakes the arcade roots of Contra and other pioneering run-and-gun titles by giving its protagonists rather generous health pools to rely on in place of the more common one-hit kills. Factor in the unlimited continues and difficulty modes ranging from Easy to Expert and you have yourself a game that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. As much as I adore Contra, its unforgiving nature means I need to occupy a certain highly focused headspace to get the most out of it. Not so with the casual-friendly Gunstar Heroes. I can throw it on whenever and have a grand time.\n\nIs there anything about it I would change? Well, I already mentioned the mediocre space shooting section. There’s also one slightly disappointing facet of the game’s otherwise flawless control scheme. Whenever you start a new session, you’re required to pick between a free shooting style that lets you literally run and gun and a fixed one that locks you in place while firing, allowing you to better deliver sustained damage to enemy weak points. Ideally, of course, you would be able to toggle between these two settings on the fly. You’re able to do so in the 16-bit Contra games as well as the aforementioned Alien Soldier. As presented here, though, it’s a one time exclusive choice. Bummer.\n\nApart from that, Gunstar Heroes is a bona fide game for the ages. An interactive master class in 2-D action design, it proved to the world at large that the name Treasure was no idle boast. It’s packed with lighthearted charm, slick visuals, and one of the finest soundtracks ever composed for the system. Is it the best run-and-gun on the Genesis? That’s a toughie. If I were somehow forced to pick one and only one to play for the rest of my life, the shorter, more intense Contra: Hard Corps would probably win out. Barely. Good thing I don’t foresee that happening. So if you’re like me and have been dragging your feet on this one, consider fixing that soon.\n\nIs it just me or does Wily look like he might be enjoying that? Awkward.\n\nMega Man 6 made its Japanese debut in November of 1993, a mere month before the franchise’s shiny new spinoff, Mega Man X, hit the Super Famicom. We North Americans didn’t get a crack at it until March of 1994, two months after our version of X. Talk about late to the party! Seemingly content with being yet another slight twist on the formula established by the first two NES Mega Man entries, it was destined for a minute fraction of the critical acclaim and commercial success its more innovative 16-bit cousin enjoyed. It’s long been regarded as the one of the most redundant of Mega Man’s many sequels. Even more so than the fourth and fifth games, if that’s possible.\n\nLike all the main line titles after the fourth, I missed out on this one back around the time of its release. That’s a shame, because while I do understand the audience burnout six highly similar games in seven years can engender, I had a blast with Mega Man 6. It’s an improvement on the lackluster 5 in virtually every way and at times comes close to rivaling 2 and 4, my personal favorites of the NES hexalogy.\n\nThe evil Dr. Wily is back and he’s brought another eight robot masters for you to take down and gain new weaponry from. There is some pretext of a new story, of course: A fellow named Mr. X who runs an international robot fighting tournament has seized control of its contestants in a bid to take over the world. Oh, and he just happens to look exactly like Wily wearing shades and a vampire cape. This setup is so transparent and hokey that I honestly can’t tell if the developers didn’t give a damn anymore or if they were aiming for self-parody. I suppose I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the latter.\n\nFlimsy as the Mr. X conceit is, it does allow for some interesting new boss and level theming. Each robot master is associated with a particular region of the world this time. Knight Man calls a European castle home, for example, and Blizzard Man hails from snowy Canada. A couple of these characterizations are less than flattering. Ersatz Native American Tomahawk Man comes to mind. Regardless, his Wild West stage (complete with dramatic sunset and six-shooter packing cowboy bots) is a memorable one. My favorite of the bunch in terms of visual design is Centaur Man, the first non-humanoid robot master.\n\nNot only are these bosses a striking lot, the special weapons Mega Man earns from them are quite useful. Although they’re nothing we haven’t seen before by this point, they cover the usual bases well. You have the rotating shield, costly full screen attack, ascending and descending shots to compliment the straight ahead Mega Buster, etc. They’re relatively balanced this time, too. You won’t find anything as overwhelming as Mega Man 2’s Metal Blade here, but neither will you be forced to make due with hot garbage like Mega Man 5’s Charge Kick or Power Stone.\n\nBeat the bird also makes his return. As before, you’ll need to collect an assortment of letter icons (four this time) in order to unlock him. Finding these letters requires the odd measure of locating hidden alternate routes to the robot masters’ rooms and defeating them there rather than in their regular digs. Unfortunately, Beat has been greatly toned-down from the cutesy superweapon he was in the last game, so this involved process isn’t ultimately worth it in my book. One hidden gadget you will want to acquire is the Energy Balancer. Found in a well hidden room, this sucker automatically distributes weapon energy pickups to inactive items in your inventory, ensuring you never waste an ammo drop again. Truly a godsend.\n\nEquipment-wise, however, the real MVPs are the two Rush Adaptors. As their name implies, these are a new take on Mega Man’s helpful canine companion, Rush. Instead of manifesting as various helpful utility items like the Rush Jet or Rush Coil, he now merges directly with Mega Man’s body, resulting in two additional forms for our hero with their own innate advantages. The Power Adaptor adds a chargeable punch attack that deals heavy damage and can smash through some walls to reveal goodies and pathways. Better still is the spectacular Jet Adaptor, which allows Mega Man to fly at will, albeit for no more than a few seconds at a time. Minor as that sounds, this added freedom of movement totally alters the feel of the game. Once I gained access to it via defeating Plant Man, I never wanted to take it off. No wonder it features so prominently in the game’s cover art!\n\nAs I said, this one really surprised me. I was fully expecting it to come across as tired and perfunctory as Mega Man 5 did. What I actually got was one of the more creative takes on the classic series. It’s certainly not perfect. The plot is daft and veterans may well find it a tad too easy for it own good. It’s neither as iconic as the second installment nor as fine-tuned as the fourth. Despite this, the new enemies and settings are packed with personality, while the Rush Adaptors offer fresh takes on controlling the Blue Bomber himself. Factor in Capcom’s generally high audiovisual standards and the proven strength of the core Mega Man gameplay loop and you have a winner on your hands; one that deserves far more recognition than it gets. Mega Man 6 serves as a worthy capstone to its legendary star’s exploits on the platform of his birth.\n\nStop me if you’ve heard this one: A blue-haired lass with the unlikely name of Princess Prin Prin has been kidnapped by demons. Only her knightly consort, Sir Arthur, is brave (or foolhardy) enough to attempt a rescue…and he’ll need to do it twice before it sticks.\n\nYes, welcome back to Capcom’s Ghosts ‘n Goblins, perhaps the most simultaneously loved and hated saga in all of classic gaming. The sterling quality of these games is undeniable, as is their mocking brutality. Difficult action-platformers from the outset due to fiendish enemy patterns and a two-hit health system, it’s dirty tricks like the aforementioned blindsiding of new players with the requirement to finish each stage twice in order to view the true ending that push them over the edge to infamy.\n\nThat brings me to my subject today, 1991’s Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, aka Chōmakaimura (“Super Demon World Village”) in Japan. As the third game in the franchise and the first to be developed with a home console in mind, as opposed to the arcades, players at the time may have expected Capcom to mellow out a tad with this one. Nope. If anything, they doubled down on the sadism with longer levels and something no home port of the previous two GnG games had: Limited continues. The result was far and away the most challenging installment to date. Good thing it was also the best.\n\nI realize I’m likely to ruffle a few feathers with that last statement. Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts’ immediate predecessor, titled simply Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, is quite excellent in its own right. It introduced a golden armor power-up that let Arthur charge up and release a different magic attack for each of the game’s many weapons. Additionally, Ghouls ‘n Ghosts Arthur was able to lob shots up and down in addition to the usual left and right. There are many who swear by this enhanced shooting and consequently consider Ghouls ‘n Ghosts the best of the lot.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts returns to the more restrictive horizontal attacking of the original Ghosts ‘n Goblins, I feel it more than makes up for this with new additions of its own. The bronze armor has been included as an intermediate upgrade between the default steel suit and the potent gold one. It strengthens Arthur’s primary weapon somewhat without allowing for full magic use. There’s also a shield which offers some small amount of extra protection against projectiles. Best of all is the almighty double jump, my personal favorite mechanic in the series. The ability to trigger a second jump any point during the first works wonders for the chronically slow Arthur’s maneuverability and paved the way for the game’s creators to include more elaborate platforming scenarios. It feels so liberating that I often find it tough to go back to earlier GnG entries.\n\nAnother factor that endears Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts to me is its level design. Capcom really upped the ante here with a host of dynamic environmental set pieces scattered throughout the first five areas. Arthur weathers surging tidal waves on a dinky raft, rides a fleshy moving platform through a maze of writhing, gas spewing innards, and risks being swept away by avalanches in the obligatory ice level, among other wild predicaments. Pity this approach is abandoned for the final two stages inside main villain Sardius’ castle, though. These contain nothing new or interesting to marvel at, just an abundance of imposing baddies coupled with some strict time limits.\n\nCap this overall strong package off with some of the best graphics and music to grace an early Super Nintendo release and what’s not to love? For starters, try some of the worst slowdown to grace an early Super Nintendo release! The action here starts chugging at the slightest provocation, a significant issue in a unforgiving game with a heavy emphasis on timing. This effectively adds another learning curve to an already demanding experience. There is a fan-made “restoration” hack available that removes much of this slowdown if you’re so inclined. Otherwise, your best bet is to simply wait for your brain to adjust to the inevitable speed inconsistencies. It’ll happen eventually.\n\nA lone technical hiccup is one thing, but those limited continues constitute a proper design misstep in my eyes. There’s an immense amount of trial and error involved in any Ghosts ‘n Goblins game. The endless tries previous ones afforded you were essentially their lone concession to basic human decency. Earning extra continues by collecting money bag items is possible and indeed relatively easy in some stages. Still, the game as a whole can come to a premature end if the rate you gather these items is ever exceeded by the rate you mess up. This is most likely in the final stage, which is cunningly engineered to contain a bare minimum of money bags. Getting a game over here, especially in the second loop, is cruel even by GnG standards.\n\nMaddening as these few flaws can be, Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts’ many positive qualities far outstrip them. It’s considered a Capcom classic for good reason and if its reputation as a savage 16-bit struggle doesn’t scare you off, you’re in for one lush, thrilling trip to hell and back. If not, well, there are probably dozens of more easily rescued princesses out there. Sorry, Prin Prin. I’m just sayin’.\n\nAre video games art?\n\nIt’s a question that’s been bandied about for decades now. Late film critic Roger Ebert famously disputed the notion, stating in a 2007 online debate with writer Clive Barker: “I believe art is created by an artist. If you change it, you become the artist…Art seeks to lead you to an inevitable conclusion, not a smorgasbord of choices.” Ebert’s position is easy to dismiss as the product of contrarianism or outmoded sensibilities. It does make a certain degree of sense in light of the unilateral nature of a non-interactive medium like film, however. Consider a production like 1980’s The Shining. Master cinematographer John Alcott’s eerie, claustrophobic framing of the Overlook Hotel elevates a series of otherwise ordinary sets and exteriors into what feels like a proper character deserving of top billing alongside Nicholson and Duvall. If we were to somehow grant each and every viewer of The Shining the ability to pan and zoom the cameras in real time, Alcott’s award-winning art would be obliterated in an instant.\n\nAs for me, I’d always been a “rose by any other name” sort with little stake in the controversy. Whatever they are, video games have been a source of fascination and joy for me for as long I can remember. Surely that’s enough? This all changed recently when I encountered one singularly rich and challenging work.\n\nPublished exclusively in Japan by Media Ring Corporation, 1992’s Toilet Kids for the PC Engine appears thoroughly unexceptional at first glance. A basic vertical shooter that takes heavy cues from Namco’s Xevious, some have gone so far as to call it a crude, low-effort clone of a nearly decade-old classic. Well, what if I told you that Toilet Kids, despite being one of the worst-reviewed PC Engine releases, is actually a complex, uplifting synthesis of psychology, philosophy, and mysticism?\n\nToilet Kids is ostensibly the story of a small boy (and his girl counterpart in the two-player simultaneous mode), who finds himself sucked down the loo during a late night bathroom run. He’s then compelled to pilot a flying toilet in hopes of liberating a magical land from a motley array of feces flinging opponents. Disembodied penises spray urine, hippos emerge from the rivers to belch caustic clouds, and reindeer fire triple spread volleys of poo pellets. Our hero’s only defenses over the game’s four notably short stages are a charge shot effective against airborne foes and short range bombs for the grounded ones.\n\nWith a premise like this, it’s plain to see why Toilet Kids has long been dismissed as so much juvenile schlock. Predictably, there are few, if any, who have undertaken any real analysis to determine why the game’s creators seized on such scatological subject matter in the first place. This is an oversight I intend to correct here and now.\n\nTo begin with, the choice of a young child as protagonist is, in this context, an obvious allusion to Sigmund Freud’s theory of psychosexual development. Freud described this as a five stage process beginning in early childhood. Each stage culminates in a conflict of sorts, the successful resolution of which contributes to the formation of a healthy personality. Conversely, failure to cleanly resolve a psychosexual conflict can result in neurosis. In particular, I direct your attention to the anal stage, the second of Freud’s five. The conflict here is toilet training itself. A child able to balance the instinctual eliminatory demands of the body with parental and societal expectations of self-control is primed to become a confident and productive adult. Trauma at this stage gives rise to so-called anal-expulsive and anal-retentive types instead.\n\nFreud’s various theories have, of course, been widely challenged. Regardless, his was one of the most influential minds of both the 19th and 20th centuries. Even people unacquainted with formal psychoanalysis are familiar with terms and concepts like the id, ego, Oedipus complex, Freudian slip, and so on. The central narrative of Toilet Kids dovetails too neatly with the Freudian line for it to be mere coincidence.\n\nHaving now identified Toilet Kids’ central theme as the nascent personality’s struggle for self-realization, an enigma still remains: Why focus on the anal stage? What’s so important about bodily waste that the developers saw fit to literally plaster almost every screen of the game with it? To answer this, I need to shift gears from modern Western psychology to ancient Eastern philosophy. Specifically, to Taoism. This Chinese school of thought is predicated on the existence of the Tao, or Way, a sort of intangible natural order that shapes and directs the manifest universe. By studying the Tao and conducting his or her life in harmony with its operations, the practitioner can achieve enlightenment. Because it is effectively omnipresent, Taoist writers make a point of emphasizing that the Tao dwells even in objects and places shunned by most people. Take this except from Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu, as translated by Burton Watson:\n\n“Master Tung-kuo asked Chuang Tzu, ‘This thing called the Way – where does it exist?’\n\nChuang Tzu said, ‘There’s no place it doesn’t exist.’\n\n‘Come,’ said Master Tung-kuo, ‘you must be more specific!’\n\n‘It is in the ant.’\n\n‘As low a thing as that?’\n\n‘It is in the panic grass.’\n\n‘But that’s lower still!’\n\n‘It is in the tiles and shards.’\n\n‘How can it be so low?’\n\n‘It is in the piss and shit.'”\n\nThis identification of the Tao, the most revered divine power, with the discarded and reviled has direct parallels in another esoteric discipline of old: Alchemy. Though the practice is nowadays typically associated only with the fabled conversion of lead into gold, the medieval alchemist believed that all matter was endowed with a spiritual spark and contained within itself the seed of its own perfection. The most storied example of the alchemical process is no doubt the philosophers’ stone, a miraculous substance which could, among countless other things, cure any disease and confer immortality. The creation of the stone was a years-long endeavor beginning with the selection of the correct prima materia (“first matter”). In the ultimate expression of the transformative principal mentioned above, this raw material was rumored to be a lowly, commonplace thing. I think you see where this is headed. Yes, the alchemists would often begin their experiments with flasks of urine or dung. Perhaps they reasoned that something so viscerally disagreeable held the most room for improvement and thus the final product would be all the more sublime for it.\n\nHaving now reached the conclusion of this exercise, I feel I’ve arrived at a reasonably complete picture of Toilet Kids as an artistic statement. Its young hero’s journey is an archetypal psychodrama of becoming as told through the metaphor of a bare bones PCE shooting game. His triumph over the enemy’s excremental onslaught represents nothing less than the alchemic transmution of his own base elements into something altogether more rarified, in accordance with the most subtle yet powerful of universal laws.\n\nThe dictionary defines art as “the quality, production, expression, or realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance.” While Toilet Kids may not rate as beautiful or appealing for most of you, I trust you’ll now agree that its significance is anything but ordinary.\n\n…\n\nApril fools! This game is shit, y’all."
