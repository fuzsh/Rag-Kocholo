        "text": "announced that will allow players to see a revival of the classic beat’em up series in full 3D. And as if that wasn’t enough, it’s coming from the same hands that have developed some of the finest fighting games of the past generation.\n\nTitled Double Dragon Revive (via Video Games Chronicle), the new game is being developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind the recent Guilty Gear Strive, Dragon Ball FighterZ, the BlazBlue series and many games more. This is not exactly a remake of the original title, but instead a reimagining of the franchise with deeply detailed 3D graphics like only Arc System Works knows how to do.\n\nOf course, for fans of the studio this shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, as they acquired the rights to Double Dragon (and the Kunio-Kun series of River City Ransom fame) directly from Technos Japan Corp quite a few years ago, back in 2015. Ever since then, several new games in the franchise have been released, and although they typically involved revamped graphical styles, it’s never been such a change as this.\n\nArc System Works has become one of the biggest names in the fighting game community for their many titles in the genre, including the aforementioned Guilty Gear series, BlazBlue, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and more recently their work on Granblue Fantasy Versus. Their amazing “2D anime” graphics have always been part of their main appeal, although in reality this has always been achieved through highly stylized 3D animations and excelent camera work and direction.\n\nThere are still not many details about Double Dragon Revive, but it’s apparently planned to release at some point in 2025, available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC."
