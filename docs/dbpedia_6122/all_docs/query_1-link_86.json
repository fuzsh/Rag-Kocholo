Do yall think a chance of revival for the father of fighting games is possible , and if so what series do you want to return?\n\ncurrently playin\n\nHot Blooded Family, Streets Of rage 1-3, Golden Axe 1-3, Tokyo Beat Down, Final Fight Double impact:blush:\n\nWouldn’t really call beat 'em ups the father of fighting games since both developed separately at around the same time.\n\nThat said, wouldn’t mind seeing more beat 'em ups played online outside of Castle Crashers and Final Fight: DI.\n\nI hear that competitive fighting as it is known today started out as essentially a ‘bonus’ mode added in by Capcom in SF2. I know there was a Vs. mode in SF1 but that’s not really comparable.\n\nCapcom thought that SF2 was going to be essentially a single player game where the extent of competitive play was going to be shooting for the high score, but with a 1v1 mode as an optional side attraction.\n\nIn fact, that attitude is probably confirmed by the apparent fact that Final Fight was supposed to be Street Fighter 2 to begin with, and as we all know, that is purely a single player/co-op game and not in any description a competitive 1v1 fighter.\n\nWell, technically, FF was suppsoed to be a spin off named Street Fighter '89.\n\nI’ve been thinking of making a thread about beat’em ups.\n\nAny chance we could get the Punisher arcade game on PSN with GGPO? With MvC3 on the horizon, it may be possible to port this over to PSN and XBL.\n\nI used to play it a lot as a kid with my bro at the arcade ;.;\n\nWhat other 90s beat em ups can be put on PSN and XBL BTW?\n\nStreets of Rage 1-2 (Fuck 3)\n\nSengoku 3\n\nGolden Axe II\n\nD&D\n\nFF2\n\nThat’s pretty much it.\n\nI’d love to see some of Capcom’s classics (D&D games, CapCom, AvP, Battle Circuit, etc.) and some of Konami’s as well (Simpsons).\n\nAnyone remember a game called Brawl Brothers? Hella fun. Sure wish my friend didn’t move away with my SNES cart though…\n\nX-Men the arcade game and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:Turtles in time please!\n\ndouble dragon 2 nes b-mode\n\nRushing Beat\n\nThe Rushing Beat series, known as Brawl Brothers in America. They were fun, I still play them on SNES roms. There were 3 of them. Made by Jaleco. They were descent fighters, basic final fight rip offs with a few different aspects. The 3rd one called peace walkers in America was the best. Jaleco also attemped to copy STF2 with there fighter \\Dead Dance. It was kinda cool cz you could level up your moves as you progressed. It also had the first replay at the end of a match, so you could watch the last few seconds of kicking your buddys ass , over,and over again.:china:\n\nI recently have been searching for more rare Beat em ups. I found one on the PC Engine called “Crest of Wolf”. It wasn’t bad and the Music was tight. Check it out if you guys get a chance.:wgrin:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions around is that beat-em-ups begat fighters. If anything, the opposite is true since arguably the first fighter (Karate Champ / Karate Dou) came out before the first belt-scrolling beat-em-up (Renegade / Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun).\n\nThe Rushing Beat series is competent but the watered down US versions are disappointing. Dead Dance was released in the US as Tuff E Nuff with horrible box art to boot. Crest of Wolf was released in the US as Riot Zone, a pretty easy $10 find. It’s not bad but nothing really stands out either.\n\nThe belt-scrolling genre isn’t doing so well but it also isn’t entirely dead since IGS has been consistently putting them out for years (Oriental Legend 2 in 2008, Knights of Valour 2 New Legend in 2009, the 3rd KOV maybe this year or the next). I’ve personally held out hope for a new Streets of Rage / Bare Knuckle game for a long time but sadly, it seems the majority have moved on to 3D action without looking back.\n\nOh damn I didn’t even know they came out with a sequel. Time to get to emulatin’!\n\nguess i’m not the only one who preferred the NES games to the arcade versions.\n\nI Remember people waiting in line and watching over someone completing single player mode in WW at my local arcade back when it came out.\n\nI love beat’em ups too, some of my faves:\n\nBattl;e Circuit (CPS2)\n\nUndercover Cops (Arcade, SFC)\n\nBare Knuckle 3 (Genesis/Megadrive)\n\nDouble Dragon 2 (NES and PCE)\n\nSuper Double Dragon (SNES) heavely underrated IMO\n\nFinal Fight 3 (SNES)\n\nGolden Axe 2 - Revenge of Death Adder (Arcade) completely different game than the Genesis game\n\nDynamite Denka, aka DIE HARD ARCADE, with an option to actually use BRUCE WILLIS, with bloody feet.\n\nYippee kay aye, mudda funster\n\nI actually think the 3d ones are a bit more interesting because they’re like fighters with a campaign. I usually like the 2d ones for their presentation, like Castle Crashers.\n\ntwo words: DOUBLE DRAGON !!\n\nYeah!! Dd!!!\n\nMAn, Double Dragon 2 was my favorite!!! I need that game again Gotta check my Roms!!!\n\n2d beat em ups are the shit!!:wgrin: 3d ones are just too slow for me I guess. Also im big into hand drawn art and a lot of design is lost on crappy polygons :shake:Do you guys know any other rare 2d beat em ups?"
