        "text": "NES - The detail level is actually quite nice. The texture work is consistently good (check the road in the first screen shot, it has the main part of the road, with the sidewalk, and sewer gratings both apparent) little elements like signs and posters have been included, and often there are detailed far backgrounds visible (cityscapes, mountains etc).\n\nMaster System - The detail level is fairly good, but definitely not on par with the NES version. The scale looks to be wrong (there's an appearance of walking through a giant environment), and quite a few liberties have been taken with the graphics (notice in the first screen shot instead of drawing in the original layered background the programmers just increased the height of the wall to block out the far distance). The texture work is decent, but not as good as in the NES version. There's also fewer small details in the graphics here (less posters, signs, windows, bins etc). The sprites are definitely a little bit more detailed here though compared to NES (and coloured far better, though more on that later).\n\nC64 - Its not actually that bad. Apart from the tiny, badly drawn sprite (who looks like Rick James for some reason), a fair amount of effort has been made to represent all the main visual elements of the arcade version. Detail isn't that high (there's not many little details like posters etc) and the textures could be better, but overall this version still looks decent.\n\nAmstrad - A pretty good attempt has been made to add some detail to the graphics, with posters, broken fences etc included, and everything textured reasonably well. It looks a little blocky, but for the Amstrad's low resolution colour mode this isn't bad at all, the character sprites are also a better size than in the other versions (except spectrum).\n\nSpectrum - Detail wise its still roughly on par with the other computer ports, but the Spectrum could've done a lot better than this, with its high resolution more elements like door signs, windows, posters and the like could've easily been included. I also dislike the floor textures as I don't think they convey the source material very well (just compare the weird looking blue road texture on the first screen shot to the NES version which is actually properly drawn as a road and pavement). The main character here is also a good size, though he looks strangely like a skeleton wearing a wig.\n\nDouble Dragon was one of the seminal beat-em-up games of its time. The game has you walking from left to right beating up thugs, with the occasional platforming gameplay thrown in (jumping on boxes or over gaps, climbing ladders or fences, dodging background dangers). The most interesting element though was the level of interactivity with the environments and characters, enemies could be beaten down and their weapons picked up and used against them, well placed attacks could send the thugs falling down holes or onto conveyers which would drag them off the side of the screen to their deaths.\n\nNES - For the most part the gameplay of the arcade original is represented fairly well (the combos work well, there are ladders to climb and opportunities to knock the enemies down holes), but a number of changes have been made.\n\nInstead of giving you all the moves available from the beginning the NES version of Double Dragon includes a new experience system where at the beginning you can only do the basic punch and kick moves, but as you defeat enemies you gain experience, and when enough experience is gained new moves are awarded. The new system isn't solely about making you work for your average arcade moves though, after you pass a certain level of experience you start to get new moves which have been created for this port, the new moves include the \"Punch them when they're down\" action from the original Renegade arcade game, and an overly elaborate combo where you finish by jumping up into the air for a final kick (this move can on occasion allow the enemies to counter-attack though). The experience system works fairly well and helps to keep the game interesting as you make your way through the levels.\n\nApart from the experience system there is one other major difference to the NES version, Levels 3, and 4 have had many new sections added to them to increase the game's longevity, these new sections are actually pretty good, and contain much more platformer orientated sections (one part has you jumping along moving platforms).\n\nThis version has a few bad points though, there's only ever two enemies on screen at once, the pacing is noticeably slower, and most damaging of all is the unfortunate lack of the two player option, which is a real shame.\n\nMaster System - This version is extremely simplified in comparison to the arcade version, the ladders, fences, and conveyer belts are all absent, and the element of throwing the enemies down holes etc, is very much downplayed.\n\nThe controls and hit detection in this version are dodgy, and not up to the standards of the NES port, the biggest damage in this area is based around the hair grab move, which is extremely temperamental to the stage that its no longer worth using. Due to the simplified gameplay this port is mainly just based around walking forwards and punching the enemies, then moving on and repeating until the end.\n\nThe last criticism I have is the continue system, in this version you are actually awarded unlimited continues until the final stage which you have to complete with just one, this system means that you literally don't need to put any effort in until the last stage, no matter how well you play for the first three levels it will have no effect on your chances to complete the game.\n\nOnto the good points, this version is fairly fast and smooth, it has more enemies onscreen than the NES version, and, most importantly includes the two player option. Having another player along for the ride does help to lessen the repetitiveness of the experience, but unfortunately overall the gameplay still feels at lot less polished than the NES port.\n\nC64 - The gameplay in this version is atrocious. Most importantly half the moveset is missing (you can't even do a flying kick let alone a throw or hair grab!) and the stages are very empty (often only one enemy on screen). This version is pretty easy, even though punching and kicking here do not combo, you basically have to kick each enemy, then retreat, then kick, then retreat etc (which is extremely time consuming, not to mention boring). There is a two player option, but I wouldn't fancy anyone's chances of actually getting someone else to play this with them on 2-player.\n\nAmstrad - Again, the gameplay here is similarly awful, its actually ridiculously slow (and I mean ridiculously slow, its like you're moving in slow motion through the entire game), and very, very easy, the enemies take ages to kill but put up very little fight, making this version even more boring than the C64 version.\n\nOn top of the previous problems, this port also has cut down levels with sections such as the moving rocks from the final level missing. There is a two player option, but it does little to save the game.\n\nSpectrum - This version is slightly better than the other two computer ports but is still very, very bad. Its slightly smoother and easier to do the moves but the enemies are far more aggressive and beat you down over and over, they punch you back consistently while you're attacking them, and, even worse can not only punch you when they're not lined up (which you can't do) but are actually programmed to purposefully move up to a position where they should be missing and pummel you without you being able to hit back (at which point you maneuver to hit them and they move again and go back to punching!!). These elements come together to make the Spectrum version extremely frustrating to play."
