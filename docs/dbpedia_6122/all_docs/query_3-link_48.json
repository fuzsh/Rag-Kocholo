Even a stonkingly good Jeroen Tel title track, doesn't excuse that.\n\nThe game itself is completely unplayable, but some minor entertainment can be gleaned by trying to unearth the game's myriad bugs.\n\nPut simply, this is one of the worst games in the history of electronic entertainment. And possibly, the *only* game in history where, in the accompanying manual, the programmers have personally apologised for what they've done."
