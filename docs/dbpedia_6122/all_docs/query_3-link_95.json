        "text": "Double Dragon Gold 2011 (OpenBOR)\n\nAlright, I actually finished this game and can now give you a proper rundown, it's a fan remake of Double Dragon 1 and 2. Double Dragon Gold is devided in three chapters, the first two copy DD 1 and 2 stories and levels without adding anything special, but the third one is some sort of author's revision of Double Dragon Advance mixed with DD3. There are no cutscenees or anything and storytelling is on the level of the first game - something happens to the girl and protagonists venture onward to break some faces. Each campaign consists of 5/6 short levels, you have to beat prior campaign in order to unlock the next one and the further you go the more difficult the game becomes. There are more playable characters now, Billy and Jimmy got a pair of additional palettes to allow for 4 player coop. After finishing each campaign you will be shown a hint about how to do a certain move, if you don't care about author's intentions than you can scroll down and find pictures of those hints.\n\nThe game fixed a lot of problems I had with the first Double Dragon - hp bloat (there are even hp bars for enemies now), controls, combat and most importantly there's no lag at all. Some of the fixes don't solve the problems completely but it's definitely better now.\n\nMoommyyy\n\nThe combat system is basically Double Dragon 2, but special attacks are much easier to input, there are also moves from Double Dragon Advance with blocking and running, dedicated button was added for rear attacks and unlike in Renegade or Double Dragon 2 it always throws an attack behind you no matter which direction you are facing. Most of the weapons that were present in DD 1 and 2 and Advance are also available here, the most notable missing item is dynamite which didn't make it here for some reason. Enemies are also taken from said games with a couple of exceptions.\n\nAs you would expect there's plenty of author's changes and one you immediately notice is a complete destruction of game's difficulty via huge number of continues - 10, scroll down to the end of this post to find out how to reduce them. Others include reduction of enemies health, slightly altered encounters, sprites, attacks and AI. I don't have much experience with Double Dragon series so I'm just going to describe how I felt about this game in general.\n\nIn first Double Dragon your movelist was basically reduced to elbow strike, because it was crazy OP and approaching enemies face to face wasn't easy. OP moves are still present here (elbow was massively nerfed though) and you are going to be spamming them a lot, but I feel like combat is more varied overall because you can't rely on one attack only and even the said OP moves need to combined with others. For example enemies simply can't defend against running attacks so you use them if you want a reliable knockdown, but the damage of such attacks is low and if you want to beat punks faster you have to take risks, and here comes moveset imbalance.\n\nThe third campaign, the first fight. You're about to get gangraped from the start.\n\nYou want to knock down enemies because it's the easiest way to approach them, only elites and bosses are invulnerable when they wake up, so you can just stand and spam your attack near a downed punk for guaranteed hits. The problem is that hyper knee and tornado kick are absolutely fucking broken. Their damage is huge and they give a lot of invulnerability time, but they are kind of slow to fire, here comes the ultimate combo wombo. Knock down somebody with running attack and while they wake up your tornado kick/hyper knee has enough time to prepare, so stand over somebody and execute the special, watch enemy getting hit for a fuckload of damage and even if they have any wake up attacks that give them invulnerability they are not going to beat yours, because your invulnerability massively outlasts theirs. It also doesn't cost you anything to spam these moves, they don't drain your life and there isn't any power gauge. When it comes to weapons, whip is the deadliest one in the game due to it's huge range that allows you to attack anything without being in any danger of getting hit, but the further you go the rarer it becomes.\n\nIt's pretty easy, but I did not find it as retarded as DD 1 elbow spam. AI is very defensive here so enemies won't just walk into your attacks, though sometimes they walk offscreen for no apparent reason. You won't find opponents that are agressive until the end of second campaign, so most of the time you will be the one doing the first move, don't take it as a difficulty downgrade, because enemies have a great sense of reach just like in others Double Dragon games and will slap you in the face as soon as they can, they are also given a slightly better Z axis range on their attacks compared to yours, so it's not as easy to cheese them.\n\nAt first I found this game to be pretty tough, but once you learn the tricks I described above you will notice that it is easy, save for the few fights. Whatever you can't land your specials on can be spammed to death with running attacks, like Willy (who learned to shoot here btw and does that a lot) who might give you problems with massive range on his melee, but put him against the wall and just run kick him to death, he wouldn't even be able to do anything. Doppleganger fight in the end of second capmpaign is probably the most technical one since he has all the moves you do and that means i-frames spam, but he doesn't hit hard and I wasted him first try and lost about half of the life bar. The two final bosses are honestly pretty retarded, you will fight Willy once again but he will be supported by an infinite number of elite crooks (up to 4 at once) and there's only one wall to bang him against and it's smaller than the others, and final boss goes like this - make single mistake and you're dead, was nice to know you. Other than that there are no bullshit fights in the game, so you might want to lower number of continues to 3 or 2 (or even 1 if you are DD veteran) and leave the number of lives at 3.\n\nI didn't know we were part of sado-maso clan\n\nHowever there is a number of downgrades compared to DD 1, 2 and Advance, they are:\n\n1) Enemies can't run\n\n2) Enemies don't drop weapons when they are knocked down\n\n3) Weapons don't show on enemies sprites, so you can't say if they are carrying something unless they die or attack\n\n4) Enemies don't pick up weapons or at least are not inclined to do so\n\n5) There are no throwable items and weapons (except knife) can not be thrown\n\n6) You can not use specials while carrying weapons, this made me avoid everything except whip, because tornado kick and hyper knee are that good\n\n7) Certain traps were replaced with others more primitive ones, like the pushing blocks in the final level of DD 1 are now spears coming from the floor\n\n8) Doppleganger doesn't have shadow attack, at least I didn't see him using it\n\n9) There are no Five Emperors in the game, you fight Raymond and his recolored clones instead\n\n10) Some enemies lost their unique entrances, like big guys no longer break walls they just spawn off screen\n\n11) Amount of health doesn't influence recovery speed after getting knocked down, everyone gets up at fixed speed no matter current health level\n\nThere might be something else that I didn't notice or just don't know. Overall I liked this game and it is the best experience I've had with Double Dragon so far, it also introduced me to some of the kickass music from the series. Double Dragon Gold might not be an amazing \"remake\", but it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.\n\nNo additional screenshots this time, because there's not much point as the game copies DD 1 and 2 and I didn't make many. Moveset is available in the game itself as well (make sure to scroll it to the end, so you know how to do tornado kick), so here are the pictures of secret moves that are shown to you after you finish one of the campaigns. And after you beat the game three times you can play as any character in the game except doppleganger.\n\nGameplay video\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy only problem is that you are given 9 continues from the start, which is way too much and removes challenge and I haven't found a way to lower it\n\nI managed to find a way to do that. You will have to unpack game's .pak file, but getting it to work was a pain in the ass. Download OpenBOR assests or whatever here, the things that we are going to use are located in \"tools>borpak>scripts\" (but download the entire archive just to be sure) there are 2 .bat files (packer and paxplode) that don't work without an .exe file, which is missing for some fucking reason. Grab the borpak.exe here and put it in the same folder as those 2 .bat files, now paxplode.bat will unpack .pak files, to do so just drag them over .bat file. After the unpacking finishes a \"data\" folder will appear in the same directory where your .pak was, this folder contains all the resources of the game. For Double Dragon Gold open level.txt file and find lines that define the number of continues and lives for each episode, edit them as you please, I assume it works similarly for other games, don't forget to save the changes. After that you need to pack that \"data\" folder back into .pak file. How do you do that ? Drag the folder into packer.bat ? Of course not, because it doesn't fucking work (at least it didn't work for me)! Create new .txt file put this line (without quotes) over there \"borpak -b -d data mod.pak\" and nothing else, change the format of the file to .bat (through \"rename file\" option) and now you have a packing tool. Place the .bat file you created and \"data\" folder in the same directory where borpak.exe is located and drag the \"data\" folder into .bat file, now it actually works and will pack your stuff into \"mod.pak\" file. After that you can rename it and put back to \"paks\" folder and finaly play the game.\n\nWhat the fuck is that ?! Why the fuck you have to do all this shit just to change the number of lives and continues ?! Fucking why is it not an ingame option ?! What an absolute fucking mess!\n\nGaiapolis 1993\n\nOnce again I couldn't find a poster with good resolution, but I think starting screen looks good enough. This is another game from Konami featuring 3 playable characters and a big number of stage that I haven't bother to count, but sources say it's 17, coop supports 2 players. Just like Metamorphic Force this an original entry (i.e. it features it's own universe). This a rather story heavy game for arcades, after each mission there's a cutscene with dialogues, it's also the first arcade I've seen that uses a password system in case you quit before finishing, so you can continue from where you left.\n\nProtagonists, the supposed dragon looks more like a dog.\n\nYou can play as either human - Gerard Himerce, prince of Avalon; dragon - Duke Galahad (who has an abnormally large ass for some reason); fairy halfbreed - Elain Shee. There are no real differences between them, except that fairy can't use shields (she can still block like the others) and her spinnning attack is done differently. Just like other Konami games gameplay is very simple: you have regular combos; block that is done by holding down attack button; spinning attack - do a clockwise (counter-clockwise for fairy) rotation; running attack (you can't actually run in this game) double tap any direction, hold it if you want to run a longer distance before attacking; magic that you acquire by collecting crystals, it grows stronger if you get more crystals without using magic; pets which come in three different kinds, collect corresponding eggs to increase their max health, press \"pet\" button to let it go loose and attack enemies, press button again to recall and let it restore it's health. Characters gain experience by attacking enemies (max level is 30) and collecting items, with each level your health and damage increases, there are some secrets on levels for you to find, they can grant you health, pets, items or even unlock secret levels for you, though I didn't really bother myself to find them.\n\nAt least he can breath fire\n\nThe game has great graphics with lots of special effects, that it can't handle at times, so at times you can experience some lagging, there's great variety in scenery, though for some reason the game's screen has very small width, I suppose hardware just couldn't handle such graphics in proper resolution. Music is nothing amazing (like it was in Metamorphic Force, for example) it's fairly average and forgettable. And that's all positive/neutral things I can say about this game and now I'm about to take a massive dump on it, because it's completely fucking horrible !\n\nMajor fuck up №1 - the gameplay is a complete fucking ass. 90% of time you are going to spam your regular attack, because it has the best damage in most scenarios, sometimes you might do a spinning attack, but have fun inputing that fucking thing, running attack with it's horrible damage is mostly useless, though you can try and cheap bosses and certain enemies with it, also you can't attack knocked down enemies to make process go faster. Your character can't fucking move for shit and running attack doesn't help much, screen moevement is also incredibly delayed, at times I have to walk at the edge of it for a few seconds before it begins to scroll. So, you have groups of enemies to battle, but your maneuverability is almost non-existent, great fucking job ! Can blocking save you ? Well, kind of... Most of the attacks in the game are unblockable and you have to actually face enemies to block them, good thing that blocking massively reduces damage you take and after you take damage your character blinks allowing for a brief invulnerability, so one of the best strategies is to get hit while blocking and attack enemies while you blink. Why's that ? because almost everything can hit you back while you are hitting it and you die really fast in this game.\n\nYou don't have to choose in cases like this, just grab everything (including the priestess), you are a fucking dragon\n\nA lot of enemies deal damage just by fucking touching you ! JUST WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ?! In the game where you can barely move around and have to fight hordes in a very limited space, you can be fucking killed by touching a random crocodile or some other shit ! Due to this your pets are almost useless, because they will quickly get killed just by running into enemies. And enemies quickly turn into hp bloated cunts, that can also protect themselves with shields or just block your attacks with weapons. The bosses are outright retarded, these are the most bullshit, unfun and unfair encounters I have ever seen. Not only they take a lot of space by themselves (and also fucking damage you if they touch you) and have huge range on their attacks, they are also faster than you, have plenty of invulnerability frames and a lot of hp (final boss has 60 fucking health bars and pre-final boss has 72 bars split between 3 mages), unless you saved some powerful spell for them you are pretty much fucked, you are going to just run around without really being able to dodge their attacks and if you try to block, they will either immediately follow up with another or just run away. If you don't want to die, you can cheese them with running attacks or some other shit, but it's so fucking tedious. Not all of them are like this, but 90-95% are and you will experience this as early as encountering the second boss. The game is very greedy with health items at times, the worst case of this is when you go through dark tunnel (I don't remember it's name already) fight a lot of tough enemies and boss at the end and then proceed to fight another boss with a lot of phases, during this time you only get 1 health restoring item and it's a weak one, mind that you don't recover health after beating a level. Also, there are no additional lives or anything, 1 coing = 1 life, so keep throwing you coins at us kids, we really need your money huha ! At first I thought that western game version was harder, just like it was with Metamorphic Force, but japanese version has all the same shit.\n\nFighting crocodiles among some roman-like flooded ruins\n\nMajor fuck up №2 - the game is too long for how simple and awful it is. You will spend at least 1 hour to finish this crap and if you take your time to avoid dying and try to find secrets, you can easily reach 2 hours of playtime before being done with this turd. This probably comes from a game's plot that tries to be epic and give you some sense of adventure, but it's just another retarded and simple fantasy (featuring broken english as usual) story about saving the world from some evil. I don't come playing arcade games expecting a great story and I don't even hate this game's plot ot anything, but while making Gaiapolis developers obviously forgot about managing game's length, hence why there's a password system in place. So the primary motivation for somebody to continue playing (\"playing\" it's just that I don't know english verbs that describe a person moving through an ocean of shit) is to watch cutsceenes and read boring dialogues, at least the pictures are done pretty well. There's also no variety of any sorts, before final level you get to fly on some platform and have to collect items while avoiding obstacles, but besides that there's nothing else to spice up the gameplay.\n\nI think this picture provides a good description of game's challenge (protip - block)\n\nI think that's about everything I have to say about this game. Fuck this shit, stay away from it. There's only one positive thing about Gaiapolis - graphics, only launch it if you want to enjoy some pictures and forget about completing it without dying, it's just not worth it. Can't recommend this game to any sane person and I won't be suprised if this the worst game that Konami made for the arcades. Morrowind faggots might find this game appealing, they are unlikely to be stopped by horrible gameplay and bad writing, pretty graphics and a chance to rummage through boring lore, that nobody gives a fuck about, will keep them entertained for an evening or two.\n\nAdditional stuff:\n\nMore screenshots, warning they are big (Sorry, I was too lazy to cut out black borders)\n\nGameplay videos\n\nFinal Fight 1989\n\nThe king of the arcades, the game that defined mechanics of most of the beat'em'ups that were made after it's release. It's premise is familiar to everybody - some guys have to beat the shit out of criminals that want to control the city and save a girl (Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend) in the process. There are 3 playable characters with coop supporting 2 players and 6 stages with 2 bonus ones.\n\nFather, boyfriend and... a guy\n\nGame's fighting system is very simple and intuitive and moveset shouldn't take you more than a minute to figure out: standing combos, jumping attacks, despair attack and throws. Yep, that's about all you've got. There are a couple of melee weapons thrown in - metal bars, swords and knives, but they are identical in their use except knives, which are meant for throwing. I'm not entirely sure, but this might the first game to introduce the concept of \"despair attack\" to beat'em'ups - move that hits everything around character, while making him invincible at the cost of some health. Protagonists can't run or dash (although some enemies can) and screens are small, so positioning and correct usage of despair attacks and throws (characters are invicible while throwing somebody) is very important if you want to stay alive. The game isn't stingy with health resotoring items until the last stage, you get 2 lives per coin and can earn additional one for scoring enough points.\n\nI was honestly surprised to see such graphics from the game that was released in 1989\n\nIt might seem that the differences between characters are minor, but there's more to them than it might seem: Haggar is the strongest but also the slowest, Cody is balanced and Guy is fastest but also the weakest. I've seen people say that Haggar is easiest one to play, but I think that both Haggar and Guy are inferior to Cody. Haggar has strongest grabs, but I didn't notice much difference in damage between his standing combo and Cody's, though he definitely hits harder than Guy, he is indeed pretty slow and clumsy which can make it difficult to fight off against crowds, as a wrestling character he suffers the same issue as all other characters that use german suplex as their throw move - shitty reach, he also has a significant recovery on whiffing his attack making timing really important, these factors combined + him having the worst reach on despair attack can make it pretty difficult to fight off against crowds. Guy has the fastests walk speed, but I don't think it really matters when most of the enemies still move faster than you and the most dangerous ones have dash attacks that can not be side stepped, his damage is the worst and his standing combo is the longest, making him the overall worst character in the game. Cody on the other hand combines the best of all into one, he isn't slow and his damage doesn't suck, he's the only one that can use knife in melee and surprisingly it's the best weapon in the game combining great speed and best damage (no idea why the fuck it outdamages swords by seemingly 2 times, knives when handled by Cody are the only good weapons really, others are slow and reach isn't that good), his despair attack seems to have the best range and biggest invulnerability window. You might ask \"Why would you care about such small things ?\" well when the gameplay is so simple, you can't help but notice something like this and I really had harder time playing everybody but Cody.\n\nBeating shitheads in a shithouse\n\nI was really suprised with graphics in this game, while you can't call animations \"frame rich\" the sprites and especially backgrounds look great to me, I didn't expect something like this from the game of such age. Can't say the same praises about music, I feel like there are 4 or 5 tracks in the entire game, nothing crazy or sick but they are pretty memorable. There are no cutscenes between missions, only one at the start and one in the end, for some reason I was actually expecting them to advance the plot as you move from level to level. Intro cutscene shows bandits demonstrating kidnapped girl to Haggar through TV and she wears nothing but bra, westerners were terrified of pixel cleavage and cut it out from intro completely in their versions.\n\nThe gameplay is really simple. Nobody except bosses can outrange your attacks, so getting everybody on one side (or standing with your back at the wall) and just throwing out normal attacks can win you most battles, but making it happen is not always simple or even possible. Some enemies can rush you down with no way to avoid that other than iterrupting them with your attack, this is where Haggar suffers the most, because of his long recovery after whiffing an attack, this charge move is a pretty cheap shit, because enemies can use from very close distances giving you no time to react and such attacks deal heavy damage. There are a lot of ambushes in general and game's difficulty is on the \"cheap bullshit\" side. If you aren't careful enough enemies can just gang up on you and clubber you to death, there is no \"fall down after taking enough damage\" mechanic in place so if you don't use your despair attack you can be killed in one combo, you also don't get any i-frames when you get up and can be attacked again immediately, so always wake up with despair attack (and waste more health in process). As I've said previously majority of enemies move faster than you or at comparable speed, some of them can cover the entire screen with jumps, do sliding attacks or charge at you, these attacks aren't as easy to avoid and considering the fact that you are facing huge by beat'em'up standarts crowds (over 7 punks 80% of time) it makes combat pretty chaotic. Also there is a tendency for hp bloat for certain enemies, your standing combos don't do much damage and grabs are really busted (as in really good) in that aspect, so you want to grab tougher guys but it can be pretty hard because of range on their attacks and movement speed, they also tend to hit you out of the air if you try to drop on them and grabs are wonky here, sometimes enemies get out of them in less than a second and sometimes you only get to hit them once during your grab.\n\nThe annoying clusterfuck of items getting in your way when you try to fight enemies is present in it's full strength here. Just look at the picture below. I'm trying to fight off 3 guys, but if I stand anywhere near the knives or chicken, instead of doing an attack I would pick up an item, AND LOOK AT HOW MUCH FUCKING SPACE THEY TAKE ! To make it even more annoying these dudes drop knives about 50% of time when they get knocked down, littering the ground like this. And this example is not a rare situation, during my playthrough I encountered similar shit numerous times. Did the developers even playtest their shit ?\n\nHaggar is about to tear out punk's liver\n\nBut regular enemies can not compare at all with absolutely retarded bosses, out of all only the first one is alright. Their damage is completely broken as you would expect, get used to being hit for 1/3 or even 1/2 of your life bar, they have a big enough healthpool though it's not as annoying if you manage to grab them (it's not easy at all), they outrange you on their attacks and move faster than you, but most importantly they have a fuckload of i-frames. There were a lot of moments where I went \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT ?!\" during my playthrough because it's an absolute fucking bullshit. Second boss - charges at you while being invulnerable, does that after every knock down and delay between charges ranges from 1 to 4 seconds, also invulnerable while preparing for the charge, your standing combo only tickles him and the only real way to deal damage is to land a grab. Third boss massively outranges you and hits you for 1/2 of your life bar in melee, runs away and shoots you when he gets low on health, have fun catching him when you can only walk. Fourth boss - insane range on his grab, does jumping attack that can not be avoided at all unless you do a despair attack that drains your health and does shit damage, and after that he can launch another one right away. Fifth boss - nothing special (he is just a more advanced version of some enemy that encounter regularly) expect absolutely retardedly long invulnerability period after he wakes up. Last boss moves faster than you while being a fucking cripple that is stuck in a wheelchair and even after you break his motherfucking wheelchair he's still faster and more agile than your pumped up martial artists fucking protagonists (AAAAAAAAA), of course he shoots you with harpoones for 1/3 of your life, can not be grabbed and jumps around constantly so you can't combo him, because you hit him while he is in the air.\n\nYou are not allowed to fuck around in this game at all, you're either gonna get killed by ambushes and hazards, beaten down to death by a mob or eat a \"lol fuck you\" move from a boss that drains 1/2 of your life bar. And as I've said this game is simple, so it has nothing to compensate for it's primitive gameplay and unfair challenge, except may be graphics.\n\nCensored picture\n\nOverall Final Fight is an alright and simple game, but cheap difficulty sucks a lot of fun out of it. I say it has more historic value than as a game itself, you will probably notice elements that other games took from it (like lifts in Denjin Makai and Guardians that are clear copies of lift that you fight enemies before enganing Rolento, they even drop grenades at you; or how AVP's 1994 boss - Mad Predator is basically a reskinned version of Rolento himself), I completed the game 2 times and thought it was just ok.\n\nAdditional stuff:\n\nMore screenshots, warning they are big\n\nGameplay videos"
