        "text": "Not in the mood to code today, so let's play a classic: Double Dragon. It's hard to explain nowadays what a phenomenal game it was back then. So before reviewing the NES version, which I'm going to play, let's first talk about the game’s history.\n\nAt the end eighties, there was a Double Dragon machine at the center of every arcade. The game was so popular that it opened up the beat'em up genre. Soon enough, arcades were filled with beloved beat ‘em up games like Golden Axe and Final Fight; and then eventually CAPCOM would lead the genre to whole other level. But even by then, in the mid-nineties, brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee—the stars of Double Dragon—would never lose their spot.\n\nThis story was quite simple: a love interest of Billy and Jimmy gets kidnapped by a street gang. Yep, both brothers are interested in the same girl and—spoiler alert—they fight each other for her at the end of the game. Prior the first stage, a small intro shows henchman's punching and taking the girl away, then the garage door open's up and the music and beat begins. Not exactly an original story, but the game made it feel like a great story; at the least, it was a great eighties story. In fact, there was something about the style that always reminded me of another eighties classic: Streets of Fire style. I swear, whenever I played Double Dragon, I always saw Willem Dafoe as the kidnapper; running off with that kidnapped girl over the shoulders.\n\nAll in all, the arcade game was a classic. I’ll never forget the hours I spent waiting to play the game; talking with others about how to best control the elbow smash or how to throw an enemy from a bridge without falling too. I remember that once I had to wait a guy cleanup the coin safe, 'cause coins were getting jammed. It was the main subject among gamers and game magazines."
