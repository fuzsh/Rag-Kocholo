        "text": "Arc System Works released a gameplay trailer for Double Dragon Revive, coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via Steam in 2025.\n\nDouble Dragon Revive revitalizes the beloved Double Dragon series, a cornerstone of the belt-scroll action genre since its arcade debut in 1987. This anticipated title, fueled by the enduring support of retro game enthusiasts, brings the iconic franchise back to life with a modern twist. Players will enjoy renewed, stylish character graphics that reimagine the classic heroes and villains in contemporary 3D, while still paying homage to the original arcade aesthetics. Powerful foes from the Lee brothers’ past return, ensuring nostalgic yet fresh encounters that longtime fans and new players alike will appreciate.\n\nThe game promises the ultimate belt-scroll action experience, where players traverse horizontally across the screen to defeat waves of enemies. This classic gameplay style is enhanced with refined controls and balance, supervised by seasoned staff from Arc System Works’ fighting game titles. The result is a carefully crafted experience that is intuitive and accessible for newcomers but retains the depth and challenge that veteran players crave. Combat in Double Dragon Revive is more than just button-mashing; it requires strategic thinking, learning enemy patterns, and timing attacks effectively. Players can also utilize weapons scattered throughout the stages and leverage area-specific gimmicks to gain the upper hand, adding layers of strategy to the thrilling action."
