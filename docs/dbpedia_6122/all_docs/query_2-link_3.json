        "text": "Game\n\nE\n\nDouble Dragon [Edit] [Talk]\n\nDouble Dragon is a Nintendo Entertainment System beat em' up released in 1988 in Japan and North America, and 1990 in Europe. It was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console for 500 Nintendo Points.\n\nA Game Boy version was also released in August 1990.\n\nPlot[]\n\nDouble Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers who learned to fight on the cold, tough streets of their city. Their expert knowledge of the martial arts, combined with their street-smarts, have made them both formidable fighting machines.\n\nBut now Billy is faced with his greatest challenge: his girlfriend, Marian, has been kidnapped by the Black Warriors, the savage street gang of the mysterious Shadow Boss! Using whatever weapons come to hand - knives, whips, bats, rocks, oil drums, even dynamite - Billy must pursue the gang through the slums, factories, and wooded outskirts of the city to reach the hideout for his final confrontation with the Shadow Boss... his brother Jimmy!\n\nGameplay[]\n\nNES[]\n\nThe most notable difference the NES version has from the arcade game is the omission of the arcade's two players cooperative game mode. Instead, the two-players mode in the main game (\"Mode A\") is done by alternating, although both players take control of Billy. The game is divided into four different stages or \"missions\", which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss. After defeating Willy, the original final boss from the arcade game, Jimmy will appear before the player for the true final battle.\n\nDue to the technical limitations of the NES, the game can only generate two enemies on-screen to confront the player and both enemies are the same character. Additionally, weapons cannot be brought to the next fight if the original enemy carrying it is defeated. A level-up system was also implemented. The player begins the game with only the basic punches and kicks available to their character, gaining the more powerful ones after acquiring the experience points needed to use them. The player has a total of seven skill levels that they can achieve throughout the game.\n\nThe level designs are very different, with some stages featuring new areas (notably the cavern section in Mission 3) that features greater emphasis on jumping over platforms or evading traps.\n\nThere's also a bonus game mode (dubbed \"Mode B\") where the player can choose between Billy or one of five enemy characters from the main game and compete against a clone of their character controlled by the computer or a second player in a one-on-one match. Matches against the computer are handicapped in favor of the computer-controlled character, while certain characters will get a chance to wield a weapon in the 2-Players matches.\n\nGame Boy[]\n\nThe Game Boy version features gameplay similar to the NES version, but all the of main character's moves are available from the start, without the need of having to accumulate points to unlock them. The roster of enemies is also the same as the NES version, but some of the characters were given new techniques (such as Abobo and Chintai). The levels are also the same as the NES version, although some of their layouts were redesigned to more properly accommodate the Game Boy's hardware, with some levels even featuring a few extra rooms.\n\nThe main game mode is still single player. Unlike the NES version, the game ends after the fight with Willy, with Jimmy not appearing in the main story. A two player game is available via the Game Boy's Game Link Cable, although players must alternate turns like in the NES game. Likewise, a two-player Versus Mode is included, but the only characters available to play as are the Lee brothers.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nBilly Lee\n\nJimmy Lee\n\nMarian\n\nWilliams\n\nLinda\n\nRoper\n\nAbobo\n\nChin Taimei\n\nWilly Mackey\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nThis section requires an expansion.\n\nMore information is needed.

Computer and Video Games first rated the game on May 1988, giving it 80%. It concludes, \"All in all Double Dragon has some very tasty graphics and has got a good solid feel to it (although it does flicker in places!) sound does tend to grate on a bit but is bearable.\"[5] The magazine reviewed the game a second time on December, with Julian Rignall rating it with an 83%. He stated that, \"The Nintendo unfortunately lacks the two-player option, but more than makes up for this deficiency with an extra one-on-one Street Fighter-style game included on the ROM.\"[6]\n\nOn 1989's \"Player's Choice Awards\", Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Double Dragon \"Best Video Game of the Year\" for 1988.[7] On July 1990, the Editors of the same magazine gave 28 points out of 40 for their assessment of the Game Boy port, calling it a near-perfect version of the arcade.[8]\n\nThree months later, Rik Haynes of ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment) would commend the handheld title for being much easier to play than the coin-op. Giving a final score of 863 points out of 1000, he wrote, \"Double Dragon is easily the best beat 'em-up released on the Gameboy thus far. Sprite and backdrop graphics are intricate with a high degree of detail. Boss sprites are big, the vertical and horizontal scrolling is smooth. Soundtracks can became rather irritating, but the sound effects have punchy impact. Sure, this version is easy to complete - but you'll have lots of fun in the process. The link-up mode is just beyond the beat. Double Dragon - get ready to take it out.\"[9]\n\nIssue #9 of RAZE praised Double Dragon for its detailed backdrops, up-beat tunes, Game Link compatibility, and large number of fighting moves. However, the magazine did criticize the blurry effects that make somewhat difficult to see what character is being controlled. With a rating of 78%, the Game Boy version was declared as good as any other variant of the game.[10]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
