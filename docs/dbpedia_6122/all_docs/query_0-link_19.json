        "text": "Truth be told, I intended to write this particular article last year. Unfortunately, it was yet another casualty of my single-minded focus on finishing up last year’s set of retrospectives. I honestly have no idea what it is about those year-end articles that command so much of my attention. But with a clear writing schedule ahead of me, I feel that it’s finally the perfect time to revisit Style in Profile, a project which I already have so many ideas for. Although, calling it “my latest series” feels like a bit of a misnomer if there’s only a single article to its name, wouldn’t you agree? So, let’s rectify that.\n\nThe best place to start would be reminding whatever audience may find this article just what Style in Profile is meant to encompass. Basically, it’s an attempt at looking at various genres within the greater medium of video games. Particularly, I’ll be doing deeper dives into smaller “sub-genres” as opposed to the larger “macro-genres”, like “action”, “adventure” or “RPG”. I’m hoping that this focused approach will allow me to go into greater detail into the criteria that brought about these designations in the first place, without either writing out a truly terrifying dissertation on the subject or being left with a mere sentence fragment like “do thing” or “go place”. So far, I’ve only had the good fortune to cover what I refer to as the “Block Puzzle” genre, but upon concluding this piece, the subject matter covered by this burgeoning series will literally be doubled! Huzzah!\n\nIf the title hasn’t given it away by now, the topic of this article will be the humble “beat-‘em-up”. Unlike the first article, no particular game inspired my decision to focus on this particular genre. When I first became aware of video games, beat-‘em-ups were still enjoying a fair amount of popularity. But as time wore on, the inherent nature of most games of this style being tied with the similarly declining arcade scene in North America would essentially spell doom for this genre. But then, in recent years, due in no small part to digital distribution allowing for smaller, tighter experiences at bargain prices coupled with an all-too-tangible nostalgia for gaming trends that had fallen out of vogue, the beat-‘em-up has seen something of a second renaissance lately. A combination of throwbacks from storied franchises from the genre’s glory days and brand-new games inspired by those hits from yesteryear are proving that this style of games isn’t nearly as dead and buried as we’ve been led to believe. So, without further ado, let’s beat up some goons until they puke, defenestrate a few crime bosses, and dine on some succulent turkey that just happened to be in a nearby trash can!\n\nOverview\n\nLet’s begin by defining the criteria I would use to define a “beat-‘em-up”. First and foremost, I feel that it’s safe to say that beat-‘em-ups fall strictly within the “action” macro-genre, as they rely entirely on real-time input and generally focus on combat. To get into greater specifics, players are tasked with navigating their chosen character through side-scrolling levels, punching out a menagerie of nigh-identical hired goons until they reach the end of a given area, where they’re usually (but not always) met with a distinct, much stronger boss encounter. Rinse and repeat for multiple stages and that’s a standard beat-‘em-up.\n\nWhile those are the most prominent hallmarks of the beat-‘em-up, there are other various mechanical tropes that will often show up in the genre that appear so often, they could easily be considered honorary cornerstones of the genre. For example, while options for cooperative play isn’t exactly mandatory in this style of game – Double Dragon’s NES version might be the most infamous example – they tend to show up more often than not, likely owing to the fact that the genre was clearly most popular in the arcades. After all, it’s easier to make money if you have multiple people paying in at once, as opposed to just having a single paying customer at each cabinet. In fact, beat-‘em-ups would generally offer simultaneous play for up to four players and I can think of at least one example of a six-player cabinet. Likewise, it’s common to find items scattered throughout stages. These range from limited-use weapons, which can deal far more damage than the characters’ standard attacks alone; food items to replenish health and various other pick-ups that give out bonus points. Beat-‘em-ups are prone to toss out seemingly endless hordes of identical enemies to serve as stage fodder, but to differentiate things to some extent, renamed palette swaps signifying stronger variants of existing enemies are fairly common as well. Granted, this isn’t exactly unique to beat-‘em-ups, but I’d argue that it might be the genre with the best justification for using this design trope.\n\nOf course, beat-‘em-ups are generally intertwined with a similar, related but overall larger genre: the fighting game. In fact, many beat-‘em-ups either include game modes that emulate the strictly 1-on-1 competitive nature of fighting games or outright spin-offs in the genre itself. And while the opposite is substantially rarer, it has happened in the past – Tekken Force, anyone? However, I only bring it up because at various points in both genres’ respective histories, it’s been common to use the terms for one genre to refer to the other. While I mainly remember being irritated by people referring to beat-‘em-ups as “fighting games” back in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, I’ve also seen earlier examples of people doing the exact opposite back in the early ‘90s, during that brief period where Street Fighter II’s dominance hadn’t yet led to an avalanche of imitators and knock-offs. While I do intend to cover fighting games in a future entry within this series (I’m honestly still debating on how to cover it), I only mention it here for one reason and one reason only: fighting games are not beat-‘em-ups are not fighting games. I can’t possibly make that clear enough. Despite the overlap in terms of mechanics and subject matter, these two genres offer two wholly different experiences. Fighting games are strictly one-on-one affairs, with what is generally an exclusive emphasis on competition in multi-player, while beat-‘em-ups challenge players to punch their way through an extended stage filled with countless weaker enemies before facing off with a stronger opponent to cap off each area and usually opts for cooperative play in groups… even when friendly fire is enabled.\n\nIrem’s Kung-Fu Master – originally released in Japan as a tie-in game for the Jackie Chan film “Spartan X” – is generally considered the earliest example of a beat-‘em-up. Originally released in arcades in 1984, the game would eventually be ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under Shigeru Miyamoto’s supervision and would be rebranded as simply “Kung Fu” in the West. Of course, this wasn’t the first game that would utilize martial arts in its theming, but Kung-Fu Master contained side-scrolling stages, filled to the brim with easy-to-defeat enemies and capped off with a more difficult boss. If that description sounds familiar, that’s by design. Having said that, the genre wouldn’t really take off until 1986. While there were a few other examples of early, rudimentary beat-em-ups, the genre would only really begin to get popular with the release of Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun, which roughly translates to “Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio”. Developed by a small developer known as Technōs Japan and published by Taito, this first Kunio-kun game would innovate many of the conventions that would come to be associated with the genre for years to come. Implementing a method of control known as “belt scrolling”, players were able to move both horizontally and vertically along the playfield, adding a distinct sense of spacing to the gameplay itself. Likewise, the game also incorporated “combo attacks”, allowing players to perform strings of punches and kicks on their opponents uninterrupted. Kunio-kun also utilized separate buttons for attacking in the left and right direction (in addition to a jump button), but this didn’t impact the genre nearly as much as those first two changes to the formula established by Spartan X. The game’s subject matter also opted for more traditional street brawling rather than aping a martial arts film, inspired by the high school experiences of the game’s lead developer, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, who would get into fights daily. But while Kunio-kun opted for a more grounded style inspired by Japanese high school delinquents, the Western release’s setting would be completely changed, rebranding the game with an aesthetic inspired by the 1979 film The Warriors and would go under the title “Renegade”.\n\nIndeed, Kunio-kun’s popularity in its home market and Renegade’s success in the West (to the extent where the latter even managed to spawn two licensed sequels on various home computers in Europe) would serve as the seeds for an even greater success, a spiritual successor by the name of Double Dragon. Though Kishimoto originally planned to create an arcade sequel for the original Renegade, the higher-ups at Technos Japan asked him to include the option for two-player play and asked him to change the game’s art style to appeal to a broader worldwide audience. Replacing Kunio-kun’s more grounded Japanese high school setting with a post-apocalyptic city inspired by the Mad Max films and the Fist of the North Star series, Kishimoto named this new game “Double Dragon”: with “double” referring to the multi-player aspect of this new game, while “dragon” was an homage to the Bruce Lee film Enter the Dragon. Kishimoto also introduced the concept of side-scrolling stages to the genre – as Renegade simply took place within single-screen arenas – and added cutscenes to tell a more complex and cinematic story. Perhaps the most interesting twist to the game was what happened when completing the game in co-op: instead of simply being rewarded with a shared happy ending after defeating the final boss, both players were tasked with a fight to the death to determine who won the heart of the damsel in distress, Mirian.\n\nWhile Renegade was a success in its own right, Double Dragon opened the floodgates for a deluge of releases in the burgeoning genre. Many other companies would attempt to put out their own beat-‘em-up games in an effort to cash in on Technōs Japan’s absolute arcade dominance. Capcom had Final Fight, Captain Commando and The King of Dragons, among others. Sega had Golden Axe in the arcades and would eventually release Streets of Rage on their Genesis. Konami had a whole host of games that have gone down to be considered the pinnacle of the entire genre. Unfortunately, the vast majority of their popular ones were based on various licenses, including Marvel’s X-Men, The Simpsons and most popular of all, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Of course, Capcom was no slouch in the licensed game field either, releasing such gems as The Punisher, Alien vs. Predator and a pair of games based in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. Hell, Sega even made one based around Spider-Man. And yet, even that’s just scratching the surface: Data East, SNK and Namco all had hits within the genre as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the good times weren’t meant to last. As the 1990s progressed, 3D graphics became a major selling point in arcades. And while the fighting game genre saw early adoption of this visual style with 1993’s Virtua Fighter leading to an entirely new sub-genre forming, beat-‘em-ups didn’t undergo a similar shift. Honestly, I think the most prominent 3D game in the genre was 1996’s Dynamite Deka – released in the West under the title “Die Hard Arcade” as a licensed game based on the popular film series – but by that point, the damage had been done. While fighting games would manage to retain a foothold of relevance throughout the fifth home console generation, it marked the end of the beat-‘em-up’s relevance in terms of mainstream gaming. Of course, given just how intertwined many design decisions were with some of the less reputable aspects of arcades, the genre didn’t really have much of a chance to shift towards the home market like fighting games were able to. Difficulty spikes and unavoidable damage may have made for some choice quarter munchers when the arcade was still king, but few developers were willing to adapt to the different demands of the home market.\n\nHaving said that, I personally believe that while the beat-‘em-up went dormant in the late 1990s, it still managed to make an impact on the industry after its time in the sun had concluded. As far as I’m concerned, they managed to glom onto the greater “action” macro-genre, by way of the character action game. Seriously, you can’t convince me that the gameplay loop of such series as Devil May Cry, God of War and Bayonetta isn’t clearly inspired by the beat-‘em-ups of yesteryear. They just have a much more stylish modern presentation and managed to adapt to the needs of gamers who prefer gaming at home. In fact, I’d even argue that games like Squaresoft’s The Bouncer and Rockstar’s State of Emergency serve as “missing links” between beat-‘em-ups and modern action games.\n\nFortunately, fans of the genre no longer need rely on modern reimaginings to get their brawler fix these days. With the advent of the seventh generation of home consoles bringing smaller, downloadable games to the masses, the seeds of a second beat-‘em-up renaissance were planted. Games like The Behemoth’s Castle Crashers, Ubisoft’s Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game and even a Double Dragon revival from WayForward weren’t major successes at the time, but they performed well enough to convince other companies to make new games in the genre. By the end of the 2010s, we saw several new beat-‘em-ups – both from long-dormant franchises and original IPs – and this burgeoning wave of content has only continued to grow, with what may be the most high-profile releases yet still on the horizon. And while I’m sure the sheer number of new beat-‘em-ups will eventually slow to a trickle, these newer games seem content to carve a path forward for the genre to avoid the near-extinction event that befell it so many years ago.\n\nCommon Sub-Genres\n\nSeparating beat-‘em-ups into distinct sub-genres generally feels like a fool’s errand, yet I still see value in the exercise. In the past, I’ve seen 2D games utilizing weaponry labelled as “hack-and-slash” games to serve as a differentiation… but considering the fact that I’ve never seen anyone refer to Konami’s TMNT games as anything but beat-‘em-ups, it feels like a weak distinction to make, especially since most “hack-and-slash” games tend to be fully 3D. Personally, I prefer to split them into three categories by each game’s respective movement style. It’s not a perfect method by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s probably the best generalized shorthand I have when determining what to expect from the various “flavors” of the genre.\n\n“Belt Scroller”\n\nEasily the most common variety of beat-‘em-up, the so-called “belt scroller” made its debut with the aforementioned Renegade and would go on to dominate a significant majority of the genre’s output throughout both its golden age and recent revival. I’ll be honest, I’m not really a fan of the term “belt scroller”, simply because I don’t particularly understand the significance of the term. But considering its widespread adoption among people discussing the genre, its Japanese origins and the fact that any alternative I’ve racked my brain to devise – “free-roaming” is literally the best I could do – fall flat, I’ll submit to the term for the sake of expediency.\n\nBelt scrollers allow for free movement of the game’s characters – both player-controlled and hostile – across both the X-axis (horizontal) and Z-axis (lateral), allowing them to freely adjust their position throughout the length of the screen and the virtual depth depicted in-game. Couple this with a jump button that allows for very limited vertical control over the characters and the belt scroller served as one of the earliest examples of the “full 3D movement” common in the greater video game medium in modern times. However, given the general visual limitations of pixel-drawn video games at the time, one of the belt-scroller’s greatest weaknesses would be the limitations of depicting 3D space accurately using 2D graphical assets. Fortunately, many games would utilize drop shadows beneath all of the relevant characters and obstacles in order to provide an easy way to line up everything.\n\nI’m trying to avoid mentioning any of the series I’ll be going into greater detail with below, but in the case of belt scrollers, their overall dominance in the beat-‘em-up genre means that it would probably be easier to name games that don’t follow this convention. Still, this might be a good place to showcase some more obscure titles that don’t warrant mention below, but I enjoyed. There’s SNK’s Sengoku trilogy, Data East’s Captain America and the Avengers, Irem’s Ninja Baseball Bat Man (no relation to the famous comic book character), Konami’s Batman Returns for the SNES – which does star said character – Capcom’s Battle Circuit, Sega’s Arabian Fight and Jaleco’s Rushing Beat trilogy (which were all released under different titles in the West).\n\n“Side-Scroller”\n\nWhile belt scrollers may rule the beat-‘em-up genre, they didn’t originate it. That distinction belongs to the humble side-scroller, otherwise referred to as “single-plane” for obvious reasons. Granted, “side-scroller” is generally used as a generic term for the 2D games in the vast majority of video game genres. It means that the game world is limited to two dimensions. While control over the horizontal and vertical planes work the same as with belt-scrollers, depth never really comes into play. This may come across as somewhat more primitive than its more popular cousin, but one could argue that the lack of maneuverability can lead to equally deep gameplay. After all, side-scrolling games offer themselves to more verticality than belt-scrollers, so it’s not uncommon to see these beat-‘em-ups branch out into platforming segments to spice up gameplay.\n\nSide-scrolling beat-‘em-ups are far rarer than their belt-scrolling counterparts, but there are still enough of them worth showcasing. To make matters worse, while belt scrollers are generally easier to discern from other styles of gameplay, it can be difficult to differentiate side-scrolling beat-‘em-ups from the more generalized “2D action game” genre. The first series that comes to mind would be Taito’s The Ninja Warriors. But there’s also SNK’s adaptation of Eightman, Capcom’s Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems and X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse, Dimps’ Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure and Data East’s Bad Dudes series. There are several older titles that would also fall into this category, including the aforementioned Kung-Fu Master, Irem’s Vigilante, Black Belt and My Hero from Sega, and Capcom’s Trojan.\n\n“Multi-Plane”\n\nThis might be a controversial addition, but I feel that it deserves its own listing in this breakdown. I haven’t seen any specific name for this style of beat-‘em-up, so I’ve decided to pitch “multi-plane” as a name for the time being. For the most part, multi-plane beat-‘em-ups do play similarly to their single-plane counterparts with one major difference: the depth of the game world does come into play. Rather than being able to move freely along the Z-axis like in belt scrollers, “multi-plane” games typically have 2 or more layers in its gameplay field, allowing players and enemies alike to hop into the background, the foreground or both by the press of a button or a simple motion of the joystick.\n\nWhile this could arguably serve as a best of both worlds scenario for the other two styles of beat-‘em-up – incorporating the strategic element of three-dimensional spacing found in belt scrollers with the side-scroller’s more precise controls – sadly, this particular style is incredibly rare. Most breakdowns I’ve seen of the genre fold this style in with its single-plane brethren. It’s understandable, given the mechanical similarities between the two, outside of the extra dimension of movement. Still, I just wish that more games had utilized these mechanics to their full potential. Perhaps we’ll see more games in this vein throughout the genre’s second renaissance?\n\nI kind of had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for examples, especially considering the fact that the most high-profile game in this style is important enough to be discussed in greater detail. Still, Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds was the game that originally inspired me to seek out more like it. Natsume’s Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: The Movie for the Super Nintendo is another perfect example of this type of game. Finally, there’s Fill-in-Cafe’s Panzer Bandit, a Japan-exclusive game for the PS1 that utilizes this style of game. While I’m sure there are still at least a few other examples out there that would also fit the bill, it would require a significant amount of time to sift through several obscure beat-‘em-ups to find other games in this style. Hopefully, the three I managed to find – four, if you include the one I’ve yet to reveal – are enough to justify categorizing them separately.\n\nExamples\n\nJust like with the previous article, I’ll be putting the spotlight on ten games that I feel best exemplify the genre in question at large. While many of my choices are significant to the genre’s overall history, I also chose a few games that are more on the obscure side, just to guarantee that this list contains enough variety to broadly represent the entire genre. I’ve also decided to select games that have had “multiple releases” – even if there are just two of them and the second game is just the first game re-released on newer hardware. One-hit wonders just feel unworthy of discussion in my book. I’m also only going to be sticking to entries in each series that actually fall into the beat-‘em-up genre itself, though I do plan on discussing games that don’t qualify briefly as well. So, with that being said, let’s start with the series that arguably kicked off the genre.\n\nKunio-kun/”River City”\n\nFirst Release: Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun/Renegade (1986) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Kunio-kun no Sangokushida yo Zen’in Shūgō!/River City Saga: Three Kingdoms (2021/2022) – Switch, PS4, PC\n\nGenerally considered to be the true progenitor of the beat-‘em-up, Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun is likely the most storied franchise in the genre. I didn’t actually count, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more beat-‘em-up games in the River City franchise than all of the other series I’ll be covering in this breakdown. The fact that despite having the earliest “first release” of the pack, it also boasts the most recent “latest release” as well only reinforces that belief on my part.\n\nHowever, while Renegade may have kickstarted the beat-‘em-up boom of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, it’s safe to say that it wasn’t the most iconic game in the series. That distinct honor goes to its direct sequel, Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari (“Downtown Hot-Blooded Story”) which was originally released on the Famicom in 1989. The second beat-‘em-up in the Kunio-kun series was a significant departure from its predecessor: it boasted a simpler, super-deformed art style that would go onto define the entire franchise, incorporated RPG elements such as in-game stores and stat increases and opting for an open-world setting as opposed to more traditional stage-based progression. The game would eventually launch in North America the following year under the title “River City Ransom”, with a significantly less radical localization – opting to simply rechristen the urban Japanese setting of the original game as a more generic “River City” and aside from various name changes, keeping the rest of the setting and story intact. PAL regions would see the game launch 2 years later under the far more generic “Street Gangs” moniker and various other NES-era Kunio-kun spin-offs would launch in North America under completely unrelated names, “River City” tends to be the most prominent Western branding for the series in the modern day.\n\nKunio-kun would span several titles, both within the beat-‘em-up genre and various others, including a line of sports-themed titles. Few of these would make their way to Western shores, until the aforementioned River City Ransom was remade for the Game Boy Advance by Technōs Japan’s successor company, Million. From that point, international releases would become more common. In fact, this reinvigoration of the brand would eventually lead to a few Western-developed titles. River City Ransom: Underground is a far-flung sequel taking place with a new generation of high-school ruffians from Canadian indie developer Conatus Creative back in 2017. Meanwhile, WayForward reimagined the series as “River City Girls” which stars Misako and Kyoko, two obscure characters that served as main characters Kunio and Riki’s respective girlfriends in one of their previously unlocalized games from the Super Famicom. The original game launched in 2019 and managed to spawn enough interest to not only warrant a sequel – which, as of the time of this writing, is due out sometime later this year – but a complete localization of the game that the girls’ originated from, under the title “River City Girls Zero”. Meanwhile, current property holder Arc System Works is still producing Kunio-kun games of their own domestically with the most recent release reimagining the Three Kingdoms historical saga using the series’ cast. It came out exclusively in Japan for the Switch back in December 2021, with a worldwide release for the PS4 and PC (as well as an international Switch release) set for this July. With two major titles set to release this year, I think it’s safe to say that the River City games will continue to serve as the beat-‘em-up genre’s elder statesman for years to come.\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nFirst Release: Double Dragon (1987) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Double Dragon IV (2017) – PlayStation 4, PC, Nintendo Switch\n\nWith Kunio-kun done and dusted, it’s time to focus on its younger, more popular burnout of a brother. I always thought it was bittersweet that a single company produced both the longest-lasting beat-‘em-up franchise and the one that clearly had the most mainstream appeal… and then proceeded to disintegrate in 1996. That kind of says a lot about the genre’s lasting appeal, doesn’t it?\n\nThe original Double Dragon game revolves around Jimmy and Bimmy Billy Lee, twin brothers who are martial arts masters who have mastered a powerful fighting style known as Sou-Setsu-Ken. However, a street gang known as the Black Warriors wants this power, so they abduct Mirian, the brothers’ girlfriend (they don’t really make it clear which one she’s dating) to force them to reveal their secrets, so the Lee brothers decide to carve a path of destruction with their fists to get her back. I’m oversimplifying because despite Technōs Japan’s original intentions for a shared setting worldwide, their various licensing partners would all take liberties with the story. While the original Japanese story explicitly takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, most Western releases just treated the dilapidated cityscapes as little more than your average, ordinary urban decay. The second game only made matters worse. While Mirian is gunned down at the very start of each and every version of the game – thus putting the “revenge” in “Double Dragon II: The Revenge” – her fate varies from remaining dead for the remainder of the series to being resurrected by some magic powers in the possession of the game’s true final boss.\n\nRegardless of the miscommunication between regions, the first two Double Dragon games were such incredible successes in the arcade that they spawned several home conversions, most notably for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Granted, the NES version of the first game was a significant downgrade from the arcade original. It outright dropped the multiplayer aspect of the main game in favor of a one-on-one fighting mode, where players were forced to use the same character in two-player mode. Double Dragon II: The Revenge’s NES release, on the other hand, was akin to a full expansion, essentially doubling the game’s stages and bringing two-player back to the forefront. In fact, this version was so well-regarded, that it even managed to serve as the basis for at least one other home conversion: the Japan-exclusive PC Engine CD release opted to recreate the NES version instead of going for a more accurate arcade port. More importantly, it served as one of the first beat-‘em-up games I ever played, helping to cement my love for the genre to this very day.\n\nUnfortunately, the third game was generally considered a disaster no matter the platform. The arcade version was developed by a company called East Technology and didn’t seem to involve the input of any of the previous games’ developers: in fact, Technōs Japan themselves instead focused on the development of The Combatribes, which I’ve seen christened as “the true Double Dragon 3” by modern-day commentators. The arcade version (subtitled “The Rosetta Stone”) added “Sonny”, a third Lee brother to allow for three-player play, but also incorporated what has been referred to in retrospect as one of the first examples of microtransactions in the video game medium. At the start of certain stages in the original North American release, players can enter an item shop, essentially trading quarters for power-ups, including weapons and special moves. The game also reimagined the very concept of extra lives, essentially allowing players to purchase the ability to play as various other martial artists as opposed to just having multiple chances to use the Lee brothers on a single continue. Fortunately, the Japanese version dropped the item shop entirely, allowing players to pick up weapons in-game and select between the various alternate characters freely, with their entire repertoire of moves available from the start. Of these new mechanics, only using different characters as extra lives made it to the NES version (subtitled as “The Sacred Stones”), which wasn’t so much an arcade port, but a companion project that was developed in parallel with the arcade release. Various other home ports were strictly based on The Rosetta Stone, though. The Genesis and Game Boy versions were even subtitled as “The Arcade Game” to make that point absolutely clear.\n\nFrom there, the SNES-exclusive Super Double Dragon was essentially released as an unfinished beta in North America, while the Japanese version (Return of Double Dragon: “Sleeping Dragon” Has Awoken) was more reminiscent of a proper final product. But while the series’ reputation was essentially shot in the realm of video games, the good will accrued from the first two games didn’t completely evaporate. Double Dragon is one of the rare video game franchises that managed to achieve both a Saturday morning cartoon series and a live-action film in the 20th century. Honestly, the only other examples that I can think of are Super Mario Bros., Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. But Double Dragon managed to push the envelope even further than its contemporaries: both adaptations received tie-in video games of their own – Street Fighter could only manage one based on its live-action film in a misguided effort to fight Mortal Kombat on its own terms! Of course, both of the games in question were fighting games, rather than beat-‘em-ups. And while Tradewest’s Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls (based on the cartoon) is generally lambasted as a game that’s mediocre at best, Technōs Japan’s own effort for the Neo Geo (simply titled “Double Dragon” and very loosely based on the live-action film) is generally considered a cult classic.\n\nThe Lee Brothers also managed to score a crossover with the Battletoads franchise, thanks to the fact that Tradewest held the publishing rights to both franchises in the West. The “creatively”-titled Battletoads & Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team is generally considered one of the more memorable games in the franchise (as far the West is concerned), though it’s essentially built off of the Battletoads games’ engine and the Double Dragons don’t really add much to the game mechanically, serving more as set-dressing. Still, if I may date myself, back in the ‘90s, crossovers were a pretty big deal, regardless of how disappointing the final product itself may have been. I guess we just weren’t burnt out on them yet: they were significantly rarer back then compared to today.\n\nThese days, Double Dragon as a franchise isn’t doing so hot. Like River City Ransom, the first game received a remake for the Game Boy Advance, considered by many to be one of the best games in the franchise. But unlike Kunio-kun, it didn’t really spark a major renaissance for the series. An Xbox Live Arcade-exclusive reimagining of Double Dragon II, this time subtitled as “Wander of the Dragons” is widely considered to be one of the worst games on the entire platform. WayForward did their part to attempt to bring back the series with Double Dragon Neon, a game that received mixed reviews (but I personally adore). And upon obtaining the rights to Technōs Japan’s back catalog, Arc System Works tried their hand at making a proper “Double Dragon IV”, which didn’t fare much better – most responses I’ve seen labelled the game as a “half-baked ROM hack of the NES version of Double Dragon II”. Since then, the series has once again fallen dormant, though occasionally various characters will make cameos in the various River City games.\n\nFinal Fight\n\nFirst Release: Final Fight (1989) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Final Fight One (2001) – Game Boy Advance\n\nAs I said before, Double Dragon would go on to spawn several imitators and perhaps the best known of the lot is Capcom’s own Final Fight. Originally devised as a sequel to the 1987 fighting game Street Fighter – even being developed under the working title “Street Fighter ‘89” – Final Fight essentially took the Double Dragon formula and went… bigger. The character sprites were significantly larger, taking advantage of their CPS1 hardware; the game had 6 stages – both Arcade Double Dragons had only 4 stages each – and Final Fight’s levels were significantly longer and even offered three unique selectable characters with their own different strengths and weaknesses. Cody Travers was the all-arounder who was adept with knives, Mayor Mike Haggar had powerful grab moves and used the lead pipe to his advantage and the Bushin Ninjutsu practitioner known simply as Guy was the fastest of the three and wielded katana with a mastery the other two can’t match. Together, the three of them must fight off the Mad Gear Gang, who have kidnapped Haggar’s daughter (and Cody’s girlfriend) Jessica to pressure the mayor to turn a blind eye to their illicit activities.\n\nWhile the arcade version was great, the SNES version had to scale back on stages, one playable character and even the multiplayer mode. But that didn’t stop Nintendo’s 16-bit powerhouse from playing host to the other two mainline games in the series. After that, the series went on a brief hiatus, before trying to branch out into other genres. 1999 brought us Final Fight Revenge, a maligned 3D fighting game released in the arcades and on the Sega Saturn – which, despite only seeing release in Japan, was actually developed by Capcom USA. Then, following an enhanced remake of the original game for the Game Boy Advance (I’m sensing a pattern…), the last game in the series was Final Fight: Streetwise, a PS2 game that tried to ape the Grand Theft Auto series to poor critical reception. This would serve as the nail in the franchise’s coffin to this day, but characters from the Final Fight series have been making appearances in the Street Fighter series from Street Fighter Alpha back in 1995 to this very day. So, while Final Fight is currently stuck in limbo, at least it hasn’t been completely forgotten.\n\nGolden Axe\n\nFirst Release: Golden Axe (1989) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Golden Axed: A Cancelled Prototype (2020) – PC\n\nOf course, not every beat-‘em-up stuck to a gritty urban setting. Golden Axe stood out from its peers by going for a high fantasy setting. The forces of the mighty Death Adder are slowly taking over the realm of men, bolstered by the power of the mighty weapon of the gods, the titular Golden Axe. To fight this ever-encroaching invasion, three heroes that all lost loved ones at the hand of the cruel giant take up arms: the mighty barbarian Ax Battler, the Amazon princess Tyris Flare and the dwarven warrior Gilius Thunderhead. Golden Axe was unique in the sense that it utilized a magic system rather than traditional special moves. By collecting magic potions, each character gains access to more and more powerful screen-clearing spells. Various rideable monsters could also be found through the various stages, including fire-breathing dragons and a strange (yet iconic) creature, known only as “the Chicken Leg”, which first appeared in Sega’s Altered Beast.\n\nAfter a successful arcade launch, the home release on Sega’s 16-bit Genesis console was one of the few pre-Sonic games that managed to maintain its relevance after the blue blur made his grand debut. The Genesis would eventually spawn a direct sequel – creatively titled “Golden Axe II” – which essentially recycled the first game’s formula. Then, in 1992, Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder was an arcade-based sequel released on Sega’s System 32 hardware. Sadly, this game wouldn’t see any home releases until recently… and it’s currently only available via various miniature arcade cabinets. The Genesis would see an unrelated third game (“Golden Axe III”, natch) which would release normally in some regions, but was originally a Sega Channel-exclusive in North America. Golden Axe would also see various spin-offs, including two Zelda-inspired games for the Master System and Game Gear, a middling arcade fighter that also saw a Saturn release and the terribly maligned Golden Axe: Beast Rider, a modern reboot of the IP that took a lot of inspiration from the God of War games. But perhaps the most demoralizing release in the series is its most recent. Back in the 2010s, Sega Studios Australia, the studio behind the Castle of Illusion remake that was way better than it had any right to be, pitched a Golden Axe reboot. Sega didn’t end up picking it up, but they did release their vertical slice demo on Steam in honor of their 50th anniversary under the title “Golden Axed: A Cancelled Prototype”. Since Sega has been licensing out some of their classic franchises to other companies as of later, hopefully we’ll see a worthy successor someday.\n\nBare Knuckle/Streets of Rage\n\nFirst Release: Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage (1991) – Megadrive/Genesis\n\nLatest Release: Streets of Rage 4/Bare Knuckle IV (2020) – PS4, PC, Switch, Xbox One\n\nOf course, Golden Axe wasn’t Sega’s only major contribution to the beat-‘em-up genre. While Golden Axe was clearly their most iconic arcade brawler, Streets of Rage [called “Bare Knuckle” in Japan] was a strictly console-based affair. Most people generally consider this to be Sega’s answer to Nintendo’s exclusive control over the Final Fight franchise on 16-bit hardware, mainly due to the similar aesthetic and setting. Three former police officers – Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter – take on the crime boss Mr. X and his syndicate single-handedly, as he sends waves of thugs, dominatrices and martial artists to stop them as they fight their way through Wood Oak City. I’ve seen some sources claim that the original Streets of Rage was even built off of the Genesis version of Golden Axe’s engine, which makes it all the more ironic that the SoR trilogy would go onto completely overshadow future games in the Golden Axe series… at least in North America.\n\nIn fact, that first game only managed to receive sequels at the behest of Sega of America. Development on a sequel was delegated to Ancient, a small developer run by composer Yuzo Koshiro and his family. And despite Sega of Japan’s relative apathy toward the project, Streets of Rage 2 is generally considered one of the best beat-‘em-ups of all-time and made substantial enhancements over its predecessor. Meanwhile, Streets of Rage 3 was a more controversial release… at least in the West. Policies meant to harm the video rental market and draconian content regulations meant that Bare Knuckle III was substantially altered for its Western debut, resulting in a game that left many fans disappointed, your humble author included. To make matters worse, despite the franchise’s popularity among Sega properties, Streets of Rage would eventually fall dormant once the Genesis was retired.\n\nThat isn’t to say that there weren’t attempts to revive it. Sega originally enlisted Core Design to develop a 3D entry in the series, but once the British developer revealed their aspirations to go multi-platform, Sega withdrew their support. The project would eventually see the light of day under the title “Fighting Force”, a game that released on all major fifth-generation platforms… with the exception of the Sega Saturn, ironically. Sega’s Japanese branch also considered producing a 3D Streets of Rage 4 on the Dreamcast, but supposedly decided against it because they believed “no one wanted it”. And after Backbone Entertainment brought Streets of Rage 2 to Xbox Live Arcade, they pitched their own take on a fourth Streets of Rage game which was outright rejected. Eventually, the only relief fans could find came in the form of the fan game “Streets of Rage Remake”, which was quickly shot down by Sega’s legal team but continues to persist to this day in the shadows.\n\nAn official follow-up would eventually be helmed by French publisher DotEmu, who teamed up with developer Guard Crush Games and Lizardcube (the company that handled a remake of Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap for DotEmu) to finally produce an official fourth game in the series, taking place several years after the original trilogy. Reactions have been mixed on the game, with some claiming it may actually overshadow the original trilogy in terms of quality, while others believe that the fan remake was superior in every conceivable way. Since then, the “Mr. X Nightmare” DLC expansion added three previously unplayable boss characters to the game’s roster – newcomer Estel Aguirre, a returning Max Thunder and Shiva – as well as adding the titular “Mr. X Nightmare” mode, which serves as a rogue-lite gauntlet that added massive replay value to an already stellar game. Sadly, the relative success of SOR4 hasn’t quite cemented a continued future for the series, though it was recently announced that Sega optioned a live-action film based on the series after the success of their Sonic the Hedgehog films. Hopefully, that leads to more games down the line.\n\nKonami’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games\n\nFirst Release: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1989) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled (2009) – PS3, Xbox 360\n\nOf course, the company that probably benefitted the most from the beat-‘em-up boom in North American arcades was none other than Konami. While these days, they’re best known for their unprecedented fall from grace, it feels like just yesterday when they were putting out hit after hit on consoles and in the arcades alike. Sadly, their most prominent contributions to the beat-‘em-up genre came in the form of licensed games. While X-Men produced a six-player extravaganza and the inspired choice of adapting the animated sitcom The Simpsons into a belt-scroller is still one of the best loved examples of the genre to this day, they only paled in comparison to what Konami was able to achieve with the absolute phenomena that was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While the franchise got its start as an independent comic back in the 1980s and still persists to this day, it would never match the heights of popularity it saw in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, when Turtlemania was at its zenith.\n\nOf course, the TMNT games may be the most memorable of Konami’s licensed output, simply because they managed to obtain both the arcade and console rights to the franchise. And while Konami explored other genres with this genre, the most iconic games associated with the franchise were those classic arcade-style beat-‘em-ups. The first arcade version received a port to the Nintendo Entertainment System – under the title “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game”, as there was a previous unrelated NES game – with various downgrades (including dropping the game from 4-player simultaneous play to a mere 2), but also added a few extra stages and bosses. Either way, the NES game was popular enough to warrant an exclusive sequel, TMNT III: The Manhattan Project.\n\nBut before that, the arcade version achieved a sequel all its own. Turtles in Time was generally considered superior to the original in every conceivable way and that goes double for the home port, courtesy of the SNES, which came after the third NES game and was thus considered as the “fourth game” in that particular series. The downgrades were substantially less noticeable – though the game would once again drop to a mere two players – and the enhancements and tweaks over the arcade original were much more significant. To this day, Turtles in Time is generally considered one of the best beat-‘em-ups of all-time (if not the best), though some may argue over which version is superior. Fortunately, Konami wouldn’t leave Sega in the cold this time, opting to make a rearranged version of the game for the Genesis that would even take content from other games in the series and was subtitled as “The Hyperstone Heist”. While this entry is generally considered inferior to Turtles in Time, it’s still considered one of the best belt-scrollers on the Genesis. And personally? I’d argue that’s where the competition was significantly stiffer.\n\nKonami would eventually go on to make 3D brawlers based around the 2003 TV series, though they would also include tie-in side-scrolling beat-‘em-ups on the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS. But despite being developed by Konami themselves, these portable games generally aren’t counted as proper successors when fans consider the series’ legacy. Whether that’s because they weren’t belt-scrollers or because they were based on a different adaptation of the series – my money’s on the latter though. Either way, the rights would eventually shift to Ubisoft… who, surprisingly, actually put a greater emphasis on those classic coin-ops than Konami did in their final days with the IP. While Konami’s second and third forays into 3D brawlers included unlockable versions of the 1989 arcade game and its direct sequel respectively (albeit with a changed soundtrack), Ubisoft themselves would somehow wrangle the rights to do a proper re-release of the first arcade game on Xbox Live Arcade in 2007. Two years later, they would attempt to cut out the middleman with a digital-only remake of Turtles in Time for XBLA and the PlayStation Network. Being based on the arcade version and essentially coming across like a charmless retread that simply went through the motions of the original, this version was absolutely savaged by critics and gamers alike.\n\nFortunately, when Nickelodeon acquired the rights to the franchise from original series creators Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, they would begin a massive media push for the series across multiple mediums. These would include two projects that made old-school fans of the franchise celebrate. First, they would partner with DotEmu (fresh off their success with the aforementioned SoR4) and developer Tribute Games to create Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a retro-inspired belt-scroller that absolutely exudes a truly incomparable love for Konami’s arcade hits and the franchise itself. Later on, they would also announce that they were partnering with Konami themselves to produce TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection – a compilation that includes just about every TMNT game Konami had ever released in the arcades, on home console and even on handhelds based on the original late ‘80s cartoon. Both projects are expected to launch sometime this summer, which should make for one shell of a time.\n\nSplatterhouse\n\nFirst Release: Splatterhouse (1988) – Arcade\n\nLatest Release: Splatterhouse 3 (1993) – Megadrive/Genesis\n\nWith what are likely agreed upon as the five most important franchises in the beat-‘em-up genre all covered, let’s move onto what is perhaps my most controversial inclusion of the bunch. While the Splatterhouse franchise is typically associated with horror in the same way that games like Castlevania and Darkstalkers would be. Not “horror games” per se, but ones that at least use various settings and tropes associated with horror from other mediums. Splatterhouse details the story of Rick, who visited the infamous West Mansion with his girlfriend Jennifer. Suddenly, monstrous hordes hiding within the cursed mansion kidnap Jennifer and strike poor Rick down, leaving him for dead. Making a deal with a cursed artifact known as the Terror Mask, Rick transforms into a hulking brute with the strength to fight back against the zombies, cursed dolls and various other abominations to rescue his lady love. The original arcade game would eventually see a port to the TurboGrafx-16. Sequels would appear on the Sega Genesis: Splatterhouse 2 continued the story of the first game, where Rick joins forces with the Terror Mask again to save Jennifer’s soul, while Splatterhouse 3 took place years later. The third and final game of the original trilogy also underwent a significant gameplay overhaul from its predecessors. While its predecessors were strictly side-scrolling affairs, Splatterhouse 3 took greater advantage of being designed with the home market in mind. The game would shift to a belt-scroller with more open progression through a less-linear mansion and even offered multiple endings based on completing various objectives within a time limit.\n\nTruth be told, my editor fought me on including this. While he didn’t deny that the third Splatterhouse definitely counted as a beat-‘em-up, he was much more skeptical about including the first two. In the end, our disagreement came to the genre’s progenitor: the gameplay in the first two Splatterhouse games fall completely in line with that of Kung-Fu Master, which is generally accepted to be the first example of a “beat-‘em-up” video game. With that in mind, I feel confident about including it on this list.\n\nThere was also a Japan-only spinoff released on the Famicom, subtitled “Wanpaku Graffiti” (which roughly translates to “Naughty …Graffiti”). This game was more of an action-platformer, but it managed to predate Splatterhouse 2 in terms of following up the series and included a more light-hearted tone, utilizing “super-deformed” characters and veering more into parody than the straight-laced mainline games. Splatterhouse would also eventually see a complete reimagining in 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3… but this game would be more akin to a hack-and-slash action game. Mixed opinions aside – personally, I loved it – this game also includes the first three games in the series as bonus features. But after that reboot received poor sales, the series has remained dormant ever since. However, Bandai Namco did apply for a copyright for “Splatterhouse Encore” a few years back and similar copyrights for Mr. Driller and Klonoa have recently borne fruit, so only time will tell…\n\nGuardian Heroes\n\nFirst Release: Guardian Heroes (1996) – Saturn\n\nLatest Release: Guardian Heroes (2011) – Xbox 360\n\nWhile the beat-‘em-up genre truly began to disappear during the fifth generation of home consoles, there were a few attempts at breathing new life in the genre. Easily the most prominent example of this ultimately failed movement was Guardian Heroes. Developed by the fine folks at Treasure – one of Sega’s best outside developers during the days of the Genesis – Guardian Heroes was essentially a hybrid between concepts found in the beat-‘em-up and action-RPGs, essentially serving as another step in the movement River City Ransom started so many years before. It’s also the only major example of what I termed a “multi-plane” beat-‘em-up that managed to make the cut, though many sites refer to it as strictly being a side-scroller.\n\nThe game’s storyline has far more in common with action RPGs of the era, leaning into a high fantasy setting revolving around wizards, knights and warring gods. The game’s story mode is unique in the sense that it allows for multiple branching paths and different endings depending on several factors, including a karma meter which fluctuates based on whether the player kills enemies or civilians. Players can level up their character’s stats with experience points, increasing them between levels with the choice of six categories: Strength, Vitality, Intelligence, Mentality, Agility and Luck. There’s also a “versus” mode that allows for up to 6 players to compete in battle and can even select characters that are unplayable in the main campaign.\n\nGuardian Heroes is generally considered one of the more memorable cult classics from the Saturn’s library. It would even manage to earn a sequel on the Game Boy Advance in 2004, creatively titled “Advance Guardian Heroes”. The game would also be remade for the Xbox 360 in 2011. This was possible because staff at Treasure managed to find the game’s source code but required the help of various division in Sega to recreate a Saturn development environment necessary to recompile the code for the new version. Sadly, this was the last release we’ve seen in the series to this day. Treasure did express interest in re-release various older games on new platforms at one point, but recently, the developer has been left essentially dormant. Hopefully, we’ll be able to see another re-release of Guardian Heroes and many of their other cult classics in the near future.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game\n\nFirst Release: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game (2010) – PS3, Xbox 360\n\nLatest Release: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game Complete Edition (2021) – PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch, PC, Stadia, Luna\n\nFrom there, let’s move onto a more contemporary release. The advent of digital distribution across services like Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and WiiWare throughout the seventh home console generation allowed for a resurgence of classic titles that were essentially forgotten as hardware continued to become more and more powerful. Therefore, developers and publishers alike would begin to revisit concepts that were dismissed as archaic and unable to justify major releases as smaller projects with budgets to match. Genres that lay dormant would begin to arise once again. And while 2D fighting games managed to kickstart a new era thanks to the mainstream success of Street Fighter IV, the seeds for the revival of the humble beat-‘em-up were planted with more subtlety…\n\nPerhaps the most prominent example in this first wave of new-school beat-‘em-up was Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, released exclusively on Xbox 360 and the PS3 via the XBLA and PSN services, respectively. Based on the graphic novel by Bryan Lee O’Malley and likely greenlit as a tie-in to the live-action film adaptation, the Scott Pilgrim game leaned heavily into the pop culture sensibilities of its source material, boasting a pixel art aesthetic brought to life by pixel artist Paul Robertson, a chiptune-flavored soundtrack from Anamanaguchi and several references to video games also made within the original book. The Game’s story consisted of the kind of loose adaptation of the original series’ plotline one would expect from a tie-in game from the 1990s and allowed up to four players to choose various characters from the series, each with their own unique set of attacks. Each character could be leveled up to improve their stats and increase their movesets. Likewise, enemies often dropped coins that could be spent in shops found throughout the game to replenish health and boost a character’s stats. In other words, the game was effectively a cross between the linear nature of arcade beat-‘em-ups like Konami’s TMNT games mixed with the RPG-lite elements of River City Ransom… and among both long-time fans of the genre and those just discovering it for the very first time, it was a very beloved game.\n\nSo, when the game was delisted from both storefronts at the end of 2014 – generally assumed to have happened due to Ubisoft’s license expiring – the backlash was relatively loud and caustic. People would continue to demand a physical release from Ubisoft, to make sure that game could continue to exist in some other form for future generations to play. However, throughout 2020, both Bryan O’Malley and Edgar Wright (director of the aforementioned live-action film) hinted that a re-release would be happening: a tease that was eventually confirmed by Ubisoft themselves on September 10th, 2020. This new version of the game would even include the paid DLC from the original version free of charge, delivering a truly complete edition. Best of all, they also partnered with Limited Run Games to produce a physical version of the game for both the Switch and PS4. Granted, both appear to be out of stock at the time of this writing, but the fact that they exist at all – coupled with the fact that this new release included what some might charitably call a “PC release” – is great news for anyone looking to preserve the game so that people in the future can still play it, regardless of whether the license expires again.\n\nDragon’s Crown\n\nFirst Release: Dragon’s Crown (2013) – PS3, PS Vita\n\nLatest Release: Dragon’s Crown Pro (2018) – PS4\n\nLet’s conclude this list with the newest game by far. Admittedly, I had difficulty choosing for this one. I was looking for a game that had at least two releases, wasn’t based on an existing property and mainstream recognition. In the end, Dragon’s Crown from Vanillaware was the only logical choice that fit all of those criteria. Sadly, most new-generation beat-‘em-ups have yet to generate sequels… and the ones that do come from existing franchises waking up from a long hibernation.\n\nWhile many of Vanillaware’s action games take clear inspiration from the beat-‘em-up genre, Dragon’s Crown is probably the one that falls the most into the genre. In fact, both in terms of setting and gameplay, it appears to be an homage to Capcom’s games based on the Dungeons & Dragons property – games that straddled the line between belt-scroller and action RPG more than anyone would have expected from a coin-op. Dragon’s Crown, however, leans even further into the action RPG direction, incorporating a free-roaming open world as opposed to stage-based progression, allowing for more complex dungeon designs and even non-combat environments that allow for world-building via interacting with friendly NPCs. There are six character “classes” to choose from, though in practice, half of them are gender-swapped counterparts to the others in terms of their specialities.\n\nWhile the game was originally released on the PS3 and Vita, a remaster was released 5 years later on the PS4. This version included higher resolution graphics, both voicetracks, all of the DLC from the previous release, cross-platform compatibility with the previous versions and various other balance adjustments and bugfixes. While I’d like to see the game released on even more platforms in the future, presently Vanillaware is focusing on their most recent title: the real-time strategy game 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which recently saw a Switch port a few years after its initial release on PS4.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile I chose the topic of the first Style in Profile based on a game I had recently played, this article on beat-‘em-ups didn’t have the same level of inspiration behind it. I actually chose the topic for the next article in this series right after I finished up the first one. Then, it seemed a whole host of new announcements in the genre sprung up that only seemed to reinforce my decision. Likewise, the beat-‘em-up genre itself is in a far better place than the block puzzle genre is these days. I have to wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that there isn’t a single franchise that overshadows literally everything else. Without a Tetris-level behemoth demanding any and all potential attention for the genre, this has led to much more variety among the beat-‘em-up revival. Perhaps the downfall of Double Dragon was the best thing that could’ve happened for the genre at large.\n\nBut what do you think? Would you separate beat-‘em-ups from 2D hack-and-slash games? Did I leave out any major beat-‘em-up franchises that defined the genre? Is Kung-Fu Master really the first beat-‘em-up or is there something else that predates it? Feel free to sound off in the comments below.\n\nAnother year has come and gone and once again, the itch returns: it’s time to go port-begging for the holidays! Admittedly, it’s become a lot more fun doing these write-ups on a yearly basis – well, as long as you don’t count my April Fools console port article and the GOG article in August, but those have different criteria. It’s way less stressful discovering games new and old that were skipped over when it comes to my platform of choice over the course of a year than it was every other month. Of course, that also means that I have to be substantially more careful with my choices, but that adds to the fun. I can’t tell you how much filler there was on my old lists – Tekken Revolution doesn’t even exist anymore!\n\nAll three of my lists from last year will be reappearing this time – my top 5 gains of the year, a list of 10 brand-new port requests and even the overall rankings – but I’ll also be adding a fourth. It’s probably going to be a one-time deal: I had a hard enough time coming up with this list in the first place and frankly, given the subject matter, I honestly hope I won’t ever be able to find another 10 games that fit the bill.\n\nBut before we move onto the actual meat of the article, I’ve got to brag about what’s been announced for PC since the last list came out. First up on the docket, we’ve got Grasshopper Manufacture’s free-to-play rogue-like Let It Die, which was announced a little more than a week after my last article on August 10th and came out the following month. Later that month, Capcom would announce an HD re-release of Onimusha: Warlords – one of my favorite games from the sixth-generation – on everything, including PC. Things would go quiet after that until the following month where two announcements would come from an unlikely source: a Nintendo Direct. Capcom Beat-‘Em-Up Bundle and Katamari Damacy Reroll were both announced for the Switch and the PC. The former essentially takes care of what I wanted most of all from Final Fight: Double Impact – specifically the original Final Fight arcade game with online play – while Reroll is an HD remaster of the original Katamari Damacy, something I wouldn’t have dreamed could ever come to PC, regardless of how much I wanted it. Beat-‘Em-Up Bundle is already available – despite an unexplained late launch on PC compared to consoles – while Katamari is due out later this month. Tokyo Game Show didn’t bring much on the PC ports front for obvious reasons, but Capcom did announce that an HD release of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy will be gracing all three major consoles and PC sometime next year. Just shy of a week after that announcement came the big one: ARIKA officially announced that Fighting EX Layer would be coming to Steam, though they implied that this was only possible due to their arcade port and the title’s future may very well depend on the sales of these new releases. Finally, there’s Sunset Overdrive, which wasn’t technically announced officially until the day the game was released – November 16th – but we’ve had leaks going back to May, where it was rated in South Korea. Then it was rated by the ESRB… and then a store page appeared on Amazon. You have to give Microsoft credit for sticking to their guns and still pretending like it was a surprise release, though.\n\nOf course, there were some cool things popping up on GOG as well. The entire Jill of the Jungle trilogy was released there on November 2nd for FREE! Meanwhile, three more King of Fighters games – The King of Fighters ’98 Ultimate Match Final Edition, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match and The King of Fighters XIII (rechristened as the ”Galaxy Edition” after GOG’s client) – were also added to their library. That’s all I’d consider relevant so far, though considering the fact that Sony managed to nab Battle Arena Toshinden on both the Western and Japanese versions of their upcoming PlayStation Classic, that implies that we know who GOG would need to ask to relicense those games. Also back in August, THQ Nordic released some of Microsoft’s Windows Store-exclusive titles on Steam, as well as physical releases. I mainly cared about Super Lucky’s Tale and ReCore: Definitive Edition out of their first batch, but there were also Disneyland Adventures, Rush: A Disney – Pixar Adventure and Zoo Tycoon: Ultimate Animal Collection. It’s been speculated they might be handling a physical release of Sunset Overdrive on PC as well, but there’s been no concrete information on that front. Speaking of rumors, we’ve also seen evidence that Yakuza 6: The Song of Life may be coming to PC at some point, based on one of their quarterly reports which listed the game as a PS4 and PC title. Nothing new on the console front, I’m afraid. I’m sure that more games that were previously PC-exclusive before getting ported to PS4 and/or the Xbox One have since received additional Switch ports (and vice versa), but that’s not really my scene.\n\nTop 5 Successes of 2018\n\nTime for my usual round of yearly bragging. This time around, three of my picks weren’t even on any previous lists in the first place – so I can’t even really take credit for them. Granted, two games were too old to fall under my criteria in the first place and are only coming to PC due to the creation of new remasters across multiple platforms and one of them was only released this year anyway. I guess if I were to pick an honorable mention, I’d give it to killer7, coming to us courtesy of Grasshopper Manufacture and NIS America (with Capcom’s blessing). Despite NISA’s history with PC ports – still waiting for actual confirmation that their Ys VIII port was legitimately fixed (as opposed to “I played 50 hours and it only crashed 15 times!”) – apparently this game turned out amazing, adding new features and opting for a silky smooth 60 FPS framerate.\n\n5. Ys: Memories of Celceta – Nihon Falcom/XSEED Games (PlayStation Vita)\n\nNothing against Celceta – it was a fun game and I’m glad it hit PC – but this probably would’ve ended up being higher if it didn’t feel like a foregone conclusion. Hyde Inc. definitely learned from their PC port of Ys Seven, as this game turned out looking amazing – easily becoming the definitive version of Falcom’s in-house take on the Ys IV legend.\n\n4. Metal Wolf Chaos XD – From Software/Devolver Digital (Xbox)\n\nThe former Japanese Xbox-exclusive where players take on the role of the President of the United States as he pilots a mech suit is finally coming out in America – and on modern platforms, no less. Devolver Digital had been showing interest in publishing the game since 2016 and an official announcement was the centerpiece of their E3 conference this year. It’s not due out until sometime next year, but the fact that it’s coming to PC makes it worth the wait.\n\n3. Onimusha: Warlords – Capcom (PlayStation 2, Xbox)\n\nI legitimately freaked out when I heard about this. All things considered, Onimusha was one of those cult classic Capcom franchises that seemed out of reach for legitimate reasons: specifically, the likeness rights of the actor who portrayed the main character, Samanosuke Akechi – who was modeled after and even voiced by Japanese/Taiwanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro. In fact, the only game that doesn’t have this issue is Dawn of Dreams, the unpopular fourth game and I’m sure that’s why we only have this first game, as opposed to a full-on HD collection. Regardless, I’ve got some good memories playing through this game one night with two of my buddies back in 8th Grade and I can’t wait to go through it again.\n\n2. Fighting EX Layer – ARIKA (PlayStation 4)\n\nI was originally going to put this on this year’s wishlist, as a sort of “gimme” game, simply because ARIKA had expressed interest in releasing FEXL at some point if it did well. I wasn’t even expecting an announcement on this until next year at the earliest, but ARIKA surprised me with a simple trailer on YouTube back in late September. Better still, they only plan on selling the “Full Version” – which includes fifteen Gougi decks (to the Light Version’s five) and Hokuto as an additional character – at $40, the Light Version’s price on PS4 Clearly the best of both worlds. While I likely won’t be able to grab this on day one – despite the generous 25% discount – I do hope to grab it before the end of this year.\n\n1. SEGA’s “Best in Japan” Line-Up at E3 2018\n\nIt couldn’t have been anything else. When I listed the Yakuza series on last year’s wishlist, I was honestly being flippant. I never would’ve guessed that Sega would’ve brought one of its big console exclusives to PC but here we are: Yakuza Zero’s already on Steam and Yakuza Kiwami has already been announced. On top of that, they also announced Valkyria Chronicles 4 would be coming to PC and reaffirmed recent releases, claiming that they were bringing “the best Japanese titles to PC”. Hopefully, we’ll see even more announcements next year.\n\n10 Broken/Delisted Games I Want on GOG\n\nThis is that new list I mentioned near the start of the article. While I’ll often extoll the virtues of a digital-only future for the PC platform, it’s not a perfect concept. We’ve seen various games removed from storefronts like Steam and GOG due to expired licenses, company closures and various other issues. Worse yet, there are games that are still available that are ridden with defunct DRM programs or worse, incompatible with modern operating systems. Of course, GOG will attempt to circumvent the technical issues of these games, with their re-release of Fallout 3 last year being a chief example. So why not pick 10 digital releases that are either gone or stagnant and point out that, in the end, they’re just some Good Old Games?\n\nStreet Fighter IV – Capcom\n\nI’ll be honest with you: SF4 was the game that inspired this list in the first place. Back when I was researching for that Street Fighter retrospective I spent the better part of this year on, I popped in the original home release of Street Fighter IV and had a pretty good time going back to it. These days, it’s more of a curiosity piece – especially due to its exclusive cinematics that didn’t appear in any other iteration of SF4 and its gallery mode – but certainly not worth the $20 Capcom is still asking for it on Steam. Just give it the Blazblue Calamity Trigger treatment: strip out the GfWL-powered online mode entirely and sell that sucker on Steam and GOG for $10, with 50% or higher sales on the regular.\n\nSpider-Man: Shattered Dimensions – Activision\n\nI’ll level with you: I’ve yet to play the recent Spider-Man game on PS4 and I’ve got my doubts that I’ll play it before the decade’s through. With that in mind, I feel confident in my assertion that Shattered Dimensions was the best Spider-Man game ever sold on Steam. It’s a shame that the PC port was only compatible with Windows XP and Vista – especially considering that it was on sale on Steam only a few years back. It’s been taken down again – that’s the problem with licensing agreements – but I’d love to see it come back, stripped of Games for Windows Live and able to run properly on modern Windows builds.\n\nOutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast – Sega\n\nWell, this one’s strictly a licensing issue: Sega clearly didn’t want to pony up to renegotiate their license with Ferrari. I’m still bummed out that I missed picking up this port – the OutRun games are some of my favorite racing driving games of all time – so obviously a straight-up re-release is all I really want here. Granted, the game might have some compatibility issues since it was released back in the days of Windows XP, but as far as I can tell (based on the PC Gaming Wiki), there don’t appear to be any compatibility issues on modern systems, which means that anyone smart enough to pick it up before its removal can still play it to this day.\n\nStubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse – Aspyr\n\nThis is one of those games from the sixth generation that I missed out on, but it looked interesting. I mean, zombie games are a dime a dozen, but a game where you take control of a zombie would be an original concept today, let alone today. It’s also got a sense of humor, which is also a plus for me. It was also apparently on Steam at one point – but it looks like it was taken down because it can’t run on modern hardware. So yeah, this is absolutely perfect for this list: maybe a GOG release will mean a complete removal of its SecuROM DRM.\n\nWolfenstein (2009) — id Software (Bethesda)\n\nApparently, the only reason this game has been taken down is because Bethesda – the current rightsholder for Wolfenstein and id Software’s other IPs – is ashamed of it. All I’ve got to say to that is that both versions of Doom 3 are still up for sale on Steam and the BFG Edition is up on GOG – so using “quality concerns” as an excuse is invalid. Frankly, I’d just want it as a curiosity piece more than out of sheer enjoyment. I mean, every other Wolfenstein game since 3D is available on digital storefronts in one form or another and I’ll never believe that the 2009 game was so much worse than every other game in the series.\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game – Atari\n\nI mean, I already own this game on Steam, so I can vouch for its quality. Granted, I think it was taken down in the first place to help boost sales of the 2016 game, which was apparently a slapdash cash-in on a box office bomb. And now that’s even down as well. Might as well allow audiences to enjoy the best Ghostbusters-related video game ever released in North America once again. There’s not even any way to implement the multiplayer from the console versions and I even played through the game on an OS no older than Windows 8.1, so it should be as simple as literally flipping a switch.\n\nDriver: San Francisco – Ubisoft\n\nI’ll be honest, I never really got into the Driver series that much – but I did like Burnout Paradise. Driver: San Francisco looks like a game made in a similar vein and given all of the good reviews I’ve seen regarding it – for both the console and PC versions, no less – it’s made me curious about the game’s quality. Unfortunately, it looks like the game may be bound by Ubisoft’s own proprietary DRM, Uplay: so the chances of the game hitting GOG are pretty low, even though it’s only available on Amazon as a digital download at the moment – and the reviews on there seem to imply that there are compatibility issues with Windows 7 and its successors.\n\nMortal Kombat Arcade Kollection – WB Games\n\nHey look, another game I already own on Steam! I’m not sure why WB took down this collection off of Steam – maybe because the online multiplayer was handled on Games for Windows Live – but even if it weren’t, it does offer something different from the current line of classic PC ports available on GOG. While that collection contains the original Mortal Kombat 3, a childhood favorite of mine, the Arcade Kollection has Ultimate MK3 – the much more popular version – instead. Granted, I think the best thing WB could do would be to just re-release it on Steam and GOG with improved online multiplayer – but just making it available to the masses again would be nice.\n\nMidnight Club II – Rockstar\n\nMan, I’ve got a real thing for racing games this time. Did you know that Rockstar used to make games that weren’t sprawling open-worlds? It’s true! From what I’ve heard about it and seen in gameplay footage, it seems like a pretty good arcade racing game – the type I like. Midnight Club II was apparently the only game in the series to receive a PC port, which makes it a prime candidate for re-release. Again, the issue stems from the age of the game – apparently this port’s so old, the non-Steam releases aren’t even stable on Windows Vista, let alone 10.\n\nNarco Terror – Deep Silver\n\nThis game actually came as a recommendation from my editor: while I wasn’t opposed to having two games from the same developer on this list, making it to nine without any repeats made me reluctant to resort to that. From what I’ve seen, Narco Terror is a twin-stick shooter inspired by top-down, free-movement shoot-‘em-ups like Ikari Warriors, Commando and Renegade Ops. It doesn’t necessarily have the best reviews, but that kind of pedigree makes it sound like an interesting game. I’d give it a shot if it resurfaces at a reasonable price. Besides, Deep Silver seems to be pretty chummy-chummy with GOG. I’m not sure why the game was removed from Steam in the first place – but Steam keys can still be bought on Amazon for some reason, so I’m not sure what problem there was with the game.\n\nThe Main Event\n\nWith those lists out of the way, it’s time for a fresh batch of PC port-related wishes. Before we begin, let’s recap the rules I’ve tried to keep since I started doing these lists a few years back. I’ve been sticking to the seventh (PS3/Xbox 360/Wii) and eighth (PS4/Xbox One/Wii U/Switch) video game console generations, as well as their portable counterparts. Porting anything else would likely require a remaster – like Onimusha and Katamari Damacy – and these lists are more about run-of-the-mill ports. I also generally limit myself to a single game per company, though given the sheer amount of mergers we’ve seen, I will often allow entries from wholly-owned subsidiaries and their parent companies in the same list. In other words, you could see entries from Sega and Atlus on the same list, but not Square Enix and its various divisions, except maybe Taito – Squenix seems to have given them a lot of headway. I generally consider a “series” an entry, so every game would be considered together, as long as all of the games fall into the console generations I’m covering. Last and certainly not least, I’ll be keeping this limited to third-parties and Microsoft – who seem to have gotten even better about putting the games I care about on PC. Asking for Nintendo and Sony first-party content is a waste of time, so don’t expect to see stuff like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or Marvel’s Spider-Man on this list. That being said, let’s get down to business.\n\nSpyro: Reignited Trilogy – Activision/Toys for Bob (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)\n\n…what? I always stack the deck in my favor whenever possible. We’ve already seen evidence hinting to the existence of both a PC and Switch version in development and while the game is currently exclusive to the HD Twins of PS4 and XBO, I’d much rather grab it on PC all things considered – especially after the whole debacle surrounding just how much of the content is actually on-disc. On the other hand, I worry I may not be able to spare the 67.455GB needed to download the game (on PS4, anyway) at this point. Either way, I liked what little I played of Spyro on the PlayStation 1 and would love to experience the rest of the original trilogy in full HD.\n\nSNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy – SNK/NIS America (PlayStation 4, Switch)\n\nSure, it’s another game where we’ve got at least minor evidence that a PC port could be in the works. I told you I don’t always play fair with these. In an E3 magazine special, it was mentioned that Abstraction Games handled the Switch version of SNK Heroines and the same write-up mentioned that they were working on a PC version as well. Considering they were the dev team behind The King of Fighters XIV, it only makes sense that they could be making a PC version of this game as well. Taking all that into consideration, I’ll assume that we’ll hear some kind of confirmation about SNK Gals’ Fighters’ spiritual successor hitting PC sometime next year.\n\nLunar: Silver Star Harmony – Game Arts/XSEED Games (PlayStation Portable)\n\nThis is usually the point in the list where I beg for yet another PC port of a Falcom console-exclusive. Alas, I’ve already exhausted all of their games that have been translated into English in recent history – and I’m not enough of a fool to suggest that anything besides the Japan-only Kiseki games receive even a passing glance by any translation company at this point. What’s an Icepick to do? Easy: dig up another XSEED translation of a game I’m fond of. Granted, I would obviously prefer seeing a re-release of the old PS1 version – because that’s “me nostalgia” – packed in with the original Sega CD version, but honestly: the PSP release is not only the newest release of the game, but it’s the only one I haven’t played at all – “Lunar Legend” was a mistake. Game Arts has mentioned interest in bringing more of their games to Steam and XSEED’s been doing a bang-up job of bringing their stuff to PC, so let’s just kill two birds with one stone.\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective – Capcom (DS, iOS)\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, I’ve got enough requests for Capcom games to keep them in the running for years to come – it’s just difficult to narrow down which one gets the nod each year. I almost considered putting Ace Attorney on this year’s list, but even before Capcom announced a re-release on every modern platform that matters, my gut went in a completely different direction. Ghost Trick is easily one of the most underappreciated games in the DS’s library and the fact that it’s only seen a re-release on iOS feels like a mystery not even Sissel and Lynne would be able to solve. Use the iPhone version as a base, add mouse support and improve the resolution and BAM! You’ll introduce another of Shu Takumi’s masterpieces to a much wider audience. Think of it as a well-deserved tribute to the late, great Missile.\n\nThe Legend of Dark Witch Episode 3: Wisdom and Lunacy – INSIDE SYSTEM/M2 (3DS)\n\nThis was honestly my first pick for this year’s list – a choice that was solidified when the game was first released on the 3DS last year. I’m fond of the first two Dark Witch games and would love to play the latest entry on my PC, even if its gameplay supposedly deviated significantly from previous titles. Considering the fact that the second RPG spinoff in the series, Brave Dungeon: Seigi no Imi, has already been confirmed to be releasing on PC via Steam next year, I like the odds that this game will hit the platform as well at some point. I just hope it’s sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Prinny Duology – Nippon Ichi Software (PlayStation Portable)\n\nPrinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? And Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood! were two of Nippon Ichi’s more interesting releases. Spun off from their popular Disgaea series, these games were actually platformers starring the series mascot in a similar vein to the Ghosts ‘n Goblins games of old, both in terms of platforming mechanics and apparently difficulty. It would be a shame to keep these games constrained to a handheld long gone like the PSP, especially when the PC is so enduring. I’ve honestly been wondering if NIS America bailed on releasing the rest of the older Disgaea games and just skipping straight due to issues with porting games from the Vita or because they just wanted to focus on their latest release. Well, the Prinny games don’t have either issue – NISA’s ported games from PSP before and there aren’t any more recent titles in the series to worry about – so they’d be a perfect choice for a new project.\n\n3D Dot Game Heroes – From Software/Silicon Studio/Atlus USA (PlayStation 3)\n\nMan, I’ve been holding onto this one for a while. 3D Dot Game Heroes is essentially a voxel-based version of classic action-RPGs, borrowing elements from Final Fantasy Adventure, The Legend of Zelda and even Dragon Warrior to create something both familiar and new. Best of all, the player character can be completely customized using the game’s 3D sprite editor. This is such a cool little game, it deserves a re-release on modern platforms and a PC port would probably be the easiest way to make that happen. Better yet, it would give Atlus USA a little needed cred among the PC gaming community, given their consistent failure to do anything with the platform besides publishing ACE Team’s games on Steam.\n\nSonic Colors – SEGA (Wii)\n\nTruth be told, before I decided to go all-out and ask Sega for the Yakuza series last year, I originally planned on asking for Sonic Colors. Colors is probably my favorite Boost-formula Sonic game – no small feat, given my general distaste with the mechanics in general – and I definitely think it deserves a release on modern platforms. Of course, many publications assumed that this port might already be in the cards, simply because promotional art from a Sonic-themed Steam sale included artwork from the DS version of Colors. Not necessarily the smoking gun I was hoping for, so I figure there’s no harm in asking Sega directly.\n\nMighty Gunvolt Burst (Gal*Gunvolt Burst) – Inti Creates (3DS, Switch, PlayStation 4)\n\nI feel like this might’ve been telegraphed with one of my choices last year. Either way, from what I’ve heard, Mighty Gunvolt Burst – rebranded as Gal*Gunvolt Burst when it was released on the PS4 – is the closest thing we’ll ever see to redemption for Mighty No. 9. As one of the thousands of people suckered into contributing to that second-rate MegaMan knockoff – even though I think the widespread response to it was overblown, to put it mildly – I’d love something resembling vindication on this front, particularly on my platform of choice. It doesn’t hurt that much like Gunvolt 2, we’ve already got the game’s direct predecessor on Steam as it is. So, come on Inti Creates, hook us up – you don’t even have the excuse of this game being a “Nintendo-only” thing, given its presence on the PS4.\n\nPersona series – Atlus (PlayStation 3/Portable/Vita/4)\n\nI’ll be honest: I struggled with this one. I almost opted out of doing listing this game this year for a couple of reasons. First, despite the fact that I do count Atlus and Sega as separate companies – despite the latter owning the former at this point – I just feel a little sketchy doing both in a single list, even if all but one of the games I’m even considering asking for here were made prior to that buyout. There’s also the fact that despite my (limited) success with Yakuza last year, I always worry about getting greedy with these.\n\nRegardless, I’ve seen my opportunity and I’m taking it, because that’s what heroes do. Atlus USA has recently undergone a bit of a reshuffling in terms of its corporate structure – with key figures at Sega America and Sega West taking over as President and CEO, respectively. Considering Sega’s own implied emphasis on PC as of late, not to mention the fact that both Yakuza and Persona were on “that list of games Sega wants to bring to PC” and Atlus USA’s downright impotent acknowledgement that PC gamers wanted to play Persona 5 after trying to shut down a PS3 emulator, I think this could go either way. Still, if it happens sometime next year (or later, I’m not picky), I wouldn’t mind being able to claim at least a modicum of credit for it coming to pass.\n\nSince I’ve only played the original English release of Revelations: Persona, I’d love to see Atlus start with an upscaled port of its PSP remake, if only so I can play through the Snow Queen quest at some point. I’d be willing to guess that Atlus would probably just end up starting with Persona 5 though. As for other games I’d want, I’d like to see PC ports of both Persona 2 remakes on PSP – with Eternal Punishment receiving a new English translation, obviously – Persona 3 Portable (with the additional content from FES, if possible) and Persona 4 Golden. I guess I’d also like to see their fighting game spinoff Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, but I’m sure Arc System Works would be willing to handle that with Atlus’s blessing.\n\nTop 10 Most Wanted\n\nI’ll be honest with you, I almost considered dropping this list, at least for this year. After all, only one of last year’s entries – Ys: Memories of Celceta, the former number one – managed to come to pass. However, upon further reflection, I decided a reshuffle was worth the effort anyway. A few other entries from previous years have been dropped from consideration for various reasons – something I probably should’ve considered doing last year anyway – and I decided to look into other older lists to replace them. As with last year, I’ve decided to rank them not only based on how much I want them, but also on how realistic I think it is that they might receive some form of a PC port in the near future. Here’s hoping next year’s list changes even more – for the happiest of reasons, of course!\n\n10. Splatterhouse (2010) – Bandai Namco (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)\n\nConsidering this went from number 3 last year all the way down to the bottom spot, you’re probably assuming that I’ve fallen out of love with the 2010 reboot of Splatterhouse. Valid guess, but it’s more like I just think it’s become less likely of a port as of late. Maybe in 2020 – the game’s tenth anniversary – things will change, but for now, I just don’t see Bandai Namco revisiting this game. I mean, Katamari Damacy was a popular game but considering the last we’ve heard of Splatterhouse was as an understated part of the Namco Museum on Switch and that was last year, I don’t like the odds.\n\n9. Dragon’s Crown Pro – Atlus/Vanillaware (PlayStation 4/3/Vita)\n\nI’m not saying it’s impossible, but I think the critical moment to get a Dragon’s Crown PC port has passed, especially given Vanillaware’s lack of a partner willing to port games to the platform, not to mention the fact that development on 13 Sentinels, their next title, seems to be swinging into full gear. I’ll keep the faith alive but I’m not expecting this any time soon.\n\n8. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 – Bandai Namco (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U)\n\nYou could easily argue that Tekken 7’s continued success will probably kill any chance of a TTT2 re-release anywhere, but honestly, who can really say? Tekken’s one of Namco’s big series, so I guess I could see some kind of a revival – after all, they did a re-release of the original Tekken Tag on PS3 years back to help promote a Tekken animated film. I doubt it’ll happen until Tekken 7’s done receiving new content and considering its second season just started and it reached another sales milestone, that might be a ways away.\n\n7. Catherine: Full Body – Atlus (PlayStation 4/Vita)\n\nThis is probably the largest jump forward of any of the games from last year and it’s due to a number of factors. Aside from the shift in Atlus USA’s leadership I mentioned previously, there’s the fact that a new version of the game was announced altogether, one that Atlus USA confirmed would be making its way to the West but offering no other details, particularly which platforms it would appear on. Since then, Sony’s begun censoring some of their racier titles after moving their headquarters to California – even ones that aren’t intended for the Western market, which has led to some pushback from both Japanese developers and fans. Worries began to surface over Catherine: Full Body receiving a similar treatment, something which wasn’t assuaged by Atlus’s recent response to these new policies. I’m not sure if all of these factors will finally put Atlus over the edge, but here’s hoping.\n\n6. Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix – Capcom (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)\n\nHuh, this one is in the same exact spot as it was last year. I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same. While the death of the Puzzle Fighter mobile game could have positive or negative repercussions regarding a re-release of the seventh-gen HD version, Capcom does seem to be on a roll when it comes to re-releasing their older titles in general. Of course, that could mean a straight release of the latest release of the original game, but I think it’s equally possible that we could see some other releases. I’d personally champion an “Ultra Puzzle Fighter” which would combine elements from all previous releases: the Street Puzzle Mode from the PS1/Saturn version and its various unlockable bonuses, the “X/Y/Z” game modes present in the Dreamcast and HD Remix versions and the ability to choose between the classic 2D sprites (with various filters) and the redrawn graphics from the latest release. On the other hand, they might also do a compilation package similar to their Beat-‘Em-Up Bundle, packaging the original arcade release with various other arcade games that could be considered “puzzle games”. I guess as long as I’m able to play Puzzle Fighter online with friends on PC, I’ll be happy.\n\n5. NeoGeo Battle Coliseum – SNK (Xbox 360)\n\nI guess something similar could be said for NGBC, which jumps ahead two spots from last year. SNK has been focusing on a single new game at a time but reinforcing their finances with various re-releases. We’ve got the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection on Switch handling the pre-NeoGeo era and the various NeoGeo Mini consoles representing their Golden Age, but we’ve still got a significant lack of their games from the Playmore era at hand. Given the rumblings of a NGBC2 being a potential project after Samurai Shodown and the all but inevitable King of Fighters XV, it would only make sense to re-release the original game, just to remind people how awesome it was.\n\n4. Cyber Troopers Virtual-On/Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram/Virtual-On Force – Sega (Xbox 360, PlayStation 4/3)\n\nOh wow, our first legitimately new title! Ironically, Sega recently announced that these three games – the exact three games I requested from the Xbox 360 way back when – would be making their way to the PlayStation 4 in Japan very recently. That makes them even more primed and ready for port-begging. We don’t have any details about a Western release at this point, which is why they end up so low on the list, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a one-year wonder on the cumulative list. I wonder if those crowdfunded controllers that recreate the classic Virtual-On control scheme will work on PC…\n\n3. Rare Replay – Microsoft Studios/Rare (Xbox One)\n\nThe hits just keep on coming. With Sunset Overdrive having just made its way to PC, this is the only Xbox One exclusive I still want – well, aside from Super Ultra Dead Rising 3′ Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + α, but I don’t think Capcom even remembers that spinoff. A collection of some of the best games from Rare’s halcyon days, lovingly recreated on modern platforms? Yes please. This would even manage to kill three birds with one stone, considering how I requested the Xbox 360 versions of the Banjo-Kazooie games way back when, and that’s just a fraction of what Rare Replay has to offer.\n\n2. Brandish: The Dark Revenant – Nihon Falcom/XSEED Games (PlayStation Portable)\n\nI mean, you kind of had to be expecting this. With all of the modern Ys games available on Steam, I was clearly going to branch out into XSEED’s other Falcom offerings. Fortunately, most of those have either already been ported to PC or are just essentially exclusively available on the platform at the moment. The only game they’re holding back from me would be the 2009 remake of the original Brandish on the PSP, which XSEED localized back in… 2015? Strictly a digital-only release, it’s a shame that this game didn’t get more love, especially considering how the translation was literally a labor of love by Tom “Wyrdwad” Lipschultz. This would probably have ranked at #1 – given Falcom’s emphasis on releasing their games on PC – but with Tom leaving XSEED, I’m not so sure it’s a slam dunk anymore.\n\n1. MegaMan Powered Up/MegaMan: Maverick Hunter X – Capcom (PlayStation Portable)\n\nThese two are literally the perfect storm. We’ll be celebrating another MegaMan milestone this December – MegaMan X’s 25th anniversary, which has its own logo and everything – Capcom’s been knocking it out of the park with re-releases (even games like Onimusha that I’d long given up on seeing again in a legitimate form) and MegaMan managed to rack up another 2 million franchise-wide sales as of late. Honestly, I’d say more, but since I’ll be discussing this concept in-depth later in the month, I’ll just hold my tongue for now. I’ve had a pretty good track record with my number one picks on these cumulative lists, so here’s hoping for a three-peat.\n\nAnd with that, my itch to talk about PC ports has been sufficiently scratched. Here’s hoping that I get enough announcements in the next four months to overshadow my next list – my traditional April Fools’ tradition of mentioning PC games that should be ported to consoles. I’ve nearly got that list completely planned out as it is.\n\nI’ll be honest: I did originally dismiss the idea of doing a Retrospective on the Street Fighter series back when I looked over Tekken last year. The thing is, after the Classic MegaMan article ended up being split into multiple parts, any excuse I had for not writing about Street Fighter evaporated. This series isn’t necessarily going to be as prominent as the other Retrospectives have been. I plan to mainly just write these whenever I’m not writing something else, so they’ll trickle out infrequently. Still, considering the fact that Capcom will be releasing a Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection this May – featuring a whopping 12 games – now seems as good a time as any to do a wistful look back at one of Capcom’s most enduring franchises. The only limits I’m putting on this series of retrospective articles is that I will be sticking mostly to Street Fighter games that managed to see Western release. Granted, most games in the series came out here, but there are a few rarities that were Japan-exclusive.\n\nThe thing is, I owe a lot of my interest in video games to Street Fighter. The 2D fighting game genre is among my favorites across the entirety of mass media, and like a majority of the children of the ‘90s, that love stemmed from the first time I played a Street Fighter game. In my case, the first game I played was the original version of Street Fighter II for the Super NES at my cousin’s house when I was around 5 or 6 years old. Another cousin had the Special Champion Edition on the Sega Genesis and eventually, that first cousin would obtain a copy of Street Fighter II Turbo for the SNES as well. I became enamored with the game, almost to the point of obsession and I was incredibly happy when I was finally able to own a version of the game of my very own. Of course, that was the IBM-PC version, which was a complete train wreck, but you try telling that to a happy child. Not long after, I finally had a legitimate home version of my very own: Super Street Fighter II for the Sega Genesis. While Street Fighter is probably no longer one of my favorite fighting game series, it still occupies a "
