        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nKhamsin\n\n65%NES\n\n2h 7m Played\n\nI don't know if this was the case everywhere in the West (or even in Europe), but in France, Double Dragon has the amusing distinction of having been released after Double Dragon II. Well, not that amusing actually, since this made it difficult to appreciate at the time as it was an obvious stepback for the players (which, in fact, was just pure logic). In hindsight, it was a really good game for its time, despite major gameplay flaws (notably the fact of clearly having been designed for co-op). Try it if you're curious, just keep in mind that DDII is much better.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nJayce\n\n70%Game Boy\n\n34m Played\n\nA solid conversion of the NES version of the arcade classic (what a mouthful!). Double Dragon on Game Boy features impressive graphics for an early Game Boy release, and a mostly intact soundtrack. The game wisely eschews the RPG mechanics of the NES version for a more bite-sized experience befitting the little handheld, while also walking back some of the more difficult platforming challenges introduced in its console counterpart. The result is a version of Double Dragon that feels almost like a mix between the arcade original and the NES game, providing a pure arcade brawler without relying on the quartermunching of the actual coin-up machine. The number of enemies on screen is still limited to two at a time, but this actually makes the game a far more pleasant experience than it would have been otherwise - doubly so considering the Game Boy's limited screen real-estate. It also benefits from the more deliberate nature of the game, making screen-blurring much less of an issue than in most other action-oriented Game Boy games of its vintage. Combine these characteristics with good hit detection, and a tough but fair challenge level, and the end result is an early Game Boy classic that has aged remarkably well, and remains fun and highly playable today.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nExhuminator\n\n80%Arcade\n\n25m Played\n\nTitle: Double Dragon\n\nPlatform: Arcade\n\nRegion release played: USA\n\nYear of release: 1987\n\nDeveloper: Technōs Japan\n\nPublisher: Taito\n\nGraphics: 4/5\n\nAudio: 3/5\n\nChallenge: 4/5\n\nFun factor: 4/5\n\nQuick Thoughts: Double Dragon is a 2D beat 'em up that begin as a sequel within the Kunio-kun series. Double Dragon became its own game however, introducing concepts like continuous side-scrolling stages, two-player cooperative play, the ability to take and use weapons from enemies, cut scenes to provide a cinematic feel, and other innovations that became genre staples. Double Dragon's title is a reference to the two-player gameplay combined with Bruce Lee's film Enter the Dragon. Double Dragon was immensely popular in its day, both critically and commercially, thus was ported to, and remade for, many different platforms. In my opinion, some of the ports are funner than the arcade original, but the original DD deserves credit for starting the golden age of the beat 'em up genre.\n\n+For 1987 DD was a true evolution of the beat 'em up genre.\n\n+Strong graphic design.\n\n+Interesting and varied level designs.\n\n+Two player mode is always fun.\n\n+That machine gun is no match for this aluminum bat.\n\n-Serious slowdown issues.\n\n-Difficulty is statically balanced for two players.\n\n-Enemies constantly get hit preference.\n\n-Outside the iconic theme song, the other music tracks are blah.\n\n-The slippery precipices seem to have their own gravity.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nRickyButler\n\n70%NES\n\n40m Played\n\n6.5 rounded up.\n\nIt's a fine beatemup, but lacks some of the bells and whistles of later games in the genre. It's a bit easier than most (mostly...) games of its era, too, and is over before it gets off the ground at about 40 minutes. The combat isn't a s neat as Tecnos' best games, and most encounters can be cheesed once you learn the right move (*ahem*...throw that elbow behind you).\n\nShareCompleted\n\nCitrusFury\n\n70%Nintendo Switch\n\nDouble Dragon is a classic brawler that I've known about for years before actually playing it. I played it on the Switch and abused save states and the rewind feature, because frankly it's a pretty brutally hard game (like most NES games). You only get three lives to get through the entirety of the game, and while you do heal up between areas and you have a solid amount of health, certain enemies really lay the smackdown on you.\n\nThe graphics are pretty solid for an NES game, and there's a good amount of enemy and level variety, as well as a few weapon pickups. Your moveset increases as you play, which is cool and kind of forward-thinking for the time, but also a bit weird since the game is so short. Once you unlock all your moves, you can do punch and kick combos, a flying kick, a headbutt, a head grab & kick into a backwards throw, and even beat enemies up while they're on the ground. Pretty impressive moveset for an NES game. The music is also very good, and keeps up the energy.\n\nUnfortunately the game is brutally hard, as I say, and there are a few encounters and traps that feel pretty unfair. In particular there is a wall of stone slabs late in the game that push out in a fast and seemingly random manner, which do a lot of damage and are very hard to avoid. The enemy/boss rush at the end is also very tough. If I was trying to play without save states I would have found it a lot more frustrating.\n\nDouble Dragon is a classic, cliché game of \"beat up the bad guys with your kung fu to save your girlfriend.\" It's not perfect, but it's still a lot of fun. I'd play with save states unless you're serious about mastering the game, but it's a fun old school action game either way.\n\nActual Score: 7.5/10"
