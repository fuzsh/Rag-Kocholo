        "text": "Well, i appreciate your good intentions but thatâs the thing, in OpenBOR itâs not possible for someone creating a âpatchâ which people can download and just âinstall â it to the game themselves like you described. Thatâs not how OpenBOR works unfortunately.\n\nSo the only option is for the 5.1.1 version to be edited and shared allover again. With which iâm not interested on helping. And yes OpenBOR is about sharing things but that has nothing to do with it. Me helping everyone updating my game with his own personal ideas and stuff would be the craziest thing for me or any creator to do. Just think about that if you were me.\n\nSorry man but you can play with linda on your edited version and be happy with it. As about sharing, sure you can still share your work with me and the maybe in the future i might include some of your stuff if iâm ever gonna update the game again.\n\nAlso by the way, sharing is what i already did. I already did share my 5 years of work with this game which you were able to play and edit. So since you are all about sharing, you can also share your sprites on the chronocrash forum so other creators can use them on their dd projects. Thatâs an idea too.\n\nOne more last thing, people calling their own personal edits for their own taste on a game âfixesâ, is the most irritating thing for most creators including me. Just saying..\n\nI'm a mod maker myself, so I get your frustrations, mate.\n\nWhen I say a \"patch\", I mean actually that. A literal patch difference file made with something like xdelta that requires the player to download your game, and my \"patch\" file, and then run an executable that \"combines\" the two on their own computer. Think of how NES romhacks work. It's how many folks get around modding commercial games where there is no existing mod tools so we don't have to distribute the whole game illegally. With a patch like this, you're not redistributing edited versions of the game. It makes the player do an extra step and is more work for the modder, but it doesn't step on toes of creators by redistributing their entire games.\n\nI also appreciate how busy you are, and have managed to figure out most of the issues I was having myself. I was only asking, and certainly don't expect you to help every modder who asks.\n\nThe last point, the only time I said \"fix\" was involving an actual error in the original DD sprites (red around Williams' face), not something you did, and the fact that Abobo is named differently. Obviously personal choice stuff like changing a special move or adding ED-209 like someone else did isn't a \"fix\"! LOL!"
