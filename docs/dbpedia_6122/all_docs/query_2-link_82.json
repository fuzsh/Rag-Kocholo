        "text": "Strange that its part 1 of a Technos collection, but includes Double Dragon II instead of the original game.\n\nI think Evercade has done this before though, where the original game in a series comes in a later edition.\n\nPersonally, Double Dragon 2 arcade was a disappointment. I enjoy the first one still. The second one felt less balanced(aside from the elbow smash in the first game, which I try not to use much), and had major performance issues. The home ports were more fun for me. The NES version is pretty good and one of the best beat-em-up games on the system, probably. The PC Engine version is my favorite version of Double Dragon 2 and the best version in my opinion.\n\nI've heard ARCADE Double Dragon II isn't that good. It's the NES Double Dragon II that is considered the definitive version.\n\nAlso, I've heard the Japanese version of Double Dragon III is just slightly less terrible than the English version if because it wasn't designed around microtransactions (well, true, that's less of a concern in a compilation with infinite virtual coins but that's kind of the challenge of these arcade. To try to win without just spamming the coin button.)\n\nI've owned this cartridge since day one and I have to say -maybe it's my personal bias- that I enjoy discovering games that otherwise would be unknown to me. For me this is the beauty of the Evercade: a mix of well known gems and less known (and probably less good) games. And this cart delivers. Minky Monkey, for example, is a little addictive game in the vein of Donkey Kong Jr.\n\nAbout Double Dragon: I also like the first one better, and feel like II is like an enhanced version of the first game, even recycling two stages, so it's not new enough to me. The third part is pretty awful. Aside from the microtransactions gimmick, the visuals, animations and story are far worse in my opinion.\n\nI haven't played any Double Dragon on console yet, but people say DDII on the NES is top and III a little better than its arcade counterpart.\n\n@Moroboshi876 Have you tried Double Dragon Advance? It's an outstanding scrolling beat 'em up that is one of my favourites within the genre, was also recently released as a digital game on Switch and other platforms, so finally more widely available. It never had an EU release at the time so I had to import a US copy.\n\nThe first two arcade games are pretty dated now, though I remember the first one really impressed me when I saw the arcade back in the 80s. Then I made the mistake of buying the C64 version.\n\nCombatribes is an interesting one, the recently released Double Dragon Gaiden almost reminded me more of that game."
