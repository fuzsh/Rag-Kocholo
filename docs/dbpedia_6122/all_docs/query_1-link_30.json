        "text": "When you have a side-scrolling beat-em-up game like Streets of Rage, then fighting enemies vertically instead of horizontally would have a number of drawbacks:\n\nWhile it is easy for the player to see the range of attacks when they are performed horizontally (assuming hitboxes and hurtboxes match the animation), the attack ranges of vertical attacks are a lot harder to judge due to lack of depth perception.\n\nEither the player-character overlaps the enemy or the enemy overlaps the player-character. This hides information. Either the player can't properly see the tells of the enemy, or they can not properly see what their character is doing. The whole game gets a lot more chaotic, and the game screen gets harder to read for the player.\n\nIt just doesn't look as good. It is far easier to animate a good looking attack animation from the side than one from the front or back. Even walk cycles usually look a lot better from the side than from the front or back.\n\nFor those reasons, many side-scrolling beat-em-ups just disable vertical attacking, which forces players and AI enemies to engage each other from the side.\n\nMost of those problems can be solved by moving the camera angle to be from further up (like in Zelda) or even straight from the top (like in Hotline Miami). But while such a perspective has advantages for the gameplay, it has disadvantages for the aesthetics. The further up you move your camera, the less character detail is visible. In the overhead view, you reduce the character to their hair and shoulders, which does not have a lot of appeal. Also, while moving the camera up improves the viability of walking and attacking in 4 directions, you lose an equal amount of viability for gameplay centered around jumping, falling or climbing.\n\nThis is mostly to keep the gameplay simplified. There is simply too little added value for the complexity it adds to the player experience.\n\nThe challenges in these games are of course also calibrated to not confront you with this disability.\n\nIn addition, more modern games may also consciously do it to evoke nostalgia by directly copying how the game used to work in the arcade.\n\nWhile others have given excellent answers regarding visual clarity, art resources, and gameplay complexity, I'll add that a major reason is that I haven't seen explicitly stated, though it has perhaps been assumed, is that the Beat 'em Up genre includes side-scrolling as part of its definition.\n\nDoing a Beat 'em Up in 3D has another name. Either they're a \"Spectacle Fighter\" or a \"Hack and Slash\" game or possibly the extremely non-specific \"Action\" label gets involved.\n\nBut really, what are the essential parts of being a Beat 'em Up? While I'm not aware of a formal definition, I'd suggest that if the side-scrolling gameplay isn't part of the definition we typically have the following attributes:\n\nThe game is primarily based on fighting enemies in real time by controlling a single character.\n\nThe presence of enemies typically prevents the player from moving forward. Classically the screen mysteriously stops scrolling, but there could be locking doors or some other mechanism.\n\nUsually multiple enemies will appear at a time.\n\nSometimes defeating a wave of enemies will cause even more to appear before the player can leave.\n\nProgression is mostly linear.\n\nThe player most likely has at least a few different attacks, probably including a ground combo that's performed by repeatedly hitting the same attack button, and a jumping attack.\n\nOf course, genre definitions are a difficult thing and even classic Beat 'em Ups aren't perfectly rigid on these. To take examples from Battletoads: Turbo Tunnel, Clinger Wingers, and that part where you jump on snakes all are very different from typical Beat 'em Up gameplay.\n\nKeeping all this in mind, you could see Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Darksiders, and God of War games as Beat 'em Ups on at least some level. There are lots of examples of \"Beat 'em Up-ish\" games that don't include retro Beat 'em Up conventions, but then they don't look like retro Beat 'em Ups."
