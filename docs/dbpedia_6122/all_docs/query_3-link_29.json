        "text": "ALIEN vs. PREDATOR\n\nCapcom; Released 1994\n\nTechnically an early draft of a cross-over film about the battle of intergalactic races on Earth (which was not completed or shown until 10 years later), Alien vs. Predator was one of Capcom's innovative beat-'em-ups. Up to 3 players can choose from 2 cyborg marines and 2 Predators to destroy the Alien outbreak, only to discover later that humans are behind the plot of using the Xenomorphs as biological weapons. With a huge assortment of armaments and massive melee fighting, Alien vs. Predator pits players with the formidable Alien Queen as well as a new beat-'em-up gaming experience.\n\nALTERED BEAST aka JUOKI\n\nSega; Released 1988\n\nLocated in Ancient Greece, Zeus resurrects a deceased centurion to rescue his daughter Athena from the hands of the sorcerer Neff. These soldiers can turn into beasts such as the werewolf with the use of spirit orbs left behind by mythological dogs. Each power-up will bulk up the soldier's physique and the third one transforms him into one of the beasts, unique to each level which also allows him to face that stage boss. There are five distinct levels in order to reach the ultimate conflict with the sorcerer and rescue Athena. The game is notable for having a twist ending for its time. The game became a loose predecessor of Golden Axe, being spearheaded by the designer Makoto Uchida.\n\nARMORED WARRIORS aka\n\nPOWERED GEAR: STRATEGIC VARIANT ARMOR EQUIPMENT\n\nCapcom; Released 1994\n\nCapcom goes mechanical with this robot-inspired beat-'em-up. Pilot the standard type Blodia, speed type Reptos, output type Guldin and mobile type Fordy into 7 missions across Earth and the planet Raia. The Variant Armors can be customized with a variety of arm and leg parts that drop from defeated enemies and can be used to turn the tide of battle! This game spawned the fighting game sequel Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness in 1995, where Jin Saotome of Marvel vs. Capcom fame originated. Only multiplayer games can the ultimate warriors be utilized!\n\nASTERIX\n\nKonami; Released 1992\n\nBased from Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's bestselling French comics Asterix and Obelix, featuring the eponymous characters as Gaul warriors who fight the Roman Empire. Two players portray the diminutive Asterix and the gigantic Obelix, each with their unique attacks and animations in order to defeat incoming Roman soldiers. They can use spinning arms to punch a target with devastating effects, and they can also pick up a floored enemy for further throws.\n\nBAD DUDES vs. DRAGONNINJA aka DRAGON NINJA\n\nData East; Released 1988\n\nSet in Washington DC, the plot kicks in as President Ronnie of the United States has been kidnapped by the devious Dragonninja and his army of masked assassins. It is up to two street fighting guys Blade and Striker to use their butt-kicking skills to the test against various types of ninja. Knives and nunchaku are also available to whack these ninjas into oblivion. Being a Data East game, the cameo of Karnov is unsurprisingly obligatory, where he appears at various parts of the game as a boss character. The game was famous for its memetic tagline \"Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?\" and had a few spinoffs after Data East's demise.\n\nBATTLE CIRCUIT\n\nCapcom; Released 1997\n\nThe year 1997 saw the last Capcom arcade beat-'em-up and it is also a sci-fi themed game in the vein of Captain Commando with a twist of computerware. Most of the characters are either cyborgs, futuristic enemies and one even being a wannabe Elvis Presley. Up to 4 players can select from 5 bounty hunters, each with a specific party-boosting ability: balanced Cyber Blue (offense), agile Yellow Iris (agility), stretchy Captain Silver (defense), levitating Pink Ostrich (criticals) and brutish Alien Green (health). Throughout the stages, players earn coins by defeating enemies which in turn are used to purchase move upgrades after each stage. This game boasted a massive arsenal of individual character movesets.\n\nBATTLETOADS aka SUPER BATTLETOADS\n\nRare/Electronic Arts; Released 1994\n\nThis iteration of the Battletoads was known to have a more mature, dark and gory atmosphere compared to the light, toilet humor-based console games before it. Rash, Zitz and Pimple are sent in an all-out brawlin' to take down the Dark Queen's army, with a shoot-em-up level as the final confrontation. Each of the Battletoads have unique specialties, and they can mutilate enemies like sewer rats in bloody decapitating finishers. The fast and furious content of the game along with its violence level set it apart to other games with a similar yet softer approach to the genre.\n\nBURNING FIGHT\n\nSNK; Released 1991\n\nSNK's version of the famous Final Fight formula, three detectives are sent in Osaka where the mob boss Casterora had his grip of the streets, thanks to his gangster lackeys and members of the Yakuza. Two players can select from the balanced Duke Edwards, agile Ryu Saeba and heavy-hitter Billy King. The game has interactive rooms of breakables that produce score and energy items. It also references familiar wrestlers of the time, along with a call on the manga City Hunter's protagonist named Ryu Saeba. The game also has an expanded arsenal of usable weapons, including staffs and sticks of dynamite.\n\nCADILLACS AND DINOSAURS aka CADILLACS KYOURYUU-SHINSEIKI\n\nCapcom; Released 1993\n\nBased on Mark Schultz's Xenozoic Tales comic series, up to 3 people can play as the balanced Jack, item-skilled bombshell Hannah, swift Mustapha and brute-strong Mess into circa 2513 A.D., an age where humans and dinosaurs co-exist. Black market poachers are skinning dinosaur hide for extorsive prices. As players beat-up, shoot and drive across the stages, they discover a deeper plot of mutating humans into dinosaurs and the man behind it is the mad scientist Dr. Simon Fessenden! Players can use a huge arsenal of firearms and melee weapons throughout the game, with a stage dedicated to the eponymous Cadillac, the moving fortress!\n\nCAPTAIN AMERICA AND THE AVENGERS\n\nData East; Released 1989\n\nStraight from the popular Marvel Comics superhero team Avengers, four people can choose from Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Vision to save Earth from the Masters of Evil headed by the diabolical Red Skull. Players must defeat hordes of robotic grunts in order to face both obscure and familiar villains in the Marvel universe. Furthermore, certain members of the Avengers can join in the action to provide temporary assistance. Go forth with their adventures in land, water, air and into the depths of space to destroy a dangerous laser cannon that threatens Earth's existence and put an end to the Red Skull once and for all!\n\nCAPTAIN COMMANDO\n\nCapcom; Released 1991\n\nCaptain Commando is a game with a futuristic sci-fi theme wherein up to 4 people can play as the good psychos who must defeat the army of bio-engineered mutants and cyber criminals in Metro City (same as Final Fight, but circa 2026 AD!) and whisk into space to Planet Callisto, to send the mad genetic engineer Scumocide into oblivion. The bizarre commando team includes the Captain, the Bushinryu ninja Ginzu, alien mummy Mack and infant genius Baby Head on his own mech. Even though this game did not attain the fame of Final Fight, the Captain became Capcom's mascot and his team makes a cameo in 1998's Marvel vs. Capcom.\n\nCRIME FIGHTERS\n\nKonami; Released 1989\n\nOne of Konami's earliest beat-em-ups, up to four players portray undercover police officers who must rescue kidnapped girls from a crimelord. Similar to the earlier arcade hit Gauntlet, players' health slowly tick away as elapsed time, and there is also friendly fire amongst the heroes. The two-player version stuck to the more simple health system of Double Dragon. Players can also perform a coup de grace to strike floored enemies and steal their weapons. A notable feature of the game involves the apparent final boss battle and the actual fight that follows afterward. Konami produced spiritual successors to this game with Vendetta and Violent Storm.\n\nTHE COMBATRIBES\n\nTechnos; Released 1990\n\nUp to three people can portray the eponymous Combatribes: the balanced Berserker, the powerful Bullova and the nimble Blitz. Each hero has various attack abilities and all of them are strong enough to toss heavy items to decimate crowds of enemies. The players must brave through several acts while facing a thematic gang for each one, culminating a fight with the gang's boss. Similar to Technos' Renegade, the areas must be cleared first in order to face the boss. The game is also notable for a twist regarding the final boss battle.\n\nCROSSED SWORDS\n\nAlpha Denshi/SNK; Released 1990\n\nSimilar to The Super Spy, the game turns players into knights of journey travelling through the lands of Belkana in a medieval fantasy setting. Villages and castles have been attacked by the dark armies of the demon lord Nausizz. Employing a first-person view through wireframes, the game delves into the art of fencing with strategic defend and slash tactics. Maximum health increases as players gain experience in monster-slaying in an RPG leveling-up system. Stronger knights and creatures are encountered as the plot progresses, where powerful blades become available from a nomad merchant. It also spawned a Neo-Geo CD exclusive sequel that used a character class system.\n\nDENJIN MAKAI\n\nWinky Soft/Banpresto; Released 1994\n\nTwo people can play simultaneously in this futuristic beat-em-up. Choosing from six unique characters, players can use special attacks against the enemies through an energy gauge. Like the tradition of most beat-em-ups, characters can jump and attack, while in multiplayer, the heroes can perform team-up attacks to take down enemies. There's also a various arsenal of weapons and moves that can be used against the opposition. Select from Makai, Iyo, Belva, Kurokishi, Zeldia and Tarukusu to bring down a gang of cybernetic hoodlums!\n\nDOUBLE DRAGON\n\nTechnos/Taito; Released 1987\n\nTechnos' spiritual successor to Renegade spawned the quest of the Lee brothers to fight the Black Warriors as a homage to the film Enter the Dragon. Double Dragon proved to be as popular by itself with similar controls but very engaging gameplay. Another founding element of the beat-em-up genre is the usage of various items like oil drums and weapons like knives as usable equipment for players and enemy characters alike. Double Dragon's climactic last area had unique environment obstacles and the battle with the big boss made it a very memorable fight, the basis of the creation of various sequels, comics and animated series.\n\nDOUBLE DRAGON II THE REVENGE\n\nTechnos; Released 1988\n\nThe direct sequel of the first game takes plot narration to the grim side as Willy kills the love interest Marian right at the start of the game, prompting the brothers to step out again to exact revenge. The Lee twins' martial arts arsenal have also expanded, and so does the enemy roster and new weapons. The map layout of the sequel is very much like its predecessor, every close fight's interactivity like one involving a threshing vehicle, made gameplay even more intense. As one final twist, what dark force awaits the brothers along with the Black Warriors?\n\nDUNGEONS & DRAGONS: TOWER OF DOOM\n\nCapcom; Released 1993\n\nCapcom made a boardgame-to-arcade classic based on world-famous RPG Dungeons & Dragons, with real-life Dungeon Master Alex Jimenez behind the game. Up to 4 players can cooperatively play as the combat-oriented Fighter and Dwarf, or spellcasters Cleric and Elf. They must employ different strategies in order to survive their trek across the Republic of Darokin, against a great red wyrm and a formidable evil lich! Players experience the RPG elements of the board game with references to attack rolls, saving throws and many more. Its popularity and sequel hook made a new installment come into fruition.\n\nDUNGEONS & DRAGONS: SHADOW OVER MYSTARA\n\nCapcom; Released 1996\n\nThe official sequel of Tower of Doom, also headed by Alex Jimenez, Capcom expanded the campaign by adding two new classes: the frail Magicuser wields a vast array of spells more devastating than the Elf's, while the Thief has stealth skills and trap detection. The fact that players can choose from branching paths, alternate player designs and spellbooks, the acquisition of class weapons and items, a huge assortment of spells, class movesets and endless replayability made it one of Capcom's best and most memorable amongst the arcade beat-'em-ups. Defeat the Sorceress Synn and her Four Grand Masters!\n\nDUNGEON MAGIC aka LIGHTBRINGER\n\nTaito; Released 1991\n\nTaito's take on the medieval-fantasy RPG genre follows four heroes in their quest to stop an evil magician's plot in sacrificing the kidnapped princess to revive an ancient demon lord. The adventure takes place in an isometric view, where Ash the knight, Cisty the elven archer, Gren the roving warrior, and Vold the wizard then enter rooms of monsters and puzzles in a dungeon crawler theme. True to the genre, the enemies are mythical and fantastical creatures and rooms can be filled with traps or hoards of treasure. The heroes gain experience to level-up and must find upgrades to their unique weaponry. The choice of various routes provides players with endless replayability.\n\nDYNASTY WARS aka TENCHI WO KURAU\n\nCapcom; Released 1989\n\nAside from Koei's Sangokushi and Dynasty Warriors series, there was Capcom's! A beat-'em-up was released based on the manga Tenchi Wo Kurau, in turn based from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Up to 2 players can choose from 4 Chinese generals to stop the rebelling hordes of the Han Dynasty called the Huang Ching, a reference to the Yellow Turban Rebellion. It is one of the rare games wherein players trek through battlefields on horseback with various polearms to sweep through enemies. The game later spawned a sequel due to a cliffhanger ending. The Wade-Giles translations of the character names in the game are absurdly butchered.\n\nFINAL FIGHT aka FAINARU FAITO\n\nCapcom; Released 1989\n\nAlso known as Street Fighter '89, the game was Capcom's first actual beat-'em-up which turned out to be a phenomenon, featuring huge, detailed and colorful sprites back in the day and an awesome gameplay experience. Capcom solidified the character choices theme among speed type Guy, strength type Haggar and balanced type Cody. The game's simplicity and fluidity with 2-player cooperative action made it so popular and spawn SNES exclusive sequels. A few characters from the game even made it into the Street Fighter continuity.\n\nGOLDEN AXE\n\nSega; Released 1989\n\nReferencing the Conan the Barbarian films plus magical elements, Golden Axe introduces three warriors bent on revenge for the murders of their loved ones by the tyrant Death Adder and save the kingdom from him and his eponymous axe. Gilius the dwarf is the best on offense, Tyris the amazon excels in magic, and Ax the barbarian is the average joe. Sega's take on the sword and sorcery genre proved extremely popular that spawned two arcade spin-offs and two Megadrive-exclusive sequels. The three warriors and Death Adder are amongst the popular characters under Sega's flagship to this day.\n\nGOLDEN AXE: THE REVENGE OF DEATH ADDER\n\nSega; Released 1992\n\nAfter the events of the first game, the Revenge of Death Adder improves on the presentation and gameplay in many ways. The action continues with four new heroes: barbarian Sternblade, centaur Dora, elven farmer Trix, and the giant Goah, with Gilius from the first game mounted behind him. As the title implies, Death Adder makes a menacing return. Multiplayer player cooperation allows wrestling piledrivers for massive damage on enemies and bosses alike. Furthermore, players can choose paths between forks in the road, where the path not taken is challenged later on. The magic system was also revamped with each hero using up a fixed number of pots to cast unique elemental magic, while Trix can grow apple shrubs which can be harvested to restore health.\n\nGROWL aka RUNARK\n\nTaito; Released 1991\n\nInspired by the Indiana Jones saga, four forest rangers must prevent the syndicate of poachers from smuggling animals and wildlife. To do so, they must use every single weapon imaginable: from whips, grenades and rocket launchers to blow up these thugs! Four players can fight side-by-side in an all-out melee to bash heads of villains and their formidable leaders into ludicrous gibs. The game is very notable for the amount of gore as the heroes can mutilate bodies of enemies into smithereens with various firearms and weapons. It is also infamous for the very surprising twist regarding the final boss, which is quite new at that time. Could you destroy this menace for good in order to free the captive animals?\n\nTHE KING OF DRAGONS\n\nCapcom; Released 1991\n\nThe King of Dragons can be considered Capcom's early version of Dungeons & Dragons. Up to 3 players can choose up to 5 character classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses to trek through SIXTEEN brilliantly colorful stages of medieval fantasy. Players must work together to battle orcs, blobs, lizardmen, undead, harpies and enter the final showdown with the red dragon tyrant Gildiss! The Fighter has the most HP, the Cleric has the highest defense, the Wizard has excellent magic, the Elf has the best range and the Dwarf delivers the strongest blows. Choose your class wisely!\n\nKNIGHTS OF THE ROUND\n\nCapcom; Released 1991\n\nCapcom brought the Arthurian Legends to the arcades in the form of Knights of the Round. Up to 3 people can play as the agile Lancelot with his scimitar, balanced type Arthur with his Excalibur sword and powerful Percival with his axe. The game employed RPG elements through EXP gaining and leveling-up, where characters gain new weapons and armor for increased offensive and defensive capabilities. Just like in real-life fencing, the game has a critical blocking feature, which is a vital skill to survive deeper through the game.\n\nKUNG-FU MASTER aka SPARTAN X\n\nIrem; Released 1984\n\nA cornerstone of the beat-em-up genre, Kung-Fu Master tells the story of Thomas and his lover Sylvia who is kidnapped by the mysterious syndicate of Mr. X. Thomas is challenged to face the five martial arts masters who guard each of the five floors of the temple, with Mr. X being the final showdown. Thomas has a wide variety of martial arts skills at his disposal, and he has to use these strategically to survive each deadly section of the tower. The game is loosely based on the Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (retitled Spartan X in some regions), but most of its plot elements referenced Bruce Lee's ill-fated movie Game of Death.\n\nMETAMORPHIC FORCE\n\nKonami; Released 1991\n\nUsing the same engine as the X-Men arcade, four heroes must band together under the guidance of Athena, and they were endowed with the spirits of ancient guardians to stop an incoming evil: the resurrection of the Lord of the Underworld. These heroes: Ban, Claude, Ivan and Max, can morph into Beast Mode as a Minotaur, Werewolf, Werebear, and Werepanther respectively to gain increased attributes to attack more effectively. Enemies and bosses are also in the form of various anthromorphic beings. Like in X-Men, players can unleash a powerful move to clear the entire screen from enemies. It is also notable for having a significant difference between the US and Japanese versions.\n\nMUTATION NATION\n\nSNK; Released 1991\n\nWith the alien and mutant craze of the early 90s, SNK tells a story in the not so distant future where a scientist's biological experiments went awry and exploded. The genetic virus outbreak turned hapless commoners into rabid mutants. Players take the roles of homecoming citizens Ricky Jones and Johnny Hart to pacify the mutated and mechanical freaks the experiment had created. Instead of picking up weapons and items, the game produces four elemental spheres, which can be used to unleash force attacks via charging an energy gauge. Without any orbs, the players can still use a barrage of special techniques but at a toll of their own health.\n\nNINJA BASEBALL BAT MAN aka YAKYU KAKUTO LEAGUE MAN\n\nIrem; Released 1993\n\nAs its title name implies, up to four players portray ninja baseball players who have to recover of the Babe Ruth statue, along with relics in the Baseball Hall of Fame from the evil perpetrators. The entire game was a fountain of endless baseball references and puns from both American and Japanese sides. Much like the earlier Undercover Cops, the baseball heroes can attack, jump or use zapper moves to knock down an overwhelming crowd of enemies. Choose from Captain Jose, Twinbats Ryno, Beanball Roger and Stick Straw and bring back peace to baseball! It's one of the obscure yet very beloved title in the genre.\n\nTHE NINJA KIDS\n\nTaito; Released 1990\n\nFollowing the ninja craze of the time, Taito released their own ninja-related game, this time pitting them against an evil sect prophesied by Nostradamus to resurrect Satan in 1999. The whole game has marionettes as characters, be it the players, enemies and NPCs, justifying the mutilating blows that produce no blood at all. Four ninja kids: Hanzo, Akane, Sasuke and Genta must fight the satanists with their signature Oriental weapons to prevent the coming of Satan and the total annihilation of Japan, and the Earth itself!\n\nPRETTY SOLDIER SAILOR MOON aka BISHOUJO SENSHI SAILOR MOON\n\nGazelle/Banpresto; Released 1995\n\nBased from the popular manga and anime series of Naoko Takeuchi, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon follows the quest of 5 teenage girls who can transform into sailor-suited warriors of justice. The game itself is a loose adaptation of the series' Dark Kingdom arc. Up to two players can select from the five Inner Senshi. Sailor Moon is the most balanced, Sailor Mercury and Venus are the speedsters, while Sailor Mars and Jupiter are the bruisers. Gameplay utilizes the classic beat-em-up system mixed with magic crystals to unleash the Soldiers' signature moves from the manga. Use your powers against familiar foes like the Four Kings and the evil Queen Beryl!\n\nTHE PUNISHER\n\nCapcom; Released 1993\n\nBased on Marvel Comics' anti-hero vigilante, The Punisher allows players to assume the role of the Punisher aka Frank Castle whose family was massacred by mafia. Being a marine, the lone survivor Frank used his military skills, intelligence and tough build to seek revenge on the New York mafia crimelord Kingpin! A second player can join the action as SHIELD agent Nick Fury. Aside from using almost any visible object as weapons, the characters can draw out their pistols once faced by gun-wielding enemies for a flashy shoot-out! The graphics are extremely loyal to the comics blended with Street Fighter-like movesets. To highlight the best part... chuck a hand grenade and it goes boom, for the Punisher's wrath takes no prisoners!\n\nRENEGADE aka NEKKETSU KOHA KUNIO-KUN\n\nTaito/Technos; Released 1986\n\nA Taito-westernized version of Technos' earlier Kunio-Kun title, Renegade follows a vigilante who pummels members of various street gangs on his way to rescue his abducted girlfriend. The player has left and right attacks, and a jump. Combining joystick and button combinations can result in jumping kicks or running straight. Enemies will constantly come in an arena that takes a few screens, culminating in a final boss as the enemy count depletes to three. The game is a direct predecessor of the Double Dragon series and is considered to be one of the most influential titles in the beat-em-up genre.\n\nROBO ARMY\n\nSNK; Released 1991\n\nAnother Neo-Geo game set in a futuristic Detroit, Maxima and Rocky are two cops abducted by the mad scientist Dr. Jeed who turned them into cyborgs. Fortunately, Jeed was unable to place a neural chip on the two which would give him total dominion over them. Maxima and Rocky managed to escape, and it is up to them to smash through Jeed's robotic army to stop this madman who even took his own daughter hostage. The game is notable for being able to transform into an armored buggy and running over enemies for a limited time. Rocky later appeared in the King of Fighters 2000 as Maxima's alternate striker.\n\nSENGOKU aka SENGOKU DENSHOU\n\nSNK; Released 1991\n\nThe game's plot follows a 400-year old prophecy that two heroes will rise to prevent the return of an evil warlord who had torn the land apart with unspeakable evil. Such heroes consist of a street ninja and a cowboy traveling from an apocalyptic city to face enemies based from elements of Japanese mythology. The game held five stages where players will be sent back to Feudal Japan where undead samurais, monks and ninjas were revived using souls of innocents.
