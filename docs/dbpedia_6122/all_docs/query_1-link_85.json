        "text": "The NES has pretty decent beat em ups. Yes, it was outclassed by the arcade in its era. Arcades were just more powerful back then, but you didn't need to worry about quarters.\n\nThere's the Double Dragon games. The first was pretty fun, but didn't have cooperative play. This was fixed in the excellent sequel, DDII: The Revenge. DDIII is not to be mentioned lol. My only issues with the first two were the platforming challenges, especially DDII. This game already had really bad jump controls and adding precision platforming sections near end game was a buzzkill.\n\nBattletoads, a game I really enjoy, is more of a hybrid game to me. I wouldn't call it Beat Em Up. Although it was a nice bait and switch.\n\nIrem's Kung Fu, a black box game, on the NES, was rudimentary but still pretty fun.\n\nAnd then there's Konami's TMNT Beat Em Ups. The Arcade Game, a decent port given the hardware, and Manhattan Project, a solid original followup.\n\nMy favorite, though, is River City Ransom. The game still plays very well today. I loved the pseudo RPG elements, buying special moves, and buffing your stats. The OST is also iconic.\n\nI also loved the more \"Open World\" format at the time. It was very different and a nice change from the more common level format.\n\nThose are the ones I remembered the most.\n\nRiver City Ransom/Kunio for me. There's a lot about it that feels very... 2D Yakuza, before Yakuza was even a thing. The setting, the fact that its not levels but rather a large area you can explore, with shopping areas to build stats... Plus there's long fight like areas with bosses... Even though I played Kunio after Yakuza (so its hard to decouple the comparisons), I really appreciate what Kunio did on the NES all those years back... And Ive gone on to really enjoy the series.\n\nRunners up:\n\nMighty Final Fight - Rock solid brawler with cute sprites and fun action. Not as hectic as the arcade original but a solid downport.\n\nDouble Dragon 2 - Aside those damn platform bits, I really love how this one plays. Decent moves list, cool bosses/enemies and a nice expanded design over the original DD NES port which is fine, but somewhat by the numbers. A great evolution.\n\nTurtles 3: Manhatten Project - As much as I love the TMNT Arcade game (TMNT 2 on NES), I prefer the third game when it comes to actual combat mechanics and gameplay. Its expanded on nicely, great music, great sprites... a home run all round,\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game is the one I grew up with.\n\nI still remember the cheat code I learned in 2nd grade to get level select and 10 lives.\n\nOddly enough, in this Konami-developed game, the code is not The Konami Code.\n\nI have little experience with River City Ransom, however, I recall that you can beat on dudes with other dudes. Just pick up a dude and beat up his buddy, weilding his body as a weapon. That is awesome.\n\nI never played it!\n\nIt was a late NES game so I missed it. I may have it on one of the Virtual Consoles. It's on my list to play. Surprised it's not on NES Online for the Switch.\n\nThese late CAPCOM titles were notoriously difficult to get a hold of in Europe I've read. Well, outside of Germany anyway. Mega Man V, VI, Mighty Final Fight, Duck Tales 2, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2. Never saw any of them in stores in my country myself. All focus was on the Super NES at the time.\n\nRiver City Ransom/Kunio for me. There's a lot about it that feels very... 2D Yakuza, before Yakuza was even a thing. The setting, the fact that its not levels but rather a large area you can explore, with shopping areas to build stats... Plus there's long fight like areas with bosses...

Its expanded on nicely, great music, great sprites... a home run all round,\n\nThe great thing about RCR is that it was designed with the NES/Famicom in mind according to the creators. The first Kunio game came as Renegade in the US. I played it and even back then it wasn't good, but it did create the foundation for RCR.\n\nThe great thing about RCR is that it was designed with the NES/Famicom in mind according to the creators. The first Kunio game came as Renegade in the US. I played it and even back then it wasn't good, but it did create the foundation for RCR.\n\nRenegade was fun yeah. Limited but I think that was pre Double Dragon so it was basically creating a genre or there abouts so I can forgive that. Its got a decent number of moves for the time, and the console version, while downgraded graphically, is smoother.\n\nThat last stage though... a dude with a gun that KO's you in one hit lol. Im so happy for modern ports that have save states for that reason!\n\nI never played it!\n\nIt was a late NES game so I missed it. I may have it on one of the Virtual Consoles. It's on my list to play. Surprised it's not on NES Online for the Switch.\n\nI was still on the nes till like 96 lol. Then I got a SNES when that SNES + all stars + mario world (all on one cart) bundle came out in the twilight days of the SNES.\n\nI think my fave of the late nes games was duck tales 2 overall.\n\nDouble Dragon 2 or Mighty Final Fight probably. River City Ransom as well, but it's not quite as pick-up-and-play.\n\n/edit: Forgot about Turtles II and III, those were pretty decent.\n\nAs to why: DD2 just feels right to me. Love the music as well and it's short and sweet. I don't care for the platforming parts though.\n\nMighty Final Fight feels tight to play, probably the best playing one of the bunch. It's pretty repetitive though, as beat 'em ups tend to be.\n\nRCR also feels good to play and has some killer tunes and some funny randomness, but I don't play it as often because of the RPG elements, which are cool, but don't lend themselves well to repeat playthroughs.\n\nI don't like beat-em-ups but I grew up with TMNT3: Manhattan Project and have a huge soft spot for it. It also has probably the best music on the entire NES.\n\nBased on what I played of TMNT2: Arcade on NES, I feel like while it's also good, it tries too hard to adhere to the arcade game, making for some weird or awkward moments that don't quite fit the NES. On the other hand, TMNT3 was made from the ground up for the NES and therefore fits the system better.\n\nRiver City Ransom/Kunio for me. There's a lot about it that feels very... 2D Yakuza, before Yakuza was even a thing. The setting, the fact that its not levels but rather a large area you can explore, with shopping areas to build stats... Plus there's long fight like areas with bosses... Even though I played Kunio after Yakuza (so its hard to decouple the comparisons), I really appreciate what Kunio did on the NES all those years back... And Ive gone on to really enjoy the series.\n\nI loved that game so much. It got absolutely bonkers with two players, and the RPG aspect of buying power-ups added so much to it.\n\nOP got it right. RCR is at the top of the heap on the NES. Mighty Final Fight and TMNT3 are also great, but they too pale in comparison to the sharp, varied game feel and sheer depth of options found in Alex and Ryan's quest.\n\nI don't like beat-em-ups but I grew up with TMNT3: Manhattan Project and have a huge soft spot for it. It also has probably the best music on the entire NES.\n\nThat OST is god tier yeah\n\nRiver City Ransom/Kunio for me.

Its expanded on nicely, great music, great sprites... a home run all round,\n\nThis. This is the list.\n\nThe Adventures of Bayou Billy has a truly underrated soundtrack and a strong atmosphere that nails the Hollywoodified vision of its locale. It tapped into a strange melange of the zeitgeist(Crocodile Dundee) and exploitation throwbacks(70's films such as Burt Reynolds' Gator among others) and made roughly kid-friendly entertainment out of it. It defied genre with its varying play modes to the point that, mechanically speaking, it is one of the comprehensive NES games in the library.\n\nFuck that game. It's too hard.\n\nRiver City Ransom, babyyyyy!\n\nDouble Dragon 2 - great satisfying varied beat'em up. Lots of locations and enemies and memorable music.\n\nI'm putting Battletoads & Double Dragon on there too. I played 95% on the SNES, but the NES game is basically identical. It does have some non beat'em up levels, but I'd say it's more of a beat'em up than the first game. Satisfying combat with fun over the top moves and a fantastic soundtrack.\n\nRiver City Ransom - A ambitious semi ppen world with satisfying combat and a fun distinct look. I do have a \"problem\" with this game though. When you get your moves upgraded to the turbo variant it just doesn't really feel like a beat'em up anymore to me. You need that deliberate slower combo of attacks for it to feel satisfying. The turbo attacks just doesn't feel right.\n\nTurtles 2 I played a lot back in the day but it's not really great as a beat'em up since the enemies gain invincibility frames after attacked so they just break straight through your attacks.\n\nBatman Returns is worth a mention I think. I think maybe some people did not know that there was a NES version of this even. It's not the best, but it's not bad either for a beat'em up on the NES.\n\nMany of my favs already mentioned.\n\nMighty Final Fight is one of my top brawlers in any system, really enjoy it.\n\nDouble Dragon 1 and 2. Like 'em both! I grew up with 1 and it still holds up but of course, 2 is also a classic.\n\nTMNT 2/3 and Batman Returns. I haven't played a ton of these but always enjoy my experiences with them. As noted above, I didn't know much about Batman Returns until a few years ago.\n\nLastly but leastly, the old school mentions … Kung Fu, Renegade and Trojan. (I guess Trojan is a brawler?). I probably play these as much as the others due to their simple, pick-up-and-play nature.\n\nCouldn't quite get into RCR, combat is fun but I just don't like \"slowing down\" to go shopping/dining to level up. Prefer the built in leveling up in games like DD and Mighty Final Fight."
