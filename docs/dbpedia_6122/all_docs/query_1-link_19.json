        "text": "Arc System Works, the developers behind Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive, is working on a 3D revival of the classic 2D beat ‘em up game Double Dragon. According to Famitsu (translated by Video Games Chronicle), the new Double Dragon game will see Arc System Works reimagine the 1980s Nintendo Entertainment System-era game with 3D-modeled characters.\n\nDouble Dragon was a mainstay on arcades and consoles through the late '80s and and early 90s, appearing on a multitude of platforms and at one point teaming up with the Battletoads (it's true). It's revered as one of the most influential beat 'em ups of all time, with classics like Final Fight and Streets of Rage following in its footsteps.\n\nArc System Works acquired the rights to Double Dragon and other classic beat ‘em up series Kunio-Kun (River City) from Technos Japan Corp in 2015. Since then, it has released a myriad of games in the aforementioned series. Chief among them was Double Dragon 4— which was made in collaboration with the series’ original director Yoshihisa Kishimoto—and its anime-influenced spin-off, River City Girls.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhile the former was met received poor reviews, the latter garnered tons of critical acclaim. What’s more, River City Girls 2 featured Double Dragon leads Billy and Jimmy Lee as playable DLC characters in River City Girls 2. A roguelike spin-off, titled Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, was released in 2023 to average reviews.\n\nArc System Works' Double Dragon revival is expected to release sometime in 2025 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC.\n\nIsaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.
