        "text": "This experimental article explores the question of whether it is possible to examine the experience of playing fighting games (video games) as a form of self-cultivation or practice and, in so doing, whether it becomes possible to shift the debate about the potential impact of violent video games on the people who play them (and on society around them). The article draws on five years of surveys and interviews with gamers from around the world, but seeks to interpret this data through a critical and creative reading of the games themselves as well as a reading of the so-called bushidō tradition (of texts about the intersection between Zen and the martial arts). The article concludes that fighting games might be experienced as forms of martial arts in themselves, complete with potentials for self-transformation, but that this form of engagement requires appropriate intentionality from players, which provokes a space for a manifesto to guide players' intentions. From the Dragon to the Beast Bruce Lee is one of the most recognized names in contemporary history. It is no exaggeration to say that he changed the face of the martial arts, of the movie industry, and of Asian masculinity. 2 After the worldwide release of his landmark movie, Enter the Dragon (1973), and his untimely death in the same year, Lee's legend was secure. He became an icon; his brief presence on the world stage was a transformative moment in the lives of people all over the world, and remains a powerful inspiration to this day.\n\nPlaying the (International) Movie: Intermediality and the Appropriation of Symbolic Capital in Final Fight and the Beat ‘em up Genre Final Fight (Capcom 1989) is considered one of the most accomplished examples of “beat ‘em up,” a digital game genre that rose to international popularity in the second half of the 1980s. The streets depicted in this genre, appearing as a nearly mythological place where the heroes crush legions of foes in a sort of vigilante-like fantasy, are characterized as corrupted and degraded in compliance with representations of “street violence” in big American cities that were articulated in popular gang movies, such as The Warriors and Streets of Fire, and vigilante movies, such as Death Wish and Dirty Harry. Final Fight did not found the beat ‘em up genre by itself: it was in fact produced having on the background a specific, however recent, textual tradition and canon. This canon comprised texts produced within the same medium (i.e., other video games, mostly of Japanese production), but also drew from an intermedial corpus. In particular, for its design and narrative tropes, Final Fight inherited and incorporated a number of elements coming from the Hollywood action cinema that had been translated into the newer digital medium of video game. I argue that the evolution of this Japanese genre, marked by such milestones as Nekketsu kōha Kunio-kun (Technōs Japan 1986) and Double Dragon (Technōs Japan 1987), was intertwined with a process of negotiation with this international canon. The instantiations of the “street violence” discourse offered by Hollywood cinema provided the Japanese designers with a framework rich in aesthetic, narrative and even motivational elements to be appropriated in order to shape the massive and reiterated physical violence that was performed in their games. Combining historical and intertextual research with an analytical framework based on game studies and Pierre Bourdieu’s theory (1991, 1995), I argue that the classical beat ‘em up games that were produced in Japan carried out at a local level a function of symbolic appropriation and redistribution, because they remediated a cinematic textual canon (which was for a significant part of foreign origin) into the video game medium. Video game was, in other words, the means by which a portion of the Japanese cultural industry became able to appropriate the symbolic capital of Hollywood products, in such a successful way that such games became international hits, and a playground for trans-national symbolic exchange. https://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/article/view/vol9no1-4\n\nNavigating between society’s moral panics about the influence of violent videogames and philosophical texts about self-cultivation in the martial arts, The Virtual Ninja Manifesto asks whether the figure of the ‘virtual ninja’ can emerge as an aspirational figure in the twenty-first century. Engaging with the literature around embodied cognition, Zen philosophy and techno-Orientalism it argues that virtual martial arts can be reconstructed as vehicles for moral cultivation and self-transformation. It argues that the kind of training required to master videogames approximates the kind of training described in Zen literature on the martial arts. Arguing that shift from the actual dōjō to a digital dōjō represents only a change in the technological means of practice, it offers a new manifesto for gamers to signify their gaming practice. Moving beyond perennial debates about the role of violence in videogames and the manipulation of moral choices in gamic environments it explores the possibility that games promote and assess spiritual development.\n\nThe international success of contemporary martial arts films has stimulated critical debates and reflections on the aesthetics, politics, and economics of local/national Chinese cinemas, as well as the ideological implications of reinventing a ‘traditional’ genre for international audiences, against the backdrop of increasingly interpenetrable national and cultural borders brought on by the forces of globalization. This article attempts to delineate an ‘extra’ dimension of the martial arts film in the global context — the creation of a ‘digital imaginary’ that not only reinforces and supplements the more conventional modes of representation, but also enables a ‘universal’ frame of reference that contributes to the global currency of martial arts films. Drawing upon Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004), and Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer (2001) and Kung Fu Hustle (2004), it will illustrate how this digital imaginary displaces the exotic (Chinese) tradition into the familiar realm of digital media, resulting in a hybrid, multiply coded, culturally ambiguous, and therefore transnational visual medium for global consumption.\n\nThe following abstract is aimed to put into question how both the Japanese and Western gaming industries have differentiated themselves so much today, offering game systems and narratives that vary widely from each other. In the history of the medium, this differentiation was initially established because some semiotic and mechanic elements were identified to identifiable Japanese or American market tastes. Most of the time, the reasons that have been made to explain this difference within the medium have relied on either essential cultural differences or market determinism based on historical preferences. However, this paper argues that these differences aren't just formed due to specific cultural images or economic reasons, but mainly because of the formation of an identity discourse on the industry that has ghettoized specific formulas of player engagement to some cultural regions or supposedly minority groups. In the case of Japanese video games, we argue that several design conventions on the part of Japanese game designers have led to a paradigm that is unique to their cultural context. This paradigm can be distinguished from the one prevalent in the West because it has usually favored games that rely more heavily on the use of what we call “explicit narratives” to contextualize their rules, which have been solidified into several known “game genres” like the JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game), the “Visual Novel” and others. This paradigm was also highly influential in creating other genres that are ubiquitous in the medium today, specially during the era of the Japanese industrial dominance of the 80's and 90's. This model also encompass semiotic elements that are either textually related to other forms of Japanese media or have been used almost exclusively on Japanese video games. However, its presence has been reduced significantly today, to the point that it has become representative of games developed exclusively by the Japanese video game industry, even though it might be found outside that region. More so than that, it has been integrated within a bigger cultural discourse that identifies several forms of cultural artifacts as extensions of Japan into Western popular culture. Throughout this paper, we will explore the main elements that characterize this paradigm, including the concept of explicit narratives, and their manifestation on specific games. Finally, we will analyze its current influence on the development of the modern image of Japan, both in gamer consumer culture and the overall gaming industry today."
