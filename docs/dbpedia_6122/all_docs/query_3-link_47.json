        "text": "The rise of the scrolling beat ’em up genre continues with Double Dragon having another shot at a comeback after the less-than-stellar Double Dragon IV in 2017. The last time we got a good game in the series was 2012’s Double Dragon Neon. In 2023, Secret Base wants to give us a worthy successor to Neon and put the franchise back in the beat ’em up conversation. Have they succeeded?\n\nAs mentioned in my Preview, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is an “alternate take” on the origin story of the Double Dragon brothers Jimmy and Billy. Your mission is to rid a nuclear-devastated New York of the gangs that have now overrun it. But this time around it won’t just be the two of you. Uncle Matin and Marian (yes…that Marian) are also at the ready to dole out the punishment alongside you.\n\nLet’s go crazy!\n\nTherein lies the first of the two pretty major shifts to the franchise – the combat. Anyone who played the original Double Dragon games will remember the slow, clunky, and punishing combat that didn’t allow for more commonplace tactics like cheesing and any form of decent crowd control options.\n\nRise of the Dragons looks to mostly change all that. While cheesing still isn’t really much of an option, crowd control is now a massive focus for this game. Both through the additions of special moves (most of which are very reminiscent of Streets of Rage moves) and tag team combat a la Marvel vs Capcom. All of this is powered by a new special meter which is fed by your performance in combat. You can’t tag in your partner or perform special moves until the meter allows it.\n\nCrowd control tactics are also rewarded. Perform a move that takes out 3 or more enemies in one hit? You’re given a healing item as well as bonus money. The more enemies you can KO in a single go, the better the healing item and the amount of money dropped increases.\n\nBut how does the combat feel? Well…that’s an interesting question. As someone who has played most of the Double Dragon games of the past, it’s arguably the best-feeling iteration of the game. However, compared to it’s contemporaries it feels a little slow and clunky in most instances. Which I’m assuming was the developer trying to strike a balance between modernising the game, while not straying too far from the feel of the original games. To make matters worse, there are some fairly baffling control scheme decisions at play here which make the game more cumbersome to play than it needed to be. I understand why some developers want to do things their own way, but sometimes control scheme conventions stay consistent for a reason. Functions that would be muscle memory for most – double tap to run, your punch/attack button also being your item pick up, walking up to enemies to grab them, all these things are now assigned to their own button and to this point in time I can’t work out the benefit. Generally, when a game breaks with control scheme conventions, there’s a reason for it. Like introducing a new fun mechanic that requires some adjustment but is so enjoyable you eventually get used to it. Not here. No matter how long I played the game, I kept finding myself trying to double tap to run, or pressing attack to pick items up. All it meant, was that I rarely ever used combat options available to me like grab, because having all these options on dedicated buttons simply made the combat more convoluted than it needed to be. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\n\nIt actually makes the game fairly difficult compared to other scrolling beat ’em-ups. To the point where I needed to make use of the various accessibility options to make the game a bit easier to make it through. Even then it wasn’t exactly a walk in the park, even for someone with a little more experience with these types of games. When combined with some pretty difficult boss battles, some may find the whole thing a touch frustrating.\n\nSome of this is alleviated depending on the character you choose to play as and the game does a fantastic job of making all the characters feel very different to each other, more so than any other game I’ve played in the genre. As an example Jimmy and Billy feel genuinely different from each other, one is faster, the other is stronger, one can juggle enemies while the other has better crowd control special moves. This really encourages you to try and unlock more characters to get a feel for who you like for future runs.\n\nFuture runs you ask? Well…\n\nRogue-lite…lite\n\nThis leads us to the second shift in the franchise…the rogue-lite elements. While most will groan at the idea of rogue-lite elements in a scrolling beat ’em up, it actually fits pretty well here and if you think about the history of the genre and how these games are generally structured, I’m surprised it’s actually not more common. While Rise of the Dragons isn’t the first to do it, as far as I’m aware, it’s the first time a “big name” franchise has implemented such elements.\n\nIt’s all set up in a way that keeps each playthrough different depending on your choices. You choose the order of your missions and your choices affect the length and difficulty of the subsequent missions. This can help break the monotony of multiple playthroughs which tends to be an issue for the genre. As mentioned earlier, money is everywhere and it can be used to buy temporary end mission upgrades (which last for your run and many are stackable) or you can choose to save some of your money (or all of it) to revive dead players to further your run. But be aware, as you pay to revive a player, it becomes more expensive going forward. It’s a neat mechanic that adds a little more tension to the game, forcing you to be more careful and measured in how you play it.\n\nYou can also buy and unlock tokens which can be used to unlock characters (there are 13 in total), art, music, gameplay modifiers, and “tips” which are basically instructions or tips on how best to play the game.\n\nWhile the game isn’t very long – it can technically be “beaten” in about 2 hours, in true rogue-light fashion, there are multiple endings, some with their own story twist.\n\nHow Retro do you go?"
