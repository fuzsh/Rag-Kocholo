        "text": "@Bloodbane\n\nits scott pilgrim vs the world-ish looking,\n\nsince it was kind of important i can only suppose that devs use the style to kinda pander to that crowd/generation who \"links\" or relates and pretty much may have been firstlydely introduced to beat them ups via scott P vs the W\n\nnot a fan of the \"chibi\" style either,\n\ndouble dragon has always been an odd experience for me, the characters designs where weird and sort of ugly , but the animations and later on the snes the complexity and detail of some of the moves really compensated for it.\n\ni played the hell out of double dragon 2 on the nes and it was really enjoyable for some extrage reason i can't describe, only beat the snes once as a rental .\n\nyears later skip to double dragon neon and it was not the same at all.... i played for like an hour and never touched it since\n\nturtles in time re-shelled ws a better modernization me thinks....\n\nfrom what i see on the footage , this double dragon is missing that weird thing the old 80's 90's DD games had that made it stand out, even amongst other \"superior\" classics like final fight, SoR, guardians, etc...\n\nfrom what i see on the video it seems generic, which is a problem that tmtn shreder's revenge also had. it may be the art style, only actual game-play would allow me to judge it better\n\nI saw some people complaining about 3 things:\n\n1- The graphics are not as gritty as the original\n\n2- The game is too fast paced\n\n3- Hand guns in DD is weird\n\n1- I think the graphics are nice. They look like TMNT new game to me (and the graphics is one of the good things of that game)\n\n2 - I personally find the original arcade DD UNPLAYABLE to me nowadays. It's too slow for a beat em up (and the person who invented the reversed controls for the DD2 should be jailed, lol)\n\n3- Let me show you the Game Gear version, where they use not only handguns:\n\nThe original designer said \"Enemy's thoughts, attack range and response, grappling system, weapons, how to make use of terrain\", etc. feels very different from 'Double Dragon'.\"\n\nBut I think this is a good idea.\n\n緒方孝治氏、「ダブルドラゴン」新作は「どのような形であれタイトルが生かされる事は喜ばしい事」と語る 弊誌に向け「怒り」の真意をコメント\n\nフリーCGデザイナーの緒方孝治氏は、アークシステムワークスとMODUS GAMESより今夏発売予定のPC用アクション「ダブルドラゴン外伝 ライズ・オブ・ザ・ドラゴン」について、「どのような形であれ永続的にタイトルが生かされる事は喜ばしい事」と弊誌の取材に対しコメントした。\n\nYeah I don't hate graphics but I would have preferred a 16bit look, like final fight, sor 2 final vendetta etc\n\nIt's like a Mashup of 8bit/chibbi style and we've already got a lot of them:\n\nScott P\n\nThe toxic crusaders one\n\nShredders revenge\n\nRC Girls\n\nEtc\n\nBut the gameplay does look good and 13 playable characters, I'll get it but probably not day one.\n\nHey I found a demo for the Avengers chibi game:\n\nPlay Tiny Avengers right now!\n\nAn AWESOME Avengers mini game demo made for the love of Marvel Universe and in the hope to make a real game out of it."
