It's an interview with the man himself and it briefly overviews his career with the Double Dragon franchise.\n\nThere's some interesting stuff in the article like why there was so much inconsistency with the franchise, which ultimately led to its demise. He's a one-hit-wonder for sure, but I have to say this was one of the first arcade games I played as a kid and have some good memories playing it with my older brother. Good times.\n\nLast edited: Dec 5, 2012\n\nthebman80\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 22, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n7,394\n\nReaction score\n\n29\n\nLocation\n\nWallingford, Pennsylvania\n\nDec 5, 2012\n\n#2\n\nNice, Double Dragon Neon was a great game very well done. Got me back into the franchise anyone else play it? Was nice to play a updated 3D side scroller for a change instead of all this other rehashed madness with 3D. I think the industry just forgot about the side scrollers nice to see someone hasn't. Wish they would do a Legend of Zelda as a side scroller like Link but that's some wishful thinking. I lost all interest in the series after they wend 3D and never looked back. (It was just never the same)\n\nSchusler\n\nWell-known member\n\nDonor 2011\n\nJoined\n\nJan 26, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n4,513\n\nReaction score\n\n194\n\nLocation\n\nSycamore, Illinois\n\nDec 5, 2012\n\n#3\n\nWish he would elaborate more on the sequels. While I didn't think part II was awful barring reusing most of the levels from the first one. Part III OTOH is a complete kindergarten-made mess.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nnesjess\n\nWell-known member\n\nDonor 2011\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 4, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n9,496\n\nReaction score\n\n449\n\nLocation\n\nCastro Valley, California\n\nDec 5, 2012\n\n#4\n\nWish he would elaborate more on the sequels.

Ultimately, I got fed up with the way it was handling its finances.\"\n\nSo that's why they went belly up (well that and Double Dragon getting worse over the years)...\n\nBy the way, for beat em ups, there's no better list than this racketboy list. I highly recommend Shadow Force, which was Technos' last great game. It's a beat em up with 6 buttons, so it has more combat depth than a usual beat em up.\n\nhttp://www.racketboy.com/retro/the-best-undiscovered-beat-em-ups\n\nHewitson\n\nNew member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 26, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,874\n\nReaction score\n\n23\n\nLocation\n\nMelbourne, VIC, Australia\n\nDec 5, 2012\n\n#6\n\nDD2 on the NES is by far the best game in the series, I have no idea if he was behind that one but I suspect he wasn't.\n\nThe arcade games (not including DD3) were also very good, but not half as good as the absolute masterpiece on the NES. How funny was it making the bosses get sucked out of the helicopter! And when it backfired and you or your partner were sucked out instead it was even funnier.\n\nLast edited: Dec 5, 2012\n\nvib_ribbon\n\nNew member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 20, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n117\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nlondon, london, United Kingdom\n\nDec 6, 2012\n\n#7\n\ni thought the gameboy advance version was pretty playable, mixing elements from part 1 & 2.\n\nherbertsmart\n\nWell-known member\n\nDonor 2011, 2018\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 25, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n6,246\n\nReaction score\n\n166\n\nLocation\n\nInland Empire, California\n\nDec 6, 2012\n\n#8\n\nGood read, thanks for posting!

It's still fun but much harder not to let yourself get killed in the process."
