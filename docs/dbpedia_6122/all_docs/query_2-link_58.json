        "text": "The beat ’em up genre is one that, similarly to the retro FPS (“boomer shooter”), has made quite the resurgence in recent years.\n\nThere’s a certain timeless appeal to pummeling hordes of enemies through linear side-scrolling stages. Its simplicity is a core part of the genre’s identity and charm, which is why it has not seen much innovation since its heydays.\n\nModern beat ’em up titles prefer to stick to their roots, only sprinkling in some extra polish and quality of life improvements for a smoother and more approachable gaming experience. There’s nothing wrong with that really, as the saying goes: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.\n\nBut there is always room to experiment, that’s how you push the medium forward and potentially shape a generation of classics to come.\n\nThe Double Dragon franchise is an old cornerstone of beat ’em ups that has spawned numerous sequels and inspirations, alongside its more innovative sibling, River City Ransom.\n\nWhile the latter has gotten newfound success with the critically acclaimed River City Girls spin-offs, Double Dragon has had harder time adjusting to the current day. Double Dragon Neon attempted to breath new life into the series with its release in 2012, which while decently received by fans and critics, didn’t have a lot of staying power in the public consciousness.\n\nFast forward to our current year of 2023, and a small indie dev company by the name of “Secret Base”, which has previously worked on the beat ’em up title Streets of Red, has decided to give Billy and Jimmy another shot in the limelight. Only this time, with an interesting twist.\n\nUnlike the entries that preceded it, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is not the same old classic beat ’em formula rehashed.\n\nInstead, taking notes from the dev team’s last button basher, it mixes in elements from the rougelite subgenre to make up a title that manages to immediately stand out in the sea of quality releases.\n\nIt uses the Megaman approach of having you select which stage and subsequent boss you want to take on in whichever order you’d like. Only here, whatever order you choose will end up affecting your playthrough and alter the following stages significantly.\n\nEach stage is comprised of three sectors which conclude with an end-level boss, the very big bad naturally left to the final one.\n\nOnly you won’t get to experience them all on your first playthrough, as Double Dragon Gaiden employs its progression through dynamic rising difficulty. The very first stage you pick, no matter which it is, will always be the easiest one, having you go through only a single sector and the final boss at the end. From there the stakes get higher, as the remaining gangs buff up their ranks, so the second stage will then consist of two sectors and two bosses each. The third and fourth stages have the complete set of three sectors, with the fourth having you face a tougher, powered-up version of the regular stage boss at its conclusion.\n\nThis is all well and good on paper, a unique way of incentivizing multiple playthroughs while handing the player agency over the level of challenge they’d like to face. Some players may struggle with a particular stage or boss, so it’d be better for them to get that one out of the way first, while risking the odds for later.\n\nIt’s a difficulty curve that flows well enough, though its reliance on artificially bumping up damage numbers and health for enemies and bosses ends up naturally hampering the experience as it goes along, and in the final chosen stage in particular, where bosses are granted super-armor alongside their already crazy high damage output and deep health pools. This leads to more frustration at the game’s mechanics, rather than feelings of satisfaction from overcoming a worthy challenge. A flaw that is further exacerbated by the title’s lack of reliable defensive options.\n\nThe core combat of Double Dragon Gaiden is solid.\n\nIt’s a familiar control setup to anyone who’s ever touched a beat ’em up before, with your standard combo string and special moves that shift depending on which direction you pair the button press with.\n\nEach special consumes your SP bar for use, which is filled up automatically, though you’re able to speed things up by keeping up your offence. In any classic beat ’em up, your neutral special is vital in shaking enemies off of you when surrounded, as you can often get.\n\nAs such, the attack is granted invincibility frames during its animation that allow you pull it off without the enemy’s attack intercepting. Double Dragon Gaiden doesn’t grant you invincibility frames, for any of the special attacks.\n\nThe issue with that should be obvious, if you’re ganged up on and get caught in a string of attacks, there’s no way for you to regain your momentum and prevent significant damage to your character.\n\nThe older Double Dragon titles had a block and parry feature for such situations, but Gaiden decided to not implement any.\n\nAdding onto this, grabbing and throwing enemies, which usually serves as an essential tool of crowd control in the genre, is relegated to only a select few characters here, which even then isn’t nearly as applicable.\n\nThe others get a different “special action” which varies completely between characters. A neat addition to further flesh out a character’s individual moveset and helps in making them each stand out, but sacrificing a universal grab mechanic for it seems more of a determent.\n\nOddly enough, your jump actually has I-frames. Which would be useful, if most of the fighting wasn’t done on ground level, making the idea of jumping in the middle of combat to avoid an attack that’s not even coming from the air.. frankly preposterous. It’s not a replacement for a proper defensive special.\n\nAnd neither is the game’s fancy tag system for that matter.\n\nThe other major gimmick Double Dragon Gaiden incorporates in its gameplay structure, is the ability to control not one, but two characters.\n\nNot simultaneously of course, that would be a headache and a half, but you could switch to a second brawler of your choice in the midst of battle.\n\nWhen your special meter is full, instead of spending it to bust out a powerful technique, you could instead tag your partner in.\n\nThe tag-in is uninterruptable, which means that yes, this is your only viable means of defense. Once I understood that and started focusing on tag team related upgrades such as knocking enemies back when a tag is made, I could get into the hang of things once again.\n\nUntil one of my characters died and I was back to square one.\n\nSee, while both of the playable characters share an SP bar, they each have their own individual health bar. While this makes tagging a character out to save it from further spanking a viable tactic, it also means that if either of them were to perish, you’d be, honestly, fucked.\n\nAnd let’s talk about those upgrades I mentioned, as they come as part of the rougelite package deal. After finishing a sector you are greeted with a menu that presents four randomly generated upgrades you could purchase for your character with the money you’ve acquired (or stolen) kicking ass.\n\nThese upgrades are pretty standard, HP buffs, attack buffs, speed buffs, added armor, combo buffs, special buffs, coco puffs and all.\n\nThe more crucial stuff relate to enhancing the tag system, which as I’ve reiterated is your main means of defense. But in order to make it nearly as useful as it should be, you’d have to spend your cash on any tag team related upgrade you lay your eyes on.\n\nIf this were simply buffing an aspect of your character as with any of the other options on display, this would not be a problem. But this is stuff that is frankly crucial to getting by the later stages without dying (much).\n\nAnd if the tag system’s viability as a tool to interrupt enemy attacks was simply an additional layer to the combat alongside a proper defensive option, this wouldn’t be a problem at all.\n\nBut it simply isn’t, and as such, it very much is.\n\nI don’t want this to come off as a negative review of the game.\n\nI have issues with it, and I’m sure as hell going in depth discussing them, but that doesn’t change the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed myself.\n\nI played through the whole thing five times now, not just to experience the entirety of the content, but also to have more fun with it.\n\nI love the beat ’em up genre for how easy it is to get into and just play.\n\nEven then, having a title like Double Dragon Gaiden attempt to push the envelope and experiment a bit, is admirable on principal in my eyes.\n\nAnd despite what I may have lead you to believe, they actually did get a lot of it right.\n\nThe combat is heavily centered around your special attacks, any enemy you finish off with one earns you extra buck, while managing to finish off 3 or more with a single special gifts you a healing item.\n\nThis is a great system that encourages optimal use of your moves and crowd control, with a long-term reward of more money for upgrades and potential unlocks, while also serving an instant reward for your efforts during battle.\n\nThe unlockables are also an incentive for you to play well in order to get more money which will allow you to unlock additional characters, art, music and tips. This makes the choice of saving your cash instead of purchasing an upgrade after finishing a sector a nice “risk vs reward” dilemma.\n\nThe level design is worthy of praise as well, as instead of simple linear corridors that go exclusively from left to right, Double Dragon Gaiden spices things up with added verticality and platforming to the mix, various rooms you go in and out of, and even traps and hazards spread along your path. Dying, as in any rougelite is punished, but given a tad more leeway here. You can revive in place as you long as you have enough money to spend on it, the cost of which rises with each use.\n\nWould you rather accept defeat, losing out on more loot, but saving the stack you’ve already accumulated for the unlockables?\n\nOr spend some of the money here for a revive to hopefully finish the stage and cash out on a bigger prize?\n\nThe entire dynamic of money defining your progress within the game is really well done.\n\nAll of this is to say that there truly is an incredibly solid base here, one that if it gets its kinks ironed out, could turn into something truly special.\n\nI like to criticize media that I enjoy for there to be a clear place of improvement to turn something good into something great and even greater. Whether it’s by the original creators, or someone who was inspired by their works. And for myself, for my possible future in pursuit of my own creativity and art."
