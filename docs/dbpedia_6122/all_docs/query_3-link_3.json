        "text": "I was wondering, I wanted to check out more games that fit this type, or genre if that makes sense-- 2D Beat Em Ups that are primarily Fighting games or Fighting Games that have a 2D Side Scrolling/Platforming Adventure type mode to them. I listed an example of a few DIMPS games, below, that came out on the GBA and NDS. Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure and the Draglade series. These titles both offer a platforming, beat em up, style game while also being 1 on 1 fighting games. Off the top of my head the only games I can think of, in recent memory, that offer this style of play is Streets of Rage 4 & Fight'N Rage .\n\nAlso, I feel that some Arc System Works games had some beat em' up style modes in the fighters they make, but I can't recall which games outside of Granblue Fantasy VS at the moment. Maybe I'm just feeling a little nostalgic, but I found my old DS and fired up some Jump Ultimate Stars and recalled that I spent a good amount of time playing the titles below. I don't think this is a common mix of genre's anymore, or I guess I don't know of many-- I was hoping for some input from Resetera as I'd like to find other games of this style.\n\nDraglade is hella underrated.\n\nI could say the same for Advanced Adventure. Even within Dragon Ball fandom, nobody really talks about it but its honestly one of the best DB games and just a pretty damn solid beat em up in it's own right.\n\nI agree, Dragon Ball Advanced Adventure-- A platforming/beat'em up, had a combo heavy Fighting Game (complete with Air Combos) all rolled into one. I think it was my favorite Dragon Ball Franchise game till FighterZ came out, before that it was Hyper Dragon Ball Z-- a Fan game.\n\nI believe, for the most part, Draglade played very similarly to Dragon Ball Advanced adventure which is why I loved that series so much. I never played the second one as it wasn't localized. Seems that DIMPS has gone all in on Xenoverse, I don't know if they've produced much else over the years. Now that I think of it, didn't the Beat Em' Up genre spawn from fighters? Like Final Fight came from Street Fighter, or was it the other way around? Thanks for all the suggestions thus far, I'm looking into posted guilty gear games as I type this."
