        "text": "The singer/producer on Robert Redford, dressing like a dandy for the women, the importance of socks and why men should not be scared of jewellery\n\nI adore cars and love driving.\n\nI drive an Enzo Ferrari, but also have a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren that I ride around in. The other vehicle that I love is my tour bus, because it has a studio installed in the back and I can record wherever I am in the world.\n\nMy style icon is Robert Redford.\n\nHe gets it right all the time, and he never looks as if he’s trying too hard to look good. He is always totally dapper.\n\nThe ladies in my life prefer me to dress like a dandy.\n\nI am severely hooked on Ralph Lauren Purple and Black labels – genius stuff. The attention to detail is so great.\n\nSocks matter for me and they should matter for everyone.\n\nEverything you wear should reflect your state of mind plus the vibe, politics and economy of the time.\n\nI just bought a pair of Le Chameau wellington boots.\n\nI’m looking forward to wearing them at this summer’s festivals.\n\nI am really influenced by the clothes in the film ‘Chariots Of Fire’.\n\nI’m partial to classic English clothes because they have both function and purpose. My own label, Billionaire Boys Club, is collaborating with Cordings of Piccadilly to design a line in herringbone tweed.\n\nDon’t be scared of vintage clothes.\n\nI will buy vintage or I will buy new. I don’t care where it comes from – if you like something, buy it. I do both classic and new; I don’t limit myself in any way whatsoever with my clothing. If I like something I just go for it.\n\nMen should not be scared of jewellery.\n\nYou should wear whatever jewellery you feel is appropriate. I get a lot of my stuff made for me in New York by Jacob The Jeweler and Lorraine Schwartz. I bring in sketches or something for them to copy. I’ve had a carabina made in diamond and gold to hold my car keys.\n\nMy Mickey Mouse slippers are very important.\n\nYou can buy them from Disney World and they are big, yellow, fluffy, ankle- high slippers. They are super comfortable.\n\nJohn Lobb is dope.\n\nI visited their store recently and they took me through the company’s history. They showed me through their massive archive and all the lists of all the famous individuals’ feet that they’ve made shoes for like Sinatra, Laurence Olivier and the Prince of Wales. I need to further my education in what to get from them, as that is a real dandy’s shoemaker.\n\nYou can definitely have enough tattoos.\n\nI have seven, but that’s enough for now.\n\nI have to be careful what I wear so I don’t become too ‘me-ised.’\n\nWhat I mean is, I’ve designed lots of different clothing ranges but I have to be careful not to wear them all at the same time.\n\nIf I had a fire in my house and could only save one item of clothing I’d never come outside.\n\nI’d burn. I don’t have a favourite item as I appreciate each piece I own as a part of my wider collection.\n\nIn the past I’ve worn some truly awful outfits.\n\nAnd no, I won’t tell you what they are because I prefer not to revisit those moments and I don’t want people to turn up photographs going, ‘Look at you there!’\n\nMy advice to anyone who wants to look good is to make sure you feel comfortable.\n\nI wear what I want and always try to be myself. I just hope that I’ll be stylish and fashionable.\n\nI have several iPods and each one is filled up by artists I respect...\n\nQ Tip, DJ Premier and Gilles Peterson – they are people whose taste I respect and each of them teaches me something about music.\n\nInterview by Chris Sullivan\n\nPharrell Williams is co-owner of the Billionaire Boys Club label. His new single ‘Sooner Or Later’ is out tomorrow\n\nRay-Ban Wayfarers (top left)\n\nAn example of great, classic design. They will never go away. ray-ban.com\n\nRalph Lauren Purple and Black Labels (top right)\n\nThe attention to detail is amazing.\n\nGlytone moisturiser (top left)\n\nIf men look after their skin it look after them. glytone.com\n\nVans trainers (top right)\n\nI wear them until they fall apart. My ideal would be a cross between classic Vans and Nike.\n\nMercedes-Benz SLR McLaren (top)\n\nI love this car - it's £355k of pure style."
