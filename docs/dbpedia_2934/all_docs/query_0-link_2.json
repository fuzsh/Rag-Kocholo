        "text": "From the Collection:\n\nThe collection contains materials donated by and relating to individuals working to support AIDS causes and equal rights in the LGBT community. Organizational leaders such as John Thomas, Don Baker, Bill Nelson, Terry Tebedo, William Waybourn, and Mike Richards contributed papers, court cases, and personal artifacts. These materials provide a personal perspective of the individuals impacted by AIDS in the 1980s and 1990sand the effect those experiences had on friends, family, and the community. The collection also contains organizational contributions from notable LGBT activists such as Dianne Hardy-Garcia, Louise Young, Vivienne Armstrong and Jamie Schield. Also included are documents relating to Dallas Gay Alliance vs. Dallas County (1989), a case in which Ron Woodroof, Alliance leadership, and attorneys representing the Dallas Gay Alliance filed suit for discriminatory practices against AIDS patients at Parkland Memorial Hospital. This collection contains a variety of documents and multimedia objects: personal papers, awards, artifacts, periodicals, newspapers, office files, newsletters, medical information, videotapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, DVDs, photographs, slides, and court documents. Included in the collection are publications such as The Advocate, Christopher Street, Out, T.W.I.T. (This Week In Texas), Dallas Voice, Curve, Genre, POZ, Lesbian Connection, and others featuring articles on sexuality, entertainment, local events, politics, biographies, health, and other matters concerning the LGBT community. Due to the nature of the Resource Center and its primary goal, HIV and AIDS-related publications also embody a significant share of the collection. The collection also includes various materials and artifacts representing several LGBT events, including t-shirts, buttons, banners and other items from the Tanqueryâ€™s Texas AIDS Ride, Lone Star Ride, Black Tie Dinner, Gay Games, Razzle Dazzle Dallas, March on Washington, and National Coming Out Day. These materials reflect the contributions of organizations operating on local and national levels such as Team Dallas, Stonewall, Turtle Creek Chorale, Texas Gay Rodeo Association, Cathedral of Hope, and the Dallas Gay Pride Association."
