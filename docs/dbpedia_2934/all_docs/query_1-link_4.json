As it was dragged slowly along the country roads it shook and creaked and wheezed, protesting, as it were, that it had performed its duty in life and that its long labors justly entitled it to permanent repose. The horse, with its burden behind it, had long ago given over complaining, and, although its plight was no less woful, was demonstrative only through physical compulsion. With drooping head, lustreless eyes, and laboring breath, it plodded on, with many a longing look at tempting morsels out of its reach.\n\nAt the present moment it was at rest, released from the shafts, and partaking of a spare meal, humanly provided, eking it out with sweet tid-bits, not too abundant, munched from the fragrant earth. Sitting on the ground at the back of the caravan was a man with a book in his hand, which sometimes he read with the air of one who was in the company of an old and beloved friend; at other times he gazed around with pensive delight upon the beauties of nature, which in no part of the world find more exquisite representation than in the county of Surrey. In the rear of the caravan were lovely stretches of woodland, through vistas of which visions of cathedral aisles could be seen by the poetical eye. Across the narrow road was a scene which brought to the man's mind some lines in the book he held. Turning over its pages, he called out, in a voice not strong, but clear:\n\n\"William Browne might have camped on this very spot, Nansie, and drawn its picture. The resemblance is wonderful.\" Then he read from the book:\n\nA practical flight of wooden steps at the back of the caravan afforded means of getting in and out, and when the man began to speak aloud a young woman issued from the interior of the conveyance, and stood upon the top of the little ladder, listening to his words.\n\n\"It is very beautiful, father,\" she said. \"To think that it was written nearly three hundred years ago!\"\n\n\"Yes, Nansie, in the days of Shakespeare; and it might be to-day. That is the marvel of it.\"\n\nHe fell to his book again, and Nansie, who held a teapot in her hand, beat a retreat and resumed her domestic duties.\n\nA peculiar feature of the caravan was that it was commercially empty. In times gone by it had been used for trading and speculative purposes, by gypsies, by enterprising travellers, by venders of basketware, by dealers in birds. It had served as mart and dwelling-house, and had played its part in numberless fairs when they were in fashion. Now it contained nothing marketable, and bore about it no sign to denote that its denizens were travelling for profit; but that, even in its old age, it was being put to pleasant use was proved by the smoke curling from the little chimney projecting through the roof.\n\nIn due time Nansie reappeared, bearing two loose boards which she laid upon a pair of low trestles, spreading over them a white cloth. Upon this improvised table she set a smoking teapot, milk and sugar, and a plate of bread-and-butter, cut reasonably thick.\n\n\"Tea is ready, father.\"\n\nShe ate with an appetite. Her father ate more daintily. Before putting the food into his mouth he cut it into devices of fish and bird, which he then proceeded to slice and carve, evidently adding thereby to his enjoyment of the humble fare. And yet through all, whether he ate or read or mused, there was about him a conspicuous air of melancholy.\n\nIt was the evening hour, and the season was spring. It was a warmer spring than usual; there was a taste of summer in the air. They ate in silence, until the man remarked:\n\n\"You did not hear the nightingale last night?\"\n\n\"No, father.\"\n\n\"It sang for hours, Nansie.\"\n\nShe nodded, and said: \"I wish you could sleep as soundly as I do, father.\"\n\n\"I used to in my young days, and must be content. I am glad you sleep well. You have other wishes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Nansie, calmly.\n\n\"You have a fine trick of composure, Nansie. What stirs within does not always find outward expression.\"\n\n\"I take after you, father,\" said Nansie, in an affectionate tone. \"I have you to thank for all that is good in me.\"\n\n\"It is a pleasant hearing, but it cuts both ways. Do not your other wishes trouble you?\"\n\n\"A little; but everything will come right.\"\n\n\"A comfortable philosophy, my dear child; but womanly.\"\n\n\"It was mother's,\" said Nansie. \"I caught it from her.\"\n\n\"I know; and I could never make the dear mother understand that it was inadequate for the practical purposes of life. Eventually we may be satisfied that everything will come right, but before the end is reached there are many turnings. The mischief of it is\"--and there was now in his face as he turned it more fully towards her an expression both whimsical and sad--\"that we carpet the turning we wish to take with flowers of fancy which, as we proceed, fade utterly away. That is a human experience.\"\n\n\"I am human,\" said Nansie, and she pressed her young face to his.\n\n\"I could laugh and I could weep,\" he said, responding fondly to her caress. \"In truth, my dear child, you perplex me.\"\n\n\"Or,\" suggested Nansie, \"is it you who are perplexing yourself?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders affectionately, and did not reply.\n\nThe young woman was fair and beautiful. Though cast in a delicate mould, she was strong and redolent of health. Her face was slightly browned, and harmonized with her brown hair and brown eyes, the light in which was bright and tender. The man looked old, but was barely forty-five, and on his face were signs of suffering, patiently borne. They were dressed like persons in humble life, but with a certain refinement, observable more in the woman than in the man. For five evenings they had tarried on this spot. Each morning they had harnessed the horse to the caravan, and had journeyed slowly and aimlessly onward till noon, and then had turned back towards their camping-ground, which lay in the shadow of the beautiful Surrey woods, at a sufficient distance from the narrow road to escape casual observation. The right of doing so probably did not belong to the wayfarers, and this had disturbed the man somewhat, but he had fixed upon the spot for a particular purpose, and up to this evening had not been interfered with.\n\n\"At what hour last night,\" said Nansie, presently, \"did you hear the nightingale?\"\n\n\"It must have been near midnight,\" replied her father. \"At the same time to-night it will sing again. Have you finished your tea?\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Then go again to the post-office, and see if there is a letter for me. I am growing anxious at not receiving one. You need not stop to clear these things; I will put them away.\"\n\nShe rose and stood for a moment with her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. He drew her face down to his, and kissed her. With a bright nod she left him, carrying with her a written order authorizing the delivery of any letters which might be lying in the post-office for her father.\n\nGodalming, the town for which she was bound, was within a mile, and she stepped out briskly. But when she was about midway, and no one was in sight, she made a little detour into the woods, and drew from her bosom a picture. It was the portrait of a young man, and she gazed fondly at it, and kissed it as fondly. Then she drew forth a letter, and read it and pressed it to her lips; after which she replaced the letter and the portrait, and proceeded on her errand. Her thoughts may be thus fashioned into words:\n\n\"I wrote to him yesterday, and I sent him a telegram in the evening, knowing we should be here to-day. He may be absent. I hope not; I hope he has received both. Will he write, or will he come? Will he be angry that I have accompanied my father? At all events he knows, and he is never unjust. Ah! if he were here with us, how happy I should be! I love him, I love him, I love him!\"\n\nShe blew a kiss into the air.\n\nIn less than half an hour she was in the Godalming post-office, making her inquiry.\n\n\"Mr. James Loveday,\" said the female clerk, looking at the order handed to her by Nansie--she was familiar with it, having seen it on each of the three previous days. \"Yes, there is, I think.\"\n\nShe sorted some letters and handed one to Nansie, who, after hesitating a little, asked:\n\n\"Is there a letter for Miss Loveday?\n\n\"Are you Miss Loveday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No, there are none.\"\n\n\"Or for Miss Nansie Loveday? N-a-n-s-i-e.\"\n\n\"That's a curious way to spell Nancy,\" said the clerk. \"No, there are none.\"\n\nNansie lingered.\n\n\"Or for Manners?\" she asked, with singular timidity and bashfulness.\n\n\"Mrs. or Miss?\" inquired the clerk.\n\nNansie's face and neck were scarlet as she replied: \"Mrs.\"\n\n\"None for that name,\" said the clerk.\n\nShe lingered still, and said, with a kind of pathetic imploring: \"Would a telegram be received here if addressed to the post-office till called for?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I sent one yesterday, and expected an answer. Is there any for either name?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Nansie, and walked out of the office, and set her face towards the caravan.\n\nThe female clerk looked after her sympathizingly. There was a love note in her voice, and the post-office girl had a little sweethearting of her own on hand.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nNansie walked on, turning the letter in her hand, and glancing at it occasionally. The writing was strange to her, and on the envelope was the London post-mark. When, at the end of twenty minutes, she stood by her father's side, he was asleep.\n\n\"Father!\" she said, bending over him.\n\nHe opened his eyes instantly, and smiled at her.\n\n\"Ah, Nansie, it is you. I drop off constantly now, on the smallest provocation from silence or solitude. But it can scarcely be called sleep; I am conscious of all that is going on around me.\" He observed the letter in her hand, and he said, eagerly, \"You have one!\" and took it from her. \"Yes, it is from my brother Joseph; I was beginning to fear that he was dead.\"\n\nHe opened the letter and read it, and then remained a little while in thought. Presently he resumed the conversation.\n\n\"You saw your uncle once, Nansie. Have you a recollection of him?\"\n\n\"Hardly any, father. How old could I have been when mother took me to see him? Not more than four or five, I think. I had a white dress and a blue sash, and I took him a bunch of flowers. He gave me some sweetmeats, I remember, and a shilling. But I have no recollection of his face. He lived in London, in a street off Whitechapel; that I know.\"\n\n\"He lives there now. Your mother never spoke to you of him?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"You should be made acquainted with the story, Nansie, while I am here to relate it.\"\n\nShe stopped the current of his speech.\n\n\"Father, these last three or four weeks you have dropped hints which make me very anxious; they weigh heavily upon me. I know you are not well, but you harp upon it as if it were a serious illness. Tell me, father.\"\n\nThey were sitting side by side now, and he was smoothing her hair with his hand.\n\n\"I am far from well, Nansie.\"\n\nShe interrupted him again, and now spoke with tremulous impetuosity.\n\n\"You should take advice, father. You should go to a doctor.\"\n\n\"There are reasons why I do not do so. First, Nansie, I have no money. Figuratively speaking, twopence ha'penny is all my fortune. To be exact, twenty-three shillings represents my worldly wealth. I am afraid I have been unwise, and yet I do not see what else I could have done. This Quixotic wandering of ours--I own it, it is Quixotic--was in a certain measure forced upon me. Poor old Fleming, who owed me money, bequeathed his horse and caravan to me, his only creditor, and then he died. Had he left behind him wife or child I should have transferred to them this delightfully awkward property. Satisfying myself that it was legally and morally mine, the idea entered my head that a wandering tour through our lovely country lanes would invigorate me, would put new life into me. And for a companion, who more sweet than my own dear Nansie!\"\n\n\"There was another reason, father,\" said Nansie, gravely.\n\n\"There was another reason,\" said Mr. Loveday, apprehensively. \"I am coming to it. It would have been useless to consult physicians. I have consulted them again and again, and the result was always the same. A fever? Yes, there would be a fair chance of curing it. A toothache, a cold in the head, a chill? Yes, they could prescribe for those ills--but not for mine. It is my old heart-complaint, of which I have been repeatedly warned. When I was a lad it was thought I should not grow to manhood, but I did, as you see, and married your mother, and have by my side a dear child to cheer and comfort me. It is well to be prepared-- Why, Nansie, crying?\"\n\n\"I cannot help it, father, you speak so solemnly.\" She conquered her agitation and said: \"That is not the reason I mean. There is another.\"\n\n\"Concerning myself, Nansie?\"\n\n\"Concerning me, father.\"\n\n\"You wish me to speak of it?\"\n\n\"It will be best.\"\n\n\"So be it. I have not been always with you, Nansie, to guide and counsel you. Worldly circumstances would not permit me. I have cause to reproach myself. Had I been a carpenter or a bootmaker I might have been better able to fulfil my duties.\"\n\n\"No one can reproach you, father; and I, who love you with my heart and soul, less than any in the world.\"\n\n\"I thank you, child, and am grateful. At all events, something was done; I fitted you for the sphere of a private governess, and you obtained a situation. From time to time I came to see you, and you seemed to be happy.\"\n\n\"I was happy, father.\"\n\n\"You filled the situation two years, and then the sudden removal to another country of the family in which you were employed deprived you of it, and threw you upon the world. You did not inform me of this at the time, Nansie.\"\n\n\"You had troubles and struggles of your own, father, and I did not wish to harass you.\"\n\n\"Your endeavors to obtain another situation were unsuccessful; the gentleman who engaged you as governess to his children went away in your debt; you were almost at the end of your resources. Of all this I was ignorant until a few weeks since when I came to see you. Then and then only did I learn what had occurred; then and then only did I realize the dangerous position in which you were placed; then and then only did I discover that your affections were engaged to a gentleman whose father is a man of great wealth. My duty was clear; I had come into possession of this legacy, and it seemed to afford a favorable opportunity for the distraction of an unhealthy fancy-- You place your hand on my arm; you wish to speak.\"\n\n\"No, father, no,\" said Nansie, struggling with her feelings; in the gathering dusk her father could not see the play of emotion in her features; and, indeed, during this latter recital she kept her face averted from him; \"I am not yet at liberty to do so. Go on.\"\n\n\"For the distraction of an unhealthy fancy,\" he resumed, \"which might grow into a disease--which might wreck the happiness of a life most dear to me, I called upon you by the tie which binds and unites us--I am not wrong, dear child, in saying it unites us?\"\n\n\"No, my dear father, it unites us now and ever.\"\n\n\"My child!' I called upon you to accompany me in my wanderings, and you consented. I think I have stated it fairly Nansie?\"\n\n\"Quite fairly, father.\"\n\n\"Have you anything new to say about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except\"--and a delicious smile played upon her lips--\"except that I love Kingsley.\"\n\n\"That is not new,\" he said, in a tone of whimsical reproach; \"it is old. You have told me that before.\"\n\n\"It is always new to me, father. And there is something else I must say.\"\n\n\"Say it, Nansie.\"\n\n\"Kingsley loves me.\"\n\n\"Neither is that new. Apart from this I sometimes have an odd idea that you have a secret which you are keeping from me.\"\n\n\"If I said I had, it would be half revealing it. Father, time will show.\"\n\n\"That is a wiser philosophy than that 'Everything will come right.' Time does and will show. Shall I now relate the story of your uncle?\"\n\n\"If you please, father.\"\n\n\"It will not take me long. Your mother, my dear Nansie, had two ardent lovers, your father and your uncle.\"\n\n\"That was sad.\"\n\n\"These are strokes of fate not to be avoided, and love, which unites, sometimes severs. It severed me and my brother, and neither he nor I, nor your mother, Nansie, was to blame for it. In youth we had a great affection for each other, although our characters were dissimilar. Our father was a poor gentleman--our family boat never floated into a golden stream--and he gave us as good an education as we could have gained in schools And colleges. He had a taste for books, and he cultivated the taste in us, his only children. He had ideas, too, and to be in his company was an entertainment. When he died he left each of us a little money, not more than a hundred pounds apiece, with which we were to seek our fortunes. We remained together, and in this association we became acquainted with your mother. By that time I had grown into a dreamer, and, I am afraid, a vagrant; your uncle was a dreamer also, but his visions were not entirely Utopian, and he was less of a Bohemian than I. He loved your mother passionately, and by force of fate we were rivals. We both tried our fortunes with her; it was not a case of one supplanting the other, but fair play on both sides; he failed and I succeeded. Your mother was a sweet and beautiful lady, and how I won her I know not.\"\n\n\"Father,\" whispered Nansie, \"you have a silver tongue and the heart of a man. That is how you won my mother.\"\n\n\"Well, well, child, I should be past these flatteries, but as you said of yourself a while ago, I am human. My brother, learning that he had lost what he would have given the world to gain, cut himself adrift from us. He would not listen to reason, and I do not wonder at it. When was love really reasonable? What he did he did with determination, and all my implorings could not move him. He vowed that he and I should evermore be strangers, and so departed, and from that day we have not met. After my marriage I wrote to him from time to time, but he never replied to one of my letters. It was only when you and your mother returned from the visit you paid him that I learned he kept a bookshop in the East of London. I see his handwriting now for the first time in twenty years. Your mother and I constantly spoke about him; he possessed many admirable qualities; but, were I pushed to it, I should find it very difficult to say into what kind of a man he would grow, except that he would be constant and steadfast in his opinions. It was in the hope that he would soften towards me that, when you were a child, I sent you with your mother to see him. I see you now as you recalled yourself, in your little, white dress and blue sash, with the bunch of flowers you were to present to him. These are a part of a woman's innocently cunning ways, and I know it was in your dear mother's heart that, through you, your uncle should be won over to us. But the hopes in which we indulged were not realized. Your uncle was true to his word. It used to be said of him as a boy that he would die rather than break it--in which, when it becomes fixed in an earnest nature, there is sometimes a touch of folly or injustice--and I can recall many small incidents as a proof of his possession of this quality.\"\n\n\"But he has written to you at last, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, Nansie.\"\n\n\"In a kindly spirit?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am thankful to say.\"\n\n\"This is good. Is my uncle married?\"\n\n\"No. In our last interview he vowed that he would never marry, and I doubt whether he would ever have yielded to the sentiment of love had his heart been again that way inclined. I deeply regret it. Life without love is at best a barren affair.\"\n\nWith a sweet look Nansie raised her dewy eyes to his. He divined what, in the darkness, he could not clearly see.\n\n\"It must be an honorable, honest, earnest love, child. You understand that?\"\n\n\"I understand it, father.\"\n\n\"We will renew the subject another time. I am tired, and night has fallen. It is almost like summer--the sweetest spring in my remembrance. There is a fascination in shadows--spiritual suggestions and possibilities which cannot occur to the mind in sunlight. The night is dark and beautiful:\n\n\"Life is a dream, dear child. May yours be a happy one!\"\n\nThen they did not speak for many minutes, and then it was Nansie's voice that was first heard.\n\n\"What did you say to my uncle in the letter you wrote to him, father?\"\n\n\"I spoke to him of my illness, and of you. When your mother died I wrote informing him; but he took no notice of my letter. This time I appealed to him. I said, if anything happened to me you would be without a home. His answer is that you can find a home with him. My mind is greatly relieved. Now, my dear child, we will retire.\"\n\n\"I will see to the beds, father. I shall not be long.\"\n\nShe ascended the little flight of wooden steps, and the next moment a light from within the caravan was shining through one of the windows. This delightfully primitive dwelling-house contained three rooms or compartments. One was the kitchen, where the meals were cooked, and, in bad weather, partaken of. The other two were the sleeping-apartments of Nansie and her father. In each of these bedrooms was a window with a double sash, opening up and down.\n\nThe beds were soon ready, and then Nansie called her father. He ascended the steps, and, pulling them up after him, made them fast. Father and daughter were thus in a stronghold, as it were, safe from invasion. Before entering the castle Mr. Loveday had seen that the old horse was safe, and had tethered it by a rope to one of the wheels. Then, kissing Nansie with much tenderness, he retired to rest. He slept in the back room, Nansie in the front, and the only means of ingress and egress was the back door in Mr. Loveday's bedroom. Thus he served as a kind of watch-dog to his daughter. She, partly disrobing, sat awhile by the open window, looking out upon the shadows. She had much to think of--her father's illness, their worldly circumstances, her absent lover; but her mind was as healthy as her body, and she looked upon all things hopefully. She did not muse long; finishing her preparations for bed, she closed the windows, and slid between the sheets. She slept for an hour, and awoke; slept again for a little while, and again awoke. This was not her usual habit; as a rule she could sleep seven or eight hours at a stretch. Perhaps she was listening for the nightingale's song. It came, and she listened in delight to the bird of love calling for its mate; and as she lay awake another sound reached her ears, as of a heavy body moving softly outside. It was not the old horse. What could it be? She slipped out of bed, and listened at the door which led from her room to her father's. She heard his soft breathing; he seemed to be peacefully sleeping. Presently, as she stood in darkness, she heard a whispering voice which caused her heart to throb wild with joy.\n\n\"Nansie!\"\n\nShe glided to the window and raised the lower sash.\n\n\"Kingsley!\" she whispered, musically, in reply.\n\n\"You are here, my darling! I have found you!\"\n\n\"Hush! Speak softly, or you will awake my father. What a time to come! How good you are!\"\n\n\"I received your letter and telegram, and could not rest What a hunt I have had for you! I must speak to you, Nansie. Can't you come out?\"\n\n\"Not to-night, Kingsley; it is impossible. Oh, Kingsley, how happy you have made me!\"\n\n\"What else do I live for? But I must speak to you, I say. I cannot wait.\"\n\n\"You must--till to-morrow morning. Listen to the nightingale. Is it not sweet?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning, you say. An eternity! How am I to be sure you will not disappear before then?\"\n\n\"I shall be here, in the woods, at sunrise. Could I keep away, knowing you were waiting for me? There--you make me say foolish things!\"\n\n\"Give me your hand, Nansie.\"\n\nShe put her hand out of the window; her white arm was partly bared by the loosened sleeve. He, standing on the spoke of the wheel, took her hand and kissed it, and then did not relinquish it.\n\n\"You are well, Nansie?\"\n\n\"Yes, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"Quite well?\"\n\n\"Quite well.\"\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"He is not well, I grieve to say.\"\n\n\"We will make him so, you and I. But what a freak--to live like this!\"\n\n\"It is delightful.\"\n\n\"Without me?\"\n\n\"I mean now that you are here. Good-night, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"A moment yet. I will wait till the nightingale has finished its song.\"\n\n\"You foolish Kingsley! It will sing for hours.\"\n\n\"Nansie, I have so much to tell you!\"\n\n\"And I to tell you; but this is not the time. To-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow at sunrise.\" He kissed her hand again. \"Nansie, my father has arrived home.\"\n\n\"At last!\" There was a tremor of apprehension in her voice. \"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But he has sent for me, and I am going to him after seeing you to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Where will you sleep, Kingsley?\"\n\n\"I have a bed at Godalming; but I am in no humor for sleep.\"\n\n\"Be reasonable, Kingsley, if you love me.\" She leaned forward, raised his hand to her lips, and kissed it. \"Now are you content?\"\n\n\"I should be false to you if I were to say I am. There, I have given you back your hand. Are you content?\"\n\n\"It is yours forever and ever. Good-night, my love!\"\n\n\"Good-night, my heart! To-morrow at sunrise. Mind--not a moment later! Do not close the window yet.\"\n\nHe managed to pluck some daisies, and he threw them up at her. She caught them, and even in the dark she could distinguish the golden tufts within their silver crowns.\n\n\"Good-night, my love,\" she sighed again, pressing the flowers to her lips.\n\n\"Good-night, my heart!\"\n\nShe listened to the last faint echo of his footfall, and then she sought her bed, and, smiling happily, fell asleep, with the daisies on her pillow.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nBetween midnight and sunrise a slight shower had fallen, scarcely damping the ground, but sufficient to draw out the perfume of the young flowers. The promise of spring was fulfilled, and tender bloom peeped up in places, and in others showed itself more boldly. About the trunks of ancient trees the sweet woodruff lurked; in sunny hedges the \"cuckoo buds of yellow hue\" proclaimed themselves; the heart-shaped leaves of the Irish shamrock were slowly unfolding; species of wild geranium and the strangely shaped orchises were abundant, the general commonwealth being represented by myriads of golden buttercups. Nansie and Kingsley stood near a great hawthorn, not yet in full bud, but already emitting a deliciously fine fragrance born of the light rain which had fallen during the night.\n\n\"Why, Nansie,\" Kingsley was saying to her, \"I never suspected you had gypsy blood in you.\"\n\n\"I have none, as you know,\" was her response. \"It was my father's whim, for which, I dare say, if he were here and was inclined to do so, he could give you several reasons. You can guess some of them, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"The first and foremost is that he wished to keep us apart. He has not succeeded. I would hunt you all over the world, Nansie.\"\n\n\"You must not be unjust to my father,\" said Nansie, \"He was always full of fancies, Kingsley, but never harbored a bad one; and you must remember he does not know our secret yet. I love and honor him; he is a good man.\"\n\n\"Or you could not have been his daughter. Full of fancies, indeed!\" And Kingsley turned his head in the direction of the caravan. \"Surely this is the strangest that ever entered the head of man! A gentleman and a scholar--for he is both, Nansie, and I suppose it was partly through your breeding that I was drawn to you--to go wandering through the land with his daughter, as though they belonged to the lost tribes! But there is an odd pleasantry about it that tickles one, after all.\"\n\n\"You would enjoy it, Kingsley,\" said Nansie, with a delicious laugh, nestling close to him; \"it has really been delightful.\"\n\n\"Ah, you said that last night, and I asked you, in surprise, how it could have been, without me?\"\n\n\"And I did not have wit enough to answer you properly. Think of the hour! I was scarcely half awake. And Kingsley, having the fullest trust in you, which nothing ever can shake, you would not wish me to be unhappy even when we are parted. I can think of you in a happy mood when you are not with me, if only by looking forward to the time when we shall always be together. It will be soon, will it not?\"\n\n\"It must, it shall, either way,\" he replied; \"but I do not think I was wrong in asking you to wait a little while.\"\n\n\"You have done everything for the best, so far as I am concerned-- But for yourself!\" Nansie paused and sighed.\n\n\"But for myself,\" he said, taking up her words, \"I have done that which is happiest and best, and that which falls to the lot of few men.\"\n\n\"Ah, Kingsley?\" she said, hiding her face on his shoulder.\n\n\"I have won a faithful heart. What more could I desire?\"\n\n\"It is sweet to hear you say so; but if your father should be angry--\"\n\n\"What then? We are young and strong and willing, and shall be able to manage. I have friends who will give me a helping hand, as I would give them were our places changed. New men spring up every day, Nansie; the ladder is full of them, rising higher and higher. Why should I not be one of them? Why should I not be fortunate--in money, I mean; I am content with everything else--as my father was? When he was my age he had little more than I have. See what he is now. A power, mixing with those who bear historic names. And there are others as he is. The old ranks are widening, new men creep in, hold their heads high, and occupy positions of power and profit. The question will presently be, who are the masters? No, no, Nansie, I don't despair. I should not be worthy of you if I did. What ennobles a man? Rank? Hardly. He can prove himself worthy of it--that is all; then he may consider himself truly distinguished. Rank is mortal. Love is immortal. Ask the poets. Not that they know much better than any one else. After all, it is the heart that should be followed.\"\n\n\"I have followed mine,\" said Nansie, looking fondly at him.\n\nShe did not understand the drift of all he said, nor, indeed, did he himself, nor was he aware that his speech was of a wandering nature. He spoke enthusiastically, and sometimes he ran his fingers through his hair; and although he did this rather perplexedly, there was no indication in his manner of any want of confidence in himself or his opinions. When Nansie said she had followed her heart, he kissed her and said:\n\n\"And I followed mine; it led me here to your side, my dearest, and I am happy. This is the loveliest morning! The rain has sweetened everything--for us! You are teaching me things, Nansie. I had no idea the early morning was so beautiful. The flowers, the dew--it is wonderful. If I were a poet I should say the earth was covered with jewels.\"\n\n\"You are a poet, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"No, no; I see things through your eyes. It is you who are the poet. But I have written verses, too. The fellows say poetry doesn't pay, and you must not encourage me. We must be sensibly worldly. What some of the fellows used to say was that I was prone to be discursive, but they were not judges. Between you and me, they were a little jealous because I could talk. Well, the gift of oratory is not a bad one--I don't say I have it, but I am seldom at a loss for words. It may not be a gift--it may be an art which a man may cultivate. That brings me back to my father. He was always fond of hearing me talk. He has often said, 'Talk away, Kingsley; you shall be in the House one day.' You know what I mean by the House, Nansie?--Parliament.\"\n\n\"I like to hear you speak of your father, Kingsley, and that he loves you.\"\n\n\"He does, sincerely. He says I am to do great things, and that all his hopes are centred in me. Why do you sigh, Nansie?\"\n\n\"Did I sigh, Kingsley?\" she asked, with feminine duplicity. \"It must be because I am overjoyed that we are together.\"\n\n\"Dear girl! The reason I ramble on so about my father is because I wish you to know him thoroughly. He is very practical--so am I. Sentiment does not run in our family. Only he must be humored, because everything depends upon him. He is rather proud; he has a right to be so, being a self-made man. And obstinate; so am I. You do not know all sides of me yet, Nansie. I have heard it said of a man who has raised himself by his own exertions: 'Oh, he is only a man who has made money!' Now that is an exhibition of ignorance. For a man who was once poor to become a magnate--well, there is an element of romance in it. Look at Whittington. My father was a poor boy; his parents were poor, and could not afford to give him a good education. What he knows he has learned since he became a man. That opens up the question whether it was of any use sending me to college; whether a mistake was not made in not throwing me upon the world, as he was thrown? He has spoken to me of the philosopher's stone, and said he found it when he was young. 'Make use of others,' he says, and has furnished illustrations. 'Take a thousand workingmen,' he says, 'bricklayers, stonemasons, carpenters, anything. They work a certain number of hours per day for a certain number of shillings per week. So manage that from their labor you reap a profit of half an hour a day out of each man. That is a profit of five hundred hours per day for the organizer. At eight working hours per day you thus put, roughly speaking, into your pocket the earnings of sixty men out of the thousand.' That is the way in which my father became a contractor. Bridges, canals, foreign railways, he has made them all, and has had as many as eight thousand men working for him at one time. And all out of nothing. But this is prosaic stuff. Let us talk of ourselves. Your father is ill, you said. What is the matter with him?\"\n\n\"He suffers from his heart, Kingsley; I am in deep distress about him.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is frightening himself unnecessarily, my dear. He must consult the best physicians. Thorough rest, freedom from anxiety, a warmer climate--leave it to me, Nansie. It is only a matter of money.\"\n\nNansie thought with sadness of the disclosure made by her father of the extent of his worldly resources, and at that moment the subject of her thoughts made his appearance. Mr. Loveday did not betray surprise at finding his daughter with Kingsley, but she blushed scarlet when she saw him, and Kingsley was not free from a certain embarrassment.\n\n\"You rose before me this morning,\" said Mr. Loveday to Nansie. \"Have you been out long?\"\n\n\"About half an hour, father,\" she replied.\n\n\"You have not met Mr. Manners by accident,\" he observed.\n\n\"No, father; Kingsley and I made the appointment last night.\"\n\n\"Last night! At what strange hour, then, and where?\" Kingsley looked at her encouragingly, and whispered: \"Be brave. I will tell him all.\"\n\nThis gave her courage.\n\n\"The appointment, father,\" she said, archly, \"was made last night when the nightingale was singing.\"\n\nHe allowed his eyes to rest for a brief space upon hers, and he saw truth and innocence so clearly depicted therein that a deep breath escaped him, as though a weight had been lifted off his heart. But this assurance of his daughter's guilelessness was another argument against the man who, in the father's opinion, was playing upon her feelings.\n\n\"Go and prepare breakfast, Nansie,\" said Mr. Loveday. \"I will join you presently.\"\n\n\"And Kingsley?\" she asked. \"He will also come?\"\n\n\"We shall see, we shall see,\" said Mr. Loveday, fretfully. \"He and I have much to say to each other.\"\n\n\"But I shall expect him,\" she said, kissing her father; then, with a bright look at Kingsley, she departed.\n\n\"It was the only way to get rid of her,\" said Mr. Loveday, with a look of displeasure at the young man. \"Even a father is compelled sometimes to practise deceit in his dealings with his children.\"\n\nThe implied accusation in this remark was acknowledged by Kingsley in silence. Impulsive and wayward as he was, he was apt to resent an imputation reflecting upon his honor.\n\n\"But then,\" continued Mr. Loveday, \"a father is often justified in his deceit, especially in such a case as this, when he has to deal with a young and inexperienced girl.\"\n\nHis manner was as unfortunate as his matter, and it was impossible to mistake his meaning; but Kingsley exhibited no resentment.\n\n\"You are bringing an accusation against me, sir,\" he said. \"The least you can do is to set it forth in plain terms.\"\n\n\"I will do so. Were I disposed to be lenient--which I am not, because the welfare of my daughter is too near to my heart--I should call your conduct rash and inconsiderate. As it is, I have no hesitation in declaring it to be criminal.\"\n\n\"I am glad Nansie is not present to hear you, sir.\"\n\n\"I, also, am glad. You know as well as I do that I would not dare to speak so plainly were she here. I should have to temporize with her--in plainer terms, to use some of the arts you have used to entangle her.\"\n\n\"Have I used such arts to such a purpose?\" asked Kingsley. He was not accustomed to be addressed in such a manner and to be misjudged so promptly. \"You make me aware of it for the first time.\"\n\n\"Use none with me; be straightforward, if it is in your power. I am my daughter's protector, and I intend to protect her with firmness and authority.\" And yet as he spoke he pressed his hand to his heart, and looked before him apprehensively for a moment with the manner of a man to whom a spiritual warning had presented itself. Firm and confident as he endeavored to make his speech, he felt his powerlessness. He was a beggar, and the shadow of death hovered over him. Nevertheless he bravely pursued what he conceived to be his duty. \"I have called your conduct criminal. You have some knowledge of the world. In what other words would you describe the behavior of a young man of fashion--you see I do you justice--\"\n\n\"You do not,\" interrupted Kingsley, \"you do me a gross injustice, as you will be compelled to acknowledge before we have done.\"\n\n\"How other than criminal is the conduct of a young man of fashion when he makes an appointment with a pure and innocent girl such as this in which I have surprised you? What construction would the world place upon it?\"\n\n\"I care little for the world, sir, where my affections are concerned.\"\n\n\"That is to say, that you care little for the consequences of wrong-doing. I know, I know; it is the fashion of your set.\"\n\n\"Upon my honor, sir,\" said Kingsley, warmly, \"I cannot make up my mind how to take you. The attitude you have assumed rather puts me on my mettle, and though I could easily disarm you, perhaps it is as well that I should first hear you out.\"\n\n\"The attitude you assume, young gentleman, is an utterly unwarrantable one. I am speaking strongly, I admit, but I am justified by my duty as a parent.\"\n\n\"And yet, sir, I may have equal justice on my side.\"\n\n\"There can be no question of equality in this matter.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Kingsley--hurt as he was, his bearing towards Nansie's father was, if not deferential, respectful--\"I thought this was a matter of the affections.\" And, conscious of his integrity, he could not help adding: \"Shall your daughter be the judge, sir, between us?\"\n\nIn Mr. Loveday's eyes this was an added offence.\n\n\"It is an unworthy challenge, Mr. Manners. It is not difficult for an inexperienced girl to choose between a lover and a father. Old affections, old ties, all records of a parent's anxious care, fade into nothingness when her heart is touched by the new love.\" He spoke now plaintively, and he noted the sympathizing look in Kingsley's face. It inspired him with hope; his voice became more gentle, his manner more appealing. \"Mr. Manners, have pity on me. Let us speak as honest man to honest man.\"\n\n\"Agreed, sir,\" said Kingsley, heartily.\n\n\"My daughter is a poor girl; I am a poor man, and have been so all my life. There is no great misfortune in this; as much happiness is to be found in the ranks of the poor as in the ranks of the rich. When, some short time since, it first came to my knowledge that my daughter entertained an affection for you, there was but one course open to me--to effect a separation between you, in the hope that time and distance might work a healthful cure, and cause her to forget you.\"\n\n\"But why, sir?\" asked Kingsley, with smiling eyes.\n\n\"You ask why? Surely you can yourself supply the answer. There is between you a disparity which renders it impossible that any good can spring from such an affection.\"\n\n\"No, no, sir; not impossible. Pardon me for interrupting you.\"\n\n\"I, as a matter of course, can form some reasonable conception of the future that lies before my child. She is poor; she will live among the poor; it is her lot, and not a hard one. It is only temptation, it is only a longing for what is out of her reach, that is likely to spoil her life, as it has spoiled the lives of many who have not had the strength to resist. Will you help to spoil the life of a child who is very dear to me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kingsley, fervently, \"as Heaven is my judge, no!\"\n\n\"Mr. Manners,\" said Mr. Loveday, holding out his hand to the young man, \"you said a moment or two since that I was doing you an injustice, and that I should be compelled to acknowledge it. I acknowledge it now, and I ask your pardon. You have been simply thoughtless. The time may come when, with children of your own to protect, you will look back to this meeting with satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I shall always do that, sir. And now, sir, as we are on better terms, I may ask what it is you expect of me.\"\n\n\"That you never see my daughter more; that you give me your promise not to intrude yourself upon her, nor write to her, and in that way help her in the task that lies before her, the task of forgetfulness.\"\n\n\"A hard task, sir.\"\n\n\"It may be, and all the sweeter when it is accomplished, because of the dangers from which its performance saves her. You promise me this?\"\n\n\"A moment, sir. If your daughter and I had been equal in station--which we are not; she is far above me.\" Being more at his ease, he relapsed now into his old manner of discursiveness. \"If you knew me better you would excuse me for flying off at a tangent. It is a butterfly habit of mine, though I hope there is something of the grub in me! It may be needed by and by. If, as I was about to say, your daughter and I were equal in worldly station, both being equally poor or equally rich, and I asked you for her hand, would you refuse it to me?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Mr. Loveday. \"But knowing so little of you it would be necessary that I should know more, that I should be to some extent satisfied as to your past life.\"\n\n\"And your inquiries in that respect being satisfactory,\" interrupted Kingsley, \"you would not refuse?\"\n\n\"My daughter's heart should decide for me.\"\n\n\"Let it decide for you now, sir,\" said Kingsley, in a tone both light and earnest. \"No, do not take it amiss that I make this proposition, but listen to me a moment. Hitherto I have been pretty well thrust aside in this matter, as if I were a bit of stone, without feelings, or something very nearly resembling a monster with them. I am quite conscious that I am of an erratic disposition, flying hither and thither as the whim seizes me--almost as bad, my dear sir, as your eccentric wanderings in a caravan--but I am not at all conscious that I have any very distinct vice in me; the explanation of which may be that I lack strength of character, a proof that it is as undesirable in one man as it is desirable in another. I am not speaking in praise of myself, except perhaps in a negative way, which is not much to one's credit. Though I may tell you, sir, that I have not unfrequently been called a radical, and a radical is a personage. What I am endeavoring to express is that I have feelings, and that I should prefer rather to be happy than miserable. There is nothing unreasonable in that, I hope.\"\n\nAs he paused for a reply, Mr. Loveday, somewhat mystified, said: \"No, there is nothing unreasonable in such a desire.\"\n\n\"That much being admitted,\" continued Kingsley, \"I repeat my request that your daughter's heart should decide for you, as you would allow it to decide for you if you supposed me to be a poor man. And this sends me flying off again. My father is a rich man; I am nothing but what he makes me. If he were to turn me off, my entire worldly wealth would consist of an inconsiderable sum of six hundred pounds, the whole of which would be swallowed up in paying my debts. Give me credit for frankness, sir.\"\n\n\"I do. Your frankness convinces me that for your own sake, as well as for my daughter's, it is best that you and she should not meet again.\"\n\n\"But she expects me, sir, and in your company. I would wager that she has prepared breakfast for me-- There, sir, don't turn impatiently away; it is the fault of my temperament that I can be light and serious in a breath, that I can mean much and seem to mean little. This I promise. If you will allow me to accompany you to the caravan, where your daughter is waiting for us, I will abide by your decision, to be arrived at within five short minutes after we are together, as to whether I shall remain to breakfast or bid you farewell. Come, sir, I can't speak fairer.\"\n\nThere was an irresistible ingenuousness in Kingsley's voice and manner, and Mr. Loveday led the way to the caravan. Breakfast was laid, and Nansie, busy within the dwelling-house on wheels, cried out in the cheerfullest of voices:\n\n\"Is that you, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, Nansie,\" said Mr. Loveday.\n\n\"And Kingsley?\"\n\n\"Yes, Nansie,\" said the young man. \"Never mind the teapot. Come out at once; I have only five minutes' grace.\"\n\nNansie immediately ran down the little flight of wooden steps, and looked from one to the other of the men, both so dear to her.\n\n\"Nansie,\" said Kingsley, \"I said that I would tell your father all. Forgive me; I have not done so.\"\n\n\"Why, Kingsley?\"\n\n\"Because I left it to you.\"\n\n\"I may speak, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd now there were tears in Nansie's eyes, happy tears. She approached closer to her father and took his hand.\n\n\"You said last night, father, that you thought I had a secret which I was keeping from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, child.\"\n\n\"I had; but I had given Kingsley a promise not to reveal it without his permission. I have his permission now, and I will tell it.\" Her bosom heaved, her lips trembled; she gazed fondly at her father.\n\n\"Well, child?\"\n\n\"You will not be angry, father?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Nansie.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Nansie--her arms were round his neck, and her face half hidden on his breast--\"Kingsley and I are married.\"\n\n\"Married!\" cried Mr. Loveday, in a tone of wondering happiness.\n\n\"Yes, dear, married. Kingsley thought it best to wait until his father, who has been for some time abroad, returned home before we made it known; but I am glad that you know it earlier--glad and happy, my dear father. I wrote to Kingsley--I could not help it, father; I was afraid of losing him, we were wandering about so--and he came last night, when you were asleep. I was awake, listening to the nightingale. Kingsley being outside and I in, we could not talk comfortably together; that is how we met this morning at sunrise. You will forgive us, father, will you not?\"\n\n\"Forgive you, dear child!\" said Mr. Loveday, holding out his hand to Kingsley, who took it and pressed it warmly. \"What can I have to forgive, seeing you and Kingsley so happy, and knowing that you have a protector? It is I who should ask forgiveness of him.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear sir, not at all,\" cried Kingsley, hastily. \"I was to blame for allowing you to labor a moment under a misapprehension.\"\n\n\"My dear Nansie! my dear, dear child!\" murmured the happy father. Then, turning to Kingsley: \"When do you expect your father home?\" As he asked the question his face became grave. He saw the difficulties in their way.\n\n\"He has arrived, sir. I had a letter from him yesterday, and I am going to him, to confess all. It was partly that, and partly because of Nansie's letter, but chiefly because I could not exist without seeing her before I went to my father, which brought me here. But, sir, my father is not the question.\"\n\n\"What is, then, Kingsley?\" asked Mr. Loveday, still very grave.\n\n\"The question is, whether you are going to ask me to stay to breakfast with you.\"\n\nMr. Loveday brightened; there was something contagious in the young man's gay spirits.\n\n\"I invite you, Kingsley,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you, sir; I am famished, Nansie.\"\n\nStanding upon the wooden steps, she turned and gazed fondly at her father and her husband, and as her bright eyes shone upon them there issued from a thicket of trees a most wonderful chorus of birds. And Mr. Loveday, quoting from his favorite poet, said:\n\nAnd Nansie, going slowly into the caravan, thought that life was very sweet and the world very beautiful.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOn the evening of the following day Kingsley arrived at his father's house in London. It was situated in the centre of fashion, and had been built by the rich contractor himself upon part of a freehold which he had purchased upon terms so advantageous that, as he was in the habit of boasting, his own mansion \"stood him in next to nothing,\" occasionally adding that he could find a purchaser for it at a day's notice for seventy-five thousand pounds. He was fond of dealing in large sums even in figures of speech, and he was to some extent justified in this habit by the circumstances of his career.\n\nIt was a wonderful career, commencing with nothing and marching into millions. A poor boy, doubly orphaned and thrown upon the world before he could stand upright, without a friend, without a penny, without shoes to his feet, he had grown somehow into a sturdy manhood, and when he was twenty years of age he stood six feet two in his stockings, and could fell an ox with his fist. Therefore, even at that humble period in his career, he was renowned among his fellows, and held a distinguished position. No man could equal him in strength; many tried and were laid low; giants travelled from afar to try conclusions with Val Manners, and all met with the same fate. Had he cared he might have developed into the greatest prizefighter the world had ever known, and have worn diamonded belts and jewelled stars, and become as a king among men. Newspapers would have heralded his doings in large type; he could have travelled in state like an ambassador; he might have exhibited himself and earned a princely income; the aristocracy would have patted his broad back, and titled ladies would have cast admiring glances at him. For this is the age of muscle as well as intellect, and a bully may take rank with Homer.\n\nBut Val Manners was not a bully, and his tastes were not for the prize-ring. He was proud of his great strength, because it gave him the mastery, and he used it upon needed occasions to maintain his position; but he did not love fighting for fighting's sake. In his early life he knew that he had biceps of steel and a constitution which defied wind and weather; but he did not know that he had a subtle brain and a talent for administration which were to lead him to eminence and enormous wealth. This knowledge dawned upon him afterwards, when he began to make successes, when he began to gauge men and understand them.\n\nHe commenced life as a bricklayer, and even as a boy his strength and fearlessness were quoted, and he found himself in demand. He did not seem to know what fear was; he could climb the shakiest and tallest of ladders, carrying wonderful weights; he could stand upon dizzy heights and look smilingly down. His possession of these qualities caused him to be selected for dangerous tasks, and he was never known to shrink from one, however perilous. All this time he earned barely sufficient to appease his enormous appetite. He received no education, but he had a native gift of figures. It was not till he reached his third decade that he could read and write. Long before that, however, his arithmetical talents had laid the foundation of his fortune. It was a fortune made partly out of stone and metal, but chiefly out of other men's labor.\n\nChance threw into his way a small contract. A retired pawnbroker wanted a house built in North Islington, and was not satisfied with the estimates he received from established firms. \"It ought to be done for seven and a half per cent. less,\" said he, and he called Val Manners to his aid, having had occasion to observe the calm and skilful manner in which the young artisan went about his work. \"He does the work of two men,\" said the pawnbroker, \"and is probably paid for the work of one.\" He ascertained, upon inquiry, that this was the case; Val Manners, working so many hours a day, was paid so much a week. It was not that, out of boastfulness, he desired to do more work in a given time than comrades less strong and capable than himself, it was simply that he did his work honestly without regard to comparisons. The pawnbroker discovered in his first interview with Val Manners that the huge, common-looking man had a head for figures. He put the matter of his house before Val Manners, and asked him to prepare an estimate. The result was that Val Manners threw up his situation, and became a master builder in a small way; the result also was that the pawnbroker got his house built for twelve per cent, less than the lowest of the estimates submitted to him by old-established firms.\n\nIn this first operation the brain power of Val Manners made itself manifest. He worked himself, of course, and thereby saved one man's labor; this went into his own pocket. Indeed, being stirred and excited by this higher flight into life's struggles, he worked harder than had been his usual habit, and may be said to have done the work of at least two men and a half in the building of the pawnbroker's house; and this extra money also went into his pocket. Then, again, in the selection of men but of work who applied to be taken on, he chose the strongest, and, being always on the spot, saw that he was not cheated out of a quarter of an hour by one and ten minutes by another. Thus, when the contract was finished, he was a great many days to the good, and he found that he was richer by sixty pounds than he would have been had he continued to be a servant. This set him thinking.\n\nThe pawnbroker was so satisfied with the bargain that he proposed the building of a row of houses in a poor locality. Val Manners was ready and glad, and pursued the same tactics as before, and worked harder than ever. The second contract being finished to everybody's satisfaction, Val Manners reckoned up his gains. He was master of a capital of three hundred pounds.\n\nFrom this point his career was a succession of triumphs, until his capital amounted to a hundred thousand pounds. It was wonderful how his money accumulated; it grew while he slept, for he often had relays of men working for him by night as well as by day. He was a hard taskmaster, perfectly just in his dealings, keeping to his word and his engagements with unerring fidelity, but exacting from those in his employ an absolute faithfulness, the least infringement of which meant instant dismissal. It was no longer Val Manners, but Mr. Manners, the great Mr. Manners, who had plumped into the very richest part of a Tom Tiddler's ground open to every enterprising man, and picked and pocketed the plums growing therein. He did not allow himself to become bewildered by his success, but pursued his way calmly and masterfully as regarded his own undertakings, and with a vigilant watchfulness which frequently turned a probable loss into a certain profit. He undertook no more small contracts; all his business dealings were now on a vast scale, and no project was too stupendous for him to grapple with. It was not England alone that supplied his master mind with material to expend its energies upon; he sought abroad for contracts, and laid railways in deserts, built huge bridges touching the clouds, and made wonderful waterways for facilities of commerce. He became world-renowned, and the name of Manners, the great contractor, was a passport in every part of the globe.\n\nIt was to his advantage that he married young, his partner being no other than the daughter of his first patron, the pawnbroker. She was not in any sense a remarkable person, but she had an ambition to shine in society, and it was from her that Mr. Manners received the limited education which enabled him, at thirty years of age, to read and write. His ideal as to social position also grew with his wealth; but he had tact enough to understand that it was not possible for him to occupy a foremost position as a public leader. This, however, did not prevent him from building a grand house in the heart of fashionable London, nor from mixing among the best. He was not out of place there, for he had the rare wisdom of being able to hold his tongue, and never to speak assertively except upon the business with which he was familiar. On those occasions he was listened to with respect and deference, and his words had weight; he trod upon no man's corns by expressing opinions upon matters of which he had not made himself master; he was content that his works should speak for him. Eloquent, indeed, was the record which, so far as he himself was concerned, he bore about him in silence. The railroads he had constructed in savage countries, the seas he had joined, were not these matters of history? And he, whose constructive and administrative talents had compassed these difficulties, became in a sense historical. Stories were related of his great courage, of his amazing strength, of his daring and skill in moments of difficulty, putting his own shoulders to the wheel and showing his workmen how a thing was to be done. Women love the personification of strength in a man; it means power, manliness, nobility, in their eyes; and numbers gazed in admiration upon the massive frame of the great contractor for whom no undertaking was too vast. He was a striking figure in fashionable assemblies, towering above all, and moving like a mountain through the packed crowd of male and female exquisites. He only moved when he had occasion; he had not within him that restless, fretful spirit which weakens the character of many men; as he knew the value of silence, so also did he know the value of repose. In all gatherings of men and women the art of standing still with dignity and without self-consciousness is invaluable. This art Mr. Manners possessed, so that, taking him for all in all, he was no charlatan, trading upon false pretences.\n\nThe day previous to that upon which Kingsley entered his father's house, with the intention of making a clean breast of it with respect to Nansie, Mr. Manners himself had returned from Russia where he had been for five months superintending a railway contract for the Russian government, which he had brought to a successful conclusion.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nFather and son greeted each other cordially, but after the undemonstrative manner of Englishmen.\n\n\"Well, father?\"\n\n\"Well, Kingsley?\"\n\nThen they shook hands, and smiled and nodded at each other.\n\n\"Has everything gone off well, father?\"\n\n\"Everything. The balance on the right side will be larger than I expected.\"\n\n\"That is better than being the other way.\"\n\n\"Perhaps; but I prefer matters to come out exactly as I planned them. It is altogether more satisfactory. I will tell you all about it to-night, when we must have a long talk. I have a lot of letters to attend to now.\"\n\nKingsley took the hint, and, after seeing his mother, went to his room. The first thing he did there was to take out Nansie's portrait and gaze fondly on it and kiss it. He had parted from her and her father in the morning, and had promised to write to her before he went to bed. As he had an hour now to spare, he thought he could not better employ it than in covering four sheets of paper to the girl he loved, so he sat down and enjoyed himself to his heart's content. His letter was full of the usual lover's rhapsodies, and need not here be transcribed. There was in it something better than rhapsodies, the evidence of an earnest, faithful spirit, which made it the sweetest of reading to Nansie when she received it on the following day. Kingsley mentioned that he and his father were to have a long talk together that night, and that, if he found a favorable opportunity, he would take advantage of it to make confession to his father; also if he had any good news to communicate, he might write again before he went to bed. And then, with fond and constant love and untold kisses, he was forever and ever her faithful lover, and so on, and so on. Very precious and comforting are these lovers' sweet trivialities.\n\nDinner over, Kingsley and his father sat together in the contractor's study, at a table upon which were wine and cigars. Mr. Manners drank always in great moderation, and did not smoke. Kingsley's habits were after a freer fashion, and his father did not disapprove. The first hour was occupied in a description by Mr. Manners of the operations in which he had been engaged in Russia, and of the difficulties which he had to surmount. He made light of these, but he was proud of his last success.\n\n\"There were mountains to cut through, Kingsley,\" he said, \"and Russian prejudices to overcome; I hardly know which of the two was the more difficult job.\"\n\n\"There were dangers, father, as well as difficulties,\" observed Kingsley.\n\n\"Yes, there were dangers; you have heard something of them?\"\n\n\"I have seen accounts in the papers from time to time. You see, father, the railway you have laid down is a step nearer to India.\"\n\n\"I am pleased to hear you say that, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Kingsley, rather surprised.\n\n\"Because it shows you take an interest in politics.\"\n\n\"I have done that for some time past, as you know, father.\"\n\n\"Yes, and it pleases me. A step nearer to India. That is so, but it is no business of mine. It may,\" with a light touch of his finger on his son's breast, \"by and by be business of yours, when you are a statesman. About the dangers? What did you read?\"\n\n\"There were pestilent morasses to be bridged over or cut through, and there was great loss of life.\"\n\n\"Quite correct; the mortality was serious; fortunately I employed native labor.\"\n\n\"But it was human life, father, whether Russian or English.\"\n\n\"Quite true again, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"Holding views as I do, father,\" said Kingsley, \"there appears to me something anomalous--that is putting it very mildly--in this last operation of yours.\"\n\nMr. Manners smiled good-humoredly, and nodded his head in pleasant approval.\n\n\"Go on, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"For instance, the matter of Russia's nearer approach to India being facilitated by an Englishman. Is not that anomalous?\"\n\n\"No more anomalous than selling Russia a few millions of our best rifles and a few hundred millions of our best bullets.\"\n\n\"Would you do that?\"\n\n\"I should like to get the contract.\"\n\nKingsley shifted uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"It is either right or wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"Being at peace with Russia, Kingsley, it is right. Of course, it would be wrong if we were at war with the country.\"\n\n\"But we provide it with rifles and bullets and railways beforehand.\"\n\n\"Quite so--in the way of business. I like a conversation such as this, Kingsley, in which there is no need for anything to be settled. As to the future before you, it doesn't matter to me which side you take, so long as you become what I hope you will be. Men like myself, sprung from the ranks and making such fortunes as I have made, generally become Conservatives. I am neither one thing nor another, and shall not attempt to dictate to you. But into this question of bullets and rifles and railways let us import a little common-sense. If that sort of trading is wrong in times of peace, every country would have to cut itself aloof from every other country, and to live as if it were shut up in a box. I can't express myself as well as you, but I dare say you understand me.\"\n\n\"You can always make people understand you, father,\" said Kingsley.\n\n\"Yes, I have always been able to do that. They respect you all the more for it.\" Here he laughed quite gayly. \"Even in Russia, where I did not know one word of the language, I made myself understood. I saw some great people there, Kingsley, and had interviews with them. Of course, I had a man to interpret for me, but I think I could have managed even without him. Some of the great men spoke English, but not a laborer I employed did. It was no more necessary for them to know our language, than for me to know theirs. The point was that there was work to do, and that it must be done within the stipulated time. With a stern master over him the Russian is a good workman, and values his life less than an Englishman. Take the pestilential ground we had to work over. No English workman would remain there a day; the Russian shrugged his shoulders and took the risk. Now, Kingsley, we will proceed to matters more immediately concerning ourselves.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, father.\"\n\n\"As between father and son there should be as few secrets as possible. You have some knowledge of my career; it is one I have no need to be ashamed of, and I propose to commence with the story of my life, and to make you fully acquainted with the secret of my rise in the world.\"\n\nUpon that Mr. Manners entered unreservedly upon his relation, and spoke of matters in respect of his successful struggles with which the reader is already familiar. It was not all new to Kingsley, but he listened patiently and admiringly.\n\n\"I think I have made it plain to you, Kingsley,\" said Mr. Manners, when he had finished the recital, \"that I owe everything to myself. I make no boast of it, and I have no doubt there are numbers of men as capable and clever as I am, only they have either not had the courage to launch out or have missed their opportunities. Now, my lad, I am sensible of my own deficiencies; I do not deceive myself by saying that I am as good as others with whom my money places me on an equality; I am a contractor, nothing more, and every shoemaker to his last. I shall stick to mine, and make more money. If I entered Parliament, which I could do without difficulty, I should have to sit mumchance, and play a silent part, unless something in my own particular line started up; and that would be once in a blue moon. Now taking a back seat in anything in which I am engaged would not suit me; I am accustomed to be master, and master I intend to continue to be. If I were a good speaker the matter would be different; I could carry all before me, though I am ignorant of Greek and Latin. When I was a lad I did not have what you call ambition; I took a pride in making sensible contracts which would bring me in a profit, and I crept along steadily, never dreaming that I should ever reach my present position. But the case is altered now, and I have a real ambition--not directly for myself, but for you. I have no expectation that you will disappoint me.\"\n\n\"I will endeavor not to do so, father.\"\n\n\"That is a good lad. You will be one of the richest men in the country, but I want you to be something more; I want you to be one of the most influential. I want people to say as I walk along; 'There goes the father of the prime-minister.'\"\n\n\"That is looking a long way ahead,\" said Kingsley, considerably startled by this flight.\n\n\"Not a bit too far; it can be worked up to, and with your gifts it shall be. I have already told you that it matters little to me whether you are a Conservative, or a Liberal, or a Radical; that is your affair. If you are prime-minister and a Radical it will show that Radicalism is popular. I stop short of Socialism, mind you.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"Good. There is nothing nowadays that a man with a good education and a long purse cannot accomplish. I have the long purse, but not the education. I can talk sensibly enough to you here in a room, and in fairly good English, thanks to your mother and to my perseverance, but put me in the House of Commons and ask me to make a long speech upon large matters of state, and I should make a fool of myself. Therefore it is impossible I could ever become prime-minister.\"\n\n\"It is not every man who would speak so plainly and disparagingly of himself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but I happen to know the length of my tether; I happen to know what I am fitted for and what I am not. I don't want you to suppose that I am making a sacrifice; nothing of the kind. I keep my place; you work up to yours; then I shall be perfectly satisfied. I have had this in my mind for years, and instead of making you a contractor I have made you a gentleman. That is what other fathers have done, whose beginnings have been as humble as mine. New families are springing up, my boy, to take the place of the old; you, Kingsley, shall found a family which shall become illustrious, and I shall be content to look on and say: 'This is my doing; this is my work.' We shall show these old lords what new blood can do.\"\n\n\"Why, father,\" said Kingsley, laughing despite the uneasy feeling that was creeping over him, \"you are a Radical.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am, but we will keep it to ourselves. Now, Kingsley, it is my method when I am going in for a big contract to master beforehand everything in connection with it. I study it again and again; I verify my figures and calculations a dozen times before I set my name to it. That is what I have done in this affair. I have mastered the whole of the details, and I know exactly what is necessary. The first thing to make sure of when a great house is to be built, a house that is to last through sunshine and storm, a house that is to stand for centuries, is the foundation. That is out of sight, but it must be firm, and strong, and substantial. I am the foundation of this house I wish to build, and I am out of sight. Good. What is fine and beautiful to the eye you will supply--that is, you and your connections, in which, for convenience, we will say your mother and I do not count.\"\n\n\"My connections!\" exclaimed Kingsley. \"Apart from you and my mother!\"\n\n\"Quite so. There are families of the highest rank who would not shrink from admitting you, upon the closest terms, into their circle. Some are tottering, and fear the fall. Old estates are mortgaged up to their value, and every year makes their position worse. We, with our full purses, step in and set them right, and bury the ghosts which haunt them. There is nothing low and common about you, my boy. You are, in appearance, manners, and education, as good as the best of them, and lady mothers will only be too glad to welcome you. The first thing you must do is to marry.\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"And to marry well. I have authority for saying that you can marry the daughter of a duchess. I don't wonder that you look startled. I have seen the young lady; she is nineteen years of age, and very beautiful. Of course she knows nothing of the scheme. It is for you to win her--of which I have no fears. You can make settlements upon her, Kingsley, which would satisfy the most exacting of duchesses. The family has influence, great influence, socially and politically. Married to her, with your talents, your future is assured, if you have only a fair amount of industry. I have set my heart upon it, Kingsley.\"\n\n\"There is the question of love, father,\" said Kingsley, in a low tone. It seemed to him that his father had cut the ground from under his feet.\n\n\"Quite so. There is the question of love. You will win your way to her heart, without a doubt.\"\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nThere occurred here a pause. Kingsley did not know what to say. His father was waiting for him to speak.\n\n\"No man should think of marrying,\" said Kingsley, presently, \"unless there is love on both sides.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion to discuss that point,\" said Mr. Manners. \"As you will win your way to the young lady's heart, so will she win her way to yours. Wait till you see her, and meanwhile give me your promise that you will do your best to further my wishes. I do not expect a blind compliance; you shall go to her with your eyes open, and if you do not say she is very beautiful you must be a poor judge of beauty.\"\n\n\"But,\" murmured Kingsley, \"to have an affair like this cut and dried beforehand for the man who is most deeply concerned--well, father, there is something sordid and mercenary in it.\"\n\n\"There might be,\" said Mr. Manners, calmly, \"if the young lady knew anything of it; but she knows nothing.\"\n\n\"Yet you said you spoke with authority.\"\n\n\"Quite so. The young lady's mother has been indirectly sounded, and I spoke the truth. Listen, Kingsley,\" and Mr. Manners's more serious tone increased Kingsley's discomfort. \"I said I have set my heart upon the projects I have unfolded concerning your future. I have set something more than my heart upon them--I have set all my hopes upon them. You are my only child, and will be my heir if everything is right between us. You will come into an enormous fortune, greater than you have any idea of, and by its means and a suitable marriage you will rise to power. There are few men who would not jump at the proposition I have made, which, plainly explained, means your coming into everything that can make life desirable. If I were asking you to marry a lady who was ugly or had some deformity I could understand your hesitation. Do you still refuse to give me the promise I ask?\"\n\n\"I cannot give it to you, father.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Mr. Manners, in a stern voice; but he did not give Kingsley time to reply. \"Listen further to me before you speak.\" He took a pocket-book from his pocket, and drew from it a paper which he consulted. \"I can make excuses for slight faults of conduct, but will not pardon an opposition which threatens to destroy the most earnest wish of my life. You are acquainted with a person of the name of Loveday.\"\n\n\"I have the honor of his acquaintance,\" said Kingsley, nerving himself for the contest which he saw impending, and considerably surprised at his father's acquaintance with the name.\n\n\"He is a person of no character,\" said Mr. Manners.\n\n\"He is a gentleman,\" interrupted Kingsley.\n\n\"That is news to me,\" said Mr. Manners, \"and is not in accordance with the information I have received.\"\n\n\"Have you been playing the spy upon me?\" asked Kingsley, with some warmth.\n\n\"I should require to be in two places at once to have done that. This time last week I was in Russia.\"\n\n\"Then you have been paying some one to watch me. By what right, father?\"\n\n\"You jump too hastily at conclusions. You make a statement which is not true, and you proceed to question me upon it.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; but you must have obtained your information from some source.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me from whom?\n\n\"I may or I may not before we part to-night. You refused to give me a promise; I refuse to give you one. I might well take offence at the imputation that I have paid a spy to watch you.\"\n\n\"I withdrew the imputation, father.\"\n\n\"The suspicion was in itself an offence. I have allowed you to go your way, Kingsley, in the belief and hope that your way and mine were one, and that you would do nothing to disgrace me.\"\n\n\"I have done nothing to disgrace you.\"\n\n\"We may take different views. As a young man you have had what is called your 'fling.' I made you a most liberal allowance--\"\n\n\"For which I have always been deeply grateful, father,\" said Kingsley, hoping to turn the current of his father's wrath. It smote him with keen apprehension, for Nansie's sake and his own, that the anger his father displayed when he first mentioned the name of Loveday should be no longer apparent, and that Mr. Manners spoke in his usual calm and masterful voice.\n\n\"I made you a most liberal allowance,\" repeated Mr. Manners, \"which you freely spent. I did not demur to that; it pleased me that you should be liberal and extravagant, and prove yourself the equal in fortune, as you are in education and manners, of those with whom you mixed. You committed some follies, which I overlooked--and paid for.\"\n\n\"It is the truth, father. I got into debt and you cleared me.\"\n\n\"Did I reproach you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"If I am not mistaken--and in figures I seldom am--I paid your debts for you on three occasions.\"\n\n\"It is true, sir.\"\n\n\"And always cheerfully.\"\n\n\"Always, sir.\"\n\n\"I am not wishful to take undue credit to myself by reminding you of this; it is only that I would have you bear in mind that I have endeavored to make your life easy and pleasurable, and to do my duty by you. Nor will I make any comparison between your career as a young man and mine at the same age. I am satisfied, and I suppose you are the same.\"\n\n\"I think, father,\" said Kingsley, \"that I should have been content to work as you did.\"\n\n\"Not as I did, because we started from different standpoints. Pounds, shillings, and pence were of great importance to me, and I used to count them very jealously. I value money now perhaps as little as you do, but I know its value better than you, and what it can buy in a large way--in the way I have already explained to you. For that reason, and for no other, it is precious to me. There are men who have risen to wealth by discreditable means; that is not my case; what I possess has been fairly worked for and fairly earned. All through my life I have acted honorably and straightforwardly.\"\n\n\"All through my life, father,\" said Kingsley, with spirit, \"I shall do the same.\"\n\n\"Well and good. I have a special reason, Kingsley, in speaking of myself in the way I have done.\"\n\n\"Will you favor me with your reason, father?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is to put a strong emphasis upon what you will lose if you cut yourself away from me.\"\n\n\"Is there any fear of that, father?\" asked Kingsley, with a sinking heart.\n\n\"It will be for you, not for me, to answer that question; and it will be answered, I presume, more in acts than in words. I return to the Mr. Loveday, who is described to me as a person of no character, and whom you describe as a gentleman.\"\n\n\"He is one, father, believe me,\" said Kingsley, earnestly.\n\n\"Do gentlemen travel about the country in caravans, sleeping in them by the roadsides?\"\n\nKingsley could not help smiling. \"Not generally, father, but some men are whimsical.\"\n\n\"Let us keep to the point, Kingsley. According to your account we are speaking of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"We are,\" said Kingsley, somewhat nettled at this pinning down.\n\n\"Then you mean that some gentlemen are whimsical?\"\n\n\"I mean that.\"\n\n\"In what respect is this Mr. Loveday a gentleman? Does he come of an old family?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of his family?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Is he a man of means?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A poor man, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very poor?\"\n\n\"Very poor.\"\n\n\"And travels about in a broken-down caravan, and you wish me to believe he is a gentleman. I would prefer to take your word, Kingsley, against that of my informant, but in this instance I cannot do so. It would be stretching the limits too far.\"\n\n\"We will not argue it out, father.\"\n\n\"Very well. But Mr. Loveday does not travel alone in this caravan; he has a person he calls his daughter with him.\"\n\n\"It is coming,\" thought Kingsley, and he set his teeth fast, and said': \"His daughter, a lady, travels with him.\"\n\n\"So far, then, my facts are indisputable. This young woman is described to me as an artful, designing person who has used all her arts to entangle you--because you have a rich father.\"\n\n\"Who dares say that?\" cried Kingsley, starting up with flashing eyes.\n\n\"My informant. I understand, also, that some months since she contracted secretly a disreputable marriage, and that her husband--do not interrupt me for a moment, Kingsley--has conveniently disappeared in order to give her time to bleed you, through your rich father. To go through the ceremony again would be a light matter with her.\"\n\n\"It is a horrible calumny,\" cried Kingsley, in great excitement.\n\n\"Although,\" pursued Mr. Manners, exhibiting no agitation in his voice or manner, \"the circumstances of my own private life have not made me personally familiar with the tricks of adventuresses, I have in the course of my experiences learned sufficient of them to make me abhor them. How much deeper must be my abhorrence now when such a woman steps in between me and my son to destroy a cherished design which can only be carried out in his person! I will listen to no vindication, Kingsley. Before you arrived home to-night I had a strong hope that some mistake had been made in the information which has reached me concerning your proceedings. I was wrong; it is unhappily too true.\"\n\n\"You received the information from an enemy of mine.\"\n\n\"No, Kingsley, from a friend.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" There was here, even in the utterance of the simple word, a singular resemblance between father and son. Kingsley's voice no longer betrayed excitement, and his manner became outwardly calm. \"There is only one so-called friend who could have supplied you with the information--my cousin, Mark Inglefield.\"\n\nMr. Manners was silent.\n\n\"Was it he, sir?\" asked Kingsley.\n\nStill Mr. Manners was silent.\n\n\"I judge from your silence, sir, that Mark Inglefield is the man I have to thank.\"\n\nDuring his silence Mr. Manners had been considering.\n\n\"I must say something here, Kingsley. I have no right to betray another man's confidence, and you no right to betray mine.\"\n\n\"It would be the last of my wishes, father.\"\n\n\"If I tell you who is my informant, will you hold it as a sacred confidence?\"\n\nIt was Kingsley's turn now to consider. He was convinced that Mark Inglefield was his enemy, and by giving his father the desired promise of a sacred confidence, he would be shutting himself off from all chance of reprisal. On the other hand, he might be mistaken; and his father might also refuse to continue the interview, which Kingsley felt could not be broken at this point; and after all, how could he hope to help himself or Nansie by a personal encounter with his cousin or by further angering his father, who, he knew only too well, was now in a dangerous mood?\n\n\"Do you insist upon my holding it as a sacred confidence, father?\"\n\n\"I insist upon it,\" said Mr. Manners, coldly.\n\n\"I will hold it so.\"\n\n\"On your honor as a man? Not as a gentleman, for our views differ there.\"\n\n\"On my honor as a man.\"\n\n\"You were right,\" said Mr. Manners. \"I received the information from your cousin, Mark Inglefield.\"\n\n\"As I expected. I must now relate to you, father, the circumstances of my acquaintance with Mr. Loveday and his daughter, and the manner in which my cousin Mark comes into connection with it.\"\n\n\"I will listen to you, Kingsley,\" said Mr. Manners. \"Our conversation has assumed a complexion which may be productive of the most serious results to you and myself. I do not hold this out as a threat; I state a fact. I am, in my convictions, inflexible. Once I am resolved, no power on earth can move me. And do not lose sight of another thing. Mark Inglefield is your mother's nephew, and therefore your cousin. That I have given him the advantage of a university education, and that I sent you both to college at the same time, is my affair. I should have done the same by you had you been my nephew and he my son. It was always my intention to advance him in life, and it is my intention still. He is worthy of it. He is your equal in birth and attainments. Therefore speak of him with becoming respect. I shall know the exact value to place upon intemperate language in a case like this, where the passions are involved.\"\n\n\"I will do my best to obey you, father,\" said Kingsley, \"but a pure reputation is at stake, and I may fail in my endeavor. It was my cousin, Mark Inglefield, who first introduced me to Miss Loveday. He spoke to me of her, as he spoke to others, in a light tone, and I do not know what it was that induced me to give ear to his boastings, although I entertained a contempt for him and a doubt of his truth. One day, while we were walking together and he was indulging with greater freedom and boisterousness than usual--though his ordinary habit was bad enough--of his acquaintanceship with Miss Loveday, it happened that we met her. He could do no less than introduce me, and I had not been in her company five minutes before I suspected that his vaporings about her were those of a base man, of one who was dead to honor. A true man is respectful and modest when he makes reference to a lady for whom he entertains an affection, and the doubts I had previously entertained of my cousin when he indulged in the outpourings of his coarse vanity were now confirmed. I followed up the introduction by courting Miss Loveday's intimacy, and she grew to respect me, to rely upon me. The more I saw of her the more I esteemed her. Never had I met a lady so pure and gentle, and it was a proud moment in my life when she asked me to protect her from my cousin's insolent advances. I spoke to him, in a manner not too gentle, I own, for my indignation was aroused, and from that time he and I were enemies. I know it now; I did not know it then. He was far too subtle for me, and I, perhaps too much in the habit of wearing my heart upon my sleeve, was, as I now discover, sadly at a disadvantage with him. He showed no anger at my supplanting him, and this should have warned me; your cold-blooded man is a dangerous animal when he becomes your enemy; but I suppose I was too deeply in love and too happy to harbor suspicion against one who had no real cause for enmity against me. Nor did I consider the consequences--not to myself but to the lady I loved--of my frequent visits and meetings with her. There is no doubt that she was compromised by them, but she was as guileless and innocent as myself, and it was not till it was forced upon me that her reputation was in my hands that I prevailed upon her to take the step which gave the lie to malicious rumor.\"\n\n\"And that step, Kingsley?\" asked Mr. Manners.\n\n\"I married her. She is my wife.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Think so, father! What do you mean? Am I a man with reason, gifted with some standard of intelligence, that I should think--which implies a doubt--where I am sure?\"\n\n\"You are a man deluded, Kingsley, as other men have been by other women. This woman has deceived you.\"\n\n\"No, sir, truly as I live.\"\n\n\"The farce would not be complete unless you protested. It is the least you can do. All that you have said confirms your cousin's story. He has not erred in one particular, except in what is excusable in him, and perhaps in you. Mischief is done, but it can be remedied. An impulsive man like yourself is no match for an artful woman.\"\n\n\"I will not hear the lady I love and esteem so spoken of,\" said Kingsley, with warmth.\n\nTo this remark Mr. Manners was about to reply with equal warmth, but he checked himself, and did not speak for a few moments. When he resumed the conversation he spoke in his usual calm tone, a tone which never failed in impressing upon his hearers a conviction of the speaker's absolute sincerity and indomitable will.\n\n\"It has happened--fortunately for others--but rarely in my life, Kingsley, that such a crisis as this has occurred; and I regret this difference in our ideas all the more because its consequences may be fatal to you and may shatter hopes upon which I have set great store. When you say to me that you will not hear me speak in such or such a manner, because it displeases you, you behave in a manner to which I am not accustomed. When you place yourself in opposition to my wishes you treat me to a new experience which I do not welcome. Were I holding this interview with any other than yourself I should have put an end to it some time since; after that there would be nothing more to be said on either side. I am not used to disappointments, but I should be able to bear them; I am rather fond of difficulties because it is a pleasure to overcome them. I am inclined to regard this difference of opinion between us as a difficulty which may be overcome without much trouble, if you are reasonable.\"\n\n\"It is not a difference of opinion, father,\" said Kingsley, moderating his tone; the interests at stake were too serious to allow him to give his indignation free play, \"it is a difference as to facts, of which I, and not you, am cognizant.\"\n\n\"I hold to what I say, Kingsley,\" replied Mr. Manners. \"I have received a certain statement of particulars which I choose to accept as true; you have imparted to me certain information which I do not choose to accept in the manner you wish. Setting aside for a moment all question of the young woman of whose character we have formed different estimates, I ask you, supposing you to be legally married, what is the kind of respect you have shown me, a father who has never crossed your wishes, by contracting a lifelong obligation without consulting me?\"\n\n\"It was wrong, father,\" said Kingsley, with contrition. \"I have only the excuse to make that I loved her and was eager to defend her reputation.\"\n\n\"It is an excuse I cannot accept. And the deliberate committal of a fault so fatally grave as this, with a full knowledge of the consequences, cannot be condoned by the weak confession, when it is too late to repair the fault, that you were wrong. There is a repentance which comes too late, Kingsley. But even that I might have forgiven had I reason to approve of your choice.\"\n\n\"You have but to see her, father,\" said Kingsley, eagerly. \"Let me bring her to you! You will be as proud of her as I am; you will know then that I have not chosen unworthily.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Manners, \"if I see her at all I must see her alone.\"\n\n\"Give me a minute or two to consider, father.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Kingsley.\"\n\nThe young man turned aside, and allowed his thoughts to travel to Nansie, and to dwell upon the beauty of her character. He knew her to be patient and long-suffering, and that she would not shrink from making a sacrifice for one she loved as she loved him; he knew also that these qualities were allied to a spirit of independence which, while it would enable her to bear up outwardly under the pressure of a great wrong, would rather intensify than abate the anguish which would wring her soul were such a wrong forced upon her. It would be a lifelong anguish, and would rack her till her dying day. His father, with his iron will, was just the man to force the sacrifice upon her, was just the man to so prevail upon her that she might, at his persuasion, remove herself forever not only from the presence but from the knowledge of the man she loved and had vowed to love while life remained. Poor, helpless, dependent, and alone in the world--for Kingsley had an inward conviction that her father's days were numbered--to what a future would he, the man who had sworn to love and cherish her, be condemning her if he permitted his father to have his way in this matter! The crime would be his, not his father's; upon his soul would rest the sin. And then the image of Nansie rose before him, not at first sad and despondent, but bright and sweet, and full of innocent, joyous life; and in that image he saw a sunshine of happiness which he and Nansie would enjoy together if he played a true man's part in this contention. He saw also with his mind's eye the other side of the picture in the figure of a heart-broken woman brooding over the misery and the torture of life, and praying for death. This sad figure vanished, and he and Nansie were sitting together hand in hand, their hearts beating with the sacred love which sweetens and makes life holy, and she was whispering to him that her greatest joy lay in the knowledge that he was true to her.\n\nHe had shaded his eyes with his hand during this contemplation. He now removed it, and raised his eyes to his father's face.\n\n\"I cannot consent, father,\" he said, in a low, firm tone, \"to your seeing her alone.\"\n\n\"You have come deliberately to that determination?\" asked Mr. Manners.\n\n\"I have, father.\"\n\n\"It is irrevocable?\"\n\n\"It is irrevocable.\"\n\n\"I will still not hold you to it,\" said Mr. Manners. \"It would grieve me in the future to think that the matter was too hastily decided. You owe me some kind of obedience, some kind of duty.\"\n\n\"I acknowledge it, father. In all that becomes me to yield you shall have no cause of complaint against me.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let there be some slight pause before the final word is pronounced. Remain here a week, and give the matter a calmer and longer deliberation. Its issues are sufficiently important to make my request reasonable.\"\n\n\"I will do as you wish, father,\" said Kingsley, after a slight hesitation, \"on two conditions.\"\n\n\"Name them.\"\n\n\"First, that you do not invite my cousin, Mark Inglefield, here during the time.\"\n\n\"I agree.\"\n\n\"Second, that you do not seek my wife for the purpose of relating what has passed between us.\"\n\n\"I agree to that also. I will not seek your--the young woman for that or for any purpose. Are you content, Kingsley?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I am content.\"\n\n\"As you admit that you owe me some small measure of duty and obedience, you will not object to my request that you hold no correspondence with her until the week is past.\"\n\n\"It is a hard request, father, but I will obey you.\"\n\n\"There remains, then, in this connection, but one thing in respect of your future which I think it necessary to impress upon you. As I have made my fortune by my own efforts it is mine to dispose of as I please. Comply with my wishes, and the bulk of it is yours. Oppose them, and not one shilling of it will be yours to enjoy. To this I pledge myself. And now, Kingsley, we will drop the conversation.\"\n\nKingsley had a reason for consenting to the week's delay. He had a hope that within that period his father would relent. It was a faint hope, but it seemed to him that it would be criminal to let it slip.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nOn the fourth day of his probation Kingsley received a letter from Nansie. No further words upon the subject of their recent conversation had passed between him and his father; neither of them had broken faith in respect of the promises given, and everything went on in the house as usual. Mr. Manners passed the greater portion of his time in looking over specifications and making calculations for fresh contracts of magnitude; he was accustomed to attend personally to these matters, and never left anything to chance, or solely in the hands of any other man. It was not without an object that he requested Kingsley to assist him in his labors during these days. He wished his son to become sensible of what he would lose if he persisted in his opposition to his father's wishes. With this end in view he made Kingsley familiar with all the channels in which his fortune was invested. Kingsley was amazed at its extent, and was also amazed at the wisdom of his father's investments. There were no chance risks; every shilling was as safe as human judgment could make it. He owned a great deal of property in land upon which other men had built houses, and the land was situated in the most thriving and most fashionable neighborhoods; he held a vast number of government securities, and those only of the most stable governments. Companies he had avoided, their alluring prospectuses having no temptation for him. He had advanced scores of thousands of pounds upon first mortgages, and not a doubtful one among them.\n\n\"I was never a gambler,\" he said to Kingsley, \"but I never let my money lie idle. I have the offer now of a great estate in the country, which, if all goes well, I shall buy. It is in one of the best counties, and the simple possession of it will give a man a standing in the country which would occupy all the years of a man's life to gain. A stroke of the pen will do it.\"\n\nKingsley knew what he meant when he said \"if all goes well,\" but each kept the open expression of his thoughts to himself. On the evening before Nansie's letter arrived, Mr. Manners told Kingsley that his income was not less than sixty thousand pounds a year; and he added that he was not spending a tenth part of it.\n\nIn the solitude of his chamber Kingsley opened Nansie's letter; it had been written from day to day, only for her lover's and husband's eyes:\n\nDeeply shocked and grieved, Kingsley went to his father with Nansie's letter in his hand. \"I want you to release me from my promise,\" he said.\n\n\"I never release a man from a promise given,\" was his father's cold reply, \"and I never ask to be released from one I have made.\"\n\n\"You cannot refuse me,\" said Kingsley, whose eyes were bedewed with tears.\n\n\"I do refuse you,\" said Mr. Manners, sternly.\n\nKingsley gazed irresolutely around, but his irresolution lasted for a moment or two only. \"I must go,\" he said, straightening himself.\n\n\"Against my will?\" asked Mr. Manners.\n\n\"Yes, father, against your will, if you refuse.\"\n\n\"I have refused.\"\n\nKingsley was silent.\n\n\"It is what I will never forgive,\" said Mr. Manners.\n\n\"I cannot help it, father. There are duties which must be performed, and one is before me.\" He held out the last page of Nansie's letter, but his father thrust it aside.\n\n\"I do not wish to see it. I will not see it. It is from that woman.\"\n\n\"It is from my wife.\"\n\n\"And you are going to her?\"\n\n\"I am going to her.\"\n\n\"If you leave my house now you never enter its doors again. If you persist in your madness I cut you out of my heart forever. I shall have no longer a son, and for evermore you and I are strangers.\"\n\n\"It is cruel--it is pitiful, but I must go.\"\n\n\"You understand the consequences of your disobedience?\"\n\n\"You have made them only too plain to me, father,\" said Kingsley, mournfully.\n\n\"And you still persist?\"\n\n\"There is no other course open to me. I am a man, not a dog.\"\n\n\"You are an ingrate. Go!--and never let me look upon your face again. From this moment I do not know you.\"\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nThere are extant numerous clippings from famous writers which, coming \"trippingly off the tongue,\" have grown into popular favor and are generally accepted as the essence of wisdom, but which will not stand the test of cold and logical analysis. Hence it is that so many familiar proverbs belie themselves. Among these popular sayings may be classed the description of life as a fitful fever. There are few men and women to whom this will apply; with the great majority of human beings life glides from one groove into another with ease and naturalness, and the most startling changes are effected without violent strain. Poor men grow rich, rich men grow poor, the lowly mount, the high slip into the downward paths, and one and all accept the reversals of position with a certain innate philosophy which makes life desirable, and often sweet, however wide the gulf which separates the present from the past. It is something to be genuinely grateful for; were it otherwise, existence would become an intolerable burden, and every waking moment would be charged with pain.\n\nThese obs"
