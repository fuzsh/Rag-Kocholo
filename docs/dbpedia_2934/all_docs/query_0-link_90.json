        "text": "Michael Jackson - The Spiritual Teacher\n\nMichael Jackson's stage presence was undoubtedly incomparable. He performed with an energy and a divine ambiance that was clearly not of this world. No one else in our lifetime, will ever come close to the magnanimous and influential powerhouse that was...Michael Jackson. But I now ponder, were we just too enamored with the performer and his image, to realize the profoundness of the spiritual and life lessons he was teaching us all along - contained in the lyrics of his songs?\n\nMichael Jackson's passion, purpose and message was for peace, harmony, and equality in the world. He longed for simple experiences that we, today, continue to take for granted. He wanted normality. He wanted to be accepted as he was. Most importantly, he wanted to experience a childhood. Was his behavior as a \"childlike man\" a bit strange for some? Yes....Maybe. However, if you have never experienced NOT having a childhood, you have no grounds for judgment. According to the Bible Scriptures - Luke 18: 16-17 states \"I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.\"\n\nHe said in an interview once, \"If you really want to know about me, listen to the lyrics in my song - Have You Seen My Childhood.\" The Lyrics are as follow: \"Have You Seen My Childhood? I'm searching for the world that I come from. Cause I've been looking around, in the lost and found of my heart. No one understands me, They view it as such strange eccentricities...Cause I keep kidding around. Like a child, but pardon me...People say I'm not okay, Cause I love such elementary things...It's been my fate to compensate, for the Childhood I've never known...Before you judge me, try hard to love me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson suffered greatly internally. The only place he felt free was on stage. When he performed he was \"being\" and in alignment with his divine purpose. He knew he wasn't being judged by his fans...we loved and still love him. He utilized his God-given talents and abilities with every fiber and cell in his body. He poured his heart and soul into each performance, with fans at every corner and stretch of the world receiving him. Michael Jackson sincerely loved us. He suffered even more at the condemnation and crude perceptions of those who have no conscience. Those individuals who use such cowardly covers stating: \"I'm Just A Reporter Reporting The News,\" or \"I Just Want To Sell My Tabloids.\" These vicious people sought fame and fortune, out of their own envious ways, destroying those to whom the stories are written about. They are so blinded by having the \"exclusive story\" that they are not stopping to even think about the detrimental effects of their actions. Over the years, they devastatingly touched the soul of one of God's Angels. This, along with his personal issues, had kept Michael Jackson in constant emotional pain, mental pain and lifelong turmoil for most of his life.\n\nLyrics from his song \"Tabloid Junkie\" can best describe how he felt: \"Speculate to break the one you hate. Circulate the lie you confiscate. Assassinate and mutilate. As the hounding media in hysteria, Who's the next for you to resurrect...It's slander. With the words you use. You're a parasite in black and white. Do anything for news. And you don't go and buy it. To read it sanctifies it.\"\n\nMichael Jackson did not allow the public scrutiny to keep him from entertaining his fans. He remained persistent in his message and mission of bringing love unto the world, with such lyrics from his song \"Another Part of Me\" - \"We're sending out, A major love, And this is our message to you. The planets are lining up, We're bringing brighter days. They're all in line, Waiting for you. Can't you see.....You're just Another Part of Me.\"\n\nWe are all a part of each other. When you tear one down, we all suffer. Including those who are responsible for the act itself; they just don't know it yet. When one is in turmoil, we all are. When one is crying out for help, we need to answer. Michael Jackson cried and cried and cried. Not with tears streaming down his face; but rather with all the ways he changed the look of his appearance. The way we truly feel on the inside, will definitely reflect those same feelings on the outside. I think that because his childhood was so tumultuous, he maybe set out to take away any signs of how he looked. As this would be a permanent constant reminder. The public also contributed with negative reports of his prominent \"African American\" features and so on and so forth. What he didn't understand, I believe, was that his fans never complained. We loved Michael Jackson just as he was. I think he expected that changing his appearance on the outside, would also create new emotional and mental feelings for him on the inside. If you haven't learned anything from the Spiritual Teachings of the Divine Spirit that was and is Michael Jackson.....let's remember this Scripture from Matthew 7:2 - \"Others will treat you as you treat them. Whatever measure you use in judging others, it will be used to measure how you are judged.\"\n\nMichael Jackson has served his purpose, has carried out his mission, and has delivered his message. He has entered the gates of heaven where he's entertaining God and his fellow Angels. Now he can finally rest in the comfort and peace of his true father's arms, as he now knows and feels acceptance. He can now be that \"child\" without judgment. And most of all....he has heard those approving words from his true father in heaven....\"My Child.....Yours Is Indeed A Job Well Done!\"\n\nIn Conclusion.......Lyrics To Michael Jackson's Song: \"Gone Too Soon.\"\n\nLike A Comet, Blazing Cross The Evening Sky...Gone Too Soon.\n\nLike A Rainbow, Fading In The Twinkling of an Eye......Gone Too Soon.\n\nShiny and Sparkly, and Splendidly Bright.\n\nHere One Day.....Gone One Night.\n\nLike A Castle, Built Upon A Sandy Beach......Gone Too Soon.\n\nLike A Perfect Flower, That Is Beyond Your Reach...Gone Too Soon.\n\nBorn To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight\n\nHere One Day....Gone One Night.\n\nLike A Sunset, Dying With The Rising of The Moon\n\nGone Too Soon.\n\nGone Too Soon.\n\n(Source: Dr. Monica Burns-Capers, Ph.D )\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://mj.vivomi.com/news-mj-the-spiritual-teacher.php\n\nMichael Jackson is the most Astonishing Person I have ever met on the face of this planet\n\n“Michael Jackson is the most astonishing person I have ever met on the face of this planet. I never expected to meet anybody like him; I never suspected there was anybody like him. He lived to give. He lived to give to his audience. He loved his audience.\n\nOne day I got a call at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, here in New York saying, “You gotta be out here - meaning L.A. - tonight at 11 o’clock. Michael is cancelling his tour and you’re the only one he’ll listen to.” Michael and I sat down in a trailer that night at 11 o’clock - a dark trailer outside in studio lot in L.A. where he and his brothers were rehearsing for their tour. It was like two prophets going up against each other. Michael said to me, “I will not go out on stage. I owe my audience. I owe them the most astonishing thing they have ever seen in their life. My brother Jackie is the best dancer I have ever seen. And my brother Jackie has just came down with a bone chip in his knee. If I can’t go out with the best dancer in the world, then I will not go out, because I will not cheat my audience.” And I felt as if Michael’s chest, the ribs had opened like gates, and I could see 10 000 kids inside of there. And Michael would not let anybody screw around with those kids. He owed them something tremendous. And I had to convince him on the reason, that cancelling his tour would screw those kids. Because they would cease to believe in him, his tour would be so badly… his tour had already been savaged by the press over and over again. His public would not believe in him anymore. And he could feel his audience in my chest. I never expected to meet a human being like that.\n\nOne day we were looking at pictures together for what was supposed to be his next album cover, and his knees buckled when he saw only one inch of a picture in a portfolio, and he made an orgasmic sound. And the further he unpeeled back the page, the more his knees buckled. I knew, I was standing next to him. I could feel his body language. And the more - the orgasmic sounds grew, because Michael was capable of seeing the infinity in the tiniest of things, and I never ever in my life expected to meet that quality of wonder and that kind of extreme generosity. He lived for other people. And when he couldn’t live for other people, he died a little. If there ever was a saint on the face of this planet, Michael was it.”\n\n— Howard Bloom, MJ’s manager during the Victory tour\n\nSource:\n\nRemembering Michael Jackson: The Story Behind His Magnum Opus\n\nBefore Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, before Avatar and Wall-E, before \"going green\" became a catchphrase, came Michael Jackson's \"Earth Song,\" one of the most unusual, audacious protest songs in popular music history. A massive hit globally (reaching #1 in over fifteen countries), it wasn't even released as a single in the United States.\n\nYet nearly sixteen years later, its admirers continue to grow. The song's desperate plea on behalf of the planet and its inhabitants (particularly the most vulnerable) remains as relevant and important as ever.\n\n\"Earth Song\" mattered deeply to Jackson, who rightfully considered it one of his greatest artistic achievements. He planned for it to be the climax of his ill-fated This Is It concert series in London. It was the last song he rehearsed before he died.\n\nThe following excerpt is from a 50-page piece entitled \"Earth Song: Inside Michael Jackson's Magnum Opus,\" which details the song's evolution from its inception in Vienna to Jackson's final live performance in Munich:\n\n\"Michael Jackson was alone in his hotel room, pacing.\n\nHe was in the midst of the second leg of his Bad World Tour, an exhausting, 123-concert spectacular that stretched over nearly two years. The tour would become the largest-grossing and most-attended concert series in history.\n\nJust days earlier, Jackson had performed in Rome at Flaminio Stadium to an ecstatic sold-out crowd of over 30,000. In his downtime, he visited the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Cathedral at the Vatican with Quincy Jones and legendary composer, Leonard Bernstein. Later, they drove to Florence where Jackson stood beneath Michelangelo's masterful sculpture, David, gazing up in awe.\n\nNow he was in Vienna, Austria, music capital of the Western world. It was here where Mozart's brilliant Symphony No. 25 and haunting Requiem were composed; where Beethoven studied under Haydn and played his first symphony. And it was here, at the Vienna Marriott, on June 1, 1988, that Michael Jackson's magnum opus, \"Earth Song,\" was born.\n\nThe six-and-a-half-minute piece that materialized over the next seven years was unlike anything heard before in popular music. Social anthems and protest songs had long been part of the heritage of rock. But not like this. \"Earth Song\" was something more epic, dramatic, and primal. Its roots were deeper; its vision more panoramic. It was a lamentation torn from the pages of Job and Jeremiah, an apocalyptic prophecy that recalled the works of Blake, Yeats, and Eliot.\n\nIt conveyed musically what Picasso's masterful aesthetic protest, Guernica, conveyed in art. Inside its swirling scenes of destruction and suffering were voices -- crying, pleading, shouting to be heard (\"What about us?\").\n\n\"Earth Song\" would become the most successful environmental anthem ever recorded, topping the charts in over fifteen countries and selling over five million copies. Yet critics never quite knew what to make of it. Its unusual fusion of opera, rock, gospel, and blues sounded like nothing on the radio. It defied almost every expectation of a traditional anthem. In place of nationalism, it envisioned a world without division or hierarchy. In place of religious dogma or humanism, it yearned for a broader vision of ecological balance and harmony. In place of simplistic propaganda for a cause, it was a genuine artistic expression. In place of a jingly chorus that could be plastered on a T-shirt or billboard, it offered a wordless, universal cry.\n\nJackson remembered the exact moment the melody came.\n\nIt was his second night in Vienna. Outside his hotel, beyond Ring Strasse Boulevard and the sprawling Stadtpark, he could see the majestically lit museums, cathedrals, and opera houses. It was a world of culture and privilege far removed from his boyhood home in Gary, Indiana. Jackson was staying in spacious conjoining suites lined with large windows and a breathtaking view. Yet for all the surrounding opulence, mentally and emotionally he was somewhere else.\n\nIt wasn't mere loneliness (though he definitely felt that). It was something deeper -- an overwhelming despair about the condition of the world.\n\nPerhaps the most common trait associated with celebrity is narcissism. In 1988, Jackson certainly would have had reason to be self-absorbed. He was the most famous person on the planet. Everywhere he traveled, he created mass hysteria. The day after his sold-out concert at Prater Stadium in Vienna, an AP article ran, \"130 Fans Faint at Jackson Concert.\" If the Beatles were more popular than Jesus, as John Lennon once claimed, Jackson had the entire Holy Trinity beat.\n\nMichael Jackson performs in Vienna, Austria on June 2, 1988, one day after conceiving of \"Earth Song.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: Zoran Veselinovic\n\nWhile Jackson enjoyed the attention in certain ways, he also felt a profound responsibility to use his celebrity for more than fame and fortune (in 2000, The Guinness Book of World Records cited him as the most philanthropic pop star in history). \"When you have seen the things I have seen and traveled all over the world, you would not be honest to yourself and the world to [look away],\" Jackson explained.\n\nAt nearly every stop on his Bad World Tour, he would visit orphanages and hospitals. Just days earlier, while in Rome, he stopped by the Bambin Gesu Children's Hospital, handing out gifts, taking pictures, and signing autographs. Before leaving, he pledged a donation of over $100,000 dollars.\n\nWhile performing or helping children, he felt strong and happy, but when he returned to his hotel room, a combination of anxiety, sadness, and desperation sometimes seized him.\n\nJackson had always been sensitive to suffering and injustice. But in recent years, his feeling of moral responsibility grew. The stereotype of his naiveté ignored his natural curiosity and sponge-like mind. While he wasn't a policy wonk (Jackson unquestionably preferred the realm of art to politics), he also wasn't oblivious to the world around him. He read widely, watched films, talked to experts, and studied issues passionately. He was deeply invested in trying to understand and change the world.\n\nIn 1988, he certainly had reason for concern. The news read like chapters from ancient scripture: there were heat waves and droughts, massive wildfires and earthquakes, genocide and famine. Violence escalated in the Holy Land as forests were ravaged in the Amazon and garbage, oil and sewage swept up on shores. In place of Time's Person of the Year, 1988's cover story was dedicated to the \"endangered earth.\" It suddenly occurred to many that we were literally destroying our own home.\n\nMost people read or watch the news casually, passively. They become numb to the horrifying images and stories projected on the screen. Yet such stories frequently moved Jackson to tears. He internalized them and felt physical pain. When people told him to simply enjoy his own good fortune, he got angry. He believed completely in John Donne's philosophy that \"no man is an island.\" For Jackson, the idea extended to all life. The whole planet was connected and intrinsically valuable.\n\n\"[For the average person],\" he explained, \"he sees problems 'out there' to be solved... But I don't feel that way -- those problems aren't 'out there,' really. I feel them inside me. A child crying in Ethiopia, a seagull struggling pathetically in an oil spill... a teenage soldier trembling with terror when he hears the planes fly over: Aren't these happening in me when I see and hear about them?\"\n\nOnce, during a dance rehearsal, he had to stop because an image of a dolphin trapped in a net made him so emotionally distraught. \"From the way its body was tangled in the lines,\" he explained, \"you could read so much agony. Its eyes were vacant, yet there was still that smile, the ones dolphins never lose... So there I was, in the middle of rehearsal, and I thought, 'They're killing a dance.'\"\n\nWhen Jackson performed, he could feel these turbulent emotions surging through him. With his dancing and singing, he tried to transfuse the suffering, give it expression, meaning, and strength. It was liberating. For a brief moment, he could take his audience to an alternative world of harmony and ecstasy. But inevitably, he was thrown back into the \"real world\" of fear and alienation.\n\nSo much of this pain and despair circulated inside Jackson as he stood in his hotel room, brooding.\n\nThen suddenly it \"dropped in [his] lap\": Earth's song. A song from her perspective, her voice. A lamentation and a plea.\n\nThe chorus came to him first -- a wordless cry. He grabbed his tape player and pressed record. Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh.\n\nThe chords were simple, but powerful: A-flat minor to C-sharp triad; A-flat minor seventh to C-sharp triad; then modulating up, B-flat minor to E-flat triad. That's it! Jackson thought. He then worked out the introduction and some of the verses. He imagined its scope in his head. This, he determined, would be the greatest song he'd ever composed...\"\n\nCopyright © 2011 Joseph Vogel\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lw-bo7fCzhQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOne of Michael Jackson's most memorable performances of \"Earth Song\" (Brunei, 1996).\n\nThe full version of \"Earth Song: Inside Michael Jackson's Magnum Opus\" can be downloaded at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and the iBookstore (iTunes).\n\nFor more information, visit www.joevogel.net/earthsong.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-vogel/michael-jackson-earth-song_b_882740.html\n\nMichael Jackson: The Truth About his 'Final' Photoshoot\n\nThe image of Michael Jackson that graces the cover of Q magazine’s August 2009 issue, which coincidentally went to press shortly before Jackson’s tragic death, has been widely circulated as the last authorized photograph of the singer. While that remains likely to be true, photographer John Wright tells the Music Mix that the photo shoot in question actually took place several years ago, in approximately 2007. Guinness World Records hired Wright at the time to photograph Jackson at the company’s central London office, where the star was accepting an award for his history-making album sales. “I got a call, ‘Do you want to shoot Michael Jackson next week?’” Wright recalls. “I said, ‘Yeah, sure.’ I was extremely relaxed about it, because I was absolutely certain he would never show up. But about 2 p.m. in the afternoon, he walked in.”\n\nJackson was joined by “a fairly large entourage” including bodyguards, management, and a few lucky fans — but no makeup artist or stylist. “It was extremely underplayed,” says Wright. “The thing that excited me was it was an opportunity to do a really, really honest portrait of that face.” Jackson spent about an hour meeting and greeting Guinness officials before Wright got a three-minute window to shoot him. “What struck me was his shyness. He carried himself really quite humbly, I thought. I’ve shot a lot of celebrities, and was pleasantly taken with the fact that Michael Jackson went out of his way to introduce himself and shake hands with everybody on my crew, which was about four people on the day — even crossing the room to shake hands with one of my assistants, which was unnecessary, but he obviously felt compelled to out of a sense of grace and politeness.” Adds Wright, “I want to make it clear: He was attentive, he was focused, he was having fun. That wasn’t an ill man who was in the room with me.”\n\nAfter photographing Jackson for about 90 seconds in total, Wright had three usable head shots, one of which he eventually sold to Q earlier this year when the magazine put together its August 2009 cover story on the King of Pop’s planned London comeback concerts. Now, as it becomes clear that the Guinness shoot may have been Jackson’s last, Wright says he’s been approached by a number of outlets looking to print the other two photos. While he provided one to a German tribute publication, he’s proceeding with caution. “It really depends on the context of what they’re doing. It will always be the picture that it is, and it’s looking like it could be the last official portrait that was shot of him. I’ve got no need to exploit the situation.” (When contacted by EW, Jackson’s reps were unable to confirm at this time whether this was his final photo shoot.)\n\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FqmwBFPrih0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://music-mix.ew.com/2009/07/10/michael-jackson-photo-shoot/\n\nLove and Sacrifice\n\nHave you noticed lately how in all walks of life, all areas, the focus is shifting from FORM to ESSENCE. Many things are happening currently in our world, that ask us to rely less on our five primary senses and more on our heart, our inner knowledge and intuition. That is why people like Michael had such an important message for humanity, the message of love, light, and hope. This is a time to let go of the fears that grow like weeds in the gardens of our soul, and to water that tree, that lotus flower of our soul's garden, so love can really grow and reach out to all who are in such dire need of unconditional love\n\nUndoubtedly you will have heard the complete recording of Michael's voice, on May 10th 2009, although slurred, he never once wavered from his life's mission, his Divine purpose, to help the children of the world, to Heal the World. While the recording itself is sad and heartbreaking, if you focus on the essence, the purpose, his ideal, it becomes nothing short of amazing how Michael could keep his true life's focus even under the most trying of circumstances. He is willing to sacrifice everything, feeling their pain, as a true empath and the world's greatest humanitarian, to make the commitment for his life's dream: The Michael Jackson Children's Hospital. He was willing to do whatever it took to make his dream happen. It is my deepest wish that his vision of a Michael Jackson's Childrens Hospital will become a reality in his honor. I also hope and pray that the media will shift their focus to the essence of Michael Jackson: his message of Love and to Heal the World!\n\n~ MJJLaugh\n\nOur prime purpose in this life is to help others.

The world is made up of all of us; me and you, and our beloved planet, nature, the trees, the birds and the animals, the skies. How can you help heal the world ? Maybe you say to yourself: I'm just one person and don't make much money, what could I possibly do to help heal the world ?\n\nYou don't have to be rich, famous or a singer to help heal the world. When we talk to each other, at school or work, at home, online, on the phone, we hear noises: sounds of young voices, and old voices, high-pitched voices and deep voices, music in the mix, cars, airplanes, sirens, the washing machine, a dog barking, and maybe arguments, laughter, crying, children playing, dogs barking. Thinks of all the noises you hear each day. But are you really listening ? Listening to the other, with a open heart and open mind, with compassion, unites us as people. Everyone needs to be heard, but who is listening ?\n\nDo you want to be part of the cacaphony of noise, or do you want to be a note in the symphony of love ? Our great conductor of love's symphony was Michael, and if we do what we are supposed to do, at the precise moment we are meant to do it, the notes will blend together in heaven's wondrous melody, a healing sound for all of us and our planet.\n\nAll notes, great or small, play their own role in life's symphony, together creating a wondrous melody....\n\n~ MJJLaugh\n\n[YouTube]s7pGTkT-KaQ[/YouTube]\n\nLearning is a result of listening, which in turn leads to even better listening and attentiveness to the other person. In other words, to learn from the child, we must have empathy, and empathy grows as we learn.\n\n~ Alice Miller\n\nYou can practice deep listening in order to relieve the suffering in us, and in the other person. That kind of listening is described as compassionate listening. You listen only for the purpose of relieving suffering in the other person.\n\n~ Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nBeing heard is so close to being loved that for the average person they are almost indistinguishable.\n\n~ David Augsburger\n\nWhen we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely -- the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears -- when you give your whole attention to it.\n\n- Jiddu Krishnamurti\n\nSource for the quotes:\n\nhttp://www.wisdomquotes.com/topics/listening/\n\nSanta Maria man shares story behind Michael Jackson’s “The Broken Heart Stone”\n\nA twist of fate is the reason a Santa Maria man says he ended up with a unique piece of Michael Jackson memorabilia. It’s being called “The Broken Heart Stone” and there’s quite a story behind it. If you can believe this, it was actually lost for more than two decades before being found again.\n\nThe king of pop was at the top of his career with the Thriller album. In fact, Jackson won eight Grammys and his career seemed unstoppable. During that time, the pop star also created something special. Andrew Wilson, Jackson memorabilia owner, said, “I really believe it’s something the world should see.” It’s a 500 pound cement slab dated June 1984 and features a hand print, footprints and autograph of Jackson.\n\nWilson said, “I was at the right place, at the right time.” The former five time international Kung Fu champion and Santa Maria resident had formed a business relationship with Jackson. He said, “I was very supportive of him during the trial.” Wilson even wrote a letter of support for Jackson to a local newspaper. “I got word back from the people at Neverland that Michael had seen it and was very pleased about it,” said Wilson.\n\nWilson says that twist of fate came on the day Jackson died. He arrived in Las Vegas and ran into some of those same people. He said, “People at Neverland knew me and said oh my gosh, I think Michael would love for you to have this.” They put him in contact with the then-owner of the impression. Originally, it was made for the Walk of Fame project for the city of Las Vegas but that never materialized. So what’s shocking, the stone stayed hidden in the basement of the Riviera Hotel for more than two decades before being sold.\n\nWilson said, “You can actually look at his hand and you can actually see a heart print.” The left palm print features a heart shape design with a crack running through it, that’s how the name “The Broken Heart Stone” came about. “A broken heart represents not only Michael but the fans that loved him in his quick and immediate passing,” said Wilson. He goes on to say, “I think it’s kind of a statement to the world. Yeah, I died with a broken heart and I have fans who have a broken heart because of me.”\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://mjforeverlove.wordpress.com/...hind-michael-jacksons-the-broken-heart-stone/\n\nMichael and the Lionel Trains\n\nThis is an excerpt from Jermaine Jackson's book which I found on a website, thankfully, so I wouldn't have to type it over from the book. I can just imagine it all: a little black boy hoping with all his might to one day own a miniature Lionel train...\n\n“Go faster! Go faster!” Michael shrieked, hitting an early high note. He was sitting in the front of a shopping cart— knees to chin—while Tito, Marlon and I were running and pushing it down 23rd Avenue, me with both hands on the handlebar, and my two brothers either side as the wheels wobbled and bounced off the road on a summer’s day. We built up speed and powered forward like a bobsled team. Except this, in our minds, was a train. We’d find two, sometimes three, shopping carts from the nearby Giants supermarket and couple them together. Giants was about three blocks away, located across the sports field at the back of our home, but its carts were often abandoned and strewn about the streets, so they were easy to commandeer. Michael was “the driver.”\n\nHe was crazy about Lionel toy trains—small but weighty model steam engines and locomotives, packaged in orange boxes. Whenever Mother took us shopping for clothes at the Salvation Army, he always darted upstairs to the toy section to see if anyone had donated a secondhand Lionel train set. So, in his imagination, our shopping carts became two or three railroad cars, and 23rd Avenue was the straight section of track. It was a train that went too fast to pick up other passengers, thundering along, as Michael provided the sound effects. We hit the brakes when 23rd Avenue ran into a dead end, about 50 yards from the back of our house.\n\nIf Michael wasn’t on the street playing trains, he was on the carpet in our shared bedroom with his prized Lionel engine. Our parents couldn’t afford to buy him a new one, or invest in an electric- train set, complete with full length track, station, and signal boxes. That is why the dream of owning a train set was in his head long before the dream of performing.\n\nSpeed. I’m convinced our excitement as kids was built on the thrill of speed. Whatever we did involved going faster, trying to outgun one another. Had our father known the extent of our thirst for speed, he would have banned it for sure: the potential for injury was always considered a grave risk to our career.\n\nOnce we grew bored of the shopping-cart trains, we built go-carts, constructed from boxes, stroller wheels and planks of wood from a nearby junkyard. Tito was the “engineer” of the brotherhood and he had the know-how in putting everything together. He was forever dismantling clocks and radios, and reassembling them on the kitchen table, or watching Joseph under the hood of his Buick parked at the side of the house, so he knew where our father’s tool box was. We hammered together three planks to form an I-shaped chassis and axle. We nailed the open cockpit—a square wooden box—on top, and took cord from a clothes line for our steering mechanism, looping it through the front wheels, held like reins. In truth, our turning circle was about as tight as an oil tanker’s, so we only ever traveled in straight lines.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.legendarymichaeljackson.nl/?p=6026\n\nMichael's Words of Wisdom\n\nToday I received the following story in my inbox. It reminded me of a quote or short story by Michael from Dancing the Divine.\n\nWhen I came home I immediately leafed through Dancing the Divine and I smiled when I had found it. No explanations are necessary here, I think, as the words will speak to your heart and your inner child of wisdom:\n\nOne day the student asked the teacher: \"Can you recommend me a book that describes the truth behind the mystery of life ?\"\n\nThe teacher, who had a few books of his own in his bookcase, reached for a book that dealt with the secrets and miraculous powers of water and about the meaning of water for life on earth. He gave the book to his student and said: \"Take it between both hands and wring it.\"\n\nThe student looked surprised, but did as he was told. He wrung and wrung, but the teacher said: \"You need to wring harder.\"\n\nThe student tried his very best, but the teacher coaxed: \"come on, try harder!\"\n\nThis continued for a while. Finally the student gave up, not knowing the purpose behind it.\n\nThe teacher asked him: \"And, were you able to wring any water from the book ?\"\n\n\"No, of course not!\"\n\n\"You see,\" the teacher said, \"no water comes from a book about water, and a book about truth does not give you the truth.\"\n\nAnd then I read these words by Michael:\n\nChildren show me in their playful smiles the divine in everyone. This simple goodness shines straight from their hearts. This has so much to teach. If a child wants chocolate ice cream, he just asks for it. Adults get tangled up in complications over whether to eat the ice cream or not. A child simply enjoys.\n\nWhat we need to learn from children isn't childish. Being with them connects us to the deep wisdom of life, which is everpresent and only asks to be lived. Now, when the world is so confused and its problems so complicated, I feel we need out children more than ever. Their natural wisdom points the way to solutions that lie, waiting to be recognized, within our own hearts.\n\nSource:\n\nDancing the Dream\n\nJonathan Moffett on Michael's Magic and Magnetism\n\nJonathan, people speak of an energy around Michael; a light. Did you ever feel that?\n\nJonathan: All the time, every time I am around him. That’s why you know you are in the presence of greatness. That’s why you know you’re in the presence of somebody special. Just count the number of fans and people and the multitude that love him around the world. He’s one man loved by… CNN said that over one billion people mourned Michael from all the remote areas of the world, as well as all the known areas. What other human being can draw that much sympathy and that much hurt from their loss. Michael had something special, a radiance, and when you were in his presence the whole room changed.\n\nPeople would say, “Michael’s coming,” and everybody got nervous. As soon as you had the vision of him, even just knowing he was coming, you felt something, like a tingle happening. Just to watch him walk through the door, it’s like all the molecules in the air stop and you can pinch them with your finger; pick them up. It’s like you could see the smallest speck; you could see the molecules in the air when Michael walked in the room. He changed them; the molecular structure of the air. And that’s the equation of what happens when Michael enters, and everybody in the room felt it and knew it. Then their attitudes and personalities would change. They would perk up their attention, but they would always say, “There’s something with him. When he came in I got nervous. I felt something!” And I would hear that over and over again and I would say, “I know, I know. I’ve been feeling it for thirty years.”\n\nAnd he was just so pleasant; just something with his imagery. Everybody radiates from a different frequency, and Michael had the highest level of energy I think without being from another world. His gift and his humanity of spirit were just so powerful and great and deep. He was a different human being from most of us; from all of us. He did affect everybody that came around him, from leaders of the world to normal folk, from children to people, grandmothers. Every single person that’s been around him said they felt something, that I remember seeing or talking to.\n\nAnd that’s why people cry. People absolutely cry. I would sit on stage and watch them pass bodies, like back in the medieval days when people died of the plague. You would see them lift bodies, arms dangling and legs, heads swinging, and there was like an ocean of people with their arms up passing bodies to the front, to the gate. There would be a line-up there of emergency vehicles… five, ten of them lined up. There were stretchers and triages back there. One by one, people were passing them forward; sometimes a multitude of bodies moving across the crowd being passed to the rescue people. They would give them smelling salts and try to revive them. Some people were just totally gone, unconscious, you know, like totally no life in them, and that’s just from being in that stadium with Michael. I just got to just sit back there and marvel at it. It was just the most powerful thing to see, and that’s just from that one man in the center of the stage. He made even men pass out; women and men. That’s a power and Michael knew it. He knew he was gifted with something special, a purpose; uniting the world and uniting people.\n\n- Jonathan Moffett, drummer\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/photo.php?f...29116516.14661.100001834795939&type=3&theater\n\nIT'S WHAT YOU SCATTER\n\nI was at the corner grocery store buying some early potatoes... I noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but clean, hungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas.\n\nI paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas. I am a pushover for creamed peas and new potatoes.\n\nPondering the peas, I couldn't help overhearing the conversation between Mr. Miller (the store owner) and the ragged boy next to me.\n\n'Hello Barry, how are you today?'\n\n'H'lo, Mr. Miller. Fine, thank ya. Jus' admirin' them peas. They sure look good'\n\n'They are good, Barry. How's your Ma?'\n\n'Fine. Gittin' stronger alla' time.'\n\n'Good. Anything I can help you with?'\n\n'No, Sir. Jus' admirin' them peas.'\n\n'Would you like to take some home?' asked Mr. Miller.\n\n'No, Sir. Got nuthin' to pay for 'em with.'\n\n'Well, what have you to trade me for some of those peas?'\n\n'All I got's my prize marble here.'\n\n'Is that right? Let me see it', said Miller.\n\n'Here 'tis. She's a dandy.'\n\n'I can see that. Hmm mmm, only thing is this one is blue and I sort of go for red. Do you have a red one like this at home?' the store owner asked.\n\n'Not zackley but almost.'\n\n'Tell you what. Take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble'. Mr. Miller told the boy.\n\n'Sure will. Thanks Mr. Miller.'\n\nMrs. Miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me.\n\nWith a smile she said, 'There are two other boys like him in our community, all three are in very poor circumstances. Jim just loves to bargain with them for peas, apples, tomatoes, or whatever.\n\nWhen they come back with their red marbles, and they always do, he decides he doesn't like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one, when they come on their next trip to the store.'\n\nI left the store smiling to myself, impressed with this man. A short time later I moved to Colorado , but I never forgot the story of this man, the boys, and their bartering for marbles.\n\nSeveral years went by, each more rapid than the previous one. Just recently I had occasion to visit some old friends in that Idaho community and while I was there learned that Mr. Miller had died. They were having his visitation that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go, I agreed to accompany them. Upon arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could.\n\nAhead of us in line were three young men. One was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark suits and white shirts...all very professional looking. They approached Mrs. Miller, standing composed and smiling by her husband's casket.\n\nEach of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the cheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket. Her misty light blue eyes followed them as, one by one; each young man stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the casket. Each left the mortuary awkwardly, wiping his eyes.\n\nOur turn came to meet Mrs. Miller. I told her who I was and reminded her of the story from those many years ago and what she had told me about her husband's bartering for marbles. With her eyes glistening, she took my hand and led me to the casket.\n\n'Those three young men who just left were the boys I told you about.\n\nThey just told me how they appreciated the things Jim 'traded' them. Now, at last, when Jim could not change his mind about color or size....they came to pay their debt.'\n\n'We've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world,' she confided, 'but right now, Jim would consider himself the richest man in Idaho ...'\n\nWith loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased husband. Resting underneath were three exquisitely shined red marbles.\n\nThe Moral:\n\nWe will not be remembered by our words, but by our kind deeds. Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.\n\nSound doesn't start until 1:07.\n\nBeauty\n\nOn Beauty\n\nKahlil Gibran\n\nWhere shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?\n\nAnd how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?\n\nThe aggrieved and the injured say, \"Beauty is kind and gentle.\n\nLike a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.\"\n\nAnd the passionate say, \"Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.\n\nLike the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us.\"\n\nThe tired and the weary say, \"Beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.\n\nHer voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow.\"\n\nBut the restless say, \"We have heard her shouting among the mountains,\n\nAnd with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions.\"\n\nAt night the watchmen of the city say, \"Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east.\"\n\nAnd at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say,\n\n\"We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset.\"\n\nIn winter say the snow-bound, \"She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills.\"\n\nAnd in the summer heat the reapers say,\n\n\"We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves,\n\nand we saw a drift of snow in her hair.\"\n\nAll these things have you said of beauty,\n\nYet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,\n\nAnd beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.\n\nIt is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,\n\nBut rather a heart enflamed and a soul enchanted.\n\nIt is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,\n\nBut rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.\n\nIt is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,\n\nBut rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.\n\nPeople of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.\n\nBut you are life and you are the veil.\n\nBeauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.\n\nBut you are eternity and you are the mirror.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.katsandogz.com/onbeauty.html"
