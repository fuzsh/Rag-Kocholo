        "text": "Betty Compson, the blond star of more than 100 silent films and early talkies, died Thursday in Glendale, Calif. The actress, who attained fame as Rose in “The Miracle Man,” the film that also catapulted Lon Chaney into stardom, was 77 years old.\n\nAt the height of her film career during the nineteen‐twenties, Miss Compson belonged to that select circle of superstars who earned more than $5,000 week, owned a string of limousines and lived in a mansion with numerous servants.\n\nShe was born March 18, 1897, in Beaver, Utah, but soon moved with her family to Salt Lake City, where, as a young woman, she worked as a nurse before going into vaudeville as a violinist.\n\nMiss Compson's film career began in 1915 when she was signed by Al Christie to appear in his comedies. During three‐year period, she played in 78 Christie two‐reelers, many of them with Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle, but her career began to drift until she was signed by George Loane Tucker for “The Miracle Man.”\n\nThere followed a succession of more than 35 feature films, including “The Little Minister,” “The Green Temptation,” “To Have and to Hold,” “Prisoners of Love,” and “Woman to Woman,” with Clive Brook.\n\nMiss Compson successfully made the transition from silent films to talkies when she appeared in R.K.O.'s first sound film, “Street Girl,” made in 1929.\n\nHer other films Included “The Docks of New York,” presented in 1928, “The Spoilers,” with Gary Cooper and William Boyd; “The Case of Sergeant Grischa,” with Chester Morris; “The Silver Lining,” “She Got What She Wanted,” with Lee Tracy; “Blaze of Glory,” with Eddie Dowling; “The Great Gabbo,” with Erich von Stroheim; “The Female,” with Noah Beery; “Scarlet Seas,” with Richard Barthelmess and “The Barker,” with Milton Sills.\n\nMiss Compson was married three times. Her first marriage was to James. Cruze, director of “The Covered Wagon,” and it was through a complicated marital contract with him that the star lost most of her savings. Following the breakup of the marriage, it was discovered, that Mr. Cruze had paid no income tax for several years and the Federal Government sued Miss Compson for $150,000 in cash, her home, her automobiles, and her antiques.\n\nHer second marriage, to Irving Weinberg, her manager, also ended in divorce. Miss Compson's third husband, Silvius Jack Gall, died in 1962."
