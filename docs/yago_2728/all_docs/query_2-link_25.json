        "meta_description": "American postcard. Krauss Mfg. Co., New York. Thanhouser.\n\t\n\tPostcard for James Cruze in the 23 episodes serial The Million Dollar Mystery (Howard Hansel, Thanhouser 1914), starring Cruze and Florence La Badie. The retro says the actor will personally appear at the The Crescent Theater on Saturday, May 22nd., &quot;to tell about his experiences in the motion picture world and shake hands with all his admirers&quot;. The serial is presumably lost. This card refers to a screening on Saturday, 22 May 1915, while the serial had started in June 1914. The Crescent may refer to the Ithaca cinema The Crescent, that opened in 1914. Its rival, the Star cinema, had shown the serial in Summer 1914.\n\t\n\t<b>James Cruze</b> (1884-1942) was an American actor and director of the silent screen.\n\t\n\tJames Cruze, who had Danish ancestors as the son of a Mormon family, initially worked as a fisherman to earn a degree from an acting academy. At the age of 16, he already played first roles on the stage and in 1906 he became a member of the then well-known Belasco troupe, with whom he performed regularly on Broadway. Already in 1908 he changed profession and participated in countless films of first  Lubin (from 1910), and from 1912, the Thanhouser film company, both Eastcoast companies. When Ed Thanhouser returned to the company in 1915, Cruze's was dismissed, despite the succes of his serials The Million Dollar Mystery and Zudora (both 1914). He moved to Hollywood in the mid-1910s and began his career as a director in 1919, primarily for Paramount.\n\t\n\tJames Cruze was known as a distinguished multi-worker who was at home in every genre. He first became known through several comedies with Wallace Reid and Fatty Arbuckle in the lead role, but most of the Arbuckle comedies were withdrawn and destroyed after 1921, at the height of the scandal around the silent film actor.  Cruze's best-known film is the western The Covered Wagon, created in 1923, depicting the migration of German emigrants to the West of North America and their conflicts with each other and with Indians. The film was carefully researched with great eye for detail. It was one of the most commercially successful representatives of his genre from the early days of film and received in 1923 a Photoplay Award and a Kinema Junpo Award. James Cruze' s film Hollywood, also released in 1923, was the first film to cast a critical eye over the façade of the dream factory, relentlessly revealing the manipulation of the audience through partially fictitious stories about the stars of the screen. At the same time the film was a tribute to Fatty Arbuckle and did not spare criticism on the behavior of the producers towards the actor. In 1925, Cruze took over the technique of German Expressionism for work on Beggar on a Horseback and was able to convince the critics with a dense dramaturgy and for the time exciting new camera settings. His demise began the following year, as the western Old Ironside, produced with high financial cost, flopped at the box office. It wasn't until 1930 with King Vidor's Billy the Kid, before again a lavishly produced Western came into the national cinemas.\n\t\n\tIn the following years, Cruze turned out mainly routine films for numerous societies, including the William Haines - Joan Crawford romance The Duke Steps Out from 1929. In the same year he shot with The Great Gabbo his first sound film, the main roles were taken by Erich von Stroheim and Cruze's then wife, Betty Compson. In the 1930s, Cruze's career faltered and in 1938 he retired after some B-movies. In 1942 he died completely impoverished and largely forgotten.\n\t\n\tAfter a ten-year marriage with actress Marguerite Snow, James Cruze was married to actress Betty Compson, and the couple's tumultuous clashes filled the gossip press. Their divorce in 1930 was a mud battle, much to the media's attention. In 1941 he marrried his third wife, Alberta McCoy. Cruze was often involved in conflict with the law and in 1929 had to endure a lawsuit in which he was accused of being responsible for the deaths of some actors while filming one of his films.\n\t\n\tA star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today commemorates James Cruze.\n\t\n\tSources: English and German Wikipedia, IMDB.",
