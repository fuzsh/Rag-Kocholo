        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\n'The Great Gabbo' is an early talkie based on the story 'The Rival Dummy' by Ben Hecht. Gifted ventriloquist \"The Great Gabbo\" (Erich Von Stroheim) finds his sanity being questioned when he reacts angrily to his dummy Otto having become more popular than him. Their relationship is complicated further by dancer Mary (Betty Compson), the ventriloquist's former stage assistant.\n\n\"James Cruze’s early life sounds like excellent preparation for his most famous film as director, The Covered Wagon (1923). Born on an Indian reservation near Vernal, Utah, he was part Ute Indian, and raised in the Mormon faith. (While his stage name sounds Spanish, he was mostly of Danish extraction. The “Vera Cruz” part of his given name was in honor the Siege of Veracruz, an action in the Mexcican-American War). Cruze ran away from home as a teenager because he disliked farm work. He is said to have performed in medicine shows, and later worked as a fisherman to earn his tuition for drama school.\"\n\n- Trav S.D., 'James Cruze : Of Wagons And Waterfronts'\n\nErich Von Stroheim & Fay Wray\n\n'The Great Gabbo' is a fascinating soundie helmed by the great American director James Cruze that's studded with short, exuberant musical numbers. There's a chorus line and several stage acts in addition to Erich Von Stroheim's remarkable double-act with Otto who loves to sing for his lollipop. I enjoyed every act on display but the spider ballet is an absolute knockout.\n\n\"The Great Gabbo is one terrific early talkie. Sure, the film is old and creaky, while its technical aspects are cheap and primitive. But the story, the music, and the performances always keep me hooked. Directed by James Cruze, a top name in the silent era, from a story by Ben Hecht (continuity and dialogue by Hugh Herbert), The Great Gabbo follows an arrogant ventriloquist, that's the Gabbo of the title (Erich von Stroheim), who abuses his girlfriend-cum-assistant (Cruze's then wife, Betty Compson) one too many times.\"\n\n- Danny Fortune, Alternative Film Guide\n\nErich Von Stroheim & Betty Compson in 'The Great Gabbo'\n\n'Chameleon' - Herbie Hancock & Tal Wilkenfeld\n\nThe abrasive text treads a fine line between understandable delusion and teetering madness, refusing to hide its underlying contempt for the seedy underbelly of an entertainment world in which 'Variety' is the holy bible. Creepy, trippy and highly suggestive, 'The Great Gabbo' creates a designed screen for artistic perversion that turns into a sado-masochistic surprise.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nThis sounds fascinating, petrolino. I'm only familiar Cruze that far back as the director of The Covered Wagon (1923) - and why that one, I do not remember; some historical significance, I'm sure, but I can't remember what. Anyway The Great Gabbo sounds fascinating, though perhaps in the end a little disquieting. Thanks for the elegant write-up, and I will keep an eye out for it.\n\nHey spiderwort. No need to ever worry for mentioning Frank Borzage, one of the all-time great directors! In fact, you remind me it's high time I dug out a new viewing from this poetic master.\n\nI think James Cruze has a similarly poetic nature deep down, but perhaps he's a bit raunchier with it, truth be told. I recently posted on Classic Film in positive fashion about his excellent thriller 'I Cover The Waterfront' (1933) - making sure to add a hothouse jazz number from that incomparable Dakotan powerhouse Peggy Lee. Now that's what I call music!\n\nPost by BATouttaheck on\n\nWe just played a Bakers Dozen game over on the Games board and came up with these :\n\n13 Movie Characters who are VENTRILOQUISTS\n\n01. Corky (Anthony Hopkins) - MAGIC\n\n02. Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts) - DEAD SILENCE\n\n03. Steven (Adrien Brody) - DUMMY\n\n04. Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray) - CRADLE WILL ROCK\n\n05. Maxwell Frere (Michael Redgrave) - DEAD OF NIGHT\n\n06. The Great Voleri (Bryant Haliday) - DEVIL DOLL\n\n07. Ventriloquist on train (Roger De Courcey) - THE 39 STEPS (2008)\n\n08. Paul Chandler (Keith Singleton) - THE DUMMY (2000)\n\n09. Edgar Bergen (as himself) STAGE DOOR CANTEEN\n\n10. Jerry Morgan (Danny Kaye) - KNOCK ON WOOD\n\n11. Paul Winchell (as himself) - STOP, LOOK AND LAUGH!\n\n12. Professor Echo (Lon Chaney, Sr) THE UNHOLY THREE (1925 AND 1930)\n\n13. Erich von Stroheim as THE GREAT GABBO\n\nI saw The Great Gabbo at the Museum of Modern Art ages ago an must have liked it as I have no recollection of disliking it !\n\nThanks for the informative and fun thread (again) petrolino"
