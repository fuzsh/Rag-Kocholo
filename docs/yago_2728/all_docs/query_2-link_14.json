        "text": "Married. Manfred Gottfried, political editor of TIME, the weekly news-magazine, to Miss Ruth Jeremiah of Manhattan; in Manhattan.\n\nMarried. Henry P. Davison Jr., 26, son of the late Henry P. Davison, Chairman of the American Red Cross during the war, to Miss Anne Stillman of Pleasantville, N. Y.; at Pleasantville.\n\nMarried. Alfred E. Smith Jr., eldest son of New York’s Governor, to Miss Bertha Gott of Syracuse; in Manhattan, following an elopement. Immediately upon being introduced to his daughter-in-law, Governor Al telephoned the young lady’s mother. Said he: “Are you the mother-in-law of my son? . . . Well, are you satisfied with him? . . . Well, we’re satisfied with our daughter-in-law; and I guess every-thing is all right!” Said the Dally News, Manhattan gum-chewers’ sheet-let : “A good father, a good Governor and now a good father-in-law. What more do we want? All the lovers in the State ought to vote for Al after that.”\n\nMarried. Marie Prevost, cinema actress, to Kenneth Harlan, cinema actor; in Los Angeles. This is her second marriage; his third. Married. Betty Compson, cinema actress, to James Cruze, cinema director; in Los Angeles. This—is her first marriage; his second.\n\nMarried. Carl E. Akeley, 60, explorer, sculptor, to Miss Mary Lee Jobe, 38, mountain climber; in Manhattan. She was the first person to climb Mt. Sir Alexander, a high peak in the Canadian Rockies. He, onetime intimate friend of President Roosevelt, was a storm centre last spring when his Chrysalis—a bronze depicting Man emerging from the hide of a gorilla (TIME, Mar. 24, ART)—was rejected by the National Academy of Design at its exhibit in Manhattan.\n\nDied. Admiral Sir Percy Scott, 71, “Defender of London”; in London. Sir Percy, famed as a naval authority, during the War organized the British Capital against attack by air. Many were his naval inventions—signaling apparatus, firing devices—all designed to perfect smaller vessels to take the place of battleships, which he disliked because of their clumsiness. Gunnery was his preoccupation; accuracy, his pride. When the squadron he com-manded was lying off Portland to receive the German Emperor on his visit to England in 1907, Admiral Scott signaled to a cruiser which tarried outside for further target drill: “Paint work seems to be more in demand than gunnery so you had better come inside to paint and look pretty.” Admiral Lord Charles Beresford had this signal stricken from the logs as “contemptuous in tone and insubordinate in character.” Said the late Lord Fisher of Admiral Scott: “He hits the mark.”\n\nDied. Herman H. Kohlsaat, 71, famed editor; at the home of Secretary of Commerce Hoover, where he was visiting, in Washington, D. C., following a stroke of paralysis. The friend of five Presidents—McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, four of whom are now dead—he started his career as a caterer, later selling the chain of restaurants, which he controlled, and entering the newspaper field in Chicago. He owned and edited at different times the Chicago Inter-Ocean, Times-Herald, Record-Herald, Evening Post. His services to the Republican cause brought him into contact with many a famed man, made it possible for him—for he never accepted an office—to become great by refusing greatness, notorious while shunning noitoriety. A genial, meagre, shrewd little man, he had a talent for friendship and an ability to stick to his principles, no matter how little they profited him. He told about his political adventures in a book of memoirs, From McKinley to Harding. One of his greatest coups was his success in having the word “gold” inserted in the Republican platform in 1896."
