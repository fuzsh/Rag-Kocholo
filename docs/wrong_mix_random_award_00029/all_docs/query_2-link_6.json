Despite being incredibly smart, Kay is terrified that their lack of social skills will make it impossible for them to lead normal lives. She and Mike therefore decide to take the kids on a trip to the boardwalk. Unfortunately, Brian insists on bringing his nerdy 35-year old friend along, Nicole refuses to leave after learning that she has a lower IQ than her brother, and Marc trashes the house for an “experiment”. Kay has had enough and Mike steps in, telling the kids he’s disappointed in them. The fourth child, Leila, then lies and tells her siblings that Kay wanted to do something special for her birthday. Out of guilt, the kids pitch in to make up for their poor behavior by building a replica boardwalk for Kay in the house.\n\n2\"The Talk\"Betsy ThomasLon ZimmetJanuary 30, 2020 ( )1BYF022.34[17]\n\nWhen Mike and Kay find Brian 3D-printing an artificial heart valve, they mistake it for a female private part. They try to give Brian and Nicole the sex talk but it backfires and the children end up giving them the talk instead. After this, Nicole and Brian become convinced that they're old enough to be having sex. Brian prints a 3D face to practice kissing. Nicole comes up with potential boys to be her first kiss but when Leila gets into her head, she gets worried that she'll be bad at it. She tries to practice kissing on her brother's 3D face, but he refuses. When Kay and Mike catch them fighting over it, they help the children realize that there's no need to rush and should wait until they're ready.\n\n3\"Grandparents\"Betsy ThomasDan RubinFebruary 6, 2020 ( )1BYF052.66[18]\n\nMike's parents visit; his father Jay continues to criticize his son for not raising his kids properly while Kay has to deal with his overbearing mother Sylvia. Jay is embarrassed to learn that Brian doesn't know how to drive and ignores Mike's insistence that he be the one to teach him. Sylvia helps Nicole get a full Jersey girl makeover, upsetting Kay who feels excluded. When Jay lies about having a heart attack to motivate him, Brian drives off and Mike and Jay go after him. They make amends while Kay and Sylvia talk and Kay realizes that Sylvia barely speaks with Mike anymore and therefore does what she can to stay in touch with him. Brian decides he wants to learn to drive by starting with a bicycle.\n\n4\"Bad Guy\"Victor GonzalezMathew HarawitzFebruary 13, 2020 ( )1BYF042.17[19]\n\nTired of their parents' strict rules, Nicole and Brian ask for permission to move into their own apartment. Mike refuses, but then caves in and says yes as he fears being disliked. Kay has to go to Leila's school for a popcorn fundraiser, where Rita makes her stand up to Kourtney, the verbally abusive organizer. The fundraiser quickly falls apart, and Kay and Leila have to finish making the popcorn themselves. Mike tells his kids to earn $15,000 before he'll sign off on the apartment, but the effort fails and Kay steps in to ground them when they start bickering; Nicole and Brian admit that they want to be disciplined and agree to stay. Mike repays her by patching things up with Kourtney.\n\n5\"Dating\"Jonathan JudgeHeather MacGillvray & Linda MathiousFebruary 20, 2020 ( )1BYF072.02[20]\n\nNicole starts dating Tyler, an older boy who reminds Kay of all the losers she dated in high school. Terrified that the same thing will happen to Nicole, she decides to break them up. Mike discovers that Marc has become unusually attracted to a painting in the local museum. His son tells him to talk to the painting, which allows Mike to vent about how he doesn't understand his children and wishes they were normal. Kay and Nicole argue about what's good for her, and Nicole insults her mother, for which she gets grounded. The next day, Kay learns that Tyler did in fact cheat on Nicole, and helps her get some closure by taking both of her daughters to throw toilet paper at his house.\n\n6\"Bullying\"Betsy ThomasLon ZimmetFebruary 27, 2020 ( )1BYF062.47[21]\n\nMarc is disciplined for bullying his homeroom teacher, so Mike and Kay apply to a local charter school thinking it would be more suitable for him. However, the school administrator, Dr. Walker, refuses to admit Marc because Kay bullied him in high school. Kay invites him for dinner to smooth things over, but realizes that not only is she unwilling to apologize, her own children are now emulating the same bullying behavior. When Walker demands Kay make a humiliating apology and insults her, Marc and his siblings stand up for their mother and drive him off. Marc informs his parents that he will apologize to his teacher to prove he can be a better person.\n\n7\"Failing\"Michael McDonaldSeth Raab & Nicholas DarrowMarch 5, 2020 ( )1BYF032.01[22]\n\nIrwin warns Mike and Kay that Nicole, a perfectionist who has never failed at anything, is unprepared for when she inevitably fails in life. In response, they decide to enter her into the casino's beauty pageant, figuring there's no way she can win. Nicole does win, however, to her dismay as she wanted to lose. Kay and Mike use the opportunity to teach her that failure can in fact be good, since losers get to do things \"winners\" can't. Brian agrees to play with Leila only because he thinks doing so will help him learn how to beat Marc at chess. Ultimately, he realizes he likes playing with his sister more than his constant need to outshine his siblings.\n\n8\"Couple's Friends\"Betsy ThomasNicole SunMarch 12, 2020 ( )1BYF081.99[23]\n\nMike and Kay are left behind when Rita and Irwin throw a party for their other friends; to compensate, they decide to make new ones by befriending Beth and Sigmund, two buttoned-up parents hyper-focused on the needs of their son Atticus, Nicole and Brian's science fair partner. Kay invites her new friends to indulge in drinking and games, and when Nicole and Brian kick them out of the house for being too loud, take them to the casino. Unfortunately, Beth and Sigmund drink too much, and consequently Brian, Atticus, and Nicole lose an important competition. To fix things with their children, Mike and Kay end their new friendship and go to Rita and Irwin's party instead.\n\n9\"Black Mold\"Victor GonzalezCaroline Fox & Mariah SmithMarch 19, 2020 ( )1BYF092.58[24]\n\nWhen the basement has to be cleaned due to a mold infestation, Mike and Kay become exceedingly cranky. Nicole and Brian get them a room at the casino for the night to relax while they talk their parents into letting them take care of the house; they quickly screw things up by accidentally feeding Marc and Leila caffeine and then have to leave the house when someone breaks in. Kay and Mike have to briefly leave their room, only to find it's been given to an elderly couple as their kids neglected to pay for it. Tired and miserable, they finally admit to each other that all they really need is some time alone, which is also ruined when their kids suddenly show up out of nowhere.\n\n10\"Royal Rumble\"Anthony RichCarson Brand & Hannah LevitanMarch 26, 2020 ( )1BYF102.38[25]"
