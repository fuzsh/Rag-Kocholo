Regions like the Galápagos Islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), with an extended history of bleaching, provide a natural laboratory for understanding the long-term effects of repeat bleaching and the mechanisms of thermal tolerance. The upcoming El Niño has a 90% chance of inducing a level 2 bleaching event in the ETP in the next four months. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms of coral thermal tolerance during this event. Our prior data, based on acute heat stress experiments, suggest that coral genotype and symbiont composition set thermal tolerance in Galápagos Pocilloporids. In collaboration with the Galápagos Reef Revival project, we will take advantage of an existing coral nursery to track the fate of individual corals and the mechanisms underlying their responses during a natural thermal stress event. Objective 1 will be to examine the genotype and symbiont/microbial community composition of 38 coral colonies located in the nursery prior to the El Niño (early July 2023). Objective 2 will be to outplant coral colonies at three locations and track their survival, bleaching status, growth, and symbiont/microbial communities four and nine months later. These data will enable us to model the role of phenotypic plasticity and genetics in setting thermal tolerance, and to validate the ability of acute thermal stress assays to predict responses in the field. By unraveling the mechanisms of thermal tolerance in this unique region, we will advance knowledge of coral thermal tolerance mechanisms in marginal habitats which may serve as analogs for future climate change conditions worldwide. In addition, the identification of thermally “tough” corals will help in ongoing restoration efforts across the Galápagos archipelago.​\n\nMonterey Bay2023-24 Rapid Response Program Year And Program : 2022-23 State Science Information Needs Program ‎(1)\n\nEcophysiology of Olympia oysters grown in aquaculture, and implications for o utplanting success\n\nKahnAmandaState Science Information Needs Program2022-23\n\nOlympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) are the only native oyster species along the California coastline. Their populations have declined due to overharvest and habitat degradation. Recently, conservation aquaculture has been used in an attempt to replenish oyster numbers to sufficient amount to successfully reproduce in the wild. We will study the physiology of Olympia oysters grown in aquaculture to specifically optimize growing conditions for adult fitness and outplanting success for Elkhorn Slough. We will do this by measuring particle capture (energy uptake) and metabolic rates (energy expenditure) of early life stages of oysters in culture. We will also determine scope for growth of adult oysters when brooding embryos to determine whether that is a bottleneck leading to reproductive failure. Combined, these studies will help us identify whether the reproductive failures in Elkhorn Slough are caused by fertilization failure, developmental failure, the cost of brooding, or of growing from embryos to adults. Finally, we will assess how scope for growth of juvenile and mature oysters may change under current and future habitat conditions (temperature and turbidity) in Elkhorn Slough.​ Our work will focus on understanding the energetics and metabolism of captive reared Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida). Metabolic rates will be measured from three different life stages (free-swimming larvae, newly settled juveniles, and adults used as broodstock) using closed chamber respirometry. The most energetically expensive stages are likely \"energetic bottlenecks\" that could influence survival. We will also look at the balance of food energy taken up by adult oysters (as the amount of food eaten) and the amount of food energy spent on various processes (typified by respiration and excretion of urine and feces). The amount of energy left over after those costs have been spent is the 'scope for growth' and indicates the amount of e nergy available for oysters to grow and reproduce. With reproductive failures occurring in wild populations in Elkhorn Slough in recent years, it will be important to understand the scope for growth of oysters at different stages, especially during reproduction, to find out why these reproductive failures are occurring. Finally, we will manipulate food, temperature, and turbidity conditions to assess how Olympia oysters will fare in current and future habitat conditions in Elkhorn Slough. Captive rearing is a promising approach to mitigate the recent decline and reproductive failures of Ostrea lurida in Elkhorn Slough. Now that a proof-of- concept has demonstrated that these oysters can be reared, it is important to optimize the process. Clarifying the scope for growth of Olympia oysters at​ different stages and under different growth conditions will lead to greater survivorship, and will point to potential energetic bottlenecks at different life stages in captive reared and wild populations. This work will specifically and directly benefit restoration efforts to the Elkhorn Slough oyster population, but also to other groups doing small-scale conservation aquaculture. With restoration efforts underway up and down the west coast, the results of this research will be communicated to other stakeholders and participants in NOOC to be applied to their populations as well. More regions may consider adopting restorative aquaculture for their populations, and understanding which life stages are most sensitive will help in all restoration efforts. Results of our research will be of interest to commercial growers interested in adding Olympia oysters to their grower portfolio. Olympia oysters appear to be more resistant to acidification and suffer from fewer diseases than Crassostrea gigas. While they are more expensive to raise, O. lurida can be sold to a niche market, as is done with grass-fed beef or local organic produce. Certain consumers would be glad to pay more knowing that raising a native species could benefit wild populations due to larval spillover.\n\nSan José$29,9742022-23 State Science Information Needs Program Year And Program : 2022-23 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program ‎(1)\n\nComprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography short c​ourse for COAST research enhancement\n\nVozkaPetrShort Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program2022-23\n\nA comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) has become the state-of-the-art technique/instrument for analyzing complex (volatile or semi-volatile) samples and has emerged as a powerful separation tool for studying environmental samples, petroleum fractions, persistent organic pollutants, drugs, etc. The benefits include increased resolution and selectivity (compared to GC-MS), and structured two-dimensional chromatograms. Since most CSU campuses do not have GC×GC capability, their research is limited by not having all the GC×GC advantages. This free two-day Short Course aims to enhance COAST research projects. In this course, participants will gain hands-on experience and knowledge in GC×GC. They will be introduced to several GC×GC applications, mostly related to COAST. This short course will also promote collaboration between faculty and demonstrate GC×GC separation power on their samples. Faculty might implement GC×GC in their research laboratories to get more data from their samples or expand their research area. This short course supports COAST's objectives to equip CSU faculty and students with state-of-the-art techniques and deepen collaborations between CSU faculty.​\n\nLos Angeles2022-23 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program Year And Program : 2022-23 Rapid Response Program ‎(2)\n\nCharacterizing primary production and nutrient uptake of a rare, widespread, and persistent bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo in the San Francisco Estuary​\n\nParkerAlexanderWilkersonFrancesDugdaleRichardRapid Response Program2022-23\n\nThis proposal seeks funds to measure rates of carbon and nitrogen uptake by a rare, widespread, and persistent harmful algal bloom (HAB) occurring the San Francisco Estuary. The bloom species, Heterosigma akashiwo, is a mixotrophic red-tide species known for producing episodic toxic blooms in high nutrient surface coastal waters. Last observed in the San Francisco Bay in 2002, the present H. akashiwo bloom was first detected in Central San Francisco Bay, near Alameda in late July. Since that time, the bloom has grown in algal density and geographic extent, extending down into South San Francisco Bay as well as north into the mesohaline San Pablo Bay. During late August reports of fish kills began and CA public health officials have recommended that people and pets avoid prolonged exposure to the Bay’s waters. While the mechanism that gave rise to the current bloom is yet to be determined, it is widely assumed that the persistence and geographic expansion of the bloom is driven in part to high inorganic nutrient concentrations) supplied via municipal wastewater treatment facilities. State and federal natural resource agencies have been monitoring the bloom’s progression but to date we are not aware of any measurements of algal primary production or nitrogen uptake. H. akashiwo has been shown to grow well on ammonium-N, nitrate-N and urea-N but shows better assimilative capacity for NH4. The objectives of this study are to measure dissolved inorganic nutrients and rates of primary production and nitrogen uptake (ammonium-N and nitrate-N) by the Heterosigma bloom from late August through September 2022. We hypothesize that the HAB was able to take advantage of elevated nutrient concentrations supplied through WWTP effluent to support bloom growth and expansion.\n\nMaritime AcademySan FranciscoSan Francisco2022-23 Rapid Response Program\n\nGoNORTH 2023: An expedition to the slowest spreading center on planet Earth​\n\nPortnerRyanRapid Response Program2022-23\n\nA recent invitation to join a Norwegian research expedition to the ice-covered Arctic Ocean in July 2023 presents an extraordinary opportunity to investigate one of the most difficult to reach mid-ocean ridges on the planet, the Gakkel Ridge. This ultra-slow spreading ridge exhibits unusual lava chemistry with high CO2 contents that are thought to have caused rare deep-marine explosive eruptions. Our understanding of the extent and nature of these eruption deposits is however limited to two ROV suction samples and bottom observations from a 2007 cruise. Devoted sediment coring programs that include follow-up physical and chemical analyses of volcanic ash is critical for developing models of deep-marine explosive eruptions, which are still poorly understood. The unusual lava chemistry and great depth of the Gakkel Ridge (~4850 mbsl) makes it an archetype setting for such study, since non-explosive ash generation by lava-water interaction is not possible below the critical point of seawater (>3000 mbsl). Samples collected by this project will characterize the extent of volcanic ash dispersal on the Gakkel Ridge, and identify any long-term trends in explosive eruption activity that may correspond with lava composition, hydrothermal venting and/or sea level fluctuations. The latter has been hotly debated in the literature, which posits that lower sea levels during glacial periods permit more extensive mantle decompression melting, hydrothermal venting and volcanism. Little research however has been done on the volcanic record along the mid-ocean ridge to test this hypothesis.​\n\nSan José2022-23 Rapid Response Program Year And Program : 2022-23 Grant Development Program ‎(5)\n\nBrain neuroplasticity adaptations in the speckled sanddab induced by low oxygen availability in the local estuary the Elkhorn Slough​\n\nDe MiguelZurineGrant Development Program2022-23\n\nEstuaries are highly productive and irreplaceable natural ecosystems that serve as nursery grounds for ecologically and commercially important fish species. The maintenance of this ecosystem is a highly dynamic process, regulated by multiple factors such as oxygen availability. Unfortunately, in the California estuaries, including the Elkhorn Slough, the frequency and intensity of hypoxic events, or low oxygen, has continued to increase over the years, and in some areas, fish live in constant hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia, is a type of environmental and physiological stressor that has been linked to impaired behavioral and physiological adaptations, increasing mortality and reproduction failure in fish. It is well known that the brain is a key organ that controls the behavioral and physiological adaptations to stressors. However, very little is known about how hypoxia affects the brain in wild species adapted to daily exposure of cycles of hypoxia in a natural environment. Here I propose to generate preliminary data to support the hypothesis that low oxygen levels can affect the brain structure and function of the speckled sanddab, a local fish found in the Elkhorn Slough. Preliminary data will strengthen my proposal and expand the number of grants that I can apply for. The overarching goal of my research is to elucidate the main brain mechanisms mediating the physiological and behavioral adaptations to hypoxia and to develop early health indicators associated with hypoxia. Future studies aim to map the molecular networks responding to hypoxia. The knowledge gained from these studies will 1) enhance our understanding of the response of fish to hypoxia, 2) help to inform the rational design of new mechanistic studies and 3) inform the state agencies who manage groundfish and nearshore stocks.​\n\nMonterey Bay2022-23 Grant Development Program\n\nBuilding a CSU network to monitor Pismo clam recovery​\n\nHauptAlisonRuttenbergBenZacherlDanielleGrant Development Program2022-23\n\nThe CSU system spans the coast of California and is primed to support cohesive monitoring of important coastal resources. We propose to lay the groundwork to create a CSU network to monitor the iconic and once-abundant Pismo clam. Our network will start with three CSU campuses: CSUMB, Cal Poly SLO, and CSUF. Understanding the status of populations of fishery species is challenging, yet critical to managing them effectively. These challenges are even greater for recreational fisheries that are often small-scale, diverse, and data poor. Diverse species and diffuse fishing activity make it difficult to enforce regulations, further complicating management. Rarer still are instances of rapid recovery of recreational fishery species, making critical to understand the status and potential drivers of the apparent rapid increase in Pismo clam populations along the Central Coast. The Ruttenberg lab at Cal Poly SLO initiated a monitoring program for Pismo clams in San Luis Obispo County, CA in 2015. This project will allow us to expand this monitoring program to Monterey Bay (PI Haupt) and Southern California (PI Zacherl). This work will lay the groundwork for a future larger grant through NSF BIO OCE, COPE, NOAA Sea Grant, or NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy to expand the spatial extent of the monitoring program and the scientific scope to include genetic components to examine genetic diversity, past bottlenecks, effective population size, dispersal patterns of Pismo clams, as well as community science and recreational fisheries management. PI Ruttenberg’s program is ongoing and has sufficient funding to continue. This grant will allow Haupt and Zacherl to purchase needed supplies and fund four students each to initiate a statewide monitoring program of Pismo clams. This project is an excellent project for CSU students because it can enga ge students at all levels from entry-level research experience to honors capstone projects.​\n\nMonterey BaySan Luis ObispoFullerton2022-23 Grant Development Program\n\nDynamics of ocean predator range shifts: species interactions, conflicts and recoveries​\n\nJorgensenSalvadorGrant Development Program2022-23\n\nIn response to ocean warming, marine species are shifting their geographic range poleward, resulting in novel occurrences and combinations of species. In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), where numerous taxa are experiencing range shifts, the thermal gradient is patchy rather than smooth. Preliminary data suggest shifted species, including predators, are concentrating in warm patches at the cold edge of their shifting range. Following the 2014 Eastern Pacific marine heat wave, my research has documented a climate-driven 280km northward range shift among juvenile white sharks, resulting in a novel concentration of the predators in the warmest corner of Monterey Bay. The resulting increase in white shark density into the southern sea otters¶ present-day core range threatens the recovery of this protected keystone mammal and demonstrates complex ecological interactions mediated by ocean warming that remain poorly understood. Building on tagging, remote sensing, and survey data generated from my recent work, this project will provide new insights into climate effects on marine communities and on the current and anticipated distribution of white sharks in relation to southern sea otter recovery. Specifically I will engage CSUMB graduate and undergraduate students in research to elucidate how regional warming and local oceanography drive the patchy distribution of juvenile white sharks in relation to sea otters and the kelp canopy that shelters them. The project will result in a better ecological understanding of climate driven species interactions and provide concrete recommendations for otter reintroduction efforts under consideration by partners at USFWS and other supporting NGOs.

This COAST GDP proposal seeks to collect preliminary data to 1) further hone key research questions that explore fundamental science and transformative concepts, 2) identify key collaborators with complimentary expertise, and 3) demonstrate likelihood of success as well as pitfalls in the experimental setup and analytical approaches for a future proposal to NSF that evaluates the fragmentation and degradation of marine debris in coastal urban enviro nments.​\n\nSan Diego2022-23 Grant Development Program Year And Program : 2021-22 State Science Information Needs Program ‎(3)\n\nAssessing current biological and physical status of California’s artificial reefs with comparisons​​ to natural reefs to improve compensatory mitigation outcomes​\n\nClaisseJeremyState Science Information Needs Program2021-22\n\nScientific Summary:\n\nDuring the past decade two large quarry rock artificial reef (AR) complexes have been built in California for compensatory mitigation and habitat restoration. Along with increased demand to use ARs for these purposes, moving forward AR habitat issues will continue to gain importance due to the introduction of new artificial habitat from offshore renewable energy structures and sea level rise adaptation infrastructure, and the imminent decommissioning of petroleum platforms and oil islands which may remove habitat. The CDFW is currently in the process of updating their AR management plan and would benefit from a systematic effort that evaluates the status and productivity of existing ARs constructed decades ago. The proposed project will directly address SSINP RFP Research Objective 2.1: Improving understanding of restoration practices to improve compensatory mitigation outcomes - Artificial reefs. The project will quantify physical attributes of existing ARs by collecting and analyzing geophysical data (i.e., bathymetry and acoustic backscatter) and assess their current status relative to historical descriptions. Biological metrics of ecological function (e.g., species richness, density, biomass, size structure, production, reproductive output) will also be quantified using the same comprehensive rocky reef SCUBA survey methods currently being used for statewide MPA monitoring. ARs will be selected for inclusion in the study in consultation with California state agency representatives based on total State and Federal funding available, initially focusing on ARs built from quarry rock, as it is the primary construction material likely to be used for future AR projects in California. Data analyses will compare community composition and ecological function metrics among artificial and representative natural reefs, and determine which habitat structure, environmental, and anthropogenic factors best explain patterns in biological metrics onAR modules. Results will then be applied to develop ecological function assessment metrics and design criteria for future AR projects.\n\nPlain Language Summary:\n\nThe California Natural Resources Agency is receiving increased calls for the construction of artificial reefs in our coastal ocean for habitat restoration and compensatory mitigation purposes to offset the negative impacts from other activities (e.g., fishing, dredging, coastal development, wastewater discharge). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is currently in the process of updating their artificial reef management plan and therefore it is an ideal time to understand how existing artificial reefs built decades ago to enhance fishing opportunities are doing. The proposed project will collect and analyze data from the existing artificial reefs built primarily from quarry rock to assess the current quality of the physical habitat structure including whether they have sunk into and been covered by sediment over the years. We will use the same methods currently used to survey the fish, invertebrates and algae on natural rocky reefs for the State’s Marine Protected Area assessment to determine how these artificial reefs are currently functioning biologically. Research results will be used to develop best practices for the design and construction of future projects that add artificial reef habitat along the California coast for habitat restoration, compensatory mitigation or potentially to protect coastlines from sea level rise.\n\nPomona2021-22 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nImproved Mitigation Frameworks: Guidance for Improved Restoration Efficacy Across ​​California’s Coastal Zone​​\n\nAndersonSeanState Science Information Needs Program2021-22\n\nScientific Summary:\n\nAlready common coastal stressors are growing in intensity and magnitude thanks to extant development pressures and the unfolding climate crisis. As we draw closer to exhausting remnant nearby candidate mitigation locations (i.e. potential coastal salt marsh restoration sites) and evermore chronic disturbance pushes systems toward alternative stable states (e.g. beachless coastlines at high tide), most official mitigation guidance remains exclusively bound to replicating historic conditions. As a consequence, when regulators are faced with increasingly common situations where in-kind and on-site mitigation are impractical or impossible, they are left rudderless and authorize out-of-kind or off-site mitigation haphazardly. We seek to rectify this management gap by providing well-articulated guidance for when and how to implement out-of-kind or off-site mitigation when in-kind or on-site are not realistic (or desired).\n\nAs seasoned professionals of numerous traditional working groups and science advisory panels, we recognize both the benefits best professional judgment can bring to difficult management challenges and the limitations inherent in most unstaffed, minimally funded efforts. We propose a series of phased working groups wherein the experience and insights of diverse experts will be augmented and tested with meta-analyses of literature and performance data compiled by our technical support staff.\n\nWorking group Phase 1 will produce general guidance applicable in all or most settings (community-independent) emphasizing ecological functioning as a common currency. Phase 2 will apply that guidance to discrete case studies as tailored recommendations for specific communities of acute restoration concern (kelp reefs, oyster beds, etc.). Phase 3 will apply our guidance to larger, regional-scale case studies (reduced fish productivity under marine heat waves, etc.). A final Phase 4 will synthesize all previous work. Our efforts will produce conceptual as well as situation-specific guidance to restoration professionals and coastal regulators.\n\nPlain Language Summary:\n\nCalifornia’s coastal ecosystems are being stressed and damaged at an increasing rate thanks to existing pressures and our unfolding climate crisis. While the ideal response to injury is to restore the identical habitat at the original location, that isn’t always possible (e.g. if sea level rise eliminates a sandy beach). In these circumstances we mitigate off-site (e.g. down coast) or with out-of-kind approaches (e.g. reducing predators to boost bird abundance). Unfortunately, most existing policies counsel on-\n\nsite and in-kind mitigation exclusively, leaving agencies rudderless when circumstances make preferred mitigation impossible. We propose to create guidance for how/when to conduct out-of-kind and off-site mitigation by convening a series of well-funded working groups with a range of experts. Funding will allow us to 1) bring voices traditionally not involved in such discussions together with seasoned practitioners and 2) undergird our efforts with extensive compilation and analyses of existing literature and of data compiled from historic and extant mitigations. Both of these dimensions have been historically absent from traditional, short-term, and minimally-resourced science advisory panels. In addition to general recommendations, we will also create specific guidance for communities of particular concern; artificial reefs, kelp beds, oyster beds, salt marshes, and sandy beaches.\n\nChannel Islands2021-22 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nUnderstanding production and attraction on artificial reefs to improve the science of mitigation​​​\n\nNickolsKerrySteeleMarkState Science Information Needs Program2021-22\n\nScientific Summary:\n\nArtificial reefs have emerged as a management tool to mitigate damage and loss of rocky reef habitat by land-based operations in California. Yet, there is substantial uncertainty about best practices for the design and construction of artificial reefs, as well as whether artificial reefs compensate for the activities they were designed to mitigate. A cause of this uncertainty is the difficulty in disentangling the degree to which artificial reefs lead to new production of marine organisms versus simply redistributing them by attracting them away from natural reefs. Our proposed research evaluates how attraction and production are influenced by 1) changes in size of the artificial reef, 2) life history traits, 3) proximity to nearby natural reefs, and 4) reef configuration. We will address these goals using an unprecedented 20+ year dataset – collected on the Wheeler North Artificial Reef and two reference natural reefs – of fish size and density, fish reproductive rates, and growth rates. We will analyze this dataset with a State Space Integral Projection Model to explicitly test hypotheses regarding the role of attraction and production on the artificial reef. The Wheeler North Artificial Reef has an extensive monitoring plan, however, the data collected are used to assess whether or not Wheeler North Reef is meeting mitigation standards for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and not to inform best practices for design and construction to maximize production of marine organisms. Leveraging this extensive data set will allow a rigorous examination of several questions that will directly inform management. Our project does not directly address one of the RFP research objectives, but is nonetheless strongly supported by two agencies (California Coastal Commission and California State Water Resources Control Board) that would use our results to develop policies for compensatory mitigation.\n\nPlain Language Summary:\n\nArtificial reefs are used to mitigate damage to natural rocky reefs in California. However, there are unanswered questions about how to best construct artificial reefs, as well as whether artificial reefs compensate for damage done to natural reefs. It is also difficult to tell if artificial reefs lead to new production of fish versus attracting them away from natural reefs. Our project evaluates how 1) changes in size of the artificial reef, 2) characteristics of fish species, 3) proximity to natural reefs, and 4) reef configuration influence attraction and production. We will use a 20+ year dataset – collected on the Wheeler North Artificial Reef and two nearby natural reefs – of fish size and density, fish reproductive rates, and growth rates, as well as a model of fish populations, to understand the roles of attraction and production on the artificial reef. This is a new use for the Wheeler North Reef data, which are currently only used to assess mitigation targets for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. Our proposed analysis leverages that rich dataset to answer important questions about artificial reef management, and our results will inform the future design and construction of reefs to maximize fish production.\n\nNorthridgeNorthridge2021-22 State Science Information Needs Program Year And Program : 2021-22 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program ‎(1)\n\nHighlighting Seaweed Expertise in CSU System Interdisciplinary Symposium​​​​​​\n\nKüblerJanetCuevas UribeRafaelShort Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program2021-22\n\nThe California State University System is home to deep expertise related to the rapidly expanding societal interest in seaweeds for human use and coastal ecosystem health. We propose to bring together CSU students, faculty and researchers working in the ecology, biology, oceanography, uses and aquaculture of seaweeds in California, at a 2-day event, co-located with a public facing event, on a CSU campus. The Symposium will include opportunities to present research and creative works in the form of live talks, posters and exhibits which will be open to the public attending the event. We will host a networking session, with invited guests from industry, coastal conservation organizations and agencies that interface with researchers. The goals of the Symposium are to raise the profile of seaweed research being done in CSU and to consciously foster collaborations between campuses on the topic of California seaweeds. To achieve those goals, we will provide the venue for presentations, opportunities to start conversation, assistance with travel to the Symposium from around the state and archiving of the live presentations online, all alongside the celebratory atmosphere of the California Seaweed Festival. The intellectual merit of this project lies in positioning CSU scientists at the forefront of state-level initiatives to develop macroalgal aquaculture along California’s working waterfront and to build capacities of resilience in both natural nearshore ecosystems and coastal socioeconomic systems: a trend emerging in other coastal states that could also benefit California. Highlighting Seaweed Expertise in the CSU System Interdisciplinary Symposium will take place October 7th and 8th, 2022 at the Bay Conference Center of the Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University. Organization of the Symposium is a collaboration of Janet Kübler, CSUN and Rafael Cuevas Uribe, California Polytechnic Humboldt.​\n\nNorthridgeHumboldt2021-22 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program Year And Program : 2021-22 Rapid Response Program ‎(7)\n\nMapping Biodegradation of Subsurface Oil in Huntington Beach Sands​​​​\n\nVozkaPetrRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nThe oil spill on October 1, 2021, off the coast of Huntington Beach, resulted in a temporary closure of the beach for clean-up efforts. On October 11, 2021, city officials and California State Parks announced the reopening of Huntington Beach “after water testing results came back with non-detectable amounts of oil-associated toxins in ocean water.” The beach was opened a mere ten days after the oil spill had been detected off the coastline. The decision to reopen was not met with the full support of the public, the majority concerned with the adverse health effects of oil spills. Research has shown that seawater and beach sands contaminated with oil spills pose an alarming threat to the coastal environment and human health. Assessing the chemical (oil including) contamination in oceans is a common practice. However, there has been limited research on sand beaches polluted with oil. Additionally, no official monitoring protocols or standards for oil spills are currently available. Therefore, the establishment of analytical methods for oil contamination in beach sands is required. In this project, we propose to (a) monitor the (bio)degradation of oil in sands from Huntington Beach over a year period, (b) develop fast analytical techniques to measure the sand toxicity levels, and (c) compare these levels to environmental standards and/or beaches not polluted with oil. Specifically, we will: (1) use comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) to monitor the concentrations of total hydrocarbon content and several targeted toxic chemicals (e.g., benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons); (2) utilize solid-phase microextraction techniques to measure low concentration levels; and (3) collect data from unpolluted beaches. If successful, this work will elucidate the (bio)degradation of subsurface oil and provide insight into the concentration levels of toxic compounds in Huntington Beach sands over one year period. Additionally, this work will address the following question: Was it safe to reopen Huntington Beach’s shoreline ten days after the oil spill incident?​\n\nLos Angeles2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nAssessing impacts of the Huntington Beach oil spill on benthic sediment decomposer communities in Talbert Marsh​​​\n\nDillonJesseWhitcraftChristineRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nAn oil pipeline off Huntington Beach was found to be leaking on October 2, 2021, releasing up to 3,111 barrels of crude oil into the coastal zone. Oil washed onto neighboring beaches and into nearby wetlands including the Huntington Beach Wetland (HBW) complex where it was observed in various concentrations on the sediment surface and in the water in all three marshes, especially Talbert Marsh. This oil spill will have major ecological impacts on marsh communities especially sediment communities where the oil is likely to persist for long periods of time. It is imperative that we rapidly assess both the short-term and long-term impacts on the marsh. Comparisons will be made to our prior COAST-funded data collected on plants, invertebrate and microbial communities in Talbert Marsh before the oil spill. These data, our relationship with the HBW Conservancy and Dr. Whitcraft’s connection to the oil spill response effort uniquely positions us to be able to quickly assess the impacts of the spill on this critical ecosystem. We will investigate the immediate impacts of oiling on Talbert Marsh using next generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and sorting/taxonomic keying, respectively, to assess the taxonomic diversity of bacteria and benthic invertebrates in the marsh using core samples already collected on 10/24. We will analyze cores taken across an oiling gradient as determined by visual inspection. We will compare these data with analyses of hydrocarbons from sediment cores taken in parallel and analyzed by Kinetics Laboratory. Finally, we propose to monitor the long-term community impacts of oiling on Talbert Marsh via quarterly sampling for 1 year to assess the potential long-term impacts or recovery of the marsh sediment communities. This will support two women scientists: a multi-​racial master’s student and Asian-American undergraduate.​\n\nLong BeachLong Beach2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nExceptional drought, coastal stream restoration and anadromous fish habitat​\n\nBiggsTrentRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nOverview: Populations of anadromous fish are threatened by both climate change, including exceptional drought, and direct human impacts on watersheds and channels, including logging, roads, removal of large woody debris, and large log dams created by logging waste. The objective of this project is to determine how the ongoing exceptional drought and local human activities, including logging and restoration, interact to impact coastal active stream channel networks and salmonid habitat in a coastal watershed (Indian Creek, Mendocino County). The project will fund travel for two students and the PI to the watershed in summer and early fall 2021 during a period of exceptional drought. Methods include a high-resolution ground survey of the stream channel to quantify aspects of the channel that are relevant for salmonid habitat, including wetted width and depth, total stream network extent, habitat complexity, pool frequency, and habitat complexity. Surveys will be completed in watersheds that have had either little or extensive restoration of roads and large woody debris. The data will be combined with existing models that predict salmonid habitat from field surveys to quantify salmonid habitat during the drought.\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project addresses COAST’s Programmatic Goal of “advancing knowledge of coastal watersheds and processes that affect them” by quantifying how climate extremes interact with watershed and channel disturbance to impact salmonid populations. The exceptional drought currently underway in Mendocino County provides a unique opportunity to quantify these interactions. The proposed work supports COAST Goal 3 (“Support graduate and undergraduate student research”) and Goal 8 (“Support the marine-related informational needs of government staff and elected officials”) by providing actionable information on salmonid habitat to key government agencies (NOAA). The team has provided the locations of salmonid populations at risk due to pool disconnection and desiccation in June 2021, which is being used to plan rescue efforts.​\n\nSan Diego2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nDocumenting the Geomorphic Impacts of the Removal of a Small Dam in the Coast Ranges​​\n\nGabetEmmanuelRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nRestoration of steelhead and Coho salmon populations is a driving force behind many regional dam removal projects. In addition to obstructing passage to upstream reaches, dams can constrict the supply of spawning gravel. However, these projects are often not accompanied by monitoring programs to examine whether they achieve their intended geomorphic goals, especially in the case of small dams which are easier and more likely to be removed. We propose to study the effects of the removal of a small dam on Mill Creek, near Davenport (CA), to document the downstream dispersal of sediment and to determine whether it leads to a relative enrichment in spawning gravel along the bed of the channel. Repeat topographic surveys of 25 channel cross-sections and co-located Wolman pebble counts will provide a rich data-set for examining spatial and temporal changes in bed elevation, bed complexity, and particle size distributions. The dam is scheduled to be removed in early September (2021), giving us time to collect an initial set of data establishing baseline conditions before the fall rainy season. This work will form the basis of an MS thesis, as well as a manuscript that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication. Moreover, although this award is only for 12 months, monitoring of this site by my research group will continue for many years.​\n\nSan José2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nOil Related Pollutants in Southern California Estuaries Impacted by the Huntington Beach Oil Spill​​​​​​\n\nHollandErikaWhitcraftChristineRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nThe introduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into the environment has increased due to the rise of human populations, general automobile combustion, and disasters such as oil spills. The unfortunate spill that occurred off the coast of Huntington Beach Ca, Oct. 2021, lead to approximately 25,000 gallons of oil spilled into nearby coastal environments. Numerous news sources documented oil on beaches and local wetland environments placing human and wildlife at risk. Initial efforts to assess potential risk focused on assessing PAH concentrations in water and fish species to protect human health. Research regarding the long-term impacts of the spill on effected estuaries and sessile organisms is needed to determine the full extent of the disaster. Oysters and other filter feeding organisms are at a particular risk because they can accumulate PAHs from the water column, from PAHs bound to suspended particulate matter, and PAHs found in sediment surrounding oyster habitat. Compared to fish species, bivalve species generally accumulate higher PAH concentrations after a spill and PAHs from oil spills have been connected to decreased oyster population density. Oysters act as ecosystem engineers that contribute to habitat formation for other species and have the potential to build structures aiding in shoreline stabilization. The overall goal of the current proposal is to assess the impact of the spill on nearby estuaries focusing on concentrations of PAHs found in oysters and sediment surrounding oyster habitat. We will compare PAH concentrations in sediment and/or oyster tissue collected from before and after the spill and in samples collected through Dec. 2022. This study will assess the contribution of the HB oil spill to oil related pollution in estuaries of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Complex and Upper Newport Bay to determine potential long-term risk presented to resident species namely bivalves and bivalve consuming vertebrates.\n\nLong BeachLong Beach2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nOil exposure to birds as a result of the Huntington Beach oil spill​​​​\n\nBonisoli AlquatiAndreaRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nExposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the main toxicants in oil, has a number ​of deleterious effects on the behavior, physiology and demography of birds. The Huntington Beach oil spill contaminated shores and coastal wetlands in Orange County, exposing to oil the birds that forage or nest in or near the contaminated sites. The lack of planned investigation into the toxicological consequences of such exposure is in stark contrast with accumulating evidence of the toxicological risks to breeding and migrating birds. The proposed research aims to fill this gap in knowledge by quantifying the concentrations of PAHs in the circulation of adult Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus), and in previously collected eggs of two seabird species, the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger) and Forster’s Tern (Sterna forsteri), with the aim to provide a baseline against which future measurements of egg PAHs concentrations can be compared.\n\nPomona2021-22 Rapid Response Program\n\nValuing public access to recreational and subsistence fishing along the berkeley waterfront\n\nAntinoriCamilleKingPhilRapid Response Program2021-22\n\nIn December 2021, Berkeley city council voted to move forward with a waterfront redevelopment proposal and is scheduled to make decisions over the next 6‐8 months that would solidify these planning decisions. The plans themselves have potential to impinge on public shoreline access for a broad cross section of the California population who walk, fish, engage in water sports or simply seek a relaxing​ outdoor setting. Despite expectations that park‐oriented activities would receive a full and consistent accounting explicitly in the design vision, the scope of these activities has been underrepresented in the current policy making process and work plans have tended to omit the capture of key information. Of all waterfront uses in Berkeley, recreational and subsistence fishing are the least represented, partly due to the individual nature of the activity and the disperse regions outside of Berkeley from which fishermen travel. An equity issue also exists as fishermen in this area strongly represent people of color and households with income below the San Francisco Bay Area median. This project fills that gap using sound social science methodology based on the \"travel cost method\" in environmental economics and generates both quantitative and qualitative information, including an estimated monetary value of public shoreline and pier fishing with comparisons across socioeconomic groups. Building on a project begun with seed money from the Lam Family College of Business, the PI will involve undergraduate and graduate students to make results available not only for peer‐reviewed article publication but also summary reports available by August 2022 to be useful for the policymaking process currently underway.​\n\nSan FranciscoSan Francisco2021-22 Rapid Response Program Year And Program : 2021-22 Grant Development Program ‎(5)\n\nTrophic transfer efficiency of PFAS in a coastal marine trophic web​​​​\n\nBonisoli AlquatiAndreaGrant Development Program2021-22\n\nExposure to per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals due to their environmental persistence, is a concern for environmental scientists and managers from academia, government, and non-governmental organizations. Yet, PFAS potential for bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs remains largely unknown. This complicates the assessment of their ecotoxicity and risk to human health. The proposed project will build towards the understanding of PFAS biomagnification from fish to the endangered California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni) in a coastal marine food web in Southern California.\n\nThe project has two objectives:\n\n1. Identify PFAS at greater concentrations and greater biomagnification risk from fish to the California least tern;\n\n2. Identify PFAS transferred at the highest concentrations from tern mothers to their eggs.\n\nThe PI and students from his lab will collect fish samples and California least tern blood and eggs. Concentration data in the biological samples will be produced for an extensive list of 28 PFAS with state-of-the-art analytical approaches, building credibility for future projects with more extensive sampling across individuals and species. The students will learn how to conduct sampling of fish and wildlife species, and how to interpret PFAS concentration data and their relationship to known toxicity reference values. The project will leverage a network of collaborations across institutions in California and beyond. It will also count on the established permits and the availability of historical data and samples from the same least tern colony.​ ​The preliminary data will serve as the basis for a grant proposal to be addressed to the Department of Defense. The proposed project will expand on the collected data by:\n\n(a) More explicitly examining biomagnification across a larger number of trophic levels, from zooplankton to fish to California least terns.\n\n(b) Assessing the toxicological effects of PFAS bioaccumulation and transfer in terms of hatching and fledging success.​\n\nPomona$20,0002021-22 Grant Development Program\n\nDetermining the adaptive value and molecular correlates of developmental plasticity in larvae of the Pacific sand dollar, Dendraster excentricus.​​\n\nPaceDouglasGrant Development Program2021-22\n\n​Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism for allowing organisms to respond to changes in their environment. Plasticity responses are especially important during development in marine invertebrate larval stages where they are passively floating in the water column and have no control over environmental conditions such as food level. During food-induced developmental plasticity, larvae of the Pacific sand dollar, Dendraster excentricus, respond by adaptively changing their morphology and physiology. Larvae receiving low amounts of food will grow longer arms and transiently possess higher efficiencies of metabolism and growth relative to larvae in a high food environment. However, there are still major knowledge gaps regarding the full adaptive value of this response pathway and the molecular mechanisms that support it. Aim 1 will assess the adaptive value of the plasticity response in temporally variable food environments (low-fed larvae switched to high-food conditions). Consequences of this food level variation will be assessed by studying changes in rates of development and physiological growth efficiency compared to constant low- and high-fed larvae. Aim 2 will assess molecular correlates of developmental plasticity. Differential gene expression will be assessed in low- and high-fed larvae using RNA-seq, with candidate genes being validated by RT-qPCR. Completion of this research will result in an integrative and compelling set of data that will be incorporated into a competitive NSF research proposal.\n\nLong Beach$20,0002021-22 Grant Development Program\n\nComparative Transcriptomics in the Intertidal Snail Tegula Genus to Examine Heat Stress Adaptation in the Era of Climate Change​​​\n\nGleasonLaniGrant Development Program2021-22\n\nWith temperatures rising globally, an increased understanding of the rate at which heat toleranceevolves is urgently needed. To fill this knowledge gap, new research must compare genetic differences between species, while also taking into account their evolutionary relationships, so genes contributing to adaptive thermal tolerance can be identified. The proposed research will use a comparative genomics approach in three Tegula intertidal snail species to provide additional insight into the rate of adaptive thermal tolerance evolution. Tegula is an ideal study system because known phylogenetic history for the genus enables the identification of adaptive genetic differences that are not simply due to shared ancestry. In southern California, Tegula gallina exhibits higher survival following heat stress compared to co-occurring species Tegula funebralis and Tegula eiseni. What is not fully understood is which specific genes contribute to survival differences, and whether the evolutionary rate of adaptation in this genus is likely to facilitate genetic changes that can “keep up” with a warming climate. This project will use RNA-sequencing to study species-specific responses to heat stress in three Tegula species. My students and I will:\n\n1) Identify genes whose high temperature expression response indicates they are adaptive (and contribute to survival in thermally stressful environments); and\n\n2) Identify genes related to thermal response undergoing positive selection (e.g. genes with putatively advantageous nucleotide mutations).\n\nThis research will inform future conservation planning. Specifically, results will help to determine whether species will be able to adapt to rising temperatures, or whether alternative processes such as acclimation, plasticity, and migration will be more important for survival. A future NSF Integrative Ecological Physiology proposal will expand this work to additional Tegula species to create a novel network model that can predict thermal response of ecologically important Tegula species in the field and thus provide insight regarding extinction risks.\n\nSacramento$20,0002021-22 Grant Development Program\n\nWhere are the Whales? Filling in Conservation Monitoring Gaps along California’s Central Coast with Bioacoustics​​​\n\nSchroth-GlanzMaddieLiwanagHeatherGrant Development Program2021-22\n\nUnderstanding and maintaining ocean ecosystems can be achieved through extensive monitoring efforts of marine life. Unfortunately, the ocean environment poses many challenges that limit our capabilities to perform such tasks. Generally, a useful way to study marine mammals is through passive bioacoustic techniques. While various individuals have made significant contributions to the monitoring efforts along the Central Coast of California, there is a substantial gap of understudied waters between the Channel Islands and Monterey Bay. We propose to contribute to the monitoring efforts of marine mammal species along the Central Coast of California by creating an acoustic monitoring station off the coast of San Luis Obispo County. This will allow us to:\n\n(1) identify what marine mammal species use this part of the coast,\n\n(2) quantify the presence and abundance of humpback and gray whales over time, and\n\n(3) identify the extent of anthropogenic noise in the region.\n\nCOAST funds will be utilized to acquire an essential piece of equipment needed for deployment of the SoundTrap600 HF hydrophone used for acoustic assessments. The Central Coast pilot data will be used in myriad ways. Data will be shared with other agencies involved in current monitoring efforts once long-term deployments are underway. Undergraduate students will help develop machine learning models for automatic detection via classroom projects to make future analyses easier and more attainable. Additionally, the hydrophone mooring and data acquired will help motivate the creation of a new bioacoustics course in the Marine Science Program. This project will create multiple research opportunities for undergraduate students at Cal Poly. Lastly, our intention with these pilot data is to showcase a need for more monitoring stations along the Central Coast of California to appeal to larger funding agencies. COAST funds will help support these efforts and more.\n\nSan Luis ObispoSan Luis Obispo$20,0002021-22 Grant Development Program\n\nAssessing Marine Mammal Bycatch in Chilean Artisanal Fisheries​​​​\n\nMateraJaimeHinesEllenGrant Development Program2021-22\n\nThis interdisciplinary research will assess marine mammal bycatch in the artisanal fisheries of Chile and its socioeconomic characteristics to better understand complex human-ecological interactions. Chile’s efforts towards MMPA compliance offers an important opportunity for meaningful research into marine mammal conservation and bycatch mitigation that considers both social and ecological aspects to promote inclusive and effective management programs. This is critical in areas with high overlap of marine mammals and fisheries, and where little information exists on the extent of bycatch and livelihoods, as is the case of many artisanal fisheries worldwide. While Chile has made strides towards understanding the extent of bycatch from the commercial fisheries, little data exists on bycatch from the artisanal fishing sector, which employs over 90,000 fishers along its Pacific coastline, creating a mosaic of diverse social, institutional, and ecological attributes that complicate collaborative resource management. Research will take place in San Antonio, central coast of Chile, where bycatch of threatened and endangered marine mammal species, including the Chilean Dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia) and Burmeister ́s porpoises (Phocoena spinipinnis), have been documented. We will collect socioeconomic and ecological data using structured and semistructured interviews and focus groups with independent and organized artisanal fishers, and officials in charge of ensuring compliance with MMPA and other fishery regulations. Interviews will focus on estimating marine mammal bycatch from the artisanal fishery, understanding its socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, discerning fisher’s attitudes towards marine mammals, and capturing perceptions about marine conservation policies. Importantly, we will engage stakeholders to examine ways to mitigate negative human-marine mammal interactions that considers both social and environmental criteria. Data gathered by this proposed research project will support an NSF Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) proposal to be submitted November 2022 to assess country-wide spatial and temporal marine mammal bycatch risk for fisheries management and conservation planning.\n\nChannel IslandsSan Francisco$19,9962021-22 Grant Development Program Year And Program : 2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program ‎(9)\n\nMicro and nanoplastic identification in aqueous samples using Nano-IR​​​​​​\n\nDominguezGerardoState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nWe propose to evaluate and develop sample handling, particle identification, and protocols for using NanoIR imaging to accurately and efficiently count and classify micro- and nano-plastic particles found in aqueous samples. While the main focus will be on nanoplastics, our work may also enable rapid microplastic particle identification and polymer classification. To do this, we proposed to use advanced analytical instrumentation that the PI co-developed as a postdoctoral fellow and that has been applied successfully to map out the composition of natural samples including cometary dust grains and meteorites. We will validate these methods using nanoplastic standards and we will work with collaborators to apply the techniques to examining the nano and micro-plastic content of aqueous field samples. This development, if successful, promises to significantly expand our knowledge and understanding of the sources and sinks of micro- and nano-plastic particles in the environment.\n\n​\n\nSan Marcos2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nAssessing fate and toxicity of microplastics under coastal environment​ conditions​​​\n\nHohEunhaMladenovNatalieSantKarilynState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\n​The research goals of the proposed project are to 1) evaluate the dissolution of chemicals from microfibers and tire wear particles in seawater under sunlight-exposed and dark conditions, 2) elucidate mechanisms of aquatic toxicity produced by leaching chemicals from the new and aged microplastics, and 3) identify chemicals responsible for toxicity. Experimental setups will be conducted to leach microfibers and tire wear particles at environmentally ​​relevant concentrations. Irradiation experiments will be conducted to stimate photodegradation rates of leached compounds. Non-targeted analysis will be a primary tool in this study and will provide unprecedented detection of previously unknown chemicals associated with microfibers and tire wear particles. Zebrafish embryotoxicity studies will be performed using the leachates, and gene expression will be analyzed to evaluate mechanisms of toxicity.\n\nPrevious toxicological studies have focused largely on non-fiber and non-rubber microplastics, such as microbeads and broken fragments of larger plastics, and most studies describe effects due to the particles themselves rather than the leached constituents. Considering the far greater number of microfibers (from textiles and tire wear) found in California’s coastal waters, this study focuses on these two categories of microplastics. Also, recent studies have shown that 23,600 metric tons of dissolved organic carbon are leaching from marine plastics annually, and these dissolved compounds have unknown effects on marine organisms. Most ecotoxicology studies have focused on gross outcomes such as mortality, but the overall mechanisms of toxicity remain poorly characterized.\n\nThe work proposed here is relevant to the stated science needs, primarily the needs expressed under Research Objective #2 of the RFP, Ecotoxicology. This interdisciplinary study will address a critical gap in the science of microplastics, specifically the need for a more mechanistic understanding of the toxicity of leached chemical constituents from textile-derived and tire-derived microplastics.\n\nSan DiegoSan DiegoSan Diego2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\n​Impact of Sea-Level Rise on Groundwater Pollution Vulnerability in Shallow Coastal Aquifers\n\nHagedornBenjaminBecker MattBramDanielle State Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nScientific Summary:​\n\nThe impact of rising sea levels on surface flooding (coastal inundation) has been thoroughly explored for low-lying metropolitan areas. Less understood, however, is the impact that rising sea levels will have on groundwater levels and quality. Fresh groundwater essentially floats atop seawater in coastal aquifers so sea-level rise (SLR) will bring rising groundwater that may potentially mobilize contaminants from the unsaturated zone. In industrial areas, for example, hazardous waste tanks, landfills, and impoundments are sited where depth to groundwater is sufficiently large to mitigate environmental releases. Many of these sites will need to be reevaluated by Water Boards and other regulators as groundwater levels rise. Furthermore, there is a lack of information and data on the potential effect of SLR on groundwater resources in disadvantaged communities (DACs). We will evaluate potential impacts using various Geographic Information System (GIS) methodologies, as well as groundwater flow and chemical transport models that have been applied in other regional studies.\n\nTo identify areas of concern, we propose to utilize (1) digital elevation model based topographic analysis, (2) available groundwater level databases, (3) hazardous waste and environmental release spatial datasets, (4) grid-free groundwater models, (5) reactive transport models of groundwater quality, and (6) demographic and socio-economic spatial datasets to identify disadvantaged communities. GIS analyses will be run on all low-lying coastal regions of California, and detailed studies will be conducted on two representative low-lying coastal communities. The project will team experts in GIS, demography, physical hydrology, and groundwater chemistry to identify potential areas of concern both for rising groundwater in general and more specifically, for vulnerable disadvantaged populations. These areas will be ranked according to severity and immediacy as a basis for regulators to prioritize management and planning efforts in the face of rising sea levels.\n\nPlain Language Summary:\n\nLack of safe and reliable drinking water is an issue that disproportionately affects residents of California's coastal communities due to increasing population and rising sea levels. A rising groundwater table caused by widespread sea level rise (SLR) can have serious impacts on infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and human health. In this project, we will explore the scope of this potential impact under multiple SLR scenarios. Specifically, we will focus on how rising groundwater might impact sites with contaminated soils and hazardous waste storage and disposal sites. Environmentally impacted sites may experience contamination release as soil moisture rises and groundwater seeps into subsurface tanks and impoundments. We will explore the entire low-lying coast of California, then focus on two selected coastal groundwater basins to evaluate potential impacts. Both the broad and focused studies will investigate how potential contamination releases might disproportionately impact disadvantaged communities.\n\nLong BeachLong BeachNorthridge2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\n​Sustaining Beaches and Social Equity under Higher Sea Levels: An interdisciplinary case study of the Santa Barbara Littoral Cell\n\nPatschKikiKingPhilipReinemanDanRobertsNinaState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nScientific Summary​:​\n\n​This project will assess how marginalized communities’ access to California’s shoreline will be impacted by sea level rise and develop guidelines for how to best manage beaches currently and under higher sea levels. Specifically, we will collect and analyze data related to coastal access equity and environmental justice by measuring both the current demand through beach intercept surveys and observational data collection as well as the latent demand for beaches with a regional survey of households, informed by our beach intercept survey and through direct engagement utilizing focus group interviews in the counties of interest, to explore the factors that enable and inhibit beach access and use. These data will address present-day inequities in the accessibility for different demographic groups and underserved communities in the study area. Our social scientific data will be combined with an existing database on beach geomorphology and ecology to generate a beach access model which incorporates future changes in beach and back-beach profiles as well as access inequities/barriers.\n\nWe will provide a tool for collecting, analyzing, and decision-making to support coastal decision makers, local managers, engaged stakeholders, and the general public to facilitate access to the coast by all Californians today and tomorrow.\n\nPlain Language Summary:\n\n​California’s beaches are threatened by sea level rise; Iconic beaches will disappear by 2100—losses whose impacts will not be distributed evenly among California’s diverse population. Sustaining beaches and equitable access requires coordinated efforts by stakeholders combined with knowledge of beach resilience as well as how beach management affects access, use, environmental justice, and economic value.\n\nThis project focuses on the economic and environmental justice issues related to access, incorporating projected changes in beach size and availability. Our analysis will fold into a Beach Sustainability Assessment (BSA) including social science, ecology, and the physical changes projected for beaches. This assessment will be combined with estimates based on the best available data and methods, of beach value, visitation, and accessibility along with the barriers that reduce them and the people and communities who experience those barriers. From these, we can measure current inequities and barriers to beach access, identify beach access points threatened by sea level rise, and develop guidelines for how to best manage beaches in the present and under higher sea levels so they can be enjoyed by all different people and communities while integrating the importance of the beach with the frameworks of the economy, ecology, and morphology.\n\nChannel IslandsSan FranciscoChannel IslandsSan Francisco2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\n​Development of Cost-effective Metrics for Monitoring Living Shorelines\n\nZacherlDanielleCarlinJosephMillerLukeWhitcraftChristineState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\n​Scientific Summary:\n\nSea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change threatens California shorelines because of restricted opportunities for upslope migration and due to shoreline erosion, putting our coastal habitats at risk. California’s resource managers are increasingly pursuing “living shoreline” initiatives that use natural habitats to promote shoreline resiliency.\n\nIn direct alignment with SSINP SLR Research Objective 3.1, our team of investigators from CSU Long Beach, CSU Fullerton, San Diego State University, and OC Coastkeeper seeks to leverage a well-established, ongoing restoration effort in Newport Bay, Newport Beach by substantially expanding the monitoring scope and, importantly, extending the timeline to determine the extent to which oyster and eelgrass beds can act as living shorelines that promote shoreline resiliency while providing a suite of ecological benefits beyond the targeted organisms, including habitat creation and trophic support. We propose a robust, long-term monitoring framework that quantifies more than 45 physical and biological metrics; our team will apply a statistical approach to evaluate which of the metrics we measure are the most cost-effective and accurate indicators of functional outcomes, and which best predict the restoration trajectory of oyster and eelgrass beds. We will thus contribute to the development of monitoring protocols that can be applied inexpensively and can be used to predict a broad array of success outcomes (SSINP SLR Research Objective 3.1). Results will be shared with government agencies and organizations (e.g., Southern California Wetlands Recovery Project, Orange County MPA Collaborative, Native Olympia Oyster Collaborative) and the public, promoting living shorelines to address sea level rise. Because CSULB, CSUF, and SDSU are Hispanic-Serving Institutions, where > 50% of students are low-income, first-generation college students, our project will benefit disadvantaged CA communities via education and workforce development through direct involvement of at least seven paid undergraduate and M.S. students.​​\n\n​Plain Language Summary:\n\nSea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change may cause habitat loss and shoreline erosion along the California coastline. California’s resource managers are seeking to understand whether native habitat restoration could address SLR by preventing shoreline erosion while also providing ecological benefits. Ideally, monitoring protocols for such projects should be low-cost and efficient so that measuring a few simple factors could predict a broad array of restoration outcomes. Investigators from CSU Long Beach, CSU Fullerton, San Diego State University, and OC Coastkeeper will leverage an ongoing oyster and eelgrass restoration effort in Newport Bay, Newport Beach by expanding the scope and duration of monitoring to determine how effectively these habitats can promote shoreline resiliency while providing additional ecological benefits, including habitat creation and food chain support. We will evaluate which of over 45 measured physical and biological factors are the most cost-effective and accurate indicators of long-term restoration success, contributing to the development of less costly and simplified monitoring protocols. Because CSULB, CSUF, and SDSU are Hispanic-Serving Institutions, where > 50% of students are low-income, first-generation college students, our project will benefit disadvantaged CA communities via education and workforce development through involvement of multiple paid students.​\n\nFullertonFullertonSan DiegoLong Beach2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nStrengthening sustainability in an acidified ocean: does the co-culture of seaweeds and shellfish improve shell integrity in farmed red abalone? (Match for 2021 California Sea Grant New Faculty Award)​​​​\n\ndeVriesMayaGrahamMichaelHamiltonScottState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nThe central objective of the proposed project is to understand how the co-culturing of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and red seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis) may reduce stress and improve shell integrity, including calcification patterns and biomechanical properties, in abalone under ocean acidification (OA) conditions. Abalone appear to be extremely vulnerable to OA, exhibiting shell damage and reduced growth under high pCO2 conditions. Investigating the central objective will help improve the viability of abalone aquaculture by revealing how co-culture might mitigate stress and reduce shell damage that can decrease the economic value of abalone. To address this objective, the proposed project will investigate three primary questions and corresponding hypotheses:\n\nQ1. How do the material and biomechanical properties of abalone shell respond to OA conditions?\n\nHypothesis: Abalone shells will be thinner, weaker, less calcified, and show signs of increased corrosion under OA conditions.\n\nQ2. How do these material and mechanical responses correlate with stress responses in abalone?\n\nHypothesis: Changes in material and mechanical properties of abalone shells will correlate with increased physiological stress under OA conditions.\n\nQ3. Does the co-culture of abalone and seaweeds ameliorate negative physiological and biomechanical responses to OA in red abalone?\n\nHypothesis: The co-culture of abalone and seaweeds will significantly decrease physiological stress in abalone, while yielding stronger, more calcified shells that exhibit less dissolution.\n\nSan JoséSan JoséSan José2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nQuantifying the production rate of bromoform (CHBr3) from cultured Asparagopsis (Match for 2021 California Sea Grant New Faculty Award)\n\nGrandMaximeGardnerLukeState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to explore the current and potential future impact of seaweed aquaculture in California on the natural flux of volatile bromocarbon gases​​ to the atmosphere. Our objectives consist of measuring the production of bromoform and dibromomethane by 7 different local species of seaweed, with a particular focus on species that may be mass produced to generate feed additives to reduce methane emissions from ruminant livestock. We also seek to reduce the uncertainty associated with traditional measurement techniques through the development of a novel tank incubation protocol mimicking long-line seaweed cultivation practices at the Moss Landing Marine Labs Aquaculture Facility and by quantifying diurnal variations in the production rates of brominated gases by seaweeds.​​​\n\nSan JoséSan José2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nStudy of the biology of night smelt (Spirinchus starksi) in Humboldt and Del Norte counties (Match for 2021 California Sea Grant New Faculty Award)​​​\n\n​\n\nMarin JarrinJoseState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nDespite the commercial, ecological and cultural importance of night smelt, very little is know about its biology or ecology. The objectives of this project would be to (1) identify and describe the as yet unknown larvae of night smelt, using genetic barcoding, and (2) study the status of the adult population in northern California by aging the otoliths of adult night smelt extracted in 2014, collecting additional adult smelt at the same locations during similar months in 2021, and compare Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE), length, age, weight, and sex ratios between the two years. Comparing these two years would allow us to study how the population has changed in the last 7 years, and better understand the potential impacts of the 2015 marine heat wave, referred to as ‘the blob’, and 2016 El Niño, both of which are phenomena that are expected to be strengthened and made more common by climate change.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives we will collaborate with Katherine Meyer of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife who was Principal Investigator of the 2014 study, James Ray (“key personnel”) of California Department of Fish and Wildlife in the Eureka office, Dr. Eric Bjorkstedt, researcher with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, based at HSU, Megan Van Pelt, executive director of the Tribal Marine Stewards Network and Sherri Norris, executive director of the California Indian Environmental Alliance. Ms. Van Pelt and Ms. Norris will serve as liaisons between project participants and their networks, which includes the Tolowa Dee-ni’ Nation, Trinidad Rancheria, Wiyot Tribe, and Resighini Rancheria, to encourage knowledge exchange and assist with development of their fisheries management capacity.​\n\nHumboldt2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program\n\nFrameworks for Managing the Known Risk of Sea Level Rise Inundation of Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant’s Spent Nuclear Fuel Site (Match for 2021 California Sea Grant New Faculty Award)​​​\n\n​\n\nMarlowJenniferState Science Information Needs Program2020-21\n\nThis project will address risk from sea level rise vulnerability to a spent nuclear fuel site located on a bluff 44 feet above Humboldt Bay. One goal of the research is to address the critical need for information to enhance public understanding of the site’s vulnerability to sea level rise and the integrity of the spent fuel casks over time. Another goal is to assess whether participatory research can enhance future actions to mitigate for such risk by making decision making more inclusive of regional interests. The research will gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of participatory scenario planning methods for embracing the critical uncertainties about the site’s future, and for helping critical stakeholders evaluate pathways for mitigating risk and avoiding unintended consequences. The research will also apply conflict resolution frameworks in order to identify common pathways for addressing vulnerability, given the highly controversial nature of the issue. The research aims for its outcomes to be shaped by direct participation from critical stakeholders seeking to influence decision making about future protections for the site. These outcomes will be shared through public outreach and academic publications targeted at policy makers developing standards for nuclear waste management that take sea level rise–risk into account.​​\n\nHumboldt2020-21 State Science Information Needs Program Year And Program : 2020-21 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program ‎(1)\n\nCSU Openscapes C​hampions Mentorship Program​​\n\nLoganCherylNickolsKerrySilbigerNyssaShort Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program2020-21\n\nThe open science movement broadly states that science should be conducted in an open,\n\ntransparent, and reproducible manner where all research components (data, physical samples,\n\ncode/software, and publications) are open and accessible to the public. Open science increases\n\nthe reliability and reproducibility of research, the speed of doing science, and, for individual\n\nscientists, can also provide reputational gains and increased chances of publication. Although\n\nmany CSU-COAST faculty are eager to foster open science practices in their research labs, lack\n\nof training, time, and support can hinder implementation. This is especially true for faculty\n\nconducting research at undergraduate focused institutions where they cannot rely on postdocs or\n\nPhD students to lead such efforts. Openscapes Champions is a mentorship program for research\n\ngroups with the aim of creating a positive open culture in science, enabling scientists to “do\n\nbetter science in less time”. The program has been implemented in R1 research labs, but has yet\n\nto be implemented in primarily undergraduate institutions. In this proposal, the PIs will work\n\nwith Openscapes Director, Julia Lowndes, to pilot the Openscapes mentorship program for the\n\nfirst time in the CSU system, across 5 CSU-COAST research lab groups. The pilot program will\n\nbe implemented in four virtual sessions over two months between May-June 2021. Centered\n\naround collaborative coding and open science, Openscapes will meet CSU-COAST research\n\nstudents where they are and help develop habits and mindsets to make data workflows and team\n\nculture more efficient and resilient. Our goal is to empower young scientists by mentoring them\n\nto become champions for open practices, supporting them to improve open practices within their\n\nlabs and campuses.\n\nMonterey BayNorthridgeNorthridge2020-21 Short Course, Workshop and Symposium Funding Program Year And Program : 2020-21 Rapid Response Program ‎(4)\n\n​Persistence of SARS Coronavirus-2 in natural waters\n\nMladenovNatalieVerbylaMatthewRapid Response Program2020-21\n\nRecent findings of the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease COVID-19, in untreated wastewater have important implications for coastal water quality and public health. Research by our groups has shown that the major source of pathogenic ​ microorganisms to the San Diego River and its tributaries is untreated wastewater, derived most likely from sewer exfiltration or sanitary sewer overflows. Wastewater also can be introduced directly into coastal zones from ocean sewage outfalls. Studies have shown that different coronaviruses can persist on surfaces and in wastewater for days. Yet, much still remains to be understood about how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the water matrix after its introduction from different wastewater inputs. The persistence of the virus in water may be influenced by icroorganisms and chemical constituents in the water column as well as sunlight and other environmental factors. This study will use a combination of experimental and analytical techniques to measure concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater directly and in natural waters (riverine and seawater) spiked with 20% wastewater in simulated sunlight and dark conditions over time. Wastewater used for this study will be collected from the influent of two wastewater treatment facilities in San Diego County, receiving and treating wastewater from more than 2.2 million residents. This research will advance knowledge of the presence of the virus in wastewater influent and of its degradation due to photochemical processes. A graduate student will be mentored by PIs Mladenov and Verbyla to conduct experimental work and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in water samples. Preliminary data from this study will inform future research directions and be conveyed to decision makers and local communities so that the risks associated with wastewater spills and other inputs to surface waters are better understood.​​\n\nSan DiegoSan Diego2020-21 Rapid Response Program\n\n​Summer sandy beach monitoring: The effects of shelter-in-place on Southern California beaches\n\nPatschKikiAndersonSeanRapid Response Program2020-21\n\n​Goal : Collect highly perishable beach condition data in the wake of the unprecedented months of coronavirus-driven beach closures.\n\nOur Sandy Beach Research Group has been monitoring and sampling southern California beaches to refine our Beach Sustainability Assessment (BSA) index for the past seven years. Just as we are finalizing and publishing this new tool for coastal managers, the most significant reduction in human visitation to beaches in California’s modern history began with Covid-19-driven beach closures across the state. Simultaneously, our annual, early-summer monitoring of 40+ beaches has been made nearly impossible given our student technicians have been forced to return home, often dispersing across the state. Additionally, our current campus and CSU policy of restricting access to laboratories and state-owned research equipment complicates our ability to map our sites with our drone fleet. At this time, when the utility and sensitivity of our nascent BSA index can be best demonstrated, our ability to collect field data is extremely reduced.\n\nWe therefore seek funding to support the additional travel costs for the early summer season imposed on our field personnel by homestay and campus closures. This funding would primarily support students and licensed drone pilots who must now travel much greater distances to get to our various beach sites across Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties. All field visits would be made by a single or limited (2) number of technicians at any given beach, following our newly-crafted Coronavirus safety protocols. All sandy and invertebrate samples will be retained by technicians until university laboratories reopen.\n\nSecuring this funding would assure collection of this highly perishable data on extant beach conditions, potentially unique in our lifetimes.\n\nChannel IslandsChannel Islands2020-21 Rapid Response Program\n\n​Drone-based monitoring of a potential eelgrass recovery following an estuary-wide collapse in a major California estuary\n\nWalterRyanFrickerAndrewRapid Response Program2020-21\n\n​In shallow coastal and estuarine habitats, seagrass meadows are declining at an alarming rate, resulting in the loss of important ecosystem services. Morro Bay, an estuary in central California, historically supported one of the state’s largest eelgrass (Zostera marina) populations. However, from 2007 to 2017, intertidal eelgrass in Morro Bay underwent an unprecedented collapse, declining from 139.2 ha (344 acres) in 2007 to 5.4 ha (13 acres) in 2017. The estuary-wide loss of eelgrass resulted in drastic changes, ranging from a shift in fish species composition and loss of habitat specialists to widespread erosion in places that previously supported eelgrass. As part of a funded project that recently ended, drone-based surveys from December 2017 to December 2019 showed signs of partial recovery with total eelgrass acreage going from 5.4 ha (13.3 acres) to 14.9 ha (36.7 acres). This, combined with recent successful small-scale restoration efforts led by the Morro Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP), suggests that Morro Bay may be going through another major period of transition and possible reemergence of the major biogenic habitat. It is critical to continue to track eelgrass acreage during this time with important ramifications for the physical, biological, and chemical environment. We are requesting funding to support a high-resolution drone-based survey using a new multispectral camera at the end of 2020 during this critical eelgrass transition period. This project will strengthen collaborations among researchers at Cal Poly and other organizations, support an undergraduate student, and provide community partners (MBNEP) and regulatory agencies with results to inform future restoration and adaptive management approaches. Moreover, the data generated from this project will likely be included in future publications on the status of eelgrass in Morro Bay, as well as future research efforts assessing drone-based monitoring of eelgrass health and automated classification techniques.\n\nSan Luis ObispoSan Luis Obispo2020-21 Rapid Response Program\n\n​Fire Impacts on Steelhead Spawning Gravel in the Carmel River​\n\nSmithDougRapid Response Program2020-21\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe sources, transport and sinks of salmonid spawning gravel in Mediterranean climate watersheds are poorly understood. Past work on the Carmel River in central California suggests that virtually no new gravel enters the streams without catastrophic, fire-mediated slope failure. There is a short window of opportunity to fully document post-fire slope failure and the impacts on steelhead spawning gravel in winter 2020/2021. The urgency stems from the need to capture pre-rain baseline data and to then capture slope-failure events following significant rain events.\n\nWe propose to observe (small drone video) and describe the slope failure processes that are likely to occur on specific burned slopes in Winter 2020-21, directly adjacent to the Carmel River channel. We will also describe the degree to which new sediment has entered the river through reconnaissance hikes along the toe of slope. After the winter flows have ebbed, we will quantify the change in spawning gravel conditions in the river channel near the slopes via a BACI statistical comparison with a long-term (7 year) data set collected using identical methods at the same benchmarked locations in the river.\n\nIt is unclear why the California South-Central Coast Steelhead Distinct Population Segment has been in decline since 1996. Paucity of spawning-sized gravel downstream of San Clemente Dam\n\nwas identified as one potential limiting factor in that watershed. A long-term study of spawning gravel was initiated in 2013 in anticipation of the San Clemente Dam removal in 2015. That\n\nstudy collected 100 bed particle-size counts from 66 benchmarked transects spanning a range of morphological units annually to 2020. The sites were selected to afford a robust BACI analysis to determine the effect of dam removal. Two of those sites, located adjacent to our study slopes never accumulated enough spawning gravel to cover the boulders and large cobbles that are too never accumulated enough spawning gravel to cover the boulders and large cobbles that are too coarse for redds. Our study will track how those sites respond to fire-driven catastrophic input of new sediment. Future work will track the evolution of any significant sediment inputs through time and space as the sediment slug moves past our other monitoring sites.\n\nMonterey Bay$50002020-21 Rapid Response Program Year And Program : 2020-21 Grant Development Program ‎(7)\n\n​ ​Mechanistic underpinnings of Galápagos coral thermal tolerance\n\nLoganCherylGrant Development Program2020-21\n\n​​​\n\n​Coral reef ecosystems provide >$30 billion USD​ in food security, coastal protection, and tourism each year. Global warming is threatening the future of corals though increasing rates of coral ​bleaching. Bleaching occurs when corals expel the colorful photosynthetic algae that provide them food when water temperature gets too warm. Regions like the Galápagos islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, with an extended history of bleaching, provide a potential ‘early warning’ case study for understanding the long-term effects of repeat bleaching. Unexpectedly, these surviving Galápagos corals may be uniquely thermally resistant to both heat and cold temperatures. In this proposal, we will examine the mechanistic underpinnings of coral thermal tolerance at six representative sites across the Galápagos archipelago. We will leverage in situ temperature tolerance data and tissue samples collected during PI Logan’s sabbatical to the Galápagos in 2019 to investigate genomic mechanisms of measured heat- and cold- tolerance phenotypes. Identification of thermally “tough” corals in this unique region may help in reseeding other locations for long-term persistence of corals in the face of a changing climate. Research will support an MS thesis and undergraduate Honors capstone project at CSUMB. Findings will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature and presented at the International Coral Reef Symposium and the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology annual meeting. Data collected will be also used to develop an NSF-IOS proposal to extend this work to other reef locations within the Eastern Tropical Pacific.\n\nMonterey Bay$20,0002020-21 Grant Development Program\n\n​Ocean Acidification and Light as Environmental Drivers of Domoic Acid Toxicity in Coastal and Estuarine Ecosystems of California\n\nCochlanWilliamGrant Development Program2020-21\n\n​\n\nThe neurotoxic amino acid, domoic acid (DA) is produced by multiple species of the Pseudo-nitzschia diatom genus, and poses a significant health threat to marine mammals, seabirds, and humans via transfer of this toxin through the marine food web. Exposure in humans causes aneurotoxic illness known as amnesic shellfish poisoning. Regular monitoring of DA concentrations in edible shellfish tissues has been an effective reactive strategy to protect human consumers from acute exposure, but understanding the environmental factors that contribute to the accelerated growth and enhanced toxicity of Pseudo-nitzschia cells will greatly improve\n\npredictive forecasting models and provide a proactive means to minimize the toxic risk to coastal ecosystems. At present there are no reliable measures of the drivers of DA production and its\n\naccumulation by natural Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in the coastal waters of California or its adjacent estuarine regions such as San Francisco Bay (SF Bay) – a system which to date has escaped DA toxic events despite supporting significant populations of Pseudo-nitzschia. Here we propose to use unialgal laboratory cultures to examine the effects of increasing light availability and declining pH levels by using factorial experiments of increasing complexity to understand the impact of these two environmental factors, and their interactions on cellular growth and production of DA by P. australis and P. multiseries – the two most problematic Pseudo-nitzschia species in California coastal waters and the dominant Pseudo-nitzschia species in California’s largest estuary – SF Bay. The insights from this study will include an understanding of which\n\nenvironmental parameters are valuable predictors of potential DA exposure in coastal ecosystems, and can be used to improve existing forecasting models of Pseudo-nitzschia growth\n\nand toxicity, and thus more effectively characterize the degree of risk of DA toxicity to marine ecosystems, crucial commercial, recreational and subsistence fisheries, and ultimately human\n\nhealth.\n\nSan Francisco$20,0002020-21 Grant Development Program\n\n​Strengthening shellfish in an acidified ocean: does co-culture with seaweeds improve shell integrity in farmed abalone and oysters?\n\ndeVriesMayaGrant Development Program2020-21\n\n​\n\nShellfish aquaculture has become an important contributor to seafood markets on the U.S. West Coast, with the Pacific oyster industry being the largest in the region. Red abalone and Olympia\n\noysters are native to the West Coast and have a long tradition of harvest. However, wild populations of these native species are suffering, and aquaculture is now the main means of their\n\nproduction and restoration. Despite the importance of shellfish aquaculture to seafood markets and restoration efforts, there is widespread concern that ocean acidification (OA) threatens future\n\naquaculture operations. Both oysters and abalone have been shown to be extremely vulnerable to OA, especially as larvae and juveniles, and they exhibit shell damage and reduced growth under OA conditions. Co-culturing shellfish with seaweeds is a proposed method for reducing the negative impacts of OA on shellfish because of the buffering capacity of seaweeds to raise seawater pH. My collaborators at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories have shown that growing red seaweed dulse together with abalone buffers the effects of OA and improves abalone growth. The logical next steps are to 1) integrate oyster aquaculture into this co-culture system, and 2) determine whether the presence of seaweeds in OA conditions will yield abalone and oysters with shells that are stronger and more heavily calcified. To address these objectives, I will apply novel engineering technologies to test the material and mechanical properties of shells in the presence and absence of seaweeds. Given that both their meat and shell have commercial value, addressing these goals will help improve the viability of oyster and abalone aquaculture by making the whole animal more resilient to OA conditions. Ultimately, determining whether\n\nshellfish/seaweed co-culture has positive effects on shell structure could help aquaculture expand to meet the demand for these globally consumed shellfish in and beyond California.​\n\nSan José$20,0002020-21 Grant Development Program\n\n​Geochemistry and Environmental Impacts of Oil Seeps in Coastal Watersheds\n\nHauswirthScottGanguliPriyaGrant Development Program2020-21\n\nWe propose to investigate the impact of natural oil seeps and improperly sealed oil wells on the geochemistry and water quality of streams within two coastal watersheds in Southern California. The introduction of oil to aquatic systems presents several hazards. Organic components of oils, such as carcinogenic and mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are harmful to humans and aquatic organisms and can degrade ecosystem functions. Less obvious is the potential for direct and indirect increases in the concentrations and transport of heavy metals. Oil contains elevated concentrations of several toxic metals (e.g., vanadium, nickel, lead, and mercury), which can be directly transferred to waterways. Organic compounds present in oil can act as complexation agents, resulting in increased solubilization of metals from sediments. The oil also serves as a carbon source for biodegradation, resulting in a decrease of the redox potential in the sediment, and thereby increasing the mobility of redox-sensitive metals (e.g., arsenic) and contributing to transformations of chemical species that result in increased toxicity and/or bioavailability (e.g., enhanced production of bioaccumulative methylmercury by anaerobic bacteria). To assess the potential for these processes to impact water quality in coastal watersheds, we will sample a series of seeps in Los Angeles and Ventura counties to characterize concentrations of organic (aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAHs) and inorganic (heavy metals) ​contaminants in oil from these seeps and in downstream waters, soils, and sediments. We will monitor other water quality parameters (pH, redox potential, etc.) as well as nutrients and ion concentrations to assess redox conditions and other geochemical changes.​\n\n​\n\nNorthridgeNorthridge$20,0002020-21 Grant Development Program\n\n​Microplastic ingestion by commercially important fishes\n\nLeighSamanthaGrant Development Program2020-21\n\n​\n\nMicroplastics (MPs) are an emerging pollutant of serious concern. Despite their pervasiveness, we are in the early stages of understanding the full effects of MP pollution on marine organisms. Because MPs are the same size range as microzooplankton and\n\nphytoplankton, they are vulnerable for consumption by marine primary consumers. Some potential effects of MP ingestion include blocked and damaged digestive tracts, the leaching of plastic toxicants, and the introduction of foreign microorganisms; all of which could potentially lead to growth deficits, reproductive issues, and decreased lifespan. This is of particular concern for commercially important species since they represent a critical\n\ndietary and economic resource. In California, over 120,000 people are employed by the seafood industry, which generates over $200 million per year to the state’s economy. Furthermore, over 3 billion people worldwide rely on seafood as their primary protein\n\nsource. This is why it is critical to understand how pervasive MP ingestion is by commercially important species. We will be investigating the prevalence of microplastic contamination in two important commercial fish species: the California Halibut\n\n(Paralichthys californicus) and the Pacific (Northern) Anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Using individuals caught from the southern California Bight, we will determine the types and sizes of MPs found in their tissues (digestive tract, liver, and muscle). These fishes\n\nare part of a natural southern California marine food web and will eventually be the focus of a larger study to investigate how MP ingestion and trophic transfer conveys physical MP particles and fibers, plastic-associated toxicants, and microbes. The data collected will be used to inform MP management policy as it relates to California commercial fisheries.\n\nDominguez Hills$20,0002020-21 Grant Developm"
