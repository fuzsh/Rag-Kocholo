        "text": "When Kris Sundahl’s family learned he might not be able to attend the Great Bend Chamber of Commerce banquet, they had to get creative. The result was to tell him a big white lie. Kris was taken aside and informed that his mom, Nancy, was going to be named Citizen of the Year and that he must attend the banquet to present her with the award. And, of course, he couldn’t say anything to her because the name of the winner is kept hush-hush until the banquet. Little did he know that he would be honored with the NextGen Award at the annual chamber gathering. “He said he would be coaching basketball out of town that weekend and was iffy on getting back in time for the banquet,” Nancy recalled. “We had to do something to make sure he came. It is safe to say the NextGen honor would come as a very, very big surprise.” Criteria for the award include being a leader in the work environment, as well as in the community. The nominee must also create a meaningful impact on the community and be seen as a rising leader. “Kris demonstrates every day why he deserves this prestigious recognition,” Nancy commented. “He is a leader who adds meaning to life, whether at home or at work.” Kris, 45, is a financial advisor at Edward Jones, 2016 19th. He is a single dad with two sons – Jakoby, 12, and Dylan, 10. After he moved back to Great Bend in 2018, “he had the opportunity to work for Edward Jones,” Nancy said. “Kris also wanted to get involved in his community and joined the Chamber; he is still an ambassador. He wants to give back to the community that has given so much to him. “Kris has been successful at his job, in part, because the guidance of Sonya Rein,” she added. “Also, he has time to be available to his boys and participate in their activities. They also enjoy the outdoors and finding new places to hike and explore nature.” Kris has a long history of coaching many youth sports, noted his dad, Kevin. “But it is not just about the games; it is about life – the ups and downs, the wins and losses. “When things don’t go your way or you face obstacles, you find a way to work through it,” Kevin continued. “Kris is great coach, has a good work ethic and is an excellent role model for young people.” More background Kris is a 1997 graduate of Great Bend High School and earned an associate’s degree in general studies two years later at Barton Community College. He went on to receive his bachelor’s in psychology in 2001 at Kansas State University and a master’s in history in 2015 at Wichita State University. From 2002-16, he was in law enforcement at Hutchinson, where he was a school resource officer for the school district. “Kris enjoyed law enforcement but wanted to be able to spend more time with his sons,” Kevin said. Jan Westfall, community leader who nominated Kris for the NextGen recognition, said “he is dedicated to this community and wants to continue to be a vital part of its growth and success. Kris wants to build for the future, not only for himself but for his two boys. “It is important to Kris to show his children the benefits of supporting your community and getting involved in civic groups, church and school activities.” Westfall also noted the extent of his community involvement. Kris is vice president of the Noon Lions Club; vice president of the USD 428 Education Foundation board; Family Crisis Center board member; and active member of Prince of Peace Parish and supporter of Holy Family School where his children are students. “On top of all that, Kris finds time to be a college basketball official and volunteers as a youth coach of basketball, baseball and football,” Westfall pointed out. Sonya Rein, another nominator, said “Kris has spent his life serving others in many capacities; he has a passion for helping others. He exemplifies the Edward Jones mission, which is to partner for positive impact, improve the lives of our clients and colleagues, and together, better our communities and society. “His Edward Jones branch continues to rise in the ranks of Practice Level Management,” continued Rein, senior branch office administrator. “And most important, Kris is a dedicated single dad who is a perfect fit for the NextGen Award criteria.” The award is sponsored by the Barton County Young Professionals, a chamber program. ABOUT NEXTGEN LEADER OF THE YEAR AWARD The NextGen Leader of the Year award is presented annually to an individual creating a meaningful impact as a rising leader in Barton County, Kansas.

Mark has played a big role in everything from Final Fridays to the huge downtown-loft project. These ventures, plus many others, are the reason Mark was recognized as Citizen of the Year during the Great Bend Chamber of Commerce annual banquet. “Despite his many contributions to Great Bend, Mark is kind of an introvert,” said Chris Bitter, his wife. “He certainly doesn’t like the spotlight.” Well, he got it anyway when he was presented with the special honor in front of hundreds of guests. Mark and Chris own Kustom Floor Designs, 1515 Main, which opened in 1979; both work at the family business. When trying to verbalize the reasons Mark deserves the award, one event stands out in the minds of Chris and their daughters, Cori and Lacey - the gathering after the Home for the Holidays Parade. “Mark said “wouldn’t it be cool to have a party?’” Chris recalled. “That led to families gathering for hot dogs, hot chocolate and carriage rides; and it continues to grow. “Mark always insists these community events be free of charge. He wants to engage the community and start family traditions. When he sees young people with families come home for the parade, Mark wants to find ways to encourage them to move back. That was the mind-set with Final Fridays too.” Chris pointed to another illustration of Mark’s drive to help Great Bend prosper. When he is out of town, he checks out the businesses and amenities in other downtowns. “His mind is always thinking about how we could incorporate something of value. And he has me doing the same thing. When I am out of town, I snap pictures because I know he wants to see what I saw.” The loft space downtown is a big focus now. “This was a vision of Mark’s when MyTown bought the Zarah Building. When he first saw the space, it was a mess to say the least. But he was undeterred. “Mark is aware there are negative comments about the lofts but he has a unique ability to shake them off. He constantly looks at the positives and always says that challenges and problems are opportunities. “People don’t have any idea about the hours and hours of research that go into a project like this. He continues to learn and knows it will work.” Bitter’s daughters Cori and Lacey didn’t have a difficult time elaborating on the extent of their dad’s commitment to Great Bend. “He doesn’t just talk,” Lacey said. “He figures out solutions; he wants to find ways to fuel the business community. But it’s not just that. He also is concerned about the quality-of-life aspects of Great Bend.” During his research on the lofts, Mark has zeroed in on municipal codes, demographics and the availability of grant funds. “You cannot imagine what has gone into this,” Lacey commented. Cori, who is the painter and finisher at Kustom Floor, noted that her dad mentors so many people in all walks of life. “Again, it’s not just the business side of things. He also mentors about personal development and leadership, while encouraging others to be their best. He wants his neighbors to lead meaningful lives. “What really stands out is that Dad has helped other contractors get their licenses even though they will be our competition. He looks at this as building for generations to come.” Cori and Lacey’s brother, Klint, now works for the family business too. Other insights Sara Arnberger, president of Great Bend Economic Development, mentioned four words that come to mind when she thinks about Mark: inspiration, passion, perseverance and community. “From the moment I met Mark, his innovative ideas and unwavering commitment to our community have propelled me to new heights,” Arnberger said. “Engaging in conversation with Mark infuses one with empowerment and optimism for our collective future. “Mark’s tireless efforts laid the groundwork for Great Bend’s prosperity, fostering the success of numerous events, projects and businesses. His enduring faith in our community, even during times of slow progress, serves as a beacon of resilience and hope. His contagious enthusiasm inspires me daily, and enriches the fabric of Great Bend.” Sheryl Cheely, MyTown board member, echoed some of Arnberger’s comments and mentioned Mark’s “love of Great Bend. He quietly raises money and is open to discussions about how to make our town better. “During the last 15 years, Mark has helped make MyTown work, with many contributions to Final Fridays and the after-parade party. He also worked with me to bring the Dolly Trolley to Great Bend. Mark is a very good businessman who has his employees’ respect and an eye for making things look beautiful.” ABOUT THE GREAT BEND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CITIZEN OF THE YEAR AWARD The Great Bend Chamber of Commerce annually recognizes outstanding service by an individual who contributes to the quality of life within the community of Great Bend. This award recognizes an individual who has given their time, talent, energy, and shown outstanding service to the community and members of the Great Bend Chamber of Commerce, or persons who have excelled in their chosen profession giving of their time and talent to enhance the culture and work environment around them.

It’s also the employees’ genuine concern for the community they serve. “I know this sounds cliché, but this is an amazing group of people,” said Barry Bowers, Spectrum partner. “They are exceptional employees who take care of their clients, while also being plugged in to the needs of their community.” For example, Operation Christmas Child has grown every year because of the employees, most of whom are long-time Barton County residents. They also serve Meals on Wheels, and support non-profits, civic clubs and churches. “If we didn’t have these people on staff, we wouldn’t have this award,” Bowers said. “This recognition is about everyone here, the business as a whole. We are selective about who we hire and it pays off every day. It’s great when you don’t mind coming to work.” In addition to Bowers, Cynthia Lockwood is a partner and Joni Haines is the administrator. Staff accountants are Rick Warnken, Tammy Curtis, Kayla Wimmer, Sheri Yager, John Lane, Ally Stocker and Santiago Talamantes. Penny Dreiling is the receptionist. Lockwood noted these colleagues comprise the team that offers a full-service menu of accounting services at 1400 Polk. This includes: payroll services; QuickBooks training; business consulting and planning; bookkeeping; income-tax services; investment tax planning; financial and estate planning; and human resources consulting. “We also continue to create new services as we stay up-to-date with the many changes in technology,” Lockwood said. “These changes happen at warp speed, while we offer more services electronically and remotely.” Spectrum appreciates not just the award itself, but also the Great Bend Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors it, she said. “This really is for the whole community and everyone appreciates it. “We come together at the annual banquet and celebrate the business community’s many successes. This is bigger than just one company; it speaks to the whole community.” Nominators Those who nominated Spectrum for the Business of the Year Award shared a few comments. Mark Mingenback, local businessman, said “Spectrum is an excellent example of a truly local firm being a great corporate citizen. It offers an outstanding professional team of CPAs, staff accountants and support staff.” Mingenback also noted the company’s “significant involvement with many local projects, along with financial donations. Employees give countless volunteer hours to the Kiwanis and Rotary clubs, Samaritan’s Purse, Great Bend Foundation, Golden Belt Community Foundation, Boy Scouts and the Chamber. I’m sure there are many more. “The bottom line is that Spectrum’s staff members live here and genuinely care about Great Bend’s prosperity.” Scott Donovan of Eagle Radio also noted that “it truly is the entire team that deserves this recognition. I see Spectrum staff at events all the time. When they sponsor a table for a worthy cause, and it fills up, they sponsor another table. This team really knows how to give back.” On the business side, Spectrum accountants understand what customer service is all about, Donovan added. “They add services that are requested by their clients and fulfill the needs of the business community. If you need help with payroll services, they can do that. If you have questions about running a company, tax advantages or profit sharing, they offer a business consulting service. “A trusted partner is hard to find but Spectrum is that partner for many companies in Great Bend and beyond.” Haley Ruble of FreeStyle Marketing echoed comments from Mingenback and Donovan, while noting “Spectrum stands as a beacon of excellence and community commitment, deserving of every accolade – especially the prestigious Business of the Year Award. What sets Spectrum apart is their financial expertise and unwavering dedication to the community. “Their ongoing support of non-profits and participation in local events exemplify their role as more than just a business entity. They are a true community partner.” And it is not just a “mere corporate responsibility; it is a genuine passion ingrained in their ethos,” Ruble continued. “Spectrum contributes to causes that uplift and empower those in need. This commitment is not just a one-time gesture but a sustained effort, which fosters a sense of trust and goodwill.” Furthermore, she noted, Spectrum’s involvement “serves as a testament to their belief in the strength of community connections. They contribute to the vibrancy of our local culture and economy and showcase their business acumen and their genuine interest in fostering a thriving economy. Spectrum is more than a financial-service provider. It is a cornerstone of community development.” ABOUT THE GREAT BEND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUSINESS OF THE YEAR AWARD The Business of the Year Award is an annual award showcasing companies demonstrating excellence in the marketplace.
