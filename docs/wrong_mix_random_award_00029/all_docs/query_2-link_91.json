        "text": "Image courtesy of Michael Vadon on Flickr\n\nThe U.S. Open is upon us. In New York City, it’s one of the big social events on the calendar with a guest list that includes everyone from A-listers to the average New Yorker. The U.S. Open is part of the Grand Slam of tennis: the Australian, French, and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon Championships.\n\nThe Open traces its roots back to the U.S. National Championship, established in 1881, but the first iteration of the modern-day U.S. Open took place in 1968 with Arthur Ashe taking the men’s singles victory (his name now graces a stadium). In 1978, the tournament moved to its current location at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center (then called National Tennis Center) in Queens. Past U.S. Open legends include Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Bob Bryan, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.\n\nPlanning on heading to the Open? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhere does the U.S. Open take place?\n\nSince 1978, the U.S. Open has been held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadow Corona Park in Queens. The venue was named for the tennis legend in 2006.\n\nWhen is the U.S. Open 2023?\n\nThis year, the U.S. Open takes place Aug. 28 – Sept. 10, and multiple matches are held each day.\n\nGates open at 9:30 a.m. for day sessions Aug. 28 – Sept. 6, and at 11 a.m. Sept. 7 -10. Gates open at 6 p.m. for night sessions Aug. 28 – Sept. 8. “Arthur Ashe Stadium will open at 6:30 p.m. or 40 minutes after the conclusion of the day sessions.”\n\nWho are the players to watch in the U.S. Open?\n\nSpain’s Carlos Alcaraz and Serbia’s Novak Djokovic are the names on everyone’s mind when it comes to men, and Poland’s Iga Swiatek is the frontrunner for women.\n\nHow much is a ticket to the U.S. Open?\n\nTicket prices and packages vary. One-day passes are available for both day and evening times, and range in price from about $100 to upwards of $1,000 depending on seats. There are also weekly and series packages for those who don’t want to miss any of the action, but those packages are all sold out on the U.S. Open site. Luxury suites are also available and range in price to upwards of close to $3,000.\n\nHow to get to the U.S. Open\n\nThe USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is reachable by subway, train, or car.\n\nSubway: Take the 7 to Mets-Willets Point Station\n\nTrain: Take the LIRR to Mets-Willets Point StationCar: Paid parking is available at Mets Stadium (except on days when a Mets game is happening) or at ​​the Shops at Skyview. Rideshares will drop riders off at the New York State Pavilion, and they should walk or take a complimentary shuttle to the stadium.\n\nDining at the U.S. Open?\n\nThere are tons of food and beverage options at the U.S. Open from NYC eateries, including Eataly, Korilla BBQ, San Matteo NYC and Taqueria Nixtamal, among others.\n\nAces is a full-service restaurant serving food from Michelin Star Chef Ed Brown, Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto and Chef Kwame Onwuachi and Champions Bar & Grill serves food from Champions by Benjamin Steakhouse.

There is no official dress code, but in 2022, Vogue recommended women wear all-white, tennis-inspired outfits or preppy summer dresses. In 2023, Town and Country posted inspo with a similar vibe. For footwear, comfortable shoes are a smart choice as you may need to walk around the stadium and to your transportation.\n\nCelebrity sightings at the U.S. Open\n\nWhy does it matter what you wear? Well, it doesn’t really, but the U.S. Open is famously crawling with celebrities, so you may want to look your best in case you rub shoulders with one!\n\nAmong A-listers spotted last year were: Anne Hathaway, Kendall Jenner, Zach Braff, Anna Wintour, Jerry Seinfeld, Jon Bon Jovi, Jason Biggs and Lin-Manuel Miranda, Karlie Kloss, Joe Jonas, and Emily Ratajkowski, just to name a few.\n\nBut 2022 was a big year as it was potentially Serena Williams’ last Open. The tennis megastar wrote in a Vogue essay that she was “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.” However, a few months later, she said she was actually not retiring and that she would likely return to the sport. Williams is not playing in this year’s U.S. Open, but her sister, Venus was awarded a wild card into the women’s singles main draw. This will be her 24th main draw, according to the U.S. Open.\n\nU.S. Open watch parties\n\nCan’t make it in person? Find a watch party in your neighborhood.
