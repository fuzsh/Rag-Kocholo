If a discussion presents an antitrust issue, raise your concern immediately. If the discussion continues, announce that you are leaving the meeting because you have an antitrust concern and immediately report your concern to AFPM staff and legal counsel. These Guidelines apply both during the meeting and at informal social events involving AFPM members.\n\nThis reference is an overview of AFPM's Antitrust Guidelines. It is not a substitute for legal counsel. Any and all antitrust related concerns should be addressed to AFPM's General Counsel.\n\nEthical Responsibility and Professional and Personal Conduct Code\n\nThe American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (“AFPM”) has adopted the following “Ethical Responsibility and Professional and Personal Conduct Code” (hereinafter, “the Code”). Every member of AFPM, their designated representatives, and non-member attendees at all AFPM meetings and forums agree to abide by the Code as a condition of membership in AFPM and attendance and participation at AFPM meetings and forums.\n\nThe Code requires the following of all individuals attending AFPM meetings and forums:\n\nAdherence to the AFPM bylaws and the AFPM policies and procedures, as adopted by AFPM’s Board of Directors.\n\nStrict compliance with antitrust laws.\n\nAdherence to all applicable federal and state laws.\n\nMaintenance of the highest level of professional and personal ethical behavior while attending AFPM meetings and forums.\n\nPrevention of certain behaviors, including harassment, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind involving race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or, where applicable, veteran or marital status.\n\nAssurance that conduct at all times and in all professional and personal dealings with each other and other attendees is with the highest level of integrity and courtesy.\n\nSharing of knowledge and expertise as speakers at AFPM educational events and sessions whenever practicable, without soliciting or explicitly promoting their own organization's products or services.\n\nWorking to instill public and consumer confidence in the petrochemical and refining industries, its member companies, and its professionals, avoiding any action conducive to discrediting members of AFPM.\n\nRefraining from scheduling general attendance meetings, receptions or other events at times that conflict with substantive programming or social events at AFPM meetings without express written permission of AFPM.\n\nFailure to abide by the Code may result, for the first offense, in informal censure of a company or individual by the AFPM Executive Committee. If violations of the Code continue after such an informal censure, a company may be subject to expulsion from AFPM, or an individual to exclusion from participation in AFPM activities, by the Board of Directors.\n\nEntertainment Policy\n\nWe ask your cooperation in observing Association policy on activities held in conjunction with any AFPM meeting:\n\nMeetings or social activities should not be scheduled that take registrants away from AFPM programs and AFPM-sponsored activities;\n\nAny company sponsoring a function to which 25 or more people are invited should outline its plans for advance approval by AFPM. In general, such functions will be approved if they do not unduly take registrants away from AFPM-sponsored activities;\n\nAll representatives of companies sponsoring hospitality activities are expected to register for the meeting;\n\nHospitality suites are expected to close by 12:00 a.m.;\n\nFood, beverage and service personnel (bartenders, hostesses, etc.) must be obtained through the hotel catering department;\n\nSuite promotional activities are to avoid the use of elaborate entertainment, expensive door prizes, suite attendance solicitation by individuals who are not full-time employees of the sponsoring company, or other similar activities."
