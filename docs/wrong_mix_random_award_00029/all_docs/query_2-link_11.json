The guest's favorite, most nostalgic meal sets the tone for the stories of their childhood, growth, failure, triumph, and everything in between. These meals could be anything from a homemade version of a packaged baked good like a Twinkie, to re-creations of a special family gumbo. Bryan will do his best to make these from SCRATCH! Bryanâs goal is to elicit the Proust Effect for his guests, where special memories are triggered by food. Guaranteed for lots of laughs, Bryan doesnât always get the meal quite right, but they always have fun, get real, and share something delicious.\n\nCook and bake these meals for yourself!
