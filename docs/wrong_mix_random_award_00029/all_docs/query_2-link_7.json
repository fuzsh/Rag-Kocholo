        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"American Pie\" was released in 1999 and created an entire new genre: the teen sex comedy.\n\nWhile it hasn't aged in the best way, it spawned an entire franchise and jump-started many careers.\n\nJim's dad, played by Eugene Levy, turns 75 on December 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Biggs played Jim Levenstein, a typical awkward high schooler with an affection for apple pie.\n\nBiggs had only appeared in three films before securing the lead role in \"American Pie\" in 1999, though he had been nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his performance in \"As the World Turns.\"\n\nHe reprised his role as Jim in 2001's \"American Pie 2\" and 2003's \"American Wedding,\" in addition to appearing in films like \"Loser,\" \"Prozac Nation,\" \"Jersey Girl,\" and \"Eight Below.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggs, 43, is best-known now for his role as Larry in \"Orange Is the New Black.\"\n\nBiggs is mainly known for his TV roles now — he starred in 13 episodes of \"Mad Love\" on CBS before it got canceled in 2011.\n\nSoon after, he secured the role of Larry, the fiancé of main character Piper, on one of Netflix's first original series, \"Orange Is the New Black.\" He appeared in 22 episodes across four seasons.\n\nBiggs then tried another sitcom, \"Outmatched,\" which was canceled after one season in March 2020. He now hosts a game show on Fox called \"Cherries Wild.\"\n\nWith the rest of the cast, he returned for 2012's \"American Reunion.\"\n\nSince 2008, Biggs has been married to fellow actress and \"My Best Friend's Girl\" co-star Jenny Mollen. They have two sons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlyson Hannigan played Michelle, another high school student who had some interesting experiences at band camp.\n\nBy the time \"American Pie\" was released in 1999, Hannigan was already a teen icon for her role as Willow on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" for two years. She'd play Willow for the rest of the series until its end in 2003. She also appeared in three episodes of its spin-off, \"Angel.\"\n\nHannigan also appeared in \"American Pie 2\" and \"American Wedding,\" as well as \"Boys and Girls\" with her \"American Pie\" co-star Jason Biggs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannigan, 47, starred on \"How I Met Your Mother\" from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSoon after \"Buffy\" ended in 2003, Hannigan began starring on \"How I Met Your Mother\" (\"HIMYM\") in 2005 as Lily Aldrin. She appeared in over 200 episodes and was one of the show's core five stars alongside Josh Radnor, Cobie Smulders, Neil Patrick Harris, and her on-screen husband Jason Segel.\n\nSince 2016, Hannigan has hosted the magic competition series \"Penn & Teller: Fool Us.\" She also hosted \"Girl Scout Cookie Championship\" in 2020. Hannigan also co-hosts \"Adorableness,\" a spin-off of \"Ridiculousness,\" on MTV.\n\nOn the acting front, Hannigan has a voice role in the Disney Channel cartoon \"Fancy Nancy,\" and she played Kim Possible's mother Dr. Ann Possible in the 2019 live-action adaptation of \"Kim Possible.\" Hannigan also reprised the role of Michelle in \"American Wedding.\"\n\nHannigan has been married to her \"Buffy\" co-star Alexis Denisof since 2003 — he also had a role on \"HIMYM\" as Sandy, a co-worker of Smulder's character, Robin — and they have two children together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas Ian Nicholas played Kevin, Jim's only friend with a steady girlfriend.\n\nBefore \"American Pie,\" Nicholas had co-starred with future A-listers Kate Winslet and Daniel Craig in the 1995 box-office bomb \"A Kid in King Arthur's Court.\"\n\nAfter \"American Pie 2\" and \"American Wedding,\" Nicholas played Frank Sinatra, Jr., in the TV movie \"Stealing Sinatra.\" He also appeared in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" and the unofficial \"American Psycho\" sequel \"The Rules of Attraction.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas Ian Nicholas, 41, is now an actor and producer.\n\nBesides \"American Reunion\" in 2012, Nicholas has appeared in various indie films. He played Abbie Hoffman in \"The Chicago 8,\" (a story which would later be adapted in Aaron Sorkin's \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\" starring Sacha Baron Cohen as Hoffman). He also played Walt Disney in the 2015 biopic \"Walt Before Mickey,\" Martin Scorsese in \"Zeroville,\" and he produced and starred in the 2021 film \"Adverse.\"\n\nOn the TV front, he recurred in the 2014 Fox series \"Red Band Society.\"\n\nNicholas has been married to musician DJ Colette since 2007. They have two children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin's girlfriend, Vicky, was played by Tara Reid.\n\nReid was one of the more established cast members of \"American Pie,\" as she had made her film debut over 10 years prior in the 1987 adaptation of the Stephen King novel \"Salem's Lot.\" She also played Bunny in \"The Big Lebowski\" in 1998.\n\nIn the '90s and early 2000s, besides \"American Pie 2,\" Reid appeared in multiple classics, including \"Cruel Intentions,\" \"Josie and the Pussycats,\" and \"Van Wilder.\" She also appeared in 11 episodes of \"Scrubs\" from 2003 to 2005.\n\nReid was involved in one of the most 2000s relationships of all time: She dated \"TRL\" host Carson Daly from 2000 to 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReid, 46, appeared in six \"Sharknado\" films from 2013 to 2018.\n\nReid has mainly stuck to TV films over the last few years, most famously as part of the \"Sharknado\" franchise, playing April Wexler in all six films. She co-stars with another iconic actor of the '80s and '90s, \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" star Ian Ziering.\n\nShe also had her own reality series on E! from 2005 to 2006 called \"Taradise.\" In 2011, she appeared on the UK version of \"Celebrity Big Brother.\"\n\nReid played herself in a tongue-in-cheek cameo on \"The Boys\" in 2019.
