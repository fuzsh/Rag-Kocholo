        "text": "Provost’s List – students have earned a Semester Grade Point Average of 4.0 or higher for a full-time schedule of courses (12 or more credits, of which only 3 are Pass/Fail)\n\nNote: The Dean’s and the Provost’s Lists are calculated within one month after the end of each 16-week semester. The Dean’s and Provost’s Lists are not calculated for the summer term. A student who is ineligible for inclusion at the time the lists are calculated will not be given Dean’s or Provost’s List status retroactively. For example, a student who completes an Incomplete, i.e., “I” grade, after the list is calculated and raises his or her GPA to 3.75-3.99 will NOT receive Dean’s List status. Omissions or errors in calculation on the part of the University of Charleston, however, will be corrected when detected."
