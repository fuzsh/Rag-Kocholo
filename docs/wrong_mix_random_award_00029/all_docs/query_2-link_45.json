I loved them. „ ~ Lucas Biggs rationalizing his molesting of children.\n\nLucas Biggs is the main antagonist of the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \"Quarry\". He is a serial child molester and murderer suspected of murdering seven-year-old Jeffrey Ronson.\n\nHe was portrayed by John Savage, who also portrayed Rudolph Ransom in Star Trek: Voyager.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nBiggs' father abandoned him as an infant and he looked to a neighbor up the street as a father figure. However, that neighbor was a pedophile who sexually abused him for years. Biggs was so warped by the abuse that he became a child molester himself, preying on preadolescent and adolescent boys. He also became a Minor League Baseball player, traveling all over the country to play baseball and coach Little League, while also sexually abusing the boys he coached. He kept each of the victim's baseball caps as souvenirs and relive the memory of abusing them. He memorized each cap's owner by their smell, instantly recalling the exact date and place where he abused each boy.\n\nIn 1980, he molested and raped 13-year-old Deacon Brinn, warping the boy's mind and turning him into a pedophile. Brinn later raped seven-year-old Avery Shaw and raped and murdered Avery's friend Jeffrey Ronson. A few years later, Biggs was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for killing one of his victims. Suspicion also fell on him for Jeffrey's murder, but the police were never able to prove it.\n\n\"Quarry\"[]\n\nIn 2005, Biggs loses his last appeal, and is set for execution. A week before he is to be put to death, he is visited by Detective Olivia Benson of the NYPD's Special Victims Unit, who had received an anonymous tip about Jeffrey's murder; Benson thinks that Biggs sent it in hopes of stalling the execution. Biggs denies it, however, and also denies killing Jeffrey.\n\nBenson later searches Biggs' old storage locker and finds hundreds of boys' baseball caps, which he kept to relive the memory of molesting them. Benson brings the caps to Biggs, who identifies each of the caps' owners by their smell, instantly recalling the exact date and place where he abused each boy. Benson then presents him with Jeffrey's cap, but he once again denies that he ever molested or murdered him; he does admit to abusing Deacon Brinn, however. Brinn confirms that Biggs molested him, but says he knows nothing about Jeffrey's murder.\n\nLater, Brinn is murdered, and Benson discovers that he killed Jeffrey. She visits Biggs one last time to interview him about the stalker who had blackmailing Brinn shortly before his death. During the interview, Benson realizes that Biggs was abused as a child. At first, Biggs defensively claims that his abuser loved him, but then bursts into tears as he remembers how traumatic his abuse had been, finally understanding what he had done to his victims. Benson asks him if he ever noticed Deacon hanging around with younger boys, and Biggs identifies Shaw as Brinn's former victim. This eventually leads Benson to discover that Shaw sent her the information about Jeffrey's death, and that Brinn was actually murdered by his wife as retribution for molesting their son.\n\nSoon afterward, Biggs is executed.\n\n[]\n\nLucas Biggs on the Law & Order Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
