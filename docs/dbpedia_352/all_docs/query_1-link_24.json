        "text": "Spyder® BACnet® programmable VAV controllers are MS/TP network devices designed to control HVAC equipment. These controllers provide many options and advanced system features that allow state-of-the-art commercial building control. Each controller is programmable and configurable using the Niagara Framework® software.\n\nSpyder BACnet controllers require the Spyder BACnet Programmable Feature to be licensed in the WEB pro workbench tool and the WEBs-AX™ JACE® Controller for programming and downloading. Spyder BACnet models are also available as individually licensed controllers (ILC). The ILC versions are identical in design and capability in every detail except for the licensing. The built-in individual licensing of the Spyder ILCs allows them to be programmed and downloaded with any brand of the Niagara Workbench or JACE controller. The Spyder ILCs are identified with a suffix on the part number of -ILC.\n\nThe controllers are for use in variable air volume (VAV), unitary, and advanced HVAC control applications. Each controller contains a host microcontroller to run the main HVAC application and a second microcontroller for BACnet MS/TP network communications. Each controller provides flexible, universal inputs for external sensors, digital inputs, and a combination of analog outputs and digital outputs.\n\nFeatures & Benefits:\n\nEIA-485 communications network; Capable of baud rates between 9.6 and 115.2 kbits/s\n\nCapable of standalone operation, but can also use BACnet MS/TP network communications\n\nSylk™ bus for use with Sylk-enabled sensors\n\nSupport for up to 40 controllers per BACnet MS/TP segment (under 30 is recommended)\n\nFunction block engine allows the application designer to program the controller to perform a wide variety of HVAC applications\n\nBuilt-in zone control functions include a remote wall module interface and a scheduler\n\nPressure-independent or pressure-dependent single or dual-duct variable air volume (VAV) control\n\nEasy user access to airflow sensor inputs\n\nAll wiring connections are made to removable terminal blocks to simplify controller installation and replacement\n\nBoth controller housing and actuator are UL plenum rated\n\nCertifications:"
