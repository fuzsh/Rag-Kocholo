        "text": "MISSION STATEMENT\n\nAt L&H Airco, we take the lead in building automation by providing creative engineering solutions and forward-thinking technology to deliver maximum value for our customersâ investments.\n\nAlways looking towards the future, L&H Airco is an independent company who is not defined by factory restrictions or quotas. Driven by creative innovation and high industry standards, we recognize our dynamic team of employees who are comprised of project and field engineers, programmers, graphic designers, project managers, installers, and support staff. We encourage our employees to expand within their professional roles while supporting and mentoring them along the way. We are dedicated to delivering optimum value to our customersâ investments while assuring the growth of our company and our dedicated employees who contribute to its success.\n\nHISTORY\n\nFounded in 1968 in San Francisco, California, our original headquarters was a manufacturerâs representative firm handling complementary lines of commercial heating and air conditioning equipment. By the mid-1970s we became involved in turn-key, field-erected cooling towers and also opened up a manufacturing facility in San Jose, California, where we designed and produced custom air handlers.\n\nDuring the 1980s, L&H Airco evolved and we began offering comprehensive, cost-effective products and services for comfort control, energy conservation, and integrated facility management applications.\n\nHolding pace with industry technology and trends in the 1990s, we expanded our portfolio to include design and installation of Novar control systems. In 1995, we became an Alerton dealer and expanded our company from a small staff of six to 85 employees. As our controls business grew, service and customer training became a key focus.\n\nIn the 2000s, our automation group concentrated on providing enhanced solutions for integrated facility management systems throughout California. Currently, we represent Alerton and Distech temperature controls and Blue Ridge Technologies lighting controls. Complementing our automation solutions are a full suite of partner products, including Secure Aire.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nL&H Airco and our employees are committed to giving back and volunteering within our local community. Through sponsorships, fundraising efforts, and internship programs, we are dedicated to helping those in need. Industry support is provided through apprenticeship programs including trainings and skills challenges.\n\nWe support the following non-profit, charitable organizations: ASHRAE Sacramento Valley Chapter, ASHRAE Sierra Delta Chapter, Ronald McDonald House Charities, Copper for Kids, Wind Youth Services, Whitney High School Football, Sacramento County - Gifts from the Heart, Operation Cookie Munster, Navy Seal Foundation, and Special Operations Warrior Foundation.\n\nFEATURED CHARITY\n\nÂ Â Â Okizu - Supporting Families with Childhood Cancer\n\nÂ Â Â The mission of Okizu is to help all members of families affected by childhood cancer to heal through peer support, respite, Â Â Â mentoring, and recreational programs.\n\nDonate"
