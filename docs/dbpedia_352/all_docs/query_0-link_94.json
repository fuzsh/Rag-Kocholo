        "text": "Energy and facility management company, NexRev, has developed a much-needed solution for customers currently managing their building management systems on the soon-to-be retired Tridium Niagara AX framework. Their Freedom Choice Building Management System (BMS) enables companies to manage and control all their sites from a single enterprise platform – including those on the Niagara AX, Niagara N4, as well as the Novar Opus framework. This progressive approach allows multi-site customers a way of managing their disparate systems through a single interface which has not been available in the marketplace until now.\n\n“When Tridium announced it was retiring its Niagara AX framework, numerous companies who control their facilities with a Building Management Systems (BMS) were left looking for a solution to integrate multiple platforms under one solution,” said Kenneth Smith, CEO of NexRev. “We knew our talented team of developers and engineers could build a migration path that would give customers the ability to future-proof their portfolio, and that’s exactly what we built with our Freedom Choice solution.”\n\nNexRev’s Freedom Choice delivers a superior user experience through faster access speed and control of building assets across an entire portfolio. Its simple navigation, multi-site tools, and portfolio view make it attractive to energy and facility managers who are tasked with keeping their facilities comfortable while controlling costs. A bonus of the Freedom Choice system is that it can be accessed from any computer, tablet, or phone for facility managers who are typically on-the-go.\n\nWith multi-site customers requiring the highest standards for cyber security, Freedom Choice includes comprehensive enterprise-wide measures to protect customer data as well as provides ongoing software updates and maintenance patches that will not only meet, but exceed information technology (IT) governance requirements.\n\nIn addition, Freedom Choice gives customers the opportunity to access analytics that bridge the multiple frameworks from AX and N4 to Novar Opus and third-party data (e.g., billing data, weather data, etc.), giving customers the true ability to drive action across their entire portfolio. Freedom Analytics also allows customers to use simple words and phrases to build new reports in real-time, a feature that has received rave reviews.\n\n“We weren’t sure how we would bridge the gap from AX to N4 until NexRev showed us their Freedom Choice solution. They have been very forward thinking to ensure we won’t lose sight of any of our stores as we migrate to the latest framework,” said Bryan Martin, senior manager of facility services and energy management at Pilot Company.\n\nAbout NexRev\n\nNexRev is an energy and facilities management company, helping clients realize operational efficiencies while proactively managing the cost of comfort.
