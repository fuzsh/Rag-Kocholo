You can also have a service provider of another brand of Niagara-based products support the system as well. No special licenses must be added or changed when deploying a VYKON product.\n\nBuilding possibility with the Niagara Framework®\n\nThe pace of innovation has never been more rapid, and now, more than ever, agility is key.
