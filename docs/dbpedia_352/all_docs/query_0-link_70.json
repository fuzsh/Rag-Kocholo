And that's just one pump.\n\nIt’s not that hard, a simple plc can do most of it with some programming. Just depends on how fancy you want to get. I designed a greenhouse EMS for big Orange many years ago. They were kicking out Wadsworth because everything in their system was proprietary, and wanted ridiculous prices for replacement parts, and were no longer building greenhouses on the stores. I simply used a two stage digital thermostat as a controller, it actually worked better than Wadsworth, as it maintained a much more consistent temperature in the greenhouse. I controlled the ridge vents, shade cloth, heaters and the exhaust fans. With that one thermostat. Every component could be got off the shelf at a nearby Grainger.\n\nI have seen this done using regular PLCs and HMIs, and I have done so myself for smaller systems.\n\nThere is nothing special about the control systems supplied by the big boys for this purpose.\n\nThe big thing is they have canned routines to do certain things. In modern PLCs you can create these routines once yourself so they work like you want them to work instead of how the system manufacturer thinks they should work, and then just reuse them as needed.\n\nI will say this. If the project exceeds a few handfuls of I/O, you will want a seriously experienced engineer doing the programming. This is not something that the average electrician should be handling. It can get very messy very quickly. You also need to make sure someone is updating the drawings. This often gets forgotten and down the road no one can figure out how it works because the drawings were either never done at all, or not kept up to date. Yes, believe it or not, I have seen people try to do substantial sized projects of this type with either no drawings at all or just some half-$$$ed hand sketches in an attempt to save money. There is also the tendency to try and get contract programming on the cheap. Usually the mess that results ends up with the customer deciding to rip out the system eventually because the documentation provided (if any) is all but impossible to follow or not up to date, or the cheap work done is not up to snuff.\n\nThe first one I ever worked on, was an old Walmart, this was before they went to Novar. Anyhow, the Forman told me to rip it out, they weren’t going to use it anymore. After I get nearly all of it ripped out, he came back and said “wait, they are keeping it, and we got to wire the new addition to it also!” I reverse engineered it, and was able to get it back to working along with new lighting and hvac. No wiring diagrams whatsoever!\n\nA lot easier to put it back together if you are the one that ripped it out.\n\nI don't know how complicated a Walmart BMS is. I would be seriously offended if I had to try and troubleshoot something like this 5 years from now and there were no drawings or other documentation on how it is setup.\n\nI will say there are some of these systems that you can embed at least some limited documentation into the configuration of the system so a knowledgeable person down the road can access it, which makes things much simpler to troubleshoot than having no clue at all as to what is there.\n\nIt’s not that hard, a simple plc can do most of it with some programming. Just depends on how fancy you want to get.\n\nWell, that's it really. \"BMS\" in my mind usually means many devices and lots of controls. It's a matter of scope (as I tried to say at the end) and how polished you want it to be.\n\nOr, a couple of remote control ToD thermostats and some lighting controls does not make for a \"BMS\". One could argue that without data logging & display, and some form of alerting, you don't have a \"management system\" at all, you just have some programmed devices.\n\nOh my, I can't see why anyone would want to create a BMS from scratch (unless they have 20 years to do it).\n\nAssuming you plan to use a commercially-available system (post #2), the brains for most of them are server-class computers using PCs as the management terminals.

At the 5 million square foot hospital/ research centers, Ambutory care building that I retired from they had JCI & Siemens for BSO.In a new 12 story ambutory care building they had several techs their for what seemed like a year to get everything programmed & up running.I had great results with the full time JCI tech on campus. When I would get called in middle of the night or a weekend to troubleshoot a VFD that was down I would call him at home where he could pull the system up on his laptop and troubleshoot his controls. Had to throw out a Siemens tech out on a Sunday morning. I troubleshoot a VFD was down due to thier pressure switche being bad. He told me that he had to call in a fitter to replace a basic two wire switch. Jumped it out to get the drive working. Always received quicker & better service from JCI over hard to deal with Siemens."
