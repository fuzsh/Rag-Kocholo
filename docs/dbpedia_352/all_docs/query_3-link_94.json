        "text": "Under the Environment Protection Act 1993 (EP Act), the EPA administers 3 types of authorisations: licences, exemptions and works approvals.\n\nLicensing is a fundamental tool under the EP Act to control risks and reduce environmental impacts. It provides the EPA with the power to regulate activities undertaken by South Australian businesses or industry that pose significant risk to the environment.\n\nLicences make up the significant majority (approximately 95%) of authorisations administered by the EPA. It is common for the term licence to be used interchangeably with the term authorisation.\n\nExemptions are granted under certain circumstances to allow a business to operate outside of the requirements under the EP Act and/or environment protection policies (referred to as EPPs).\n\nWorks approvals are granted under some circumstances to allow a business to carry out construction, alteration or installation of a building, structure, plant or equipment to be used for a licensed activity.\n\nA works approval is generally not required if the works have already been subject to the development assessment process under the Planning, Development and Infrastructure Act 2016. In this circumstance the EPA may already have had the opportunity to provide comment or set conditions through powers conferred under the Development Act."
