        "text": "There are over 9,500 acres of woodland at Novar of which a quarter is managed using Low Impact Silvicultural Systems. Much of this area covers the slopes of Cnoc Fyrish, Cnoc Duchaire and Meann Cnoc and has been designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) to conserve habitat for Scotlandâ€™s decreasing population of capercaillie. Control of deer numbers is an important factor in the management of the woodland as this provides a favourable environment for natural regeneration.\n\nProduction of timber from the whole enterprise is around 25,000 tonnes a year, the bulk of which is sold to sawmills in the north and east of Scotland. 1,500 tonnes of the poorer timber is retained and chipped for fuelwood and a further 2,000 tonnes of the larger logs, mainly Douglas Fir and Larch is processed at the Novar Sawmill.\n\nWith an annual timber production in the region of 25,000 tonnes, Novar Estate supplies its sawmill with the best quality timber. Novar Sawmill is a dynamic enterprise that employs highly skilled personnel and contributes to a well-established Highland forestry tradition of log to final form.\n\nThe sawmill is equipped with the latest technology, guaranteeing quality and consistency in production. By collecting the by-products and reprocessing them into biofuel, waste is virtually eliminated, allowing for competitive pricing.\n\nTimber outbuildings, sheds, cladding, beams, decking and one-off items are among many products the sawmill manufactures in-house using homegrown Larch and Douglas Fir wherever possible. Novar sawmill is in the unusual position of having design and production on the same site, allowing for mid-production alterations to be carried out more easily, especially on complex projects. The design team works with architects, the construction industry, and other estates across Scotland. It also has a growing reputation for creating high-specification bespoke products.\n\nNovar Estate has provided land for renewable enterprises for over 40 years and we intend to continue this good work. We consider this to be an investment for the future of our community, country and the world beyond. The cleaner our energy sources, the safer our world becomes.\n\nHome to three hydro schemes at Blackrock, Glen Glass and Altnacealgach, and two wind farms high up on moorland, five miles west of Alness, electricity powered on the estate supplies the local community as well as the national grid meaning the impact is felt nationwide.\n\nRenewable energy initiatives create jobs that boost the local economy. The income generated from them brings in much-needed funds for local community projects by way of the Community Benefit Fund: the more energy generated, the greater the sum energy companies re-invest into their host communities. The energy is clean and ethically sound so everyone involved can benefit from it."
