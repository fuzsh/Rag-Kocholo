        "text": "In the mid-1970s, Honeywell Controls trained Mike Weber to perform energy audits and design energy-saving solutions. Since then, we have saved our customers tens of millions of dollars through our energy audit and energy management services.\n\nWhile we save our clients energy daily by engineering new and more efficient systems for their homes and business, energy audits are another step.\n\nWhen we enter into a contract with customers, we begin an investigation to determine the following:\n\n1. Where are their energy dollars going?\n\na. We run a computerized heat load/heat gain calculation to determine the HVAC requirements.\n\nb. We evaluate all existing HVAC&R equipment for its rated and current operating efficiency.\n\nc. We evaluate the entire building for large non-HVAC&R uses that may have an opportunity for change.\n\nd. We evaluate the building envelope (windows, doors, insulation, and roof) for problem areas or locations of excess heat loss or gain.\n\n2. What are the opportunities for savings? We list all of the possibilities for savings and begin to evaluate the practicality of each project individually. That is where steps three through five come in.\n\n3. What are the savings of implementing the changes? We gather three years of utility usage and charges. Our experts then enter these into a spreadsheet with other pertinent data, such as:\n\nHeating/cooling degree days\n\nSpecific building design\n\nAny peculiarities that would affect the building balance point\n\nOther factors to determine the cost of heating and cooling\n\nFixed costs of lighting and other uses\n\n4. What is the cost of implementing the changes?\n\n5. What is the Return On Investment (ROI) for making those changes? In most cases, we present our customers with a list of several different project opportunities. We then provide them with the costs and expected or guaranteed energy savings.\n\nSome projects also offer maintenance and repair cost savings. The ROI is simply the ratio of total savings over cost. Most of our clients find that the ROI is a valuable tool in prioritizing projects."
