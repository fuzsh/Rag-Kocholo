        "text": "CLEVELAND, June 22 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today a new rental program through its Novar division called FlexStart to help commercial national account customers benefit from smart-grid ready building controls and energy management systems technology.\n\nWith FlexStart, multi-site businesses rent – rather than purchase – Novar's Opus family of smart-grid ready building controls and energy management systems (EMS) technology to gain immediate savings without an up-front capital investment.\n\nEnergy consumption is a significant cost driver for multi-site businesses, such as retailers, restaurants, supermarkets, theaters, banks and other chain business operations. Novar's centralized monitoring facility and its industry-leading technology and energy management solutions enable these multi-site operations to optimize their energy consumption across their sites and drive overall cost savings.\n\n\"With Novar's FlexStart rental program, multi-site businesses can become cash-flow positive in month one,\" said Novar President Dean Lindstrom. \"We developed the FlexStart rental program to help customers improve operations and reduce their energy spend while enjoying flexible payment terms with no up-front capital investment.\"\n\nBusinesses can enjoy a 20% reduction on their energy costs through the use of Novar's Opus technology. Using Novar Professional Services can further drive savings, by having a team of energy experts working around the clock ensuring every dollar of conservation is being achieved. Novar Professional Services can result in an additional 5-8% reduction in their energy spend, and have over 100% return on investment.\n\nNovar's Opus Family of building control and EMS systems help national account operators with hundreds or thousands of facilities by providing a way of monitoring, controlling and managing how energy is consumed across their portfolio of sites – whether they are self managing from their own corporate headquarters, or engaging Novar to manage them from the Novar Operations Center (NOC). Customers use Opus to simultaneously manage heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting and refrigeration control, enforce corporate standards, and take advantage of financial incentives offered as part of Smart Grid utility programs that require the business to reduce electricity consumption on demand.\n\nFlexStart offers a flexible, affordable means of immediately deploying Novar's Opus family of technology, which is capable of supporting utilities and Independent System Operator (ISO) initiatives such as time-of-day pricing and automated demand response (ADR).\n\n\"Novar is committed to helping our customers prepare for upcoming Smart Grid requirements such as being charged more during times of peak use, such as in the afternoon on a hot summer day,\" said Novar Vice President of Marketing David Haynes. \"We offer a full range of energy management solutions to meet our customers' unique needs,\" said Haynes. \"Customers can choose as much or as little as they need.\"\n\nThe FlexStart program is available for new installations and upgrades of existing building controls and energy management systems which include HVAC, lighting and refrigeration systems. With a wide breadth of programs, Novar enables multi-site businesses to tailor their energy management programs to their own unique energy and cost savings objectives. Under FlexStart, Novar also extends its full equipment warranty throughout the full term of the rental agreement, and customers may also realize tax benefits related to monthly rental payments under the program.\n\nAbout Novar\n\nNovar is part of Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions group, a global leader in providing product and service solutions that improve efficiency and profitability, support regulatory compliance, and maintain safe, comfortable environments in homes, buildings and industry.
