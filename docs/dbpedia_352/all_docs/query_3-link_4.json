        "text": "Aerospace and high-tech manufacturer says it wil keep Novar’s intelligent building systems division, but will divest the Indalex aluminum solutions and security printing services divisions.Morristown”s Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) said Thursday it has received final clearance from the European Union”s antitrust office to buy Novar, a British industrial holding company, for $1.5 billion in cash.In a press release, Honeywell said it has assumed control of Novar, whose core divisions are intelligent building systems (IBS), Indalex aluminum solutions (IAS) and security printing services (SPS).Honeywell said it will begin to integrate the IBS business into its automation and control solutions (ACS) business immediately. The company plans to divest the IAS and SPS divisions within a year. “Novar is a great investment for Honeywell,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell”s chairman and CEO.”The IBS business fits perfectly with our ACS business and significantly strengthens our European fire detection, environmental controls, security, and services businesses. The IAS and SPS divisions of Novar are very strong businesses in their respective industries. They just don”t fit with the Honeywell portfolio.” Honeywell expects Novar to add about $1 billion in annual sales to its ACS unit, which expects 2005 sales of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion with profit margins of 11% to 12%. The company also expects to receive about $1 billion to $1.5 billion from the sale off Novar”s aluminum and security printing services businesses. At the close of trading, Honeywell shares were up $0.06 to $37.21."
