        "text": "Temperature Control - Building Automation\n\nFire Alarm & Life Safety\n\nPower Distribution\n\nJNS Power's skilled industrial electrical technicians are trained to perform routine and emergency maintenance of industrial electrical power systems and equipment. Our experience encompasses projects for new construction, shutdowns, capital expansions, plant relocations, and contract maintenance services to clients throughout the Chicago area.\n\nDesign Build\n\nJNS Power Project Managers are experienced in working with design team architects and engineers to develop electrical systems within the established budget, without compromising the electrical system by inferior materials or unsafe practices. We can produce detailed electrical installation documents on CAD that are coordinated with similar documents prepared by other trades to reduce conflicts during construction.\n\nCommercial Construction\n\nFrom million dollar projects to small office build-outs, JNS Power has the experience, knowledge, manpower and equipment to suit your needs. Whether it's an engineered project or as part of a design-build team, we can be counted on for timely completion, efficient cost control and exceptional project management.\n\nData & Communication Cabling\n\nWe realize how critical your data and communication networks are to your business or home. Therefore, our goal is to ensure that the cabling products that we install will fulfill your expectations for your network's performance, will be a reliable and consistent resource for you in the future. Our technicians are trained and certified to ensure that our installations will conform to the most widely recognized cabling guidelines.\n\nLighting Control\n\nDigital lighting control offers unparalleled performance, flexibility and simplicity. It enables architects and designers to create high-performance lighting that's perfectly matched to the needs of a building's occupants. It incorporates an electronic database that manages lighting information from the design stage through installation, commissioning and operation, so building owners can be assured that the system works the way it was designed. And when occupant needs change whether it happens every day or every few years an intuitive software interface makes it easy for the facility manager to quickly reconfigure the system to keep it optimized.\n\nSolar Power System Installation\n\nChoose JNS Power for your home Solar needs. We provide start to finish project management by solar panel installation professionals who are licensed and insured. Complete handling of all installation related paperwork - we take care of applying for and processing all permits, tax credits and coordination with your power company. Premium quality solar systems with the most efficient photovoltaic (PV) solar panel modules in the nation, certified to UL standards and warranted for 25 years.\n\nElectric Vehicle Charging Stations\n\nJNS Power will install your electric vehicle charging station either for commercial or residential applications. Although most rechargeable electric vehicles can be recharged from a domestic wall socket, there is a growing need for widely distributed publicly accessible power points some of which support faster charging at higher voltages and currents than are available from domestic supply. In SAE terminology, 240 Volt AC charging is known as level 2 Charging, and 500 Volt DC high-current charging is known as DC Fast Charging. Owners can install a level 2 charging station at home, while businesses and local government provide level 2 and DC Fast Charge public charging stations that supply electricity for a fee or free.\n\nWind Turbine Power Installation\n\nJNS Power can perform electrical power design, installation and termination services for wind turbines these are a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used to produce electricity, the device may be called a wind generator or wind charger. Developed for over a millennium, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a range of vertical and horizontal axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging or auxiliary power; while large grid-connected arrays of turbines are becoming an increasingly large source of commercial electric power."
