        "text": "COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL Air Conditioning & Refrigeration\n\nHVAC Green\n\nMcMullen understands the impact of our business on the environment and its costs. We are always looking for ways to help our customers reduce costs and manage their energy consumption and emissions. It is our goal to minimize the carbon footprint for McMullen and the organizations we serve. . The following Green Practices are performed daily at McMullen Air Conditioning:\n\nWe have begun leasing more energy efficient service vehicles, like the Ford Transit\n\nGPS Tracking for all our fleet reduces fuel cost and consumption\n\nRegular maintenance inspections for our fleet ensure each vehicle is running as efficiently as possible\n\nOur recently implemented electronic service dispatch reduces our paper consumption\n\nMcMullen has an office recycling program where we recycle paper, aluminum, plastics and cardboard\n\nMcMullen promotes duct sealing and proper maintenance to help customers reduce cooling and heating cost and consumption\n\nWe employ an EPA recovery program for Freon gasses, which reduces greenhouse effects on the environment. All of our techs are certified and carry EPA cards\n\nWe promote high efficiency air-conditioning systems to our customers, as well as all tax incentives offered to the public to help promote higher efficiency systems replacements\n\nMost HVAC systems are designed to supply ventilated air based on assumed, rather than actual occupancy. This often results in over-ventilation, wasting both money and energy. McMullen promotes demand ventilation for office buildings to meet ASHRAE 62.99\n\nTeaming our innovative combination temperature/CO2 sensor with proven controls allows you to design systems capable of meeting exact occupancy requirements while saving up to 20% of operating costs\n\nWe install Merv 8 filters during construction projects where applicable; to meet clean air standards\n\nMcMullen installs and promotes The Guardian Air by RGF, which is designed to eliminate sick building syndrome risks by reducing odors, air pollutants, VOCs (chemical odors), smoke, mold bacteria and viruses. The HVAC-PHI Cells are easily mounted into air conditioning and heating systems air ducts where most sick building problems start. When the HVAC system is in operation the HVAC-PHI Cell creates an Advanced Oxidation Process consisting of: Hydro-peroxides, super oxide ions and hydroxide ions. All are friendly oxidizers - oxidizers that revert back to oxygen and hydrogen after the oxidation of the pollutant\n\nWe promote the use of programmable thermostats where building control systems are not in use. Properly using a programmable thermostat in your home or business is one of the easiest ways you can save energy, money, and help fight global warming\n\nMcMullen installs Novar and Honeywell building control systems. A Building Control System can optimize climate comfort and lighting while decreasing the overall runtime of your equipment, lowering total energy consumption. Temperature set points for individual zones combined with electronic sensors ensure precise delivery of climate control and lighting where and when it is desired. Control schemes saving energy include economizer modes utilizing outside air when suitable, chiller lockout on low ambient days, and unoccupied and night setback settings to adjust temperature set points when building occupancy is low. Morning warm-up includes a learning algorithm that allows for the system to optimize the time to reach occupied set points, minimizing heating or cooling during unoccupied times of day"
