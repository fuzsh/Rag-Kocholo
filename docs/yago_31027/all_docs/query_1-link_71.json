        "text": "John Cleese has revived his famous hotelier Basil Fawlty for a TV advert, 36 years after Fawlty Towers ended.\n\nCleese has recreated the 1975 scene in which a frustrated Fawlty berated his broken down car, external before giving it a \"damn good thrashing\" with a branch.\n\nCleese agreed to rewrite the scene for Specsavers opticians as he thought it would be \"genuinely funny\".\n\nThe ad sees Fawlty lose his patience with a sat-nav and take out his anger on the wrong target - a police car.\n\n\"A lot of people have sent me Fawlty Towers scripts, or Basil scripts, and they were always absolutely awful,\" Cleese said.\n\n\"But these people had an idea, and I have to say, I met them and they were all very nice, and within 20 minutes we'd written the script. Because it was kind of obvious. And I looked at that, and I thought, no I think that will work and it's genuinely funny.\""
