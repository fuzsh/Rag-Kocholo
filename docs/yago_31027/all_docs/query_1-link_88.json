        "text": "John Cleese, below, an original cast member of “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” is bringing “an evening of well-honed anecdotes” and “details of recent surgical procedures and unprovoked attacks on former colleagues, especially Michael Palin,” to Britain next year, in what he calls “The Alimony Tour,” he told the BBC News. The show will chronicle his divorce from his third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, in 2008, which culminated in a settlement reported to be more than $17 million. The tour is planned to begin in May of next year in Cambridge, with shows in Birmingham, Salford, Liverpool, Oxford, Leeds, Edinburgh and Bristol. ... Though the regional debut of the musical stage adaptation of “Heathers,” the 1988 cult film starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, has been postponed, producers will offer a concert staging in New York in September, Playbill.com reported. The composer Laurence O’Keefe (“Legally Blonde”), who wrote the book and music with Kevin Murphy (“Reefer Madness”), said he could not confirm casting for the concert but said it would be full of “surprises” and “special guests.” Andy Fickman, another “Reefer Madness” alum, will direct the production, the dates and location of which are still to be determined."
