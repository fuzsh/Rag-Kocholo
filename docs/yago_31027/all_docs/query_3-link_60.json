        "text": "John Cleese tells Roz Laws why he’s working so hard to pay off his ex-wife in a flying visit to Birmingham\n\nJohn Cleese leans forward in his chair and lets me in on a secret – how to get rich (fairly) quick.\n\nFor the first time in our conversation, the laid back Monty Python star looks animated. And sounds just a touch bitter as he explains his money-making scheme.\n\nThat’s because he wasn’t the one to benefit from it. It was his third wife who pocketed millions, and unfortunately from his pocket.\n\n“Seriously, if you want to get rich, go to California, marry somebody rich, spend as much money as you can to establish a high standard of living, stop working so you have to totally depend on them and then get divorced four years later,” says the 71-year-old.\n\n“My sense of resentment is directed towards the insanity of Californian marital law. It annoys me that in my seventies I am having to live in a way I don’t choose to live.\n\n“With my first two divorces, I offered what my wives thought were generous financial settlements and the lawyers barely got involved.\n\n“Alyce Faye decided, for reasons I have never understood, to use the nastiest lawyer around. This woman, Jacqueline Misho, is so ruthless. It is her policy to make whole process as unpleasant as she can.\n\n“Once I realise she had declared war, there was nothing I could do except to conduct a sort of rear-guard action.\n\n“But I think my lawyer wasn’t terribly good. I think he had been, but he’s my age and perhaps a little over the hill. He seemed to be caught on the wrong foot.”\n\nTimes are so tough in the Cleese household that he’s taking to stand-up comedy. After honing the act touring Scandinavia, he’s taking his Alimony Tour on the road in the UK, with three dates at the Birmingham Hippodrome.\n\nIt is to pay for his third divorce from psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. A Californian judge ordered him to pay her $13 million (£8.3 million) upfront and $1 million (£640,000) every year for seven years.\n\nHe has sold off most of his five properties around the world – including a beach house, an office and 15 acre ranch in Montecito, California, a New York flat and a mews house in Holland Park, London.\n\nNow he has three homes, a ‘tiny’ flat in London off Sloane Square which he has just acquired, one in Bath and a flat in San Francisco.\n\n“When I was married to Alice Faye, I had a ridiculously high standard of living,” admits John, who now lives with his girlfriend Jennifer Wade, a jeweller 32 years his junior.\n\n“I have gone from a very expensive lifestyle to a very neat and enjoyable one. I have no real sense of loss, I don’t think ‘oh gosh, how I miss my 15 acre ranch. I liked it at the time but it’s now history and I have all I need.\n\n“But the divorce settlement absolutely effects every decision I make professionally.\n\n“I have to earn $1 million a year before I even get to keep a penny. I have to build my professional choices around that fact.\n\n“I would have been doing much more writing and much less performing if I didn’t have the settlement to consider.\n\n“But at the same time, if you have to earn money, then earning it in this way is about as pleasant a way as you can.”\n\nIt is, perhaps, slightly more pleasant than doing television adverts for the AA’s home emergency service, another recent source of income. In the commercials, he suffers the indignity of having to jump around in a tightly zipped-up sleeping bag while discussing ‘faulty showers’.\n\nSo where does he draw the line when it comes to taking work?\n\n“Oh, there is always a filter,” he agrees. “I call it the EQ – the embarrassment quota. I will only do embarrassing things if there is a lot of money involved and people won’t really know about it.\n\n“But I am very happy to do the commercials for the AA because I think it’s an extraordinarily impressive organisation and has been for decades.\n\n“Some people ask me to do ads and I think ‘I don’t really want to sell potato crisps’.\n\n“I was asked to do a reality show a few months ago. I forget which, it might have been the jungle one or perhaps Celebrity Root Canal!\n\n“I just laughed, then asked how much they were offering out of curiosity. It was £200,000 but I would never agree to one of those shows. That would mean the collapse of western civilisation.\n\n“When I was growing up, we had the best television in the world. Now it’s as bad as it is everywhere else, and I don’t particularly want to participate in that.”\n\nHis Alimony Tour show seems cathartic, as he spends part of the first half making barbed jokes about marriage and divorce, such as: “Imagine how much I’d have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship – such as children or a conversation.”\n\nThe second half is devoted more to anecdotes about his rich and varied career, from Monty Python to Fawlty Towers and working with the likes of Peter Sellers and David Niven.\n\n“The idea of doing a stand-up show came in 2005,” he remembers. “I was so fed up of working on film scripts for Hollywood studios that they really didn’t understand.\n\n“They would tell me to do things to the script that I knew were wrong. It irritated me.\n\n“Someone asked me to do a tour of New Zealand, which appealed to me because it didn’t matter how bad it was – New Zealand is as far away as you can get while staying on the planet.\n\n“And I would have total control over the material, with no Hollywood executive saying I had to change the ending.\n\n“We experimented and the show was pretty good by the time we finished.\n\n“Then an impresario from Oslo asked me to do it in Scandinavia and I toured Norway, Sweden and Denmark, where they all speak such good English.\n\n“It was very successful – the Norwegians have masses of money because of the oil – and I found it fun to do.\n\n“Now I am honing it for the English market. I’ll incorporate more jokes about the class system, for example.\n\n“And I am cutting some stuff out. I’ve already cut it down from a 57 minute first half to a 50 minute, and it’s noticeably better. It just speeds along.\n\n“The great mistake that some stand-ups make is going on too long. The ideal length for a show is 50 minutes for the first half and 47 minutes for the second, that’s what people enjoy. I heard about Ken Dodd going on for four and a half hours – that’s ridiculous, people can’t sit in the theatre for that amount of time!\n\n“Making people laugh is wonderful and so energising. I come off stage and don’t feel at all tired – at least at first!”\n\nJohn does, however, admit to beginning to feel his age a little. Bounding about the stage can take its toll when you have a new knee.\n\n“I had a total knee replacement last year, which is what they call a ‘less intrusive’ procedure in California,” he reveals. “I don’t know how they can say that’s in the slightest bit unintrusive! It’s a tremendous operation.\n\n“It’s an absolute bugger, eight months later I am still limping while going down stairs and holding on to the bannister. But I will be fine by the time the tour starts in May and it will be nice not to feel quite so inhibited on stage.\n\n“I had [the digestive problem] diverticulitis five years ago, which was no fun. That was a big operation. I had a hip replacement in 1999 and my teeth are all new – I had absolutely terrible teeth, a typical war baby. I have things screwed into the bone of my jaw.”\n\nDuring his flying visit to the city, John dropped by the Birmingham Hippodrome to check out the theatre and was pleasantly surprised.\n\n“It’s a great theatre. My spirits were lifted by the sheer beauty of it the minute I walked in.\n\n“I don’t know the city at all well. I came here once with an actress girlfriend in the 1970s because she was in a show in Birmingham. And the Python tour played here in 1973.\n\n“But I can’t say I’ve been back since.\n\n“I am very familiar with the accent, though, as I grew up in Weston-super-Mare, which is like Birmingham-on-Sea. The city used to flock there in huge numbers.\n\n“And Eric Idle, who grew up in the Midlands, used to do a Brummie accent to make us laugh.\n\n“He’d say ‘And now, racing from Birmingham. And who wouldn’t be racing from Birmingham?’.”"
