        "text": "John Cleese has taken a subtle swipe at his ex-wives while singing the praises of his current spouse.\n\nIn a chat with My Weekly, the Monty Python legend described his wife, Jennifer Wade, 52 as a \"wonderfully playful woman.\"\n\nThe Fawlty Towers star, who tied the knot with Wade in 2012, said it \"changes you\" when you \"have someone who really loves you\" before adding a sutble dig at previous spouses, saying: \"I haven't had that experience before.\"\n\nThe 84-year-old actor has been open about his three previous marriages, reportedly shelling out £25million on divorce settlements. He's even humorously claimed that his ex-wives \"cause most of the misery in the world\".\n\nSpeaking on the Conan O'Brien show in the US in 2016, he said: \"I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives.\"\n\nReferring to his second wife, Barbara Threntham, he added: \"One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, the comic disclosed that his split from Alyce Faye Eichelberger, 79, in 2008, resulted in a $20million (£16million) payout. Cleese revealed that when he met her, he owned a \"beautiful house in Holland Park\", but post-break-up, he \"had a flat in Sloane Square.\"\n\nCleese tied the knot with Alyce in 1992, two years after parting ways with his second wife, Barbara Trentham, who he was married to for a decade. His first marriage was to Connie Booth, which lasted from 1968 to 1978.\n\nThe Fawlty Towers star, known for courting controversy, previously launched a 10-part series on GB News titled The Dinosaur Hour. In it, he aims to \"discuss woke issues\" with those considered \"the unfashionable and out-of-touch.\"\n\nGuests lined up for the show included big names like Stephen Fry, Caitlin Jenner, and Trevor McDonald."
