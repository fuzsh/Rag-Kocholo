        "text": "Monty Python star John Cleese has said he wished his ex-wives were dead and hoped a falling tree would kill them.\n\nThe comic has paid out more than £25 million in divorce settlements to his three former spouses although it failed to stop him walking down the aisle again four years ago.\n\nIt was clear the payouts had left Cleese extremely bitter when he appeared on US chat Conan O’Brien alongside his comedy partner Eric Idle, where the two were discussing the secrets to a long-lasting marriage.\n\nBut it was not just his ex-wives who were on the receiving end of his acid tongue.\n\nThe 77-year-old he wished he had never had his two daughters, Camilla and Cynthia Cleese, after they turned out like their mothers.\n\n“I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives,” he said before referring to his second wife Barbara Threntham, who died from complications of leukaemia in 2013.\n\n“One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one,” said Cleese, who is currently married to Jennifer Wade who is 32 years his junior.\n\nAs the host laughed, he asked: “Do you have any real anger or hatred towards your ex-wives?’\n\nCleese then let rip at Connie Booth and Alyce Eichelberger.\n\n“No, I mean, I am quite happy if one or two of them would be dead. But I don’t have anything against them as people.\n\n“I wish them dead in the nicest possible way.\n\n“Not dead in a slow agonising death over a number of years. Something quick like a tree falling on them.”\n\nIn 2011 Cleese famously was forced back on the road with his Alimony Tour to fund his bitter divorce with American psychotherapist Eichelberger.\n\nTwo years ago he spoke about court battle saying: “She went after me really quite brutally by hiring the nastiest - and I don’t mean the second nastiest or the third nastiest - but the nastiest lawyer in Santa Barbara.\n\n“My wife went and hired this really nasty woman and I had to give her $20 million (£16 million). It’s not fair.”\n\nWhile on O’Brien’s show Cleese went on to attack his daughters.\n\n“I think the secret is not to have children,” he added.\n\n“Children are the cause of most of the misery in the world.\n\n“They cost you a fortune, you worry yourself sick and then they grow up like their mothers. Cats are the answer. You can feed them twice a day.”\n\nCynthia was born in 1971 when Cleese was married to his Faulty Tower’s co-star Booth.\n\nHe then had his second daughter 13 years later with Threntham.\n\nThe actor, who is in the States with Idle to promote their north American two-man comedy tour ‘Together Again at Last... For the First Time’, also hit out at Donald Trump.\n\n“Some people ask, ‘What things can’t you make jokes about?’ I think it is difficult to make jokes about this as there is a sense of hopelessness,” she said.\n\n“I mean, what do you do with the oldest guy who has ever been elected, who is clearly unqualified for the job?”"
