        "text": "He joked: “I’ve found someone who is very age inappropriate. Jenny is 39 – which is 31 years difference – which is a disgrace.\n\n“We’ve only been together three or four months – but she is the most... playful creature. One thing we know about Jenny is, she’s not after my money.”\n\nThe ‘Monty Python’ star is currently on a comedy tour in Europe, and claims it is to fund his divorce settlement.\n\nHe said: “It’s very interesting. What I’ve discovered is that British comedy goes very well in Northern Protestant Europe. I’m doing 25 shows in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\n“I mean people are surprised when I say the figures. When Alyce Faye and I split up she got $13m (€9.85m) and I got to keep $8m (€6.1m). But over the next seven years I have to pay her $1m (€758,195) a year. She needs it!”"
