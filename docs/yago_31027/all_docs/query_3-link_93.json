        "text": "His new wife, Jennifer Wade, is 31 years younger than the 72-year-old Cleese but he said the age difference never bothered the couple.\n\n“I couldn’t imagine being with anyone but Jenny,” the Sun reported him as saying. “And with my record, that’s a remarkable thing to say.”\n\nThe couple were married on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nCleese was previously married to Americans Connie Booth (who he co-wrote Fawlty Towers with) Barbara Trentham and Alyce Faye Eichelberger.\n\nJewellery designer Wade said: “We’re kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it.”\n\nMarriage has been a costly business for Cleese.\n\nSplits from actress Trentham and psychotherapist Eichelburger cost him more than £14million. A US court ruled in 2008 that Eichelberger should get £8m in cash and assets, plus £600,000 per year for seven years, despite the couple having no children.\n\nCleese was forced to go back on the road to meet the bill, in a one-man show he dubbed the ‘Alimony Tour’.\n\n“Basically, I have to find a million dollars a year until I’m 76. You don’t get that sort of money by sitting at home,” Cleese said.\n\n“That I, at my age, would have to plan my life anew to pay her all the money she is to get for the next seven years – well, it irritates me.”\n\nHowever, Cleese told Hello! that the divorce had not put him off marriage entirely.\n\n“The truth is, I’m a romantic,” he said.\n\n“I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage – the only thing was my ability to choose the right person.\n\nCleese’s Monty Python pal Terry Gilliam said last year: “If he marries again, he is stupid. Each time they get younger.”"
