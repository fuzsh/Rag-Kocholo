        "text": "John Cleese: ‘Surprising Poverty’ Motivates Him to Continue Working Despite His Age\n\nResidual Effects of Divorce\n\nAt 84 years of age, legendary comedian and actor John Cleese has no plans to retire anytime soon. One of the driving forces behind his continued work is the financial impact of his third divorce in 2008 from psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. Cleese has described the settlement, which amounted to $20 million (£16 million), as “absurd.”\n\n‘Alimony Tour’ and Financial Struggles\n\nIn the aftermath of the divorce, Cleese embarked on a “Alimony Tour” to make up for the lost funds. Despite these efforts, he has stated that he is still experiencing financial difficulties. “I’m surprisingly poor,” Cleese told SagaMagazine. “I never thought it was necessary to own a great deal.”\n\nUnderlying Resentment\n\nWhile Cleese claims to have moved on from the anger of the divorce, he admits that the absurdity of the settlement still motivates him. “How they figured out she was worth $20m, I have no idea,” he commented.\n\nWealth Distribution and Material Possessions\n\nDespite his estimated net worth of around £20 million, Cleese does not own a car or property. He has transferred the short lease of his flat to his current wife, Jennifer Wade. Cleese’s wealth largely stems from his long-standing involvement with the Monty Python comedy group.\n\nFawlty Towers Reboot and Controversy\n\nCleese is currently involved in a revival of the classic BBC comedy series “Fawlty Towers,” in which he played the eccentric hotelier Basil Fawlty. His daughter, Camilla, is co-writing the two-hour stage show. However, the reboot has been met with controversy, as Cleese’s ex-wife, Connie Booth, claims she was not informed about the project.\n\nPerspective on Wealth and Happiness\n\nCleese’s financial struggles have led him to a philosophical perspective on wealth. “The most important thing is to have enough money to have some really good food, buy clothes twice a year and have nice holidays,” he said.\n\nConclusion\n\nJohn Cleese’s continued work despite his age and financial difficulties is a testament to his determination and the lingering impact of his divorce settlement. Through his work, he is able to both express his creative talents and address the financial challenges he faces."
