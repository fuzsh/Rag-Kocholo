        "text": "John Cleese clashes with BBC World News interviewer\n\nJohn Cleese is due to be returning to our screens in his famous role as Basil Fawlty as Fawlty Towers is set for a reboot. The Monty Python actor will be working alongside his daughter, Camilla, 39, who will also play his offspring on screen. The 83-year-old actor, who has been married four times, told how he was forced to continue working — for seven years in total — in order to pay the alimony following his divorce from psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. The couple went their separate ways in 2008 after 15 years of marriage, a parting that came with a hefty price tag. Cleese spent a staggering £12million on the split, paying out £650,000 a year to his ex in what he described as “feeding the beast”.\n\nDespite the huge payout sum, Cleese told Spiegel that he thought Eichelberger was now better off than he was.\n\nHe said: “I was comfortably well off before I got divorced from Alyce Faye Eichelberger. I never knew how much I really had — I was just comfortable.\n\nBut now I've been working for seven years to pay off the alimony. She's far better off than I am. So you could sit around being bitter about that. Or you can just think it's completely ridiculous.”\n\nHe told the German weekly news magazine that he would be making his final payment in the summer of 2015. Now, seven years on, the Monty Python star is in his early Eighties and still hard at work.\n\nIn 2021, he starred in the Clifford the Big Red Dog movie playing Mr Bridwell.\n\nBritons face 'winter catastrophe' as prepay meter energy bills could hit £700 in months\n\nHouseholds using prepayment meters could end up paying over £700 a month for their energy bills come October 1.\n\nWith costs due to rise even more, typical energy bills in January alone could hit £714 – which could be over half of someone’s monthly disposable income.\n\nRead more HERE.\n\nCleese said as much as he wants to sit back and read “a lot of books”, he must work as he has no savings up his sleeve.\n\nSpeaking on LBC's Full Disclosure podcast in August, he was asked at what point in his life he had become satisfied, to which he replied: “[I’m] looking forward to [becoming satisfied].\n\n“There are so many books I want to read, but the divorce did absolutely clean me out because I never had the sort of money that people who worked in American television had.\n\n“It cleaned me out so I’m still working and I’m nearly 83. And I’m still working and I don’t really have any savings.”\n\nREAD MORE: John Cleese heartbreak over wife's debilitating conditions laid bare.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They both make me laugh more than anyone else. And I will just read a lot and try and understand what this thing life is all about.”\n\nHowever, he is now due to star alongside his daughter in the Fawlty Towers reboot which will centre around Basil navigating the modern world, having also discovered that he has a daughter.\n\nDON'T MISS: Piers Morgan responds to Meghan Markle's child privacy concerns [REPORT]Darius Campbell Danesh's serious health battles prior to his death [LATEST]\n\nPutin issued urgent warning as Kremlin war machine grinds to a halt [INSIGHT]\n\nCleese – who was also previously married to his Fawlty Towers co-star Connie Booth – is now married to jewellery designer, Jennifer Wade. Four years after his divorce from Ms Eichelberger, the couple tied the knot at an intimate ceremony on the Caribbean island, Mustique.\n\nHe told Hello! Magazine in 2012: “We’re kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it.\n\n“I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage – the only thing wrong was my ability to choose the right person.\n\n“I couldn’t imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now. And with my record, that’s a pretty remarkable thing to say.”"
