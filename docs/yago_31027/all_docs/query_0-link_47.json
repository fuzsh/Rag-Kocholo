        "text": "Monty Python’s John Cleese probably isn’t looking at the bright side of life right now. Although his divorce from Alyce Faye Eichelberger finally became official last week, it’s going to cost him dearly.\n\nThe divorce was finalized on August 18 at Santa Barbara Superior Court in California. According to Cleese’s London representative, the British comic has to pay Eichelberger a total of $12 million in cash and assets, plus spousal support of $918,000 a year for the next seven years.\n\nThe payout includes the couple’s New York City apartment, a property they owned in London, and a share in their California beach house.\n\n“The papers have been lodged, and everything is agreed,” Cleese’s rep told Reuters after the court settlement. “It’s now just a formality.”\n\nEichelberger, 64, originally had demanded half of Cleese’s income since their marriage, along with half of his properties and $900,000 in annual support. A judge called these requests “excessive” in March.\n\nCleese, however, is very unhappy with the final outcome, claiming that the settlement will make her wealthier than he. “What I find so unfair,” he told the British media last week, as quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, “is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine… At least I will know in future, if I go out with a lady, they will not be after me for my money.”\n\nThis was the third marriage and divorce for Cleese, 69. He married Eichelberger in 1992; they have no children together.\n\nJohn Cleese rose to international stardom with the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe in the 1970s. He also starred as misanthropic hotelier Basil Fawlty in the classic Britcom Fawlty Towers, and his films include A Fish Called Wanda, Time Bandits and two of the Harry Potter series. He is reportedly working on an upcoming tour called John Cleese: A Final Wave at the World, or The Alimony Tour, Year One."
