        "text": "\"Monty Python\" actor John Cleese is doing everything he can to fund his pricey 2008 divorce from Alyce Faye Eichelberger.\n\nFirst, the British funnyman launched a stand-up comedy \"Alimony Tour,\" then he moved to Monaco to skirt high tax rates and now he is selling his TV and film memorabilia to pay for his multi-million dollar split, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe items will be sold on the Original Memorabilia Company website and include props such as a fiberglass helmet from \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" as well as signed photographs from famous \"Monty Python\" and \"Fawlty Towers\" sketches.\n\nCleese and Eichelberger -- an American psychotherapist -- divorced in 2008 after 16 years of marriage. Their 2009 divorce settlement stipulated that he pay his ex-wife $13 million in cash and assets, and nearly $1 million a year until 2016. The former couple has no children.\n\nCleese married his fourth wife, Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years his junior, in August 2012. He was previously married to Connie Booth, Barbara Trentham and Eichelbeger.\n\nClick through the slideshow below to see photos of the \"Monty Python\" cast over the years."
