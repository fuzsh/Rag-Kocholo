        "text": "1. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\n\nJohnny Depp auctioned off million of dollars worth of paintings amid his messy divorce from Amber Heard. Mr. Depp offloaded nine paintings by Basquiat, which he has collected over the past 25 years, and the pieces went under the hammer at Christie’s auction house in London. Apparently there was no prenup and Ms. Heard accused Mr. Depp of physical and mental abuse. Legal proceedings are still in the making.\n\n2. Anne Dias and Kenneth C. Griffin\n\nEven the memory of their lavish wedding in Versailles couldn’t save these two ambitious hedge fund managers from having to divide up their enviable art collection. Mr. Griffin, head of $20 billion investment firm Citadel, filed a divorce petition citing “irreconcilable differences” with his wife of 11 years. Ms. Dias Griffin, 43, fired back claiming to have been “blindsided” by the move. One of their first dates was in an art gallery and their marriage left a more permanent mark on the architecture of Chicago where the modern art wing of the Art Institute of Chicago features Griffin Court, a Renzo Piano-designed wing built after a $19 million donation from the couple. They were ranked by ArtNews as two of the most active collectors of art with a focus on Post-Impressionist works. Their collection included Jasper Johns’s “False Start,” which they acquired from media mogul David Geffen for $80 million, as well as pieces by Cézanne and Monet.\n\nOne of the most powerful Democratic couples, super-lobbyists and prominent socialites of the art world, Heather and Tony Podesta, initially bickered over the division of their art collection. The Australian Embassy in DC had readied its gallery for a nine-week exhibition featuring artist Patricia Piccinini, however, two weeks before it was to open, the Washington couple couldn’t come to an agreement and the show was cancelled. During their 11 year marriage they acquired over 700 contemporary artworks including sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, photographs by Katy Grannan and Shepard Fairey’s “Hope” portrait of Barack Obama. Eventually they came to an amicable settlement over their collection and their brand."
