        "text": "John Cleese has paid his third ex-wife almost $20 million.\n\nJohn Cleese\n\nThe 75-year-old actor, who split from American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 2008 after 16 years of marriage, claims he has \"been working for seven years\" to pay for their divorce settlement and she is much \"better off\" than him now.\n\nHe said: \"I was comfortably well off before I got divorced from Alyce Faye Eichelberger. I never knew how much I really had -- I was just comfortable. But now I've been working for seven years to pay off the alimony.\"\n\nBut John insists he isn't bitter about the money.\n\nThe 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' star said: \"She's far better off than I am. So you could sit around being bitter about that. Or you can just think it's completely ridiculous.\n\n\"In July I will make the last payment and then I will have given her $20 million.\n\n\"When we broke up, there were five properties. Now I have one very nice flat left in London, just around the corner. I don't need anything else.\"\n\nAsked what his biggest regret is in life, he told Germany's Spiegel Online: \"My third marriage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the 'Faulty Towers' actor, who married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade in 2012, admits he wishes German was his first language.\n\nHe said: \"I don't know too many words in German, but my accent is quite good. I had a dream ten years ago that I was in a room with three men wearing gray suits, probably psychiatrists. And just before I woke up, I said to them, my main regret in life is that German is not my first language. At the time it told me that I should take some time off, go to Germany and learn the language properly.\""
