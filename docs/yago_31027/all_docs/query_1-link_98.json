        "text": "Given he's on a third divorce, John Cleese is hardly talking from a position of strength with his views on marriage.\n\nBut the Fawlty Towers star has argued that wedding licences should be regularly renewed - like dog licences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for becoming parents, the father-of-two said couples should have to pass tests before being able to have a child.\n\nAsked whether he would have liked to have spent the past 40 years with one woman, the 68 year old comedian replied: ' No. I think it should be like dog licences.\n\n' I think you should have to renew marriage licences every five years, unless you have children.\n\n' And I think before you have children you should have to go and pass various tests and get a licence to have a child. Because it's the most transformative and difficult thing of your life.'\n\nThe former Monty Python star also revealed that he must keep working to help fund the acrimonious, and expensive, divorce from his third wife, American-born psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'People would think I'd have enough money, but I do have a very expensive, or comparatively expensive, divorce,' he said.\n\n' When I divorced Barbara (Trentham, his second wife) in about '88 that cost me £2.5 million then.\n\n'And now this divorce with Alyce Faye - I mean, I'm paying more than £1 million a year right now. And we never had children.\n\n' When I got divorced from Connie (Booth, wife one) ....and when I got divorced from Barbara, I didn't need lawyers on either occasion, because I just sort of said: \"Why don't I give you this?\" And they said : \"That's very fair, very generous. Thank you.\" End of story.\n\n'This woman now was asking my old St John's Wood accountants for 60 boxes of documents, so many documents that they had to send people out from California to go through them.'"
