        "text": "John Cleese is happy to be single again at nearly 70 years old, but resents having to pay millions to divorce his third wife.\n\nThe 69-year-old, facing an expensive divorce from psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger, voiced anger at the over one million pounds ($2.4 million) a year he has to pay to \"feed the beast.\"\n\n\"People would think I'd have enough money, but I do have a very expensive, or comparatively expensive, divorce,\" he told The Times newspaper.\n\n\"I feel angry sometimes. But my anger is not so much about sharing the property but having to go on working hard to provide alimony for someone who's already going to have at least 10 million dollars worth of property.\"\n\nThe British comedian, who lives in California, shot to international fame in the late 1960s and 1970s as a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe.\n\nHe was married twice before - to actress Connie Booth, who co-starred in the hit 1970s comedy series Fawlty Towers, and actress Barbara Trentham, with whom he split in the late 1980s.\n\nBut the actor said his divorce from Eichelberger is proving the most difficult, as she has refused an offer to try to settle amicably.\n\n\"At some point you say, 'Well, what did I do wrong? You know, I was the breadwinner.' The system is insane.\"\n\nAnd he lamented: \"In my 70th year I will still be spending two months a year doing work that is of no interest to me and which is probably slightly spiritually depleting in order to feed the beast.\"\n\nOverall though he said he is happy - and played down press reports that he has a new girlfriend, 34-year-old Veronica Smiley.\n\n\"Oh, Smiley's great fun ... But that all got blown up,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to have to start being unselfish again. The great thing about being on your own is you do what you damn well like.\n\n\"This is the happiest I have ever been and I feel that ... now I want as many years as I can get,\" he added."
