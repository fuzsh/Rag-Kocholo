        "text": "British comedian John Cleese gets serious when speaking about his third wife, Oklahoma-born shrink Alyce Faye Cleese, whom he calls his ticket to sanity.\n\n“I realized that, basically, my doctor prescribed Alyce,” says John, who met her through the therapist he was seeing following the breakup of his second marriage.\n\nNow, the prescription is available for the rest of us, too, as Faye Cleese dispenses advice in “How to Manage your Mother,” a book in which she and co-author Brian Bates focus on this most complicated relationship.\n\nAnd just in time for Mother’s Day.\n\n“It was a love song for my mother,” Faye Cleese said in an interview with The Post.\n\n“She died when I was 16, but somehow she managed to give me the internal strength that got me through many things in my life.”\n\nIt would appear the esteemed Jungian psychoanalyst has gleaned a thing or two from Monty Python’s erstwhile Minister of Silly Walks — the book offers many mom-from-hell and mom-from-heaven anecdotes from stars.\n\nAmong the glitterati who weigh with tales are Lauren Hutton, Mia Farrow, Mike Nichols, Helena Bonham Carter, Hugh Hefner and Arianna Huffington.\n\nThe result is a fun, if not exactly scholarly, read.\n\n“We realize that some of our professional colleagues might wish for more psychoanalytic theory or empirical research literature,” writes Faye Cleese in the introduction of her book.\n\nHow can you improve your relationship with your mother? “The important thing to remember is that as an adult, we often stay children in our minds when it comes to our moms,” Faye Cleese says. “We never let our mother grow up, and we never grow up.”\n\nEducated at Oklahoma State, Baylor and London universities, Alice Faye married golf pro David Eichelberger, with whom she has two sons — Martin, 30, and Clinton, 27 — and now, three grandchildren.\n\nShe met Cleese years after the breakup of her own marriage on a blind date arranged by Cleese’s shrink in 1989.\n\nThe couple married in 1992, a union blessed with a happy blend of the serious and the absurd. For her 50th birthday, Cleese threw his wife a party at the Freud Museum in Hampstead, England.\n\nThe Mom Problem seemed a natural one to tackle, she says. And she credits her husband for goading her into writing the book.\n\n“The only reason I wrote it is that John kept repeating like the little engine that could, ‘I think you can. I think you can. I think you can.’ And I did it.”\n\nShe writes in the book that she once believed the only people who needed to talk so much about their mothers were “artists and people who had sought therapeutic help.”\n\n“I was wrong,” she writes. “Gradually over the years I realized that all the people who told me about themselves focused on their mothers.”\n\nJust like:\n\n(-sbull-) Monty Python alum Terry Jones: “I look so much like my mum! Especially when I dress up as a woman!”\n\n(-sbull-) John Cleese: “My mother tends to chatter, and to talk in an almost bewildering sequence of ‘cuts,’ by which you trace every family tree in town, cutting from one family to the next without pause for breath.”\n\n(-sbull-) Hugh Hefner: “Mother maintained a very puritan home . . . Mom did not show affection physically, and did not kiss the children, for fear it might spread germs. And when I reached adolescence, I think my interest in the things that led to Playboy were a reaction.”\n\n(-sbull-) Mike Nichols: From a sketch performed with Elaine May based on a true telephone conversation opener: “This is your mother. Remember me?”"
