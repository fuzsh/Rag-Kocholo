        "text": "Cleese, 69, has been forced into agreeing to a settlement worth £8m (€9.4m) in cash and assets, alongside £612,000 (€716,000) annually for the next seven years.\n\nIt is estimated he will be left with a fortune of around £10m (€11.7m).\n\nJoking about the decision, Cleese said: \"I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay if she'd contributed anything!”\n\nIn support of the comic star, his film director friend Michael Winner said: \"The result is extraordinary. Alyce lived in a council flat when they met.\n\n“As he put it: ‘What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine.’\n\n\"There are no dependant children. If ever there was a case for prenuptial agreements, this is it.\"\n\nCleese has two adult children, Cynthia and Camilla, from his marriages to actresses Connie Booth and Barbara Trentham respectively, while Eichelberger has two sons from her previous marriage.\n\nThe settlement marks the end of a 19-month battle for the ‘Life of Brian’ actor and his psychotherapist ex-wife, whom he married in 1992.\n\nOriginally Eichelberger had been claiming £900,000 (€1m)-a-year maintenance, two houses and half of all earnings Cleese had amassed during their marriage.\n\nCleese split from Booth and Trentham amicably and without the need for lawyers.\n\nHe previously said of his divorce from Eichelberger: “It's going to be very, very expensive, but it will be worth every penny.”"
