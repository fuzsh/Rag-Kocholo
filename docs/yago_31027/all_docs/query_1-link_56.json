        "text": "John Cleese says he is still working at 84 because he is desperate for a new marital home - away from the spotlight.\n\nThe Fawlty Towers star, 84, has spoken candidly over the years about how his $20million divorce settlement emptied his savings in 2008. And the comedy legend has now admitted he wants to retreat to \"somewhere quiet\" with his fourth wife once he has enough cash.\n\nSpeaking on Chicago station WGN Radio, he revealed: \"What motivates me is money... My third wife cleared me out of $20milllion, now $20million is quite a lot because when you've paid her 10, you've still got 10 to go and then you're paying 50 per cent tax on what you're giving her anyway.\n\n\"So it's cleaned my nest egg out, and I'm now extremely happily married to a wonderfully silly and funny lady and I'd like to go and live somewhere quiet with her for a long time. So that's my aim, that's what I'm after.\"\n\nMonty Python favourite John, who is now married to fourth wife Jennifer Wade, split from psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 2008 after 16 years together. He later slammed the settlement she was awarded in their divorce \"absurd\" and \"ridiculous\", adding: \"How they figured out she was worth $20million, I have no idea.\"\n\nThe year after ruling, John went on to poke fun at his situation by announcing a series of new shows in Scandinavia and the US - which he named The Alimony Tour. The two year tour was later extended to include gigs in the UK. A further tour - John Cleese: Last Time To See Me Before I Die - followed in 2013.\n\nIn a comic press conference later that year, the comic and his fellow Monty Python stars announced a stage reunion in July 2014. And he went on to tour the US with Eric Idle, in a show titled John Cleese and Eric Idle: Together At Last... For The Very First Time. Soon after Fawlty Towers: The Play made its debut in Australia.\n\nLast February also saw the news that John's daughter Camilla would be teaming up with him for a reboot of Fawlty Towers - 44 years after the classic sitcom first aired. The new version will be written by John and star him as TV favourite Basil Fawlty, who will be seen struggling with the modern world.\n\nAsked the series in May, John said: \"There's no point in setting it in Torquay, we've done that. So we're going to set it in the Caribbean. There's going to be much more stuff shot outside the hotel, and you've got all the water sports and all that kind of thing, so we work in all that.\" He went on to add that he is enjoying writing with Camilla - who will play Basil's illegitimate daughter - as she has a \"wicked\" sense of humour.\n\nIn the same month, he was seen cosying up to wife Jennifer, 52, on the red carpet at the opening night of Fawlty Towers: The Play in London's West End. The couple met through mutual friends in 2009 and went on to wed on the Caribbean island of Mustique in August 2012.\n\nSpeaking about their relationship in an interview with Hello! Magazine, John said: \"I knew from the first moment I met her that this could be something very serious. She is an extraordinary one-off. I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage – the only thing wrong was my ability to choose the right person. I couldn’t imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now. And with my record, that’s a pretty remarkable thing to say.\"\n\nJohn was first married to Fawlty Towers co-star Connie Booth in 1968, but the pair split in 1978 and he went on to wed Barbara Trentham before his third marriage to Alyce."
