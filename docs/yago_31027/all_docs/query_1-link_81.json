The 69-year-old British comic recently parted ways with psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. But Cleese said he isn’t happy about the $1.66 million dollars a year he has to pay to support his wife. “I feel angry sometimes. But my anger is not so much about sharing the property but having to go on working hard to provide alimony for someone who’s already going to have at least $10 million worth of property,” the “Monty Python” comic told the Times of London newspaper. It was the actor’s third marriage."
