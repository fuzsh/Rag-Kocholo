        "text": "JOHN Cleese has long been a household name, thanks to his long career as a comedian and actor.\n\nBut over the years the Fawlty Towers star's love life and multiple marriages have dominated the headlines.\n\nWho is Jennifer Wade?\n\nJennifer Wade was born on November 17, 1971, in Bath.\n\nShe is the wife of actor and comedian John Cleese, who is 32 years her senior.\n\nJennifer is a jewellery designer, who used to work as a model.\n\nTogether with John, she splits her time between the UK, America, and the Caribbean.\n\nWhen did John Cleese and Jennifer Wade get married?\n\nThe couple met through mutual friends in 2009.\n\nJohn and Jennifer then went on to say \"I do\" in August 2012.\n\nThey married in an intimate ceremony on Caribbean island Mustique.\n\nDo they have any children?\n\nJohn and Jennifer don't have any children together.\n\nHowever, the actor has two daughters - Camilla and Cynthia - from his previous marriages.\n\nIn February 2023 it was announced that Camilla would be teaming up with her famous father for a reboot of his classic sitcom Fawlty Towers.\n\nWhat has John Cleese said about Jennifer Wade?\n\nIn an interview with Hello! magazine, John talked about meeting wife Jennifer.\n\nHe told the publication: “I knew from the first moment I met her that this could be something very serious.\n\n“She is an extraordinary one-off. I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage – the only thing wrong was my ability to choose the right person.\n\n\"I couldn’t imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now. And with my record, that’s a pretty remarkable thing to say.”\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer told the magazine: “We’re kindred spirits.\n\n\"When people see us together, they immediately get it.”\n\nHow many times has John Cleese been married?\n\nJohn has been married four times during his life.\n\nBefore fourth wife Jennifer, the actor was wed to:\n\nConnie Booth\n\nJohn and his first wife Connie Booth met in the states and married back in 1968.\n\nThe duo later became famous for writing the scripts and starring in both renditions of the sitcom Fawlty Towers.\n\nDuring their marriage they welcomed daughter Cynthia in 1971, before they divorced seven years later in 1978.\n\nCynthia would go on to star alongside her dad in 1983’s A Fish Called Wanda.\n\nBarbara Trentham\n\nAmerican actress Barbara Trentham was the second wife of John.\n\nThey were married in 1981, three years before the birth of their only child Camilla.\n\nThey separated in 1990 but remained on good terms until Barbara's death from leukaemia, aged 68.\n\nAlyce Faye\n\nIn 1992, John married psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger.\n\nThey divorced 16 years later and she walked away with a massive $12million (£10m) in the California-based settlement.\n\nThey didn't have any children together."
