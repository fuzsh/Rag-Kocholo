        "text": "John Cleese is as British as they come. He was born in Somerset, educated at Cambridge University -- where he earned a law degree -- and has a home in London.\n\nHe's also a founding member of Britain's famed Monty Python comedy troupe, for which he's played a slaughtering but apologetic Sir Lancelot and a member of the Ministry of Silly Walks.Yet this Brit who often plays twits has ties to Texas.\n\nCleese is married to the former Alyce Faye Eichelberger, of Waco. And his friend and co-star in the current remake of \"The Out-of-Towners\" is Waco-born Steve Martin.\n\nMartin plays an Ohio ad man in Manhattan with his wife (Goldie Hawn) for a job interview. Everything goes wrong, from losing their luggage to having their credit cards fail at a posh hotel.\n\nWhen they ask the cheerfully rude manager (Cleese) if he'll throw them out, he replies, \"Good heavens, no! Security will take care of that. Security!\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Cleese said the Waco link has come up from time to time in the 10 years he and Martin have known each other.\n\nCleese met Alyce Faye, his third wife (who was once married to pro golfer Dave Eichelberger of Waco) in 1987 in London -- on a blind date.\n\n\"She was prescribed for me by my doctor,\" Cleese said. \"I went to dinner with him, and he said there was a ravishing woman I should meet, and it turned out to be true. We started going out together soon after and married in '92.\"\n\nHe says he's \"not quite sure\" where they live.\n\n\"We have a home in London that's occupied by builders now, and a home in Santa Barbara (Calif.), and I've been traveling around giving speeches, which I rather enjoy. So it's hard to say quite where we're living.\"\n\nCleese tries to keep in touch with his mates from Monty Python.\n\n\"I see quite a lot of Michael Palin, since we're both based in London, but I haven't seen much of Eric Idle since he moved to L.A.,\" Cleese said.\n\nThe funny fellows have been \"exploring\" the possibility of a stage show, \"maybe for Vegas,\" Cleese said. \"But Eric doesn't want to do it, and Terry Gilliam is more interested in directing films than taking a minor part onstage.\"\n\nThe group does plan a fall reunion for a BBC special marking Monty Python's 30th anniversary.\n\n\"They're giving us four hours to be as silly and naughty as we want,\" said Cleese, who thinks the show eventually will air on PBS, where \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" first appeared on American telly in 1974. The TV series was followed by several movie spin-offs, including \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\"\n\nThat twisted tale of knights and shrubbery was made 25 years ago, and Cleese still loves it, \"except for about 15 minutes in the middle that I don't think is very good.\"\n\nCleese can be his own worst critic.\n\n\"The truth is, if you write a funny line for a film, there will be only six times you think it's funny in two years,\" said Cleese, whose screenwriting credits include 1988's \"A Fish Called Wanda.\"\n\nSuch occasions arise during writing, rehearsals, filming \"and when you finally show it to an audience,\" Cleese said.\n\nCleese reunited with \"Wanda\" co-stars Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis for 1997's \"Fierce Creatures,\" a comedy about a failing London zoo, which he also wrote. It didn't click, earning $9 million in America, compared to $63 million for \"Wanda.\"\n\n\"I think it was a mistake to make 'Fierce Creatures' with Kevin and Jamie Lee,\" Cleese said. \"I think if I'd done it with different people, it would have been accepted for what it was, which was not 'A Fish Called Wanda.' It would have been perceived as a different movie -- broader and also warmer.\"\n\n\"The Out-of-Towners\" remakes a 1970 film with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. But Cleese had never heard of the Neil Simon comedy, so for him this new adaptation (by Marc Lawrence) was a fresh start.\n\nCleese hadn't starred with Martin before, and he'd never even met Hawn \"until I was on the set with her.\n\n\"Yet I felt very comfortable, because I really liked the script, I knew Steve, Goldie is such a doll, and I'd worked with the director (Sam Weisman) on other things, including when I did the voice of an ape for 'George of the Jungle.' \"\n\nWhile filming \"The Out-of-Towners\" -- mostly on L.A. sound stages -- Weisman often laughed during takes.\n\n\"Usually you'd kill anyone who did that on a set,\" Cleese said. \"But when it's the director cheering you on, you just say, 'Well, you're right -- it's funny.' And of course you can always loop a line (re-record it in post-production) without having to abandon the whole take.\"\n\nCleese stresses that his new role as Mersault differs from the late-'70s British sitcom \"Fawlty Towers,\" in which he played Basil, manager of a small English country hotel.\n\n\"Mersault is totally different,\" Cleese said. \"Unlike Basil, he's very international, totally sophisticated, obviously has seen it all and doesn't get rattled. He also can be quite charming when he knows you have money.\"\n\nMersault's secret is dressing in drag -- as Cleese often did in his Python days. In one scene, the hotelier dances in a fur coat and 4-inch high heels with a flower in his teeth.\n\nFor the dancing, Cleese had a stunt double who was only 2 inches shorter than his 6-foot-4 height.\n\nEven then, he was \"genuinely anxious\" that he might twist an ankle in the rest of the scene. \"If I had, what do you do? Postpone shooting for three months, I suppose.\n\n\"I've done some athletic moves in my time, such as the Ministry of Silly Walks,\" Cleese said. \"But I'm turning 60 this year, and I don't think I can do that kind of thing anymore.\"\n\nNormally Cleese finds filming \"tedious\" and doesn't enjoy \"any part of it -- drag in particular.\"\n\nYet after finishing his \"Out-of-Towners\" drag scene, \"I have to say it was one of the most pleasant productions I've ever worked on,\" Cleese said. \"There was so much comedy know-how on the set, and working with a good group like that can be quite joyous.\"\n\nHe has done no writing since \"Fierce Creatures,\" except his humorous speeches, and now he won't have time. \"I'll be busy in the next few months getting my finances in order. It's time for my pension.\"\n\nHe also realizes that, \"the way this business is structured -- which is insane -- I could probably make 20 times more by acting in a movie than writing one.\"\n\nCleese's acting has included the films \"Silverado,\" \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" \"Time Bandits\" and Idle's \"Splitting Heirs.\" In the can is the animated \"The Magic Pud-ding,\" for which he supplies a voice.\n\nNow if only Cleese's wife would see his work.\n\n\"She does think I'm pretty funny,\" he said. \"But she hasn't seen many of my movies, actually. Apparently she loves me for who I am, not who I play.\""
