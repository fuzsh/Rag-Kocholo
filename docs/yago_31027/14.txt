John Cleese has been taken to the cleaners by ex-wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger who will waltz out of their marriage with £8million in cash and assets, plus £612,000 a year for the next seven years.

Now I’m all for women getting a fair deal in court, but this payout is insane considering the pair had no children together and it will ultimately leave her kids better off than his.

American psychotherapist Alyce is said to have fought tooth and nail for this deal, which shows just what kind of woman she is.

Cleese, however, has treated his court battering with English humour: “I got off lightly. Think what I’d have had to pay if she’d contributed anything to the relationship.”

He might have lost a fortune, but at least he salvaged the last laugh.
