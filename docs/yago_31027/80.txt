John Cleese is to separate from his wife after 19 years of marriage.

American-born Alyce Faye Eichelberger, a psychotherapist known for her work with children, is the comic actor's third spouse.

A friend insisted that no one else was involved in the split, telling the Daily Telegraph: "They just have felt that the relationship is not going to continue and I think they are very sad but fairly resolved about it."

Cleese, 68, is believed to have become increasingly "melancholy" over the past few months following the deaths of a number of close friends.

The couple had no children together, but have two each from previous marriages.
