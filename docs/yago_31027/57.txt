John Cleese has married his jewellery designer girlfriend Jennifer Wade.

Cleese, 72, and Wade, 41, recently tied the knot on the Caribbean island of Mustique.

This is the fourth wedding for Cleese, who divorced his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger four years ago, and the second marriage for Wade.

"I knew from the first moment we met this could be very serious", Cleese told Hello! magazine of his new wife.

"I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage â€“ the only thing wrong was my ability to choose the right person. I couldn't imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now. And with my record, that's a pretty remarkable thing to say."

Wade added: "We're kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it."

The couple met in 2009 after they were introduced by mutual friends.
