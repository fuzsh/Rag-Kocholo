London, August 18 : John Cleese will give his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger 12 million pounds in divorce settlement.

The 69-year-old actor will reportedly transfer 8 million pounds in cash and assets including homes in London and New York to his US-born former partner.

According to court papers in California, Eichelberger, 64, who had Prince Charles' lawyer Fiona Shackleton representing her in court, will also receive 612,000 pounds a year until 2016.

"What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine," the Daily Express quoted Cleese as saying.

"I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she contributed anything to the relationship," he added.

The former couple tied the knot in 1992 and separated in 2007. (ANI)
