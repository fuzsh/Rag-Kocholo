Located next to Carlisle's shopping district, the Cathedral stands proud in the old and historical part of Carlisle's city centre.\n\nStarting life as a Norman Priory Church in 1122, it became a cathedral in 1133. Notable features include figurative stone carving, a set of medieval choir stalls and the largest window in the 'flowing decorated Gothic' style in England.\n\nThe 900-year-old Cathedral has recently seen the refurbishment of the Fratery and new cafe, both of which are well worth a visit.\n\nCarlisle Castle and Tullie House Museum\n\nThe impressive and imposing Norman-style castle stands proud over Carlisle which it defended for many centuries. It remained a working fortress until well within living memory and was home to the King's Own Royal Border Regiment.\n\nVisit the tower where Mary Queen of Scots was held captive by order of her cousin Queen Elizabeth I. Exhibitions and galleries tell the story of how the castle was held to siege 10 times in its history, making it the most besieged place in the British isles.\n\nIf you are looking for a cultural day out with the family then look no further than Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery. The museum houses a considerable collection of fine and decorative art, human history and natural sciences. It also boasts a wide range of exhibitions and events, brought together in one impressive museum and art gallery in Carlisle city centre.\n\nThe museum and gallery offer something for all ages, from children's exhibitions through to classical and modern art exhibitions.\n\nWalk Hadrian's Wall\n\nHadrian's wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stretching 73 miles from the northeast coast over to the Solway Coast in Cumbria.\n\nThe site is made up of forts, milecastles and turrets, which can be explored individually or as part of the famous coast-to-coast walking route.\n\nOne mile north of the archaeologically significant Vindolanda Fort is where you will find the famous Sycamore Gap - the sycamore tree was made famous in 1991 when it featured in the blockbuster film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner.\n\nCommuting\n\nCarlisle is perfectly located, with the beauty and activities of the Lake District on the doorstep, and some of the North of England's biggest cities accessible too.\n\nCarlisle train station: Manchester (1 hour 50), London (3 hours 30), Edinburgh (1 hour 20), Glasgow (1 hour 15).\n\nCar: Newcastle (A69) 1 hour 20, Manchester (M6 South) 2 hours, Glasgow (M6 North) 1 hour 30, Edinburgh (A74(M) and A702) 2 hours 15.\n\nSchools and University\n\nCarlisle has an abundance of excellent educational settings from primary schools right through to Cumbria University.\n\nCarlisle and the surrounding villages are all well served by primary schools, so whether you are looking for your children to have a more rural school setting or a larger sized school there are plenty of options.\n\nThere are a number of excellent secondary schools in Carlisle, including Trinity and Richard Rose Academy, outside of Carlisle are Nelson Tomlinson in Wigton which is rated outstanding by Oftsed, William Howard at Brampton and Caldew at Dalston.\n\nThere are also two excellent private schools, Austin Friars in Carlisle, which takes day pupils from the age of 4 up to 18 and Lime House School at Dalston which takes day and boarding pupils from 7 to 18.\n\nCarlisle has an excellent college, offering a range of full and part-time courses across 6th Form, Apprenticeships, Higher Education and Adult Learning.\n\nCumbria University has three campuses across Carlisle and offers a range of degrees across health, sports, social work, teaching, business, law, science, conservation, outdoor studies, arts, creativity, tourism, policing and more."
