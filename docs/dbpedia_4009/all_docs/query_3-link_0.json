        "text": "AN OUTLINE HISTORY\n\nIt was Athelwold, an Englishman, who became the first prior. When the church was raised to the status of cathedral, Athelwold became the first Bishop of Carlisle (1133–55).\n\nIn 1233, the cathedral priory community were joined by two friaries – a Dominican friary and a Franciscan friary were founded close to the cathedral. The building was refurbished in the 13th and 14th centuries, receiving impetus from the presence of the court of Edward I who held his parliament in Carlisle and lived and worshipped at the cathedral, shortly before his death at Burgh-by-Sands. In the 13th century, the choir of the cathedral was rebuilt in the Gothic style, wider than the original and on a different axis. However, the new work was severely damaged in a city-wide fire in 1292, (caused by a young man called Simon of Orton, who disgruntled over his inheritance) and work had to begin again. By 1322, the arcades and the easternmost bay were complete, with the elaborate tracery and glass of the east window being in place by about 1350.\n\nIn the 15th and early 16th centuries, the monastic buildings were renewed. With the Dissolution of the Monasteries from 1536, and the establishment by Henry VIII of the Church of England, the Dominican and Franciscan friaries were dissolved and Carlisle, along with the other monastic cathedrals, was run by a secular chapter. (The practice has continued to this day.) During the English Civil War, a portion of the nave of the cathedral was demolished by the Scottish Presbyterian Army in order to use the stone to reinforce Carlisle Castle. A century later Jacobite prisoners were briefly imprisoned in the nave during the 1745 rebellion. Between 1853-1870, Carlisle Cathedral was restored by Ewan Christian. In the early 19th century, the cathedral became the subject for a geometric analysis by Robert William Billings.\n\nIn 1797, the novelist Sir Walter Scott was married here and in 1949, the cathedral came to house a memorial chapel for the Border Regiment which is based at the Cathedral.\n\nARCHAEOLOGY\n\nThere have been a number of archaeological excavations at Carlisle Cathedral. The first major works begun in late 19th century when part of the Norman cathedral was uncovered under the existing floor. Further work followed in the early part of the 20th century when parts of the cloister and chapter house were found. In the latter part of the 20th century, a major dig was conducted in the north-west corner of the cathedral, the area subsequently being converted to house the current treasury.\n\nThe Cathedral Treasury houses a permanent display of items recovered from the excavations in 1988. Highlights include the 13th century ‘Carlisle Crucifix’ made from Whitby jet, and coins and artefacts from pre-cathedral times. The Treasury is open every day and entry is free. Donations are welcome."
