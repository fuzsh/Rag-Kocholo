        "text": "Disclosure: Advertising and affiliate services, including Amazon Associates, help the cost of running my blog. Clicking ads or making purchases through affiliate links may, at no additional cost to you, earn me a small commission. I appreciate your support.\n\nGrowing up in the city of Carlisle, in the North of England, I took for granted the incredibly long history of this former Roman settlement. But there are actually so many things to do in Carlisle I now realize I should have been more appreciative of where I once lived.\n\nFor one, I was never fazed by the fact we had to drive past a 900 year old castle to get anywhere in the city. Until I moved away and then people were amazed by my blasé attitude at having such a structure dead center in the city. You mean other places didn’t all have 900-year old castles? Turns out not.\n\nAnd even though I no longer live in Carlisle, I visit my family there often. And now I can’t get enough of the unique history this border city between England and Scotland actually has.\n\nWhere is Carlisle?\n\nCarlisle is about as far north as you can get in England without actually crossing over the border into Scotland. The city has flip flopped between being north or south of the border more times than enough due to one battle or another. So much so it’s hard to tell if everybody wanted the city, or no-one did.\n\nBut the English have managed to retain Carlisle as the largest (and only) city in the northwest county of Cumbria for many a century now. As a gateway city to Scotland, the beautiful Lake District National Park, and the historically significant Hadrian’s Wall, there are many things to do in Carlisle that make it a great place to visit.\n\nGetting to Carlisle\n\nWhile Carlisle does technically have its own airport, you won’t find many international flights going there. Therefore your best bet is to either take a train, or drive to get to Carlisle.\n\nOne of the great things about Carlisle is that it’s on the main train line from London to Glasgow. So it’s a direct train with no changes to get to/from either city, both of which have plenty of international flights. Newcastle, also with an international airport, is also close by. Just over an hour drive and another city worth checking out.\n\nA few unique facts about Carlisle\n\nYou know those iconic red post boxes you see in the UK? Mainland Britain’s very first pillar box was recorded as being in Carlisle in 1853. There’s a replica outside of the Old Town Hall to commemorate it.\n\nWe’ve already covered the past ambiguous “ownership” of Carlisle. Is it Scotland, is it England? Well the 1066 invasion of Britain resulted in William the Conqueror ordering a survey of England and Wales. At the time Carlisle was part of Scotland, so it does not appear in the so-called Domesday Book.\n\nBet you didn’t know there was a link between the US President and Carlisle? Not the current President, but the 28th. President Woodrow Wilson’s mother was born in Carlisle. There’s even a plaque commemorating the President’s heritage visit to Carlisle in 1918.\n\nA settlement has been where Carlisle now stands for almost 2000 years. There are hints as to its Roman heritage throughout the city. But none so obvious as the wooden column opposite the castle bearing the original name of the city – Luguvalium.\n\nThe best things to do in Carlisle\n\nIf you love history, you’ll immediately feel at home in Carlisle. There are some incredible old buildings and ancient sites. Although many of the best things to do in Carlisle center around places like this, don’t despair, there are things for even those who yawned their way through History class.\n\nOld Town Hall\n\nIn the town center is Carlisle’s Old Town Hall. Built in 1669, the building is the focal point of the original market area in the city. Even though it’s no longer used for town council purposes, the pink building with detailed clock tower is now home to the Tourist Information.\n\nThis should definitely be one of your first stops to the city for additional ideas of what to do in the area. Bonus Tip: Check out the original market cross out front of the town hall, dating back to 1682.\n\nDo a bit of shopping\n\nWhile Carlisle doesn’t have the same retail options it used to, the shops are still worth a look around. There are still some independent stores around English Street and the old Carlisle Market Hall. The Lanes shopping centre, however, is more interesting for its history than the typical high street stores you’ll find there.\n\nThe early 1980s regeneration project took over many of the smaller run down lanes, once filled with traditional local vendors. Building a brand new shopping center that followed the course of the historic streets, there are nods to the original sites throughout.\n\nCarlisle Castle\n\nWithout a doubt one of the coolest things to do in Carlisle is spend time at the 900+ year old castle. Built in 1092, this defensive fort has pride and place near the city centre and mustn’t be missed. Explore the dungeons, the gatehouse and the underground battery where attackers would get taken out by soldiers.\n\nWhile there could be some more informational signs around, the castle is an impressive place nonetheless. Don’t forget to walk the castle walls and get some stellar views of the city and the hills in the distance.\n\nLastly, don’t miss learning about the royalty who have visited or stayed in Carlisle castle. Including Mary Queen of Scots who was imprisoned there for two months.\n\nMuseum of Military Life\n\nWithin the grounds of Carlisle Castle is an exceptional military museum. While only small, it details the border regiments of the region and the battles they fought in. From wars overseas to wars at home there are many artifacts and uniforms on display.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the museum are the vintage recruitment posters for the first and second world war. Having had a number of family members who fought in both wars, they clearly worked.\n\nBitts Park\n\nAround the back of the castle is a lovely little park known as Bitts Park. While the older buildings there have maybe seen better days, the small park is full of color in the summer months with beautiful flower beds.\n\nThe centre piece is a statue of Queen Victoria with the backdrop of Carlisle castle behind her. Top Tip: Continue walking away from the castle following the river for a lovely walk along part of the Hadrian’s Wall national trail.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral\n\nAn absolutely beautiful building in the center of the city, Carlisle Cathedral is a must see. Built in 1133, it may be one of the smallest cathedrals in the UK, but it has character. There are some beautiful stained glass windows and a wonderful subterranean treasury filled with historic artifacts.\n\nWalter Scott, the famous Scottish author of Rob Roy, was married at the cathedral on a visit to the Lake District. While not many weddings happen there nowadays, you can visit for one of the regularly scheduled classical concerts.\n\nPossibly the most striking part of the cathedral is the exquisitely decorated ceiling. Blue with gold stars, it’s mesmerizing to look at – see if you can see the angel’s face hidden in the design.\n\nGuildhall Museum\n\nProbably the oldest building in Carlisle (other than the castle and cathedral) the Guildhall was built in the early 15th Century. The building is just behind the Old Town Hall and is now a museum.\n\nThe Guidhall also houses (in my opinion) one of the nicer restaurants in the city – Franco’s Italian restaurant. Top Tip: Look up to see the interesting medieval-style gargoyles on the outside of the building.\n\nRickerby Park\n\nAnother of the city’s green spaces is the large open area known as Rickerby Park. Following the river Eden, there are trails on both sides leading around beautiful green pastures and scenic walks. Keep an eye out for the roaming herds of cows and sheep who don’t seem to bother that people are around.\n\nOne side of Rickerby Park is part of the 74 mile Hadrian’s Wall Trail, but you can cross to the other side of the river at the historic 1920s Memorial Bridge. A short distance further you’ll find the war memorial monument. Take a book, take a picnic and spend some time in the park.\n\nStreet art\n\nWhen I was growing up the only “street art” in Carlisle was a spray painted tag that read something like “Paul woz ‘ere”. Thankfully, the art around the city has improved dramatically and a few unique pieces are now dotted around the city.\n\nHowever, none are more prominent (or impressive) than a recent mural along the historic West Walls area opposite the castle. It depicts the God of war, Belatucadros and a Roman Soldier who likely worshipped him, a nod to Carlisle’s Roman history.\n\nWalk along West Walls\n\nSpeaking of West Walls, this is the most intact part of the original city limits. Instead of heading down Abbey Street to the cathedral, make sure to take a wander around the back and see some of the original city wall and an older part of the city.\n\nDifferent parts of the city walls can still be seen but this is the best place to see it as it runs towards the Castle from the Citadel near the train station.\n\nTullie House Museum\n\nTullie House is as informative about Carlisle as the 17th Century mansion it’s built around is beautiful. Only steps from the cathedral the museum covers ancient Roman history to present day. It’s the best place to learn more about Carlisle. The museum is very family friendly and even has a nice café serving lunch and drinks.\n\nCheck out the viewpoint of the castle from the top floor. Then head outside and through the underpass that connects the two where you’ll find even more artifacts from Carlisle’s past. Top Tip: See the supposed cursing stone at the entrance to the passage which locals believe has caused everything from floods to disease.\n\nEat a delicious afternoon tea\n\nHigh Tea has always been a traditional English affair, but now more than ever it seems Carlisle has upped its game. The number of cafes in Carlisle has increased significantly in recent years, and it seems most are doing their own version of an afternoon tea.\n\nMy personal favorite is Cakes & Ale, a secluded spot down Long Lane off Castle Street. Their food is delicious, the presentation is stunningly beautiful, and they even have a secret garden where you can enjoy your feast.\n\nStock up on biscuits\n\nIf afternoon tea didn’t fill you up, plan to take some biscuits home with you. After all, Carlisle has its very own biscuit factory, Carr’s (now McVitie’s). The house I grew up in is right near the factory so I remember the smells of biscuits baking at the bottom of my street. Coconut biscuit day is still the smell that will transport me back to childhood in an instant.\n\nWhile you can’t tour the factory, incorrectly labelled and slightly broken biscuits are sold incredibly cheaply in their store. I always stock up when I’m home.\n\nDixon’s Chimney\n\nBiscuits weren’t the only industry in Carlisle – there was once a cotton mill here too. Dixon’s Chimney was part of that mill, and was the tallest chimney in the country at the time it was built. A portion of the chimney was removed in the 1950s for safety reasons, but it still stands an impressive 290 ft.\n\nCarlisle citadel\n\nJust when you thought Carlisle had run out of impressive old buildings. The former fortress dates back to the 16th Century when it was commissioned by the one and only Henry VIII. Since then the site has been a prison, council offices and law courts. Now, they are to be used for the University of Cumbria.\n\nThe southern gate of the original city walls, Carlisle Citadel is now the gateway to Carlisle train station. If you arrive in the city by train, you won’t be able to miss the two giant rotundas that make up the Citadel.\n\nFurther afield\n\nWhile there are a good few things to do in Carlisle, there are many reasons you’ll want to make it your base for a couple of days. Here are a couple of ideas of places you might also want to visit while in Cumbria.\n\nLake District\n\nOne of the most beautiful National Parks in the UK, even if I’m a little bit biased because of where I grew up. Filled with small picturesque villages, high peaks to climb and stunning lakes, the area has inspired many a poet, artist and writer.\n\nBeatrix Potter and William Wordsworth both had homes here so you can see the garden that inspired Potter’s Peter Rabbit and the area where Wordsworth wandered through the Daffodils.\n\nHike around some of the most scenic areas in the Lake District and make sure to spend at least one night so you can get up early and enjoy the national park with fewer people there.\n\nHadrian’s Wall\n\nKnowing that Carlisle and surrounding area were an important settlement in northern Britain during the Roman Empire, it’s no wonder they chose to protect it. And what better way than with a huge defensive wall spanning from coast to coast?!\n\nHadrian’s Wall is almost 2000 years old and even though much of it has crumbled, there are still significant parts intact. The most interesting parts of Hadrian’s Wall can be easily seen on a day trip from Carlisle.\n\nTop Tip: Pay the extra and check out some of the historic Roman fort museums along the path of the wall. Birdoswald, Housesteads and Roman Vindolanda are all worth a visit.\n\nScotland\n\nHadrian’s Wall no longer separates Scotland from England so you can easily visit on a day trip from Cumbria. Just a stone’s throw over the border, and only a 15 minute drive from Carlisle, is the small Scottish town of Gretna.\n\nGretna is famed for its quickie marriages and eloping couples. In England anyone under 21 needed parental approval to marry, but Scotland had no such rule so many rushed over the border to tie the knot.\n\nVisit the museum at the Famous Blacksmiths Shop to learn more about the history of weddings here. Or spend your money at some of the discount stores at the Gretna Gateway Outlet Village.\n\nWhere to stay in Carlisle\n\nThe city center has a few hotels to suit a variety of budgets. Conveniently located adjacent to the railway station is the Carlisle Station Hotel, a Best Western property. For a hotel with a bit of history, there’s the Crown & Mitre Hotel right in the city centre, opposite the Old Town Hall.\n\nThe Crown & Mitre was also where President Woodrow Wilson stayed on his visit to Carlisle in the early 1900s.\n\nAnother great options is any one of the many B&Bs in the city. The best locations are down Warwick Road, most of which close enough to walk into the town centre, but far enough away to be a little quieter. Cornerways Guest House is probably one of the best with an ideal location.\n\nTop things to do in Carlisle\n\nWhile you can spend a day in Carlisle and see a few of the sites, it really does deserve a bit longer. The best thing to do is spend a couple of nights here and really get to explore the city, as well as some of the nearby places.\n\nCombine it with a trip to the Lake District where you’ll also want to spend a few nights. Since so many of the day trips around Carlisle are not very transit accessible, it’s probably better for you to have your own car.\n\nWhether you visit Carlisle for the day or spend a weekend, it is one of the most history rich cities you can see in the UK and well worth taking your time to explore.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed this post leave a comment or share using the social media buttons below.
