        "text": "Carlisle Cathedral began as a Norman Priory Church in 1122 before becoming a cathedral in 1133. Despite being one of the smallest cathedrals in the country, Carlisle Cathedral boasts the largest ‘flowing decorated Gothic’ style window in England. The structure was refurbished in the 13th and 14th centuries under King Edward I who held court in Carlisle shortly before his death in nearby Burgh-by-Sands. Further renovations took place during the reign of King Henry VIII. Unfortunately, a section of nave was later demolished during the English Civil Wars to reinforce the Castle. There have been several archaeological excavations on the site to uncover the long history of the building that now stands as a prominent monument to the long history of Carlisle.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral is open daily for quiet reflection and services. Visitors can explore the main building, shop and Treasury that displays many items of archaeological interest uncovered on the grounds of the Cathedral.\n\nThings to do and see:\n\nThe Cathedral contains a variety of interesting sights including painted screens, runic inscriptions and the regimental chapel.\n\nThe underground Treasury houses several objects of historical interest to the area.\n\nCathedral Gift shop that stocks locally made gifts, Christian themed books, jewellery and more.\n\nThe Café that sits beneath the medieval cloister and fratry that sells a range of homemade meals, coffee and cakes.\n\nA range of daily services and events, find more information here.\n\nEntry is free with an optional donation, for information on opening times see here.\n\nAccessibility:\n\nThe main Cathedral building and Café are wheelchair accessible.
