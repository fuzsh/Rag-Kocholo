        "text": "A cathedral, an abbey, castle ruins and even a mysterious stone circle, all the British staples in just one day.\n\nBack in England again, after a week in Scotland (not long enough, honestly). Day 20 was a grand adventure through Cumbria with British staples like churches, ruins and even a stone circle.\n\nStop 1: Carlisle\n\nThe Great Border City is located near the border with Scotland. The city was established by the Romans to serve as fort for the nearby Hadrian’s Wall. It was an important military stronghold, due to its proximity to Scotland, until the two kingdoms were finally unified under one king, James I.\n\nMy first stop in Carlisle and the only one I’m going to show you was the city’s cathedral. (I also visited the Tullie House Museum.) Carlisle Cathedral is fairly small, only serving a small population when it was founded in 1133. It may be small for a cathedral, but it sure is amazing on the inside.\n\nCarlisle also has a castle, which is now a museum. Lots of stuff to do in the area. Just too much in fact.\n\nStop 2: Lanercost Priory\n\nLanercost Priory is located a bit outside of Carlisle. It was founded in 1169 most likely. The Scots had a habit of raiding the priory until it was dissolved by Henry VIII. Most of the church building fell apart, but part of the nave was saved and is still used today.\n\nStop 3: Long Meg and Her Daughters\n\nLong Meg and her Daughters is a giant rock circle which constitutes one of the largest prehistoric sites in Great Britain. However, Stonehenge is so busy hogging attention that even some seasoned travelers have never heard of Meg.\n\nToday’s circle has 59 stones, only 27 of which still stand but there may have been up to 70 stones; many have disappeared through the centuries. The stones were placed in an oval shape approximately 100 m (328 ft) across. The smaller stones in the circle are Long Meg’s “daughters.”\n\nFor more on Long Meg and her Daughters, check out my post.\n\nStop 4: Penrith\n\nMy last stop was Penrith. I planned to explore more of Penrith, but I didn’t have enough time (Long Meg was a last minute add on to my trip. So worth it). I did make it to the ruins of Penrith Castle, the only attraction still open.\n\nDay 20 was jammed pack full of English (and a bit of Scottish) history. Cumbria is famous for its part of Hadrian’s Wall, but there is much more to see. Carlisle has great museums and a fantastic cathedral. There are ruins scattered all around, like Lanercost Priory and even mysterious stone circles.\n\nCheck out Day 21 where I explore Liverpool, England!"
