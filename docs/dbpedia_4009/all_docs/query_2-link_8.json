        "text": "It is hard to think of a more intimidating prospect for an architect than a site whose history stretches back 900 years, with significant changes having taken place more or less every century. This, however, is what makes Carlisle Cathedral and its surrounding precinct so interesting, and in the resultant hodgepodge of buildings of different scales, styles and ages, what gives it its charm.\n\nOn sites such as these, time often moves slower than elsewhere, so it is no surprise to learn that the origins of the Fratry project go back 15 years. Time moves rather quicker for architecture practices, so much quicker in fact that Feilden Fowles, which was founded in 2009 and appointed to the project in 2014, has actually worked on the scheme for more than half the time it has been in existence.\n\nThis long gestation has been both a necessity, given the site’s sensitivity and complexity, and also an advantage. Listening to project architect Ingrid Petit describe the various stages of the project’s development, it is clear just how invested the architects have been in it and that close relationships have formed between client, engineers, project managers, contractor and fabricators.\n\nThis is important because there is nothing obvious about the design solution Feilden Fowles has arrived at. The Fratry is a Grade I-listed hall built in the 1500s as a priory refectory, and the practice’s brief was to provide reinvigorated spaces for education and engagement and a new café – all while helping to better connect the cathedral’s physical fabric to the local community.\n\nThe Fratry itself stands on the west range of the former priory cloister, which was swept away during the Reformation. Fast forward to the early 21st century and the area had become something of a void, where, in the words of the cathedral’s dean, there was ‘more tarmac than is wise for a cathedral precinct’. The challenge was to transform this space into somewhere to pause, meet and enjoy, rather than simply to pass through.\n\nSo, if the brief demanded a new building, the question was where and how to situate it in relation to what was already there. A previous scheme for a café running along the blank face of the Fratry’s north wall had failed by being simultaneously too deferential to the existing fabric, and too far from straightforward to build given the state and structure of the wall and its foundations.\n\nFeilden Fowles’ solution was to create a new pavilion structure, following the line of the old cloister to partially enclose the former courtyard, yet in its lightness and transparency remaining porous to the view beyond. It is a deceptively bold move, which both from afar and up close looks easy: from the gentle rhythm of the elegantly proportioned bays to the regularly sized and precisely cut blocks of masonry that comprise the arches.\n\nThis impression, however, emerges from a long process of iteration, which saw the architects eventually settle on a kind of hybrid of the design’s two obvious antecedents: an open Modernist rectilinear grid and Gothic arcade. Hybrid in style, the arches are also hybrid in structure, combining steel and masonry in an elegant engineering solution where high-tech innovation and traditional techniques work hand-in-hand.\n\nIf the location of the pavilion allowed a degree of freedom in developing its formal solution, it made the link to the Fratry extremely challenging from the point of view of both construction and conservation. A porch had been added to that end of the building by the Victorian Gothicist GE Street, who, in his desire to be as faithful as possible to the medieval cornice on the exterior, had awkwardly reconfigured the interior levels. This included lowering and reversing a doorway created earlier in the century by Robert Smirke.\n\nThe pavilion is a hybrid of the design’s two obvious antecedents: an open Modernist rectilinear grid and Gothic arcade\n\nAfter extensive consultation, permission was granted for the Street porch to be removed, the Smirke doorway to be returned to its original height and orientation and a new ‘link’ to be created between the pavilion and the medieval hall and its undercroft. The conventional solution here would have been a contemporary glass box, but the height differential between Fratry and the pavilion required something rather more sophisticated.\n\nFeilden Fowles’ solution was to create a space that does not try to fade away, but has its own identity allowing it to actively negotiate the conceptual and physical transition between new and the various bits of old. Internally, the change of levels is neatly handled by splitting the space between stair leading up, stair leading down and platform lift. A sort of ‘medieval-modern’ diagrid bronze ceiling rests on thin vertical piers that establish a clerestory level, flooding the space with light and creating an elevated vantage point from which to look back at the cathedral.\n\nDoing anything to a medieval wall of this scale – and with the added complexity of a Roman culvert running nearby – is fraught with difficulty, especially when structural investigations have to be conducted during construction itself. But here as elsewhere, the elegant solution obscures the difficulty of the challenge – testament to the close collaboration that marks this project.\n\nThe link between pavilion and cathedral hall creates a space that does not try to fade away, but has its own identity\n\nThe Fratry hall itself has been decluttered and allowed to exist as one single volume, with discreetly modernised heating, lighting and AV. The undercroft is similarly very well judged, with LED strip lights helping to unify the newly opened-up volume and well-proportioned benches running either side that also serve to obscure various services. The only misstep for me is the café ceiling, which somehow feels a little too flat and a touch low in relation to the arches, if not the volume of the space, which is generous.\n\nBut this does not detract from a project that stands as an exemplar of how to work confidently, and not just sensitively or respectfully, in a historic setting. Carlisle is different to many cathedrals in England, with its beauty deriving not from the singularity of its architecture, but from its many different layers and facets – something that Feilden Fowles have not just understood but have added to in a purposeful yet empathetic way.\n\nOwen Hopkins is director of the Farrell Centre at Newcastle University\n\nArchitect’s view\n\nThe project started with a careful analysis of the Fratry building fabric and the cathedral precinct’s history in order to identify a suitable location for the new building and link with the existing. As a result, the pavilion is located to the north-west of the Fratry, on the site of the former west range of the original Augustinian priory cloister, destroyed during the Reformation.\n\nThe design balances high-tech innovation (CNC-cut stone, 3D and 2D modelling) with low-tech solutions (specialist hand carving) to enhance the historic precinct and create a pleasant space to dwell. The solidity of the pavilion’s stonework and contrasting transparency of the glazed bays formed by the arches provide visitors with clear views to the cathedral and the surrounding listed buildings. The new welcome area and public café forms a dedicated space for the clergy to greet visitors, and enables the cathedral to engage with more people in new ways and transform its teaching and learning activities.\n\nEntry to the Fratry is now through a lightweight, fully-glazed bronze structure accessed via stairs or lift at the southern end of the pavilion. The slender triangular stanchions and diagrid ceiling were designed in collaboration with engineer Structure Workshop and inspired by the stone ceiling motifs in the Fratry pulpit.\n\nThe Fratry project also marks the opening of the existing hall to all for the first time – to visit the library and attend events. Both the Fratry hall and undercroft have been decluttered and opened up by removing partitions and barriers subdividing the spaces. The refurbished undercroft has been opened up to enable views down its full length so the space may be used for teaching and learning activities with local schools and communities.\n\nIngrid Petit, associate, Feilden Fowles\n\nClient’s view\n\nThe objectives of the Fratry project were to make the medieval Fratry hall and undercroft accessible, to reveal the monastic cloister, and to create spaces that would generate income. This required balancing a sensitive approach to the existing buildings with the need to create a café in a prominent position on a busy pedestrian thoroughfare through the heart of the precinct.\n\nThe solution has achieved the brief beyond measure by stripping away accretions in the Fratry hall to reveal one of the finest spaces in Cumbria, now equipped with discreet and effective heating and audiovisual facilities, making it an attractive income-generating venue. The same approach has been applied to the undercroft, creating an atmospheric space incorporating facilities needed for both educational and commercial uses.\n\nThe new pavilion that houses the café is a triumph. It forms one side of the cloister, yet its transparency invites people into the space and through the precinct. The footprint is constrained by the space available, yet we have a café, servery, kitchen and toilets which are accessible, generous and already very popular. Everything was designed to be low maintenance, energy efficient, and of a quality to match the craftsmanship of the original buildings.\n\nInevitably the ‘link’ between old and new presented significant challenges, not least reversing the Smirke door. The link had to connect two wings of the cloister and three levels; and does this in an understated way while creating new internal and external vistas, notably of the cathedral and deanery.\n\nCanon Bryan Gray, Carlisle Cathedral\n\nEngineer’s view\n\nThis was an ambitious and technically challenging project and we were acutely aware of the responsibility associated with altering a historic building of such national and local significance –no more so than where the new building abuts the old and, as luck would have it, where a Roman culvert covered in a soft deposit of ‘dark earth’, runs under and supports the north wall.\n\nHaving removed the Victorian porch, the piled ground slab and partial basement was formed and subsequently used as a base for the temporary works. These were required to support the north wall at high level while the structural interventions were carried out below.\n\nAnew opening to the undercroft, below ground level, was carefully formed to avoid disrupting the perimeter ribs of the vaults. Directly above this, the main door surround, which had been altered by Robert Smirke 200 years previously was removed and re-reversed before being reinstalled in a raised position.\n\nThe new link structure comprises a lattice of tapered roof beams supported on triangular mullions with a movement joint where it abuts the north wall. Grasshopper was used to help develop and define the 3D geometry which was also used for the FE analysis and to develop CNC cutting patterns for the plate bronze fabrication.\n\nAlong with the stairs and platform lift, the link structure and the alterations to the north wall combine to make the refectory hall and undercroft fully accessible for the first time since the Fratry’s construction in the 15th century.\n\nPeter Laidler, Founding Director, Structure Workshop\n\nWorking detail\n\nThe elevations of the pavilion are inspired and derived from the Gothic arches found across the cathedral precinct, and in particular, the western window of the Fratry. The dropped arch profile fans out to a simple rectilinear leading edge, which echoes the Perpendicular Gothic tracery found in the east window of the cathedral. The resolution of the curved and perpendicular forms creates a subtle play of light and shadow across the sandstone elevations.\n\nThe elevations comprise a series of self-supporting stone arches with a varying block depth of 450mm to 650mm. Stainless-steel lugs and dowels, located by the masons on site, were rebated into the bed joints and tied back to steel wind posts. These posts provide additional lateral stability to the piers and support the roof beams spanning the pavilion.\n\nThe setting out of the stone blocks was determined by the maximum available bed depths from the quarry. We chose a local stone called Locharbriggs for its warm colour, which complements the patina of the surrounding buildings, while displaying a texture of horizontal black veins arranged radially to follow the arch.\n\nIngrid Petit, associate, Feilden Fowles\n\nProject data"
