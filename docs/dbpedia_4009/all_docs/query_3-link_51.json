        "text": "We are delighted that Robbie Anson - former Chorister, Consort Member and Deputy Lay Clerk at Carlisle Cathedral - has secured a Choral Scholarship at King's College, Cambridge where he has been offered a place to read Music. The Choir of King's College is one of most well-renowned representatives of English choral tradition and most famous for its Christmas television and radio broadcasts. Robbie said \"I am very grateful to the music department at Carlisle Cathedral. Without their support and investment in me, I wouldn't have felt as confident to apply for King's. It is of particular note that the Consort Choir under the directorship of Ed Taylor, enables male voices to continue to develop through their teenage years. I am really looking forward to the move to Cambridge, but will miss the Cathedral family who have been such a huge part of my life for many years\" Robbie leaves for Cambridge in September, but can be found working in the Carlisle Cathedral Cafe until then. Congratulations Robbie! üåü\n\nWe wish to congratulate our curate, The Reverend Dr Belinda Stanley, who has been appointed Cathedral Pastor at Hereford Cathedral, subject to the usual checks. The Dean & Chapter are grateful to Belinda for all she has contributed to the life of the cathedral and wish her well in her new role in the Diocese of Hereford. Canon Michael Manley, the Canon Missioner who has guided Belinda‚Äôs training at the Cathedral, said ‚ÄúIt has been a privilege to work with Belinda and her pastoral heart has made a real difference to so many people's lives. We will really miss her, but we know that our loss will be Hereford's gain‚Äù. Belinda will take up her new role in the early autumn and her last service in the Cathedral will be on Sunday 8 September at 10.30am. Please pray for Belinda as she prepares to move house and to take up her new role.\n\nThe person in charge of a major Cumbrian hospice has been appointed Carlisle Cathedral‚Äôs new Lay Safeguarding Lead. Julie Clayton is the Chief Executive at Eden Valley Hospice and Jigsaw, Cumbria's Children's Hospice. Born and brought up in Carlisle, she has also worked for the BBC and the NHS with a focus on community involvement. The voluntary role of Cathedral Lay Safeguarding Lead acts as a point of contact on Safeguarding matters at the Cathedral and is independent from the Cathedral Chapter and the Church of England. The role was previously held by David Allen, who was recently elected as the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Cumbria. Julie said: ‚ÄúI am really pleased to be supporting the team at the Cathedral to ensure the approach to safeguarding is effective. It is not only an important place of worship for Cumbria but is also an important part of our city life. I‚Äôm looking forward to working with the team to ensure its spaces are safe and welcoming for all.‚Äù The Very Revd Jonathan Brewster, Dean of Carlisle, said ‚ÄúWe would like to warmly welcome Julie to Carlisle Cathedral, in a role that supports our unwavering commitment to Safeguarding. In recent years we have worked hard, not least through our annual Safeguarding Season, to lament our past failings and to listen to those who have been affected by all forms of abuse. As we look to learn from the past, we are delighted to welcome Julie to this role as we seek to ensure the Cathedral is a safe, supportive and caring community for all. We would like to extend our gratitude to David Allen, who held this role for 5 years, for his care and commitment to all Safeguarding matters.‚Äù More information about Safeguarding at Carlisle Cathedral can be found on our website.\n\nüåü Angels' View Tours are back this summer! üåü From Monday 22 July, tours are available each day (except Sundays).
