        "text": "The Fratry, at Carlisle Cathedral, was highly commended at the Civic Trust Awards 2023. The annual award ceremony now in its 64th year was established to celebrate outstanding architecture, planning and design. The winners were announced at a prestigious event in London on 31st March. Speaking about the Fratry, judges commented: “the scheme has been executed with a high level of attention to detail and with a strong singular concept”, demonstrating sustainability and accessibility, and providing a positive civic contribution.\n\nOver 11 years since its conception, work on the Grade I-listed Fratry building was completed in June 2020. The £3.4m project was funded by a £1.9m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a major fundraising campaign supported by the Friends of Carlisle Cathedral, grant-making trusts, donations by members of the public and events at the Cathedral.\n\nFWP Ltd acted as project manager and quantity surveyor to transform the medieval Fratry at Carlisle Cathedral. Kate Shuttleworth, partner at FWP, said: “The development was not without challenges and its success was built on genuine teamwork and collaboration. We brought all our project and cost management experience to the project and fostered that team ethic that proved so important in its delivery. All the consultants involved went over and above the call of duty to ensure its success. The result is a striking development that has opened up one of the most significant heritage buildings in the city to all and has made the cathedral a popular destination for visitors. Completing and successfully delivering this complex project on such a sensitive site gave everyone involved a real sense of achievement. We are very proud to have played our part.”\n\nIngrid Petit, an Associate at Feilden Fowles, said: “We are honoured that the positive social value impact generated by the Fratry at Carlisle Cathedral has been recognised in a high commendation in the 2023 Civic Trust Awards. It has been amazing to witness how the new interventions have transformed the site for wider community benefit and to see the existing building in full use.”\n\nThe Rev’d Canon Michael Manley, Canon Missioner and Interim Dean said, “We are delighted to hear the news of this commendation in due recognition of all who supported and effected such an amazing building. It has become a worthy partner in the Cathedral’s determination to reach out to all, in the 21st century and beyond”.\n\nThe aim of the Fratry Project was to bring the Fratry building back to life, making it a cultural hub in the city centre with the addition of the pavilion café, as well as education, exhibition and event spaces in the Fratry Hall and Undercroft.\n\nThe award-winning Fratry building and café are open daily."
