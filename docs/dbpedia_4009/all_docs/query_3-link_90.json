        "text": "The firm won planning consent for the 835m² scheme in late 2016 and secured the go-ahead from the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England shortly after.\n\nThe work, described as ‘the most significant physical intervention on the site for more than 150 years’, was originally scheduled to complete this spring but is not now expected to finish until the end of the year.\n\nSince approval, construction costs have risen £140,000 to £2.42 million. The scheme has £2 million of Heritage Lottery Fund backing.\n\nThe proposal will redevelop and extend the Grade I-listed fratry, built in the 1500s as the dining hall for the cathedral priory, which currently houses one of the largest cathedral collections of 17th and 18th century books in England.\n\nA new 185m² ‘lightweight’ entrance building linked to the refurbished fratry features elevations inspired by the cathedral’s East Window, the largest and most intricate of its type in England.\n\nIngrid Petit, associate at Feilden Fowles, said: ’We’re delighted to see this important commission starting on site after years in the making. The project has been an opportunity for the practice to design a new intervention and public space linked to a historically significant building at the heart of the cathedral precinct and the city.’\n\nThe practice has been working on the scheme alongside engineers Structure Workshop and landscape architects Petherick, Urquhart and Hunt since winning an invited tender in May 2014.\n\nProject data"
