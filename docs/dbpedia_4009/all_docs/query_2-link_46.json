        "text": "Carlisle is set to host a spectacular sound and light show this coming February, bringing the splendour of the Crown Jewels - 300 miles from their home at the Tower of London - to some of the most iconic buildings in the city.\n\nBrought to Carlisle, with the support of Cumberland Council’s Discover Carlisle team, ‘Crown and Coronation’, produced by Historic Royal Palaces and Luxmuralis, will explore the history of coronations in an immersive visual show and emotive soundscape which it is planning to project on some of the country’s most famous landmarks and locations - including Carlisle Cathedral and Carlisle Castle.\n\nTickets are now on sale for the spectacular light and sound event, to be held between Thursday 15 and Saturday 17 February.\n\nCouncillor Anne Quilter, Cumberland Council’s Executive Member for Vibrant and Healthy Places, said:\n\n“Following the success of Carlisle City of Lights, more areas within Cumberland will form part of a series of events called The Light District. We are delighted to welcome the Historic Royal Palaces and Luxmuralis event to Carlisle as the first event within this new programme. This is a real coup for the city as, so far, it is the northernmost venue announced to host the light and sound spectacular.\"\n\n“Tickets are now on sale. Get yours soon to avoid disappointment.”\n\nCrown and Coronation has been created by Historic Royal Palaces - the charity that cares for the Tower of London - in partnership with Luxmuralis - as part of an artistic collaboration between artist Peter Walker and composer David Harper. It will bring the spectacle, significance, and shared experience of Coronations to life, demonstrating the pivotal role of the Crown Jewels, part of the Royal Collection, within the ceremony.\n\nFollowing a nine-day run at the iconic fortress, the show will embark on a UK wide tour, taking the story of the Crown Jewels across the country to be enjoyed at some of the most famous landmarks and locations, including Carlisle in February 2024.\n\nCharles Farris, Public Historian for the History of the Monarchy at Historic Royal Palaces, said:\n\n“The Crown Jewels hold deep religious, historic, and cultural significance, and we are really excited to be bringing this magnificent collection to people around the UK following a historic Coronation year. Crown and Coronation will immerse visitors in the rich history of the British monarchy, Coronations, and the Crown Jewels.”\n\nPeter Walker, Sculptor and Artist at Luxmuralis, said:\n\n“We are delighted to be working with Historic Royal Palaces and Discover Carlisle on this spectacular light show, which will transform some of the UK’s most remarkable buildings into an articulating and evolving display of historic images, awash with light and accompanied by compositions which chart changes to music over the period.”\n\nRunning across three nights from Thursday 15 to Saturday 17 February, the immersive sound and light installation will take place inside Carlisle Cathedral, outside of The Fratry (in the Cathedral grounds), Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery and within the grounds of Carlisle Castle, projected on majestic buildings some of which have stood for nearly 1,000 years.\n\nThe show will feature stunning imagery spanning across the centuries. Visitors will journey through more than 1,000 years of history, encompassing the reigns of some of the most famous English monarchs including William the Conqueror, Elizabeth I, and Queen Victoria.\n\nVisitors will also have the chance to marvel at detailed footage of the Crown Jewels, the objects at the very heart of the coronation ceremony, projected onto Carlisle’s historic buildings.\n\nThere will be time slots between 6.30pm and 9pm each day.\n\nTickets are £8.50 per adult, £7.50 per child (aged 5 -16) and free for under 5s. Tickets are available from www.skiddle.com or direct from the Carlisle Tourist Information Centre (01228 598596).\n\nThe Light District is a new Cumberland Council programme of events.\n\nThe council’s Discover Carlisle team, supported by funding from the UK Government through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, is working in partnership with Luxmuralis and Historic Royal Palaces to showcase Crown and Coronation in Carlisle.\n\nThe event is also organised with the support of Carlisle Cathedral, Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery and English Heritage.\n\nThe Light District builds on the success of Carlisle City of Lights and Workington Hall Lights which have both been hugely popular over recent years.\n\nImage credit: © His Majesty King Charles III 2023 / Royal Collection Trust / Historic Royal Palaces"
