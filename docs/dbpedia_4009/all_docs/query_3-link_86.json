        "text": "www.carlislecathedral.org.uk\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Cathedral\n\nTen. A decade of cathedrals. If it weren’t for Yorkshire’s slight glut on cathedrals this would be 25% of the way. I’ve now done a quarter of the Dioceses, but only 23.8% of the Anglican cathedrals. Things will start to realign in a couple of weeks time. If you want to know why: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Diocese_of_Leeds\n\nCarlisle Cathedral is compact but ancient.\n\nMonastic in origin, but maybe the monks had their priorities misplaced. Carlisle has no nave, just a very elaborate chancel/quire/presbytery. next to a disproportionately small public area. I can’t even think of a name for it. The effort went into the areas which benefitted the clerics, not the people. I reckon if you added Malmesbury Abbey (which is all nave) to this you might end up with something approaching what it should have been. They are of a similar age and style and I recognised very similar detailing in the stonework. If it weren’t for the fact that Malmesbury’s stone is blonde and Carlisle’s is auburn we’d probably get away with it (faculty application pending with the Chancellors of Bristol and Carlisle, custody agreement to be work out)\n\nWhat this means in practice is that Carlisle has very little space to play with. When you walk in through the South Door (there don’t appear to be any others) there is a friendly greeting and you’re straight into it. Unusually where there would usually be a West Door there is a chapel instead, set out at the moment for private prayer.\n\nAgain, I’m having difficulty telling the difference between a building prepared for private prayer (which is what it is billed as) and one open for tourism. Both of these things are happening here today. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is that the general public are not being allowed into the central chancel which is designated as a sterile area for use only by the choir and during services. So I’m grateful when my host, Canon Michael Manley, generously makes an exception so that I can fully appreciate the space. Look at the stars, look how they shine for you… ( and they’re all Yellow)\n\nThere is clearly a lot of work going on with schools, although like everything that has been affected this year. Michael shares a lot about things they have done, and it’s encouraging to hear of such a healthy relationship with the education sector, and also to be reassured that it’s not rocket science. Clearly a stunning building like this offers many opportunities in terms of things to look out for and objects to talk about.\n\nMichael shares with me a three level model which he believes cathedrals and churches should be working on in terms of links with people coming in. A typical visitor will be in the building for 10 to 15 minutes. What can they do to prolong that visit?\n\n▪︎ Historic / tourist. Have come into the building because it’s interesting at some level\n\n▪︎Thematic – what has an aspect of the building or its contents got to do with my life?\n\n▪︎Action – prompt some sort of response\n\nAn example of this is an interactive touch screen display which helps to interpret an elaborate medieval reredos (decorative backing to an altar) with the user selecting a point of interest and receiving an explanation. Unfortunately COVID limitations meant that this was not available to see.\n\nAnother highlight was the Sensory Trail, a series of panels aimed at engaging your senses. This took me back to that original conversation in an Oxford study. My favourite point on this trail was the lemon scented herb whose fragrance reminded me of the trail for a while (until I next applied hand sanitiser!)\n\nWe chatted for a while and I learnt something of their mixed experiences with ‘contactless giving’ solutions, and the quirks and limitations of different machines. Visitor levels are gradually returning to normal and these payment points are definitely bringing in higher levels of donations than cash only options. Eventually Michael left me alone to wander.\n\nThe central chancel is surrounded by a corridor/side aisles on three sides and the remnants of the monkish buildings on the west. The age of the sections is obvious in the architecture and the chancel ceiling is highly decorated, The ruddy walls contrast with the blue and gold ceiling, the prominent angels/heralds, the elaborate sanctuary, and the limewashed vaults of the side aisles. Colour has been well used to pick out and highlight things here, as has subtle lighting.\n\nSpace is at a premium and the corridors are well used, lined with ancient decorated panels telling the story of St Cuthbert, showing the apostles, as well as a couple more side altars and the tombs of past Bishops of Carlisle, one of whom is shown with angels holding his pillow.\n\nIt would be a challenge here to hold any large scale public display event. It’s not that sort of building. Banquets – unlikely, no floor space. But that lack of space also brings a high degree of intimacy. Usually the congregation would be right there in the quire with the choir, nestling alongside, rather than separate from them as would be the case in most places. That must bring its own problems right now, but the Cathedral is planning a reasonably normal Advent and Christmas this year whilst many larger venues are not.\n\nOutside the rain is hammering down, and I’m too late for lunch from the brand new Cathedral cafe, so I try to take in the surroundings as much as I can in the wet.\n\nThis tenth cathedral is yet again different from each one I’ve seen on this tour. In time I’ll get onto several which conform to the classical cross shaped model, but the variety is much more than I was expecting."
