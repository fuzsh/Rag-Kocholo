The magnificent east window contains some fine 14th-century stained glass. There are also intricate wood carvings, medieval painted panels and the Brougham Triptych - a Flemish altarpiece dating from the 16th century.\n\nThe Cathedral has free entry, though donations are much appreciated. And there are voluntary guides available to help you get the most out of your visit to this beautiful ecclesiastical building.\n\nThe Cathedral is usually open daily from 7.30am to 6.15pm Monday to Saturday, and 7.30am to 5.00pm on Sunday.\n\nAddress:\n\nCarlisle Cathedral\n\nThe Abbey\n\nCarlisle\n\nCumbria\n\nCA3 8TZ\n\nContact email: [email protected]\n\nContact phone number: 01228 548151"
