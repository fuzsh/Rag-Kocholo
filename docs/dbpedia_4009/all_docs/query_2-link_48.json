Please support us if you can; we suggest a donation of £4 per adult visitor, but please give whatever you can: every donation is important to us as it helps us maintain our work in the community and keep the doors of this magnificent building open for this generation and those to come.\n\nIf you are a UK taxpayer, please remember that using a Gift Aid envelope will increase your donation at no extra cost.\n\nWhatever you give, we thank you for your support.\n\nFor information about guided tour bookings please click here.\n\nPlease note that for some events and exhibitions there may be an entrance fee. This will be noted on the online calendar where relevant."
