        "text": "Sara Elaine Gardner, known affectionately as Elaine, passed away on August 5, 2024, in Pinetops, NC, at the age of 78. Born on August 3, 1946, in Fountain, NC, she spent her life dedicated to her family, her work, and her faith.\n\nElaine's career spanned over 28 years with Carolina Telephone, where she was deeply valued by her colleagues. After retiring, she continued to impact her community by assisting with Abrams Caterings and working part-time at a local daycare in Pinetops. Her love for children and commitment to her roles were evident to all who knew her.\n\nA woman of deep faith, Elaine was initially a member of Trinity Baptist Church in Tarboro with her husband, Harry Gardner. The couple later attended Penders Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, where Elaine was active in the choir and children's programs. For the last 42 years, she was a devoted member of Pinetops Baptist Church. There, she sang in the choir, participated in mission trips, and was always eager to lend a helping hand in church activities.\n\nElaine's hobbies included writing, which she pursued from a young age, contributing to her high school newspaper and composing special poems for friends and family. She enjoyed crocheting and engaging in home improvement projects with her husband. She also enjoyed interior decorating.\n\nElaine leaves behind her beloved husband of nearly 60 years, Harry Gardner, her daughter Denise Lancaster (Gary) of Elm City, NC, and her grandchildren Austin Lancaster (Jordan) of Rocky Mount, NC, Amber Shellman (Derek) of Summerville, SC, Aaron Lancaster (Grayson) of Wilson, NC, and great-grandsons, Brody and Sawyer. Another great-grandson, Baby Hayes is arriving soon. She is also survived by brother Jan Gardner. Elaine was preceded in death by her parents, Johnny and Sara Gardner, her brother, Mike Gardner, and her son, John Gardner.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to Pinetops Baptist Church. The funeral arrangements are being handled by Carlisle Funeral Home in Tarboro, NC. Elaine's life and legacy will be remembered by all who were fortunate enough to know her as a dedicated worker, a faithful follower of Jesus Christ, and a loving family member.\n\nVisitation will be at 1:00 - 2:00 PM on Monday, August 12, 2024 at Pinetops Baptist Church, with a Celebration of life service following at 2:00 PM.\n\nThe family will also be receiving friends at their home in Pinetops.\n\nElaine's family would like to thank Phoebe Barnes and also Nash Hospice and Palliative Care for all of the love and care they gave to her during the past several months. We'd also like to thank her Pinetops Baptist Church family for the many ways they showed their love and support over the past several years."
