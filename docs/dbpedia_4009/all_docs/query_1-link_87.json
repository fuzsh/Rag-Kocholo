        "text": "Our Library – a History\n\nThe original, medieval library was lost and probably destroyed in the Commonwealth period. No volumes from that time remain in the present library. In 1691, however, the library was re-founded with the donation of the library of Canon Henry Hutton by Canon Arthur Savage. Canon Hutton had been a Canon of the Cathedral until he was ejected under the Commonwealth, and died before the Restoration of 1660. He was a scholar of early Christian writers (Patristics) and his library consisted mainly of volumes by patristic writers published in 16th and 17th century editions. There are rare volumes amongst them, some in contemporary bindings.\n\nIn 1702 Bishop Thomas Smith died and left his library to the Cathedral. He was a scholar and book collector with wide ranging interests, which are reflected in his books. His religious subjects range from Roman Missals to the works of Calvin, and although most of his books are theological, they also include classical Greek and Roman authors, history, law, literature, mathematics, and the sciences. His numerous volumes of tracts and sermons include many rare items.\n\nAs a consequence of his book collecting, among English cathedral libraries only Canterbury and York have larger holdings of published works in English for the period 1641-1700. On the twin foundation of the libraries of Henry Hutton and Thomas Smith the Cathedral library has been built up. That a number of the Deans and Canons of Carlisle had scientific interests is reflected in the fact that the library has the first 120 volumes of the transactions of the Royal Society."
