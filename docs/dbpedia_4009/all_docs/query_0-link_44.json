        "text": "Heart of the City\n\nAfter many years working together, several City Centre Churches have pledged to share more resources for the good of the City’s residents, workers and visitors.\n\nWith the firm belief that God is for All (not just those that go to church), each congregation has committed itself to supporting the others in taking the good news of God’s love to the people around them. By pooling resources where they can and spending time planning together, they will be able to take on projects and events which no one church would be able to host by itself.\n\nSalvation Army | The Border Kirk | St Cuthbert with St Aidan | Methodists @ Tithe Barn | St Georges URC | Carlisle Cathedral\n\nChildren, Young People and Families\n\nOur all-age informal PLUS celebration takes place most Sunday mornings in term time in the Fratry Hall, 10.15am-11.00am. We gather informally in café style with refreshments and games, then move into songs and prayers until we welcome the choristers from our 10:30am Cathedral service. At this point, we watch a video Bible story and explore the story through activity sheets. Our families are then able to stay and chat, or go across to the Cathedral for the last part of the Eucharist service.\n\nAll children must be accompanied by a responsible adult.\n\nCATHEDRAL PLUS EUCHARISTS\n\nSeveral times a term, our 10:30am Cathedral Eucharist takes on a more all-age focus and involves our children and young people in the leadership of the service. There is always an all-age talk, some contemporary music and often music from our community children’s choir: Cantate.\n\nPlease see Our Services for forthcoming dates and more details.\n\nMISSION LINKS\n\nIn 2023, Carlisle Cathedral is working with a number of local partners:\n\nEvery Life Matters\n\nJames Rennie School\n\nPrism Arts\n\nLoudfence\n\nCarlisle One World Centre\n\nRepresentatives of the Ukrainian community\n\nWe are also supporting several charity or mission projects both financially and in prayer:\n\nThe Church Mission Society\n\nChristian Aid\n\nThe Children’s Society\n\nCarlisle Food Bank\n\nUkrainian Humanitarian Appeal\n\nThe Cathedral contributes 10% of the pledged giving scheme to charity. For more information about becoming a pledged giver, please follow this link.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2022, the Cathedral supported the building of a school in Kenya for deaf children, known as Project Riandu. We are delighted to confirm that the school is flourishing with almost 100 pupils, and that the support of our pledged givers over the years has meant that we were able to contribute 10% of all UK-based donations to the project."
