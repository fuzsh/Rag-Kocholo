        "text": "NACOGDOCHES, Texas (KTRE) - At Tuesday morning’s Nacogdoches County Commissioners Court meeting, a request was denied to move a polling location.\n\nSFA is a part of voting Pct. 34. With three months left until election day, students will cast their votes at the University Church gym on North Street. Not a far distance, but far enough to be considered inconvenient by County Elections Administrator Vicki Wood.\n\n“Right now they are having to walk about a quarter of a mile. If we can have it right there on campus, they can go right in there and vote too,” said Wood.\n\nWood said Pct. 34 has about 1,900 active voters, 900 of which are students aged 18 to 25. She said a majority of those over 25 vote early or by mail, and it’s this group of voters that commissioners are concerned about.\n\n“While it may be to an advantage for some, it would be to a disadvantage for others,” said Nacogdoches County Judge Greg Sowell.\n\nThe polling place would’ve been on the second floor of the student center, possibly creating a hassle for the elderly.\n\nPct. 3 Commissioner Robin Dawley thought it’d still be worth trying.\n\n“Curbside voting is available now. So those that cannot, can vote from their vehicle. The student government association was going to have people available to walk them to where they needed to be,” said Dawley.\n\nThanks to redistricting in 2021, Pct. 34 became majority SFA, and though it may be more convenient for students, Nacogdoches County Judge Greg Sowell said for now, it’s best to leave it where it is.\n\n“It’s not a vote against. It’s just a vote against the relocation of it, period,” said Sowell.\n\nWood said a new list of polling places without the proposed change will have to be approved by commissioners.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote is Oct. 7."
