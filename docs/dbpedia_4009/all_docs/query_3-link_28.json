        "text": "The Fratry at Carlisle Cathedral\n\nThe project provides a new accessible entrance to both floors of the Grade 1-listed Fratry building at Carlisle Cathedral for the first time in its history, creating a new pavilion with a public café, and refurbished multi-use events and educational spaces.\n\nThis project is the most significant physical intervention on the Cathedral site for over 150 years. A new entrance to the refurbished Hall and undercroft has been created, accessed through a newly built red sandstone entrance pavilion and link structure connecting old and new. The project gives the Fratry renewed purpose, welcoming the public for the first time, enriching the cathedral’s benefits to the wider community.\n\nBuilt in 1122 in a Norman architectural style and extended in the 13th and 14th centuries, the cathedral precinct’s solid masonry, local red St Bees sandstone has darkened over time. The new pavilion is made from Dumfries red sandstone from Locharbriggs, cut and installed by local stonemasons. It is located on the site of the former Augustinian priory cloister - destroyed during the Reformation. The pavilion and its green fringe delineate a new space, creating an atmosphere of the cloister that inspired the design.\n\nThe project balances high-tech innovation (CNC-cut stone, 3D and 2D modelling, complex geometries) with low-tech solutions (specialist hand carving) to enhance the historic precinct and create a pleasant space to dwell. The solidity of the new CNC-cut stonework and contrasting transparency of the glazed arches provide visitors clear views to the cathedral and surrounding listed buildings. A new welcome area and public café provide dedicated space for the clergy to greet visitors and school groups, allowing the cathedral to engage with more people and transform its teaching and learning activities. Education work will benefit from the newly refurbished undercroft beneath the Fratry hall, which has become an open, flexible event space.\n\nThe pavilion elevations are inspired by Gothic arches within the cathedral precinct. Designed following extensive public consultation in 2016, the dropped arch profile fans out to a simple rectilinear leading edge, its refinement reminiscent of the perpendicular tracery found in the east window of the cathedral. The curved and perpendicular forms creates a subtle play of light and shadow across the sandstone elevations."
