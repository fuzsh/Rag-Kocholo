        "text": "Architects and design consultants have been appointed to help deliver the £3.4m redevelopment of the Fratry at Carlisle Cathedral.\n\nThe Frank Whittle Partnership (FWP) will project manage the development, which will breathe new life into the building in the grounds of the cathedral with a new teaching, education and learning area.\n\nThe scheme was made possible by a Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) grant of almost £2m, and £1.5m in partner-funding raised by the cathedral from its supporters and sponsors.\n\nKate Shuttleworth, of FWP, said: “We’re delighted to be working as part of the team delivering the Fratry project at Carlisle Cathedral.\n\n“It has been called the most significant physical intervention on the site for more than 150 years and will bring the building, constructed in the 1500s, back to life as a centre of cultural and community life in the heart of the city.\n\n\"We look forward to playing our part in its redevelopment.\"\n\nShe continued: “There’s a great deal of satisfaction when an HLF-supported project aimed at regenerating and reviving a historical site is successfully delivered.\n\n\"It gives everyone involved a real sense of achievement and a feeling they are making a difference.”\n\nBuilt in the 1500s as a monastery dining hall, the Fratry currently houses one of the most important cathedral collections of 17th and 18th century books in England.\n\nWork on the redevelopment project, which will see the extension of the existing Grade I-listed building, has already received planning approval.\n\nWork is due to start early next year for completion by summer 2019.\n\nIt will involve essential conservation work to the roof and stonework of the Fratry building, and will see major improvements for the thousands of people who visit the cathedral each year.\n\nThe new extension will also provide easy physical access to both levels of the building as well as a new space for hospitality and catering.\n\nIt will allow the cathedral's 12th century and its collections to be seen and explored through visual media and digitally, using state of the art technology.\n\nA dedicated teaching and learning space will be available in the medieval stone-vaulted Fratry Undercroft for use by schools and other community groups.\n\nFWP has offices in Preston, Manchester and London."
