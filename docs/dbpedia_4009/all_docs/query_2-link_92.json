        "text": "This is the longest stretch of Hadrianâs Wall with extensive remains of the Roman fort. Banna, now known as Birdoswald Roman Fort, was a fort, towards the western end of Hadrian's Wall, in the Roman province of Britannia. Today the site is occupied by a former farm called Birdoswald.\n\nIn a picturesque setting beside the crossing of the River Eamont in Cumbria, Brougham Castle was founded in the early 13th century. This great keep largely survives, amid many later buildings - including the unusual double gatehouse and impressive 'Tower of League'.\n\nCarlisle has a well preserved 9th century castle which houses a permanent military museum. It is steeped in history. Mary Queen of Scotts was imprisoned there in 1567. It became a permanently occupied garrison from 1820 and was the headquarters of the Border Regiment until 1959.\n\nCarlisle's Cathedral, established in 1122 is well worth a visit. Within the Cathedral grounds are various other buildings of interest, including the Deanery, with its 14th Century Prior's Tower which contains a fine painted 16th Century heraldic ceiling.\n\nCarlisle Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located at Blackwell village, near Carlisle, Cumbria, England. The course has been on its present site since 1904, when it moved there from another location near Carlisle.\n\nThe Roman Fort at Chesters is located at a beautiful setting by the river Tyne. Built just after the wall was completed in AD 123, Chesters is the best preserved Roman Cavalry Fort in Britain. Chesters was very important to the Romans who built a sophisticated bridge across the River Tyne at this point.\n\nDrumlanrig Castle is situated on the Queensberry Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. The category A listed castle is the Dumfriesshire home of the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch and Queensberry. It is open to the public at set times during the year.\n\nWhile visiting Gretna don't miss the opportunity of visiting The Gretna Outlet Village. With 50 leading brand outlet stores you can always find the quality you trust for much lower prices than you are used to elsewhere.\n\nGretna Green your first port of call as you come over the border, this is the gateway to Scotland and England. It is famous for some of the most romantic History of Scotland. The Old Blacksmith's Shop and Centre is the main hub not just for superb Scottish shopping but also as a heritage site for runaway weddings since 1754. The Gretna Story exhibit within the Blacksmith's complex is well worth your time to explore Gretna Green Weddings history and why couples flocked here to get married.\n\nHexham Abbey is one of the earliest surviving Christian Foundations in Britain. Hexham Abbey has a rich and evocative history. It is the story of more than 1,340 years of cultural development written in stone. There has been a church on this site for more than 1,300 years, since Queen Etheldreda made a grant of lands to Wilfrid, Bishop of York c.674.\n\nHoughton Hall Garden Centre is situated in a very accessible location off Junction 44 of the M6, on the edge of the border city of Carlisle. It is spread over 3 levels, with a main level home to core gardening, gift shop, clothing, the Topiary Coffee Shop, Cafe Eden and the Eden Food Hall and Butchers.\n\nSet up on a dramatic ridge, Housesteads is the best preserved of all the Roman Forts. Housesteads Roman Fort is the remains of an auxiliary fort on Hadrian's Wall. Its ruins are at Housesteads in the civil parish of Bardon Mill in Northumberland, England, south of Broomlee Lough.\n\nThe Lake District, arguably the most beautiful area of England will need no describing. With its stunning scenery, superb walking, sailing and other out door pursuits, it is one of the top holiday areas in the British Isles. Ullswater and Keswick are an easy forty-five minute drive away.\n\nStanding more than 260m long, the Lamley Viaduct once carried the Haltwhistle to Alston railway line. This is one of the most impressive structures anywhere on the Tyne and is well worth a visit. It was built in 1852 for the Alston branch of the Newcastle and Carlisle railway and trains brought lead and coal down the valley to Haltwhistle station for transhipment. The thirteen mile branch line also carried passengers. The viaduct spans a steep sided wooded valley and excellent views can be had from the top.\n\nThe beautiful Church and ancient ruins of Lanercost Priory founded in 1166 by Henry II. For six months just before his death in 1307, Edward 1 âThe Hammer of the Scottsâ ruled England from this Augustinian monastery. Henry VIII disolved the monastries in 1536. The building was given to Thomas Dacre who converted some of the building into private residence (now called Dacre Hall). The remaining buildings fell into disrepair. The Priory Church restored about 1740 is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene.\n\nThis is one of Englandâs hidden gems. Overshadowed by the nearby Lake District this designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is less frequently visited and consequently more peaceful and less âtouristyâ. The North Pennines is a stunning landscape of open heather moors and peat lands, attractive dales and hay meadows, tumbling upland rivers and wonderful woods. With an interesting mining and industrial past, a day trip across the Pennines is a rewarding experience.\n\nSituated in stunning countryside next to a dramatically sweeping section of Hadrian's Wall and based at the site of Carvoran Roman Fort, the Roman Army Museum is an authentic and dramatic tribute to Romeâs extraordinary military legacy. The museum is spacious and is situated next to Walltown Crags, one of the highest standing sections of Hadrianâs Wall. Fantastic exhibitions in three exciting galleries allow you to immerse yourself in the life of the Roman army.\n\nThe award-winning Sands Centre is Cumbria's premier venue for Arts, Events, Entertainment, Conferences, Exhibitions and Meetings, Health and Fitness and Sport and Recreation. The centre caters to over 735,000 customers per year and plays host to an exciting mix of shows for all the family, some of comedy's biggest names, musicals from the West End, international orchestras, pop artists, ballet and opera.\n\nTalkin Tarn Country Park, 5 minutes from the Scotch Arms Mews bed and breakfast in Brampton, nestles in a 165 acre site, containing a glacial tarn surrounded by mature woodland and gentle meadows with the stunning Pennine Hills as a backdrop. The Tarn has traditionally been used for recreation since at least the middle of the 1800s. It was a popular destination for Victorians from Brampton and Carlisle and accessed by train from the North East.\n\nTullie House, traces the turbulent history of the city of Carlisle and the border regions through interactive displays and audio-visual aids. From the Roman invasion, the building of Hadrian's Wall, and the years of the Border Rievers, the museum examines the history, archaeology, and social history of the Carlisle area. The art gallery houses exhibitions of fine and decorative arts, including an extensive Pre-Raphaelite collection, and changing exhibits of contemporary artists from all across the country.\n\nThe Vindolanda site today contains both a modern world class museum using the latest interpretation techniques and display to tell a very old, very interesting Roman story and ancient buried forts regarded by many as one of Europe's most important and richest archaeological resources. This is why people from around the world travel to Vindolanda to experience its unique atmosphere and rare treasurers. Come rain or shine, Vindolanda, the outdoor site and indoor Museum will entertain you, your family or group.\n\nLocated just outside the small town of Haltwhistle, Walltown Crags is one of the best places to view Hadrian's Wall. It is also one of the darkest places in the UK for looking at the stars on a clear night. Hadrian's Wall, winds and dives through dramatic countryside along the crags of the Whin Sill. The wall is well preserved here and demonstrates how the soldiers who built it incorporated natural rock features into the Wall. At one end is Walltown turret, which was first built as a free standing tower."
