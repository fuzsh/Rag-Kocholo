        "text": "Carlisle is Cumbria’s cathedral city. It is quite small as a city, nevertheless, huge by Cumbrian standards.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral was begun in the time of William Rufus and was completed in the reign of Henry I.\n\nThe only parts remaining of the original building are the lower half of the piers supporting the tower, the principal part of the south transept, and the two eastern bays of the nave.\n\nToday, Carlisle Cathedral is a magnificent Gothic cathedral in the city centre in Carlisle, Cumbria, England.\n\nIt is the seat of the Bishop of Carlisle and the mother church of the Diocese of Carlisle. The cathedral is dedicated to the Holy Trinity and Saint Mary.\n\nVery early in the 12th century, King Henry I allowed the founding of a religious establishment at Carlisle for Augustinian Canons, later making the town the see of a Bishop.\n\nA great cathedral was accordingly constructed during that century.\n\nTo be exact, Carlisle Cathedral, was founded in 1122 as an Augustinian Priory which preceded the Cathedral.\n\nThe cloister was the hub of which today one single arch remains.\n\nThe Priory became a cathedral in 1132.\n\nFor over 900 years, there has been a service held here every day.\n\nOne of its most obvious features is its small size. Only Oxford Cathedral is smaller.\n\nThe cathedral has not always been so small.\n\nIt has seen troubled times – in particular a serious fire in 1292 which seriously damaged the fabric of the building.\n\nAdditionally, partial demolition by the Parliamentarians during the Civil War – combined with soft stone, leaving the present truncated structure.\n\nIt has a magnificent high ceiling with a beautiful blue background and gold-plated stars.\n\nIn addition to the barrel-vaulted roof, other notable features are the 15th-century carved choir stalls and dramatic 14th-century East Window.\n\nThere’s also a Brougham Trypitch altarpiece from the 16th century, which was in Amsterdam.\n\nTo mark the 900 years since the foundation of Carlisle Cathedral, a year-long programme of events has been scheduled for 2022.\n\nVisitors are invited to take some time out of their busy lives and visit the cathedral and Rest Under the Stars installation. People can relax in deckchairs and admire the stars on the cathedral’s world-famous painted ceiling."
