        "text": "Leretha Tucker (affectionately known as Aunt Rise or simply Rise in the Carlisle Community) was born on July 2, 1942 in Carlisle (Union County), South Carolina to Aurenius Tucker and Sofronia Chick Tucker. She was the 13th of 14 children and was raised in a very close-knit family and community.\n\nLeretha graduated in 1961 from Sims High School located in Union, South Carolina. During her formative years she attended the St. Luke AME Zion Church and remained a member throughout her life. Shortly after graduating from Sims High School, Leretha moved to Columbus, Ohio to further her education and to seek better opportunities that were not available in South Carolina at that time. Leretha attended college for two (2) years and held lucrative positions while in Columbus. However, life brings changes; Leretha and her husband, Charles, ended up residing a number of years initially in Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Missouri then Detroit, Michigan where they remained until finally relocating to Columbia, South Carolina where Leretha and Charles happily spent her (their) golden years.\n\nWhile Leretha remained a member of St. Luke AME Zion Church, upon her return to South Carolina, she faithfully attended the Trinity AME Zion Church in Maybinton (Newberry County), South Carolina where she became an Associate Member and served on the Usher Board for many years until her health declined. Leretha had strong work ethics.\n\nWhen she returned to South Carolina, she could have easily rested on her laurels and enjoyed retirement but she chose to find part-time employment with Walmart where she worked for over twenty (20) years during which she held numerous positions and ended her tenure as a “Greeter.” Leretha enjoyed her job tremendously and looked forward to going to work every day, even when there were days where she “probably” should have stayed home to rest....! but that's not who Leretha was...she did not have a lazy bone in her body; she felt the need to keep busy and be productive. Leretha was a soft spoken, lovely individual who had a gentle and sweet spirit. She never had a mean word to say about anyone. Leretha also enjoyed planting and growing beautiful flowers in pots, her flower garden and yard; and continued to do so for as long as she was physically able.\n\nLeretha was preceded in death by her parents, Aurenius and Sofronia Tucker; son, Clyde Williams; daughter, Leandra Williams; stepson, Charles Kenneth Tucker; and eleven (11) sisters and brothers.\n\nLeretha leaves to cherish fond memories: her husband of more than forty-two (42) years, Charles E. Tucker; two (2) sons, Keith Williams and Lionel Williams; two (2) sisters, Rose Griffin and Lillie Mae Hines; twelve (12) grandchildren; two (2) great-grandchildren; two (2) special nieces, Tina Rice and Hazel Green; one (1) special nephew, Lee Tucker; five (5) Sisters-in-law; two (2) Brothers-in-law; numerous other nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.\n\nIn Lieu of flowers please make donations payable to: Trinity AME Zion Church or St. Luke AME Zion Church and mail to: Mr. Charles E. Tucker, 4331 Maybinton Road, Whitmire, SC 29178.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/403825953419918/"
