        "text": "In an interview that aired on ABC’s Good Morning America on Friday, Randy and Evi Quaid shared their feelings of relief and future plans after a Vermont judge dismissed fugitive-from-justice charges against them.\n\nRandy Quaid said the judge’s decision felt “like finally somebody understands our situation.”\n\nLater he told ABC News, “It’s a very big relief to have been vindicated to a great extent.”\n\nThe Quaids are still wanted in Santa Barbara on felony charges filed in 2010 after they were found living in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned, with court papers saying they damaged or destroyed parts of the guesthouse. The couple fled to Canada and were arrested in Vermont last Friday when they tried to re-enter the U.S.\n\nIndeed, the Santa Barbara DA’s office says it still has a warrant out for the Quaids and tells ABC News that if the couple leaves Vermont and tries to enter another state, “We expect they will be arrested.”\n\nBut the Quaids, who were shown playing with their dog, maintain that they’re innocent, with Randy Quaid calling the guesthouse situation “just a property dispute,” and Evi Quaid insisting they weren’t squatting in their former home.\n\n“We own our house,” Evi Quaid said, looking directly at the camera, her eyes growing wide, when asked what she wants people to know about their situation.\n\nABC News’ Ryan Smith also reported that the couple said that no charges were filed when they left the U.S. for Canada and when they heard about them, they stayed to sort those out.\n\nRandy Quaid, meanwhile, indicated, as he has before, that he hopes to make an acting comeback, telling viewers, “I’d just like to thank everyone for all of their nice thoughts, and I hope you’ll see me out there real soon on the big screen or the small screen or Netflix or wherever it may be.”\n\nIn the meantime, though, as Smith reported, Quaid says he wants to help the community by becoming a volunteer fireman.\n\nWatch the Quaids‘ full interview below."
