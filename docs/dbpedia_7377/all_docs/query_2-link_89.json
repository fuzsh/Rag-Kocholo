        "text": "Birth Name: Randall Rudy Quaid\n\nPlace of Birth: Houston, Harris, Texas, U.S.\n\nDate of Birth: October 1, 1950\n\nEthnicity: English, some Scottish, Scots-Irish/Northern Irish, Irish, and German\n\nRandy Quaid is an American actor. He is the son of Juanita “Nita” Bonniedale (Jordan) and William Rudy Quaid. His younger brother is actor Dennis Quaid, and his nephew is actor Jack Quaid. He is married to film director Evi Quaid. He has a daughter with his former wife, model Ella Marie Jolly.\n\nRandy has English, and a smaller amount of Scottish, Scots-Irish/Northern Irish, Irish, and German, ancestry. During his interview on Inside the Actors Studio, 2002, Randy’s brother Dennis stated that he has Irish and Cajun ancestry. It is not clear where this Cajun lineage may originate from. None of Randy’s grandparents or great-grandparents were born in Louisiana, the state that is home to Cajun culture.\n\nRandy’s paternal great-great-great-great-grandparents, Silas Ebenezer Moore and Mourning Dumas Folsom, were said to have been of partially and/or fully Choctaw Native American ancestry. It is not clear if this is accurate.\n\nRandy’s paternal grandfather was William Jessie/Jesse Quaid (the son of John Thomas Quaid and Martha Louisa Lola Ozment). William was born in Texas, to parents from Texas. John was the son of Benjamin Walter Quaid and Martha Elizabeth Bell. Randy’s great-grandmother Martha was the daughter of Andrew Clinton Ozment and Margaret Malinda/Melinda Pierce.\n\nRandy’s paternal grandmother was named Grace Dakota Corbett. Grace was born in South Dakota, to a father from Iowa and a mother from South Dakota.\n\nRandy’s maternal grandfather was George Waymon Jordan (the son of Nathan James Hezicar Henry Clay Jordan and Martha Ellen Austin). George was born in Tennessee. Nathan was the son of Thomas Jordan and Nancy Tabitha Clark. Martha was the daughter of Thomas M./J. Austin and Sarah Pelina Beavert.\n\nRandy’s maternal grandmother was Ollie Lula French (the daughter of Gardner Zale French and Dezzie/Dessy Octavia/Octava Cagle). Ollie was born in Texas. Gardner was the son of Azale J. “Zale” French and Sarah Moore. Dezzie was the daughter of James Pinkney Cagle and Rebecca Jane Clardy.\n\nRandy is a first cousin, twice removed, of performer Gene Autry, known as The Singing Cowboy. Randy’s paternal great-great-grandparents, Andrew Clinton Ozment and Margaret Malinda Pierce, were the maternal grandparents of Gene Autry. Randy is also a cousin of actors Corbett Tuck and Hillary Tuck.\n\nSources: Information about Randy’s possible Choctaw Native American ancestry – http://objgenealogy.com\n\nGenealogies of Randy Quaid – http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com\n\nhttps://www.geni.com\n\nGenealogies of Randy Quaid (focusing on his father’s side) – http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com\n\nhttp://objgenealogy.com\n\nGenealogy of Randy’s father (focusing on his own father’s side) – http://www.findagrave.com\n\nRandy’s father on the 1930 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nRandy’s paternal great-grandfather, John Thomas Quaid, on the 1880 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nRandy’s paternal great-great-grandparents, Benjamin Walter Quaid and Martha Elizabeth Bell, on the 1900 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nBenjamin Walter Quaid and Martha Elizabeth Bell on the 1910 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nRandy’s paternal great-great-great-grandmother, Emily Ann Meese (Moore) Quaid, on the 1870 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nRandy’s paternal great-great-great-great-grandparents, Silas Ebenezer Moore and Mourning Dumas Folsom, on the 1850 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nRandy’s mother on the 1940 U.S. Census – https://familysearch.org\n\nGenealogy, and obituary, of Randy’s maternal grandmother, Ollie Lula (French) Jordan – http://www.findagrave.com"
