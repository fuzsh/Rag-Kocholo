        "text": "The actor Randy Quaid has claimed that he was raped when he was just five years old.\n\nThe Independence Day star said he felt compelled to come forward after seeing other Hollywood actors tell their own stories of sexual abuse.\n\nQuaid, now 67, claims he was just five when he was raped by a 14-year-old neightbour.\n\nThey often watched TV or played croquet together as friends but one day in the summer of 1956, he was manipulated into going to the bathroom with the older boy and threatened with a glass bottle of rubbing alcohol.\n\nHe tweeted his account in disturbingly graphic detail, and later explained why he felt the need to share the story.\n\nHe wrote: \"With all the other victims of abuse coming forward now is a good time to tell this story and join others dealing with their own, similar Hollywood encounters that must to be addressed and the perpetrators exposed for their evil smarminess.\n\n\"Time to drain the Hollywood swamp and get rid of these creeps.\"\n\nHe also explained how he thought the trauma led to him pursuing an acting career.\n\n\"Immersing myself in a character is a means of channeling the rage, removing me from myself essentially allowing me to utilize the emotional baggage that's piled up inside through the years,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"Many actors have experienced severe emotional trauma in their lives to one degree or another.\n\n\"For us, acting is more than just a career, it's a way of coping, a welcomed survival mechanism.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't speak much about what happened that day so long ago. I grew up believing the incident hadn't affected me but I realize as I grow older that it did debilitate me in ways not so evident as to make me fully aware of the consequences of the rape on a very deep, personal level.\n\n\"I suppressed my feelings and as a result I became very shy, placing too much trust in people undeserving of my trust, my instincts for self-preservation blunted; I was left feeling vulnerable, and the vulnerability in turn manifests itself in personality and behavior, which does not go unnoticed by vicious Hollywood predators where I continue to be taken advantage of by these monsters.\"\n\nQuaid is an Oscar-nominated actor, who most people will know for his role as the deadbeat dad who saves the day in Independence Day by blowing up all the aliens.\n\nThe American actor, is brother to actor Dennis Quaid, but while Hollywood might run in the family – the 67-year-old has turned his back on Hollywood with his wife Evi Motolanez, who het met on the set of Bloodhounds of Broadway.\n\nWhile Randy boasts a Golden Globe award, his resume also features nods from the big boys including the Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards and Emmys.\n\nStarring in over 90 films, Quaid has starred alongside some of Hollywood’s biggest stars including Jack Nicholson, Will Smith, Chevy Chase, Woody Harrelson, Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger."
