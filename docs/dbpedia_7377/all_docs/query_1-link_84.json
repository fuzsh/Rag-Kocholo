        "text": "LOS ANGELES Houston-born actor Randy Quaid may be the quintessential \"quick-change\" artist.\n\nMaybe he's playing a disturbed father in \"Parents.\" Or maybe he's in a detective farce such as \"Out Cold,\" with Teri Garr and John Lithgow. Maybe he's Cousin Eddie in \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,\" with Chevy Chase.\n\nOr, maybe he's banker Lester Marlow in \"Texasville,\" the long-awaited sequel to \"The Last Picture Show.\" He even may be a race team owner in \"Days of Thunder\" with Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall. Or a quirky, man-child bank robber in \"Quick Change.\"\n\nOr ... all of the above.\n\n\"I've been in 13 pictures over the past three years,\" says Quaid, the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. \"Almost as many as Donald Pleasance.\n\n\"I love working. I was doing them back-to-back-to-back. One time, I was working on three films at one time. I had to have a couple day's (beard) growth in one, clean-shaven in another one. It was a mess.\"\n\nDo any particular roles stand out?\n\n\"I have a fondness for all of them,\" says Quaid, who will turn 40 in October. \"I particularly liked \"Parents,' but it turned into a slasher movie, so it lost its charm. I grew up in that kind of '50s environment, middle-class.\n\n\"There is something about video, though. The video market is great, because it does give a life to movies that don't make it on the screen.\n\nNot because they're bad, but because the competition is so stiff.\n\n\"It is disappointing (to be in a film that doesn't have box-office success), because you always want to see it on the big screen.\"\n\nQuaid's next three films should have some \"staying power\" in the theaters this summer. He appears with Cruise in \"Days of Thunder,\" which opened Wednesday. He also stars with Bill Murray and Geena Davis in \"Quick Change,\" which opens July 13.\n\nCome Aug. 30, he will be in \"Texasville,\" which picks up where \"The Last Picture Show\" left off 20 years later.\n\n\"I've been fortunate to play a variety of roles,\" Quaid says.\n\n\"I've avoided typecasting lately.\n\n\"In \"Quick Change,' I had a fear it would put me back into that ... just being seen as the best friend, as sort of the victim he doesn't in this movie but the type of role where the character dies on page 75, the hero mourns his death and goes out to avenge his friend's death.\n\n\"It got to a point, when I'd get a script, I'd just turn to page 75 ... to see how I'd die.\n\n\"It is refreshing when you can play different types of characters.\n\nI had a broad arena to work with with Loomis (his character in \"Quick Change\"). I had the luxury of just going over the top in a lot of areas. You can get away with a lot in this character.\n\n\"I just had a lot of fun.\n\n\"I always saw Loomis as like the child of Grimm (Murray) and Phyllis (Davis). They were my parents. There's a lot of innocence and naivete to the character.\"\n\nMuray also is co-director, sharing time behind the camera with Howard Franklin.\n\n\"Bill's a good guy. Great experience,\" Quaid says. \"I had never worked before with a director who was also an actor. It was a little disconcerting going in. Billy and Howard had such a strong vision.\n\nThere was never a problem with one saying one thing to you and the other saying you something else.\n\n\"I think what they've achieved is just great. I really loved the movie, especially the second half. I think it's quite hysterical.\"\n\nQuaid is hoping that \"Texasville\" will live up to the level of excellence of its predecessor.\n\n\"I always just had a few scenes for that (the sequel),\" he says.\n\n\"It's something that Peter (director Bogdanovitch) wanted me to do. I thought it would be nice to do something 20 years later.\n\n\"It opens Aug. 30. It's not finished yet, but I've seen a rough cut.\n\n\"You have a masterpiece that precedes it. You have to look at the picture on its own merits. What I saw, it certainly has the makings of a good movie if not a great one.\"\n\nAnd, with the name Tom Cruise associated with it, \"Days of Thunder\" is sure to be a hit.\n\n\"In \"Days of Thunder,' I play the race team owner,\" Quaid says.\n\n\"I hire Cruise, and Bobby Duvall's character is a retired crew chief.\n\nTogether, the three of us have this dream of winning (the) Daytona (500).\n\n\"The movie is about that whole process. I saw that movie last night (June 21). It's very exciting. It's not just race cars going around a track. It's really well-developed with characters. Robert Towne wrote the script, and you won't find a much better writer than Robert Towne.\n\n\"I think it's one the audiences are really going to like.\n\n\"The first thing that I noticed was the noise level of the engines.\n\nThe crowds. They just astounded me, to see those stands just fill up for miles.\"\n\nQuaid doesn't always plan to be working, working, working.\n\n\"Of course, you earn a nice living,\" he says. \"It does keep you busy. It's good to keep those juices going. I wouldn't want to do that every year of my life. There are certain periods of time I just feel like working a lot, doing a lot.\n\n\"Now I'm in a period where I feel like I just want to do one or two pictures a year, sort of pace myself, work on my short game (in golf), do some other things.\n\n\"I'd like to direct. I'd like to do a picture with my brother. I'd like to do a Broadway play.\"\n\nTurn to Page 75 to see what happens ... BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 432036"
