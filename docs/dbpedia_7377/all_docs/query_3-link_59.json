        "text": "Randy Houser is back and excited to be on the Silver Screen in a true inspiration and real-life story about a young kid whose dream is to go to the Majors and play Ball\n\nGrowing up impoverished in small-town of Bowie Texas, young Rickey Hill shows an extraordinary ability to hit a baseball, despite being burdened by leg braces from a degenerative spinal disease. His stern, pastor father (DENNIS QUAID) discourages Rickey from playing baseball to protect him from injury and to have him follow in his footsteps and become a preacher. As a young man, Rickey (COLIN FORD) becomes a baseball phenomenon. His desire to participate in a try-out for a legendary major league scout divides the family and threatens Rickeyâ€™s dream of playing professional baseball. Based on a true story, THE HILL is directed by Jeff Celentano and also stars JOELLE CARTER, country music singer and songwriter RANDY HOUSER, Golden Globe nominee BONNIE BEDELIA, and SCOTT GLENN."
