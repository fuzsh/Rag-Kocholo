        "text": "Yes, he’s an interesting guy.\n\nRandy Quaid has been in a variety of movies and played a wide range of rolls. To say Randy has had a colorful career is an understatement. To say he’s led a colorful life is even more of an understatement.\n\nRandy’s colorful resume includes his portrayal of Cousin Eddie in the Vacation film franchise. He also did a memorable turn as Ishmael the Amish bowling prodigy in Kingpin and Russell Casse the fighter pilot who gave his life to defeat the invading aliens in Independence Day.\n\nHis offbeat portrayal of John Wesley Hardin in The Streets of Laredo was also noteworthy. Against that interesting backdrop, here are some things you didn’t know about Randy Quaid.\n\n1: Randy studied drama at the University of Houston. His drama teacher sent him to audition for a role in “The Last Picture Show.”\n\nRandy won a part, and it did not prove to be his last picture show."
