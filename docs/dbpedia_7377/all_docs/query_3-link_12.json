The house was previously owned by Kathleen McQuill[an], who purchased the home in 1978 from the Quaids.\n\n“I bought from Mrs. Quaid herself,” she said.\n\nNita Quaid was the realtor and owner of the house.\n\nMcQuillan lived in the house for three years, then let her mother-in-law, sister and various other friends rent and live in the former Quaid home. She said that after owning the house for the past 30 years, it was time to sell."
