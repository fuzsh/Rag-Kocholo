To make the Dean’s List, students must earn an academic grade-point average of 3.25 or higher if they are carrying 15 or more hours of coursework, or a 3.5 grade-point average if…\n\nVisionary Surgery Aids Elephant\n\nRichard McMullen has just finished the biggest case of his life – literally. On May 31, McMullen successfully completed the second of two cataract surgeries on an elephant named C’sar. C’sar is a 38-year-old African bull elephant who has been in residence at the North Carolina Zoo since 1978. In fact, he was one of…\n\nBartonella: The Epidemic You’ve Never Heard Of, Part 3\n\nThis is the final installment of a three-part series on Bartonella, bacteria that are being linked to a wide variety of ailments – many of them chronic, and some of them life-threatening. In part one, we talked about what Bartonella is, and its growing recognition as a potentially wide-ranging and serious infectious disease. Part two…\n\nBartonella: The Epidemic You’ve Never Heard Of, Part 2\n\nThis is the second installment of a three-part series on Bartonella, bacteria that are being linked to a wide variety of ailments – many of them chronic, and some of them life-threatening.

I asked if he would answer a few questions about the find’s larger implications, and he graciously agreed. …\n\nAncient Giant Turtle Fossil Revealed\n\nPicture a turtle the size of a Smart car, with a shell large enough to double as a kiddie pool. Paleontologists from North Carolina State University have found just such a specimen – the fossilized remains of a 60-million-year-old South American giant that lived in what is now Colombia. The turtle in question is Carbonemys…\n\nResearchers Use Light to Switch On Gene Expression\n\nImagine being able to control genetic expression by flipping a light switch. Researchers at North Carolina State University are using light-activated molecules to turn gene expression on and off. Their method enables greater precision when studying gene function, and could lead to targeted therapies for diseases like cancer. Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are commonly used molecules…\n\nNC State to Hold Commencement Ceremony May 12\n\nNorth Carolina State University will confer more than 5,200 degrees on graduating students during its spring commencement exercise, beginning at 9 a.m. Saturday, May 12, in the PNC Arena in Raleigh.

Cytauxzoonosis is a tick-borne, malaria-like illness that, if left untreated, has an almost 100 percent mortality rate in cats. It is caused by the parasite Cytauxzoon felis, found in ticks carried by host…\n\nNC State Hosts Science Olympiad April 28\n\nNorth Carolina State University will host more than 2,500 of the state’s best and brightest middle- and high-school students at the North Carolina Science Olympiad on Saturday, April 28. In competitive events, students will launch bottle rockets, fly rubber band-powered helicopters, race mousetrap and gravity vehicles, use catapults and investigate crime scenes. Media are invited…\n\nCompound from Wild Tomatoes is Natural, Effective Herbicide\n\nA naturally occurring compound derived from wild tomato plants is also a fast-acting, nontoxic herbicide, according to researchers at North Carolina State University. NC State entomologist Dr. Mike Roe had previously worked with the compound – known as 2-undecanone – as a natural replacement for the chemical DEET in insect repellents. Both he and his NC State…\n\nBartonella Infection Associated with Rheumatoid Illnesses in Humans\n\nA bacterium historically associated with cat scratch fever and transmitted predominately by fleas may also play a role in human rheumatoid illnesses such as arthritis, according to new research from North Carolina State University. Bartonella is a bacterium that is maintained in nature by fleas, ticks and other biting insects. It can be transmitted to…\n\nDammed if you do, dammed if you don’t\n\nThe following is a guest post by Dr. Clinton Jenkins, an NC State biologist whose research focuses on conservation science. Jenkins is co-author of a new study in PLoS ONE about the possible impact of hydroelectric dams on the Andean Amazon. Dr. Matt Finer, a researcher affiliated with Save America’s Forests and the Center for International…"
