        "text": "Some of us are born loving NC State, others start running with the Pack later in life. Regardless of when we become fans, members of Wolfpack Nation go above and beyond when it comes to our passion.\n\nThis summer, while we can’t gather with all of #WPN, we’re taking a look at how some enthusiastic fans have dedicated rooms, fan caves, and entire wings of their homes to show off their pride and loyalty for NC State. We’ll check out some of the amazing pieces in their collections as well as get to know the people behind the collections.\n\nPowder Springs, Ga. - The next installment of Wolfpack At Home takes us to the incredible fan cave of Tommy Owen. His space is named ‘The Wolves Den’, and it is a dream for Wolfpack fans. Located in the basement, his collection of all things NC State is spread across an office, a home gym, a recreation room, a kitchenette, a bathroom and a home theater, all dedicated to his love for the Pack.\n\nTommy grew up in Oxford, N.C., going to football games at Carter-Finley Stadium. His fandom with the Pack was solidified after attending Jimmy V’s basketball camp in 1982 and the 1983 men’s basketball National Championship.\n\nFrom there, he attended NC State from 1988-92 and found his true calling at WKNC, NC State’s student-run radio station. His time in college led to a 25-year radio career that has taken him across the country – including stops in Miami and Los Angeles. Currently, Tommy is the Show Director for ‘The Bert Show’ in Atlanta.\n\nTommy knew that he wanted a nice basement area to feature his lifetime collection of NC State memorabilia. His current house had exactly what he was looking for. Open the door to the basement, and you are transported to a land of NC State red, white and black.\n\nHis staircase is covered with NC State décor featuring a cutout of legendary NC State football quarterback Philip Rivers. The space opens to the rest of his basement, where the Wolfpack spirit is unavoidable.\n\nYou’ll find just about everything in Tommy’s basement features NC State, from the blades on his ceiling fan to the Block S carpet. The basement might be the ultimate location for a Wolfpack watch party, as you can spend pregame hanging out in almost any room and then sit in front of the big screen for games.\n\nTommy’s collection continues to grow as he’s received more and more NC State gear over the years. One of his original NC State pieces is a wooden, painted cutout of Tuffy. His dad got the artwork for Tommy on his 12th birthday and it’s been with him ever since. He has signed gear from coaches and players as well as plenty of NC State figurines, wall art and photos."
