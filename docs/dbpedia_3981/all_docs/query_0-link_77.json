        "text": "Turns out Philip Rivers wasn't kidding when he said in a 2020 interview that he and his wife, Tiffany, \"didn’t have a number\" on how many children they wanted to have.\n\nAt the time of that interview, the Riverses had nine kids. They are on track to make that number 10 in October.\n\nRivers, who's now the head football coach at St. Michael Catholic High in Fairhope, Ala., revealed to AL.com that he and his wife are expecting a boy. It will mark the couple's first new child since their current youngest, Anna, was born in 2019.\n\n\"We’ve had one pretty much every two years and now this is the longest gap,\" the former NFL quarterback told AL.com. \"We are all fired up. Everyone was pulling for a boy. Even our girls wanted a boy.\"\n\nMORE: Former Chargers, Colts QB Philip Rivers embraces new role as high school coach\n\nThere are seven girls and two boys in the family, so it's easy to understand why they would want the numbers to even out a bit with child No. 10.\n\nBut the family wasn't anticipating another kid joining. Tiffany is 40, and both Philip's mother and grandmother had nine children each.\n\n“We thought we would be the third generation of nine, but we decided to go double digits,\" he said, before adding: \"Or I should we didn’t decide it. God decided.\"\n\nThe Rivers' now have one more key decision facing them. What will they name the newest member of their family?\n\n\"We are still kind of figuring that out,” Rivers said. \"We have plenty of opinions. That is what we’ve got right now.\"\n\nHere's more to know about Rivers' children and how he met his wife.\n\nMORE: Why Philip Rivers retired at the end of the 2020 NFL season\n\nHow many kids does Philip Rivers have?\n\nRivers and his wife, Tiffany, have nine children but are expecting a 10th in October. Their children range in age from 4 to 21, but the age gap between the oldest and youngest will soon increase by four years.\n\nHere's the full list of the couple's nine kids, with their ages as of September 2023:\n\nHalle, 21\n\nCaroline, 18\n\nGrace, 17\n\nGunner, 15\n\nSarah, 13\n\nPeter, 11\n\nRebecca, 9\n\nClare, 7\n\nAnna, 4\n\nIYER: Patrick Mahomes not the only star of Netflix's 'Quarterback'\n\nHow Philip Rivers met his wife, Tiffany, and are raising their kids\n\nPhilips and Tiffany grew up together in Alabama. They were high school sweethearts and, according to Chargers Wire, were even middle-school sweethearts.\n\nRivers ultimately chose to go to N.C. State despite interest from Alabama and Auburn because the Wolfpack believed he could be a starting quarterback for them right away.\n\nOne year after Rivers went to N.C. State, Tiffany followed him there. They got married after Philip completed his freshman year and had their oldest child, Halle, while they were at school.\n\nAfter that, the kids kept coming.\n\n\"I think really, it was just whatever God’s will was,\" Rivers told the Indianapolis Star in September 2020. \"We were just open. Certainly didn’t have a number on it. Still don't.\"\n\nDuring his playing career, Rivers had a distinct method of interacting with his children, as noted by the Star. During the offseason, he picked the kids up from school, got them to Little League practice and spent a lot of time with them in general.\n\nDuring football season, Rivers was more focused on his career and trying to win as many games as possible for the Chargers and then the Colts.\n\n“It’s funny, because I don’t feel the stress, but mentally, physically, it can be wearing on the whole house, in general,” Rivers told the Star. “I always go, 'Football season’s here, it’s great!' and Tiffany’s like, 'It is great, you’re just in a different mode.'\"\n\nIt isn't clear whether that routine has carried over to Rivers' new career as a coach. Either way, he remains very happy with his family life and is \"excited and thankful\" to be welcoming another child.\n\n\"I think what tells the story for us is the reaction of the other children, and how excited they are,\" he told AL.com. \"They are fired up.\""
