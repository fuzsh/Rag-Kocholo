        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nNoel Mazzone\n\nTitle\n\nOffensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks\n\nOne of the nation’s most innovative, experienced, and accomplished offensive coordinators, Noel Mazzone enters his third season at Arizona in 2020. He arrived in Tucson following two years serving as offensive coordinator for Kevin Sumlin at Texas A&M. The pair first coached together in the early 1990s on the staff of the late Jim Wacker at Minnesota.\n\nPrior to Texas A&M, Mazzone directed UCLA’s offense for four seasons, and his impressive coaching resume includes time as an assistant coach in the NFL and as an offensive coordinator in the Atlantic Coast (NC State), the Big Ten (Minnesota), the SEC (Ole Miss and Auburn) and the Pac-12 (UCLA, Arizona State, Oregon State).\n\nIn addition to play-calling duties as a coordinator, Mazzone has a proven track record of developing quarterbacks for the next level. In 2017, three of Mazzone’s pupils started games in the NFL, including Philip Rivers, Brett Hundley and Brock Osweiler. He has also coached Josh Rosen, a first round pick of the Cardinals in 2018, Jason Campbell and Kelly Stouffer, among other notable signal callers.\n\nMazzone’s second and final season in College Station saw him orchestrate one of the SEC’s top passing attacks. The Aggies’ were third in the league with 252.2 passing yards per game, and their 53 total touchdowns were fifth out of 14 teams. Do-everything receiver Christian Kirk was the focal point of Mazzone’s offense, generating 1,631 all-purpose yards before becoming a second round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2016, the first year under Mazzone’s direction, the Aggies were one of a handful of FBS team to average over 200 rushing and passing yards per game, while gaining 467.1 total yards per game (No. 24 nationally, No. 2 in the SEC). The Aggies’ balanced attack featured 28 rushing touchdowns and 25 passing scores. For just the third time in school history, the 2016 squad gained more than 3,000 passing yards (3,317) and 2,000 rushing yards (2,754) in a season. A&M’s 2,754 rushing yards were the team’s second highest total in the last 20 seasons.\n\nDuring his four years at UCLA, Mazzone’s offenses left a distinctive mark on the Bruin record book. The school’s single season team records for passing, scoring and total offense were all established under Mazzone’s watch, as well as the individual single season records for passing, total offense, all-purpose yardage and rushing.\n\nMazzone has a long history of developing quarterbacks. In 2015, Mazzone oversaw freshman quarterback Rosen’s record-setting first season that saw him set numerous school passing records and earn Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors. From 2012-14, Mazzone tutored Hundley, who finished his UCLA career as the total offense and passing touchdowns leader in just three seasons and went on to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers.\n\nPrior to coaching at UCLA, Mazzone had a two-year coaching stint on Dennis Erickson’s staff at Arizona State that saw the Sun Devils rank in the top 25 nationally in total offense both seasons. Mazzone worked with Osweiler at Arizona State, who became the first Sun Devil quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season. Osweiler helped the Denver Broncos to the 2016 Super Bowl and currently plays for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nMazzone went to Arizona State from the NFL after having served as WRs coach of the New York Jets from 2006-2008 and working as a personnel consultant for the franchise in 2009.\n\nIn 2005, Mazzone enjoyed a second stint at Ole Miss as the offensive coordinator. From 2003-04, he was the OC and TEs coach at NC State. While at NC State, he coached All-American quarterback Philip Rivers, who went on to become the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. The Wolfpack offense led the ACC in six offensive categories and topped the NCAA in pass efficiency.\n\nIn 2002, he was on Erickson’s Oregon State staff as the RBs and special teams coach. While with the Beavers, he coached future NFL All-Pro RB Steven Jackson.\n\nMazzone worked as the OC and QBs coach from 1999-2001 on Tommy Tuberville’s staff at Auburn. He recruited and coached the 2000 SEC Player of the Year, Rudi Johnson, a future Pro Bowler with the Cincinnati Bengals. He also tutored All-SEC QB Ben Leard, QB Campbell, and NFL RBs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown. Auburn won the SEC West Championship under his watch (2000 and 2001 (t)).\n\nFrom 1994-98, he was on Tuberville’s staff at Mississippi as the OC/QBs coach. Ole Miss won the 1997 Motor City Bowl and produced the school’s first 1,000-yard rusher since 1950 in RB Deuce McAlister.\n\nMazzone was the QBs coach at Minnesota from 1992-94 and at TCU from 1987-91. At TCU, he coached QB Matt Vogler who set a then NCAA single-game passing record with 690 yards in a 1990 game against Houston.\n\nThe first stop on Mazzone’s coaching journey was a five-year stint at Colorado State working with the QBs and WRs. There, he mentored Stouffer, who was the sixth overall selection by the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMazzone began his coaching career, in 1980-81, as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, the University of New Mexico. He was an assistant coach at Boulder High School in Boulder, Colorado, in 1981. A native of Raton, N.M., Mazzone graduated from the New Mexico in 1980. He also played quarterback for the Lobos, leading the team in passing in 1976 and 1977."
