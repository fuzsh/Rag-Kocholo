        "text": "Flag football is a sport that continues to rise in popularity, and its reached has extended into the ranks of NFL families.\n\nDrew Brees and Philip Rivers, who were once teammates for the San Diego Chargers, spent Wednesday night watching their kids take the field in a flag football game in the San Diego area.\n\n“Amazing how it comes full circle…Philip’s son and my boys playing against each other in flag football today. It was fun reminiscing,” said Brees, in a post on Instagram.\n\nBrees and Rivers spent two seasons together on the Chargers, with Rivers serving as the backup to Brees. Brees left as a free agent and joined the Saints, and the two have enjoyed historic careers ever since.\n\nNow, it appears the friendly rivalry may be entering into a second generation."
