        "text": "Dreams Become Reality\n\nNC State coach Earle Edwards long dreamed of a day when his championship teams could play in a new stadium. That dream began to become a reality in 1962 when the Wolfpack Club and NC State commissioned a feasibility study to develop the details of a new stadium. In December 1964, Chancellor John Caldwell formed a seven-man stadium development committee headed by Raleigh businessman Walker Martin, who owned the nation’s largest General Electric dealership.\n\nThrough Walker’s diligent efforts and the support of the Wolfpack Club, nearly half of the $3.7 million needed for construction was raised through private donations. Some 3,000 fans and alumni donated at least $75 to make the stadium a reality, and each of them are recognized in the dedication program.\n\nThe other half was financed by the issuance of a 40-year public bond.\n\nThe site selected for the stadium was a 75-acre tract of land owned by the university adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds – reuniting two partners of years gone by.\n\nA lake that had been as a research fish hatchery was drained to help create the bowl of the stadium, while fields of alfalfa hay and corn were plowed under, cleared and leveled to create the expansive parking lots.\n\nThe design engineer for the stadium was State College graduate and former civil engineering instructor L.E. Wooten, who owned one of Raleigh’s biggest engineering firm. He hired NC State design professor Charles H. Kahn as the primary designer and Milton Small and Associates as the construction contractor. The erector-set stadium went up at a fast pace, with each of the 16 of the pre-stressed concrete support beams for the upper decks poured on site and the bleacher supports being trucked in from Durham.\n\n“The site…has reverberated a throaty roar of construction,” said the dedication program.\n\nConstruction of Carter Stadium – named for brothers Harry and W.J. “Nick” Carter, a pair of NC State graduates from Wallace, N.C. who were successful textile manufacturers – took a little over 22 months, much quicker than the drawn-out process needed to complete Reynolds Coliseum, which was started in 1941, remained a hulking skeleton of steel girders for nearly seven years and only officially opened on Dec. 2, 1949.\n\nCarter Stadium was literally poured into existence after about 300,000 cubic yards of dirt were removed from the site. The unique double-tiered grandstands on the east and west sides required a total of 25,000 tons of concrete, supported by 1,350 tons of steel. Seating capacity was originally listed at just over 40,000.\n\nLess than 10 months before construction was completed, Raleigh philanthropist A.E. Finley and Associates gave $290,000 to finance a fieldhouse in the north end zone, with lockerroom facilities for two 55-player teams."
