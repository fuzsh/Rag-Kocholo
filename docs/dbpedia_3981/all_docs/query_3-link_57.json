        "text": "Standout high school quarterback Gunner Rivers is already receiving high praise. Despite being in the 2027 class and just being a freshman, he is already winning All-American honors at St. Michael High School.\n\nThe young QB has shown masses of potential in his first year as a starter in high school, but with an instantly recognizable last name, it surely can’t just be a coincidence.\n\nAre Gunner Rivers and Philip Rivers Related?\n\nYes, Gunner Rivers is the eldest son of Philip Rivers, who played 17 seasons in the NFL and played four seasons in college for the NC State Wolfpack.\n\nGunner is the fourth oldest of River’s ten children and shares his father’s name. Gunner’s full name is Philip Gunner Rivers, but goes by his middle name. They don’t just share a name – Gunner also wears the same #17 jersey his father did.\n\nOnly in ninth grade, Gunner is winning awards early in his high school career, showing he already seems to be on the same path as his father.\n\nAs a freshman in 2023, Gunner was named to the MaxPreps High School Football Freshman All-American Team. It is clear to see why. Gunner averaged 291 passing yards per game and threw 3,077 passing yards over the season.\n\nPhilip was the fourth overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and played QB in college for NC State. Over four seasons in Raleigh, the standout quarterback threw for 13,484 passing yards and 95 touchdowns. Those stats put Rivers at the top of the all-time program leaderboard for passing yards and touchdowns.\n\nGunner is looking to follow in his father’s footsteps, and he will be a part of the 2027 class and is an early leader to be highly recruited. He has exceptional guidance and experience to draw on from his dad. However, Philip is not only his father but also Gunner’s head coach.\n\nRivers took charge of the St. Michael Catholic football team in 2021, following in the steps of his father, who was also a high school coach.\n\nThe elder Rivers told AL.com that Gunner is more focused than he was at that age. “He’s a little more even-keeled, which will bode well for him,” the legendary Chargerd quarterback said.\n\nOne of the similarities of their game, Philip said, “I think we see the game a lot alike. We love it. He’s a way better passer than I was at that age. He’s had 150 7-on-7 reps. I had zero.”\n\n“Going into the ninth grade, I was playing tight end, so he’s further ahead as a passer already.”\n\nMORE: 2024 NFL Draft Scouting Reports\n\nGunner is developing well for his young age, and Philip is impressed with what he has seen from his son. “He’s getting better. He’s a freshman. We all have to remind ourselves every day that he’s in the ninth grade, but he’s doing some good things.”"
