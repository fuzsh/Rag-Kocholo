        "text": "Former North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye ranks among the top overall prospects in the 2024 NFL Draft class, and in the lead-up to this spring’s event, he received guidance from NC State legend Philip Rivers. Despite their ties to rival schools, Maye trained with Rivers during pre-draft workouts in Mobile, Ala., he said on The Adam Schefter Podcast, and picked up helpful insight from the eight-time Pro Bowler.\n\n“He’s a big dude like me, so just trying to kind of find ways to relate to him,” Maye said. “Both ACC guys. I know he went to the wrong school in the ACC, but some of that same stuff. So just trying to pick his brain. One of the great quarterbacks.”\n\nRivers — whose No. 17 is one of eight retired numbers at NC State — starred for the Wolfpack from 2000-03 before his selection as the No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. He played nearly the entirety of his professional career with the Chargers, leading the league in passing touchdowns, passing yards and completion percentage during various seasons.\n\n“He’s one of the best,” Maye said. “He’s just like my brothers. He loves to compete. He’s out there, we’re throwing six-step outs, like a 10-yard drill, throwing into the net. He retired two or three years ago, and he still won the competition. So he’s just a competitor. Not only that; he’s just one of the guys. He gets along with people so well and knows the game.\n\n“He was in a little bit of a digit system with San Diego, so just picking his brain on that. He knows a little bit of different systems in the NFL, so just trying to be a sponge, ask him questions, ask him what he likes. I think the biggest thing about Philip is he stayed healthy for so long through his career. Just such a long career. I think he played 17 games for some crazy stat, 15-straight years or something. So I’m just picking his brain on how he stayed healthy.”\n\nMaye joined a group of projected first-round quarterbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels, to opt out of the NFL Combine’s on-field drills, planning instead to only complete interviews and his physical during the event. The expectation is that Maye will instead throw at UNC’s pro day.\n\nMaye — who landed at UNC as a five-star recruit and the No. 4 quarterback prospect in the 2021 class — finished his three-year career in Chapel Hill as a highly decorated star. He redshirted behind future NFL starter Sam Howell in 2021 and operated the controls of UNC’s high-powered offense over the ensuing 26 games.\n\nMaye ranks fifth all-time in passing (8,018 yards) in school history, fourth in touchdown passes (63), fourth in total offense (9,227 yards) and tied for third in total touchdowns (79). Maye led the ACC last season and ranked top-10 nationally in passing (300.7 yards per game). He also led the ACC and ranked second nationally in total offense (338.1 yards per game)."
