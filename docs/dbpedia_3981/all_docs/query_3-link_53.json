        "text": "Whenever the Chargers are on national television, I remember that Philip Rivers is still out there doing the thing, and I feel regret about not paying more attention, because good lord he can quickly remind you how brilliant he is.\n\nThursday night, Rivers brought the Chargers back from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit on the road to beat Kansas City, 29-28. The Chargers are 11-3, enjoying a renaissance in lock-step with Rivers, who has never been better than he is right now. Look at this fourth down throw to keep the Chargers alive:\n\nThat’s not bad defense, it’s just a preposterous throw.\n\nRivers may set career-highs in completion percentage, touchdown passes, yards per attempt, and quarterback rating this season. He is 37, which at last check, and by all accounts, makes you old by pro sports standards. How is he doing this?\n\nPhil has had some bum luck during his career, what with the decision-makers around him not being all that good at decisions. But Rivers has a great receiving corps this year, and head coach Anthony Lynn clearly knows what he’s doing, as illustrated by his decision to go for two Thursday rather than play for overtime on the road.\n\nRivers’ playoff opportunities have been criminally few, but he’s for sure got at least one more, and while he’s playing like this, hey, who knows."
