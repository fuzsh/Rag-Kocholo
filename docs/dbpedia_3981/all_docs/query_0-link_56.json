        "text": "Florida State lost a close one last week against the Clemson Tigers.\n\nThis week, the Seminoles will look to restart their winning ways against the Wolfpack of N.C. State.\n\nOpponent: North Carolina State Wolfpack\n\nFirst matchup: 10/25/1952 (N.C. State with a 13-7 win)\n\nSeries record: FSU leads 26-14\n\nCurrent streak: The Wolfpack with a 1 game winning streak.\n\nLast game: N.C. State pulled off a 38-22 win at Raleigh last year.\n\nThis is a key game for FSU’s bowl chances as it needs to win 3 of the next 4 to become eligible. Can Florida State start another 3 game winning streak?\n\nNoleThruandThru’s Recruiting Reminiscences\n\nFSU and NC State haven’t gone head-to-head for very many prospects throughout the years, but FSU has taken plenty of talent from the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia who held Wolfpack offers.\n\nPerhaps the most notable recruiting connection between the two teams is a defensive back from Pahokee. In 2009, Jarvis Byrd ultimately chose the Wolfpack over the Seminoles after FSU landed better DB prospects. Byrd remarkably overcame three ACL tears to finish out his career as a grad student. In 2014, NC State also fended off the ‘Noles from stealing two in-state studs, OL Will Richardson and DE Kentavius Street, while in 2015, RB Johnny Frasier spurned FSU for NC State. Richardson and Street are in the NFL while Frasier was a bust.\n\nMatt Minnick’s memorable moment\n\nThere’s been a lot of great performances by opposing QBs in Doak Campbell Stadium over the years. Names like Danny Wuerfful, Joe Hamilton, and T.J. Yates. But has there ever been a performance better than the dazzling show put on by future all-pro Phillip Rivers in 2003? Rivers went 28-39 for 422 yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions, while facing heavy pressure and must-score drives all night.\n\nMeanwhile, the Seminoles rushed for over 270 yards behind the three-headed running back group of Greg Jones, Lorenzo Booker, and Leon Washington:\n\nDespite the performance from Rivers, FSU found a way to prevail. The end result: a 50-44 victory in double OT. Leon Washington scored the game-winning TD, but it was a true team effort.\n\nMatt Minnick, the resident Tomahawk Nation historian, is a Tallahassee native and life long Seminoles fan, attending over 225 FSU football games across the country since 1986.\n\nWe love hearing your favorite Florida State football moments and memories.
