        "text": "As overtime began in last Thursday's Georgia Tech-North Carolina\n\nState game, Steve Rivers fidgeted compulsively in section 5, row\n\nJ at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh. He spit on the concrete,\n\nhitched up his pants and scanned the field, much as he has for\n\nthe last 29 years as a high school football coach. At the same\n\ntime Philip Rivers, the Wolfpack's 18-year-old freshman\n\nquarterback, was eyeing the Yellow Jackets' defense before\n\nreaching for the snap on the second play of OT. \"Be smart,\" Steve\n\nsaid, as if speaking into his son's ear. \"There's no safety\n\nsupport. The fade is open.\"\n\nIn the huddle Philip had called a slant to sophomore receiver\n\nKoren Robinson, but he had also reminded Robinson to look for\n\n\"the sign.\" As Philip settled in behind the center, he tugged on\n\nhis face mask--the signal to Robinson to change his pattern from a\n\nslant to a fade--and audibled. Moments later Philip lofted a\n\ndelicate pass to the right corner of the end zone, and as it\n\nsailed through the air Steve cried, \"There it is...There it\n\nis...There it is!\" Robinson gathered in the pass for the\n\n23-yard touchdown that won the game 30-23.\n\nThat the Cardiac Pack trailed Georgia Tech by 13 points at\n\nhalftime and by three after three quarters hardly fazed the\n\nyounger Rivers, who had already led a pair of dramatic comebacks\n\nin sparking N.C. State to an unlikely 3-0 start. In his college\n\ndebut against Arkansas State on Sept. 2, Rivers had to play\n\nthrough leg and hip cramps that required him to take saline\n\nsolution intravenously. Still, he converted two fourth-down plays\n\nduring a rain-soaked, last-minute, game-tying drive. He then\n\nengineered touchdown marches in two overtimes to win the game\n\n38-31. A week later the Wolfpack trailed by 12 with 4:29 left at\n\nIndiana, but Rivers tossed touchdown passes of 26 and 47 yards,\n\nthe latter with 54 seconds remaining, to steal a 41-38 victory in\n\nhis first road game. \"The kid is officially potty trained,\"\n\nWolfpack coach Chuck Amato said after that game. \"We don't have\n\nto put Pampers on him anymore.\"\n\nDuring each of N.C. State's comebacks Rivers has put on a headset\n\nand delivered the same message to quarterbacks coach Norm Chow,\n\nwho spent the last 22 seasons as an assistant at BYU. \"He'll tell\n\nme, 'Coach, don't worry, we're going to win,'\" Chow says. \"I'm\n\nthinking, Aren't I supposed to be telling him that? There's\n\nreally no substitute for the poise of a coach's son.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s Steve Rivers was the quarterback at Sylacauga\n\n(Ala.) High, across town from where his father, Ken, had played\n\nquarterback at B.B. Comer High. Steve signed with Mississippi\n\nState, tore up his knee and played sparingly as a reserve safety.\n\nIn '72 he began his high school coaching career, at Decatur\n\n(Ala.) High. Philip is his father's son. Both he and Steve are\n\nunmistakably confident yet refreshingly humble. They finish each\n\nother's sentences and use \"Gaaaaw-lee!\" as an expletive. Steve's\n\nwife, Joan, swears that Steve's and Philip's voices are so\n\nsimilar that she has trouble distinguishing between them on the\n\nphone. Naturally, Philip wears the same number, 17, his father\n\nwore. As a starting college quarterback Philip is living his\n\ndaddy's dream, but this is no repeat of the Marv and Todd\n\nMarinovich saga. There was no father-imposed blueprint for Philip\n\nto follow from birth. This is simply the tale of a gridiron\n\nlifer, his oldest son and the magnetic pull of the pigskin in the\n\nDeep South. What else would Steve's boy want to be?\n\nPosters of Troy Aikman, Dan Marino and Joe Montana served as\n\nwallpaper in young Philip's bedroom. When his grandmother Lois\n\ngave him red-and-white number blocks for his fourth birthday, he\n\nlined them up as two football teams and ran plays on the carpet\n\nusing shoestrings as sidelines. Later, when he played in the\n\nbackyard of the family house, Philip spray-painted yard lines and\n\nused orange pylons for end zone markers. Philip attended Steve's\n\npractices after school, and at the dinner table, conversation\n\ncentered on topics like defending against the wishbone. Philip\n\nlived for the spectacle of a Friday night in autumn. \"He once\n\nasked me, 'Mom, when I get big, can I play quarterback in the\n\ngame and be the drum major at halftime?'\" Joan recalls. \"He\n\nalways wanted to be the leader.\"\n\nPhilip had to settle for being the starting quarterback (and\n\noccasional free safety) for three years at Athens (Ala.) High,\n\nwhere Steve was the coach. As a senior last season he threw for\n\n2,025 yards and 15 touchdowns and was voted the state's player of\n\nthe year, but because of his unorthodox throwing motion, which\n\nlooks more like he's launching a javelin than a football, many\n\nmarquee college programs shunned him. Alabama and Auburn offered\n\nhim a look at quarterback but suggested he might make a better\n\nsafety or tight end. \"Recruiting is in the eye of the beholder,\"\n\nsays assistant Joe Pate, who courted Rivers for the Wolfpack. \"I\n\nconcentrated more on the results of his throws, and I realized he\n\nwas the best quarterback that I'd ever recruited.\"\n\nOn Jan. 8, only two days after Chuck Amato had replaced the fired\n\nMike O'Cain as the North Carolina State coach, Rivers became the\n\nfirst prospect Amato visited. The Wolfpack's 1999 starting\n\nquarterback had been senior Jamie Barnette, and Rivers was\n\nenticed by the possibility of starting as a freshman. Already\n\npossessing enough credits to graduate from high school, Rivers\n\nsigned with the Wolfpack a week later, loaded his car and made\n\nthe 414-mile drive to Raleigh. The kid voted Mr. Athens High\n\nSchool gave up his spot on the basketball team and a chance to\n\ntake his high school sweetheart, Tiffany Goodwin, to the senior\n\nprom.\n\nThen, on just his ninth day in Raleigh, a freak blizzard dropped\n\n20 inches of snow on campus. \"Those first two weeks I felt really\n\nhomesick,\" Rivers says. \"I kept wondering, What am I doing here?\n\nBut by the time the snow melted, I was ready to compete for the\n\nstarting quarterback job.\"\n\nStill, Chow, who has coached the likes of Steve Young, Jim\n\nMcMahon and Ty Detmer, was concerned enough about Rivers's\n\ndelivery that he made a special trip to Seattle to visit an old\n\nfriend, Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, to show him videotape of\n\nhis new passer. Holmgren screened the tape and asked, \"Does he\n\nthrow strong and accurately? If so, leave him alone.\"\n\nThe Wolfpack's receivers were also skeptical of Rivers. \"At first\n\nwe thought, This is just another freshman with some hype, and\n\nthere's no way he's going to start,\" Robinson says. \"Then we\n\ncaught his throws and changed our minds.\"\n\nAlso, any doubts about Rivers's toughness were erased during a\n\nscrimmage in spring practice, when he threw 22 passes after\n\nbreaking the index finger on his throwing hand. Surgery on the\n\nfinger forced Rivers to sit out the spring game, but Amato had\n\nchosen his starting quarterback. \"In my wildest dreams I never\n\nthought he'd be so good this quickly,\" Amato says. \"He's 18 going\n\non 28.\"\n\nAfter passing for 300 yards in a game only once at Athens High\n\nand never throwing more than 24 times in a single outing, Rivers\n\nis averaging 42 attempts and 320 yards per game. He ranks third\n\nin the nation in total offense and his 13 touchdown passes have\n\nalready matched the ACC rookie record. \"Being so young has given\n\nme more motivation,\" says Rivers, who has been intercepted only\n\nfour times. \"I don't ever want to lose a game and hear people\n\nsay, 'He's only 18, what do you expect?'\"\n\nThe strength of the 6'5\", 221-pound Rivers is another asset.\n\nBefore he hit Robinson streaking across the middle for the\n\ngame-tying touchdown against Georgia Tech, Rivers first had to\n\nbreak free from the bear hug of 287-pound tackle Bryan Corhen.\n\n\"That play tore my guts out because we had him sacked,\" Yellow\n\nJackets defensive coordinator Ted Roof said. \"We threw a bunch of\n\nblitzes at Rivers, and you expect a freshman to get rattled, but\n\nhe stayed courageous in the pocket [even while being sacked seven\n\ntimes and intercepted twice].\"\n\nRivers has kindled an excitement for football in Raleigh rarely\n\nseen since the overachieving 1967 Wolfpack and its celebrated\n\nWhite Shoes defense, led by a linebacker named Chuck Amato,\n\nclimbed as high as No. 3 in the polls. Despite having a roster\n\nwith only seven senior lettermen, Amato is the first Wolfpack\n\ncoach to debut 4-0 since 1917, and nobody is more shocked by that\n\naccomplishment than he is. \"If you told me this summer that we'd\n\nbe either 4-0 or 0-4, I'd have bet the ranch on 0-4,\" he says.\n\nAmato credits much of Rivers's precocity to his being a coach's\n\nson, but the Rivers family influence hasn't stopped there. Last\n\nsummer Steve and Joan moved, with their two younger children,\n\nStephen, 7, and Anna, 2, to Raleigh after Steve accepted the\n\ncoaching job at Wakefield High. Philip, who lives in a dorm,\n\ntries to come home one night a week, and the Riverses eat dinner\n\nin front of the television, often dissecting a tape of N.C.\n\nState's most recent heroics. Philip occasionally even finds\n\nhimself drawn back to one of his father's practices. Steve says\n\nthat he and Joan decided to make the move because they hated the\n\nidea of not supporting their son in person and because Philip\n\nstill wants to hear his father's postgame comments firsthand.\n\nAn hour after the Georgia Tech game father and son were standing\n\ninside the N.C. State field house, gazing over the end zone where\n\nthe winning touchdown had been scored and chatting about how\n\nthree great finishes add up to one great start.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAMIAN STROHMEYER BULL'S-EYE Rivers leads the nation in scoring passes after tossing three in an overtime win over Georgia Tech.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAMIAN STROHMEYER\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: SCOTT BROWN RESILIENT The Jackets kept Rivers on his heels in the first half but couldn't stop him from hooking up with Robinson in overtime."
