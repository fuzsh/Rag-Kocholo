        "text": "Honors & Recognitions\n\nSelected by his peers for inclusion in The Best Lawyers in AmericaÂ© \"Ones to Watch\" for Real Estate Law (2021-2024)\n\nNamed a \"Rising Star\" by the Georgetown Advanced Commercial Leasing Institute (2015)\n\nI have always been fascinated with commercial real estate. I grew up in a rural town outside of Greensboro, North Carolina. When my parents would take us to big cities like New York or Atlanta, I can remember staring out of the window in awe of the skyscrapers. As a commercial real estate attorney, I find one of the most rewarding experiences to be witnessing the development of a new project in which a client was involved, whether it is the opening of a new restaurant or breaking ground on a new multi-family building.\n\nWhen I am not practicing law, you will find me attempting to re-live my glory days while playing co-ed recreational softball, debating proper etiquette on the foosball table (e.g., no spinning), cheering passionately for the Wolfpack (often resulting in disappointment) or relaxing with my beautiful wife and our dog, Norman."
