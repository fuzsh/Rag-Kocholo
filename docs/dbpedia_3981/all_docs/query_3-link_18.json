        "text": "I have a lot of memories from Philip Rivers’ time playing for NC State but the one that always jumps in there first is that Indiana game, which was the second-ever college game for Rivers—and also the second-ever game for Chuck Amato as a head coach. I wasn’t even in college at State yet. But it’s always that game. I loved that game.\n\nThis one happened a week after NC State needed Rivers to throw for like 400 yards and carry the team through multiple overtimes just to beat Arkansas State. The Indiana game was the first that was on television, though, so that ended up my first introduction to Philip Rivers. I never forgot it.\n\nKoren Robinson helped, to be fair.\n\nThat season got a little crazy, but it really began on that afternoon against Indiana, where the Hoosiers took a big lead into the fourth quarter and had Antwaan Randle-El running the show offensively. The rest is hysterical."
