        "text": "After 16 years as an NFL quarterback, Philip Rivers talked about retirement with his family for the first time. But high school coaching will have to wait after he signed up for the 2020 season with the Indianapolis Colts last week.\n\n“I desire to coach high school football when all is said and done,” Rivers said. “My dad was my high school football coach, so I want to coach my boys and I want to coach young boys down the road, so I do know what’s next when my playing time’s over, so we did talk about it a little bit. I think really where we settled in was: I still love to play. Certainly not coming off my best year, but in a year where I still know I can play at a high level. I did it in spurts. I just didn’t do it consistently enough. And I love it, and, shoot, it was one of those deals where we said, ‘Well, if there’s nothing else out there, then that’ll be our answer.’ We kind of said, ‘Whatever God wants, so if there’s nothing out there, I don’t want to just try to hang on to play. If nothing’s out there, shoot, we’ll start coaching.’”\n\nRivers was an All-State quarterback for his father, Steve Rivers, at Athens High School in 1999. At North Carolina State, he won the ACC Player of the Year Award in 2003. The fourth player picked in the 2004 NFL Draft, Rivers spent two seasons behind Drew Brees with the San Diego Chargers before embarking on a 14-year starting streak with the team.\n\nIn 2019, Rivers completed 390-of-591 passes for 4,615 yards with 23 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. He hadn’t had a season with that few TD throws since 2007. With the Chargers going 5-11, Los Angeles decided it was time to part ways with the face of the franchise, and, at the end of a four-year, $83.25 million contract, Rivers agreed.\n\n“Our time was done there,” Rivers said. “Our time was done. Our family -- it was time. We moved back here to northwest Florida, where we’ve had a home now for a handful of years. Just kind of had a lot of family time and just kind of enjoyed that and kind of just wait and see, wait and see what happens. I was still excited about playing and hoping to get another opportunity to continue my career, and certainly thankful that it’s going to be with the Colts.”\n\nWHEN JOE NAMATH PLAYED FOR THE LOS ANGELES RAMS\n\nIndianapolis signed Rivers to a one-year contract worth a guaranteed $25 million – a $12 million signing bonus and a $13 million salary.\n\nThe Colts posted a 7-9 record in 2019 to miss the playoffs for the fourth time in the past five seasons. Jacoby Brissett stepped up to play quarterback after Andrew Luck abruptly retired in the preseason.\n\n“I think you have a heck of a football team,” Rivers said during a conference call with Indianapolis reporters on Saturday. “We played them last year in the opener. It was a heck of a game. I’ve certainly respected the organization from afar for a long time -- way back, many, many years, and certainly now with Chris Ballard as the GM. I’ve had some experience with (Colts coach) Frank Reich, (offensive coordinator) Nick Sirianni and (tight-ends coach) Jason Michael. At different times, I was with those guys in San Diego, so I certainly believe in Frank as a leader and as a coach.\n\n“And, shoot, as I’ve said, the football team. I hear it’s a heck of a locker room, and I know it’s a heck of a team just from seeing them compete each year, especially these past couple with this new regime, so that just kind of sums it up. I’m just excited to be a part of it, be a part of those guys and try to help us get to the top.”\n\nRivers has received eight Pro Bowl invitations, including in 2013 when Reich was the Chargers’ quarterbacks coach. The next two seasons, he was San Diego’s offensive coordinator, and Sirianni worked as the Chargers’ quarterbacks coach.\n\nRivers said he and the two coaches had had “trust-building experiences” together.\n\n\"My experience with Philip Rivers for three years in San Diego, it was tremendous,” Reich said. “When I think about that time, the first thing I think about when I think about Philip is as great of an individual player as he is, he’s all about the team. And he makes coming to work fun for everybody in the building. I mean, this guy’s got so much juice, it just comes out of him. That’s why he fits in good with this team because we’ve got a lot of guys like that.\n\n“And then he just brings that mix of talents and gifts that you need to be an elite NFL quarterback, which he's proven over his whole career. And I got to see that first-hand for three years -- a guy who has a tremendous knack for making big plays down the field. When you look at his career over 15-plus years, year in and year out this guy knows how to make plays down the field. And then he's the kind of guy who can always get you in the right play. He prepares hard -- I mean, we've set a high standard here in preparation with our quarterbacks in the past, and he'll come right in and he'll take that to a whole new level. I mean, this guy is top-notch in every way.\"\n\nRivers needs three touchdown passes to become the sixth NFL player with 400. He ranks sixth on the league’s all-time list with 59,271 passing yards, and his career passing-efficiency rating of 95.1 is the 10th-best of all-time.\n\n“I’m really not out to prove anything this season,” Rivers said. “I want to come in there, earn by teammates’ trust and respect. I do feel like over 16 years you earn some of that league-wide based on your play and your longevity. But at the same time, you’ve got to start and build that with your new teammates, so it’s not so much prove it as it is I want to prove it to, now, our locker room and to be a guy they believe in and just again be a part of something special.”\n\nRivers said he knows he doesn’t have much longer to play. If the 2020 season isn’t his last, he’ll still be one year closer to a high school sideline.\n\n“I take it one year at a time,” Rivers said. “I think last year it all worked out just how it was supposed to in terms of extension or no extension, and (Chargers general manager) Tom Telesco and I were open with one another and decided to just play it out. Let’s just play it out and we can go one year at a time, and it worked out the way it worked out. I think that’s the best way to do it. I’m 38.\n\n“I do feel good. I feel great. If I feel like I feel right now next year, then I'll be excited to keep going, again depending on how the team feels about that and etcetera, so I don't know. I don't have a number on it. Like I said, I do want to coach my son, my oldest son. I have two boys that are 12 and 8 (years old), so he'll be a sixth-grader, so we do have a little bit of time. But that is important to me to coach him in high school, so that gives you a little idea I'm not going to get carried away. I don't think you'll see me in the Tom Brady range.\n\n“But I am excited and feel like I can still help a football team go win a championship.\"\n\nMark Inabinett is a sports reporter for Alabama Media Group.
