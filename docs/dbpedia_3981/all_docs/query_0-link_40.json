        "text": "We are always looking to add quality writers to our staff, and we're pleased to announce today three new additions at Inside Pack Sports.\n\nP.J. Williams has accepted a recruiting analyst role where he will assist Steve WIlliams in covering football recruiting as well as James Henderson in basketball recruiting.\n\n“We posted this position several weeks ago, and after interviewing multiple candidates we kept going back to P.J.,” Inside Pack Sports owner James Henderson stated. “He has an extensive writing background, but more importantly, he has a passion for recruiting, which is critical to properly staffing this role. I can’t wait to see what P.J. can add to IPS!”\n\nJustin Grice has accepted a staff position with IPS where he will assist in covering non-revenue sports as well as football and basketball team coverage.\n\n“Justin already has experience covering non-revenue sports, and the more we can cover those programs, the better,” Henderson stated. “He’s going to also play a vital role in assisting the rest of the staff with football and basketball coverage throughout the year.”\n\nFinally, Samuel Locklear will serve as an intern with IPS, assisting Henderson with day-to-day operations related to the website.\n\n“Samuel made it obvious he is eager to learn all he can about sports media,” Henderson said. “He’s going to assist me daily with content production as well as helping other staff members produce content.”\n\nAll three are currently members at IPS, which makes it even more special! Below you’ll find bios on P.J., Justin, and Samuel, who begin contributing today.\n\nP.J. Williams Bio\n\nP.J. Williams was born in Raleigh and raised in Apex. He played quarterback at Middle Creek High School for NC State legend Anthony Barbour, who would routinely assume duties as scout team running back and embarrass everyone on the field.\n\nA career English and journalism teacher, PJ was a North Carolina Teaching Fellow at Elon University. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he returned to Middle Creek and spent several years coaching quarterbacks, defensive backs, and JV defense before moving to Tuscaloosa to earn his Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing from the University of Alabama.\n\nA lifelong NC State fan, his fondest Wolfpack memory is standing in ankle-deep water in the front row of Carter-Finley to witness Philip Rivers’ first career game in the red and white. He has followed NC State recruiting for over 15 years and looks forward to his new role as part of the Inside Pack Sports team.\n\nJustin Grice Bio\n\nJustin Grice was born Lowesville, NC, about 20 miles Northwest of Charlotte, as the youngest of three boys. He moved Raleigh in 2003 to attend school at NC State where he fell in love with NC State Athletics as a member of the Student Wolfpack Club.\n\nHe graduated with a degree in Finance and Economics in 2008.\n\nGrice has been working in the mortgage industry ever since 2010 and enjoys helping people navigate through the process of buying a home. He has also been writing and covering various sports at NC State for the past year including wrestling, volleyball, women’s soccer, and women’s tennis.\n\nSamuel Locklear Bio\n\nSamuel Locklear is just starting his professional writing career and is excited to join the IPS team as an intern.\n\nSamuel started out at WTCC and plans to transfer to NC State to finish his BA English degree.\n\nHe is an avid NC State fan and sports enthusiast, being raised in North Carolina and attending NC State games regularly with his family, developing a great interest in the teams and the recruiting process of each.\n\nSamuel brings a fresh perspective to IPS and all things related to NC State football and basketball. It is his goal to learn all he can with IPS while incorporating his own ideas and fresh takes on the current and future state of NC State athletics and recruiting.\n\nSamuel intends to work his way up from intern to being a full-time contributor in the future for the IPS team."
