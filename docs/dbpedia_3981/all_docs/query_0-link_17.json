        "text": "It was raining that day. That’s how I’m remembering Sept. 2, 2000. That, and one other thing: It was the first time I’d ever seen Philip Rivers play football.\n\nYou don’t forget rain like this. Or a quarterback like that.\n\nRivers was a true freshman at North Carolina State. He was 6-5 and 230 pounds, but he looked like a kid and threw like a kid – slung from the hip, as if the football were too big to lift over his head – and he talked like a kid, too. He’d say things like “gosh” and \"golly,” and when he was really fired up he’d say something like “oh boy” or “shoot.”\n\nThis was the first start of his college career. He was this kid from Alabama, where the coaches at Auburn and Alabama had taken one look at that throwing motion of his at Athens High and invited him to come play for them &mldr; as a tight end.\n\nThe wind and rain were shaking the little press box at Carter-Finley Stadium. Flash flooding would be reported that night in nearby Nelson, N.C., but we didn’t need the National Weather Service to know this was bad. I mean, it was bad. This was 20 years ago and I was covering the Wolfpack for the Charlotte Observer, but that’s how I’m remembering it.\n\nTwo decades later, I’m wondering how Rivers remembers it. He plays for the Indianapolis Colts now, of course, their biggest acquisition of a busy offseason. I’m here in Indianapolis too, as it turns out. Small world, you know? Showing restraint, I waited a good 20 minutes after the Colts’ signing of Philip Rivers was official on March 21 to request an interview with my boy, I mean, with the franchise quarterback of your Colts.\n\nFinally got him on the phone this week, and got right to it. Said hello and then told Rivers: It was raining that day against Arkansas State, wasn’t it?\n\n“Oh boy was it,” he says. “I still think to this day it was the worst rain I’ve ever played in. It was crazy.”\n\nWhat happened on the field that night was crazier. You’ll see – I’ll tell you in a minute. But first, indulge me in a personal moment. OK, fine, another personal moment, but give me a break: I covered Philip Rivers’ entire college career, and 20 years later he’s in our town, playing for our Colts? This is fun for me, and Rivers is such a good guy, he indulged a trip down memory lane.\n\n“That was the early N.C. State days,” he’s saying from his home in the Florida panhandle. “You’re going to be there at the beginning – and the end.”\n\nHang on. The end? How do you know this is your last stop? I know you’re 38 and all, I’m telling Rivers, but who knows what happens?\n\n“Oh shoot,” he says. “I don’t see all 11 of us making another move. This is our last stop.”\n\nOK. If this is where it ends, good.\n\nNow, let’s go back to the beginning.\n\n'Shoot Coach, that's how I throw it'\n\nWhat was happening on that field, in that rain, was nonsense. Philip Rivers was 18 years old and making his college debut and he was flinging the ball all over Carter-Finley Stadium. Wish you could see this, because I’m getting chills writing this, remembering that. Knowing what I know now, what we all know now – Rivers ranks sixth on the all-time NFL passing yardage list – maybe it’s obvious what was going to happen on Sept. 2, 2000.\n\nIn real time, we didn’t know that. But we knew this: Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville wanted him badly, but he saw a tight end. We’ll come back to Tuberville later. It’s a great story. I’ll let Rivers tell that one.\n\nBut Rivers just threw the ball so funny, you know? Here’s how strange it looked:\n\nFirst warm day in Raleigh in 2000, shortly before spring practice. Rivers is on campus after graduating a semester early from Athens High. He’s on the outdoor practice fields at N.C. State, warming up with teammates. Coaches aren’t allowed to be there, but the football offices overlooked the field, and Wolfpack offensive coordinator Norm Chow is on the balcony, taking a peek at his new quarterback.\n\n“I come up later,” Rivers is telling me, “and Norm Chow says: ‘Is your shoulder OK?’”\n\n“Yeah, Coach,” Rivers tells Chow. “The shoulder’s great.”\n\n“Well,” Chow says, “it looks like you’re kind of &mldr;”\n\nChow trails off. He doesn’t know what to say next. Rivers fills the silence.\n\n“Shoot, Coach,” Rivers says. “That’s the way I throw it.”\n\nNow Rivers is talking to me, and finishing the story.\n\n“That spring, (Chow) sent clips to Mike Holmgren in Seattle,” Rivers says. “Holmgren said, ‘Shoot, if he’s accurate and gets it out on time, doesn’t have lot of batted-ball issues, don’t mess with it.’”\n\nChow didn’t mess with it. He watched Rivers that spring and summer, and that fall gave an interview to two reporters on the N.C. State football beat. I can’t remember which one of us asked Chow what we could expect from Rivers – it was me and Tim Peeler of the paper in Greensboro – but I remember his thunderbolt of an answer:\n\n“If he stays healthy,” said Norm Chow, who had been offensive coordinator at BYU for Steve Young and Ty Detmer, “(Rivers) could break every record there is.”\n\nThe Arkansas State game was a few days away.\n\n'397 yards? What was that?'\n\nYou can guess what happened against Arkansas State on Sept. 2, 2000. In the first college game of his career, in the worst rain of his life, Philip Rivers threw for 397 yards and three touchdowns. He rallied the Wolfpack from a 10-point deficit in the second half. They won in double overtime. When it was over, Rivers had thrown the ball 57 times.\n\nYou think we were surprised in that wind-battered press box at Carter-Finley Stadium? Philip Rivers was stunned.\n\n“I don’t think I had any concept of 397 yards,” he’s saying now. “My dad was my coach in high school, and my most attempts was 24. I couldn’t even grasp what that looks like. Fifty-seven attempts and 397 yards? What was that?”\n\nTo my eyes, way up in that press box, he looked like Dan Marino. He was so big, the ball came out so fast, the release was so weird, the passes so accurate. I'd tell people that, and they'd laugh at the Marino comparison &mldr;\n\nListen, don’t look at me that way. Yeah, I was right about Rivers in 2000 – he’s the closest thing we’ve seen to Marino since the Dolphins great retired in 1999 – but I’m wrong a lot. Here, watch this:\n\nA few months later, in the summer of 2001 – back when adidas, lower-case ‘a,’ ran the adidas ABCD Camp in Teaneck, N.J. – I was convinced I’d seen the next great basketball player, and I had. Only, I thought the next great one was Lenny Cooke. Ever heard of him? No? Maybe you’ve heard of another adidas ABCD camper that year:\n\nLeBron James.\n\nSo anyway.\n\nWhen you’re 18 and throwing like that, coaches want you to change. In high school, Rivers went to summer camps around Alabama and was told he’d need to change his motion if he wanted to play the position in college. But to Rivers, it had come naturally.\n\n“Here’s my whole theory of that,” he says. “Being around Dad’s team since I was little, using that big football as a 5-year-old, I can’t grab it. I have to lay it in my hand, and then I have to push it. Gosh, I get the muscle memory all those years, and by the time I’m big enough to throw another way, it’s just so ingrained that I kept it.\n\n“Over the years it’s become less and less unorthodox, but it’s still kind of a noticeable. If we had no numbers on jerseys, just a bunch of guys throwing, you could pick me out.”\n\nIn real time, some were wondering if that 397-yard debut against Arkansas State was a fluke. The Red Wolves went 1-10 that year. They were no good. So how good, really, was Philip Rivers? The next game would answer the question.\n\nThe way I remember it, N.C. State’s next game was in Bloomington.\n\nAnd he torched the Hoosiers\n\n“We go to Indiana,” he’s remembering 20 years later, “and it’s a similar deal. We got behind, came back.”\n\nOn the road, this time. Against a Big Ten opponent. One week after throwing for 397 yards and three TDs against Arkansas State, Philip Rivers wasn’t going to do it again, right?\n\nRight.\n\nHe threw for 401 yards and five TDs against IU.\n\n“They had Antwaan Randle El and (coach) Cam Cameron, who ended up being my first offensive coordinator with the Chargers,” Rivers says. “We’re down like 12 points, five minutes left, something crazy. I hit Koren Robinson on a post, but here they come down the field and have a field goal to go to overtime. But Terrence Holt blocks it, and we win.”\n\nHeck, even I don’t remember that. So I’m looking it up, and sure enough: IU led 38-26 with 4:29 left, but Rivers drove the Wolfpack 70 yards with a 26-yard TD pass to Willie Wright to get within 38-33, then drove 78 yards capped by a 47-yard TD to Koren Robinson and two-point conversion to Wright for the 41-38 lead. But here they come down the field, those Hoosiers, only to have Terrence Holt – Torry Holt’s younger brother – block Andy Payne’s 37-yard field goal.\n\nMore Doyel on Rivers: Colts replace cautious Brissett with gunslinger Rivers\n\nAnd: Doyel: Teammates, opposing players love trash-talking new Colts QB Rivers\n\nThat was two games, 798 passing yards for Rivers. Here I’m reminding him what Norm Chow had said before his freshman season:\n\nIf he stays healthy, he could break every record there is.\n\nAnd you gave it a run, I’m telling Rivers. He finished his college career with 13,484 passing yards, second all-time to Detmer’s NCAA-record 15,031.\n\n“Golly,” Rivers says, “I’m telling you, you look up now and see where the passing game is now. I’m moving down that list.”\n\nAny idea where you rank now?\n\n“I used to know early on: ‘Oh shoot there goes another one. Down another notch,’” he says. “I don’t know anymore.”\n\nHe’s 14th on the list now. Time stops for none of us.\n\nTuberville and Rivers, together again\n\nYou ready for that Tommy Tuberville story? Soon.\n\nFirst, Rivers has to get to the NFL. He’s the fourth overall pick of the New York Giants in the 2004 NFL Draft, then swaps teams with No. 1 overall pick Eli Manning of the San Diego Chargers in an iconic – and ironic – draft-day deal. See, Ole Miss was among the handful of teams willing to let Rivers play quarterback out of Athens High in 2000. But the Rebels had a redshirt freshman by the name of Eli Manning.\n\nRivers went to N.C. State.\n\nWith the Chargers, Rivers has gone 123-101 as a starter, won five playoff games and climbed the NFL record books: sixth in passing yards (59,271) and touchdowns (397).\n\nAn interesting number, 397. Rivers’ debut against Arkansas State, remember? All those yards, all that rain?\n\nLife comes full circle. Rivers and his wife, Tiffany – they met in grade school, dated in high school, married in college – have nine kids. Rivers says they could have more (\"we’re open to God’s plan,\" he says), but that would mess up the symmetry: Right now he has seven girls and two boys, which is how his mom grew up. And her dad, before that.\n\n“They were both one of nine kids,” Rivers says of his mother and maternal grandfather. “Seven girls and two boys. Crazy right?”\n\nIt is. Life is. We’re almost to the Tuberville story, but first, this: Rivers’ oldest daughter will be in college this fall, but the rest of the family is moving to Indianapolis. His older son, Philip Gunner Rivers, is a sixth-grader who sees the field like his old man and even throws a little like him, from the hip. The plan all along has been for Philip to be a high school coach. The NFL got in the way, but it won’t get in the way when Gunner reaches high school. Philip plans to coach him, most likely in his home state of Alabama.\n\nFor now, the Rivers family lives in the Florida panhandle, where one of their neighbors – I kid you not – is Tommy Tuberville. Rivers rides a bike past his house, sees him walking the beach.\n\n“Every time I see him, we laugh,” Rivers says. “He’ll say, ‘Oh boy, you’ve come a long way from Athens High School. We think you’d have been a good tight end!’\n\n“And I’ll go, ‘Shoot, Coach, I’d have been coaching 16 years ago if I played tight end.’”\n\nLife coming full circle includes this return to Indianapolis for Rivers, who was here for the 2012 Super Bowl as a finalist for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award, and for three Chargers-Colts games. He was at Lucas Oil Stadium the night before the Chargers’ 36-14 victory on Nov. 28, 2010, to watch an IHSAA state championship game. On other trips to Indy, Rivers has been to the old “Hoosiers” gym in Knightstown. He’s had the shrimp cocktail at St. Elmo’s.\n\n“Golly,” he says, “it’s hot!”\n\nSo were the emotions between Rivers and Colts fans. It’s how he plays, a ball of fire to Peyton Manning’s ice, and opposing fans don’t always love it. They didn’t love it here. Rivers remembers.\n\n“We had interactions with the fans,” is how Rivers puts it, and I can almost hear him smiling over the phone. “We’re just super excited to be coming there. I always felt it was a respectful crowd. Knowledgeable, respectful fans. I always remember coming home, telling Tiff: ‘They know football, and you see a ton of fans.' Shoot, it’s awesome.”\n\nHe’ll fit in just fine here in Indianapolis, where it will be our honor to watch this remarkable football career reach its conclusion. Now imagine being lucky enough to have seen it begin. But you'll have to imagine bad weather, because it was raining that day. That’s how I’m remembering Sept. 2, 2000."
