        "text": "ALLEN PARK -- Last week, the Detroit Lions were preparing to face a dual-threat quarterback making his NFL debut. This week, they’re facing a traditional pocket passer about to make his 210th consecutive start.\n\nWhile the preparation to face a more mobile quarterback in Kyler Murray when compared to Philip Rivers is different, Lions coaches say it’s an “equally as difficult challenge.”\n\n“It’s different, obviously, than getting ready for Murray but there’s still a lot of work and there is a lot of detail to it,” Lions defensive coordinator Paul Pasqualoni said during a conference call with reporters. \"It’s not an easy task. It’s like six of one or a half dozen of the other. When you get a guy like Rivers, you certainly want to do a great job in the rush. You certainly want to create pressure, but at the same time he is a very smart quarterback.\n\n“Certainly, you’re trying to plan to rush and to have a good rush, and the marriage of the rush and the coverage have to work together. Certainly, it always does, regardless of if it’s Murray or Rivers. Like I said, it’s still a challenge. Now obviously he’s not going to try to escape the pocket, you don’t have those issues, but he presents quite a few other issues.”\n\nRelated: Matt Patricia: Kyler Murray’s dual-threat ability poses ‘major problem’ for Lions defense\n\nThe Lions defense contained Murray to three carries for 13 yards while sacking him five times and picking him off once last week. Linebacker Devon Kennard had three sacks in the first half alone while Christian Jones and rookie Jahlani Tavai each had one.\n\nMurray picked things up in the fourth quarter and overtime against Detroit, completing 20 of 29 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns after a slow start. He finished 29 of 54 for 308 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in the 27-27 tie.\n\nPasqualoni pointed to the rookie’s ability to get the ball out quickly and receiver Larry Fitzgerald making some big plays on third down as a deterrent to his defense’s pass rush late in the game.\n\n“I think at the end of the day a guy like Philip Rivers, a guy like Tom Brady, a guy like Aaron Rodgers, they’re going to figure it out,” Pasqualoni said. \"I just think that you have to be very sound at what you’re doing. You have to have -- if you’re playing zones, you have to be right on top of what you’re doing with the zone. If you’re playing man, you have to rely on technique and fundamentals.\n\n“It’s going to be hard. To say we’re going to go in there and fool them all day, I don’t think that happens at this level with that level of quarterback.”\n\nRelated: Detroit Lions open as 3-point underdogs for home opener vs. Los Angeles Chargers\n\nRivers completed 25 of 34 passes for 333 yards with three touchdowns and one interception in Los Angeles’ 30-24 overtime win against Indianapolis last week. Rivers and running back Austin Ekeler -- filling in for Melvin Gordon -- connected on two touchdown passes. Ekeler put the game away in overtime with a 7-yard touchdown run 5 minutes into the extra frame.\n\nDuring a conference call with reporters, third-year coach Anthony Lynn was quick to point to his quarterback’s dedication to his craft. Lynn went as far as to say Rivers’ level of preparedness is on par “with any coaches on our staff, to be honest with you.”\n\n“He’s very professional. He knows when to have a good time and he knows when to flip a switch and it’s all about business. He’s a good leader in the locker room,\" Lynn said. “He’s extremely competitive. That’s probably the biggest thing I’ve been impressed with is his preparation. But he grew up in a coaching household with his father and I’m sure he’s been taught that from the time he was a teenager.”\n\nLions coach Matt Patricia echoed his defensive coordinator’s comments of Rivers’ ability to make plays happen without his legs. He reflected on the 2007 AFC championship game when he was New England’s linebackers coach and Rivers was playing on a torn ACL.\n\nRelated: Lions safety Quandre Diggs excited to face Chargers: ‘I freaking love, love Philip Rivers’\n\nRivers and the Chargers offense struggled against the Patriots, but the quarterback’s toughness is something that still impresses Patricia 12 years later.\n\n“I just thought it was a late-season game and he stood in there and we knew he wasn’t going to be able to move much,” Patricia said. \"But his competitiveness, his toughness, his ability to decipher what defenses do and just pick them apart with his brain and the pre-snap changes that he has, that he can make at the line of scrimmage -- the check-with-me packages, things like that.\n\n“He just keeps getting better and better every single year. Even through the coaching changes -- he’s had different systems, different coordinators, different head coaches and I think he just continually thrives in all of those situations. He’s got great mobility when he has to in the pocket. He can move, he can side-step, he can get out of trouble, and he still finds those receivers downfield.”\n\nRelated: Lions notes: Jarrad Davis ramps up activity at practice\n\nLions quarterback Matthew Stafford has started 129 straight games at quarterback dating back to 2011. Like Patricia, Stafford recalled the 2007 AFC championship game when looking back at Rivers’ career and 209 consecutive starts under center.\n\n“I got a lot of respect for him as a player. He’s a great quarterback, does a great job I think he’s underappreciated in a lot of aspects,” Stafford said. “Obviously, like you said, I mean the guy shows up for his team every week. Played in an AFC championship game with a torn ACL, which is incredible. I’m sure he’s played through a million other things that nobody knows about, too. Got to give him a lot of credit, guy is there week-in and week-out. He’s playing at a high level. It’s impressive.”"
