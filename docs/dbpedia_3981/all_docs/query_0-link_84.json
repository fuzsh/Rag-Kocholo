        "text": "GASTONIA â€“ While N.C. State football coach Dave Doeren's speech was about his career and his attempt to build his Wolfpack into a perennial winning program, it well could've been about each of the 2017 Gaston County Sports Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nDoeren is preparing to start his fifth season at N.C. State and parts of his speech and story could also have been told of Monday's inductees Pat Crawford, Cheryl Littlejohn, Bobby Reynolds, Koren Robinson and Duane Ross.\n\nLike Crawford, who ended up in the major leagues after beginning his professional career as a school teacher and coach, Doeren originally thought sports would be vehicle to something else.\n\nDoeren attended Drake University with the intention of going to medical school while Crawford simply wanted to teach.\n\n\"His life goal wasn't to be a professional athlete,\" said Crawford's grandson Tim Crawford, who inducted his grandfather. \"He wanted to be a teacher and help make young men have better lives.\"\n\nLike Littlejohn and Reynolds, teachers and coaches were Doeren's inspiration. Littlejohn can recall the names of all of her teachers from Gastonia's Rhyne Elementary School and Reynolds remembers the coaching methods of his coaches from junior high through high school.\n\nDoeren's grandfather was a longtime coach and college football referee.\n\n\"When people say, 'Who inspired you?' the answer is easy for me,\" Littlejohn said. \"It was my school teachers.\"\n\nSaid Reynolds: \"I was so blessed to have men like junior coach Steve Bowen, high school coach Henry Jones and Legion coach Don Saine help shape my life.\"\n\nLike Ross, who's track career eventually made him Gaston County's only Olympic athlete, Doeren values teaching discipline whenever possible.\n\n\"It's not easy pursuing something when it's hard,\" said Ross, now a track coach at North Carolina A&T. \"You've got to work harder than you ever imagined you can work.\"\n\nSaid Doeren: \"When I grew up, the teacher was right and the coach was right - even you didn't like it. When I recruit a kid today, I tell him and his parents, 'My job is to get the most out of you and your job is to let me.'\"\n\nAnd like Robinson, who played at N.C. State from 1998 to 2000, Doeren recognizes the loyalty you get from Wolfpack fans.\n\n\"Our identity is to play hard, play tough and play together,\" Doeren said. \"I first heard that from (All-Pro San Diego Chargers quarterback) Philip Rivers when he came back to speak to our team.\"\n\nSaid Robinson, who was the top receiver during Rivers' ACC rookie of the year freshman season of 2000: \"Like coach Doeren said, the atmosphere and experience of being around N.C. State is special. You just have to experience it to understand.\"\n\nRemembering their coach\n\nLisa Webb Kimbrough and Littlejohn both talked of their late Hall of Fame coach Pat Head Summitt, who died of Alzheimer's on June 28, 2016\n\n\"Cheryl and I had the great privilege of playing for the late great Pat Summitt,\" said Kimbrough, Who played at Tennessee from 1983 to 1988 and was an assistant for Summitt during the 1989 national championship season.\n\nLittlejohn said she and Kimbrough were together for their last visit with their coach.\n\n\"It's been about a year since she died and her death affected a lot of women,\" Littlejohn said. \"When Lisa and I went to see her, she didn't know us. But we knew who she was and we were so proud that she wasn't ashamed of her disease.\"\n\nGenerational teaching\n\nSince Reynolds' coaching career began in his hometown of Cherryville shortly after his graduation from UNC-Wilmington in 1986, it's allowed him to coach generations of players from the same family - including his own.\n\n\"He hasn't changed and he's still been successful through whatever changes have come to the game,\" said his son and inductor Drew Reynolds. \"Now that I coach with him (at East Rutherford High), I can hear him telling my cousin (Wes Reynolds) some of the same things he told me when I was playing for him.\"\n\nBobby Reynolds said that dawned on him recently during a Legion game when he was talking about a play with current Cherryville Post 100 player Dayne Homesley.\n\n\"I yelled, 'Kelly, you know you have to hit that pitch!,'\" Reynolds said. \"And he came to me and said, 'Kelly is my dad. I'm Dayne.'\n\n\"So it really makes you realize how long you've been coaching when you can't get the names right.\"\n\nLongtime friends\n\nFormer South Point High and Lenoir-Rhyne player Kelly Brown inducted Robinson.\n\nRobinson lived with Brown and his family in Belmont during Robinson's three years as a standout player for the Red Raiders.\n\n\"Koren is still the greatest athlete I've ever seen or played with,\" said Brown, who played wide receiver at South Point (1995-97) and Lenoir-Rhyne (1998-2001). \"And everybody remembers Koren for all of that talent. But I know him as a great person, a great friend, a great husband and great father.\"\n\nLong trip, short viewing\n\nOne of Ross' North Gaston teachers, Jana Lefevers, inducted him.\n\n\"We've been close for a long time,\" Lefevers said of Ross. \"So close that I'd drive all the way to Clemson to watch him do something that lasts only 10 seconds.\"\n\nRoss was a three-time All-American hurdler and 1995 NCAA national championship in the 110-meter hurdles whose 13.32-second clocking in that event was a school record for 18 years.\n\nLefevers also said she's glad Ross didn't take her advice about his career.\n\n\"Since he was so fast, football teams were looking at him and he asked me if he should go after a football or track career,\" Lefevers said. \"I thought it was a no-brainer since football is so much bigger. I'm so glad he didn't listen to me on that.\"\n\nTitle duo\n\nThe only two college basketball national championship players from Hunter Huss were in attendance at Monday's banquet in Littlejohn and rising college senior Aaron Rohlman.\n\nLittlejohn became the county's lone NCAA Division I women's basketball national championship player in 1987 for Tennessee and Rohlman joined former Ashbrook standout James Worthy (1982 North Carolina) as the county's only NCAA Division I men's basketball national championship players this spring for North Carolina.\n\nAnother Huss graduate, Sylvia Rhyne Hatchell, is the area's lone NCAA Division I coaching national champion (1994 North Carolina women's basketball).\n\nOther county national college basketball champions are in the NCAA Division II and junior college ranks - Gastonia Ashley's Dave Robbins caoched Virginia Union to three national titles and Bessemer City's Tony Byers (1972 Vincennes), North Gaston's Chastity Friday (1992 Louisburg), Ashbrook's Justin Taylor (2013 Louisburg) and Forestview's Shannon Smith (2013 Trinity Valley) won junior college national titles.\n\nPassing along praise\n\nAs a coach since 1987, Reynolds has coached several future coaches.\n\nHe rattled those names off during his speech - Forestview High baseball coach Brian Horne, Ashbrook High baseball coach Josh Cobb, Hunter Huss High baseball coach Tripper Crisson, Cherryville High baseball coach Scott Heavner, Bessemer City High baseball coach Philip Russ, Burns High baseball coach David Wise, West Lincoln High softball coach Tyler Sain, Smoky Mountain High baseball coach Jeremy Ellenburg and Gastonia Grizzlies manager (and Lenoir-Rhyne assistant) Evan Wise.\n\nReynolds also talked about how his coaching success is due to his own assistant coaches and players.\n\n\"You're only as good as your assistants and players,\" said Reynolds, who is the state's all-time winningest American Legion baseball coach. \"You don't win a race with a donkey. You've got to have some horses.\"\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22\n\nGolf tournament\n\nA team of Doug Cochran, Kevin Collier, Bryan Hough and Wayne Kenley took top honors at Monday morning's best-ball Gaston County Sports Hall of Fame golf tournament at Charlotte's Pine Island Country Club with an aggregate score of 53.\n\nThe second-place team of Kelly Brown, Bryant Cherry, Kent Cherry and 2017 GCSHOF inductee Koren Robinson shot a 55 and the third-place team of Steve Bowen, George Ratchford, Eric Ruth and Dean Starling shot a 57.\n\nOther superlative winners were longest drives on No. 1 (Jason King) and No. 11 (Dylan Hastings), closest to the pin on No. 4 (Kevin Collier), No. 8 (John Freeze) and No. 17 (D.J. Holt) and longest putt on No. 13 (Donnie Loftis).\n\nNotes\n\nThere were several special guests at Monday's banquet, among them were several high school coaches, former Hall of Fame inductees, current PGA golfer Harold Varner III (of Forestview), Carolina Panthers linebacker Zeek Bigger (of Ashbrook), former college football players (N.C. State's Rufus Friday of Hunter Huss and Northwestern's Kelby Brown), former college basketball player and longtime N.C. state senator (Gastonia's Marshall Rauch, who played at Duke in the 1940s), current college football student assistant (North Gaston's Alex Patton at N.C. State), former college basketball coach Susan Yow (Belmont Abbey and Queens), current Charlotte Touchdown Club chairman Al Jacobs (of Hunter Huss) and current NBA Charlotte Hornets part-owner Andy Warlick (of Gaston Day)....\n\nThe high school coaches in attendance were new South Point head football coach Adam Hodge, Hunter Huss head football coach Jamar McKoy, North Gaston head football coach Mike Patton, Forestview head football coach Chris Medlin and Kings Mountain athletic director Mark Latham....\n\nThe former Hall of Fame inductees in attendance were Larry Rhodes (1979), Don Saine (2007), Gayle Waldrop Fulbright (2008), Harold Stowe (2010), Doug Hoffman (2011), Francis Essic (2013) and Phil Tate (2015)....\n\nEvent emcee Jesse Caldwell was one of few in attendance who had actually met the late Crawford, who died in 1994. Caldwell met Crawford at his old Camp Morehead in Morehead City and Caldwell said his mother can recall Crawford's successful 1920s coaching tenure at Gastonia's old Ashley High....\n\nDoeren was able to poke fun at perhaps his most painful loss as N.C. State football coach. \"I think (Clemson coach) Dabo Swinney should send me some of his bonus because of a missed kick,\" said Doeren, whose Wolfpack missed a potential game-winning field goal late in regulation of what turned into a 24-17 overtime loss....\n\nLittlejohn said Doeren's recruiting pitch for his program got her excited. \"I'm a basketball fan from the SEC,\" Littlejohn said. \"But after that speech, I want to play for you.\""
