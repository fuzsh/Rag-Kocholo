        "text": "RALEIGH — Philip Rivers walked into a room at the Murphy Football Center on Friday afternoon and wanted it to be just like old times.\n\n“Let’s pretend like it’s a big win,” he said.\n\nSure enough, one of the most popular athletes in the history of North Carolina State is back for a couple of days to take part in football alumni gatherings that are set in conjunction with this afternoon’s annual spring game.\n\nStill looking youthful and displaying the type of excitement that he did when he arrived as an early-entry freshman in 2000, Rivers said he embraced the chance to return and reconnect.\n\n“Shoot, I’ve long wanted to come back,” he said, pointing out that the family’s spring break trip to Florida made this more feasible.\n\nRivers has cultivated a long NFL career with the San Diego Chargers. The six-time Pro Bowl selection suggested that he has plenty of snaps left before he walks away.\n\nFinding time to return to Raleigh, though, has been troublesome.\n\n“It’s so far to go with our big family,” he said.\n\nRivers and his wife, Tiffany, have eight children.\n\nEven in the football center’s parking lot before he made it inside, the topic of size of Rivers’ family was broached by former players who happened to be among the first to greet him.\n\nRivers, 34, provided vivid recollections of his first collegiate game, a 38-31 double-overtime victory against Arkansas State on a rainy Saturday night at Carter-Finley Stadium. That was just the beginning as he touched on many highlights with the Wolfpack.\n\n“All 51 games and those four years,” he said.\n\nHe noted differences and similarities from his time for N.C. State, which was then coached by Chuck Amato.\n\n“Just pulling in and seeing that big indoor (practice facility),” Rivers said. “But a lot of it hasn’t changed. The (football center) building still looks so new.”\n\nThe stadium has undergone significant upgrades since he played. He remembered “coming out of that old tunnel and that old scoreboard.”\n\nShortly after arriving Friday, he chatted with Clayton White and Dantonio Burnett — both former teammates now on the football staff at his alma mater. He expected more fond memories to flow by the end of the weekend.\n\n“When you get with the guys, they’ll bring up many more that you’ve forgotten about,” he said.\n\nRivers is partaking in football alumni activities much like others, just that his returns have been so infrequent that it seems unique.\n\n“Maybe they’ll let me throw one more pass to Jerricho,” he said of receiver Jerricho Cotchery, who was a classmate at N.C. State and also has had an extended NFL career.\n\nDuring the whirl-wind visit, Rivers said he would hope to ride by his former apartment. He was married and his first child was born while he was in college.\n\n“It still feels like home,” he said. “It’s our early home.”"
