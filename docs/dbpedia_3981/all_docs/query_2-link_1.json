        "text": "If you’re from my generation of NC State fans—let’s call us the, uh, distinguished millennials—then your formative Wolfpack sports memories likely center around Philip Rivers and Julius Hodge.\n\nRivers and Chuck Amato basically created State football culture out of thin air, while Hodge got the basketball team back in the NCAA tournament after a decade of squalor, and with both of those programs suddenly finding success at the same time, it was like we’d won the lottery.\n\nBut let me tell you about everything else. I was in the Student Wolfpack Club in college, because that was the best way to get good seats for basketball and football, and in order to get priority for good seats for those games, you had to earn points by going to non-revenue sports games—for at least one hour. Then you could leave. And everyone did.\n\nEverybody. There was not much the athletics department could hang its hat on—the highlight for all of us was women’s hoops, which admittedly was waning toward the end of Kay Yow’s tenure, and baseball was fine, but basically every other sport promised an unpleasant experience. We appreciated volleyball games because the volleyball team was going to lose 3-0 most nights; they got everybody in and out of there with incredible efficiency.\n\nPeople would show up to soccer games with homework and just do that to pass the time. The men’s team eventually got so fed up about this that they’d come over as we were leaving and talk shit. (Not that I blame them.)\n\nWhen I look back on all of that, I see a department that generally just did not care—it’s not just that NC State lacked funds or facilities relative to its peers, which it still does, but the mood of indifference was appalling. If you weren’t men’s basketball or football, then hey, whatever, there were only so many dollars to go around.\n\nYou can get a lot done with a modest amount of care and attention to detail. If you have a shrewd eye for good coaching, then all the better. NC State doesn’t have the financial resources of many of its peers, but it does have the advantage of great location and has tons of additional things to leverage with smart people who are keen to do so working to actually do so.\n\nWhat’s happened to NC State in the time since Debbie Yow was hired as athletics director is nothing short of amazing to me—it shouldn’t be, but see above—and all those times watching a pointless volleyball game or whatever unpleasant thing was on the schedule that particular week has helped me appreciate how good it is now.\n\nNC State has established dynasties within the ACC in multiple sports—women’s cross country, wrestling, men’s swimming, women’s basketball—over the last decade, which is kind of absurd to me. And we get to lean on these things and enjoy them every year.\n\nThey’re just always there, as part of the wider NC State sports universe. Pick a week and there’s probably something good going on. The women’s tennis team, which just played for the national title—this is the most incredible development of the last 20 years IMO—is out there being very good again, for example.\n\nWhen you add a couple basketball Final Fours into all of this? This shit is amazing. Don’t forget that."
