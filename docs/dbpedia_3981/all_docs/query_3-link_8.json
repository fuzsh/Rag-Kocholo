        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. – One of the most popular players in NC State football history as decided to hang up his NFL cleats. Quarterback Philip Rivers (2000-03) will call it an NFL career after 17 seasons in the league, and leaves the game ranked among the all-time NFL passing leaders.\n\nDrafted with the #4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft by the N.Y. Giants, and traded to the then San Diego Chargers on draft day, Rivers played 17 NFL seasons and started each and every game dating back to the 2006 season. He spent the first 16 years of his career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, before playing with the Indianapolis Colts this past season.\n\nHe was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and was named the 2013 NFL Comeback Player of the Year when he led the NFL in completion percentage (.695).\n\nRivers ends his NFL career with the fifth-most passing yards in NFL history (63,440), the fifth-most passing TDs (421), the fifth-most passes completed (5,277), and the 12th-best passer rating (95.2).\n\nRivers' 240 regular season consecutive starts in his career ranks third in NFL history, second among QBS. That total increases to 252 games when adding in playoff games.\n\nRivers led his team to the playoff seven times, and made 12 playoff starts. The Chargers advanced to the AFC Championship game his second season as their starter in 2007.\n\nIn his final season in 2020 with the Indianapolis Colts, Rivers threw for 4,169 yards, his eighth straight season over 4,000 yards, and also 24 touchdowns in the regular season and the Colts went 11-5 to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nFormer NC State teammates on Philip Rivers:\n\n\"Philip was the ultimate leader, competitor, and teammate. His energy and excitement about the day's work was infectious. He is a great man and friend that brings out the best in all of those who encounter him. I will always treasure the four years we had together at NC State, the high school competitions we shared as opponents on the basketball court and gridiron, and all the many moments of laughter he brought into the locker room. Congrats to him on a wonderful career and the beginning of a new chapter.\" - wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery (2000-03)\n\n\"Philip is one of the best people and leaders I've ever had a chance to be around. His personality is contagious and the entire Wolfpack family is proud of his contributions to football and our program.\" – linebacker Dantonio Burnette (1999-02)\n\n\"Philip 'Cheez' Rivers is one of the most competitive people I know. Whether is was 3rd-and-4 against Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl or attempting to do more bench press reps than all of the DBs during spring workouts, he competed to WIN. With him as my teammate and QB, I always knew we had a chance to WIN! Congratulations to Philip on an outstanding football career. I'm certain his endeavors post career will be equally successful.\" - safety Terrence Holt (1999-02).\n\n\"Phil was one of the best leaders I've ever been around. He made everybody around him better. When he was in the huddle, we always believed we would win. I'm proud to have been his teammate and even prouder to be his friend.\" – center Jed Paulsen (2001-04)"
