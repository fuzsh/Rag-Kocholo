        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. — Devin Leary tugs his sock down, so the not-exactly-faded pink scars can show. There’s one on the inside of his left ankle and another on the outside. They’re reminders of what he’s endured to get here, proof that it wasn’t easy. Far from it.\n\nSome college football career trajectories follow straight lines: highly touted prospect arrives, starts, plays well, team wins, everyone gets their happy ending. Others are like Leary’s.\n\nIt’s been a tale of twists and turns for one of the best high school quarterbacks in New Jersey history, who set multiple state records and was a two-time Gatorade Player of the Year. At NC State, he has been a backup. He has lost his starting spot due to COVID-19 contact tracing, only to win it back, only to suffer a season-ending injury. He has endured isolation and rehabilitation and everything that comes with it.\n\n“I think, before, I was just so anxious to be the starter, so anxious to be successful at the position,” Leary said. “I was pressing more than I needed to, but it was just because I wanted to be as good as I could be and be the best teammate I could be.\n\n“When I saw what an injury could take away, it was like it didn’t matter what I thought in the past. Like, I’m here today. I get to practice today. I’m going to enjoy this. … If I can embrace that every day, I’m not going to have any regrets.”\n\nAnd finally, Leary is having the on-field success he always dreamed about. He led NC State to a 9-3 season last fall, with a stunning 35-5 touchdown-to-interception ratio. He delivered a thrilling double-overtime win over Clemson and a wild fourth-quarter comeback to beat North Carolina. Now Leary and his teammates have a legitimate chance to break a 42-year ACC championship drought this fall.\n\nWolfpack head coach Dave Doeren believes Leary is the best quarterback in the country. Leary believes he can be even better than he was a season ago. If that’s the case, it may be more than just the ACC championship this team gets to play for.\n\nAnd Leary will think about what it took to get here. Pink scars and all.\n\nLeary is a wildly competitive person. His mother Lorie noticed this about her son at a young age. They’d be playing the card game Crazy Eights and all the high cards would strangely go missing … only to be discovered at an opportune time by Devin.\n\nBut of course the Learys had competitive card games. They were a family that really, really loved sports. Devin’s father and uncle played football in college, and each of Leary’s four siblings played something growing up. (His brother Donovan is about to be a freshman quarterback at Illinois.) One of the first toys Devin received as a baby was a football.\n\nHe played football, baseball, hockey and some pickup basketball. He wrestled; that one wasn’t his favorite, but his parents didn’t raise quitters, so whatever any of the kids started, they had to finish. Leary had to wrestle for the full season.\n\nHis uncle coached football at another high school in the district where the Learys lived. He’s the one who taught Devin how to throw a football, so of course it worked out that Devin’s first start as a freshman at Timber Creek came against his uncle’s team. (“We won,” Devin would like to point out.)\n\nAs a sophomore, Leary attended a camp at NC State along with some high school teammates. His performance drew the attention of then-Wolfpack assistant George McDonald, who recruited New Jersey. Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Eli Drinkwitz liked him right away, telling Leary he’d evaluate him during his junior season and get back to him. Which he did. “Once we got the commitment, we had to hang on,” Doeren said. “He went from three stars up, especially as he got invited to Elite 11 and things like that.”\n\nDrinkwitz, now the head coach at Missouri, remembers zeroing in on Leary as the guy to take the baton from Ryan Finley, the starting quarterback at the time. There were similarities in terms of style and accuracy, but Drinkwitz felt Leary had a bigger arm.\n\n“He had elite arm talent,” said Drinkwitz. “Sometimes you just don’t overanalyze. He’s got great arm talent. He’s played at a high level. His team is winning. Once he figures it out at the top of the college level, he’s going to be able to do the same things.\n\n“In our system, this was a guy who really fits and could really excel.”\n\nLeary checked all the boxes: mentally and physically tough, loved the sport, didn’t turn the ball over at a high rate, accurate, had leadership qualities. Leary finished his career at Timber Creek as the state of New Jersey’s all-time leader in passing yards (9,672) and touchdowns thrown (117). Wolfpack teammates say they’ve seen him throw the ball 80 yards in the air.\n\nBut he’s more than just a big arm.\n\n“He just kind of has that ‘it’ factor, like you saw him late in those games (against Clemson and North Carolina in 2021),” Drinkwitz said. “Nothing fazes him. He’s got a lot of confidence in himself.”\n\nThat made Leary’s freshman year challenging, though. He’d never not played before. He’d never not started. Doeren said he “looked at him as the future after Ryan, but you never really know how long it’s going to take a guy to play.”\n\nLeary wasn’t a very good redshirt quarterback, Doeren said. He sees it sometimes with players who’ve always been the best player on their teams, that they struggle in their transition to college football. It was really hard for Leary, who now had to focus on running the scout team and putting on muscle. On calls with his father, he wondered what was taking so long; his dad told him he had to learn the playbook and that his time would come. Lorie says it was a humbling time for her son. “He wanted to climb and climb and climb as fast as he possibly could with no patience,” she said.\n\n“You kind of get a reality check,” Leary said. “You realize, OK, maybe you aren’t as a ready as you thought you were.”\n\nHe sat in on meetings, learning what he could from Finley, who would eventually become a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. He gained about 15 pounds in the weight room. He tried to channel his frustration into something productive.\n\nLeary again found himself on the bench early in 2019. He tried to stay positive and prepare like he was starting, no matter how hard that was. It worked, and he soon became the first redshirt freshman quarterback to start a game for NC State since Russell Wilson did it in 2008. Leary started the final five games of the season.\n\nThe stars were finally aligning.\n\nAfter the 2019 season ended, Doeren called Leary into his office and told him he’d be treated like he was going to remain the starter.\n\nSo as Leary and his teammates endured the first few months of the pandemic and wondered whether there would be a college football season, Leary was operating under the assumption it was his job to lose. That motivated him throughout workouts and practices once they began again.\n\n“In my mind, I was the quarterback of this team,” he said. “And then two weeks before our first game, I got contact traced, and that put me into a 14-day quarantine. I never tested positive for COVID, which still bothers me to this day.”\n\nLeary video-conferenced in to quarterback meetings from his apartment. At one point — even though he wasn’t supposed to — he snuck outside to a park and threw to a couple of receivers who were also in quarantine but testing negative. He hoped he could come back to the team and pick up where he left off.\n\nBut it wasn’t the only time Leary had been contact traced, having missed an earlier 14-day chunk due to another quarantine. Second-string quarterback Bailey Hockman, who had been able to practice the whole time, would start the season. New offensive coordinator Tim Beck had barely seen Leary throw a football live at this point. The quarterback also missed a scrimmage due to quarantine, so Beck hadn’t even seen him play in a simulated game.\n\n“It’s not that we didn’t want to start Devin,” Doeren said. “I would have been setting him up to fail. It was hard for him to hear, but I think he respected the fact that the other kid had been to every practice and gave us the best chance to win at the time. Not because he was a better player than Devin, but because he was more ready because of what Devin had endured.”\n\nLeary came off the bench during the season’s second game against Virginia Tech and started the next three games — a win at then-No. 24 Pitt, a win at Virginia and then a game at home against Duke. Leary was completing 60 percent of his passes as the Wolfpack began to roll.\n\nBut in the third quarter against the Blue Devils, one slide changed everything.\n\nThe trainers rushed onto the field and over to Leary, telling him over and over not to move his neck. They worried about a head injury or worse, based on the hit.\n\n“I was like, ‘My neck is fine — I just can’t feel my leg,’” Leary remembered.\n\nHe had read the play right, but he didn’t slide well. He got about five yards, felt Duke safety Lummie Young coming down on him and tried to brace himself with a slide. Young hit Leary head-on — and got a penalty for it — and his weight collapsed on Leary’s left leg. Something snapped.\n\nLeary looked down. His foot was dangling. He would need an air cast and a cart off the field.\n\nLorie and Glen Leary were sitting up in the stands on the same side of the field when their son went down. Lorie immediately worried about a concussion because of the way Devin’s head had snapped back. A team official found them and directed them to the locker room.\n\n“All I kept saying was, ‘Thank God it’s just a leg. We can fix a leg, Devin. It’s fixable,’” Lorie said. “Sometimes you can’t come back from an injury. But this is a leg. This is fixable.”\n\nLeary had broken his left fibula, which required surgery. He also underwent the ankle procedure known as “TightRope” surgery, made famous by Tua Tagovailoa. Even now, Leary has a plate and some buttons in his leg. The surgeries effectively ended Leary’s season, and they set the stage for what would be a six- to eight-month recovery process.\n\n“We were all devastated because he was doing so well, he’d finally had his chance … and then this happens,” Lorie said. “I just kept telling him it’s a bump in the road, that he could come back from this. I felt so bad for him because he’d finally gotten to the place he’d wanted to get to, and then — bam! — it’s gone.”\n\nLeary had never suffered a serious injury before. He had never endured rehabbing in the midst of the regular season, while the world keeps spinning without you. The Wolfpack medical team, which groups injured players as either short- or long-term absences, assigned Leary to the long-term injury group.\n\n“It can be very isolating, and it can be very mentally challenging,” Leary said. “Your team has to prepare each and every week. The season goes on. Teams are still going to come play. We still have to win games. You can’t necessarily focus so much on the guys that can’t help you.\n\n“You have to become mentally strong to understand that concept and know that your worth for the team, as hard as it sounds, isn’t really there.”\n\nLeary relied on his teammates in the long-term injury group, guys who also understood that feeling. He learned a bit about orthopedics so he could understand why he was doing certain exercises and how they’d help his ankle and leg heal. He watched a lot of film, working mentally through various defensive schemes and game situations.\n\nHe spent six weeks on a scooter. A couple of sharp left turns led to tumbles; as soon as the scooter started tipping left, Leary knew he’d go down. Eventually, Leary upgraded to a walking boot, and soon he could walk again without it. He’d lost a lot of muscle in his calf and quad by that point, and much of his endurance in general. Leary had to get used to running like he’d had to get used to walking again. Coaches noticed that the player who had been so down and so isolated was starting to look and sound like himself.\n\n“As he got healthier and he could see the light at the end of the tunnel, I think that changed him back again to who he was,” Doeren said.\n\nLeary was fully cleared to participate by spring ball in 2021, which set him up for his first actually normal offseason and season as the starter. After all that time and so many setbacks, he finally had the reins of his offense.\n\nThe results were fantastic. He threw for 3,433 yards and 35 touchdowns with just five interceptions. Every quarterback in the country who threw more touchdowns last season threw at least six interceptions. Leary also completed more than 65 percent of his passes.\n\nIn the last 10 years, there have been just four other FBS quarterbacks to throw at least 35 touchdown passes and no more than five interceptions: Mac Jones (2020), Justin Fields (2019), Cody Kessler (2014) and Marcus Mariota (2014). Leary is the only quarterback in ACC history to hit the 35-5 threshold in a season.\n\n“You don’t want your quarterback to lose the game,” Doeren said. “It took a while to get down into that point, and I think once we got him to that point, then his arm could shine. That’s really where things started to change. … He protects our defense, not just by scoring points and making nice throws that only he can make, but by not putting us on the short field on defense.\n\n“If, at the end of the drive, we punt, obviously it’s not ideal, but that’s a lot better than an interception. I think the hardest thing for a guy like Devin who can really throw the football is he thinks he can throw every pass anywhere he wants and make the perfect throw. Sometimes that equals interceptions. Like, this one isn’t worth the risk, and I think he’s learned that. His processing speed has gone way up.”\n\nBeck says there’s an “internal swagger” inside of Leary that leads him to believe he can fit any ball in any space. But he’s seen Leary evolve and understand that; he specifically points to the game against Clemson last fall as a great example of Leary’s decision-making in the run-pass-option game and his ability to read coverages.\n\nThat Clemson game proved to be an all-time moment for the Wolfpack program, which had lost eight in a row against the Tigers and 15 of their last 16 meetings. As Doeren said after the thrilling double-overtime win highlighted by Leary’s 22-yard touchdown toss to Devin Carter in the back right corner of the end zone, the curse had been broken. The fan base with more than its fair share of objectively wacky and immeasurably painful losses had something amazing to celebrate.\n\n“He’s the same guy in the first quarter as he is in double overtime,” Doeren said. “The plays he made right then are the same plays you see him making in practice working on the two-minute drill. That was a great sequence for him with Devin Carter but, going back to when we beat Pitt at Pitt in 2020, it was the same thing. A two-minute drive takes us down the field, fourth-and-10, converts, throws a touchdown to Emeka Emezie to win the game.\n\n“Jacoby Brissett and Ryan Finley were both really good players here. They’re both in the NFL. But neither of them had game-winning drives like that when they were here. When that happened (against Pitt), I was like, this dude is different. Not that they weren’t great — they were — but he was different. He could perform at the end of the game the way you hope a guy could. Then he did it against Clemson in arguably one of the biggest wins in program history. Then he did it again against UNC to score two touchdowns in 26 seconds.”\n\nIn the chaos that unfolded on the field after the win over Clemson, Leary found his head coach and hugged him. His brain went straight back to his second start, in 2019, when he told Doeren he was going to beat Clemson. It was bold and ultimately two years too early, but his coach loved it.\n\n“That’s what I want,” Doeren said. “I want my quarterback to feel that way. I want him to be 100 percent confident, not cocky but confident that he can lead our team to beat anybody that we play.”\n\n“I manifested it,” said Leary.\n\nNow it’s time to manifest the goals for the 2022 season.\n\nNC State needs to replace quite a bit of talent, from stud offensive tackle Ickey Ekwonu, who was drafted No. 6 overall by the Carolina Panthers, to Emezie, Leary’s top target last season. The offense is also breaking in some new running backs.\n\nThe key to everything, Beck says, will be a great relationship with the offensive line.\n\n“I tell quarterbacks all the time that they’ve got to want to play for you,” Beck said. “Devin Leary is our goalie. The offensive line is the hockey team. Nobody messes with the goalie. They have to feel that way about you.”\n\nThat relationship-building includes shared meals. Hugs. Appreciation. It’s not that different from how Leary makes sure to spend time with his receivers and gets to know young players at all the skill positions. Leary is a serious guy, but he knows he can loosen up around his teammates.\n\nHis parents have proof that this side of their son exists. Lorie says he’ll kill her for sharing this but back when Devin was in kindergarten, he was a clown. The family would host Christmas parties, and the kids would get up and sing a song. Devin’s pick? “Hot in Herre,” by Nelly. “He was funny as hell as a little kid,” Lorie said, laughing.\n\nBut no one will see that side of Leary anywhere near a football field. He’s all business, especially now that everything he’s worked for is in front of him. The ACC could be there for the taking. Leary could play his way into becoming a Heisman Trophy contender and a high draft pick. More history could be made by the best quarterback no one is talking about … yet.\n\n“For whatever reason at this school, I feel like breakout years go under the radar,” Doeren said. “It takes a second year for guys to get their deserved, earned attention. I don’t understand why that would be the case here. We’ve had quite a lineage of quarterbacks at this school — Russell Wilson, Philip Rivers, it goes all the way back.\n\n“So, why did our quarterback playing like that not get that attention? It’s a great question.”\n\nIf Doeren’s theory is correct, it’ll take a second season of high-level performance to wake up the rest of the nation. He says he felt the same way about linebacker Payton Wilson coming into last season after leading the ACC in tackles in 2020. Now it’s Leary’s turn.\n\n“He’s got to do it again,” Doeren said.\n\nAnd he plans to.\n\n(Top photo: Rob Kinnan / USA Today)"
