        "text": "July 12, 2004\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. - Facing a 14-point deficit with a potential New Year's Day bowl berth on the line, the Maryland football team provided the next \"Top Terp Moment\" with a 26-24 rally past NC State on Nov. 22, 2003. The win continued Maryland's late-season surge and propelled the Terps to a second-place finish in the ACC and the Gator Bowl.\n\nTrailing by two touchdowns with just nine minutes left to play, Maryland's Scott McBrien marched the Terps down the field and hit J.J. Walker for the score to cut the lead in half. After forcing the Wolfpack to punt, the game was seemingly destined for overtime when Scott McBrien scored on a two-yard plunge. However, the Terps hopes appeared to be dashed as Nick Novak missed the extra point and Maryland trailed 24-23 with 2:20 left in the game.\n\nThe Wolfpack looked as if they were going to wrap the game up after they opened the ensuing possession with an 18-yard run by T.A. McLendon. However, on McLendon's next carry, Leroy Ambush knocked the ball loose from McLendon and the Terps pounced on the ball. Maryland moved the ball to the NC State 26 yard line, where Novak redeemed his miss and nailed the 43-yard field goal with 23 second left in the game.\n\nLate desperation attempts by Philip Rivers were unsucessful as Maryland came away with another narrow win over NC State.\n\nBelow is the recap from that game, but be also be sure to check out the complete box score and photo gallery from that game.\n\nNov. 22, 2003\n\nMaryland 26, NC State 23\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Nick Novak made a 43-yard field goal with 23 seconds left to give Maryland a 26-24 victory over North Carolina State on Saturday.\n\nThe loss spoiled senior day for N.C. State quarterback Philip Rivers, who was 16-of-30 for 276 yards and an interception. The Wolfpack also retired Rivers' No. 17 before the game.\n\nThe Terrapins (8-3, 5-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) rallied from 14 points down in the final 6:23, with Scott McBrien leading drives that resulted in two touchdowns and the field goal.\n\nMcBrien finished 17-of-37 for 243 yards.\n\nMaryland's final possession began with 1:50 left after Wolfpack running back T.A. McLendon fumbled at the N.C. State 46. It took five plays to set up Novak's winner.\n\nJosh Allen gained 144 yards on 23 carries to lead Maryland's ground game. Rich Parson caught four passes for 114 yards, while J.J. Walker caught six passes for 57 yards.\n\nJerricho Cotchery went over the 100-yard mark for the 14th time in his career with six catches for 102 yards for the Wolfpack (7-5, 4-4).\n\nThe victory gave Maryland second place in the ACC and a likely invitation to the Gator Bowl.\n\nThe Wolfpack appeared to have the game in hand when Tramain Hall returned a punt 83 yards for a touchdown and Adam Kiker added a 32-yard field goal to give N.C. State a 24-10 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nThe two teams have formed a recent rivalry with Maryland winning the last four against the Wolfpack all by seven points or less. Maryland has won eight of nine and can finish in second place in the league with a win over Wake Forest in its final regular-season game."
