        "text": "MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - A big celebration Wednesday night coinciding with the Reese’s Senior Bowl.\n\nMoe’s Original BBQ Downtown once again playing host to “Special Spectators” biggest fundraiser of the year. The non-profit gives sick children and their families all-access college game day experiences across the U.S.\n\nGuests were able to not only enjoy good BBQ and drinks -- but also listen to live music. There was also a silent auction -- where several Ridell football helmets were up for grabs -- including a half helmet featuring Rivers NC State/Chargers.\n\nThey also had a chance to meet some of this year’s Senior Bowl players and special guest -- former NFL Chargers Quarterback Philip Rivers -- who just finished up his fourth year as St. Michael’s head coach in Baldwin County. Rivers is celebrating 20 years since he played in the Senior Bowl.\n\n“I had a coach tell me once -- put all your problems in a pile... If we all did -- you’d probably just want yours back. You never know what a family and a young child is going through and Special Spectators gives them a highlight weekend -- a fun memorable weekend -- they’ll never forget,” said Rivers.\n\n“It’s really about giving these children and families a chance to walk away from whatever hard journey they’re n medically to just be a family for a minute and do something fun,” explained Beth Abston, USA Children’s & Women’s Hospital.\n\nSpecial Spectators will have a parade Friday night ahead of the Incas -- plus give kids and their families from USA Children’s & Women’s Hospital a VIP Senior Bowl Gameday experience Saturday. Half of all the proceeds stay locally at USA Children’s & Women’s."
