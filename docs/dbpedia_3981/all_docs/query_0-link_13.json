        "text": "Similar ‘States’ of Football\n\nNC State will face Mississippi State in the 2015 Belk Bowl at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte on Dec. 30 at 3:30 p.m. It's the third time the two similar schools have played against each other in postseason bowl games.\n\nHolt Brothers Bring Cancer Support Program to Campus\n\nAs football players, Terrence and Torry Holt made a lasting impact on NC State. Now, their foundation is coming back to campus to help the children of cancer patients cope.\n\nAll In\n\nOn the first day prospective NC State students could commit to making our campus their future home, Reeves Thompson wasted no time in saying yes - becoming one of the first members of the Class of 2015 to officially join the Wolfpack family.\n\nAn Inspirational Win\n\nDana Bible (right), whose battle with leukemia is well-known by Wolfpack and ACC fans alike, is a finalist for the 2011 Uplifting Athletes Rare Disease Champion Award. Bible - NC State's offensive coordinator, quarterbacks and wide receivers coach - was diagnosed in Nov. 2009 and underwent full treatment while maintaining his leadership role with the Wolfpack.\n\nWolfpack in the… Toy Department?\n\nThe competition was fierce at a local retail store, where members of the NC State football team took time out from bowl preparations to stuff shopping carts in a quest to become the team's top shopper for the Marines' Toys for Tots program. In just 45 minutes, players snagged more than $24,000 in toys to give to children in need.\n\nSunshine State of Mind\n\nNC State has accepted a bid to play No. 22 West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl at Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium in Orlando on Dec. 28. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m., with a limited allocation of tickets currently available to Wolfpack Club members and NC State fans.\n\nBuilding a Future\n\nAs the Wolfpack makes final preparations for its first game Saturday vs. Western Carolina, more than a dozen NC State football players can sit back, smile and think, \"Well, this isn't the hardest thing I've done in the last three months.\" No matter what happens on the football field, it may not be as rewarding as the volunteer work they did this summer with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nAre You Ready for Some Football Ads?\n\nWith football season three months away, a creative team is tackling NC State’s next halftime ad. Give your two cents' worth on \"Red means go\" and \"We all go to NC State\" - or suggest a new theme.\n\nBecoming Mr. Wuf\n\nZach Jones always wanted to be a hapless cartoon animal with a dangerous lifestyle and endless vitality. He was living the dream this weekend, on a quest to become the legendary Mr. Wuf. Is Zach mascot material? Follow along as the NC State freshman went under the mask, and see how his journey turned out.\n\nVoice of the Pack\n\nEd Funkhouser is regarded by his colleagues as one of the Department of Communication's top faculty members - a veteran educator with decades of experience he shares with his students. But when it's time for Wolfpack football and women's basketball games, Funkhouser moves out of the classroom and behind the microphone to communicate with fans on a whole other level."
