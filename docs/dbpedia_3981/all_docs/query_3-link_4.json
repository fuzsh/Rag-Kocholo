        "text": "RALEIGH — Chuck Amato sent a text to Philip Rivers Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Hindsight is 20/20.\"\n\nIt was a message that could've meant a lot of things to the former NC State quarterback, who after 17 years in the NFL, announced his retirement earlier that day.\n\nIt might be a playful jab from the quick-witted Amato — NC State's head coach from 2000 to 2006 — who at first wanted to change Rivers' throwing motion when he stepped onto the Raleigh campus as a freshman.\n\nIt was former Super Bowl-winning head coach Mike Holmgren, then at BYU, who convinced Amato's quarterback coach, Norm Chow, to leave it alone.\n\n\"We used to watch from the woods and laugh, all the coaches, when we watched him throw the ball as a freshman,\" Amato said, laughing. \"It was so ugly. But we didn't mess with it, and he figured things out.\"\n\nMore: 'If you don't check it, multiple times a day, you're behind': An inside look at NC State's transfer portal war room\n\nRivers left school after the 2003 season as the No. 2 all-time passer in the NCAA record books with 13,484 yards.\n\nThe text could've referenced Rivers' NFL draft experience, a trade that sent Eli Manning to the New York Giants and Rivers to the Chargers, who had selected Manning first overall. Rivers spent 16 years in San Diego before signing with the Indianapolis Colts for what would be his final season.\n\nRivers, 39, finishes his career ranked fifth all-time with 63,440 passing yards and 421 touchdown passes, leading the Colts to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth this season.\n\nRivers, who wore No. 17 throughout his 17 seasons, and for four years in college, played in 244 games, starting the final 240, a streak that is the second-longest ever by an NFL quarterback behind Brett Favre’s 297.\n\nThe true meaning of the text? A former coach lamenting to a former player about what could've been if they had one more season together.\n\n\"I told him, If I would've redshirted him his freshman year, we could've done great things if he came back for a fifth year,\" Amato said. \"We had the best defense in the country. Can you imagine? It would've been great.\"\n\nRegardless of what could've been, the two did great things while they were together in Raleigh. Most notably, the first 11-win season in program history during a 2002 season that ended with a Gator Bowl win over Notre Dame.\n\nAmato remembers the passion in which Rivers played the game of football.\n\n\"He was a ballbuster, no question about it,\" Amato said. \"He was a little crazy, but the guys around him knew how to handle it and they thrived under his passion. When he was playing, there was no question, he was the chief.\"\n\nThe two shared a close relationship while Rivers was in Raleigh, often attending Catholic mass together. Rivers even asked Amato for permission to marry his wife, Tiffany, while he was in school. Amato gave him his blessing, but not without messing with his young quarterback a bit.\n\nRivers' father, Steve, who coached him in high school, had told his son that he had to get permission from his head coach to marry his longtime girlfriend. That of course, was untrue, but Amato let Rivers dangle for a while in his office.\n\n\"I'm just not sure I can let you do it,\" Amato told Rivers. \"Where will you live? Who is going to pay the bills.\"\n\nRivers bowed his head and began to cry.\n\n\"I'm only messing with you, son!\" Amato yelled.\n\nIt's been 20 years since that moment, but Amato still remembers it fondly, a memory of a young, nervous Rivers before an NFL career that will ultimately end in Canton, Ohio.\n\n\"It was fun watching him grow up,\" Amato said. \"I got to watch him develop as a player and a person. That was special for me. We knew he was going to be great.\"\n\nDavid Thompson is an award-winning reporter for the USA Today Network covering NC State and Duke athletics.
