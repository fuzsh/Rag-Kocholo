In this brief anonymous survey, you can prioritize ways to support NC State’s mission, the university’s strengths and the traits you’d like to see in the next chancellor. ⬇️ Learn more and take the survey.\n\nThe Belk Center for Community College Leadership and Research is celebrating five years of partnering with North Carolina’s 58 community colleges to fuel success across the state. 👏 See how the NC State College of Education collaboration is just getting started.\n\nNC State athletes are winning at the #ParisOlympics. 👏 One of the most successful academic years in NC State Athletics history is drawing to a close in sparkling fashion — specifically shiny gold and silver. At the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, two former Wolfpack female athletes won medals, bringing the school’s haul to three among the record 13 Olympians from the university who have competed at this year’s Olympics. Swimmer Katharine Berkoff, a five-time NCAA champion and 30-time All-American from Missoula, Montana, won a gold medal as a member of the United States’ 4×100 medley relay team, and professional tennis player Diana Shnaider, a native of Russia, won a silver medal in women’s doubles as part of the Independent Neutral Athletes. 🔗 Read more: http://ncst.at/nAul50SVe4P\n\nRural NC State scholars are taking North Carolina’s livestock veterinarian shortage by the horns. 🩺🐄 A new North Carolina State University- College of Veterinary Medicine program is pairing vet students with livestock veterinarians in rural areas of the state to build students’ skills, create connections and address a statewide care deficit. “At the vet school, you’re one of 120,” remarks Dr. Richard Kirkman, a member of the college’s Class of 1991. “Out here, you’re one of one.” 🔗 See how the inaugural program is giving students hands-on experience: http://ncst.at/IfNt50SPJTL\n\nEven during summer break, NC State is buzzing with #ThinkAndDo energy. Chase the sun with us and see what our campus community is up to from dawn to dusk. 🌇🔗 http://ncst.at/AAEA50SOIku\n\nThis year's Olympics bill is at least $8.7 billion for #Paris2024. Does the payoff justify the investment? The International Olympic Committee claims the event creates jobs and boosts tourism and leaves behind facilities that provide lasting benefits to the community. It cites cost-benefit studies showing that the games are a net economic benefit to the host city. The truth is more complicated. NC State Poole College of Management economist Steve Allen explains. 🏅⬇️ #ThinkAndDo"
