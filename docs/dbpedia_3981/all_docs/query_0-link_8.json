        "text": "NC State Wolfpack All-Time Great and NFL Legendary Quarterback\n\nGuest Speaker for Thursday, July 15th “Legends of the Game” Speaker Series Luncheon\n\nCharlotte, N.C. – The Charlotte Touchdown Club is thrilled to announce NC State all-time great and NFL legendary quarterback Philip Rivers as one of this year’s luncheon guest speakers. The 2021 “Legends of the Game” Speaker Series Luncheon will be hosted Thursday, July, 15th in-person at the Sheraton Charlotte Hotel from 12:00pm to 1:30pm. (Silent Auction from 11:15am to 11:45am) An estimated sell-out crowd of 500 people is anticipated. PROCEEDS BENEFIT THE TOUCHDOWN CLUB SCHOLARSHIP FUND!\n\nPhilip Rivers played college football at North Carolina State and was selected fourth overall in 2004 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, who traded him to the San Diego Chargers during the draft. Rivers was a member of the Chargers for 16 seasons and played his final season for the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAs a senior at NC State in 2003, Rivers threw for 4,491 yards and 34 touchdowns in 12 games, capping his career as the most productive and durable quarterback in ACC history. During his collegiate career, Rivers shattered almost every NC State and ACC passing record. He started 51 straight games and completed a conference record 1,147 passes in 1,710 tries, with 95 touchdowns. His career culminated with an NCAA record 51st consecutive college start. The Wolfpack went to four consecutive bowl games under the leadership of Rivers, winning three of them. Rivers finished his career at NC State with 13,484 passing yards, 13th all-time among Division I quarterbacks (he finished in second place at the end of his collegiate career). He also threw 95 touchdown passes, which tied him for eighth all-time with Kliff Kingsbury and Brady Quinn. Rivers’ number was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State.\n\nRivers was a member of the San Diego Chargers for 16 seasons and played his final season for the Indianapolis Colts. After spending his first two seasons in a backup role, Rivers served as the Chargers’ starting quarterback from 2006 to 2019. During his tenure, he was named to eight Pro Bowls while leading the team to four division titles and six postseason appearances. Rivers also helped the franchise win their first playoff game since 1994 during the 2007 season, culminating in a trip to the AFC Championship Game. With the Colts in 2020, he qualified for the playoffs a seventh time as a starter.\n\nRivers ranks fifth all-time in passing yards (63,440) and touchdowns (421). He is also second all-time in consecutive regular season starts by a quarterback at 240, having started every regular season game between 2006 and 2020.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, Rivers announced his retirement from the NFL after seventeen seasons, saying “It’s just time. It’s just right.” He announced his intention to retire with the Chargers, and reaffirmed his plans to become the head coach of the St. Michael Catholic High School football team in Fairhope, Alabama."
