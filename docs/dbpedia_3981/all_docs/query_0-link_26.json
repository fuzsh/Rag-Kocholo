        "text": "NC State football fans can catch a glimpse of the future and reconnect with links from the program’s past on Saturday at the 2016 Kay Yow Spring Football Game.\n\nNot only will former ACC Player of the Year Philip Rivers return to the stadium where he shattered school and ACC records, former All-America wide receiver Torry Holt, now retired from the NFL, will participate in the Alumni Classic Game, which begins at 10:45 a.m.\n\nThe Red and White intrasquad scrimmage—which honors Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame inductee and former Wolfpack women’s basketball coach Kay Yow—is slated to kickoff at 1 p.m. at Carter-Finley Stadium. Parking lots open at 8 a.m. and stadium gates will open at 10:30 a.m.\n\nPerhaps of most interest for fans is checking out the replacements for two-year starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who finished his career by leading the Wolfpack to a 7-6 overall record and an appearance in the 2015 Belk Bowl in Charlotte. Last year, as a red-shirt freshman, Jalan McClendon saw action in seven games behind Brissett. He’s competing with redshirt freshman Jakobi Meyers in the spring for the starting job.\n\nA full list of activities are scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Admission is free, but a $1 donation to benefit the Kay Yow Cancer Fund is requested from all who attend.\n\nRivers, set to begin his 13th season with the San Diego Chargers this fall, last visited campus in 2012, when he was the spring commencement speaker at PNC Arena. Though he’s lived on the West Coast with his family—which has grown to six daughters and two sons since he left Raleigh—Rivers says he still follows the Wolfpack football program as closely as ever.\n\nHolt, who put up hall-of-fame numbers during his 11-year NFL career, won a Super Bowl ring as a rookie with the St. Louis Rams. He will join dozens of former players in the alumni game, with much ice, ibuprofen and bed rest to follow."
