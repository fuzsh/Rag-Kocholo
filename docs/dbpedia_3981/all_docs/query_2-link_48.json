        "text": "Marshall (4-0) at North Carolina State (3-2), Saturday at 2 p.m. (The CW)\n\nLine: N.C. State by 6 1/2, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nSeries record: N.C. State leads 5-0.\n\nWHAT’S AT STAKE?\n\nN.C. State has gone through a bumpy first month of the season with its new offense. That has put the burden on the defense to carry the load for a team trying to reach the eight-win mark for the fourth straight season. Marshall has a chance to hit 5-0 for the second time in the last nine seasons and enters the game with a nine-game winning streak.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nN.C. State’s passing game against Marshall’s defense. The Wolfpack’s move to a new offense under Robert Anae has sputtered early, enough so that coach Dave Doeren announced he’s going with sophomore MJ Morris as the starting quarterback instead of Virginia graduate transfer Brennan Armstrong. Marshall has the No. 2 defense in the Sun Belt Conference (20.5 points, 336.8 yards).\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMarshall: RB Rasheen Ali. The fourth-year runner had a big year in 2021 with 1,401 yards rushing while tying for the Bowl Subdivision lead with 23 rushing scores. He enters the week tied for fifth in FBS by averaging 118.8 yards rushing and in a three-way tie with a national-best nine rushing scores in four games.\n\nN.C. State: Morris. The plan was to redshirt him this year to let him develop while Armstrong served as a one-year bridge, but Doeren said his team needs a spark now. Morris led a comeback win against Virginia Tech last year off the bench, then started a win against Wake Forest as the first true freshman QB to start for the program since Philip Rivers in 2000.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nN.C. State won the last meetings in 2017 and 2018 by identical 37-20 scores. ... Marshall is going for a second win against an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent this season. The Thundering Herd beat Virginia Tech 24-17 on Sept. 23. ... Marshall won its last five games last year and hasn’t lost since falling to Coastal Carolina last October. ... Marshall opened at 7-0 in 2020 for the only time it has reached 5-0 since a 13-1 season in 2014. ... Three of the Herd’s four wins so far have come by one-possession margins. ... N.C. State is averaging 20.5 points and 307 yards in four games against FBS opponents. ... N.C. State’s Julian Gray is averaging 32 yards per kickoff return, sixth in FBS. ... N.C. State is coming off a 13-10 loss to now-No. 25 Louisville. Marshall is coming off a 41-35 win against Old Dominion.\n\n___"
