        "text": "North Carolina State University, officially North Carolina State University at Raleigh, is a public, coeducational, research university located in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. Commonly known as NC State or simply State, the university is part of the University of North Carolina system and is a land, sea, and space grant institution. The university forms one of the corners of the Research Triangle together with Duke University in Durham and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly founded the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now NC State, on March 7, 1887, as a land-grant college. Today, NC State has an enrollment of more than 34,000 students, making it the largest university in the Carolinas. NC State has historical strengths in engineering, agriculture, life sciences, textiles and design and now offers 106 bachelor's degrees. The graduate school offers 104 master's degrees, 61 doctoral degrees, and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nHistory\n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly founded NC State on March 7, 1887 as a land-grant college under the name \"North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.\" In the segregated system, it was open only to white students. As a land-grant college, NC State would provide a liberal and practical education while focusing on military tactics, agriculture and the mechanical arts without excluding classical studies. Since its founding, the university has maintained these objectives while building on them. After opening in 1889, NC State saw its enrollment fluctuate and its mandate expand. In 1918, it changed its name to \"North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering\"â€”or \"North Carolina State\" for short. During the Great Depression, the North Carolina state government, under Governor O. Max Gardner, administratively combined the University of North Carolina, the Woman's College (at Greensboro), and NC State. This conglomeration became the University of North Carolina in 1931. Following World War II, the university grew and developed. The G.I. Bill enabled thousands of veterans to attend college, and enrollment shot past the 5,000 mark in 1947.\n\nState College created new academic programs, including the School of Architecture and Landscape Design in 1947 (renamed as the School of Design in 1948), the School of Education in 1948, and the School of Forestry in 1950. In the summer of 1956, following the US Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated public education was unconstitutional, North Carolina State College enrolled its first African-American undergraduates, Ed Carson, Manuel Crockett, Irwin Holmes, and Walter Holmes.\n\nIn 1962, State College officials desired to change the institution's name to North Carolina State University. Consolidated university administrators approved a change to the University of North Carolina at Raleigh, frustrating many student and alumni who protested the change with letter writing campaigns. In 1963, State College officially became North Carolina State of the University of North Carolina. Students, faculty, and alumni continued to express dissatisfaction with this name, however, and after two additional years of protest, the name was changed to the current North Carolina State University at Raleigh. The \"at Raleigh\" part is usually omitted even on official documents such as diplomas, but is part of the school's official name.\n\nIn 1966, single-year enrollment reached 10,000. In the 1970s enrollment surpassed 19,000 and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences was added.\n\nCelebrating its centennial in 1987, NC State reorganized its internal structure, renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the College of Engineering). Also in this year, it gained 700 acres (2.8 km) of land that was developed as Centennial Campus. Since then, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus. It has invested more than $620 million in facilities and infrastructure at the new campus, with 62 acres (0.3 km) of space being constructed. sixty-one private and government agency partners are located on Centennial Campus.\n\nCurrently, NC State has almost 8,000 employees, nearly 35,000 students, a $1.01 billion annual budget, and a $884 million endowment. It is the largest university in the state and one of the anchors of North Carolina's Research Triangle, together with Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center, located in D.H. Hill Library, maintains a website devoted to NC State history entitled Historical State.\n\nCampuses\n\nMain Campus\n\nNC State's Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is mainly residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the North Carolina Railroad. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and Reynolds Coliseum.\n\nArchitecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red brick buildings. Brick statues dot the landscape and the University Plaza, colloquially named \"The Brickyard\", in Central Campus is nicknamed for its paving material, most sidewalks are also made from brick. The Brickyard and sidewalks also contain white brick mosaics of the athletics logo and other patterns.\n\nThe Memorial Tower, located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Chancellor's Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in World War I. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115 feet (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Belltower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.\n\nThe Court of North Carolina, just West of the Memorial Tower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every county in North Carolina), but damage caused by Hurricane Fran in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court's former appearance is far from being restored.\n\nSouthwest of the Court of North Carolina is another landmark, the Free Expression Tunnel. The Tunnel functions as one of three pedestrian tunnels underneath the railroad tracks separating North Campus and Central Campus. This particular tunnel is the site of sanctioned graffiti; anyone may paint there, and it is often the place for political statements, personal messages, and art. In 2008 racist and threatening graffiti directed at (then) President-elect Barack Obama prompted an investigation from the United States Secret Service. Students held a \"Unity Rally\" in response to denounce the acts of racism.\n\nCentennial\n\nNC State's main campus is augmented by the 1,334-acre (5.4 km) mixed-use Centennial Campus. Located 1 mi (1.6 km) south of the Memorial Tower, this campus houses university, corporate, and government research, in addition to classrooms and non-student residences. The College of Textiles has been based on this campus since 1991. Beginning in 2002, the College of Engineering began to relocate to Centennial Campus. Currently, six of the nine College of Engineering departments are housed in three Engineering Buildings in an area known as the Engineering Oval. The Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC), part of the College of Engineering, is located adjacent to the Engineering Oval. The offices of Red Hat, ABB, and the National Weather Service are also on the Centennial Campus, as well as Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School.\n\nCentennial Biomedical Campus\n\nThe North Carolina State University Centennial Biomedical Campus is located 2.5 mi (4.0 km) west of the NCSU Memorial Tower. North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, NC State's professional college and North Carolina's only veterinary medicine program, serves as the anchor of the Biomedical Campus. The 180-acre (0.73 km) campus consists of 20 buildings including the 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m) CVM Research Building where biomedical investigations in genomic sciences; vaccine development; cancer immuno-therapy; emerging and infectious zoonotic diseases; and diseases of the lung, respiratory tract, skin, and digestive system are undertaken. The Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with its clinical research and clinical trials, and the Teaching Animal Unit (TAU), which is a working farm, are also campus elements. The 110,000-square-foot Randall B. Terry, Jr. Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center, completed in 2011, doubled the size of the veterinary hospital.\n\nJ. C. Raulston Arboretum is an 8-acre (0.03 km) arboretum and botanical garden operated by NC State, and located just south of West Campus. It is open daily without charge.\n\nN.C. Research Campus\n\nNC State is one of eight universities with a presence at the North Carolina Research Campus, a 340-acre biotechnology hub in Kannapolis, N.C. The university operates the Plants for Human Health Institute (PHHI), a research and education organization devoted to research involving food crops, like fruits and vegetables, and the potential health-promoting properties they convey when consumed. NC State's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences staffs the institute with faculty from the departments of horticultural science; food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences; plant and microbial biology; genetics; and agricultural and resource economics.\n\nPHHI has both research and Cooperative Extension components. Dr. Mary Ann Lila is director of the Plants for Human Health Institute. As of May 2014, PHHI is home to around 50 faculty and staff at the N.C. Research Campus.\n\nN.C. State began operations in Kannapolis in 2007 as the Fruit and Vegetable Science Institute. The university was one of the first organizations to join the fledgling biotech hub that would become the N.C. Research Campus. The university's program was renamed the Plants for Human Health Institute when the N.C. Research Campus was officially dedicated on October 20, 2008, in order \"to more accurately reflect the groundbreaking research approach the institute will take. Institute research will focus on identifying and making available to consumers bioactive compounds in plants that prevent and treat disease.\"\n\nSustainability\n\nIn March 2008, NC State launched the University Sustainability Office in order to address environmental concerns on campus. The university has established a commitment to reduce its annual energy consumption per square foot by at least 4% over a 10-year period. In addition, the university has surpassed the Executive Order 156 goal of diverting 40 percent of their solid waste stream from the landfill through a variety of campus reuse and recycling programs. NC State incorporates locally grown, organic, and free range foods into dining service meals at several events such as Earth Week's EarthFest and the annual All Carolinas Meal with foods local to the Carolinas. Examinations of the campus' sustainability practices by the Sustainable Endowments Institute resulted in a \"B+\" grade for NC State on the College Sustainability Report Card 2011.\n\nAcademics\n\nStructure\n\nNC State is one of 16 campuses that constitute the University of North Carolina system. Each campus has a high degree of independence, but each submits to the policies of the UNC system Board of Governors. The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four-year terms. President Thomas W. Ross heads the system.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of NC State has thirteen members and sets all policies for the University. The UNC system Board of Governors elects eight of the trustees and the Governor of North Carolina appoints four. The student body president serves on the Board of Trustees as a voting member. The UNC system also elects the Chancellor of NC State, currently Randy Woodson.\n\nThe Board of Trustees administers NC State's eleven academic colleges. Each college grants its own degrees with the exception of the First Year College which provides incoming freshmen the opportunity to experience several disciplines before selecting a major. The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is the only college to offer associate's degrees and the College of Veterinary Medicine does not grant undergraduate degrees. Each college is composed of numerous departments that focus on a particular discipline or degree program, for example English, Computer Science, Genetics or Accounting. There are a total of 66 departments administered by all eleven NC State colleges.\n\nIn total, NC State offers nine associate's degrees in agriculture, bachelor's degrees in 102 areas of study, master's degrees in 108 areas and doctorate degrees in 60 areas. NC State is known for its programs in agriculture, engineering, veterinary medicine, and science. The textile and paper engineering programs are notable, given the uniqueness of the subject area.\n\nAcademic divisions\n\nCollege Enrollment\n\n(Fall 2011) Degrees include Undergrad Graduate Agriculture and Life Sciences 4,544 1,039\n\nAnimal Science\n\nBiochemistry\n\nPlant & Soil Sciences\n\nPoultry Science\n\nTurfgrass Management\n\nAgricultural Education & Extension\n\nDesign 584 263\n\nArt and Design\n\nGraphic Design\n\nArchitecture\n\nLandscape Architecture\n\nIndustrial Design\n\nDesign Studies\n\nEducation 880 1,254\n\nTechnology, Engineering, and Design Education (TDE)\n\nElementary Education\n\nMiddle Grades Education (Math, Science, Language Arts, Social Studies)\n\nBusiness and Marketing Education\n\nSecondary Education (Math, Science, English, Social Studies)\n\nHigher Education Admin\n\nMathematics Education\n\nSchool Admin\n\nEngineering 5,961 2,804\n\nAerospace Engineering\n\nBiological Engineering\n\nBiomedical Engineering\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nCivil Engineering\n\nComputer Engineering\n\nComputer Science\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nEnvironmental Engineering\n\nIndustrial Engineering\n\nMaterials Science and Engineering\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nNuclear Engineering\n\nPaper Engineering\n\nTextile Engineering\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences 4,147 900\n\nCommunication\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\nGerman Studies\n\nSpanish\n\nHistory\n\nAfricana Studies\n\nArt Studies\n\nInternational Studies\n\nScience, Technology & Society\n\nSelf-Design\n\nWomen's and Gender Studies\n\nPhilosophy\n\nReligious Studies\n\nPolitical Science\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial Work\n\nSociology\n\nCriminology\n\nAnthropology\n\nManagement 2,557 648\n\nAccounting\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nEconomics\n\nNatural Resources 1,321 459\n\nParks, Recreation and Tourism\n\nEnvironmental Technology and Management\n\nForest Management\n\nProfessional Golf Management\n\nSport Management\n\nSustainable Materials (formerly Wood Products)\n\nSciences 898 785\n\nMathematics\n\nPhysics\n\nChemistry\n\nStatistics\n\nGenetics\n\nMeteorology\n\nBiological Sciences\n\nTextiles 926 179\n\nFashion and Textile Management\n\nFashion and Textile Design\n\nFiber and Polymer Science\n\nTextile Engineering\n\nTextile Technology\n\nPolymer and Color Chemistry\n\nVeterinary Medicine 0 392\n\nBiomedical Sciences\n\nVeterinary Medicine\n\nImmunology\n\nFirst Year College 611 0 (Non-degree granting)\n\nAs of Fall 2010; does not include non-degree students; full list available from [1].\n\nThis list is not exhaustive; full lists are available at [2].\n\nGraduate programs are run by the respective colleges, but all graduate degrees\n\nare awarded by the Graduate School.\n\nAdmission\n\nConsidered a more selective university, NC State accepts about half of those who apply for undergraduate admission. For the class of 2014, 19,148 applied and 10,372, or 54%, were accepted. For the class of 2015, 19,634 applied and 10,372, or 53%, were accepted. The fall of 2012 saw 20,298 students apply for the class of 2016, the highest pool of applicants in the University's history. Only 10,124, or half, were accepted, an all-time-low; 4,225, or 42 percent, enrolled.\n\nMembers of the class of 2016 had average SAT verbal, math and writing scores of 591, 627 and 572, respectively, for a two-part total (verbal and math) of 1218 (1600-point scale) or a three-part total of 1790 (2400-point scale). The 4,225 students who enrolled had an average high school GPA of 4.37; 40%, or 1,678, ranked in the top 10% of their graduating classes. There were 110 valedictorians and 93 salutatorians in the class.\n\nTransfer admission is also very competitive. The mean transfer GPA was a 3.30 fall of 2008. In the fall of 2012, 3,747 students applied to the transfer class; 1,503, or 40%, were admitted.\n\nNC State does not require undergraduate admission candidates to choose a preferred college of study. After determining that an applicant meets the overall university requirements, the individual college must also agree to accept the student. Because of this process, some colleges have significantly higher admission requirements than others.\n\nThe Graduate School reviews all postgraduate education applications. For fall 2011, 14,923 prospective students applied to the Graduate School; 4,381 (29.4%) were admitted. Of these, 2,982 (68.0%) enrolled. Total fall 2011 graduate enrollment was 8,416.\n\nLibraries\n\nNCSU Libraries, ranked 38th out of 115 North American research libraries, includes 4.4 million volumes, over 50,000 print and electronic serial subscriptions, more than 20,000 videos and film holdings, and more than 40,000 digital images (as of 2011). The library system has an annual budget of over $29 million and consists of five libraries, two main libraries and three branch libraries. The D. H. Hill Library, located on Main Campus, is over nine stories tall and covers over 119 thousand square feet (11 thousand square meters). The James B. Hunt Jr. Library, located on the university's Centennial Campus, opened in January 2013 and covers over 221,000 square feet. NC State, as a member of the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN), has interlibrary loan services with Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina Central University.\n\nReputation and rankings\n\nUS News and World Report places NC State 95th out of 248 national universities in the US (43rd out of public universities). The Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities positions NC State 101st among 500 world universities in terms of scientific research leading towards a Nobel Prize in 2005, 68-85 among US universities in 2012 and 29th best university worldwide for Engineering, Technology and Computer Science, while QS placed NC State at 65th among US Universities. Furthermore, it was ranked 96th worldwide in 2009 according to Global University Ranking.\n\nNC State is rated twelfth among the nation's colleges and universities in terms of value, according to Kiplinger's Personal Finance. In 2006, NC State was ranked second by Princeton Review and fifth by U.S. News & World Report on their lists of best values among the nation's public colleges and universities. In 2012, U.S. News & World Report ranked NC State's Nuclear Engineering program 6th in the nation and its Biological & Agricultural Engineering program 5th in the nation. Additionally, U.S. News & World Report ranked NC State's Veterinary program 3rd nationally. Recently, the university was ranked 6th in the country by The Princeton Review on the list of best value for 2010 at a public university. For 2010 the Wall Street Journal surveyed recruiters and ranked NC State number 19 among the top 25 recruiter picks.\n\nScholarships\n\nThere are several notable scholarships of North Carolina State University which include:\n\nThe Park Scholarships program â€“ Made possible by generous financial support from the Park Foundation of Ithaca, New York, The Park Scholarship Program was established in 1996. Among the most prestigious undergraduate merit scholarships in the United States, the Park program pays expenses for 4 years of study at NC State, a one time computer stipend, and costs associated with enrichment activities. Approximately 30 in-state and 15 out-of-state scholarships are awarded each year to incoming freshmen at North Carolina State University. Selection is based upon scholarship, service, leadership, and character.\n\nThe Caldwell Fellows Program â€“ Created by the NC State Alumni Association to honor the legacy of former Chancellor John T. Caldwell, the Caldwell Fellows Program is a leadership development scholarship program with a strong focus on servant leadership. To be eligible, an applicant must be a full-time, first-year student at NC State University with a GPA of 3.25 or greater and meet the program's selection criteria. Caldwell Fellows are selected on the basis of strong academic performance, leadership potential, orientation toward community and service, commitment to personal growth and a demonstrated interest in and commitment to maximizing program opportunities. In 2013, North Carolina State University awarded the Baisden-Schmidt scholarship to 100 undergraduate students for their academic achievements in English studies. Students that go through the program are challenged by Dr. Caldwell's charge to \"THINK BIG\" in all their pursuits.\n\nThe Goodnight Scholars Program - Established in 2008 by the generosity of Dr. James Goodnight and Mrs. Ann Goodnight of the SAS Institute, the Goodnight Scholars Program offers students a renewable award worth $17,500 per year (renewable for up to four years). Undergraduate students eligible to be accepted into the program must be North Carolina residents; major in a science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) or education discipline; and fall in between the North Carolina-defined middle-income household bracket.
