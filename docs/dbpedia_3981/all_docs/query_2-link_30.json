        "text": "The purpose of the science program is to ensure that science and technology are used effectively in forecast and warning operations to fulfill the mission of the NWS. The utilization of science often requires research, many times with collaborative partners in NOAA, academia, and other members of the weather enterprise. Implementing science effectively requires frequent training with both atmospheric and hydrologic science as well as technology and software.\n\nHistory of NWS Raleigh Science Program and Collaborations\n\nOne of the country's strongest collaborative research relationships between a National Weather Service (NWS) office and a university started in Raleigh in the late 1970's. The process began when meteorologists from the NWS and NC State started collaborating on various projects including internships, seminars, and jointly participating in American Meteorological Society (AMS) meetings. The relationship grew during the 1980's and 1990's with projects such as the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment, the Southeast Consortium on Severe Thunderstorms and Tornadoes, and various COMET projects. In 1994, the NWS office moved and became collocated with NC State University. In the following years, NWS Raleigh co-sponsored the first AMS regional workshop for operational forecasters and hosted a National Weather Association annual meeting. NWS Raleigh has participated in three NOAA Collaborative Science, Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) projects and nearly a dozen COMET projects. The office participates in several NC State meteorology courses, a student internship course for credit, and has hosted numerous student volunteers. Research and science results have been published in several journals, presented in countless conferences, and shared with other NWS offices.\n\nA much more thorough and detailed History of the NWS Raleigh Science Program and Collaboration is available.\n\nA power point presentation illustrating the collaboration & research success between the NWS Raleigh and North Carolina State University is also available.\n\nCollaboration with NC State\n\nFor many years, the National Weather Service in Raleigh and North Carolina State University have worked together to improve forecast and warning services in the Carolinas. One result of these collaborative efforts has been a better understanding of forecast problems found in the southeast and has often resulted in operational schemes that have helped NWS meteorologists forecast these meteorological phenomena. In addition to the various research projects undertaken, the collaboration also allows students the opportunity to participate in formal internships, to work alongside forecasters, and to volunteer on various projects at the NWS office.\n\nNC State Student Course Website\n\nFive Step Process\n\nFor many years, the National Weather Service in Raleigh and North Carolina State University have worked together to study forecast problems found in the southeast. One result of this collaborative relationship have been improved operational techniques that have helped NWS meteorologists forecast these meteorological phenomena.\n\nThe transition of Research into Operations, often referred to as R2O, is a critical part of this collaborative relationship. At times the relationship takes an O2R2O framework where operational meteorologists bring problems to the researcher's attention who in turn provide improved techniques to the meteorologists.\n\nThe joint collaborations, whether they are R2O or O2R2O, are viewed as a 5-Step Process, whereby research findings ultimately are integrated into operations.\n\nStep 1 - Discover & Share (Only the beginning)\n\nStep 2 - Demonstrate added value (So what? Show me!)\n\nStep 3 - Operational Implementation (Is it practical?)\n\nStep 4 - Mastery (By all, not a few)\n\nStep 5 - Periodic review (A necessity)\n\nLarge Projects\n\nA large part of the collaboration has been facilitated with grants to support several large projects including three NOAA Collaborative Science, Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) projects and nearly a dozen Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education and Training (COMET) projects.\n\nThe latest information on these or any collaborative project is located on the National Weather Service - NC State Collaborative Research & Training Site.\n\nCSTAR Projects\n\nCurrent CSTAR Project\n\nImproving Understanding and Prediction of Hazardous Weather in the Southeastern United States: Landfalling Tropical Cyclones and Convective Storms\n\nImproving the Understanding and Prediction of Warm Season Precipitation Systems in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic Regions\n\nImproving Cold Season QPF in the Southeast U.S.\n\nTopographically-forced Weather Systems in Carolinas and Virginia\n\nCOMET Projects\n\nImproving anticipation of the influence of upstream convection on QPF\n\nInland flooding from tropical cyclones\n\nAn investigation of the inland intensification of Tropical Storm Danny\n\nSelective mesoscale analysis, research, and training (SMART) project\n\nReal-time mesoscale modeling of Carolina frontal weather\n\nNowcasting convection at Raleigh, North Carolina\n\nRegional forecast problems, local mesoscale model development: Storm Analysis Research and Training (START) Program\n\nPrediction of rainfall amounts associated with Gulf Coast hurricanes after landfall\n\nDetection of tornadic thunderstorms (Part2)\n\nDetection of tornadic thunderstorms (Part 1)\n\nCIFLOW\n\nCoastal and Inland Flood Observation and Warning Project\n\nSoutheast University Consortium for Severe Storms\n\nGenesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE)\n\nScience Infusion, Sharing and References\n\nForecast, Training, and CSTAR Workshop Presentations\n\nCollaboration Teletraining\n\nLocal Forecast and Training Presentations\n\nCSTAR Workshop Presentations\n\nCollaboration Teletraining\n\nData and Products\n\nLocal WRF Forecast Model\n\nBufkit model data for the Carolinas and Mid Atlantic - Not available at this time\n\nReal Time Predominant P-type Nomogram Plots and Partial Thickness Data\n\nText product of observed thickness values from KGSO, KRNK, and KMHX - Not available at this time\n\nEvent Summaries, Case Studies and Event Maps\n\nReferences and Conceptual Models\n\nReference - Detailed NWP configuration and setup - updated 2016/11/11\n\nReference - Basic NWP configuration and setup - updated 2016/11/11\n\nArticulate Presentation - The Dynamic Tropopause and Potential Vorticity: An Introduction - updated 2010/05/18 - Not available at this time\n\nSpeaker notes\n\nReference - Snow Banding - Types, Features and Motion - Updated 2016/05/10\n\nReference - Orographic Cirrus Forecasting Guide - updated 2011/09/28\n\nReference - Outlook for Excessive Lightning Days and Lightning First Strike\n\nReference - Tropical Cyclone Track and Intensity Model Reference - updated 2011/08/24\n\nThe TRENDs P-Type Nomogram Visualizer - a tool to effectively interpret data on the TRENDs P-Type Nomogram\n\nThe updated Partial Thickness Universal Nomogram (no labels version)\n\nCAD Types, Temperature Impacts and Erosion Composites in the Southeastern United States - Poster\n\nCAD Erosion Composites in the Southeastern United States - Poster - Not available at this time\n\nCAD Spectrum - Image\n\nCAD Classification Based on Characteristics of Parent High - Image\n\nFavored Synoptic Scale Pattern for Heavy and Light Precipitation across NC from Tropical Cyclones - Image\n\nConceptual Model of Upstream Latent Heat Release that Influenced the January 25, 2000 Heavy Snow Event across NC - Image\n\nNotes on Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Distribution across central NC - PDF\n\nNotes on Tropical Cyclone Tornadoes across central NC - PDF\n\nSoftware, Local Applications, Smart Tools, and AWIPS Procedures\n\nAWIPS Procedure to Investigate the Dynamic Tropopause and Potential Vorticity - Not available at this time\n\nAWIPS Procedure to Evaluate the Impact of Latent Heating with PV - Not available at this time\n\nAWIPS Procedure to Evaluate CAD and Coastal Fronts - Not available at this time\n\nAWIPS Procedure to Examine Cold Fronts Aloft - Not available at this time\n\nEvent Summaries, Case Studies, and Event Maps\n\nThe NWS Raleigh has a long tradition of providing event summaries and case studies for significant and unique meteorological events. The event summaries, case studies, and event maps serve many purposes including: a means to improve our meteorological understanding, a summary of the event for use as a training tool, a means to evaluate the station's performance (determining the training needs of the station and for individuals), and a review of the event for general interest needs. Our inventory of cases is well over 140 and it continues to grow.\n\nCatalog of Event Summaries, Case Studies and Event Maps\n\nScience Presentations and Posters by NWS Raleigh\n\nNWS Raleigh staff members have presented both oral presentations and poster presentations at various conferences, meetings, and workshops.
