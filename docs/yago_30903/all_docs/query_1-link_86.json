Man, when it rains, it pours!\n\nSupposedly, you should NOT be primed to at all like Faith (Roscoe's widow) when she comes on screen. Ajormay itchbay.\n\nGreat stuff coming up with Sonny and Carly, Jason and Carly, Jason and Brenda and Sonny and Jason.\n\nAlexis goes TOTALLY over the edge and Ned doesn't know what to do with her. Felicia remains a comfort.\n\nCourtney and Carly grow closer and she goes to work for Carly at the new club.\n\nJason starts to really fall for Courtney, who does end up getting a divorce, but he keeps getting thrown into some close situations with Brenda and those undeniable sparks are flying!!\n\n[AMC - What the complete hell is that thing, that popsicle stick and little girl purse that Mary is wearing around her neck???]\n\nThe rumors about a Sonny and Carly and Brenda triangle are false. In fact, Sonny and Carly end up closer than ever.\n\nCameron is there to help out Alexis.\n\nRic's visions of an explosion...does it have to do with Zander or someone rumored to be coming to town? Maybe a yacht explosion? A friend wrote to me to suggest it, then I started hearing back up! Weird!\n\nAnother friend mentioned the sparks between Skye and Scott...I'm still hearing Coleman. Sounds like they're throwing all kinds of things out there to see what sticks. :)\n\nDec 5, 2002\n\nMidweek Mini Column!!\n\nSome tidbits have come my way that I want to share with you!\n\nFirst, OLTL:\n\nOne of my very best OLTL sources has assured me that at the time of this weeks tapings, Mitch is still very much alive, so we can look forward to at least 2-4 more weeks of The Love of the Messenger being spread around.\n\nIf you bet that Keri would be having pregnancy problems before she hit mid-January, it's time to find your little gambling friends and rake in your bucks because sure enough, the health risks have hit and she's having troubles.\n\nDid you catch the sparks between RJ and Liz yesterday?? Could you miss them?? That's just the beginning! It's true! RJ is FINALLY going to get a love interest and that thin line between love and hate is just the portal!!\n\nThere's good news and there's horrible news. The good news is that the eye candy factor is about to go through the roof. I have a first hand report that the new Joey Buchanan is just yummmmmy!!! The horrible news is that he's set up with a girlfriend already. It's Jennifer \"Excuse me while I vomit so hard that last year's Christmas dinner is dislodged\" Rappaport. Why oh Why oh Why could Mitch not just kill her?? Isn't meeting her motivation enough for him??\n\nGH\n\nSadly, regretfully, [For the love of GOD would you people who have a proclivity toward hysterics NOT beat the shit out of the messenger on this one?? I'm only telling you what one of my VERY best GH sources is saying!!!] Liason is done and Brazen is in. From what I hear, it's as for sure as sure can be. Where does Jax land? On his ass, if I have my way. The good news about this is not only that we get to see good Jason-Brenda scenes, but that Journey isn't going to take another step after that Zander-Elizabeth-esque tumble into the sheets.\n\nCarly's return to the club biz isn't, as I mentioned below, a return to 101, but to a new club.\n\nChristopher Lawford [Lineage: Appeared as Charlie Brent on AMC from 92-97 and is the son of - this is for people over 35 - Peter Lawford of Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and much TV and movie association] has been cast as a senator on GH who is somehow connected to Summer.

The show will be a time travel piece that takes place in the 1920's with GH actors playing the characters. The episode will also star Gloria Stewart as the widow of a gangster.

It was very intimate family-wise. Kye and Vince brought the girls over and Ginger flew in with Natalie. We werent sure if Natalie was coming or not because she was working out some family timelines. Ginger is like a whole new person since she hooked up with Natalie. She laughs. A lot. Not hysterically or wild eyed or anything, but genuine, eye crinkling, heart warming laughter. Ive *never* seen her like that. Its odd. She has quit her job at the resort (she worked there for almost 20 years!) and is moving to Natalies town before Christmas! They are already house hunting.\n\nI managed to get some alone time with Natalie and I remain impressed. Shes smart and kind and funny and wise and I like her very much. Too bad Ginger has already snagged her (just kidding).\n\nMom did a great job making dinner and with the three girls in the kitchen helping, she didnt do too much, but didnt feel micromanaged either. It was just like old times. Vince and I threw darts and drank White Russians and ate potato skins while the girls played with a huge doll set that Ginger and Natalie brought to them. Ahhh. Idyllic.\n\nWe all ate too much. Later we all drank too much. Definitely laughed too much and everyone ended up sleeping over. The next morning, it was coffee and pancakes (courtesy of the Fabulous Kitchen Foursome again) and more laughing, then everyone went their own way again. Mom and I watched the Thursday soaps together, then both took a nap. The weekend was all about putting the herb and flower beds down for the window, which still isnt completely done. All in all, a wonderful holiday weekend. Today, I got a call from Katrina to say that a box had arrived from my on-line wife, Adrian and some of the Hos, so I tooled up there to pick it up (thanks, my darlings!!). As usual of late, it was drive up, visit for an hour, drive back and wish I had more time to spend. I really have to carve out some long term Katrina Nurture Time.\n\nSo off we go on the soap column!!\n\nAs usual, the info on OLTL and AMC is so tight it might as well have come from a bugs ass.\n\nOn AMC, we have another face to add to the ever-rotating head of Zeke McMillan in the form of Peter Francis James. Rueben Santiago-Hudson and Joe Morton have also played the part more commonly referred to as Simones Hateful Dad.\n\nAMC will be rolling out the neer seen and oft mentioned Mary Fickett again as Ruth Martin for the Christmas show.\n\nIn other news, Erica is still insufferable and sends a series of painful ice pick jabs up and down my spine.\n\nOLTL\n\nOnly Twenty-four days to go until Sylvia Miles appears on OLTL!\n\nJen is still an idiot, but now, thanks to the evil that is one of my readers, I cant NOT see her reading from cue cards in every scene. *sigh* Another one for the awards case that holds Sarah Browns flaring nostrils and Kale Browns licked to chapping lips. Add Jens darting eyes to the mix and youve got one hell of a Picasso print. Now where can I find an ear ?\n\nGH\n\nFor the most part, youve got all the info Ive got on GH, but Ill mention some of noteworthy stuff.\n\nThis showed up in my inbox from a few different readers who had seen it on Soap Zone and Media Domain. I cant vouch for the validity of it, but I think it sounds wonderful and sure, it could be the big announcement Head of ABC Daytime, Brian Frons, was rumored to be making:\n\nCAVALCADE OF STARS GUESTS ON SPECIAL GENERAL HOSPITAL CHRISTMAS SHOW\n\nPast and present stars of ABC Daytime guest on Tuesday, December 24th, as General Hospital presents Skyes Wonderful Life. Robin Christopher stars as Skye Quartermaine-Jacks, who learns what life would have been like for various members of her family had she never existed. Past, present, and future collide in this pivotal episode. It promises to be a sobering experience for the determined yet insecure Skye, who learns that her life has had more of an impact on others than she ever imagined.\n\nGuest stars include Kelly Ripa (Hayley), David Canary (Adam/Stuart), Eva LaRue (Maria), John Callahan (Edmund), Michael E. Knight (Tad), Eileen Herlie (Myrtle), James Patrick Stuart (Will), Jean LeClerc (Jeremy), Larkin Malloy (Travis), Richard Shoberg (Tom), and Susan Pratt (Barbara) from All My Children, and Linda Dano (Rae), Roger Howarth (Todd), James DePaiva (Max), Kassie DePaiva (Blair), Phil Carey (Asa), and Mark Derwin (Ben) from One Life to Live.\n\nAgain, I cant vouch for the validity of this and it could well be the product of someones overactive imagination and deep-seated desire to be a manipulative message board bastard looking for 15 minutes of fame as an ABC Press Release mimic.\n\nHey, dont write to me bitching about the rumor of a Coleman-Skye pairing! I love Coleman (big news, I know) and I love Skye (on GH, anyway). I also think both Robin Christopher and Blake Gibbons are wonderful and talented actors. They are both totally hot and I think the prospective coupling is an exciting idea! Coleman has been a smoldering ember looking for a place to land since we first saw him in this bit part and Im eager to see him unfold into the Soap Hunk hes going to be. I think Skye is just the woman to bring that out in him and I believe Skye needs someone to, *cough*, cleanse the palate a bit from White Bread Aussie Boy. In my opinion, the sooner we can get Skye with a baad boy, the better. Imagine someone that Skye can redeem! Shes so accustomed to living her life making amends for who and what she is and I think it would be great to see her in a relationship where there are no apologies and no one elses shoes to fill. Coleman has reminded me of Lukes arrival in so many ways and I definitely think he has the power and sex appeal to go the distance. As many of my readers know, I dont give my character affection away easily and this makes him a super-special dude. AJ has never demanded more of Skye than she is able to give and the two of them see one another as kindred souls. Despite his skirmishes with the law, I think Skye and Coleman can pull off the same basis of mutuality and the equal footing can definitely set off some fine sparks. Im betting theyll do that while sitting on a powder keg of passion! Bring it ON!! I had to laugh when Taggert arrested Coleman and called him Coleman as in, Coleman, youre under arrest! My girl, Skye, has been apologizing and proving herself for waaay too long in this hick town. I say let her be herself and revel in it. With a rumored pregnancy in the works, shes going to have more than a little bit to think about as far as life changes and I think RC is more than up to the job of taking us through Skyes rebirth. Guza and Pratt promised that RC would have a hot story and a hot guy if Jax blew her off for Splenda and it looks like they are going to deliver!!\n\nThe Head Writers and Steve Burton recently hinted that Liason may not be dead, but just sleeping and a source of mine claims that this Journey wont just start with one step, itll end with it. Courtney doesnt take her marriage lightly and no way should you count AJ out in this. There is a quiet lobby to keep AJ and Courtney together and it seems as though the powers that be may be listening. Yes, Jason and Courtney will hit the sheets soon, but that may end up being a turning point in a relationship OTHER than theirs! Sonny has his own thoughts about Jason sleeping with his sister and Carly is surprised to hear his half-jest that hed kill Jason if he did bang Courtney.\n\nWe wondered what would bring it on and now we know the obstacle to an annulment for Brenda and Jason. As long as they are married, they dont have to testify against one another in regard to Alcazars murder, so look for this fabulously unholy alliance to continue a while longer. Guza tried to bait us by suggesting it could turn to more. For me, I think that would be just fine. Her scenes with Carly and Jason are the times when Im happy to see Brenda on screen and since I doubt ABC Daytime is ready for a little girl-on-girl action (as is evidenced by Bianca the Chaste), my vote is for Jason and Brenda to turn those sparks to luv!\n\nYes, I do still very much want Liason and think itd be just as lovely, but I also really like her interaction with Ric. Its new, its quirky and Im willing to try it on and see if it fits. Look for more ElizaRic snags along the way before they get anything close to the batting eyes and stolen looks. Add to the fire that Jason hates him on sight and things should get fairly explosive. Maybe Ric will be the flint that causes the spark to re-ignite the Liason inferno. Jason isnt the only one getting warning bells about Sonnys new lawyer. Da Boss himself gets iggidy around his newest employee when Ric helps Carly with an ankle boo boo.\n\nCarly is tickled pink when Jaxs pending divorce puts her back in the boss chair at 101.\n\nGet ready for Zanuary, baby, because the Zan Man is going to fly into focus in a fine way. Hes got the back story. Hes got the Emily redux (but no, we arent going to get it right away, but in increments). Hes got Ric to remember explosions and see if you remember the tiny historical bits he shared with Elizabeth. Hes also got a job with the Qs!\n\nMarissa Ramirez = Out = December 4; Andrea Pearson = In = December 9th. Nik and Gias wedding plans run awry when Gia decides to be a lawyer when she grows up, before she gets married, that is.\n\nSkyes drinking hurts more than just her when she buh-bumps over Nikolas. Wonder if she backs up and hits him again?\n\nSummer and Liz share a girly moment.\n\nJason gives Skye the business.\n\nSkye confesses to exactly what she was doing with Alcazar the night he died.\n\nAlexis softens to Ned and tells him he will be an important part of Kristinas life. She goes a bit loopy, but Cameron is able to assist. She also tells Gia that she is letting her legal career go on hold until later.\n\nTHANK YOU so much to the people who have come through for us on donations for this month's bandwidth cost!
