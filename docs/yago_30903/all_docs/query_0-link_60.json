        "text": "NBC’s Today gave ABC’s Good Morning America a run for its money Wednesday in the Obamagasam department as they too fell head over heels for Barack and Michelle Obama “energiz[ing]” and “light[ing] up the convention hall....with back-to-back barn-burning speeches” “sharing the powerful, contagious power of hope, as [Michelle] described it” doubling as a “takedown” of Donald Trump.\n\nCo-…\n\nFox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett flayed George Soros’s “calamitous” criminal justice agenda in response to an MRC Special Report exposing how Soros, along with his son Alex, directs and controls 126 soft-on-crime prosecutors across the United States.\n\nJarrett spoke to MRC Founder and President Brent Bozell on the latest installment of The Brent Bozell Show, where Jarrett said, “…\n\nMSNBC chief political analyst Chuck Todd twisted himself into a pretzel on Wednesday’s Jose Diaz-Balart Reports as he recapped former First Lady Michelle Obama’s Tuesday address to the Democratic National Convention. Todd argued that every four years, Obama reminds the country “she's probably the best nonpolitical speaker in the country.” That those reminders always line up with the political…\n\nThe Daily Show’s temp host of the night, Desi Lydic, sought Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood’s help on Tuesday’s show from Chicago and night two of the Democratic National Convention as she tried to make sense of GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s supposed “anti-woman rhetoric.”\n\nLydic put the ball on the tee for Underwood, “Speaking of extremists, JD Vance and others have been…\n\nWell...it looks like Kamala Harris achieved nothing by replacing her Jewish VP pick.\n\nSwapping in a Commie who spent taxpayer dollars on a Hitler-loving terrorist group just wasn’t enough to appease the He/She’s for Hamas. They still feel underappreciated by the Democrat Party. That’s why they sent 40,000 gender-confused jihadis to “shut down” the DNC all week.\n\nRelated: Anti-…\n\nABC’s Good Morning America has always been a team player for the left, so that meant on Wednesday they had to have on-air Obamagasams to get their points across about how Barack and Michelle Obama were an “electrifying” and “forceful one-two punch” with “political and personal” speeches “pummeling Donald Trump in blistering terms..as dangerous, divisive, and petty” on a night that felt “…\n\nLeftist media outlets like National Public Radio may not have forgotten entirely about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but it doesn’t enter their brains when “Republicans for Harris” compare Trump to an enemy in mortal combat. In this case, it’s Pelosi-Picked Panelist Adam Kinzinger.\n\nIn a “Republicans for Harris” booster story on Tuesday’s Morning Edition, NPR reporter Ben…\n\nIt’s a challenging task but we here at NewsBusters are going to try to sift through all the crazy, angry and ridiculous observations made by leftist journalists every night of the Democratic National Convention coverage and pick one for Worst of the Night.\n\nSo without further ado, the Worst Media Outburst for Tuesday night goes to MSNBC anchor Alex Wagner for excitedly proclaiming the…\n\nAlthough he appears as the ostensible voice from the right on the PBS News Hour’s Friday evening political discussion, New York Times columnist David Brooks is no one’s idea of a hard-core conservative. He said “I love Joe Biden” before criticizing Biden’s angry speech on Night One of the Democratic National Convention, after previously stating “I do think Donald Trump is actually a threat to…\n\nCBS’s Stephen Colbert’s interview with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was derailed late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning on night two of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago by anti-Israel hecklers. The Late Show host struggled as he sought to control the unruly behavior, but also tried to appease them by noting Pelosi’s answers were “unsatisfying to some people” as he did not…\n\nWith hordes of anti-Israel protesters descending on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week, attention has turned to the jurisdiction’s top prosecutor, a Soros-funded extremist.\n\nCook County District Attorney (DA) Kim Foxx is one of the most prolific of the 126 Soros prosecutors MRC documented in its August 12 Special Report. Foxx has built a career protecting the left’s…\n\nAs we indicated earlier, the unofficial theme of Night 2 of the 2024 Democratic National Convention was the transfer of the mantle of Hope and Change on to Kamala Harris, with the Obamas personally conducting the transfer. Night 2’s subtheme is the manner in which the Regime Media fell over themselves in pining for that Obama Restoration.\n\nConsider ABC’s Mary Bruce, for example. Known…\n\nThe erasure of Joe Biden from the national political scene continues apace. Day 2 of the 2024 Democratic National Convention will be remembered for the Regime Media’s collective pining for their favorite president. Case in point, CNN’s John King.\n\nConsider this embarrassing reaction to Barack Obama’s speech (click “expand” for transcript):\n\nCNN's John King, pining for an Obama…\n\nThe broadcast networks of ABC, CBS, and NBC wear vibing during Night Two of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, letting themselves be swept up in the “ecstasy” of the “dance party” that occurred during the fake roll call vote to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris. They let their façade of objectivity slip as they lost themselves in the nirvana of being surrounded by people who…\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is in full swing and, unfortunately, so is the Regime Media. The Regime sycophants at MSNBC, consumed by their collective desire to imprint the Harris candidacy into the American psyche, have now proclaimed Harris to be “the future”.\n\nWith Joe Biden vanishing in the rear-view mirror, the “Hope and Change” nostalgia has been ramped up to 20. Watch as…\n\nDownplaying the backroom deals that had Democratic Party delegates pledge themselves to Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee long before the Democratic Nation Convention’s Night Two proceedings, CNN anchors Jake Tapper (a former party operative turned “journalist”), Dana Bash, and Abby Phillip cheered on the fake and theatrical roll call vote that took place in prime time Tuesday night…"
