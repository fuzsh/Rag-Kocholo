        "text": "February 14, 2006\n\nHello, everyone - my name is Pamela Melusky (formerly Pamela Glasner) and I grew up in Laurelton. My address was 138-25-234th St. My house backed up to the Belt Parkway - in fact, there was an exit off the Parkway right behind my house. The turn was so sharp that if you took it too fast, you ran the risk of ending up in my backyard. I remember laying in bed on school mornings, waiting to hear the screech of tires as some careless driver struggled to maintain control of his car. I got so used to hearing that sound that I actually considered it bad luck if the day did not start out that way.\n\nSpeaking of noise, we were not too far from Kennedy Airport, and we were in the path of a runway. The planes were so low by the time they passed over our block that we’d have to routinely pause in our conversations and wait for the plane to pass - or the person you were speaking with would not be able to hear you. Sundays were especially tough, as flights would come in every two minutes. Anyone who lived in line with the airport knew not to show your house on Sundays if you were trying to sell it!\n\nDirectly behind my house was Laurelton Parkway, the service road for the Belt. Then there was an area we called “The Greens”, where we played for hours every day during the summer, and where the best sledding was in the winter. Right next to that was “Twin Ponds”, where we all learned to ice skate and where, occasionally, someone would fall thru the thin ice at the pond's edge near the bridge.\n\nCross the bridge into Rosedale, where (when I got older) I caught the bus for JHS 59 and later Springfield Gardens HS, and we’d pass St. Claire’s Church and Catholic school and, of course, Manny’s - the Candy Store where we’d buy Bazooka gum for a penny, or baseball cards with a slice of rock-hard nasty gum inside, or pink-colored ball for punch-ball - I personally liked the Pensy-Pinky (if I’m spelling it correctly); my brother liked the Spaulding. And, of course, we’d buy our Archie comics. And - last but never least - Egg Creams!\n\nI remember we had phone numbers that started with names - like Laurelton 7-7942 (mine) and Fieldstone 1-3413 (my friend Nancy’s). And our zip codes were 5 digits long, but we only needed the last 2 digits to mail something. We had a milk box next to the side door in the alleyway - a white-uniformed man would deliver the milk in glass bottles with paper caps on them, early in the mornings.\n\nAs soon as school was out, my friends and I would play outside all day long - we’d be gone from early morning until dinner time - and my mom never worried where I was or if some crazy person might abduct me. In fact, all the mothers would throw the kids out! It would never have occurred to any of us to spend a day in front of a TV unless we were sick in bed.\n\nSometimes we’d walk to Green Acres and shop; sometimes we’d just hang out at Twin Ponds; sometimes we’d take a bus into Jamaica and just walk around; sometimes we’d take a different bus and go to Rockaway Beach. My Great Uncle Jack had a house on Beach 33rd Street. We’d leave our stuff there and walk to the beach, spend the entire day there and come home in time for supper.\n\nWe used to get ahold of some lumber and 4 wheels and make a “Go-Kart”, a simple contraption shaped like the letter “I”. I was always the person in the rear providing the power to move us forward (we all called it “Pammy Power”) and the breaks to stop us. I guess I must gone through a lot of shoes . . .\n\nThen at night we’d sit on the stoop (usually mine or Diane Ritter's) and listen to the Beatles on our record players, or catch lightning bugs, or just sit and talk about the latest clothing styles to come across from England (remember Twiggy?).\n\nAt 11 years old my friends and I went, unescorted by adults, to the World’s Fair in Flushing. Just three 11-year-old girls. Our parents gave us spending money for the day, directions as to which busses to take, and sent us on our way. I can’t imagine doing that now, if I had a child of that age . . .\n\nMy best friends on the block were Nancy Amsel (across the street from me), Diane Ritter (next door), Ellen Keltz (down the street, at the corner) and Susan Muchnick (across the street). Brad Packer also lived across the street, and Billy Bird lived on the corner, across from Ellen Keltz. I lived there from 1955 (my parents bought the house just before my 2nd birthday) until 1971 when I graduated from high school.\n\nI graduated from PS 156 in 1965, JHS 59 in 1967 and SHGS in 1971. I was accepted at City College, but never went, because my parents brought me to CT. Actually, moving to CT was more like an Exodus: first the Rabbi moved, then the Glicks, then the Glasners.\n\nI have friends now, but have never, since I left there, had the kind of friends, or felt that same assumed welcome - that knowledge that you are welcome to just walk into someone’s house, sleep over, have a meal, ask permission of a parent not yours and know that that permission is as good as you own parent’s, because they’re like an extended family . . . . and I still, at 52, miss that.\n\nWhen I was about 12, I had a very vivid, frightening dream that has always stuck with me. In the dream, I had stayed away from my block for a long time and when I finally returned - still a little girl - you know how dreams are - no-one recognized me and (the very strange thing) all of the houses looked small, as though they had shrunk. It was one of those dreams that stays with you for years, for whatever reason. After my family moved out of Laurelton in 1971, it was years before I went back. But go back I did, fourteen years later, with some friends from Connecticut. And my dream came crashing back into my head. Only now it was real. No-one knew who I was - every house on the block had changed hands - and all the houses looked tiny to me! Maybe it was simply perspective - when you’re small, everything looks big, I guess. It was the most powerful case of Déjà vu!\n\nSometimes I wonder how my life would have turned out if my parents had not moved me to New England. Sometimes I think I might have been happier. Not that I’m not happy now - I have a wonderful husband; my son is the finest human being who was born in the year 1977; I love what I am doing for a living; I have the proverbial house in the country with a cat and two dogs and a two-car garage. I just think that, perhaps, a transplant of that sort, into such a dramatically different world, particularly when one has no say in the matter, is a trauma that always leaves one wondering . . . .\n\nWell, I did not mean to sound maudlin. After all, life is what you make it - and mine is fine, indeed. I think I would like a reunion - a Laurelton reunion. Perhaps we could have it somewhere near the old neighborhood, then have a bus take us through the neighborhood, block by block.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who remembers me or any of what I have mentioned above.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPamela (Glasner) Melusky Email Address: landbaron@cox.net\n\nFebruary 11, 2006\n\nThe Life of Riley could apply to Old Laurelton. We didn't have air conditioning but it really wasn't that bad. We didn't have money but who cared? (maybe our parents did). We played ball in the hot sun for hours, probably ruining our skin. What, me worry? We worked menial part-time jobs and attended college because we were told we had to, often resulting in living in a rut, but music was a great escape (do kids have that escape nowadays?).\n\nThose were the old days, but we liked it. We found crazy things to occupy our time, like sledding down towards the freeway near the bridges, running across the same freeways, throwing eggs down at the cars (getting caught and threatened by a motorcycle cop to put me on the bike and bring me to jail-yeah, right), exploring the tunnels in between the freeways and Brookville Park, almost suffocating to death in 1967 when some kids set the picnic benches in there on fire, and lying to our folks about the smell, saying we rolled in burnt leaves). Running around the streets of Laurelton at night talking on walkie-talkies and nearly getting mugged, living on the handball courts near So.Conduit Ave and Laurelton Parkway. Putting pennies on the railroad track, cheating death or injury on the third rail. If our parents only knew....but I'm sure your kids are thinking the same thing about you nowadays!\n\nJeffrey Lyons said that 1963 was the last summer of innocence. So true. Life changed after Lee Harvey decided to make a name for himself. Guns were no longer available for purchase through magazines. People were skeptical of government. Viet Nam fed cynicism. The world seemed to be in chaos. Right now I'm into doo-wop, have been for 6 years. It's the music that started it all and was there before The Beatles. It's a peaceful change from the rock and roll I've collected for 25 years. It's so innocent. It reminds me of Laurelton, where I lived from 1962-1975. We had a few celebs living there as well. I heard that Paul Simon bought his mom a home on 225th st. Orlando Cepeda, Sam DeLuca, Dick Tiger, and though it was Rosedale I'm including Ron Turcotte, lived there. A little north in Cambria Heights could be found the Shangra-Las, leading the pack. Kareem shopped at the supermarket where I worked, as did his 6' 2\" mom. So did a famous jockey. No one mentioned the 1964 visit to the Laurelton Jewish Center by Robert Kennedy. I grabbed his arm and he looked a little disturbed, but he was nice about it. Gary Pattick took the yamulke from Kennedy's head. I often wonder if he still has it. Kennedy stood on the moving car. It was cool.\n\nWe had fun back then. The good years for me were from 1962-1972. The changes brought in gangs, and muggings. Stanley was allegedly murdered in his store, the suspect someone I played ball with! My brother got mugged, my co-worker got mugged where my brother got mugged, and I developed really good side-vision due to walking home from work at midnight. There were tragedies in the 1960's there. Every town has them. Harry Bernstein, who went with the beautiful Wendy Fox, was murdered in Hollis. Michael Trewitt's family had a double tragedy. Tommy DeOrta(sp?) was shot on 232nd st. and Mentone, a bullet hole in the stucco of a house for years. The gang was called The Aristocrats, hardly scary by today's standards, but it had some trouble-makers. The real gangs would later use weapons, not fists.\n\nBut there are so many fond memories and old friends. That's where i read my favorite book, Huckleberry Finn, and would explore Twin Ponds' caves and the wild areas near Laurelton Parkway and use the tree swing there near the park. Al Fintz has done a fantastic job in getting people together on the web. Al, my brother and I do recall when you fell into Spencer Weiss's pool over 40 years ago. It was like a small town, like Mayberry. Neighbors were friendly with each other. Porches were in the front, not the back.\n\nLet me rattle off a few names-Steve Barrett, Brendan Russell and his little brother Shaun Shaun the Leprechaun, all the Trewitt boys, Henry Rodriguez, Gary Saltzman, Andy Calavetta, Michael Sher(Mike, forgive Andy and I for throwing your mom's baking soda cookies across the street-they tasted like baking soda!), Robert Stegmann, Paul Bedrey, Ronnie Kerschenbaum and brother Charlie, Robert Freiberg, Robert Gottlieb, David Kahn, Mark Goret, Scott Rotter, Hal Smollar, Eric and Darrell Taylor, Debbie and Gail and brother McGrath, Pete Calcarra, Al Lapoff, Phil Shadakofsky and Shelly K. too, Dan Kramer, David Berkowitz, Robert Hirsch and his cute little sister Jody, Mike Spano, the Mosteller girls, Mark and Barb Rosenthal, Jay Pincus, Jon Lakritz, Arlene Gottesfeld, and the Jerkins boys-I didn't know your dad trained world famous race-horses! Gino Taliercio, and my newly adopted brother Mike Taliercio!\n\nWell I could write for hours. My name is Glen Gorsetman and I graduated from PS156 in 1964, JHS 59 in 1966, and SGHS in Jan. 1970. Hey, Marie Nelson- I had a crush on you! Debbie Kagan too. Ellen Shapiro - va va voom! But it was just my imagination, running away with me...Go to Classmates.com people to see the names of old classmates. My brother Kurt, who sings great like Tom Jones, lived on Mentone Ave. We looked Italian but aren't. This is a fun website.\n\nThanks Skip, and all you Laureltonians for making it happen.\n\nFebruary 11, 2006\n\nHi, my name is Steve Schwartz and also stumbled on this website while \"googeling\". I grew up in Laurelton from 1955-1968. I lived on 234 st. and 130 ave. I attended PS176, JHS59, and Jackson. Many of the names from this \"side of the tracks \"are all familiar and a real blast to see from the past. Graduated from Jackson in 70 and still keep in touch with old friends-Andy Sheffrin, Steve Kapit.Many of the names mentioned in other postings bring back plenty of memories. Names like Postman, Kramer, Zidbeck, Rubin were all guys we played basketball with at the PS176 yard.Teachers such as Mrs. Sladon, Mrs.Simonetti, who used to put you on her lap and spank you for your birthday (couldn't get away with that today), Mr.Kariss, Mr Solsberg and Miss Hermer, who would sew up your pockets if you kept your hands in them, all bring back memories.\n\nWe had some great stickball games behind PS176 in an area known as Box Canyon. I remember Eddie Geier going down into one of those below ground pits to retrieve the pensy pinkies and threatening to leave him down there.\n\nSome other stores on Merrick Road not previously talked about, but deserving of honorable mention were Manny and Zelda's candy store ,which made the best egg creams in Laurelton. Also Pizza La Tosca ,where in 1965, you could get a slice and a coke for 25 cents. Social Barber Shop was a landmark as well where during the same era, one got a crew cut for 75cents and u tipped the barber 25 cents. (if you were sharp way back when, you tried to wait for the owner to give you the haircut, thus saving the 25 cent tip for pizza and soda at the above pizza establishment. Last but not least, Chicken Delight was a great place to get off the Q-5 bus after school to get a bag of french fries for 25 cents. (the grease was included in the price.)\n\nLastly, other names of schoolmates, from this era who may not have made the Laurelton reunion in 1999: Sheryl Postman, Robin Serota, Joan Sklersky, Ann Bauman, Elaine Reicher, Jill Glassman, Helen Lashnick, Marc Lessinger, Alan Honigman, etc. If anyone out there knowsthe whereabouts of some of these folks, please contact.\n\nSteve Schwartz Email Address: SSchwartz8@aol.com\n\nFebruary 7, 2006\n\nHi again everyone,\n\nThanks to this WEB page I had the most wonderful experience yesterday. A dear friend of my parents, Anita Turk, found me on this site awhile back and yesterday hosted a luncheon with many of my parents other friends (It's been between 25-40 years since I saw them). She contacted me and I was invited to join them, what a wonderful day full of precious memories. In attendance was Marilyn Levy, BettyLee Spear, Florence Lichtman, Florence Kaufman, Ethel and Marty Silverman and hosted by Norman and Anita Turk, who were in Florida just for a few days. Had it not been for this site this never would of happened, thank you so much Skip for providing us with this site.\n\nPaula Wilk Amato, Ft. Lauderdale, Fl\n\nEmail Address: P_Amato@Bellsouth.net\n\nFebruary 3, 2006\n\nHello! I am Michael Storey and I posted back in April of 2005 but since then my e-mail address has changed to mikersto@yahoo.com. I was in Mrs. Nichols 5th grade class at p.s. 156 and classmates were Stuart Smoller, Neil Rothman, Merrill Kramer, Joel Swirling, Vincent Oliveri, Steven Parker, Omar Marti, John Biondililo, and Elaine Kessler. If any of you see this or anyone knows them - e-mail please. Thank you. Mike.\n\nMichael Storey Email Address: mikersto@yahoo.com\n\nJanuary 30, 2006\n\nDear Skip,\n\nI write to you today to tell you about a story that took place several years ago...many actually. On a bright brisk fall day I was heading to Beth David cemetery for the funeral of family member. I was driving down from our home in New Hampshire with my wife Fern and three children and since we were early, I took a detour to \"Laurelton\" to show my familythe \"Hood\".\n\nWell to be sure as my car crept down 139th avenue towards 230th street memories came back one after the other. Looking at those postage stamp size houses brought back many many giant memories.\n\nI can remember the day I fell through the ice at Twin Ponds.\n\nI remembered throwing fire crackers at a passing police car and getting caught....only with the intervention of Captain Al Kirsch (230th street) did I just get a warning.\n\nI remembered lunch recess ps 156 and playing in the \"yard\" and getting the Laurelton Movie colored handbill of the movie the following Saturday...if your color matched....you got in free!\n\nI remember crowding into the hallway in PS 156 to watch the first space shot that took Alan Sheppard into space.\n\nI remember the \"coal\" delivery at 156 every August.\n\nI remember climbing the chain link fence at 156 to get into the inner yard to play ball.\n\nI remember the fights, stickball, softball, handball and football.\n\nI remember playing Chinese handball (ass's up), scully, stoopball (ass's up). It still hurts to think about it!\n\nI remember getting turned down for my first date ...... by the girl's mother!\n\nI remember kissing a girl for the first time.\n\nThe blackout, assassination, HURRICANE DONNA, riding my bike to Far Rockaway, going to Green Acres to bowl a couple of games. My paper route!\n\nGoing to Jamaica to register for the draft! Getting my 1s!\n\nFailing my road test twice (maybe it was an omen).\n\nGetting my drivers license and picking up Kenny Lane at the LIRR station. GETTING into my first accident with Norman Levenson and two girls in my fathers brand new BUICK on the Cross Island Parkway!\n\nGetting off the bus from \"59 and getting a slice or eggroll. Good Pizza in NEW YORK!\n\nLot's of good memories. Laurelton was a family town and although I recognize very few names on this blog, the 38 years since I moved from the \"hood\" didn't seem to move as fast before my visit as it seemed after my visit.\n\nBy the way, as my car approached my old home I slowed to a crawl.... a elderly woman was walking from my old house with a grocery cart. I jumped out of the car in my dark suit and sunglasses in an effort to introduce myself..... my family thought I was nuts as I startled the women. she put up her hands...she thought I was a cop!\n\nI explained to her that I once lived in the house and her response was \"bullXXXX\". I guess I was typecast! What a switch!\n\nNow I live in New Hampshire in the sticks..... lost contact with all my Laurelton roots, hardly knowing any neighbors after being on this street for 20 years. My children never played stickball, scully, Chinese handball or stoopball .......Hollis New Hampshire is no Laurelton. I wonder if Laurelton is still Laurelton? Does anybody know?\n\nRegards,\n\nLeslie Getto\n\n139-22-230th street\n\nIf anybody remembers me or my family please write.\n\nLeslie Getto Email Address: smrarchitectural@msn.com\n\nJanuary 4, 2006\n\nSince finding this site earlier today, I have been unable to concentrate on work. Reading some of the posts have brought back incredible memories of my years in Laurelton. My name is Michael Moskowitz (\"Mosk\" to most back then), and I lived on 228th Street and (I think) 137th Ave.from 1965 to 1971. My family moved (thankfully), to Plainview within weeks of my entering Springfield Gardens HS.\n\nIt is amazing how the memories rush back once someone opens the floodgates. I too lived across the street from Laurelton Jewish Center like Bruce Kessler (I actually think we lived in the same 2-family house with his family on the bottom), one block from PS 156. I moved in during third grade.\n\nMy teacher was Ms. Gyves. Our entire class went to her wedding. If I recall correctly, it was my first wedding, as well as my first time in a church. Ms. Gyves (I cannot recall if that was her maiden or married name since it changed mid-year), was quite attractive to the 3rd grade boys and we were\n\nall a little disappointed when she got married. Then came the \"IG\" years of 4th and 5th grade where we studied French and the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Since everyone I knew was in \"IG,\" we were in the same class for 3 straight years. PS 156 was a great school, with a great school yard. Almost every day after school we played either basketball, baseball or stickball there or went to each others houses. I remember the back walls furthest away from the school where we chalked in the strike zone for our stickball games. Across the street from the schoolyard lived one of my best friends at the time, David Zuber, who, no doubt, has gone on to do great things. I remember thousands of touch football games in front of David Abrams' house on 229th Street (or was it 227th). My friends may remember many basketball games in front of my house shooting at the basket which was nailed to a tree (very high tech). I also remember how we were never home, stayed out all night (at least till 2 or 3 a.m.) for bar and bat mitzvah's and never had any adult supervision, yet we all survived. My kids never leave the house without an adult and they are going on 11 and 13. It is sad how that part of growing up has changed.\n\nI read a posting by Steven Bruckenthal, who I met at IS 59. He listed the names of many of my closest friends from those early days who I would love to hear from if they see this posting. They are as follows:\n\nDavid Abrams, Eric Alperin, Lori Chozick, Mindy Chozick, J.Scott Chroman, Gary Eisenberg, Susan Feilich, Laura Glass, Andy Krugman, Rhonda Meserole, Wendy Orshan, Michael Rauch, Wendy Spero, David Zuber.\n\nFYI, the only person I have seen since moving in 1971 was Gary Eisenberg.We went to college together for a while and he used to live in Muttontown, near where I now live. As I write this, I remember he lived on Francis Lewis Blvd. and we had our Cub Scout meetings in his house. I remember the Kool-Aid his mom used to serve us.\n\nI live on Long Island and work in New York City. I can be reached at mlm@weltmosk.com\n\nThanks for the memories.\n\nMichael Moskowitz Email Address: mlm@weltmosk.com\n\nJanuary 1, 2006\n\nHi Skip,\n\nThis is Ron Cowen, then called Ronald Cowen, who graduated from P.S. 132 in 1968. First, Happy New Year 2006 to everyone! I've posted to the site once before, and I just wanted to encourage people who went to P.S. 132 to post their memories. After all, not everyone went to P.S. 156. Thanks,\n\nRon Cowen Email Address: rcowen@sciserv.org\n\nJanuary 1, 2006\n\nHi Skip,\n\nWhat great fun it is to reminisce the great days we had growing up in Laurelton. I hope that one of these days someone will plan another reunion like the one we had about 15 years ago in Hewlett.\n\nI and two other old Laurelton guys get together every couple of months for dinner in a nice restaurant in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The three of us are: Bob Berkal, Saul Drubin, Art Kern (me), and occasionally Bob Fidlow. How about some of you old pals - and certainly Gals too - joining us. We would love to see and hear first hand from any or all of you. Anyone who is available please email me and be sure to put LAURELTON on your subject line so I don't delete it as spam. By the way, my wife and I live in Watchung, NJ.\n\nHope to hear from bunches of you, near or far.\n\nArthur Kern Email Address: AKern@ValueAlliance.com\n\nDecember 19, 2005Dear Skip,\n\nHowie Katz looking for an answer or two. I've got two photos of my former street, 227th, 131st Avenue looking North and South, from 1951. That's the year before I left my home at 131-45. I was in my sophomore year at N.Y.U. College of Dentistry, and was married that year to my former wife. I forgot that the streets were \"one way\" and which way Merrick Road was. I know my old house does not show in these photos since it was half way (up or down) from the corner, but it would help the image in the memory bank of my old homestead that meant so much to me growing up there from 1929 on. It was a long time for me to be in our \"center of the universe.\" Those visions still sustain me to this very day.\n\nAs our common shared past are almost universal, the same fondness and love is most comforting in this age of violence and unflinching hate. Where tolerance and being a good neighbor were our watchwords, the contrast is blindingly stark. Would someone post the site for me or contact me at katz4bike@aol.com. I would look upon that as a great kindness. Thanks in advance. Howie. P.S., Have a great holiday and healthy New Year.Howie Katz Email Address: Katz4bike1@aol.com\n\nNovember 30, 2005It was great to read down the website and remember the wonderful years growing up in Laurelton. We lived at 227-08 139th Avenue from 1952 - 1964. And yes, I too remember our phone number: LA8 0909. I've already reconnected with several classmates (PS 156 and JHS 59) and would love to hear from others. I'd be especially interested in memories of LJC, Rabbi Howard Singer and the book he wrote (and we used in class) With Mind and Heart.\n\nGloria Frank Rubin Email Address: shalomrav@snet.net\n\nNovember 22, 2005\n\nToday is Nov. 22, 2005, a day that will be remembered by every American, the day that President John F. Kennedy was killed. It is just like yesterday when we were in PS. 156 and Mr. Kiley announced on the PA system the dreadful news.\n\nIt is hard to believe that 42 years have passed, but I am sure that we can all remember where we were at that moment in time and what we were doing. It is just one of those things that binds us together, like our memories of Laurelton.\n\nTo each of us it was a very special place. We all have our memories of our classmates, teachers, and people who touched our lives and enriched them.\n\nSkip, I thank you for maintaining this website so that we can reminisce, and stop every so often and smile and remember those good old days..love to hear from friends\n\nBarbara Klugsberg Email Address: jsternberg@yahoo.com\n\nAndrew Jackson Class of l973\n\nNovember 19, 2005Hi Skip, I was Gene Flowerman of 139-19 231st street what a place it was. I'm 55 now and living in Escondido Ca. and now called Harry Flowerman. I Remember the old times in Laurelton playing base ball on a street and yelling \"car car\" so we would all get out of the way. And people asking why we let some small kids play and the answer was \"It's his ball\" those were the days. Halloween was fun we could go door to door without our parents worrying. I had a 1930 Ford as my first car in 1966 and got it running in 1967. It was a fun car slow and cold in the winter. I drove it all over the place and moved it to California with me. I been looking for a Paul Levinson from Laurelton who was one of my buddies. any buddy who remembers me email hflowerman@aol.comHarry Flowerman Email Address: hflowerman@aol.com\n\nNovember 7, 2005Found this site by accident and have enjoyed the memories.

He grew up in Cambria Heights...his parents were Italian, and he was one of five children. There was Laura, Joseph, Michael, Julia and Rosemarie. Their last name was Di Vilio. My father was Michael, and his nickname was Mickey. His father built houses...and one of them was on 118-11 219th St. in Cambria Heights. I can remember some of the neighbors...My dad was born in 1939...just to give you an idea of grades and years. Any pictures or memories would be great. My dad has passed and I have very little to remember him by. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDorothea Di Vilio - Senetto Email Address: SenettoGate@aol.com\n\nOctober 24, 2005\n\nI just found the Laurelton site today and while I am waiting for my shutters to be put on, had some free time to \"surf\"! Although I don't remember your name, you have mentioned many people I do remember. I grew up in Laurelton, having moved there from the Bronx in 1938. Our first house was a rental on 226 St. (north side) in an attached row house on the second block in from Merrick Rd. After that when my Dad got on his feet a little more (very bad depression years), we moved to 131-78-229 St, and then to 135-47-228 St. We were diagonally across from PS 156 and the LJC. My parents sold the house the year I married(1952) to the LJC. I used to baby-sit for Rabbi Teplitz' two children. My Dad played cards weekly with Irving Masch who was a pharmacist at Rael Drug store. I am now living in Valencia Isles, Boynton Beach, and got a kick out of hearing from a local transplant. We are now full-timers here. I, too have had a long and interesting life and have such fond memories of Laurelton. I have a younger brother Alan, who also went to PS156. His name was Alan Margolish, and mine was Marcia Margolish. I graduated from PS 156 in 1944, went to FRHS for 2 years and transferred to Forest Hills High school where I graduated in 1948. My mom was very active in Hadassah and Red Cross during those awful war years, and I was married at the LJC in 1952, the first wedding in the \"new\" building. Hope this information is interesting to you. Will also post it on the web site. Best regards,\n\nMarcia Margolish Neiman Email Address: marcianeiman@earthlink.net\n\nOctober 21, 2005\n\nSkip,\n\nI have been checking the Laurelton page and have seen many names that sound so familiar. It may sound odd but I miss Laurelton. It was a special place for a lot of people. A town where everyone new everyone else. You didn’t have to worry if you went to a friends house at night or just took a walk. Life was just simpler then. Wouldn’t it be great to have that back again. We lived in other towns in Long Island and in Fl. And you never get that hometown feeling again. It truly was a special place to grow up. Don’t get me wrong all towns have there special problems but most of it was great. Friends made were lifelong, I still keep in touch with quite a few Cookie Linette Lasker, Toby Steigletz, Sandy Ridner, Howie Linette, Norman Samuels, Sue Weinstein then lost touch, Stuart Hess, Abbott Gerlerta etc. Sometimes you wonder what happened to certain classmates one being Howie Halyard-he had a wonderful voice, or Sam Buchannan, Steven Brooks. If any one would like to get in touch you can e mail.\n\nBarbara Boklan Garfield Email Address: leebarb1204@bellsouth.net\n\nOctober 12, 2005\n\nDear Skip,\n\nThis is such a nice site to check out. I have heard from several people that read my previous letter in August. Keep up the good work. I would love to hear from anyone that graduated from P.S. 132 in 1942 and AJHS in 1947. Mr. Blatt was my English teacher and was still there when my son graduated in 1967. He was then a guidance counselor.\n\nDoes anyone remember Phil Scire who lived on 227 Street North of Merrick Road or Dallas Smith who lived on 227 Street, South of Merrick Road?\n\nElaine Rigsby Email Address: dulane2000@aol.com\n\nOctober 2, 2005\n\nFrom Laureltonite,\n\nTwo friends who grew up here, went to JHS 59, and graduated\n\nAndrew Jackson in 1962, would like to contact these very good friends of theirs. Can anyone email me for their contact info?

We all graduated in June, 1965. Can you please post this message we would like to see what old classmates will get in contact with us.\n\nThanks,\n\nKurt, Mike, Glen\n\nThe Decade Was The 1960's...........The Place Laurelton, Queens. We had great times and we were to young to figure out that town would be home even though most of us moved away. Remember Weekends at The Laurelton Movies......Our First Library Cards at the Queens Public Library Laurelton Branch? Most of us had friends that are like family and the relationships are still going strong all these years later...........\n\nPS 156 - Remember the class trips to Museums, Ferry Rides and The World's Fair? The weekly class punch-ball game! The Friday afternoon free time to make models and listen to records. These things don't happen anymore......But PS 156 made us some great memories. Unfortunately all school pictures are gone a casualty of the move out of Laurelton in 1970's. If anyone has the class pictures from 1965 graduating class, please post them.\n\nBelow is a list of our PS 156 Classmates\n\nLarry Kilman\n\nGloria Black\n\nNancy Amsel\n\nSusan Markman\n\nUrsula Tartaglia\n\nGerald Shapiro\n\nSteven Narby\n\nAnita Ginsberg\n\nAnthony LaTasso\n\nPeter Sauro\n\nChristian Shoenfeld\n\nNorman Silverman\n\nIlyne Fried\n\nJohn Zangler\n\nDan Blumenthal\n\nAnthony Cerulli\n\nDennis Kelly\n\nVinnie Vivo\n\nDan Kramer\n\nHazel Terry\n\nEsther Robles\n\nFlorence Santoro\n\nMartin ?\n\nGary Patick\n\nHoward Brezenoff\n\nFrank Dinardi\n\nJason Smolen\n\nSteve Snyder\n\nMichael Mercurio\n\nMary Green\n\nEugene Rubin\n\nNeil Rauch\n\nSteven Phillips\n\nJanet Prager\n\nDiane DeLuca\n\nIf you are listed above......contact us at laurelton1960@yahoo.com\n\nKurt Gorsetman 232-15 Mentone Ave\n\nMike Taliercio 138-06 233rd Street\n\nGlen Gorsetman 232-15 Mentone Ave\n\nThe addresses above were our old ones in Laurelton they are not current......\n\nAugust 31, 2005Skip:\n\nI was referred to your site by one of my brother's. Reading the postings reminded me of what a \"wonderful life\" we had in our corner of Queens in the 1960's and early 70's. This has caused me to uncover old year books (the IS 59 yearbook was officially \"The Senior Summit\") and other memorabilia.\n\nI am Paul Kleidman from 120-03 225th St Cambria Heights. As with Laurelton, Cambria Heights was a \"small town\" in the big city. Linden Blvd was to us what Merrick was to Laureltonians. The hardware store, was between 225th and 226th, and the super market (I believe a Bohack's) down around 221st. We had several bakery's (the German near the corner of 223rd the best), candy stores (penny candy, spaulding, baseball cards), a pizza place (near 224th St) and a go-cart store (around 228th).\n\nWe had great neighbors who watched out for each other. My cousins - Steve (who has posted to this site) and Ric, who lived several houses away, have been life long friends and inspirations. The Benders...Doug was my first hero....served in the navy and I believe on several missions to recover Apollo space crafts (remember those days) lived next door and were like family. Then there were the Menchise family - Nick is still in touch with my cousin Ric and Dave I believe is in Florida.\n\nThose of us that lived south of Linden Blvd went to PS 176, not a better place to be nurtured. Mr. La Monte was the principle. I can still remember him telling me about JFK's assassination, and chastising me for kissing a fellow second grader in the hall. All the teachers were memorable: 1st - Mrs. Manfre; 2nd - Mrs. Hundley; 3rd - Mrs. Cuscione; 4th - Mrs. Simonetti (thanks for allowing me on the crossing guard in 4th grade); and 5th - Mrs. Clarke.\n\nMy first real friend were there: David Berger, Jay Kates, Adrienne Brown, Mondel Sealey, Leona Cohen (her dad was also my doctor), Amy Litsky, Joy Smilon, Carol Strom, David Leboff, Holly Popfsky, Barbara Bellis, and Barry Koch, to name as many as I can recall (or recalled from looking over a very old autograph book). Some of these were also my first \"loves\", such as they are between first and fifth grade.\n\nIn 1967 I was off to IS 59, and my real relationship with Laurelton. Until then, if you were from Cambria, you generally did not stray past 130th avenue (where the islands were present along Francis Louis Blvd), even on Halloween. Query: Those of you who have raised kids in the past twenty year, would you have allowed your kids to have gone as far and wide as we did, unsupervised, on Halloween? Probable not, which is further evidence of the magic of our time and place in history.\n\nIS 59 was remarkable, not so much for the facilities, some what more so for the teachers, but certainly for the people. Thirty plus years after leaving there, and regrettable losing track of most of my classmates (thanks for being a trooper Billy), looking back through \"The Senior Summit\" there wasn't a classmate from 9 SP-1 that I didn't recall and have some memory of. This group consisted of: John Samuels III (a great artist), Darrell Dove (he took me to my first Nets game in the old arena), William Gazzerro (way to many memories to recall, since he was involved, one way or the other, in most), Steven Leeds, Harold Todd, Gary Thomas, James Menis, Gene Mattos, Jeff Azoulay, Mondell Sealey, Adrienne Brown, Susan DeMarines (amongst many memories, we'll leave it to the time I broke the lock on her fathers new car), Patricia Jamieson, three special friends - Leslie Weitzman, Merri Turk and Judy Kornbluh - each of whom provided invaluable guidance and support, Michele Moore, Sally LaMendola, Eugene and Alexander Godilo-Godlovsky (fellow PS 176ers), Richard Steinbeck, Debra Ilberman, Neil Rapppaport, Henry Simon (hope this finds you well) and Vicki Rader. The other 9 SP classes also had many friends, including transplants from Cambria like Jay, Barry and Leona.\n\nAfter school and on weekends I remember cruising Merrick, J & S Pizza (now in Belrose across from the old bowling alley...stopping there occasionally on the way home from mom's in Franklin Square), the movie theatre, and dances and other functions at the LJC. I also remember sleep-overs with \"raids\" on some of the girls houses accessed by using the shortcut from Cambria to Laurelton thru the cemetery. To protect the innocent I make no mention of which of the girls houses we raided.\n\nAfter IS 59 I went to Jackson, one of the few in those days (1970-1973) to do so. I made many new friends, some of whom I still keep in touch with, some of whom are still best friend...my brothers and cousins, as well as Charlie Cooper, and my brother Carl's best friend Chris Policano. However the days I spent at 59, and after school in Laurelton, were special.\n\nI wax nostalgic for many reasons, not the least of which is, with my youngest daughter (I have three daughters, probable some cruel pay back for my years hanging out in Laurelton) off to high school next week, I realize how lucky we were. For all those of you that find this post, I hope this finds you well and happy, and this brings back just a moment of those days.\n\nWith wonderful memories, Paul Kleidman Email Address: jlkklyde@optonline.net\n\nAugust 31, 2005\n\nSkip,\n\nWhat a pleasure to find this gem of a site. Born, raised and schooled in Cambria Heights, 120-19 225 Street, I graduated PS 176 in 1968. But life did not really start until I went to IS 59 (when we started it still was JHS 59), and I met the residents of Laurelton, that turned into the friends and people that have molded me into the person that I am today.\n\nThroughout my life, people tell me about the friends that they made in high school, or relationships forged in college. When I tell the stories of my adolescence, I tell the tales of Laurelton. Basketball, dancing (grinding) , stick ball, drinking (sorry mom), football at Alley Pond Park, sneaking through windows, (sorry to all the dads who now have daughters).\n\nCambria Heights, had great friends and great relatives. The 5 Bruckenthal/Kleidman BOYS...My brother Eric (Ric), the elder statesman of the clad, was 3 1/2 years my senior. The first in the family to wear the colors (Officer) of the school crossing guards, does it surprise any of us, that he is today the Chief of Police in Suffolk County. And all the boys followed in his foot steps, well as crossing guards and officers at least. Paul, Carl and Larry (Yogi) Kleidman, our three-first cousins, raised 4 houses down, all went through PS 176 and JHS/IS 59. I was right there in the middle of group...Cambria was the world to me...But then came 59!\n\nWas I book smart, or as I insist, were the challenges of 59 more about getting us out alive...7SP2 and 9SP2 came calling...What did I know, I answered...What evolved were best friends, best romances, best experiences....We were black, we were white. We were Jewish, we were Catholics. We were male we were female. We would ride our bikes from Cambria Heights, the three miles to 156 and spend the day until the sun was long past gone in Laurelton. Our parents didn't know where we were, it was a time before cell phones, before concerns of what could happen, we were naive, and we were so very happy. First kisses, first sips, first of many things.\n\nThe summer of 1971, the year that we graduated from IS 59, a great year. A better summer...But what happened. I come home from camp, and it was a changed environment. Where did everyone go??? It was as if, all of my friends had moved away in two months...It was, as we know now, but in 1971 I had no idea, Andrew Jackson, and Springfield Gardens High Schools, were looming, and most of our parents had other ideas. Thus, the WHITE FLIGHT, that ended best times of my life. My Jackson career ended before it started, private school called, and soon we too took flight.\n\nI go back to the old neighborhood, and think about the best times, the best friends, best girl friends. Where are they now...You try to stay in touch, a visit on the weekend, a college weekend, but we all went our separate ways. Other then my family, I have lost you all...Well except Chris Policano, who we've been trying to lose for years! Where are you now, my best friends, my allies, my partners in crime and sport. My true loves! I hope that life has been great to you all, and that my worse fears (you know who you are) did not come true! This will be in alphabetical order, but you know where you really stand on the list! This is even more appropriate that I write to you today. Today, my son, turns 14. He too has just ended his Middle School years, and as he enters high school, I see and I know, that his friends will be with him for life. I am so jealous!\n\nDavid Abrams, Eric Alperin, Lori Chozick, Mindy Chozick, J.Scott Chroman, Gary Eisenberg\n\nPaul Ehrlich, Susan Feilich, Andrea Friedman, Hank Greenberg, Laura Glass, Godfrey Headley\n\nJane Hockman, Jody Kleinman, Andre Kloetz, Andy Krugman, Keith Lyons, Amy Margolis\n\nRhoda Meserole, Michael Moskowitz, Wendy Orshan, Kenny Perlmutter, Michael Rauch\n\nMona Rosenberg, Carolyn Russoff, Elaine Salerno, Wendy Spero, David Zuber\n\nSteven Bruckenthal Email Address: WHARTON13@aol.com or sbruckenthal@ref-point.com\n\nIS 59\n\nClass of 71\n\nAugust 28, 2005Hi Skip:\n\nAlthough he lived in Cambria Heights (not Laurelton), entertainer Chuck McCann attended and graduated Andrew Jackson High School. Many people will remember his childrens' TV show on local NYC television. He was a contemporary of Sonny Fox and Sandy Becker.\n\nOn an national level, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter. And many people will remember him from a commercial in the 1970s. A man opens a medicine cabinet in a bathroom and inside is someone who waves and says \"Hi guy.\" That someone was Chuck McCann.\n\nHe's also done a lot of other stuff. And the reason I bring it up now is that he is among the dozens of comedians featured in the documentary getting the biggest buzz of the summer -- The Aristocrats. It's a movie of lots of comedians telling the same dirty joke. Yes, it sounds stupid but it's hilarious. And included with people like George Carlin, Whoopie Goldberg, Robin Williams, Chris Rock, Phyllis Diller and just about every big name comedian you can think of -- is Chuck McCann.\n\nMalcolm Kushner AJHS - Class of 1970 Email Address: mk@kushnergroup.com\n\nI also went to PS 156 and JHS 59\n\nAugust 25, 2005\n\nWhat a trip down memory lane when I found this website on my email from a son of a friend.. I grew up at 137-40 232nd street and graduated PS 156 in 1957 and JHS 59 in 1960 and AJHS in 1963. I recognize many of the teachers and friends..\n\nPS156 was the best with the best bunch of kids and teachers.. They even let us listen to the World Series on the room intercom and I remember hearing Don Larsen's perfect game in 1955. There was no TV. The best pitchers in town were on the stickball field at the schoolyard with the Pensy Pinkie curving into the chalked box on the wall. Billy Berkowitz was the star player. Punchball was another gerat sport and clearing the inner fence for a HR was a badge of honor\n\nSince I went to Queens College I lived at home until 1967 and throughout my college years I worked as a weekend maitre d' at the House of Chang at Green Acres with Marshall Shapiro, the only 2 Caucasians working there. I am sure many of you ate there on Sundays as the food was great. If anyone knows Marshall's whereabouts (he lived North of Merrick around 226th) or of his cousin Jackie Coopersmith I would appreciate hearing from you. I have moved West but always will think of that great little town where my parents bought a house in 1943 for $3000.\n\nJeffry A. Bernstein Email Address: jab@coblentzlaw.com\n\nAugust 22, 2005\n\nI just recently 'bumped' into this site....and was surprised some people remember me. My name is Neil Rappaport....the one who lived at 133-27 226th street (right next to Tom's Barber Shop) from 1959 to 1973 (when we moved to San Diego). My parents owned Samuel Cleaners on Merrick Blvd (between 226th and 227th streets); I have an older brother, Howard, who attended schools in Laurelton straight through Andrew Jackson High School.\n\nI attended PS 132 and wish I could find my old school pictures to jog my memory (which is poor). Max Gilman was (and still is) most oldest friend; he now lives in Merrick (Nassau county); over 47 years of friendship.....WOW. We lived down the block from the Kanowitz family but close to many families. At PS 132, I had Mrs. Fleck, Middlemiss, Reiff, Perlman, and Semon.....with lots of friends in all the same classes: Beth Brautman (thanks for remembering me), Robin Fader, Todd Herald, Craig Casey.....the absolutely brilliant Mitchell Novick and Richard Angrist (whom I'm sure when straight from elementary school to medical school). I.S. 59 friends combined the above with the PS 156 folks.....and some of those people were Leslie Weitzman, Merri Turk, Billy Gazerro (who didn't mention me, but I do remember lots of the same people he mentioned), Debbie Ilberman, Bernard Kavaler (who tried earlier to contact me).....and Judy Kornbluh (clearly a wonderful person!). I think I was in 6E5...and 7SP1 and 9SP1 (am I right?) Mrs. Krantz's going away present anyone? Regents exams? in Math, French, etc.\n\nI was part of the smaller JCH (as opposed to you LJC folk)....and need to find my Bar Mitzvah pictures to remember exactly who attended; it was 1969 and I'm sure my double-breasted suit with my wild tie will always embarrass me (but that was the fashion then).\n\nA group of us opted to attend Jamaica High School (class of '73) in order to avoid Andrew Jackson High School; catching the Q 5 every morning along with Leslie, Merri, Judy, Debbie (was I the only guy?). (Max had gotten accepted to Stuyvesant HS in the city). Lots of great times as a group, surviving a fairly difficult time in life and the crumbling environment around us; I was mugged several times and my dad was robbed at gunpoint once.\n\nI've driven down Merrick Blvd only once since I moved away in 1973....I try to remember all the stores (eg., Stanleys, the bakeries, bagel bakery near the library, the Chinese Restaurants (which were always packed right after Yom Kippur, hmmmmm), the movies, the pizza places, etc). Thanks for the website b/c it does bring back fond memories.\n\nI'm sure I've not mentioned some people specifically; my apologies....it's been a long time and a great distance for me. Regards to all.\n\nNeil Rappaport Email Address: neilrapp@charter.net\n\nAugust 19, 2005\n\nAugust 10, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nIs anyone else struck by the contrast of the twoentries, side-by-side: Dorothy skipping around the auditorium versus the terrified rider of the Q 43? I think the reason \"we\" have been moved to convey our collective memories here is precisely because our idyllic place has disappeared - vanished - and few have been fortunate enough to replicate the life we had led. As Carol wrote: nobody believes our recollections! But, by logging on to this site, our memories of \"the bliss\" are confirmed by people we don't even know.\n\nSo what do we learn from these stories, and the disparities, and the poignant contrasts? Anyone?\n\nSusan Katz Email Address: susanemilyus@yahoo.com\n\nAugust 8, 2005\n\nI grew up @ 133 - 27 221st in Laurelton. I attended PS 132 and had Mrs. Bernstein,Mrs.Feldman, Mrs. Furman, Mrs. Stein & Mrs. Kerner as teachers. My brother & I were in SP until 6th grade. I was transferred to PS 184 in Whitestone during the whole busing crisis. If I thought I was minority in a predominantly black school. I was one as well in the predominantly white school I was bused to in Whitestone. We were of the very few Asians that lived in the neighborhood.\n\nMrs. Powell was the school librarian at the time. That was my favorite place to be. I tutored 3rd graders when I was in 5th & 6th grade. I remember it seemed strange that there was a synagogue in the neighborhood that was changing quickly. My neighbors were Italian,Irish and German....then Jamaican and so on. They moved away during the late 70's. I had friend's that\n\nattended St. Claires. They were in uniforms while kids in my school touted the exploits of Mohammed Ali & Joe Frazier and wore a lot of double knit fabric. I learned that \"ironed\" hair did not mean that you actually ironed it on an ironing board. A school friend was knifed to death on 221st. for his coat in 1979. My mother was mugged in front of our house as she returned home from work.\n\nMy house was next to a supermarket called Bohack. I thought that to be a funny name back then. It was riddled with graffiti by a local gang known as the Black Spades. There was a candy store around the corner on Merrick Boulevard which later installed bullet proof glass. This was something that the liquor store across the street did as well. Broken glass bottles and bullet proof glass were to become synonymous with Merrick Boulevard. Woolworth's was still around and the old man Stanley shuffled along the wooden floors when I would go to buy a ball or look through the out dated wooden bins. I always bought my notebooks from there before the store was demolished. I'd walk to Green Acres or bike there along Merrick Blvd. We'd be extra careful\n\nnot to linger too long around J&S Pizza, the bowling alley or MacDonalds. There were rumors of people being chased through the neighborhood if they didn't live in Rosedale. We weren't allowed to go the local theater but we were allowed to take the bus or ride to Green Acres. Newberry's,Penny's, Kleins and Gimbels. That's where you got your school clothes.\n\nMy parents bought their house in the late 50's. My mother grew up in the city on the upper west side. I think they were surprised by the radical change that occurred so quickly in the neighborhood. We witnessed a gentrification without realizing it. I once found a syringe and white powder in an eyeglass case in the parking lot of the defunct Bohack;s..it had become an auto parts store. Our neighbor across the street, lived there for a long time before my family, had a son who had come home from Vietnam. He never worked. I used to think he was cool. He had a huge afro and all of his friends would stop by to hang out with him. His back yard was next to an old man's yard by the name of Emil. One day this cool man died of a drug over dose. He was a product of those times.\n\nI was lucky to have my teachers nurture my scholastic and artistic abilities. I went on to a specialized highschool in NYC and graduated from a Pratt Institute with an Art degree. My sister and I witnessed racism on the Q76 & Q77 on a daily basis to and from school. I had to attend Bayside highschool for one day before entering the school I was to attend ( Art & Design ). On the way home before getting on the Q43, the sidewalk had been scribbled with colored chalk, \" The Q43 to Africa \". This was the bus my sister had to take before finally transferring to Jamaica High.\n\nI have not been to Laurelton in a long time.....the part of my life was smack in the middle of race conflicts and hormonal changes.\n\nLisa Resurreccion Email Address: Resurreccionaeon@aol.com\n\nJuly 20, 2005\n\nHi,\n\nI went to PS 156 and then I went to Springfield Gardens JHS 59 and then I moved to Great Neck. I guess I graduated from 156 around 1962 and then I went to 2 year SP graduating from 59 about 1964. I remember being in an SP class with various teachers I remember like Mrs. Seltzer, Mrs. Murain, Mrs. Cohen who collected rocks from all 50 states, Mrs. Greenberg I think also. I took French in JHS so I was in the 2 year SP French group. I remember trick-or-treating for miles around until it became too dark, a house near the pond we ice-skated at with incredible indoor Christmas villages that we could wander into. I remember spelling bees, singing contests, and my crowning moment as Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, skipping around the auditorium.\n\nLoren Wissner Greene Email Address: LWGreene@aol.com\n\nJuly 20, 2005\n\nHiMy maiden name was Deborah Gelfand. I use to live at 121-34 238 St. I went to P.S.176. Who could forget Miss Herman ? She still gives me nightmares. Across the street lived Arlene and her brother Jerry Rouse. I also remember Jojo who was also known as little Jo, Big Jo who played the piano while his mother sung along and the Marcus family.\n\nI'm looking for Susan Jacobs, Francis Einzcig, Arden Sue Traubitz, and Eddie Feinburg. I'd love to hear from any one who knew me then.\n\nDeborah Goren Email Address: debgor2@yahoo.com\n\nJuly 12, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nMy eldest son, Howard Rigsby (Class of 67-AJHS) discovered this website. I grew up in Laurelton at 130-40 228 Street from 1929 to 1948 and graduated from AJHS in January of 1947.\n\nI noticed quite a few references to my younger son, Robert (Whitey) Rigsby. He lives in Pennsylvania and has 7 children and one grandchild. My two girls graduated from SGHS. Nancy lives in North Carolina, Wendy lives near me in Zephyrhills and Howard lives in Woodstock, Illinois.I would love to hear from anyone from my era, especially if they live on the Gulf Coast of Florida. I am in Largo.\n\nI went with Dallas Smith of 137-11 227 Street and have been trying to find out whatever happened to him. We were Puppy Love Sweethearts. He graduated from Rhodes in 1946.\n\nPlease keep in touch.\n\nElaine Rigsby Email Address: DULANE2000@aol.com\n\nJuly 5, 2005\n\nMy Laurelton memories are pretty dim but would hope they'd be refreshed by some of you who might remember the Garson Family on 232 St. My parents were Sascha and Eli. We moved there from Sunnyside in either 1940 or 1941. My brother, Marvin was born there on the Sunday following Pearl Harbor. I remember my first day of school at P.S. 156. One of my friends was Judy Masch. I think her father's name was Irving. I also remember Ian and Jeffrey Mackler, sons of Mildred and Phil Mackler who lived on the other side of Merrick Rd. Also, Charles & Adrienne Bernstein, children of Ruby & Harry. Also, the Nagel sisters -- Barbara, Carol, & Ellen. And, of course, the Schackets.\n\nToday I live in San Diego, CA with my husband Mac who actually lived in Laurelton for a year with his first wife in about 1970, long after I had left Laurelton for many other places. I've got 3 kids & 11 grandchildren. Although we spend most of our time in San Diego, we are at our Delray Beach, FL condo for about 12 weeks every year. Haven't seen Laurelton for at least half a century and wish that our family had stayed there longer. We left soon after The War ended.\n\nWe would love to be in contact with Laureltonians, particularly those who are now in Palm Beach County full time or part time (like we are) and hope that we can all get together for coffee at a Starbucks in Boca or on Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach. Looking forward to hearing from some of you.\n\nSue Garson Persaud Email Address: suegarson@sbcglobal.net\n\nJuly 5, 2005\n\nHi! My name is Scott Plakun. I was born in 1952, and grew up a 128-19 236 Street, next to Shelley Levine, who just turned me on to this site. So I'm also from \"the other side\" of Laurelton. I attended PS 176 (with memorable teachers like Mr Solzberg and Miss Herman), JHS 59 (the teacher I remember best from there was Mrs. Shula Hirsch: I don't remember whether she taught English or Math or Social Studies, I do remember she had published a book about the time she lived in Israel) and Andrew Jackson High School (Mr and Mrs Wolfson, Mr. La Rocca, Mrs. Leidner, Mr. Amatrudo, and who can forget SING! with Mrs Lifshey and Mrs Reich)\n\nMy circle of friends included Shelley, Caryn Katz (now living in Toronto), Debbie Cohen (last I heard, she was in the Chicago area), Malcolm Kushner (now in Santa Cruz), Steve Nelson (New Orleans), and a bunch of people I've completely lost touch with: Toni Bartelucci, Stephen Goods, Paul Tucker, Dennis Perman, Elliot Schwartz...\n\nOne of my fondest food memories of Laurelton is the Wong's Chinese take-out restaurant, which was \"closed Mondays unless holiday falling on Monday\", as I recall. I now live in San Francisco, where there's plenty of great Chinese food, but I really miss Wong's style of some specialties, including shrimp with lobster sauce, subgum pork with almonds, wor shoo opp, and those fabulous huge egg rolls!\n\nScott Plakun Email Address: Splakun@aol.com\n\nJuly 1, 2005\n\nThanks for this website! This is Ron Cowen, (then known as Ronald Cowen) and I lived in Laurelton from birth until 1970, not long after my parents split up. I left Laurelton pretty abruptly when that happened and didn't stay in touch with people, but I'm very interested in making contact with friends from that era.\n\nMy address was 226-41 129th Ave (our backyard faced Montiefore Cemetery) and my phone was LA5-4300. I was pretty quiet and studious most of the time, so people may not remember me. My sister, four years older, is Elaine, and she went to Andrew Jackson High School. I went to P.S. 132 and I too recall Miss Rand at the library and her stories. I believe the dog at Stanley's was named Bowser, but I'm not sure.\n\nHere's names of kids I went to school with at P.S. 132: Beryl Leonard, Bruce Mogul (or Mogle ?) Robin Ugelow, Keith Rosen, Susan Weiss, Albert Grant (he had a younger brother, Phillip, and Albert was a great cartoonist), Gary Rosenblatt (I seem to recall we visited his house on a school trip because his dad had an elaborate model railroad set up in the basement), Barry Rubin (only in JHS 59, though, I think), Robert Schless (not sure of spelling), Shelly Kastin, a Phyllis and a Rubin but don't recall their last names.\n\nI had Mrs. Bernstein in kindergarten, Mrs. Rosenberg in the first grade, Mrs. Furman in the second, Mrs. Schiller in the third, then Mrs. Pollack/Mrs. Brown in the fourth-fifth. Mrs. Pollack was very beautiful and kind and she left in mid fourth-grade, around 1967, to have a baby. I recall Mrs. Brown and her love of Greek mythology, and when she brought in her Beagle, along with her daughter. Mrs. Merritt was the principle. We had French, which I loved, with Mme. Rubin. I graduated P.S. 132 in 1968.\n\nI recall playing handball--\"Chinese\" against the sidewall of Woolworth's. Taking the Q5 to Green Acres Shopping Center--I remember at Green Acres leaving two ketchupy pennies as a tip at Newberry's and the pet department there, Karr's (or Carr's) bookshop, the maternity store where my 12-year-old friends and I would try to push each other into the shop.\n\nAt J.H. 59 I was in the \"S.P.\" class. I remember Andrew Phillips, Barry Rubin, Lori and Mindy Chozick, David Zuber (only knew Andrew and Barry well; others just knew as classmates).\n\nSome of my sister's friends were Joanne Miltz, Joanne Hoffman, Jody Agalore (sp?)\n\nIn my mind, I can still taste the Charlotte Russe's at Schary's bakery, see the freezer in that store with Louis Sherry ice-cream, and (I think) marble-chiffon cake.\n\nRon Cowen Email Address: rcowen@sciserv.org\n\nJuly 1, 2005\n\nI was scrolling through the Laurelton messages, and I was so surprised to see my own face! Thanks to Ken Gross - that's me in the front row with the strand of hair in my face. Debi Maller! My sister has posted on here and I thought I would as well. Residing now in New Jersey, I am a High School English teacher in Rahway ( challenging - yes). My son is going off to college in Sept and my daughter is going into High School. Im still in touch with Karen Landy and Irma Sklar, but that's about all from those days. I tried to contact a few people but had little luck.\n\nDo any of you remember if SGHS had a prom in 1970??? I know I did not go to anything like that, but I don't recall there even being one.\n\nThanks for the memories\n\nDebi Maller-Natoli Email Address: debmal52@hotmail.com\n\nJune 30, 2005\n\nFrom birth (1942) until 1954, I lived at 138-19 226th Street. Scrolling through the posts rekindled so many memories...all of them fond. To me, P.S. 156 recalls air raid drills, desks with ink wells, being sent to the principal's office, playing stickball against the schoolyard wall that was posted with \"no ball playing by order of the Boards of Education.\" From reading what others have written, I wasn't the only kid that longed to hit a ball over the fence into the garden.\n\nIt was a different time. No parent made play-dates for their kids. I was told just to be home for\n\ndinner. I walked to P.S. 156 every day and played ball with friends until dinner-time.\n\nMy earliest memory is the snowstorm in 1947. I was 5 years old. The snow was higher than I was. I remember waiting every night for the Bungalow Bar truck to come down 226th Street. And I remember my mother bringing knives outside to be sharpened regularly by a man who had a truck with a grinding wheel inside.\n\nI haven't been back to Laurelton in 50 years. Reading this site brought me back.\n\nEdward Price Email Address: edwardprice83@yahoo.com\n\nJune 23, 2005\n\nThank You Skip,\n\nMark Ponemon here!!! This wonderful website was passed along to me by a friend of mine Barbara Sternberg. Yes I finally checked it out :)\n\nMy run down is so similar to so many of you. PS 156, JHS 59 and SGHS class of 71. It was such a wonderful experience growing up in Laurelton. I too played ball at PS 156. I remember playing until it was too dark to see the ball. Going through sneakers because of the pitching toe rubbing out playing stickball. Climbing into the little schoolyard to play punch-ball. I wasn't much of a fence climber back then but later on because of my training as a youth I could hop the main fence at Tottenville HS on Staten Island in order to play softball with my sons and their friends. (Some kids never grow up).\n\nWho can forget the memorial day parades through the neighborhood and stopping at each house of worship where a memorial wreath would be dedicated. What about Toms barber shop on 226. Everyone it seemed got their haircut there. Being Bar Mitzvah'd at the LJC by Rabbi Singer and of course Cantor Kleinberg who taught you the notes and didn't make a tape for you to follow. Though for Purim he would cut a record because there just wasn't enough time to learn.\n\nI look back and remember the jobs that I had as a teenager; I worked at Purrfect Cleaners, I forgot if it was Real or Dial drugs but it was the store off FLB and 231st. How about Chicken Delight where when I wasn't delivering I was making batter and cleaning the chickens. The liquor store on 231st Street. But the best gig I had was of course was working at Burt and Daves until the day of the fire. Everything in Laurelton seemed to revolve around that little coffee shop. I remember coaching one of the LJC baseball teams and having one of the fathers making calls from the pay phone for me to make sure we had enough kids to field a team. Oh they were fun days and great memories. Of course there is a lot more but rather than bore with more personal stuff any of my childhood friends and or acquaintances don't hesitate to email me!!!!\n\nLove and Knishes To all,\n\nMark Ponemon Email Address: mponemon@si.rr.com\n\nJune 17, 2005\n\n\"The Microcosm and The Elephant in the Room\" Situation\n\nBy Kenneth Gross- P.S. 156, Class of '64\n\nWhile following the resurrected trial of the two white Jewish civil rights workers from Queens who along with their black friend were murdered in Mississippi in 1964, it occurs to me that the Laurelton Gang on this website has not only missed the “Laurelton as U.S. microcosm” concept, but we are posting without going near the elephant in the room.\n\nLaurelton, as we knew it, is a destroyed community due to the effects of racial unrest.\n\nIronically, the photo of my P.S. 156 6th grade class, posted on this website with my April submission, was from 1964, the year the aforementioned KKK murders occurred down south.\n\nWhat an ironic end to the elementary school experience in a place that had taken a lead role in advancing race relations in this country- learning that two whites and a black, not much older than the students you see in that 156 photo, murdered like dogs in our wonderful country over that ignominious initiative- voting rights for blacks. Hey, this wasn’t 600 years ago, it was 1964. A president with leanings towards improving America’s albatross had a few months earlier been assassinated. Now it was time to assassinate a couple of jews and a colored!\n\nSo, it occurs to me, how much better in Laurelton were we than the damn South? We certainly went through the motions of attempting integration. But when I think of the black kids in that P.S 156 class, I see them more as “students studying abroad” rather than integrators. They were in effect visiting white Laurelton at the time. They weren’t buying Pensie Pinkies at Stanley’s, they weren’t shooting over to Four Star for a rye bread, they weren’t popping into Zuckerman’s for a screwdriver.\n\nI do recall when I had my Bar Mitzvah a few months after that 6th grade photo; I went to the LJC with my grandfather real early before services were to begin. There were some invited black kids from 156 there that arrived early sitting outside the temple. The old man couldn’t believe it! They had arrived before the cantor and rabbi! I think it was the young black guest (of co-Bar Mitzvah boy, Burt Feilich) Gilford Fitts, who simply explained to us- “It said services begin at 8:30 on the invitation!” How was he supposed to know that Jewish people interpret that to mean you show up at 10:30 or 11:00?\n\nBut after the attempt to “welcome” blacks into Laurelton, by carefully bussing in some bright kids from St. Albans and Springfield Gardens into the “liberal bastion of New York City freedom”, it was time to take some cues from our Southern fellow citizens and get the heck out of Laurelton by the end of the decade.\n\nGranted the black community in Queens then and always in the U.S. has hardly been a homogeneous group. We’re not talking about the equivalent of Sweden here where everyone is literate, well behaved and loves all white people. Some blacks actually hated white people! Shocking, I know. Well, maybe it was because they live in a country that didn’t show nationwide outrage over the Civil Rights murders of 1964!!!\n\nSo the angry and poorly educated element in the black community spawned the dissolution of white Laurelton. But I think, there was a deeper rift in play. The Laurelton we all remember was Mayberry with a New York accent. It was not really a scenario for a grand social experiment between the races. The black kids at 156 were interlopers, partially perceived as such by the naïve white kids, but more significantly in that regard by Laureltonian parents. You don’t show up at Bar Mitzvahs at 8:30 in the morning.\n\nThere is a comfort zone we all have with the familiar. That Big Laurelton Easy was violated with integration. And the community disintegrated.\n\nKen Gross Email Address: Kgtheme888@aol.com\n\nJune 17, 2005All I can say is WOW! When I discovered this website, very vivid memories came flooding back and I even became a bit teary-eyed. Where to begin??The photos of Laurelton were so familiar. This is Shelley Levine who grew up at 128-15 236 Street (1952-1965). There are addresses where I lived since then that I can't even remember but this one always stuck in my mind. And, as Bruce Kessler (Freiman) so delicately put it, I'm from the \"other side of Merrick.\" Bruce, I don't seem to recall you, but David Kramer and Michael (last name \"Z\") Zidbeck were in my classes at PS 176. If I hadn't already packed my pictures for yet another move, I could scan a classroom shot from one of those years and start naming names.Random Thoughts - In the neighborhood, I wasn't shooting hoops, but I was pretty darn good when it came to any games with the Pensy Pinky or Spalding. I was also good at the see-saw and monkeybars at the school playground. The boys on my block would play stickball in the street but I wasn't allowed to join in. The best times were when we could go out to play after dinner when it was still light out. My favorite Good Humor ice cream was the chocolate cake pop with \"candy bar\" in the middle. I think Bungalow Bar did make one flavor I liked - a black cherry ice cream bar. Maybe I just liked the color purple.Some of the kids who lived on my block and in the same age group were Scott Plakun (recently got back in touch with him), Joan Sklersky, Debbie and Judy Weber. My best friends in the neighborhood were Debbie Cohen and Caryn Katz. And I'm sure there are a lot of names from PS 176 that many of you would recognize. The reason I do know so many people on this site (and who went to PS 156) is that I attended Hebrew School at the LJC. I also went to JHS 59 for 7th grade, but moved in between to Rochdale in Jamaica and switched to JHS 231 for 8th grade. I attended Springfield Gardens High (class of 1970), but if I hadn't moved would have been at Andrew Jackson and know people who went there.LJC memories - Rabbi Singer playing basketball and \"mock\" collapsing from exhaustion; the principal, Mr. Gorodetzer, who bought me a bag of chestnuts from a vendor on a field trip into Manhattan (can't remember where we were going); my bat mitzvah lessons with Rabbi Kleinberg whose daughter I vaguely remember had the nickname Bobbin; Rabbi Thomson, one of my favorite teachers who used to have us compete in games while in the process of learning; and a classroom including Mark Carlin, Glenn Goldenberg, Steven Weinberger, Larry Weiss, and so many others. And Alan Fintz (who apparently is calling himself Al), I seem to recall a scavenger hunt (maybe it was for some holiday) where we were on the same team and had to stop at everyone's house to pick up something from the list. And Oscar Reicher (his sister Elane was in my classes at PS 176), gave me 10 baseball cards and taught me how to\"flip\" them. Said I could pay him back in cards when I won. So I played on the bus to Hebrew School and beat all the boys. Paid Oscar back in full with cards to spare. Remember having cards for Bobby Richardson and \"Moose\" Skowron - I liked their blue eyes.SGHS memories - Mr. Linker's math class, Mr. Chinitz's math class, Mr. Katz's English class (the best!), Mrs. Teplitz's French class (always knew we were getting a test when she wore her black dress and \"dagger\" necklace), Mr. Dunetz's social studies class, the Senior play, theYearbook staff, and on and on and on.... I still have the yearbook and some of its pictures can been seen on the Classmates website in a \"photo album\" that James Robinson put together. My best friend during these years was Diane Krasinski. I'm still trying to track her downand it was during one of those searches that I came across the Laurelton website because Al Fintz had mentioned her.By the way, Mr. Fintz, several years ago you approached me on the train, either on our way to work or home, and I was flattered that you recognized me. Maybe I am aging gracefully. After talking for awhile, you said that I seemed to have more confidence than the girl you remembered. Yes, I was a shy, introverted girl growing up...I was Shelley belly, four-eyes, metal mouth. Well, you get the picture. I sure can laugh about it now.I've rambled and babbled and could say so much more. I hope some of you recognize something I've said and maybe someone recognizes me, because I remember so many of you. Thanks for the memories!!!Laurelton -- life was so simple and good then, but we didn't know it until now. Currently, I live in West Palm Beach, Florida.Shelley Levine Email Address: shelleyfish@earthlink.netShelly wrote once again on June 18th to add the following:OK, so my memory is a bit faulty. My post from June 17 is above this one, but I have a correction, and a few more recollections that I just have to get into print. So forgive a few more blasts from the pasts, golden oldies, and all that good stuff, totally random.\n\nFirst, that French teacher with the “daggers” I mentioned was from JHS 59, not SGHS, and her name wasn’t Teplitz (that was another teacher), but I think it was something like Mrs. Hiller. A few other junior high memories include Chinese jump rope in the school yard (remember that girls, with the rubber bands?), and Mr. Arciello, a social studies teacher playing baseball with the guys and running pretty darn fast around those bases, keeping up with the “youngsters.” Gee, I hope I’m remembering this right.\n\nDoes anyone remember Cooky’s restaurant (and excuse me if it’s mentioned somewhere else already and I missed it)? I seem to recall there was one on Merrick (Rd. or Blvd.), not sure, but I did have my Sweet Sixteen at the one in the Green Acres Shopping Center.\n\nI remember my first time walking home alone from the LJC, (living on the “other side” of Merrick) and being so scared of making a wrong turn and getting lost. I was so relieved when I saw a big silver gate/fence at the corner of 236 St. (and 129th Avenue?) where I knew I had to turn to walkthe last block to my house. Would a little kid be allowed to do that today?\n\nAnd in case there are any ladies here who were Girl Scouts in my neighborhood, I remember a couple of years where my basement was the Girl Scout cookies headquarters.\n\nIf anyone from my side of the tracks who attended PS 176 is out there, give a holler. And to all of you I know from Laurelton (either side of Merrick) through Hebrew School, junior high, and/or high school, you’ve brought back great memories! It’s been such fun to write this and I hope it’s hasn’t been to tedious to read my ramblings. It would be great to hear from any of you.\n\nAgain, this is Shelley Levine (currently in West Palm Beach, Florida) shelleyfish@earthlink.net\n\nJune 17, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI’m Etta (Appel) Weinstein –\n\nA friend and co-worker at our Temple told me about this site, Donna Maller Dawson and I thank her, its great fun to read about where I grew up.\n\nI moved to Laurelton in 1943.

My name is Billy Gazerro and I lived at 135-54 Francis Lewis Blvd. After reading some of these entries, they jogged some very old memories of my childhood. Living around the corner from PS 156, I spent the majority of my waking hours in the schoolyard like so many others from that era. Basketball, stickball (pensie pinkies and stickball bats from Stanley's), chalk to draw the strike zone. Lets see: past the pitcher was a single; past the sewer was a double and over the fence or hitting the school was a homerun.\n\nI remember being in the auditorium during lunch and kids playing the piano or singing on stage for everyone's amusement ( beatles songs mostly). I was probably the only gentile to work at the LJC (foreshadowing future events; I am now in the catering business). Most of the kids I knew in 156 ended up in IS 59 with me and then ultimately in Springfield Gardens HS.\n\nSeeing all these stories on this site....oh my god: Hank Greenberg, Bobby Horowitz, Seth Figmen, Jonny Revels, \"Foots\", Robert (Whitey; we gave him that name in IS 59), Rigsby, Todd Herald, two guys from the neighborhood near IS 59, Chino and Buttons ; basketball players, ( I was jealous of all these guys; they were better athletes then me ). The girls: Barbara Bellis, the Chozik sisters, Robin Baruch, Susan DeMarinis, Susan Resnick, Andrea Weiss, Leslie Weitzman, Holly Popofsky (my first crush), Sally LaMendola, Beth Brautman, Lauren Barbakoff, Merri Turk ( the only person I have kept in some contact with), and countless others. Rosedale Lanes, the Laurelton movie theater, Carmines Pizza ( 2 slices and a soda for 60 cents), the Q5 and the Q5a, the Capri beach club, Casual Dept Store., delivering the Long Island Press, the Pizza King in Rosedale, Brookville Park, the baseball field at Laurelton West, riding our bikes to Rochdale Village ( to see my girlfriend Rebecca Lazarus).\n\nI went to more Bar and Bat Mitzvahs then all of my family combined!. Along with Merri, others who I have kept in contact with over the years, Henry Simon, Cary Chevat, Paul Kleidman. Great times, great memories, keep em comin!\n\nBilly Gazerro Email Address: gus100@msn.com\n\nJune 13, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI'm Etta (Appel) Weinstein.

I just finished reading the New Laurelton website which I brought with me to read on a long flight. Great reading which has set off a flood of great memories. Here they are:\n\nI moved from Brooklyn to Laurelton in 1952 with my mother and father, Ray and Jack, my two older sisters, Marilyn and Lenore (in those days known as Lenny), and our Irish Setter Clancy. We lived at 130-51 226th Street. We lived in Laurelton until 1965 when my parents moved to LeFrak City and I went on to law school when I met and married my wife Gloria (Adler). Gloria is also from Laurelton, but I didn't know her there. She's 3 years younger than me and through high school I did not know girls her age. My loss. I knew her brother Paul through Brooklyn Tech. He and I are one of the many Laurelton boys who made the long commute to Tech, although it was fun schmoozing on the train and bus each day. Gloria, Paul and their parents, Fran and Jack, lived on 230th Street and 139th Avenue. The same block as the Bravins, owners of Sharry's.\n\nWhen Gloria and I would get to talking about Laurelton with new friends who did not grow up there, they were so impressed with everything we told them about our town that they dubbed it the \"Center of the Universe\", and it was for a number of wonderful, glorious years.\n\nOn my block were Billy Solomon and his brothers Steve, Ricky and Elliot; Herbert (Hubba) Rosenberg and his brother Harold: Bruce Rose and his sister Mary: Jackie Kuppersmith and his brother Aaron (Aaron had light brown hair, but right in the middle on the top he had dark hair in the form of a question mark); the Goldsteins (4 boys, one was David); Artie Hoffman and his brothers Bernie, Jackie and Bobby; Carol Shafran (we walked Clancy and Topper, the Shafran's dog, a lot together) and her brother Lester and sister Marilyn; Roy Gildersleeve; the Braverman's (boy and a girl, sorry can't remember their names; David Dresner (they had the first MG TD I ever saw); and Irene Greenberg (my first crush).\n\nNearby were Jerry Sobel (brothers Donny and Sidney); Steve Ferris and sister Susan; Susan Becker and brother Jerry; Emily Spiro; Janet Bayer (my second crush); Kenny Fine (our doctor's son); Michael Ginsburg; Alan Zaretsky; Jay (\"Little Abie\") Lebenkoff and his sister Ethel; the twins Donny and Wally Schwartz; and Barry Meyer.\n\nMy cousins Carol and Robin Kravitz lived on 229th street for a number of years.\n\nI went to P.S. 132 from 1952-1956 when shortly after we started the 8th grade we were moved to JHS 59. After the 8th grade at 59 I went to Tech. I can still remember the day while in 59 that we were let out of school to travel on the LIRR to go to Tech to take the entrance exam in the most spectacular auditorium I had ever seen (second largest theater in NYC-Radio City is #1).\n\nWe were members of the JCH on 223rd Street, Rabbi Levinson and Cantor Katz. No one ever did Adon Olom better than Cantor Katz. Tortuous Hebrew school with a teacher by the name of Mr. Neir. We were the first class to learn Hebrew the way it is currently spoken. Before us, including our parents, it was taught with a different pronunciation. In those days there was only one girl in our Hebrew school class. The original JCH was a converted church and when they built the new one it was reconverted to a church and moved to North Conduit and 225th Street.\n\nAll of the stores mentioned in the prior emails plus the beauty salon next to the Itch, \"Mr. Murray's\". It was owned by my friend Barry Meyer's father. When we would go to the Itch Barry would always caution us to behave because otherwise the matrons would tell his father. It had no affect on us and we were frequently the object of flashlight beams and shushes from the matrons. Color coded fliers that the Laurelton Theater would give out at the schools-if you had the right color for that day you got in free. I never got in free. Standing on line at the Itch waiting for the doors to open and playing \"frontsy-backsy\" when your friends showed up. Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop shows before she went on television.\n\nIn 1961 our Laurelton Chapter of AZA winning the AZA city softball championship at Cunningham Park with 2 out in the bottom of the 7th no one on base, and getting consecutive hits from Hubba, Steve Ferris and me. Better still, reading about it the next day in the Long Island Press.\n\nJeanne Frick who was in my classes at 132 and who was the first one to tell me about a \"disk jockey\" she listened to on the radio at night, Alan Freed. Being on the Alan Freed show and watching him sing \"Come On In\" and clap his hands as we walked on stage. After he disappeared (Payola), doing some submarine race watching at Brookfield Park while listening to Murray The K.\n\nMarilyn and Lenore's Far Rockaway High School letter sweaters. Can't remember the boys names. Their crinolines on top of their lamps in their bedroom.\n\nI read in earlier emails of all the games we played with \"Spaldeens\"-here are a few more, box baseball, box handball, Chinese handball, handball, errors, asses up. But my favorite was stickball. Queens style. Not the dinky kind of Manhattan or Brooklyn where you counted sewers. We played in the school yards and against garages, where a 12 year old could throw a fastball, and a 2 foot curve and you could hit the ball 200 feet. Boy how I loved that game. And it only took 2 guys. And two-base, a 226th Street game designed by the aforementioned Roy Gildersleeve when we didn't have enough guys to play four corner baseball with the Spaldeen. Two-base took only 2 guys on a side.\n\nSpeaking of games, all the games mentioned in earlier emails were great. There were two kinds of pitching baseball cards. One, where you flipped it from your side and it landed either face up or down and the other player had to match. The other, which I personally liked better, was flipping them from a distance of about 4 feet to a wall and seeing who could get closest to the wall, or a leaner, or land on top of the other player's card. Sought of early, very early, Vegas. Winner kept the other guys cards. By the way, just like so many of us, my mother threw my baseball card collection out when I was away at college. The other thing that we did was play chess. There were times when there would be several games going at once on stoops in front of our houses on 226th Street.\n\nTom's barber shop. An extraordinary place for a boy. Where else could you read almost every comic book ever written, listen to men talk about sports, women and stuff, get free gum and gook for your hair (all you had to do was bring Tom a bottle to fill up). Tom waived to everyone who walked by. He knew everyone who walked by. He also displayed a blackboard in his front window that showed the weeks' JVC softball league results and the MVP's for the week. The JVC league was run by Jerry Garfinkel. I saw an email from his daughter. Please thank your dad, I loved playing in that league. A double header every Saturday. If you hit it over the fence that was a big deal. A guy wrote an article that appeared in the Sunday Times magazine section about 15 years ago describing Tom's barber shop and Laurelton. Terrific piece and its available on line from the Times.\n\nWalking around town on the Jewish High Holidays. Going from the JCH to the LJC, hanging out outside, visiting friends' homes, but never quite going to services.\n\nTaking a date on the Q5 to Jamaica to go to the Loew's Valencia and sitting in the court yard of a castle with stars and clouds in the sky.\n\nGetting off the E or F train at 169th Street in Jamaica coming home from Tech and if the bus was not there grabbing a slice of pizza at the bus stop-not as good as Carmine's or Tony's. Tony's was owned by Linda Piccolo's dad.\n\nAlternating among Ebbetts Field, the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium-my friends were mostly Dodger fans, but Steve Ferris and Jerry Sobel were Yankees and Giants fans. Going to my first World Series, the 4th game of the 1955 Series, with Steve Ferris. We left Laurelton at 3 AM and took the bus and subway to Ebbetts Field to wait on line for standing room tickets. It was great-Clem Labine gave me a ball during batting practice. Could you ever imagine letting our 12 year olds take the bus and subway alone, never mind at 3 AM. It was great. Not only did we have Laurelton, but we had all of NYC open to us, including museums, movies and those 3 great ball parks with Willie, Mickey and the Duke. How about Giants football games at Yankee Stadium for 50 cents and your G.O. card! and, at the Garden there were double headers with the Ft. Wayne Pistons, Syracuse Nats and of course the Knicks with Harry Gallatin, Dick McGuire, Braun and Ray Felix, the only 7 footer who couldn't play the game.\n\nGoing to Alan Freed's rock and roll shows at the Brooklyn Paramount, now part of LIU. Seeing Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers, Paul Anka, Stan the Man Taylor, and the Little Blond Bomb Shell, Joanne Campbell. I always thought that Freed had a thing for Campbell because she certainly had no talent.\n\nWalking to Green Acres when it first opened any being amazed by the place, not realizing that it was the death knell for the shops in Laurelton.\n\nHouse of Chang-I was in grade school with Betty Chang and her mother taught me to use chop sticks. Went to Tech with Jimmy.\n\nZickerman's-we all remember that store. It was great, barrels of nails, screws and every type of hardware you could imagine. I think my Dad secretly wished he could have a store like that. When I go into hardware stores today, not very often I admit, I long for Zickerman's. I hate buying screws and other hardware items neatly packaged in clear plastic. Ugh! I want to buy stuff by the pound.\n\nStanley's-it's not so much that it was a mess, it's just that he crammed so much in such a little space that only he could find the stuff. I remember buying models at his store, especially CO 2 powered cars that we raced in driveways.\n\nHalloween-tricks were much better than treats, once you stocked up on candy. We used to make chalk socks and pound them on other kids. I did it once to Janet Bayer's new white coat on Halloween and had to pay for the cleaning. Something I always wanted to ask-Janet why did you wear a WHITE coat on Halloween?\n\nGoing to the beach at Far Rockaway. Only way to get there without a car was by subway which took 2 hours or hitching. My friends and I hitched although we were forbidden to do so.\n\n132 school yard games-in addition to all the ball games, there was dodge ball, jump rope (I was OK, but couldn't do double dutch), and marbles (before they paved over the area and put in trailer school rooms).\n\nRiding my bike to 132. Carolina Scaglometio's (sp?) mother would let us park our bikes in her driveway.\n\nEach street had its own candy store on Merrick Rd.: 225th Silvers, with the best penny candy supply in town; 226th Hammerman's (?) and later Joe's, great malteds and egg creams, and 228th Schultz's, Mr. Schultz always told you the same jokes when you went to his store-\"Guess who's in the hospital, doctors.\" \"Guess who's in the army, soldiers.\" \"I called the zoo today, but the lion was busy.\" And of course, there was the candy store between Raabs and the Itch where we stocked up on candy before disappearing in the theater for an entire Saturday. Do you remember how in the summer you had to squint your eyes when you came out of the movies because you had been in the dark so long and it was still daylight when you emerged at 6 PM.\n\nP.S. 132, Mrs. Powell (3rd grade), Mrs. O'Connor (4th grade), Mrs. Katz (5th grade), Mr. Breitner (gym--he always told us that he could buy us a Cadillac for \"nothing\" if only we didn't smoke, a pack a day was 26 cents times 7 was $1.82 week, times 52 weeks per year, you do the math-within X years we'd have enough for the car). Air raid drills under the desk. You had to cover your eyes so that the flash would not hurt you and the back of your neck so that debris would not get you there. Oh yes, you also had to face away from the windows so that shattered glass would not get you in the face. Talk about the age of innocence!\n\nJHS 59, Mrs. Lev for English and Mrs. Kranz for math. Two of the best teachers I ever had!\n\nThe first day at 59 is etched in my brain. All the kids standing around in the school yard excited and trying to figure things out, the kids from 132, 156 (and I think 176) on one side and the kids from points west of Springfield Blvd. on the other side. One thing I learned from that was that I didn't know how to dance at all. Wow, the first dance in the gym on an afternoon after school was an eye opener.\n\nThe roller rink just past Springfield Blvd. before they turned it into a Times Sq. Store-don't know what it is now.\n\nI too remember the Chrysler dealer on Merrick and 224th. For a while they sold Triumphs. They had a powder blue TR3 that I fell in love with. They were nice enough to let me sit in it many times without throwing me out.\n\nHigh school sorority dances. I loved them. Couldn't dance well, but won the door prizes a few times. Went to a bunch with Carolyn Walton. Spent a lot of time with her and at her house.\n\nPlayed ball till it was too dark to see, and even then if one guy stood under one street lamp and the other guy the next street lamp, you could just barely see enough to have a catch. Of course, until your mother called you in.\n\nThe smell of rain in the summer time on the hot streets.\n\nThe small grocery store on the north side of Merrick between 226th and 227th where the owner would use a long pole with a mechanical hand to retrieve boxes of cereal from the top shelves.\n\nI saw a number of names on the website that I recognized:\n\nSteve Goodman, Howie Barlow, Howie Silversmith (I also remember his brother Larry), Tony Kerns (he was a supreme nut job-the only guy I knew in Laurelton how used baseball bats to hit kids rather than balls-true story), Judy Lesk, Gail Wallach, Jeanette Lebov, Steve Haberman (lived on 226th Street for a while-his dad had an English car that had mechanical arm turn signals), Judie Burstein, Judy Zaretsky, Senator Mosberg, Obenzinger, Alvin Lebensfeld, Bobby Eidus, Judy Russock, Richie Ellentuck, Larry Frank, Steve Brooks, Warren Harris-I think he hung out with Lester Shafran, The Count, Foster Lahn, Howie Krassner and Stuie Pector.\n\nDebby Baum-I remember going to a party at her house one summer. Her dad had rigged up some speakers in the driveway. I felt a bit uncomfortable dancing with Debby to \"Tears On My Pillow\" by Little Anthony and the Imperials because she was on the short side and I was on the tall side, but I must have really liked it because I remember it after all these years.\n\nLinda Desimone-her mom taught me how to play solitaire and her dad helped me finish up a sheet metal project for Tech. You could tell how much progress I made with Linda.\n\nDebbie Klur-I learned how to dance while watching Bandstand in her basement.\n\nRae Liebelson-we were in grade school together and she was so smart in science that we were all convinced in the third grade that she would become a rocket scientist. Did it happen?\n\nThe Gorlick sisters-sorry, can't remember which ones I knew.\n\nWell, sorry to bore you all, but as I said, it is a long plane ride and the memories just flowed. I hope this triggered some more memories for each of you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael Feldman Email Address: mfeldman@proskauer.com\n\nJune 9, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nThanks for the opportunity to post a few words.\n\nMy name is Jeffrey Peck. I lived at 130-12 Francis Lewis Boulevard. My telephone number was LA5-7159 (before area codes). Life was simple then. I am much younger than most of you. I went to P.S. 156 and graduated in 1958 - from the 6th grade! Then on to brand new J.H.S. 59 in Springfield Gardens via Q5 bus and then to AJHS in Cambria Heights via two busses. I recall being one of @ 5000 students and 3 shifts - by senior year we were out by 12:30 - a hell of a way to prepare for college. But I've gotten far ahead of myself.....\n\nI was one of the better players ( I was big for my age) in the Laurelton Little League, founded officially @ 1955. I played shortstop on the Robins - one of several bird name teams. Sol Aptman was my first baseball coach. His son Michael, Lenny Bloom, Kenny Englander, Neil Dukorsky, the Cliffords ( Klein and Gelfand) and a few other friends played in the league. I don't recall whether hipkneedoc@aol.com played with us - he may have been too cool for baseball. I recall hitting a few balls over the fence at the old field near where the Cross Island and the Belt Parkway came together. But I was a bust in the Babe Ruth League - the kids were more my size and I couldn't hit the curve ball. I played third base on a rocky and uneven field - I think it was Brookfield Park and - after taking several bad hops to the chin and groin I switched to softball and discovered girls - Lynn Blair, Vicki Kimmel, Zola Feldman (a/k/a Stevens after the parental divorce), and my first true love, Marion Schwartzberg.\n\nI loved growing up in Laurelton and have fond memories of a warm and friendly town whose families, young and old, resembled those in the popular TV shows of a much more decent and innocent time - Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It To Beaver, Donna Reed, etc.\n\nI look forward to reading the notes posted before and after mine.....keep those letters coming!\n\nJeffrey Peck Email Address: Jeffrey.Peck@dbr.com\n\nJune 7, 2005\n\nHi Skip,\n\nThrilled to see this web-site which was sent to me by Barbara Starin Solerno. We moved to 130-41 235th Street in 1947 and left in 1957. Parents were Sol and Freda Haar and siblings were Floyd and Andrea Haar. Friends on the block in those days were Charley Koppelman, Artie Berkowitz, Lyle Fox, Billy Gargen, Other close \"buds\" included Barry and Marty Baum, Jack Gartner. Willy Wilner, Howie Sklar. Most went to P.S. 38 and since AJHS had guns and FRHS had knives in those days (and I could out run a knife), I took the train to Far Rock. Mu sigma was the fraternity. The Valenica (greatest theater ceiling in the industry) or the Alden for a special date The Itch for a cheap date and the hangouts were Lil and Ed's and Raabs. Basketball was in Charley's driveway, LJC was Bar Mitzvah central The part time job was the fat ladies dress shop on Jamaica Avenue. The Chinese Restaurant on Merrick and 225th every Sunday night was written in stone so long as we got home in time to watch Ed Sullivan.. The car was whatever Charley or I could \"borrow\" when the folks were out for the day. My aunt and uncle owned Estelle Peck's on Merrick and my grandfather was the tailor downstairs. That block on Merrick is the only one changed and it is now a Duane Reed. Girls I recall include Eva Seplow, Eve Weiss, Michelle Rodney, Barbara Starin and the inimitable Marion \"the flash\" Flashberg..I still see Barry and Marty Baum, Artie Berkowitz and Charles (now) Koppelman. These are lifetime freindships. I went on to Hofstra, met Mary Ann there, have 3 terrific children, spent 40 years as a national retail store designer in the store fixture industry and just retired. We are in Bayville and would love to hear from anyone I may remember. Steve Haar Email Address: Journee666@aol.com\n\nDecember 22, 2004\n\nHello, Does anyone out there know what happened to Andrew Jackson High School? It is no longer listed as an area High School. Is the building still there?\n\nRichard Freedman Email Address: RichardFreedman@msn.com\n\nHI!!\n\nI'm Pam Raven Lippman--I grew up at 130-42-231st for my whole life until I graduated from Queens in 68 qnd got married. I am a NYC (Retired) school teacher and currently live in Manalapan NJ. I have been back to Laurelton many times while driving to LI. Such a short detour off of the Belt to see where such fun was had. What a wonderful place to grow up in.\n\nHaving attended two reunions in the past few years it was wonderful to see friends from those years. It is fun to compare notes as to who remembers their teachers. Ms. Coslan ( who later became the Librarian at JHS 59) and Mrs. Badey for Kg, Ms. Heller 1 st grade, Mrs. Nobel second, Ms. Schneider 3rd, Mrs. Aberle 4th ( my very favorite), Mrs. Reid for 5th when she was there-- and Mr. Gambino ( also a favorite) for 6th. I remember getting caught in 6th grade passing love notes with Jerry Solomon who I hear is in Calif, and Mr. Gambino making "
