        "text": "Columns compiled by your class correspondents\n\n1940s\n\n1945\n\nMany thanks to Erin Kennedy in the Office of Alumni Affairs for reaching out to our class. And thanks to those who responded and shared your news, past and present, for our classmates to enjoy.\n\nFrom Dorothy Scott Boyle: “I had been thinking I should try to be more helpful to my class column, as there can’t be too many of us left. I’m living in Ringoes, NJ, with my son-in-law, Richard Delello ’76, MS ’77. Cancer took my daughter, Margaret (Boyle) ’77, in 2012. Both graduated Cornell in the late ’70s and sent their son, Matthew ’12, to Cornell; I’m now awaiting the next generation. Last visit was our 50th Reunion when I picked up Maxine Katz Morse in New Hampshire and we drove to Reunion together. I lived year-round in Eastport, ME, for 45 years but grew up in Poughkeepsie. My Cornell husband, second lieutenant Robert Madden’s plane went down August 13, 1945.” Anita Pomeranz Schlossberg writes: “I am currently living in my son’s guest house on Hilton Head Island. I have eight grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. I congratulate all of you for living to this advanced age. Cornell is in the distant past, but I think of my days there, where many lasting friendships were made, as well as beautiful memories. Thank you for the work you do.”\n\nRobert Hirsch, BS ’47, writes: “I received your request for news from the Class of 1945 and have some of possible interest. My education was interrupted by World War II, where I served as a combat pilot in the Army Air Corps in Europe, but I returned after the war. My wife, Ethel, and I married prior to my senior year, on June 29, 1946, and will celebrate our 75th anniversary next month. We had our first child at Cornell and now have 20 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren. We live in Myrtle Beach, SC, where I am a former mayor, and still live together in our home of 51 years. Cornell prepared us well.” George Karp, BA ’47, writes: “I have moved to an assisted and independent facility in Walnut Creek, CA. I have all four of my sons in California, plus four grandchildren and my one great-granddaughter. I spoke to Barney Mayrsohn, BS ’47, and he still loves Cornell and the Class of ’45, as I do.”\n\nFrom Alison Kent Bermant ’70: “I am writing to report the deaths of my Cornellian parents, Donald ’42, MD ’45, and Madelaine Ring Kent, BA ’44. Dad died on February 22, and Mom just 16 days later on March 10, nine days short of what would have been their 75th wedding anniversary. Both were devoted Cornellians. They attended all the Reunions and sent three of their four children to study at Cornell. Mom still cried tears of joy when listening to the Alma Mater. They met during Mom’s freshman year and remained inseparable even in death. While on the Hill, Dad was captain of the fencing team, student council vice president, and a member of Quill and Dagger and Tau Delta Phi. Mom appeared in many theatrical productions and was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. Dad practiced internal medicine and cardiology for 50 years on Long Island and Mom was active in local and national organizations. They traveled the world together and were a wonderful sight to behold on the dance floor. Happily, they both died at home from non-COVID-related causes. They are mourned by numerous Cornell family members including a surviving sister, nieces, nephews, and grandnieces, in addition to their children.”\n\nI, Frances Shloss, am currently spending time at my cottage on Lake Okoboji, IA. Finally, after last year’s hiatus, we are enjoying yacht club races, social hour cocktail parties, art classes, and weekly theater shows. Last night’s Grease was as entertaining as anything you might see on Broadway. Many thanks again for your response for news. Class Notes is, and will continue to be, alive and well. ❖ Frances Shloss, 124-A South Maple Dr., Beverly Hill, CA 90212; tel., (310) 276-3345; email, fmshloss@roadrunner.com.

Our Class of 1946’s 11 classmates in attendance BEARly broke the 75th Reunion all-time record of ten, established by the Class of 1941. When the dancing at the ball stops and we get our feet back on Mother Earth, we’ll write up the glorious details and send them to you in the next column. We repeat from the last column that we would highly recommend that all Cornell Reunions in the future have a virtual choice for those unable to make the Ithacan Odyssey.\n\nTo list your email address in your submissions, email me at the below e-address. Include your name, city, and state. ❖ Paul Levine, 3273 Streamside Cir., #S-202, Pleasanton, CA 94588; tel., (925) 201-7575; email, pblevine93@gmail.com. Class website. Online news form.\n\nWomen\n\nHurrah for Erin Kennedy! She was our much-needed guide throughout the entire Reunion weekend. Without Erin, it would not have happened. Also then, of course, I am most grateful for the men on our committee, Phil Gisser and Steve Marder, and led by Paul Levine, BS ’49. With many questions about my sudden illness popping up, they were ready to take over if necessary. Fortunately, I appeared on Thursday, June 10, and was able to take over. I hope that many of you were able to see the wine tasting event with the Johnson family. This was a very special treat presented by New York State’s oldest and most prestigious winery established in 1961 by Fred Johnson ’43, BS ’46.\n\nI would love to hear some comments from attendees of our virtual Reunion! Send them to: ❖ Dorothy Taylor Prey, 1 Baldwin Ave., #501, San Mateo, CA, 94401; tel., (650) 342-1196; email, dmprey@aol.com. Class website. Online news form.\n\n1947\n\n“I have a granddaughter attending Cornell,” writes proud grandfather Edward Simpson. “My wife passed away four years ago. Luckily, I have good friends and a close companion.” Edward spends winters in Florida, where he enjoys watching the wildlife, playing golf, and planning cruises with his companion. “I’m looking forward to playing bridge in person instead of online.” His biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “Appreciating your friends.”\n\nDonald Van Waes, PhD ’51, is still living at home, spending his time golfing, gardening, and walking his therapy dog, Murphy. Time with family brings him great satisfaction, and he adds, “I welcomed my 15th and 16th great-grandchildren in 2020!” Congratulations!\n\nPlease take a moment to drop us a line and let us know how you and your family are doing. How has the pandemic impacted you? We’d love to keep in touch. ❖ Class of 1947, c/o Alexandra Bond ’12, abb83@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\n1948\n\nBarbara Cole Feiden writes from White Plains, NY, that, like the rest of us, she doesn’t do much beyond reading a lot and seeing more doctors than she likes. In explaining her age of 96, she notes that she spent two years in the Canadian Army. (That alone makes her a bit unique in the Cornell Class of 1948!) Husband Barry ’49 was also a Cornellian but is now deceased. Oh yes, she is taking online courses with Cornell. Phyllis Flyer Kavett, professor emerita at Kean U., spends her time trying to stay healthy and vertical and gets the most satisfaction out of fresh air, sunshine, and a temperate climate. Her biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “How unappreciated life was without it.”\n\nJackie Smith Flournoy reports that her life changed with a recent move to the Broadmead senior living facility, where she is pleased to have her dinner delivered (cutting down on cooking) and got her two COVID vaccinations with great ease. When she is able to “get out” again, she hopes to work at a thrift shop with her daughter who lives in the area with her husband and three children, all of whom she sees frequently. Like many fellow retirees, she gets much satisfaction in getting rid of unnecessary paper and other items. On an upbeat note, she feels a side effect of the pandemic was a kinder attitude among people. James Howell, BS ’50, explains he actually graduated in 1950—having started in 1944, he got in two years, then had two years in the Army, and came back to the Hill for his final two years. Like others in his circumstance, he chose his original Class of 1948 to affiliate with and “reunioned” with the rest of us. Like others, again, he gets the most satisfaction in waking each morning and enjoying another day.\n\nYour correspondent built his home 35 years ago on Hilton Head Island, SC, in what is now a fully developed community spread among the pine trees, oak trees, landscape shrubs, four golf courses, and many lagoons. I greatly enjoyed all that was offered then, but now nearly all of my friends are gone. The restrictions of COVID-19 have refocused my attention on all that Mother Nature has to offer. From my windows and glass sliding doors I can see the three suet feeders and one hummingbird feeder hanging sheltered under my roof overhang, my larger sunflower seed feeder hanging from a tree limb near my bubbling birdbath fountain, and the corncob feeder for squirrels on another nearby tree. I have many birds in permanent residence: cardinals, Carolina wrens, bluebirds, chickadees, house sparrows, tufted titmice, towhees, downy woodpeckers, etc., plus visitation by robins and finches (with the identity of all established by reference to the colorful and complete chart provided me by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in hopes I would become one of their regular reporters, but I found my partial red-green colorblindness made that too difficult).\n\nOne summer, the goldfinches migrating through the area stopped off long enough to completely strip the ripe, red berries from my pyracantha bush in about an hour! And on the ground, a rabbit loves to eat the green grass around my birdbath and stand on its hind legs to eat the flowers and leaves of my confederate jasmine. Occasionally, mother deer drops by to eat the leaves and flowers of my hibiscus and roses—several times accompanied by her two young does. Still remembered for many years, but gone, is mother quail walking across the backyard with four young ones trailing her. Of course, if you want to walk to the nearest lagoon you can watch the anhinga (birds) stand on the edge for hours with their wings outspread to dry their non-greasy, non-waterproof wings before entering the water—or not entering the water, because one of our alligators (six to 12 feet long) is swimming or sunning nearby. This viewing reminds me of the final scientific marvel: that all these plants, birds, and animals have chromosomes made up of just four amino acids (thousands of them in a string) arranged to instruct the living organism how to make an exact duplicate of itself! ❖ Ray Tuttle, 65 Oyster Reef Dr., Hilton Head Island, SC 29926; email, RayTutt@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1949\n\nJean Schultheis Brechter (Shelter Island, NY), whose grandson is graduating from Cornell next year, tells us that she is “looking forward to the hard copy” of the new publication. She wishes to point out that “many of us are old ladies” and perhaps are not comfortable with the new technologies.\n\nAnn Seguin Hill writes from Toms River, NJ, “I just received my final edition of Cornell Alumni Magazine. I feel sad, as I looked forward to each edition of the magazine and the news and photos. I sadly missed the 70th Reunion. I was all set to go, and then I fell and broke a bone in my hip. I now live in a rehab nursing facility and am doing well. My two daughters and two granddaughters take good care of me. I’ll be a great-grandmother for the first time soon, and we are thrilled. COVID-19 has changed our lives. The visiting is different, but rules are changing for the better. A bright spot in my life is that Toni Hallinan Ottobre, my freshman roommate, lives ten minutes from me. We see each other often and talk on the phone. Toni and I can’t believe that we are 94 years old. As I look back on my life, I feel that one of the best parts was my four years at Cornell—the education, friendships, fun, and so much more.”\n\nPlease let us hear from each one of you. Contact your class correspondent: ❖ Dorothy Mulhoffer Solow, winspeck@yahoo.com. Online news form.\n\nBack to the top\n\n1950s\n\n1950\n\nWelcome to the new Class Notes format. At this writing (June 15), we do not know the exact format in which you shall receive this. We have been assured it will be available free online, and by subscription for those who prefer a print version. We are overjoyed to be assured that it will reach all alumni, not the less-than-10% reached by the now-laid-to-rest Cornell Alumni Magazine. We hope this greater coverage shall generate more interest in our class column devoted to news and views of members of the Class of the Century. I’m elated to start my 21st year as your class correspondent. Trust me; your personal news is of interest to your classmates, so keep me informed and up to date.\n\nThere is a distinct pleasure with this correspondent’s job, countered by equal disappointment. Pleasure in learning and writing about our accomplished classmates. Disappointment in knowing so few personally. In past columns I have tried to feature those whom I have been lucky enough to learn about. It’s my hope that with the wider circulation of our column in the new communications hub, I may come to know about more of you and can send what I learn on to our eager classmates.\n\nI was intrigued to learn that Ellen Forbes Andrews (Greenville, SC) came to Cornell at age 16 and asked her to explain. Her reply: “I started Cornell at age 16 with WWII veterans ten years my senior. I think I may be the youngest graduate in our class. I grew up on a farm near Homer, NY, 25 miles northwest of the campus. I had attended a one-room school, where I did six grades in five years (not skipping any) and graduated from high school in a class of 36 in 1946. I lived on campus because my father (Cornell 1922) felt I needed to experience campus life. While pledging Sigma Kappa, my big sister set me up with a law student. Given my age, he said he felt he was being set up with jailbait! It was strange having so many older students, but I was able to date guys closer to my age and thoroughly enjoyed my four years on campus. My friends tease me that I went four years and never saw anything rotten. Right now (May 29), I’m looking forward to a week in June celebrating my 91st birthday at Hilton Head with my whole family, including four great-grandchildren.”\n\nWhile unable to travel to see distant family members during the pandemic, Allan Mitchell (North Rose, NY) happily reports on a fourth generation of 12 great-grandkids. He stays busy with gardening and home maintenance, and reports that his greatest satisfaction comes from public service work with his church and local Lions Club. Elizabeth Ann Alexander Weis (Osprey, FL) reports being blessed to be able to live at home and deal with whatever life offers. She is retired from the practice of law but thanks to phone, email, and Zoom retains an active role as mother. Her greatest satisfaction is the pleasure of being able to read, greet each day, see the seasons change, and maintain loving relationships with friends, neighbors, and her children. Biggest takeaway from the pandemic? Praise for front-line workers but also disappointment at some for their lack of concern for the rights of all. For her it has been a test of the backbone of our country. She has worries about the future but also sees much to be hopeful for.\n\nIn a little box on page six of the May/June issue of CAM it’s reported that next year’s tuition will be $60,286 in the endowed colleges and $40,382 in the statutory colleges. Additional costs will be: room and board, $16,396; activity fee, $309; health fee, $420; books, $1,000; personal, $1,876; plus travel. Total for 2021–22 in the endowed colleges: $81,287. Four-year projection around $330,000!\n\nA compelling question should immediately arise. Is that an expenditure or an investment? If the former, what exactly is being purchased? What will be its enduring value? Compared to alternative expenditures, is it a wise decision? If it’s an investment, will it provide a reasonable return on the principal? Now consider that only a few applicants can write a check for $80,000. Of course, Cornell promises student aid to those who need it. However, some of such aid will be in the form of loans, consequently contributing to the already national out-of-control student debt.\n\nHowever, the most crucial question is the extent to which a Cornell education may be superior to other colleges or universities. My opinion (based on 34 years as a professor in three universities, and experiences with 20 different colleges or universities attended by my five kids, two foster kids, 13 grandkids, and me) is that a Cornell education is not superior to other colleges and universities. However, it may be offset by the Cornell experience, its intrinsic socio/cultural value, and the fact that it opens doors—in my case, definitely the latter. I busted out, got reinstated, and graduated with a C-minus average. After ten years Cornell opened academic doors, and I earned master’s degrees in education and science and a doctorate in science education and biology from Rochester. This led to a wonderfully productive and satisfying life as a university professor. ❖ Paul Joslin, 13731 Hickman Rd., #4207, Urbandale, IA 50323; tel., (515) 278-0960; email, phjoslin@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1951\n\nLet’s begin with my notes from the virtual Cornell Reunion in June. I attended several events, including: “A Cosmic Conversation”; “Class of ’51: Making the Most of Your Later Life”; “Class of ’51: Memories Mixer”; “The Future of Cities”; the Friday night game show “Clash of the Cornellians”; and a variety show called “Spirit of the Hill.”\n\nThe three-day Reunion began with Carl Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, talking about the activities at the Carl Sagan Inst., where they are still looking for extraterrestrial life. Ann and Carl fell in love while planning the space voyage that made him famous. We learned that Carl, who died in 1996, was attracted to Ithaca by the gorges, and that Carl and Ann went to jail for protesting several times. Prof. Corinna Loeckenhoff then talked about how to make the most of your later life. She recommended elasticity and exercise, and left us with a message that aging is not dying. It’s important to explore new things, learn new skills, and keep the brain active.\n\nThe most social event of the virtual Reunion was a panel of 23 classmates from the Class of ’51 commenting on their favorite teacher, discussing their favorite experience from their four years at Cornell, and in general talking about what’s been going on. The most interesting story, I thought, was from an alumnus who, when kept from getting on a plane from Italy to the US, recognized Mario Einaudi and requested his help on getting on the flight, which was provided. Prof. Einaudi taught at Cornell. Kind words were spoken about several other professors from our days at Cornell including David Daiches, Milton Konvitz, PhD ’33, Vladimir Nabokov, another man whose name I can’t remember, and Harold Bloom, a classmate of ours who is a Shakespeare specialist and became a professor at Yale. Classmates also reminisced about the Truman-Dewey election, when Dewey was declared the winner by a New York paper only to discover it was Truman who won.\n\nThe Friday night game show was fun, as I knew several of the answers. It was easy to watch. You got a chance to supply your own answer before the contestants rang in with their answer. Some of the questions were tough. The variety show was very good. I particularly enjoyed the drums, which were impressive. My mother wanted me to take up something musical and I said drums. I saw from the program what I could have been able to do, but my mom got tired of me pounding on drums after a month and I ended up with a flute. I enjoyed the singing the most.\n\nThe class officers for the upcoming term have been determined. Shelley Epstein Akabas agreed to be president; Chuck Mund is vice president; Rip Haley is membership chair; Betty Meng Howell is secretary; I remain class correspondent; the treasurer is Jim Stocker; and Reunion chairs are Rip Haley and Jim Stocker. A lot of money was raised, with over $3 million from our class.\n\nBetty Howell (bettyhowell2017@gmail.com) writes, “Jack and I have given up driving. We are now dependent on apartment transportation.” Regarding activities in retirement, Betty states, “I remain involved with Master Gardeners and garden here at our apartment complex. Jack enjoys having large print books for reading. We try to walk every day, and we Zoom with our children.” Thomas Merrill’s daughter writes, “My dad passed away in December 2020. He was a Chemistry major, graduating in 1951. He went on to work in chemistry for his whole career. He remembered his Cornell days clearly and especially enjoyed living in a co-op house (Cayuga Lodge) while a student.”\n\nJoseph Bertino (bertinoj@cinj.rutgers.edu) writes, “I’m now in a wheelchair. Spinal cord injury. I started a biotech company called Xiconic” (which lists him as chief scientific officer and president). Thomas Borthwick’s wife, Josephine, writes, “Tom died on January 31, 2021 from congestive heart failure.” He retired from a career in investment and moved to Pinehurst, NC, where he took up cabinet woodwork. Elizabeth Robinson von Dohlen (Bloomfield, CT; rjvondohlen@comcast.net) says, “Our life changed when we moved from our house to a retirement community. It was a good move because most of our old friends are no longer with us. At 91 we (Jack ’49, MRP ’54, and I) are just trying to stay alive and kicking.” Elizabeth adds, “We have three daughters, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.” “Staying alive” brings her the most satisfaction, although, she adds, “we regret the loss of freedom.”\n\nCalvin Gage (Lake Bluff, IL; calgage@aol.com) writes, “A major change has been the shrinkage of our travel horizon. Since March 2020, we have lived within a radius of 15 miles from our home. Just short hops for groceries, medical appointments, etc. We put 1,200 miles on the car. No dining out, but found eating in a delight.” Calvin says he has been “aging gracefully” and gets the most satisfaction in life from “keeping in touch with family and friends.” Paul Jones (Atherton, CA) writes, “I am still alive, spending most of my time on Zoom.” Regarding work or retirement, Paul says, “I’m keeping busy with town and church duties and still trying to abort California’s misrouted, mismanaged, and mis-executed high-speed rail project.” He adds, “First great-grandson, age 2, and ongoing friendships” bring him the most satisfaction these days. His biggest takeaway from the pandemic is “patience.” ❖ Brad Bond, email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12, abb83@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\n1952\n\nWell, here we are on the hub. First and foremost, thanks for all those news forms. We have lots to report here, and more for next time. Please note the little box on the news form that allows your e-address to be printed; if you did not mark that box, your email address is not included. Gerald Read (Rochester, NY; swcbread25@gmail.com) writes, “My wife, Shirley, and I moved to an apartment four and a half years ago. We both retired from teaching in Prattsburgh Central School; Shirley taught elementary grades and I taught agriculture. After part-time farming and traveling all 50 states and 24 other countries, we live a quiet life. COVID has kept us confined.” The Reads have 14 grandchildren and 15 greats, all of whom they enjoy when they can. What brings them greatest satisfaction these days? “Communications with family and friends, email, phone, and Facebook.” Their biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “The lack of visiting with family and friends.”\n\nAlison Bliss Graham (Wynnewood, PA) says, “We miss traveling and seeing our ‘Western’ family—also concerts and theater in Philadelphia, where we have lived for 51 years! We will miss Cornell Alumni Magazine but hope Class Notes survive as we approach our 70th Reunion.” Family brings Peter Ward (Candor, NY) the most satisfaction these days, and he lists four children, 11 grandchildren, and ten greats. His biggest takeaway from the pandemic was “government control of our daily lives.” Anthony Bryant (Waukesha, WI) writes, “After returning from 15 days in French Polynesia on March 16, 2020 (just barely made it back), Andrea and I haven’t been able to travel very much. I’m in my office daily, preparing my grandson to assume the presidency of my company (Century Fence Co.) on January 1, 2022. We welcomed two new great-granddaughters into the family during 2020.” What brings Anthony the most satisfaction these days? “Having my company (an essential business) experience its most successful year in its 104-year history.” His takeaway from the pandemic: “You’ve got to stay engaged in the activities you’ve always done, otherwise your life is over!” Irwin and Arline Braverman Broida (Wayne, NJ) say, “Even though we have been told ‘old age is a privilege denied to many,’ we now know too well that it ain’t for sissies. Hello to all our ‘privileged’ ’52 classmates.”\n\nPatricia Stitt Truell (Williamsville, NY) writes, “Like everyone else, my social activities were greatly reduced. Fortunately, I moved two years ago to an apartment in an independent living community, so I see people and have ‘some’ social life.” Eben Lang (Audubon, PA; langsebago3@gmail.com) sends best wishes to all of his classmates and hopes they got through 2020 and COVID with a minimum of stress and frustration. “Mimi and I live in a retirement community, Shannondell at Valley Forge, just northwest of Philadelphia. Because of state restrictions, we have not been able to visit or receive friends as much as we would normally like to. However, our place here is marvelous: fitness center, large swimming pool, card rooms, pharmacy, movie theater programs, wood shop work, and so on. If anyone would like more information, I would be happy to answer any email requests. The biggest event of the year, although not the most enjoyable, was the leak in the roof of our apartment. A heavy snowstorm, which turned into an ice dam, caused multiple water leaks into our guest bedroom. Fortunately, there were no guests because they would have been very wet. However, due to the quick work of our excellent maintenance department, damage was held to a minimum. How’s that for our most exciting experience? One of our most active projects until January 6 has been helping Joe Biden win the presidency. We are very happy with the results of the election. Many of our Republican friends would agree. I do hope that both sides can get together on some mutually agreeable legislation and actually get some things accomplished. Hopefully there will be more like Susan Collins and Mitt Romney.” Most satisfaction? “We are living mainly in our apartment except for supermarket, banking, and hardware store visits. We spend a lot of time reading, and I am in the fitness center as much as possible.” Biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “Never give up.”\n\nJudith Calhoun Schurman (New Canaan, CT) has been “surviving the virus!” She’s got two great-grandchildren and was looking forward to a “big family reunion in Maine in September 2021.” Her greatest satisfaction these days came from “receiving two COVID-19 shots.” Shirley Sagen Norton (Canton, NY; snorton7@twcny.rr.com) writes, “For about a year now, life has been routine here at Partridge Knoll (independent living apartments). We were somewhat quarantined for most of 2020, but it’s better now. No one here got COVID and everyone got vaccinated. All my family are doing well—Bruce ’77, Bonnie ’81, DVM ’84, and Brian.” Biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “Get vaccinated, take care of yourself, and hope others do the same.” I have more news than will fit in this column, so don’t be surprised if material you sent in takes a few months to be published. I like your voices as they come through. Of course, we will make room for 70th Reunion news. ❖ Joan Boffa Gaul, joangaul@mac.com. Class website.

Julian Max Aroesty (jma38@cornell.edu) reports he’s nearing 90 and wintering in Longboat Key, FL. “I’m cycling 100 miles per week (improving cardiovascular fitness and decreasing Alzheimer’s risk) and also still consulting and teaching at the hospital and teaching grandchildren Spanish. COVID has dulled my taste, which is gradually improving.”\n\nFelice Bernstein Burns enjoys taking classes and playing bridge on the computer and feels very fortunate that she hasn’t suffered much during the pandemic. “I remember while living in Comstock, we were looking for a fourth for bridge. One of the male student workers said he’d be fired if he came to the girl’s dorm. Today, that’s a joke! I’m happy to be able to communicate with family and friends and that I’ve been vaccinated!” Henry Charlap has been living in a skilled nursing facility for the past three years. “I remember when I was in school, I won the dairy products judging contest in Springfield, MA. My brothers in Seal & Serpent dubbed me the ‘Best Nose on the Hill.’ My son has taken over my ice cream operation after taking a short course at Cornell.”\n\nDonald Collin ’52, BEE ’53 (ibdrc@aol.com) reports that his wife of 65 years passed away in April. “I have severe neuropathy in both legs and have health aid most of the time, but I keep busy doing investments online—making money that I don’t need and plan to give away. I still belong to two yacht clubs even though I had to get rid of my 65-ft. Viking yacht because I’m no longer able to work on it. I’d like to hear from any old friends who are still alive.” Vince Giarrusso was awarded the Louis J. Conti Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cornell Football Assn. in 2018. The award recognizes former members of Cornell’s football program who have demonstrated a genuine commitment to Big Red football through their support, leadership, and service. A two-year letterman in football and three-year letterman in baseball, Vince played on Cornell’s last AP ranked football team in 1949 (ranked 12th) and on the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League champions team in 1952. After graduation, he became a serial entrepreneur as an early Dairy Queen franchisee, owner of North Shore Shuttle, and owner of Fleetwood Recording Studios.\n\nWe were sorry to hear that Jim Hanchett died on July 3 after an extensive battle with Alzheimer’s. Jim was a longtime Class of ’53 president and at the same time was our alumni magazine columnist. When he retired as our correspondent, it took four of us to take his place! Even back when we were Phi Psi pledges together, Jim wanted to be a journalist. He worked at the Cornell Daily Sun and, after serving in the Air Force, he joined the New York Daily News, where he worked for his entire career. He served as historian of the Cornell Football Assn. for many years and contributed hundreds of articles to their seasonal newsletters and home-game programs, highlighting the storied history of Cornell football. His work in 2004–05 researching and gathering memorabilia and artifacts led to the creation of the football program’s Tradition Room. As a result, he was inducted into CU’s Athletics Hall of Fame during Homecoming weekend 2019. A longtime member of the Cornell University Council and the Student and Academic Services Advisory Council, he also served as the volunteer coordinator for the Continuous Reunion Club for more than 40 years. In 2015, he was chosen to receive the Frank H.T. Rhodes Exemplary Alumni Service Award, Cornell’s top award celebrating extraordinary service to the University through volunteer activities. Jim was the only Cornellian to win both that and the William “Bill” Vanneman ’31 Outstanding Class Leader Award, other than Bill Vanneman himself.\n\nEd Gibson (edwincosgibson@gmail.com) reports that his youngest daughter, Cosby, is developing as a songwriter and folk singer. You can check her out on her website. Ed says, “I’m very happy to have been isolated in the North Carolina mountains during the pandemic and I enjoy cocktail hour and staying alive.” Alan Quinby reports that he has a new address in Sarasota, FL. Joyce Wisbaum Underberg, BS ’52, feels fortunate that she got through the pandemic with little change to her life, other than being very bored. “My four kids and nine grandkids are all healthy and, I think, happy. I’m approaching the big ‘90,’ but feeling pretty spry. I still do organization work, read a lot, and play golf here in Rochester. My motto is: Carry on!”\n\nPlease keep your messages coming. ❖ John Nixon, nixn1@hotmail.com; Jack Allen, jwallen@msu.edu; Ed Gibson, edwincosgibson@gmail.com; Caroline Mulford Owens, 53news.cornell@gmail.com. Online news form.\n\n1954\n\nWhile most of us were hunkered down at home to avoid COVID exposure in early 2020, Ed and Joyce Dudley McDowell ’57, of Kilauea, HI, and Hermosa Beach, CA, were flying to Santiago, Chile, on the way to their umpteenth visit to Antarctica, a destination they call their favorite place on earth. It was their first trip back in ten years and they noted many changes: larger ships, more fellow travelers, rotated embarkation times, and no strolling or beach combing. Nonetheless they had an exhilarating excursion, despite Joyce’s losing a hearing aid to the sea and suffering a nosebleed problem as well. The last night in Antarctica they sailed through the Lemaire Channel in bright sunshine with icebergs jutting everywhere and reflecting the glinting sunlight. Their last view of Antarctica was in the same place as their first, back in 1986. In March they were preparing for a wildlife safari in India including tigers in the wild, but three days before departure, India closed its borders. After dodging that bullet, the McDowells finally did what the rest of us did in 2020 … stayed home, read books, and tended flowers. We hope 2021 has been better for them.\n\nJean Lanigan Lenehan of Radnor, PA, writes that she will miss the printed issues of CAM and hopes the powers that be will arrive at a solution. Stay tuned, Jean; a print subscription solution with a moderate annual price tag is in the works. Stan Birer, JD ’58, of Flossmoor, IL (imsrb@hotmail.com) advises that he is “very retired.” Stan and his wife, Lois, are both life directors of the Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra and do a lot of work to keep music alive in their state. He looks forward to our 2024 Reunion.\n\nJohn Donahoe of Pelham, NY (johndonahoe@aol.com) is also retired, having owned and run a successful sales recruiting company for 30-plus years. John is thrilled to report that his grandson William Serlin ’25 is a member of the freshman class that arrives in Ithaca this fall. Delvin Fanning, MS ’59 (delvindel@aol.com) of Riverdale, MD, is an emeritus professor at the U. of Maryland, having retired from teaching in 1999. Delvin is a renowned soil scientist and is still active as the newsletter editor of MAPSS, the Mid-Atlantic Assn. of Professional Soil Scientists. He hopes to participate in the 9th Int’l Acid Sulfate Soils Conference meeting in Adelaide, Australia, this November. He also hoped to celebrate his 90th birthday in July at his birthplace, near Copenhagen, NY. Bill Pinchbeck (wpinchbeck@yahoo.com) is retired and now living in a home all on one floor in beautiful Berlin, VT, where he enjoys playing the clarinet and sax as he did with the Cornell band during his undergrad days. Bill and his wife, Joanie, still own a cottage in Guilford, CT, on Long Island Sound, where they are able to summer again as the pandemic wanes.\n\nOur class webmaster, Jan Jakes Kunz (jjk.jaj3354@gmail.com), sent us the following note that we are happy to share with all our ’54 readers: “Tired of bingeing on old TV shows during the pandemic? Spend some time on campus by going to our class website, whose ‘Get Involved’ page has links to Cybertower and CornellCast, two sites that will change your life. You can immerse yourself in videos on an amazing variety of topics—everything from politics to outer space and even diets, plus talks by Sandy Weill ’55, John Cleese, professors, students, alums, and just friends of Cornell. While you’re on the page, you can also shop at the Cornell Store or keep up with Cornell sports news. Then, stop on the website’s ‘Community’ page to travel the world, no mask required.

Online news form.\n\n1955\n\nA welcome note from Herb Roleke: “Settled in after two years in our retirement community. We have a daughter nearby in Stuart, FL, who keeps us up to date. Family and friends from up North love to visit, as we have a house for them to stay at. With our daughter, we manage our real estate, which consists of several business properties, and our income has remained good because of it.” The most satisfaction in Herb’s life comes from “a happy marriage of 65-plus years to Mary Ann, and our lovely family.”\n\nBarbara Loreto Peltz wrote on April 20 from “the beautiful East End of Long Island.” She reports, “The ospreys have returned to their nests and the daffodils are in bloom. And I had my first indoor bridge game with real people yesterday.” Barb was happy to recognize that she has “internal resources to survive,” and it helps that she enjoys reading and taking part in a “delightful book club.” Good news from an old friend. Peter Eschweiler is “trying to be as retired as possible.” After retiring in 1991, he was active in a senior housing project in Pleasantville, NY, and he also chaired a lecture series for seniors at the public library, which has been suspended due to the pandemic. Peter’s wife, Mickie (Symonds) ’53, has Alzheimer’s, but “she is still as bright and cheerful as she can be,” Peter reports, and his satisfaction comes from “keeping Mickie safe and happy.” We wish you well. Pete says that his biggest takeaway from the pandemic is “enjoying our togetherness.”\n\nBarbara Brott Myers sent in her email address for friends and roommates to note: bjmyers1955@gmail.com. Buck Cody can be reached in Naples, FL, and his email is buckcody@orlandotelco.net. He explains, “Since my wife passed, some things have changed.” He still spends summers in Old Saybrook, CT, and has downsized his golfing from four times a week to two. “But I’m still above ground and reasonably healthy, and I thank God for that!”\n\nDavid Berler, MD ’58, who lives in Chevy Chase, MD, is enjoying lots of golf, tennis, outdoor and gym exercise, and family visits, especially since his vaccination. He says, “COVID has brought Zoom into our lives!” When asked about his biggest takeaway from the pandemic, David commented about the “ability of people to adjust and work from home,” plus “virtual experiences and medical awareness.” On the same point, Sylvia Verin Mangalam, MA ’57 (aw361@chebucto.ns.ca) feels “lucky to live in the Atlantic bubble” with less COVID worries. Her takeaway thought was “the need for a guaranteed annual income.” Sylvia’s complaint is that her eyes are “down the tubes—a real drag.” She adds, “No more tree climbing. At 87, I still play the recorder and write protest letters.” You go, girl!\n\nInteresting news from Robert Wyvill (“a.k.a. Fr. Christopher, OSB,” he writes) who lives in Washington, DC. “After NROTC at Cornell and three years on active duty aboard a destroyer, I joined a Catholic Benedictine Abbey, a monastery in Washington, DC. Now, at age 90 and in good health, I am very grateful to God for stability here for 60 years. Much has changed, but more has been the same within the monastery. I am grateful for living with 11 brother monks and no virus cases, which allows daily face-to-face social interaction without masks within the monastery, not the isolation that many elderly suffer.”\n\nThanks to everyone who’s submitting their news.

Online news form.\n\n1956\n\nThe Super Class of 1956 had our 65th Reunion by Zoom, a first for us. A fascinating talk by Corey Earle ’07, Cornell’s unofficial historian, described the reasons the Class of ’56 was and is still the “Super Class.” His talk was followed by one-hour get-acquainted mixers. For those of you who attended, we would love to hear your comments. And thanks to our Reunion chair Carole Rapp Thompson for her efforts in making this happen.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the Inst. of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) has created the IMS Grace [Goldsmith] Wahba Award and Lecture, to honor Grace’s “monumental contributions to statistics and science; pioneering and influential work in mathematical statistics; machine learning and optimization; broad and career-long interdisciplinary collaborations that have had a significant impact in the fields of epidemiology, bioinformatics, and climate sciences; and outstanding mentoring during her 51-year career as an educator.”\n\nMike Fawer (New Orleans, LA) spent 50-plus years as a defense attorney. During his career, he argued more than 125 cases and one before the US Supreme Court. His book is titled From the Bronx to the Bayou: A Defense Attorney’s Odyssey From Charles Evers to Edwin Edwards and Beyond. Learn more here. ❖ Phyllis Bosworth, phylboz@aol.com. Online news form.\n\n1957\n\nEd ’54 and Joyce Dudley McDowell have not missed much while coping with their altered lifestyle during the pandemic. A tour of Antarctica proved daunting due to too many passengers and excursions that would test the endurance of a sophomore. That didn’t slow them down as they prepared for a wildlife safari in India, only to have the borders of that country closed. Joyce has decided to read the entire collection of Dickens’s novels and has come up with a means to extend the life of orchids—she puts the spent orchids in the shower (plenty of humidity and a handy skylight).\n\nJane Tabor Gillett, BS ’80, has her own book, Kids Aren’t Baby Goats, available on Amazon, and is also working on a book of her poems. Now that things have opened up to some degree, an RV might be in her future. Speaking of travel, Tom and Shirley Besemer Itin, BS ’00, are contemplating a move from Michigan to either Utah and/or Arizona—to follow the westward migration of their children—where I’m sure Tom will continue his entrepreneurial pursuits.\n\nLawrence Abelman is still practicing trademark and copyright law in New York City, enjoying interaction with children and grandchildren. If he strolls across the Brooklyn Bridge, he can learn something of the construction of the bridge from the bronze plaques made by Bill Gold’s company. Bill is in the office every day, even though son Joshua ’01 runs the show at the foundry. John Herzog, founder of the Museum of American Finance and veteran of Wall Street—labors that took the family business from a few employees to a firm the size of which interested Merrill Lynch in purchasing it—now labors happily in his flower garden.\n\nPeter Wolf, ME ’59, is fully retired from 40 years on the Washington, DC, Superior Court, and he and Frances now reside in a retirement community in Winston Salem, NC, near their summer cottage in Roaring Gap. Peter is learning stop-motion photography and has mastered his Apple Watch. Michael De Nicola is quite active in the Optimist Club of Calgary (AB), a service organization focused on young people. Golf and reading take up a lot of the rest of his time. Elizabeth Cohen Theil, a Bacteriology major as an undergraduate with a doctoral degree in biochemistry (wow), resides in San Francisco, having achieved the title of emeritus after a career as a professor at North Carolina State U. ❖ John Seiler, suitcase2@aol.com.

Hopefully, all of you have not lost loved ones due to the epidemic!\n\nDick Stormont lost his wife of 59-plus years and has now moved into a prime continuing care facility in Buckhead near Atlanta. He has three married children and grandchildren who live in Atlanta. Jack Kelly also lost his wife right before Christmas and misses her greatly but is still working and helping manage the Kelly Group at J.P. Morgan with his two sons. He has six grandchildren living in Manhattan and New Jersey.\n\nDavid Hill has remarried and retired from his farming and beef cattle business. Daniel Seidel was manager of the 150-lb. crew for one season and has a memory he will never forget: “It was early spring and there were still ice floes and floating debris in the lake. One boat started taking in water as it hit an ice floe. We sent two boats back to the boathouse (no cell phones then) and took the crew back to the boathouse for showers. Then we went back to retrieve the shell, which took 12 men to haul out of the water! I don’t remember who was in that crew, but I’m sure they’ll never forget that night!”\n\nCharles Rosak gifted his two prize collector classic cars to his two daughters after over 50 years of ownership, but he is still active in classic car clubs. “Fortunately, everyone in my family is happy and healthy and enjoys getting together!” Chick Marshall had a knee replacement in January and missed traveling, family gatherings, etc., due to the pandemic, but he enjoyed cooking at home, collecting wine, and walks around the neighborhood. Chick is retired but helping friends in the restaurant business survive through the pandemic. He set up an email list of 60 Southern California restaurateurs to show info on government programs and ideas that were working to generate sales and profit during the epidemic. He enjoys sharing family times and being able to resume playing golf, fly fishing, bird hunting, and seeing friends. He thinks we will be dealing with the effects of the pandemic for a number of years. Travel, cruising, and dining out will continue to thrive in many ways that may not be to the liking of those in our generation.\n\nJack Wade, JD ’61, and his wife are still traveling and enjoying concerts! Six original Sherwoods are still alive and six have passed away, he writes. “Our last Sherwood Zoom session had two dozen participants.” Jack has three children, eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. He thinks the pandemic has been “Darwinian in every sense of the word.” Sonja Kischner Wilkin has kept busy during the pandemic, keeping a journal that is still ongoing! She says, “I made it through the year with my physical and mental health intact and I’m looking forward to getting back to a somewhat normal pace.” Zoom has become a big part of her life.\n\nDorinda Larkin McNamara (daelm3674@outlook.com) has moved to a retirement community in Southern Pines, NC, and would love to hear from classmates. Ann MacLeod Cashen (anncashen66@gmail.com) moved to Kimball Farms, a retirement community in Lenox, MA. She says, “So far so good,” and is looking forward to the return of Tanglewood programs. Ann is still volunteering and planning day trips for fellow residents of Kimball Farms. She is thankful for friends and family who have all stayed well during the pandemic. She still loves to read and was looking forward to the return of movies in the theater! ❖ Jan Arps Jarvie, janjarvie@gmail.com; Dick Haggard, richardhaggard11@gmail.com. Online news form.\n\n1959\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a broad range of adjustments and changes in our lives, well-reflected in classmates’ responses to the Share Your News form question: “What brings you the most satisfaction in your life these days?” Perhaps the most unexpected answer comes from Ed Wind of Huntington, NY: “Hanging out with my three chickens raised since the pandemic began.” For more than 50 years, Ed has worked full time teaching med students and interpreting X-rays. Previously at North Shore U. Hospital, he’s now a radiologist in the Northwell Health system. His medical career surely served as inspiration within the family: Ed’s son is a pathologist, his daughter is the program director at the Coalition for Healthy School Food, and his oldest grandson is a medical student at the U. of Illinois.\n\nPaul Rosenberg (par1@nyu.edu) is another full-timer, still at the NYU College of Dentistry, where he’s a professor in the Dept. of Endodontics. He’s wondering if his family set an “Olympic record” this past year, with four of his granddaughters at Cornell: Alexandra ’21, Hannah ’23, Madeline ’23, and Samantha ’24. What brings Paul the most satisfaction these days? “Family, painting portraits, LIFE!” Abe Lieberman’s Memories of a Brain Doctor, published last year, is now available in both paperback and Kindle formats. Abe, who lives in the Phoenix, AZ, area, is a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson’s disease. The book takes us from Abe’s childhood in NYC’s Brownsville (then home to Murder Inc.) to his days at Cornell and his medical practice and research, providing insights into people whom Abe cared for, such as Muhammad Ali, or studied, such as Adolf Hitler.\n\nSeveral folks spoke of technology in responding to another question on the Share Your News form: “What has been your biggest takeaway from the pandemic?” “Zoom-style meetings,” says Phyllis Corwin Rogers (rogersvc@sonic.net), who finds phone and Zoom calls with family and friends a joy. “Tech innovation has changed things, and many of these changes will stay with us,” writes Bill Dring, BArch ’61 (billdring@comcast.net). “I’m very involved in music (still an occasional gig), books, and outdoor activities,” says Patricia Hurley of Ivoryton, CT. “I have been fortunate to be living in a semi-rural area with many opportunities to be outdoors during the pandemic. I have also been able to continue directing my New Horizons Band and teaching my trumpet students, first on Zoom and now in person.”\n\n“The number of deaths from the pandemic has been horrifying, including my Cornell and high school classmate Larry Glassberg,” writes Mary Ella Harman Feinleib of Cambridge, MA. Mary Ella finds much satisfaction from memoir writing. She has written over 100 short memoirs and continues to take a memoir-writing course. She also participates in a French conversation group and recently started studying German, a language she once spoke well but had forgotten. After a former life as biology professor, department chair, and dean at Tufts, she became a travel consultant—an occupation that effectively disappeared during the pandemic but is cautiously picking up. “One client canceled his planned trip to Nepal and has decided, for now, to go to California. Another client originally wanted to go to Germany but backed out and is going to Iceland, where the incidence of COVID is very low.”\n\n“Thinking of others and making their days brighter” is what brings satisfaction to Jo Ellis Jones. For more than 50 years, Jo has lived in Alma, MI, having moved there with her now-deceased husband, Fred ’57, BS ’59, and their daughters when Fred took a job in the area with General Electric. For 42 years, she has served as the nutrition site manager for congregate meals at a food site in nearby Ithaca, MI. That job expanded with the opening of a senior activity building in 1993; Jo became the center’s director, a position she still holds. “The building has been closed since March 2020. I make many phone visits with the seniors to encourage them to take good care of themselves while we await the time when we can resume the programs, activities, and meals they so enjoyed.”\n\nDave and Peggy Flynn Dunlop, MS ’63 (thedunlops59@gmail.com) have moved from their home of 56 years in Brooktondale to Kendal at Ithaca, joining four other ’59ers living there: Pat Williams, Hank Stark, Carol Hardy, PhD ’81, and Bobbie Greig Schneider. Ron and Sally Schwartz Muzii (sallymuzii@bellsouth.net) are proud great-grandparents of Conner, born in April, and within two months already the subject of 200-plus photos on Sally’s cell phone. Both Ron and Sally continue to lead busy lives. “Ron will never retire!” comments Sally, “but he has started to take a day off during the week from his hotel marketing and consulting firm.” Sally, who had to give up tennis about seven years ago, stays busy with croquet and golf. Since 2019 she has been a referee with the US Croquet Assn., which entitles her to be called upon for local tournaments. She also teaches croquet beginners at the PGA National Resort and Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. She still plays golf with the WGA in both Florida and North Carolina—“but unlike the gentlemen golfers, I have never shot my age (or even gotten near it). Looks like I will have to live for two more decades to claim that title!” ❖ Jenny Tesar, jet24@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\nBack to the top\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nBack in the spring, when the pandemic still dominated our lives, class council member Donald Milsten answered the question about how his daily life has changed: “Are you kidding? I’ve not only not been out of the country, I haven’t even been out of the county!” Writing from Pikesville, MD, Don says that he found time during the run-up to last year’s presidential election to make telephone calls to prospective voters, describing the experience as “interesting,” as in comedian Arte Johnson’s schtick on “Laugh-In.” He was also glad to note that his physician son, Andrew, an emergency medicine specialist at the U. of Massachusetts Medical Center, “is thrilled that the 18-plus-hour shifts associated with COVID are now at last in the rear-view mirror.” Don has nine grandchildren and says, “I have enough grandchildren stories to overfill an entire class column. All good, I’m happy to say.”\n\nStanley Watkins (stanleywatkins@comcast.net) reports that he retired in 2019 after 49 years of practicing medicine in Annapolis, MD, where he was a specialist in hematology and oncology and served as medical director of the Research Inst. at Anne Arundel Medical Center. These days, he says, “I currently farm, hunt, and fish.” My wife, Gail, is a full-time artist, and our two children are doing well. Elizabeth is a professor at the U. of Maryland, and son Stanley is a cardiologist and vascular surgeon in Anchorage, AK. We have five grandchildren, all doing well.” Another recently retired oncologist is Martin Schock, who lives with his wife, Carole, in Silver Spring, MD. “Because of COVID-19, I have been going back to previous hobbies of playing the piano and doing things alone. I have not been able to travel but would like to hear from Cornellians in this area of the country.” Now half-retired as a result of the pandemic is physician Michael Goldberg, an orthopedic specialist, who used to practice in both Seattle and Boston. “COVID made it impossible to continue my bi-coastal life, so I have retired from clinical practice at Seattle Children’s Hospital and am now full time in Boston, where I am scholar-in-residence at the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare.”\n\nAfter retiring from his general surgery practice at Ohio Permanente Medical Group 15 years ago, council member Roland Philip (Cleveland Heights, OH) became a volunteer at organizations like the Experience Corp., Cleveland Food Bank, and Hospice of the Western Reserve. “At the present time,” he says, “I am a member of the Cancer Institutional Review Board of University Hospitals of Cleveland and participate in the Novel Club of Cleveland and the Rowfant Club. My wife, Linda Sandhaus, who has retired from her pathologist position at University Hospital, is now a docent at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where she developed a lecture program on the impact of epidemics on art. My son, Joseph, is involved with medical record security at University Hospital, and my daughter, Sarah, teaches art in an independent school in Virginia. With the constraints of COVID, we have done no traveling but hope to visit the national parks in the Southwest this fall. And it’s almost countdown time for our 65th Reunion!”\n\nJudy Thompson Hamer (jahamer@att.net) writes from Redding, CT, that her life has been changed very little by the pandemic. “Three generations of my far-flung family meet via Zoom every other week; I’ve seen more of them lately than ever before. Yeah! All the groups I’m involved in made a seamless transition to Zoom, including a book group, a writing group, writing class, a meditation group, and exercise classes. In addition, I’m writing a memoir about my marriage to Bill G. Buckley; the working title is ‘Soul Mates.’ Ironically, after completing my dissertation on the teaching of writing, I promised myself never to write anything again. But, never say never.” Tom Dandridge, MBA ’62 (Rockford, MI) also coped well with COVID’s restrictions. “Throughout the pandemic year,” he says, “I managed to play in bridge tournaments. My regular partner twice a week was Jim Van Fleet, who lives in Virginia, while I played from Western Michigan.”\n\nStill busy raising Wagyu cattle at Emma Farms in Aspen, CO, Tom Waldeck is proud of the recent prizes his animals have won in competitions at Louisville, Denver, Houston, and elsewhere, including some grand championships. He and his wife, Vivian, have two children and several grandchildren, including one now enrolled at Tufts, twin granddaughters now applying to colleges, and two living near the Waldecks in Aspen and “enjoying the outdoor life.” Among the things bringing Tom the most satisfaction these days are family, friends, art, music, travel, and raising prize-winning cattle. Paula Friedman (Gresham, OR) says that while waiting for a second dose of the vaccine this spring and wondering what the next months would bring, she recalled a similar experience during her early childhood when “the grown-ups were all looking forward to when the war is over, but the war’s end brought a new terror, nuclear bombs. So while I’m hoping this year of shelter-in-place may open soon to our old, more expansive ways, I’m trying to prepare for if it doesn’t. I’m still doing freelance book editing, though clients have been rare this pandemic year, and am completing my third book for publication, ‘Of Elegant Time,’ a short story collection. Next—starting a vegetable garden!” Please keep sending your news to: ❖ Judy Bryant Wittenberg, jw275@cornell.edu. Online news form.\n\n1961\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our 60th (virtual) Reunion! For once in our memory, there was no rain, no cold chilly mornings, and no fatiguing walks to our old haunts. From June 10–12 we enjoyed a virtual get-together from the comfort of our homes and laptops. As a pandemic-restricted event, we were able to attract over 150 classmates attending our various Zoom meetings. Our Thursday cocktail party was an electronic meet-and-greet with the breakout rooms letting us renew memories with our classmates. Corey Earle ’07 regaled us the following morning with the on-campus events of our four years, most of which were lost in the mists of time—except for the Asian flu. Fifteen percent of us came down with the bug, including me, for almost two weeks. Following Corey Earle, Jack Neafsey, MBA ’63, gave a fine tribute to Peter Meinig, dedicating a memorial reading room at Uris Library in his honor and acknowledging his contributions to Cornell as a trustee and supporter of Cornell.\n\nClass president Dick Tatlow concluded our final breakout session on Saturday by thanking our Reunion committee of Carol Gittlin Franklin, Jim Moore, LLB ’64, and Marshall and Rosanna Romanelli Frank for working on our behalf to produce a fine event in difficult circumstances. Also, special thanks to Pat Laux Richards for all the tasks she undertook—and she has volunteered to continue on into our next five-year period. Pauline Sutta Degenfelder was recognized for her years spent pre-planning this event, and there was a special remembrance of Jay Treadwell for his many contributions to previous Reunions.\n\nA post-Reunion note from Sue Rand Lewis: “We took our own advice after the first ’61 breakout session and scheduled a Zoom reunion of the 40th and 45th Reunion chairs: Jon Greenleaf in Santa Barbara, CA, Peter (and Elke) Greenberg in Rockville Centre, NY, and Sue Lewis (and Gordon Garrett) in Sarasota, FL. We were unable to reach our fourth chair, Ginny Buchanan Clark in Fort Wayne, IN, but plan to have more of these gatherings until we can arrange to get together in person. In her stead, Gerrit White joined us for 45 minutes of stories, laughter, and catching up prior to the class cocktail party on Saturday. We found we were all well, active, and eager to get back together on the Hill when conditions will allow. In the meantime, we were very thankful for the efforts of this year’s Reunion chairs for bringing us together to reminisce via Zoom. All of us were also thankful that our time as Reunion chairs was then and not now!”\n\nNew input and an update from Reunion co-chair Carol Franklin: “With the pandemic, I am still working but doing much of it virtually. More residential clients now, but most of my many years of space-planning and interior design were for Fortune 500 corporations. I interact with friends from the Leonia, NJ, community and high school, family, and a book club with 14 SDT sorority sisters, as well as synagogue Gesher Shalom.”\n\nDorcas McDonald sent along an impressive portfolio describing the Learning for Living Inst., where she is the executive director. Located in Boulder, CO, the institute focuses on life success skills for young people. You may visit their website here. Also responding to our call for news is Garry Friedman, who retired from CBRE as a commercial real estate broker after 33 years and still maintains an active practice in Scarsdale. During the pandemic, his son was working remotely from Garry’s home conducting compliance investigations. His comment on the pandemic: “You learn to appreciate health and good company.”\n\nPeggy Thomas, our Pottery Lady, wrote from Ridgefield, CT, about life during the pandemic. “Luckily, COVID did not take away any close friends or loved ones. But it DID take away the ‘busy-ness’ of my daily life. It left me with time. I realized how free that felt. I had the time to become creative and explore new forms with my clay. I had the time to linger in my gardens and appreciate their beauty and bounty and all the work and time I had put into creating them. I had the time to revel in the silent solitude and surprises of nature as I cleared trails in my woods. I had the time to thoughtfully transcribe hundreds of letters written by my Dad and Mom during his three years overseas in WWII. I treasure this delightful and newfound gift of time. I promise myself to remain disentangled from my former busy life and concentrate on all the pleasures of my new leisure life. But then, of course, there is always Zoom.”\n\nRuth Schimel has just published her seventh book on Amazon, Happiness and Joy in Work: Preparing for Your Future (the only book with tailored guidance for individuals).

Online news form.\n\n1962\n\nContinuing the theme of notable professor memories, Otto Doering, PhD ’73, submits a story he calls “By Chance”: “When I was in the process of busting out the end of my sophomore year, I had to choose an advisor. I was a Government major and went to the department secretary for advice because she was one of the few people who had smiled at me. I explained that I was not up to having Rossiter or Hacker and then asked her, ‘Who is nice?’ Without any hesitation she responded, ‘George Kahin.’ I signed up and then proceeded to bust out. I spent four months wrangling horses in the Canadian Rockies (having never ridden a horse when I took the job) and six months preparing cases in the Municipal Courts of New York City. In fall 1961, Dean Perry was willing to let me back in, so I arrived in Ithaca to sign up for classes. I had to put together a class schedule with my advisor and then get signatures from those teaching the classes. I climbed the stairs to the attic of what was then Franklin Hall, where George Kahin had a plywood cubicle for an office. Two of the plastic chairs outside his door were occupied by a bird colonel from Army Intelligence and a ranking State Dept. officer. These were the early days of US on-the-ground involvement in Vietnam. I quickly learned that Kahin was an expert on Southeast Asia and likely the foremost expert on Vietnam. He spent more time with me than he did with the colonel and the Foreign Service officer.\n\n“I signed up for Kahin’s ‘The US and Asia’ class and received the first A I ever got at Cornell. I had never worked so hard for a class before. He put his faith in me, and I was desperate not to disappoint him. I then took his ‘Governments and Politics of Southeast Asia.’ These two classes were remarkable, drawing on Kahin’s post-war experiences in Southeast Asia, his wide-ranging knowledge, and his skills as a teacher. I did not have a lot of contact with him but felt he would help me if I needed it. I applied to the London School of Economics and, with my dismal undergraduate record, Kahin’s letter of recommendation was the only reason I got in. On finishing at the LSE, I was offered two jobs in Southeast Asia and made a good choice between them with Kahin’s advice. After four years away from Cornell, I returned with my wife and child for graduate work in another field. A month later, Kahin phoned out of the blue inviting my wife and me to dinner to meet someone he thought we should know. That individual became a lifelong friend. George Kahin continued to be a part of my life until his death. We visited every time I came to Ithaca and he and his wife visited us. I realize now that he quietly and unobtrusively watched out for me. I was never quite sure why. I certainly wasn’t a very impressive specimen when I arrived at his door to get him to sign my class schedule in 1961.”\n\nRick Kelly (kelrichop@gmail.com) writes: “In the 59 years since my graduation, most of which were spent in the hospitality industry, I have accumulated a great family, great friends, and an adventurous life in the US and abroad. Suffice to say, the Hotel school was the catalyst for all these wonderful memories. One salient memory of my time at Cornell involved one of the finest men I’ve ever met, Dean Robert Beck ’42, PhD ’54. When returning to the Hotel school, after a brief hiatus during which I acquired the practice credits I needed to graduate, I submitted my proposed class schedule to him; his response was classic Dean Beck, and I quote, ‘Kelly, if you are prepared to spend another year here, stick to this travesty—here is a more practical schedule that will see you out of here in June.’ At graduation, he addressed me with a smile on his face: ‘Kelly, we are finally getting rid of you!’”\n\nJoy Harwood Rogers, BS Nurs ’63, writes, “I kept this a secret, but I went to Cornell from Montreal, Canada, at age 16, not due to brilliance but because schools in Quebec at that time only had 11 grades and my birthday is late in the year. I told one date, and he withdrew in shock because, after all, I was jailbait. From then on, I told anyone who asked that I was 18! I was at Cornell for two years and then went to the nursing school in New York City. A fun fact is that Tony Fauci, MD ’66, was in the parallel medical school class. Professor Marchand was assigned to the nurses and welcomed us with dinner at his home, a really special occasion. The nursing school was three years, so I am actually a member of both the Class of ’62 and ’63. Tony Chan has been instrumental in orchestrating Zoom meetings for the nurses. Such fun to connect. I loved Cornell. It was a struggle, as I had not had any American history. Also, I noticed that all the American girls had a certain charm on their charm bracelet. I finally asked what it was for. Well, wouldn’t you know, it was the National Honor Society. My Canadian accent got me into trouble when I asked for a map and was queried about what I had spilled—my ‘map’ sounded like Upstate New York’s ‘mop’! So there were many cultural as well as academic challenges for me. I was fortunate that my brother Fred Harwood ’59 was two years ahead of me and really guided me through many hoops. I had great friends as dormmates and sorority sisters. They made me feel welcome. I remember all dates were study dates! I wonder if it’s still like that or if current students have to study as hard as we did. I loved walking to class in that gorgeous crispy snow, and then the blessing of the first days of spring. I feel blessed to have gone to Cornell and then to the nursing school, which sadly has since been closed. A great education led to a fun life and many great memories and lasting friendships.”\n\nPaul Marantz sends this story, called “Cornell Goes to the Dogs”: “When I warmly recall some of the most consequential high points of my time at Cornell, its canine population is not the first thing that comes to mind. Nonetheless, there’s no doubt that the lively group of dogs roaming the campus was a distinctive part of the Cornell scene. Rumor had it (though I have no idea whether there is any truth to the tale) that a benefactor had left money to Cornell on the express condition that dogs have the run of the campus. In any case, whether this folk tale was true or false, there was a happy pack of dogs that freely wandered the campus, passing in and out of the buildings unhindered. Most prominent among them was Tripod, a huge, majestic dog who, despite missing a front paw, ruled the pack and roamed near and far in regal splendor. The coming and going of the dogs was usually uneventful, but on one occasion, in the middle of a large lecture class, a couple of amorous dogs moved front and center into a broad aisle and began to copulate. We were all transfixed by this unexpected spectacle, but the instructor (whom my fallible memory recalls as the prominent political scientist Ted Lowi), perhaps being more worldly than we were, was completely unruffled. He made some brief comment acknowledging the unusual activity and calmly proceeded with his lecture. Some 60 years later, while having strong memories of his impressively calm demeanor, I can’t remember what he had to say, and the copulating dogs remain a vivid memory of my time at Cornell.” And on that note, I invite you to search your brains for stories of your time at Cornell! ❖ Evelyn Eskin, evelyneskin@mac.com.

Robert Sze writes, “As all cultural activities ceased ’round the Boston area and Harvard classes went remote, my wife, Corinne, and I got very sick of walking the streets of mid-Cambridge. On August 17, 2020, we worked up the courage and took a plane back to our home in Santa Fe, NM. I haven’t actually worked on the home for some 20 years and there was much to do on the landscaping around the house. I have also started a project of making very complicated drawings that take days to complete—started with Frank Lloyd Wright’s buildings. Our son returned to Santa Fe with family about two and a half years ago, so it’s been great to babysit our grandchildren. We love the great scenery of the Sangre de Cristo Range.”\n\nGeorge Ehemann, ME ’66 (ehemanng@comcast.net) and his wife, Diane (Siegenthaler), live in Lancaster, PA. He wrote, “We will celebrate our 57th anniversary in September. Our oldest child is a Corning manufacturing manager; our youngest is a teacher in Tennessee; and our middle child works for Delaware Parks and Rec. I am active in church and choral groups, plus I volunteer as a math tutor in public schools. Grandson Ben has enrolled in Cornell Engineering Class of 2025.” John, MBA ’65, and Cecelia Kennedy write, “Like just about everyone, our lives changed dramatically over the last year. We have both hunkered down. We did build our new house in North Carolina last year and moved in July. We are now building a new house in Florida that will be ready in April. I am proud of my nine college graduate children and their successes, and my 24 grandchildren with more upside potential.” His biggest takeaways from the pandemic: “Trust my instincts regarding being cautious, wear a mask, wash hands, and social distance.”\n\nRon and Gail Berlin Makara (gailmaui@aol.com) live in Santa Rosa, CA, where they have been since 2004. “We’re in the same boat as everyone else—being in wine country makes it easier. Come visit Sonoma!” Gail adds, “Our family, our friends, and ourselves are safe and healthy, and we’re moving on.” Martin, DVM ’66 (martinwolf105@gmail.com) and Debra Kirschner Wolf ’66 live in West Palm Beach, FL. When asked how their daily lives changed, Marty writes, “We’re at Ibis Country Club—a 365-day-a-year camp. I do a lot of art work, mainly mosaic art, some painting, and photography. We have two kids and six grandkids. Son Jeff is a pulmonologist on the front line. Daughter Michelle is CEO of an invitation company. Grandson Kyle Wolf ’25 was accepted early decision for the coming year.”\n\nJoan Travers Barist (joan@joanbarist.com) and her husband, Jeffrey, live in Washington Depot, CT. “We left our wonderful life in NYC and moved in March 2020 to our home in Litchfield County, CT. Have been reading, cooking, walking, and taking online classes. Hoping to return to NYC and our favorite museums, ballet, and opera. I have read more books in one year than in a lifetime—it hasn’t been a total waste.” Madeleine Leston Meehan admits that she is a dinosaur since she doesn’t do email. She writes that the lockdown affected every part of her life. She is “stuck in paradise” (St. Thomas, Virgin Islands), has done more reading, and notes that she’s had “time to think how silly and wonderful the world is, especially since we’re living longer than most people facing octogenarianism.”\n\nHal Spitzer, BArch ’66, and his husband, Tom Martin, live in Hamden, CT. Hal says, “I closed my architectural firm in NYC in 2006. I don’t do any more projects. I work solely as building architect for co-ops and condos in NYC. I am very active in nonprofit organizations. I thought I had lived long enough to know how my senior years would play out. The pandemic cured me of that presumption.” Gordon and Mary Priedeman live in Lake Oswego, OR. “Because of COVID and my age, I gave up my volunteer work last March as a docent at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport. I had volunteered there since 2002. What brings me the most satisfaction these days is my family and backyard birds.”\n\nMarty, BEE ’65 (martylustig@gmail.com) and Dianne Flannery Lustig ’66 live in Prairie Village, KS. Marty writes, “My Cornell five-year Engineering education enabled me to start a small-time handyman business. I do this on both a volunteer and a for-profit basis. The handyman business has allowed me to engage my grandkids at various stages, to talk with them and teach them a few things, and they, in turn, help me carry heavy stuff. I am no longer running due to too many back surgeries but still ride my bike. Dianne, already an outstanding cook, has become an expert in baking. She is also an expert (IMHO) needlepointer and is vice president of the local Needlepoint Guild chapter and teaches classes. I am also president of the Cornell Club of Mid-America.

Or at least COVID-free enough that you’re hopefully more active and up to sending me your latest news. Here’s what we have to share now.\n\nJames Glover, who lives with wife Connie in Cambridge, MD, writes that he’s teaching part time at area colleges and universities and also does personal counseling and coaching with students. He’s into bird watching, fishing, and travel—the last most recently to St. George, UT. The Glover family enjoys teaching, boating, and travel. Benjamin Brown has made an in-state move, from Hollis to Milford, NH. Lillian Clickner Schleede and husband Fred ’63 also recently moved in-state, from Norfolk to Virginia Beach, VA. Lillian is retired and enjoys feeding birds, being in her church choir, reading books, and visiting with grandchildren.\n\nMichelle “Mickey” Katz hasn’t been in this column in 23 years. She notes that she is an attorney/mediator, and she and husband Bob Shayne live in Los Angeles, CA. Diane Herson Franklin was last here in 2000, and shares that she and husband Steve live in Wilmington, DE. Wistar Morris and Anthony DeLaurentis were last in our July 2004 column, and both report new addresses—Anthony and wife Helen in Crofton, MD, and Wistar and wife Martha in Bryn Mawr, PA. Warren Jones, last here a decade ago, notes he and wife Kathleen still live in Wilmington, NC.\n\nRichard Reed (richardreed42@att.net) has lots of news! He recently finished authoring his Martian “hard science fiction” trilogy, Distant Ancient Sky: A Martian Adventure, Ghosts Do Dance, and Outposts of Mars. Richard also wrote a play in honor of his late wife, Sharon: Grandpa’s Pixies, a comedy-drama he considers apt for middle- or high-school audiences and community theater. Richard otherwise runs a burger shack near his Bellaire home in Houston, TX, with his daughters, that specializes in bison meat. He also enjoys heirloom gardening and seeing his five grandchildren. With all else, he notes his biggest takeaway from the pandemic as “survival.”\n\nLois Weyman Dow certainly knows what survival can mean. She and husband William Rowe were struck with, in her terms, unplanned “downsizing” in August 2020 when a tornado uprooted a tree that then crashed into their house in Delaware, ripping up the roof and ruining their living room and master bedroom. Then in mid-December, a raging ice storm uprooted more trees that fell upon and ruined the just-repaired roof plus garage doors. Lois reports they got by thanks to helpful neighbors and supportive insurance. They now are in the process of moving to a retirement community in Henrico, VA, where they will be close to both their son’s and daughter’s families.\n\nAlan Goldenberg, BCE ’66, reports navigating through the pandemic by “reading a couple of books a week and doing lots of puzzles.” He and wife Barbara (Greenwell) ’68 otherwise managed to vacation in India and Nepal in early 2020, but then had three vacations postponed to this year, then two of them put off until 2022. When the Goldenbergs do travel, it’s from their home in Oakland, CA. Barbara Cade Pringle, MA ’68, last in this column seven years ago, says she and her husband, Bob, PhD ’67, have just published a two-volume memoir, Friendly Fires: Recollections of a Diplomatic Family, on their many years abroad in Southeast Asia and Africa—he as a Foreign Service officer, she as an itinerant teacher. Barbara says she taught children from sixth grade to university level, covering various subjects but mostly history, her Cornell major. The Pringles now live in Alexandria, VA. Nancy Greyson Beckerman (nancybgb@verizon.net), who lives in Pound Ridge, NY, reports her husband, Barry ’61, died in 2001.\n\nAnn Wilson Rounds lives in Superior, CO, near Boulder, but travels to Hawaii where her older daughter lives, and to New Hampshire to be with her sister. She otherwise plans international travel once the pandemic is done with. Ann is a retired high school English teacher but still does tutoring. She also is a coordinator for the Boulder Newcomers’ Club, plus plays the piano and enjoys being with her grandchildren. Chuck Zambito reports that Zambito Produce Sales is now a part-time business, selling “a few potatoes, oranges, etc.” Chuck also continues with the New Jersey Agricultural Society and New Jersey Farmers Against Hunger. He and wife Barbara live in Haddon Heights, NJ. Charles Oliver, who lives in Canaseraga, NY, for half the year, writes he’s still involved in his business (sale of farm and garden machinery) but is turning it over to his two sons. Charles spends winters in Florida, but “loves New England, especially New Hampshire, which we try to visit every two to three years.” Michael “Tim” Graves shows a sarcastic bent when he writes of “enjoying the pleasures of the pandemic lockdown.” He otherwise notes, “We are in disbelief that our oldest granddaughter is already in the college search and application process. And her sister is not far behind.” Tim and wife Suzanne live in Fairport, NY.\n\nThat’s our word limit for now.

Online news form.\n\n1965\n\nHenry Nave, ME ’67, and wife Michele almost managed through the COVID crisis unscathed, but Michele did have a mild case. Henry is writing a book on construction, “Bidding, Building, Busting,” which follows the pathway of a construction life, and he believes it will give useful career marketing advice to college-level engineers. His current activity is doing arbitration work on construction disputes. Teaching Bible study classes brings him much satisfaction. “We can all get through problems if we deal with facts rather than politics,” he writes, when asked about his takeaway from the pandemic.\n\nLive theater and musical performances are two things Judith Russell Davidson missed most during the pandemic. She also missed duplicate bridge but was able to enjoy playing chamber music and reading a lot of books. Happily, she was looking forward to a summer visit from her daughter and newest baby in July 2021. Key to her work in retirement is managing the family charitable foundation. Gretchen Wunsch Bronke and Henry have moved to a lovely in-law apartment attached to a new home their son Kevin and his family have built. They are able to help babysit their autistic 5-year-old and welcome the opportunity to share meals. A pandemic disappointment has been the inability to travel. Luckily, however, they could occasionally see grandchildren!\n\nCarolyn Arvanites Kennedy, MAT ’66 (ckennedy43@sbcglobal.net) shared, “I had a stroke recently and, although mild, a few months later I still tire easily and need help with meal prep and clean up.” She’s now more diligent paying attention to healthy eating and regular exercise. Carolyn has a granddaughter in Finland and comments, “My grandson plans to study engineering in college, like his grandfather W. Keith Kennedy Jr., PhD ’68.” Carolyn expresses gratitude for her years at Cornell with the opportunity to meet marvelous students from all over the US and Europe as well as the experience to learn from wonderful professors and attend plays and concerts on campus.\n\nAnother classmate with a challenging medical issue is Dennis Black (dbblack@gmail.com). “I was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2020 and had surgery, radiation, and chemo. Received a hopeful prognosis in 2021 and plan to go on planning for the future.” His upbeat attitude allows him to continue working part time at Mesirow Financial, and the chairman of the board has announced that Dennis is not allowed to retire. Dennis and his wife, Joyce (Ostroff) ’66, are proud that grandson Aidan ’25 will start Cornell as a freshman, a third generation! Dennis is completing the last two installments of a $1 million challenge grant to support Posse Chicago Foundation at Cornell. The Posse Foundation is a student opportunities and youth leadership program that matches promising high school students with top-tier colleges and universities across the US.\n\nSubstitute teaching and private early-school-age tutoring provided enriching experience for Meri Klorman Schreiber (meri.schreiber28@gmail.com). Meri and husband Paul ’62 live in North Easton, MA, and stayed close to home but did take some trips to New Jersey to see their three sons and eight grandchildren. John Mitchell states, “My retirement activities include: off-road mountain biking, volunteering at the local food bank, taking care of school children, and a program of continuing education. My most satisfaction comes from my good health, enabling me to have an active lifestyle and be with family and friends.” He believes his good health kept him from getting infected. John has one son and two grandchildren.\n\nBob McCabe, BS ’67, MBA ’70 (RobertJMcCabe@aol.com) manages a full load of civic responsibility. He was elected to the Vero Beach City Council in November and is also president of the Vero Beach Chamber of Commerce and treasurer of the Sunrise Rotary Club of the Vero Beach Foundation. “Running a political campaign with minimal personal contact was a real challenge!” He and his wife welcomed their seventh grandchild in December.\n\nAlong with many other classmates, Dianne Zimet Newman and husband Martin were impacted by the COVID restrictions that did not allow travel to children and grandchildren. When this column appears, I join with others in trusting we are all vaccinated and can appreciate the opening of the country and the easing of travel restrictions. Dianne comments she has taken several courses via Zoom with classmates who live in the UK, France, and Israel, and all over the US. She volunteers with the Women’s Fund of Rhode Island, the Jewish Community Day School of Rhode Island, the Fuchsberg Center in Jerusalem, and Cornell. Applause for her chairmanship of CAAAN Rhode Island, a position she has held for more than 20 years.\n\n“The important elements in life can be prioritized and honed down to simple things, like staying healthy and keeping in touch with loved ones, along with helping those in need,” writes Henra Solomon Briskin (henpen20@aol.com). She further commented, “Everything changed once the virus hit—all the little and big things from whether to grocery shop or have food delivered, to canceling family visits and trips. Mostly I stayed in my own cocoon and Zoomed with relatives and friends.” Zoom also allowed her to attend concerts, lectures, and plays. Alex Mastoris, MS ’67 (AlexNMastoris@gmail.com) opened a new steakhouse restaurant, Rocco’s at the Brick, in Newtown, PA. “Retiring five years ago was not for me.” He loves being back in the business and comments on “how drastically the pandemic hurt our hospitality industry, both hotels and restaurants.” Alex now has six great-grandchildren! ❖ Joan Hens Johnson, joanipat@gmail.com; Stephen Appell, bigred1965@aol.com.

At the kick-off session, Alice Katz Berglas welcomed us and then presented our gift, “ThrivingRED/The Arts,” to Ryan Lombardi, Cornell’s VP for Student and Campus Life. The gift continues our support for students in West Campus housing. Ryan described the focus on well-being and mental health to get the students through this year. The gift acceptance was followed by a fascinating presentation by Roberta Moudry ’81, PhD ’95, on “New North,” the five residences under construction on North Campus. Her talk included a history of residential life at Cornell, starting with the policy that no students would live on campus and were expected to locate accommodations in the community, to today’s efforts to enhance campus living as a significant component of the University experience. For the first time in its history, Cornell will become a truly residential university, with all freshmen and sophomores required to live on campus—in dormitories, program houses, cooperatives, fraternities, or sororities.\n\nOur forum on Thursday was a presentation by former Cornell professor Fredrik Logevall on JFK in 2021, a look back at his life and ours. Prof. Logevall raised some thought-provoking questions on how Kennedy worked and what could have happened if he had lived through two terms. Breakout sessions to develop these thoughts followed. Our Friday social hour and ice cream party started with Judy Kurtz Polcer introducing Paul Merrill, director of Cornell Jazz Ensembles. He has performed at our last three Reunions (with Judy as vocalist). He explained how the student groups were able to perform even if they could not be together. Using a computer program that could put multiple players together almost instantly as they played from individual rooms in Lincoln Hall made for some great music. This was followed by our party in breakout rooms. It was great to see and talk to classmates. Mimi Vu represented her father, Khoi “Kenny” Vu, who recently passed. She was interested in speaking with classmates who knew him during his years as an Engineering student at Cornell. Many thanks to Alice Katz Berglas and Mary Jansen Everett and all who worked on making this Reunion a success! We look forward to our 60th.\n\nNow on to classmate news. Kathleen Earle Fox (mainewatercolors@gmail.com) is currently completing a book describing the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania, which will be published by the History Press in late 2021 or early 2022. She is still an active watercolor artist and had a show at the Granite Gallery in Tenants Harbor, ME, this summer. When asked what she never imagined doing/being when we graduated, she responded, “Being 76 years old!” Nathaniel Pierce earned the distinction of winning the New Yorker magazine cartoon captioning contest! His winning entry appeared in the March 15, 2021 issue.\n\nJeanne Duchow Solomon, BA ’68 (jeanksolomonmd@aol.com) and husband Bill still live in Pebble Beach, CA, where she was a family medicine physician until her retirement two years ago. As an English major, she was surprised to end up enjoying the sciences. She came to Cornell from Puerto Rico; her family moved there when she was 7. She found Cornell a fantastic place to grow in knowledge and experience. Between junior and senior year, she did a “junior year abroad,” going to the U. of the Seven Seas twice—two times on a cruise ship around the world. Then she returned to Cornell to graduate. After “typical English graduate” jobs, she detoured to science. She wishes she could live it all over again—fun but with scary turns. She knows we will always be bonded by having spent pivotal years together. Jeanne attended her first Reunion this year!\n\nJohn Bayersdorfer (jdbayersdorfer@gmail.com) had a career in marketing management in New York, California, and North Carolina, primarily in the textile industry. He retired as international VP for marketing for Cone Mills Inc. With his wife, he now co-owns Nanco Travel Services, specializing in unique travel adventures. John himself has traveled to more than 80 nations. His civic activities have included past board member and president of Montclair, NJ, lacrosse and ice hockey clubs, and he is a certified ice hockey referee. He was cofounder of the Triad Lacrosse Association in Greensboro, NC, and is a board member of the Kiwanis Club of Greensboro. John’s son is a two-time collegiate lacrosse All-American.\n\nSteve Krich, PhD ’72 (krich.steven@gmail.com) moved from Lexington, MA, to Cambridge, MA, a few years ago. An active cyclist, over the past 15 years he has biked from California to Florida; the Rhine River; and the German/Polish border to Tallinn, Estonia. He climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro for second time with family. He says he never imagined he would learn conversational Hebrew. Vacations include volunteering on an Israeli army base and a Budapest-to-Amsterdam river cruise. Steve and his wife summer at their home in the Berkshires, where kids and grandkids join them.\n\nSadly, we learned of the passing of class correspondent Deanne Gebell Gitner in May. Deanne was active in charitable organizations. She was a journalist, writing and editing for her local newspaper. She later became communications coordinator for the Millburn, NJ, public school system. Deanne was a life member of the Cornell Council and involved in many Cornell activities. ❖ Susan Rockford Bittker, ladyscienc@aol.com; Pete Salinger, peteRsalinger95@gmail.com.

Great because we are closer to three of our children. Not so great because our other two children are farther away.” Gary is business manager for a family retail store, Maple’s Farmhouse LLC in North Chesterfield. “COVID has locked us up and we haven’t been able to have a full family vacation or travel,” he adds, noting that the most satisfaction in his life comes from “children, grandchildren, and work.” What’s his biggest takeaway from the pandemic? “Someone who will remain nameless should have taken this COVID-19 much more seriously!”\n\nDave, BS ’69, and Becky DeBell (Surprise, AZ; blackbearbecky2@hotmail.com) “just moved to Arizona from Florida (March 2021). Arthritis drove us from ‘high’ to ‘very low’ humidity. First retirement was in July 2011, second retirement was in July 2016, and I am now mentoring those who are interested. Two grandchildren are at Grand Canyon U. in Phoenix, so it’s nice to be close to them.” Satisfaction comes from “staying in shape, experiencing new things, and landscaping our big backyard.” Pandemic takeaway: “Practice proper techniques and get vaccinated! We got ours and are doing fine.”\n\nIvan Blum, ME ’68, MBA ’69 (Southbury, CT; ivanjblum11@gmail.com) “retired from Deloitte and from IBM. I’m an adjunct professor of statistics, analytics, and operations management. Still working on my golf game and improving my home chef undertakings.

A certain satisfaction (but not the most) comes from one of my sons-in-law who is a winemaker in Sonoma and ships his own wines.” Carol Stilwell Himes (Pueblo, CO; skihimes1@comcast.net) is a docent at Rosemount Museum, a Victorian mansion in Pueblo. She’s also mentoring a girl in the eighth grade, skiing, playing golf, and hoping to start traveling soon. “Appreciating good health and the arrival of vaccines.”\n\n“About five years ago, I sold my ophthalmology practice and continued to work there part time until I retired last January,” reports David Campbell (San Diego, CA). “I loved it but always wanted to quit while I was ahead. The decision was facilitated by the birth of our first grandchild, who lives in L.A. with our daughter and her husband.” He’s also enjoyed Zooming with classmates John “Jay” Green, Sam Powers, Charlie Barer, MD ’71, and Jim Peterson.\n\nLois Thetford (Seattle, WA) reports, “My teaching in the U. of Washington School of Medicine went all online in 2020 for spring and summer, hybrid for fall. It was a hard adjustment, but we made it work. I teach in the physician assistant (PA) training program, where we have had our 54th class and trained 2,700 PAs, and I still love working with students and patients.” Most satisfaction: “Walking with my life partner, Jean Rietschel.” Biggest pandemic takeaway: “Expect the unexpected.” Jane Capellupo (W. Henrietta, NY; jacapellupo@rochester.rr.com) writes, “I cannot currently go to my gym; it’s closed. But I have been able to continue with my personal trainer at his studio.”\n\n“Although I retired from Lehigh U. four years ago,” reports Richard Weisman, PhD ’73 (Bethlehem, PA; rnw1@lehigh.edu), “I am still involved in several activities including a research project, Engineers Without Borders, and a few study abroad ventures. Study abroad has been on hold, of course. I was playing trumpet in five groups until the pandemic, and I look forward to getting back to all of them.” Carole Newman Allen (Arlington, MA; cornell@tomandcarole.org) became president of the Massachusetts Medical Society (publisher of the New England Journal of Medicine) in May. “The last time I set foot in my office there was in March 2020. Our building has been closed since then, yet we hold numerous meetings and webinars—all remote. My life consists of many Zoom sessions. In the summer I spent a lot of time in the garden at our Martha’s Vineyard home.” Carole adds, “Our younger son, Austin, his wife, Anna, and daughter Tabitha moved to Nepal last September for a two- to three-year posting with the US Foreign Service. We managed to see them and older son David ’97 (West Orange, NJ) and his husband, Michael McGrann ’96, and son Theo last August.” Satisfaction: “Communicating with family, and feeling that the MMS is making a difference helping to fight COVID and also racism.” Pandemic takeaway: “Our biggest disservice was to our nation’s children, especially those most vulnerable by race, age, disability, etc. But the pandemic also opened some doors—e.g., the use of telehealth, which will continue to enhance health and mental healthcare. We learned we can conduct business remotely, often more efficiently than before. The pandemic also exposed existing disparities.” ❖ Richard Hoffman, 2925 28th St. NW, Washington, DC 20008; email, derhoff@yahoo.com.

That means in-person Pilates and book clubs and in-home gatherings, frequently at their northern Georgia cabin. As Sara was a young grandparent, she thinks about adding “great” to that title, especially since her grandson Dylan at age 25 was married in May. Sara offers us this advice: “Well-being is a state of mind; turn off the news!” Paul Rohan (pr68@cornell.edu) lives in Westport, CT, where he was awaiting his second COVID vaccine shot to free him from the severe restrictions imposed in Connecticut. He feels there was a lot of misinformation and unnecessary restrictions imposed over the past year. Mark Belnick (mab3468@gmail.com) and his wife, Randy, live in Greenwich, CT. He’s been lecturing and teaching courses in constitutional interpretation and civil liberties at Princeton for the past 16 years. He is also a co-producer of a new musical version of the iconic Back to the Future, which played to rave reviews and SRO audiences during its trial run in Manchester, England. The show is scheduled to open this fall (COVID-permitting) in London’s West End for an open run before heading (hopefully) to Broadway.\n\nRichard Golding (goldenrl@delhi.edu) and his wife, Evelyn King, live in Mechanicville, NY.
