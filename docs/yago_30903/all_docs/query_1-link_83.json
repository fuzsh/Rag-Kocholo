        "text": "R36 From Soap Central. I didn't remember that Reva and Billy had been married, or married so long, before she and Josh first got together, but the rest of this sounds right.\n\nReva Shayne, the oldest daughter of Hawk and Sarah Shayne, grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As the daughter of the Lewis' housekeeper, Reva always felt like trash compared to the wealthy Lewis family. Though she and Josh Lewis were childhood sweethearts, they broke up when Josh went off to college, and she later married his brother, Billy, to get back at Josh. She and Billy stayed married for eight years.\n\nReva arrived in Springfield in 1983 when Alan offered her $25,000 to break up Billy's engagement to Vanessa Chamberlain. So Reva showed up with the news that she and Billy weren't officially divorced, and demanded $5 million. However, when Billy found the divorce papers, Reva realized she was cornered and gave Alan his money back.\n\nIn 1984, when Alan attacked the Lewis family, Billy talked Reva into convincing Josh to merge LTA and Lewis Oil so that they could combine power to destroy Spaulding Enterprises. It didn't take long for Reva and Josh to rekindle their passion when they returned to Cross Creek, where they had made love for the first time. Though they planned to wed, before they could make it official, Josh learned from Anita about Reva's cooperation with Alan, and bitterly left her. His father, H.B. was relieved at first, and decided to further drive Reva away from Josh by bribing Reva into marrying him.\n\nWhen Josh learned about the marriage, he was so disgusted, he went for a wild drive and crashed his car, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. He had surgery and was disheartened by the long road of physical therapy that lay ahead. While at a party at the Country Club, a drunken Phillip Spaulding was coming on to Reva. Josh thought the worst of Reva and accused her of making a play for another man. It was then, while he was wheelchair-bound, that he and Reva had the showdown to end all showdowns ... culminating in her stripping off her clothes, diving into a fountain, and baptizing herself \"The Slut of Springfield.\"\n\nAfter months of sexual tension...one rainy night, Reva climbed into Josh's bed when H.B. was not around and they made love. Later that night Billy found them and pulled her out of bed. Feeling like a loser, the scarlet woman hightailed it back home to Tulsa. While Reva was gone, Josh regained the use of his legs and tracked Reva down and begged her to run away with him. Just then, they heard from Josh's sister, Trish, that a heartsick H.B. was in failing health. The lovers returned home and gave H.B. the will to live. Shortly after, Reva discovered she was pregnant with H.B.'s baby. A heartbroken, Josh sadly told her to take good care of his \"daddy\" and left to work on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n(This was when Robert Newman left, and Reva was paired with Kyle.)\n\nI always thought it was funny that Sam Rappaport was originated on \"One Life to Live\" by Kale Browne and later on, he was replaced by his former \"Another World\" son-in-law, Kale Browne.\n\nAlso, Anna Stuart replaced Linda Dano for one episode as \"Gretel\" Rae Cummings for a few scenes that any B lister could have done or any day player. She was wasted for meatless material. That year (2002), Anna appeared on \"As the World Turns\" (as Donna, wrapping up Jake's story), \"OLTL\" and \"All My Children\" as Mary Smythe, reunited with Mark Pinter (ex-Grant, Roger Smythe). The highlight of her first week on the show was trying to integrate herself with the institutionalized Vanessa Bennett (fellow daytime diva Marj Dusay) and looked on in horror as Vanessa revealed her attempt on daughter Greenlee's life.\n\nLater on, they attempted to pair Mary with Palmer Cortlandt and they had some great scenes, but it was obvious that James Mitchell wasn't going to be able to continue on the show and Mary faded out until they brought her back for a few episodes in 2009. I'm currently enjoying her in re-runs of \"The Doctors\", having found episodes of her stint as Toni Ferra Powers, fortunately grabbing them off the web before the site was taken down.\n\nHere's some \"Anna Banana\" on \"GH\" in 1977 as Dr. Gina Dante, appearing within the first 2 minutes and later on about 9 1/2 minutes in. Tracking isn't great, but it's the only Anna/GH out there.\n\n[quote]Also, no one named you hall monitor. Our dear Aunt Liz would have that role, if anyone would.\n\nWhile I do love to tattle on people and share the good gossip I overhear about people, I have no desire to play hall monitor on this thread. And I hope I don't have to take that role since it would interfere with my eavesdropping.\n\nThat said, this is a HAPPY thread. We DION'T get into flame wars on these P&G threads. We're here to share our memories of our beloved P&G soaps. It's OK to disagree, but do it respectfully. This P&G community is a small but loyal one, so it's best to keep on good terms with all its residents. Please remember to treat others the way you want them to treat you.\n\nIt's OK to occasionally mention a non P&G soap here especially if it ties into a point you're trying to make. But if you want to have a long discussion of another soap, there are other threads for that. If you're unsure where the current thread for a particular soap is, just ask and someone will post the link.\n\nIf you need to engage in a flame war, there are hundreds of other DL threads that quickly devolve into name-calling, race-baiting and political arguments. Please take your flame wars there. Those threads are much more appropriate places if you've had a bad day and want to take your mood out on someone else.\n\nI don't recall Mark being obsessed with ratings data, but I may simply have skipped over it if he was. Usenet is the only place I ever encountered him. He was Mark with a last initial, IIRC, but I don't remember the initial. He was gay.\n\nThis was on the RATSC board, rec-arts-tv-soaps-cbs. Most of them were Y&R fans who didn't watch ATWT or GL. There was another guy named Michael who lived in Northern Virginia, I believe, who was a big WT/GL fan. He and I would rage against Mickey Against Daytime Drama when it was still the thing to do. If ruining TV shows for their fans turns out to be something God hates you for, that woman is never going to get out of hell.\n\nMichael had a cute name, but I don't remember it. It was two words, I think.\n\nI agree MADD sucked. But I think when they eliminated her role in 2004-2005 that just expedited the end of the two remaining shows.\n\nBut yes, Aunt Liz, 1993 and 1994 was the year a lot of things changed and not for the good. I think both CBS and NBC had changes in leadership that year and like many mergers, the focus was on the bottom line.\n\n1993 was the year that GL was shifted to mornings in a lot of markets - it's so weird that it happened literally as it was coming off one of its best years ever. That's when cancellation rumors started.\n\nAnd 1993-94 was when changes started happening really rapid fire at AW, too. Look at the Wikipedia page for AW and scroll near the bottom for the listings of writers and EPs. There were so many changes between Nov. 1994 and the end.\n\nThe soap discussions were what really pulled me into DL when I stumbled upon the site in 2003.\n\nBack in those days, there was just one giant thread for all the soaps. With nine soaps still on and only one thread, we filled it in 2 to 3 weeks. But lots of insider stuff shared in those threads. Several of the soap script writers posted routinely. In those days, we also didn't have to hide the thread name. It would be something blatant like \"April Soap Discussion Thread.\"\n\nUnfortunately, because there was so much insider stuff, a lot of bloggers kept linking those soap threads, which brought in the many non-gay posters. As much as we complained to the bloggers about posting links to those threads, they would merely say they were doing their job by linking in the source of the information they were reporting. And as more outsiders kept coming, fewer insiders posted here.\n\nI remember GossipGrrl well. Became good friends with her. Wish she was still posting here. Also remember HemmerHummer. There was also Jeffhamlin and denny. And a much missed Gregoriz (or something like that) who was from Cincinnati and had lots of P&G information.\n\nPS I can't tell you how wonderful it was to discuss soaps with other gay fans on these DL soap threads. Finally there were people who shared a gay perspective on soaps! It was so refreshing!\n\nNone of my friends were into soaps like I was. They might watch a few soaps, but weren't hardcore like I was. So, it wasn't until I got here that I could have those hardcore discussions with other hardcore fans. That was so important to me.\n\nEven better, those fellow hardcore fans were gay too! Great to be able to talk about how hunky various actors were. Or who was gay IRL. Or how other gay aspects were influencing what we were seeing on screen.\n\nBut the fact this entire site was for gays was so vital. So refreshing to have a messageboard to call our own!! A place to talk about things from a gay perspective! That's why a lot of us oldtimers on DL are so fiercely protective of the site and don't like when the \"fraus\" invade.\n\nBack in the day I was a member of a board where the owner (I think was Trixie? Was it Trixie's Corner or was that something else) would give us tons of blind items. She would even charge for specials. The funny thing is the BI were super fun but we never got to ever verify if they were even true. Even comings and goings ones were fuzzy enough that she could claim vindication on pretty much anything. Nevertheless I have always wanted someone to revisit old behind-the-scenes Blind Items and out them - fifteen-twenty years later, there is prescription, right?\n\nIt always amused me that it is taken at face value by mainstream press that the OJ trial was the beginning of the decline for soaps. It certainly hurt and pointed to larger shifts in television landscape but quite clear that many of the shows that later died (AW and GL as mentioned above) had started leaking a few years earlier than that. OJ trial was a convenient spin for executives who f***ed things up.\n\nr120 NBC owns Passions completely and partially owns Sunset Beach. So, it's easy enough for NBC to make the content available on its streaming service.\n\nNBC doesn't own AW or Santa Barbara. P&G owns AW and New World owns Santa Barbara (although NBC did try to get ownership of the show at one point, which is why the Dobsons were locked out of the studio). So, NBC would have to negotiate for the rights to include AW and Santa Barbara on its Peacock streaming service.\n\nAnd of course, there's also the issue of music rights. Santa Barbara used more popular music than any other soap, so those rights would be expensive. They could sub in some other less expensive songs for a lot of the popular songs, but not all of them.\n\nI can't imagine watching Santa Barbara without Peabo Bryson's \"If Ever You're in My Arms Again\" playing for Kelly and Joe's theme song, Michael Feinstein's \"My Favorite Year\" playing for CC and Sophia's love song and of course Natalie Cole's \"A Little Bit of Heaven\" playing for Cruz and Eden's love song.\n\nFingers crossed, maybe they'll find a way to make it happen with the music intact.\n\nAt one point I heard that a lot of the issues with the older soaps, such as PG is you have to convert all of that content from old videotape to a digital format which costs more money than they could get back from airing the shows. I'm not going to even pretend to know if that's true.\n\nI can understand that we're talking about thousands of episodes versus 100 or 200 episodes of a primetime series run. I can also understand the challenges that videotape presents versus film when it comes to editing and removing certain elements such as music or the transfer from videotape to digital.\n\nI know that on The Doctors they played a few very popular songs, not many, put they were hits and I'm not sure how Retro dealt with that. Maybe because the audience is so small for Retro they just hoped that no one would notice. In a few of the early rebroadcasts they left in a few of the old 60s Colgate commercials, which made it even more fun to watch.\n\nUltimately, I just don't get having all of that content sitting in a vault somewhere degrading with each passing year and not doing anything with it, especially when this new world of streaming has exploded. But, me personally, I've never thought that PG respected their soap opera history and legacy. And I'm sure the people running the company now even know or care about all of the content that just sitting around getting dusty.\n\nOJ did not have the effect on me that r132 describes. I just wanted to get back to my program, which was OLTL at the time. It was another real-life event, however, that killed OLTL, and soaps, for me in 2000: the Elian Gonzalez story.\n\nOn Good Friday, and all through Easter weekend, I had the choice of watching the Elian story unfold in all its glorious, genuine suspense—would the US government send him back to Cuba or let him stay with his Miami relatives? Or would I watch One Life? Mimi Torchin had spoiled the then-current OLTL storyline so completely in 128-point type across the cover of her ragazine that week, there was no debate: in order to know what happened next with Elian, you had to actually watch cable news that weekend.\n\nI never watched OLTL again—not seriously. I didn't really watch soaps for much longer, either. I was through with both \"World\" shows, and I would not watch another soap again until LML took over at Y&R (2005?), an interlude I loved, but that's another story.\n\nAnd then there was \"Luke is gay\" on ATWT. I took as much of that as I could stomach, and then soaps and I were done (I returned for a little of Mark Grossman as Adam Newman on Y&R, but I think I'm done with that now, too). The impeachment will have little effect on my soap watching. Y&R has killed my interest in Y&R on its own.\n\nJef/R131 No worries. I was just curious. It was interesting to me that some of the articles/columns were written under pseudonyms, but I guess in the 80s in particular someone writing about soaps might not be considered a serious journalist for other publications. This was before the era of EW, etc. where writers like Michael Logan could write about daytime AND nighttime.\n\nI remember Stephanie Sloane was the AW editor for years, of course she's now EIC. She was the subject of a lot of gossipy speculation around the time Carolyn Hinsey was fired from Soap Opera Weekly.\n\nI know, or have had some minor online chit chat, with some of the Digest writers, and a few of the writers who have written for various shows. I don't claim any inside track as I'm rarely afforded that kind of insight (or gossip) but we have chatted.\n\nI would imagine the streaming services like Hulu and Amazon would be anxious to get the content of the P&G shows, but soaps on a streaming service is unchartered territory.\n\nI mean, there's just no track record to prove large numbers of people will actually stream entire seasons of old soaps. Remember, AW got super low ratings when repeats aired on SoapNet. So far, the only soap that has entire seasons on a streaming service is Dark Shadows, but it always had a cult following.\n\nLikewise, licensing the P&G soaps could be pricey. So, I suspect Amazon or Hulu or whoever is going to wait and see how well NBC's Peacock streaming service does with the soaps it offers before making a bid on the P&G shows.\n\nAlternately, P&G could start its own streaming service. Everyone else is, so why not P&G? Except P&G has been doing everything to get out of the TV production game in recent decades save for a few special shows as discussed the Variety article linked at r202.\n\nHere's the thing. I was on Amazon Video the other and they are showing this sitcom called \"Good Morning World\". I had never heard of it, so I Googled it. It was a one season show that was on before I was born about a radio station. And I bet that most of you have never heard of that show, as well as many other old shows that are on Amazon.\n\nIf Amazon or any streaming service can put on such an obscure old show, they can put on soaps. The money in streaming is in subscriptions, not in how many views a show gets. I'm sure they love it when a show catches on fire and gets many hits and buzz, but it's not ratings driven like network TV.\n\nThe issue with most soaps is the cost of the conversion to digital and the music rights. And because most of the audio was recorded on one track, you can't replace the music. Since PG foolishly wiped the majority of their content before 1978 and before soaps started using popular music they are in this weird position with most of the catalogue.\n\nI love old soaps, but if I were on the board of directors at PG, I wouldn't vote to show soaps because the investment to get them on the air would outweigh any kind of return. And let's be honest here, we old soap fans are a niche market. We are not Dark Shadows. We are not hosting and attending annual Another World conventions. We are not spending millions on Another World DVDs.\n\nBut, if someone wants to put on an AW Convention with guest stars, I'll be the first one there.\n\nR219 Nothing on Soap Central, but I went onto Facebook and Twitter and found several articles. She was such a sweet lady, devoted to the cause of raising money for AIDS research, having lost her son to HIV related illnesses when she first joined \"Guiding Light\". I am truly saddened. She was always at the flea market in Times Square for years. I was once a member of her Yahoo fan group and got some personal responses for messages I wrote. Recently, I revisited her work as Pamela Capwell on \"Santa Barbara\", and had been a fan of hers ever since she took over the role of Myrna Clegg on \"Capitol\". It seems like a day went by where I didn't think of her in one way or another. She was very comforting to people who lost their partners or family or siblings to the disease. Her birthday would have been three weeks away.\n\nR240 I think towards the end - the last 5-10 years - she was just so frustrated that she became a bit of a diva.\n\nSome of her complaints were very valid. She saw the writing on the wall and knew the more cuts the shows made, the sooner they'd eventually disappear.\n\nI think actors like Zimmer and Grant A liked Paul Rauch, even though he could be a bit of a control freak, because he ran things with a strong hand and the actors could go to him with issues - not nonsense, but real issues - and trust he'd go to bat for them. After he left, things were a mess. Zimmer was constantly complaining about storylines.\n\nSome of her diva rep is warranted, but I also think Grant A said and did some of the same things during his time - it was part of why he was let go in 2004 - and he's never had that same \"diva\" or \"difficult\" label really stick to him. (Then again, most of his female costars went on record to praise him when he was fired.)\n\nAunt Liz here. Sorry, I haven't posted here in recent days, but this thread fell off my Watchlist, despite the fact I am the one who started the thread!.\n\nI just assumed everyone was posting on the Marj Dusay thread instead, so didn't really think much about this thread being quiet. Then today, I searched for the thread and discovered it was no longer in my Thread Watcher list on the right side of the screen. Very weird that it would just fall off like that, but it's certainly not the first thread ever to fall of of the Watchlist.\n\nTo get things back on topic, let's discuss why P&G and CBS allowed individual stations to move GL to the 10 a.m. slot beginning back in 1993.\n\nMy local station carried GL at 3 p.m. until the final episode, so I don't have any personal experience with this. But others of you may have lived through it airing at 10 a.m. I do know that the NYC station, which is owned and operated by CBS (!!!), moved it to 10 a.m. sometime in 1993.\n\nThis is so strange. Santa Barbara aired its last episode in Jan. 1993, so the only soap competition that GL had was GH, which wasn't in fantastic shape for much of 1993, at least not until Luke and Laura returned in Nov. 1993.\n\nMeanwhile, GL was in fantastic shape, coming off the strongest year it had had (1992) for a while. It faltered some by the very end of 1993, but not much. Now 1994 is a different matter -- GL declined precipitously in 1994.\n\nSo, what happened? Why did CBS start allowing individual stations to air GL at other times? What are your theories?\n\nAffiliate stations that are not owned by the network (O&Os) are contracted to carry a certain number of hours of programming from the network, but they don't have to broadcast every show the network provides or at the time they show it.\n\nFor instance when Edge was still on the official time was 4:00 est, but some ABC stations didn't carry it at all or did a delayed broadcast thing and showed it late at night or the next day in an early morning spot. My ABC station showed it at, I think, 10:30 am.\n\nNBC, non O&Os, did this quite a bit with NBC soaps in the 80s. My station moved Texas and then just stopped carrying it and The Doctors completely about a year before they both were cancelled. For a year they moved Days to the 3:00 est slot, after AW for some local talk show. Then moved it back to 1:00 the next year.\n\nIf a CBS affiliate moved GL to a morning slot in 93, I would assume that it was a delayed broadcast (typically a day behind). I believe the 2000's time shifts for GL were not day behind delayed broadcasts.\n\nMy local ABC station aired Edge of Night at 10:30 a.m. for many years. So, I was quite used to being day behind. Thus the big Friday cliffhanger always come on Mondays. You learn to adjust.\n\nOf course this was long before online messageboards where people discuss every aspect of plots. The one-day delay broadcasts would mean so many plots would be spoiled by people who saw the show in its regular time slot.\n\nOf course, for the last 30 years, we've also lived in a world where shows release detailed spoilers before shows even air. That's one of the things I believe contributed significantly to the demise of soap. Nowadays, who needs to tune in tomorrow when they can go online and read about it? And they wonder why the ratings started going down?\n\nBrent/Marion was one of the best. I know it is controversial but it really pushed the envelope. It was terrifying, campy, funny, disgusting, tragic, compelling and very well acted. You could not take your eyes off Brent/Marion when they were on screen. It was one of the few truly compelling story lines on any soap at the time. MARY!\n\nI did not mind him killing Nadine since I did not like the character and found her annoying. It was, though, never sad when he killed her and the way he killed her. I think she was expendable and a big enough character to kill for the story line to have some weight behind it.\n\nOF COURSE- GL was snake bit at the time and it ended when the fantastic actor playing him had a mental breakdown and left the role for awhile. GL really couldn't win for losing back then."
