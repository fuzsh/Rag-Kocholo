        "text": "What a pleasure it was to read this deceptively whimsical first novel from the celebrated playwright Finegan Kruckemeyer!\n\nIt begins on a sombre note, as you can see from the book description:\n\nEmma watched her mother’s kayak disappear among icebergs in the Arctic Sea. Six years later, her brother, who had not spoken since their mother was lost, warns Emma of the curse of death that she brought to anyone who looked on her face-before tragedy befalls him too.\n\nEmma consigns herself to a solitary life at sea, where she can do no more harm. After years alone, she is mysteriously drawn to land. And she docks at an island, afraid of what her arrival might mean for the welcoming man and his daughter waving from the jetty.\n\nBut who knows where our stories begin and end or how they are entwined? Who knows whether now, on the island, she begins a new tale-or takes a role in a story that began generations ago with a feast in the forest, or a chest of gold coins plunged into the sea, or an orphan in a bookshop beguiled by an elusive and troubled woman?\n\nThis is a novel unlike any other. It’s like a fairy tale told over the course of two centuries, and like those of Grimm and Perrault, it features some rough justice for evildoers. There’s also a wicked ‘stepmother’ who unwittingly provides redemption to an orphan, a stash of tainted treasure, the transformation of a ‘beast’ through the power of love, and wonderful characters who defy their destiny. And—fittingly for a book about the power of stories and storytelling—there’s a bookshop too. It sounds daft, but remarkably, it works. It’s unputdownable, and in a world of angst-ridden fiction, it’s uplifting.\n\n(Although it’s completely different, not least because it is utterly original in every way, it cheered me in the way that Rod Usher’s Poor Man’s Wealth offset the bleakness of a book I’d just read.)\n\nLike a well-constructed play, the novel is episodic, with each vivid scene linking the acts together. Chapter 1 ends with the image of Emma alone on her boat, sailing into undeserved guilt and loneliness. Chapter 2 introduces the first of the orphans: Isaac, who has fallen on hard times indeed:\n\nWhen I inherited the land, I had little.\n\nLittle to eat, little to live on and little company, little to justify my existence. I could be here or I could not, and little would it matter. Then I inherited the land.\n\nIt was a large acreage and the great-uncle Henry who’d died was an unknown figure in my life—a man who went to war and remained there, laid out on some stretch of cold ground after the others returned home. […]\n\nOver the next years, a slow succession of deaths occurred: the wife of that great uncle, some cousins—and eventually my parents too, in the depths of a season when rains are heavy and wagons are given to taking corners badly and sliding off country roads into rickety barns, which then collapse and flatten all beneath them.\n\nAt the same time—as branches of my family were being pruned by time and fate—I experienced a contraction of my own, of livelihood and love and liberty. (p.10-11).\n\nIsaac is in prison, in a penitentiary perched on a high hill, denuded of any trees that might hide an escaping prisoner. He has been there for fourteen years, tending a small garden, reading what few books were imprisoned with us, and fending off the attacks of the more volatile prisoners. What might such a man do when he inherits a parcel of land?\n\nHe turns it into a town. And then like a proper fairy tale benefactor, he holds a great feast in the forest from which he has cleared the undergrowth to form a dining room that knows no walls. And that brings the people into his small coastal town, and the tale goes on.\n\nKruckemeyer’s female characters defy stereotypes. Nella Sands, the seer, for example, has agency despite her circumstances. She is told by one doctor after another that she is not meant for children. Her husband abandons her for a woman who smoked a pipe and hung torn dresses from the tree in front of her house to scare the crows away. Like the bare hill and the penitentiary and Nella’s jar of coins, these elements turn out to be significant. It is tempting to scamper on with the story, but it’s best to take note of these things all the same. By the time Conor (another orphan) makes his appearance from the penitentiary repurposed as a home for delinquent kids, his mate Pat has come into the story via a car out the front of a motel while his mum bought speed off a pasty-looking guy inside. A car, not a wagon. The tale has skipped from one century to the next.\n\nPat is no delinquent. He’s placed there because he was only fourteen and hadn’t been to school in a long time and he didn’t have a lot of family love.\n\nBut wait, there is love… What the cops didn’t know was that the boy who had crashed the car into the building had been driving since he was six and could easily have got away…only that wouldn’t have stopped the cops heading into the room, wouldn’t have distracted them so his mum could run out of it.\n\nA part of love is sacrifice, and though the sacrifices between Pat and his mum only ever went in one direction, that didn’t make the love any the less. The more she failed, the more he loved, and it would always be that way. (p.40)\n\nDid I mention that Kruckemeyer’s award-winning plays were written for both adults and children? He knows about young people and the challenges they face.\n\nThis is a lovely book. Quietly devastating, but love and loss is like that.\n\nFinegan Kruckemeyer was born in Ireland and now lives in Adelaide. He is an award-winning playwright, whose works have been performed on six continents and in eight languages. The End and Everything Before It is his first novel.\n\nYou can find out more about the author at his website, and you can preorder the book at all good bookstores. It’s due for release in July."
