        "text": "It was either this or the Old West, and I'd much rather go underground.\n\nAlso, seeing La Sleestak in something that looks like a Dollar Tree version of a Star Wars uniform is EVERYTHING.\n\nElder Gay here. God what a shit show One Life became! Agnes wrote if off and the network de-stabilized it by making it sensational. Hiring George and Jacquie brought in millions of new viewers but I'd rather have stuck with the Vicki and Joe I knew. And Cathy should never have been made insane. Cathy Craig was a woman' s libber and I guess the idea of a lady like that made the silly housewives frown. This show as on fire from 70-76 and then it really went downhill.\n\nAnd NO ONE will ever convince me there wasn't a better Dr. Dorian Cramer than Nancy Pinkerton. No one.\n\nThe show should never have let Allan Miller leave as Dave Siegel. The Jewish DA married to the Catholic Eileen Riley. What great fights they'd have.\n\nI missed the Carla Benari story and thought Ellen Holly was lovely, but she was cleary always in the background when I watched.\n\nMichael Storm was a dream. Perfect hairy chest and he had chemistry with every actress they threw at him.\n\nI loved Marilyn Chris as Wanda. After \"my Vinny\" died, she was used for comic relief. I never understood why they made her Asa's cousin...that we kinda weird. The only time they really gave her a story is when her nephew Jason came on his motorcycle and took up with Dorian (Elaine Princi at the time). That was kinda fun. He had a sexy, long haired look. I remember the writers had Sloan Carpenter refer to Jason as having a \"girlish look.\"\n\nBut the thing is Slee played the lead role and Marilyn Chris played a supporting character. A lead should have *some* sex appeal. Slee was cast in prune commercials while in her 40s. It was painful seeing her playing Niki when she was supposed to be sexy and when she was paired up the younger, good looking Ben. Totally unbelievable coupling.\n\nWhen Dorian went through her cougar phase, it was believable. Both Robin Strasser and Elaine Princi didn't look ridiculous when bedding younger men Jason and Joey.\n\nI thought Jason was an interesting character. Mark Brettschneider wasn't your typical soap hunk, but was sexy in his own way. He wasn't that experienced as an actor, but he did have some talent too.\n\nKen Meeker \"Rafe\" was one of my dreamboats. When I was 19 I spotted him (for all of several seconds) as I walked past a limo he was in. This was on a Friday night in late December of '81. I could only see him from the chest and up but I got a nice glimpse of him smiling or looking happy as he chatted with a couple of the friends he was with. One passenger was a female and they looked to be decked out in gala attire.\n\nR131: I found Karen Witter more than acceptable and actually prettier than Andrea Evans. But then I only started watching OLTL in 1989 and the bulk of my watching was the early 90s (I quit watching around the time Megan died). So Witter was more \"my Tina.\" Then they replaced her with some anorexic bottle blond and I lost interest in the character.\n\nGabrielle gave me LIFE! By far the best thing about the show, with the exception of Cord's bulge.\n\nAnd am I just imagining/misremembering this or was the original Blair Daimler Asian?\n\n[quote]Do you accept anyone other than Andrea Evans Tina?\n\nI detested Andrea Evans' Tina. A friend was a big OLTL/GH fan, and we worked together for awhile in an environment where he could watch his stories, and everyone around him HAD to watch his stories. Ugh. It was what convinced me the ABC soaps were for dumb children. Especially Andrea Evans.\n\nI picked it up on my own several years later because of (1) Billy Douglas and (2) Douglas Marland's death. I liked whoever was playing Tina then. She made sure all the kids had ice cream right after Meghan died, and it had been a tradition among my friends to eat a pint of H-D whenever one of our friends died. I think it was Karen Witter, but I'm not sure.\n\nI know that Robert S. Woods and HBS had a falling out at some point in the 90's, and that he didn't want to be paired with her anymore. This was around the time of JFP as producer, and that is why Bo and Nora were split. RSW also resisted a reunion for a long time, which is why the show had Bo \"play the field\" with so many women in the years follwing that. But with the show in decline towards the end, he finally agreed to be paired with HBS again.\n\nThe only thing I remember about OLTL is how ABC gave Jacquie Courtney whatever she wanted. If JC asked for it, she got it. The perks in her contract were very nice. JC ran that set, until they hired Paul Rauch who wouldn't take the job unless JC was fired before he got there. I always thought it was strange that they would fire the star of the show for a producer. Rauch was a good producer, but there were other good producers out there at the time. Slezak completely owes her rise on that show to Rauch.\n\nIf Rauch would not have been hired, JC would have remained on the show and you just have to wonder what that would have meant for Slezak. Funny how things work out.\n\nThe Julia Barr situation was a travesty. It was just cruel. Frons had a target on David Canary's back too, but McTavish and Agnes intervened. They should've done the same for Barr, who IMO was more valuable to the show. Regarding HBS, she said at the time that, given how little story she had and that the over-40 women on the other ABC were being canned right and left, she was literally shocked that her contract was renewed. I wonder what went on behind the scenes to keep her with the show, because at one point it looked like she about out the door.\n\nI would really like to know the story behind Gabrielle's death. If you listened to Malone, he liked writing for Gabrielle and originally had big plans for Bo/Gabrielle/Nora/Max when he first came back in 2003. I wonder if the killing was a mandate or \"punishment\"? Didn't Fiona speak out about NM/JdP's firing?\n\nDan Gauthier was also let go not long after he said something about the writing. And we know what happened to Dixie when Cady McClain spoke out.\n\n[quote] Mimi did what the shows asked her to do. They were in a post OJ panic. Blaming one editor is kind of unfair.\n\nThe blaring in 128 pt type \"WILL RAPPAPORT ESCAPES TRAIN TO STATESVILLE PRISON!!!\" was no one's doing but Mimi Torchin's. I never needed to watch OLTL again. Her rag took total story control. The shows were secondary.\n\nI didn't watch another soap for about five years, when I happened upon Kevin Fisher getting the shit beat out of him in jail on Y&R one day in 2005. I never returned to OLTL.\n\n[quote]Harding LeMay was a consultant on OLTL? Have I been living in a bunker? What years was he their consultant? Why not just hire him as HW instead?\n\nIt was the early JFP period. R250 seems to know the exact specifics better than I do. It was the reason I watched again. He called her \"the best EP I have ever worked with\" at some point. I don't think he wanted the time commitment that being a full-time HW would have meant.\n\nR269 not entirely true, Frons was head of NBC Daytime in the early to mid 80s and was hell-bent on making DAYS, General Hospital 2.0 , it seems Frons always had a hard on for GH, he hired firmer GH headwriter Pat Falken Smith and had her create anither Cassadine type family on Days with the infamous Dimera's, and the Brady's were DAYS answer to the blue collar Spencer's, he also pushed the action/adventure supercouple aspect of DAYS and like GH peppered the show with wild sci fi plots\n\nHe also told everyone at DAYS that NO ONE over the age of 35 will be involved in a major storyline and that most will be dropped to recurring statusas he wanted to focus on the young couple's like Kristian Alphonso's Hope, whom Frons personally discovered in New York City and cast her on DAYS, and Bo.\n\nSusan Seaforth Hayes, who was on the early years of GH in the 60s and recently celebrated her 50th anniversary, since 1968 on DAYS HATED Frons and he wanted her to go recurrin because she was too old to be in a major storyline, she refused and quit the show in 1984 with her husband Bill Hayes\n\nR275 when he was in charge of NBC Daytime in the 80s, he focused solely on YOUNG supercouples and sci find on DAYS\n\nPeople credit James Reilly, who Incidentally came up on the ABC soaps as a writer on All My Children, Ryan's Hope and breakdown writer on General Hospital, for making DAYS ridiculous and campy beyond belief in the 90s, demonic possession anyone, but DAYS was already headed towards that direction in the 80s under FRONS directive, they had robots, the Dimera's secret island with booby traps and quicksand, and supercouples like Bo and Hope saving the world from Stafano Dimera and his \"magic prisms\" that he plotted to control the world with\n\nThe problems DAYS has now can be directly back to his Frons wanted the show written in the 80s, all fluff and camp and unrealistic sci find storylines. People tend to forget back in the 70s DAYS was considered a very classy, prestige , realistic soap, Agnes Nixon used to watch it everyday according to a People magazine interview with her, that dealt with social issues, interracial dating, crib death, lesbianism etc, not the campfest it is now.\n\nRon Carlivati just posted a photo of him and Susan Lucci that was taken a few days ago. Everyone thinks he's gonna bring her to DAYS and all the soap fraus on Twitter have come to the conclusion she'll be playing Erica Kane on DAYS and not a new character. Don't these fraus know that she can't play Erica since ABC OWNS the character.\n\nAlso Linda Dani, Rae from OLTL, has just acted in her fer project in years a Hallmark movie starring Alison Sweeney, Sami Brady on DAYS and occasional episode director on General Hospital (Frank Valentini and Ron Carlivati LOVE her), and Cameron Matheson (Ryan from All My Children) as Sweeney's love interest\n\nr271 Your timeline is off regarding Brian Frons and Days.\n\nFrons became head of NBC Daytime in March 1983. Immediately prior to that, he had been head of CBS Daytime for about 5 years.\n\nPat Falken Smith returned to Days as HW in fall 1981, but was gone by summer 1982 due to a contract dispute. Falken Smith had been HW of GH during the 1980 Luke and Laura love-on-the-run storyline and wrote the beginning of the Ice Princess storyline.\n\nIt Falken Smith who began morphing Days into GH 2.0. It started with the casting of Thaao Penghlis as Tony DiMera in fall 1981. Thaao was fresh off his stint as Victor Cassadine on GH, so it was natural way to begin the transformation.\n\nThings accelerated when Stefano DiMera arrived in Salem in Feb 1982. Stefano was clearly modeled after Mikos Cassadine except without the weather machine or plans for world domination.\n\nAs for the working class Brady family, Roman first appeared in Dec. 1981, followed soon after by Kayla. Bo arrived in Salem until April 1983. About that same time, the Brady parents, Shawn and Caroline showed up. Frank Parker played Shawn, a role almost identical to his GH role of Paddy Kelly who ran Kelly's Diner with his wife Rose.\n\nSo, by the time Frons arrived at NBC in March 1983, the Days transformation was already well underway. But since the ratings were on the rise, Frons obviously encouraged the show to continue to become GH 2.0.\n\nAnd yes, it was Frons who insisted the show focus on younger characters, especially Bo and Hope, at the expense of the older characters, especially Doug and Julie.\n\nI do but even more wars were going on at Media Domain. OMG, I couldn't believe people would be so vicious over a soap or any fictional story. Then there was this racist pro Blair/Todd & Blair board with the craziest posters you could imagine. I would bet that all of them still alive are 100% Trump supporters these days.\n\nThe best soap board was right here in the then separate DL soap board. We had several people connected to OLTL and amazingly in the know. They gave spoilers and scoops that always turned out to be true. There was no doubt they were insiders. No other board on the Internet could touch DL's. Those were the days.\n\nI don't think Rauch's demand was that Holly be fired. According to her, he was extremely critical of her voice and wanted her to get voice lessons. She even appeared for a while, as did Lil, in the new Peebo Bryson intro. I think eventually he just decided to cut his losses with her, but I don't think she was immediately on his radar to axe. He did put Slee front and center after really not having much to do besides be a talk-to character.\n\nI don't think any soap opera would have made the son of a main character gay back in those days. I used to argue that Todd should have been Kevin Buchanan, but I guess the writers back then were reluctant to take the son of a main character down such a dark path.\n\nBut it would have been interesting to give Vicki sons who were not the typical sons for a soap opera matriarch.\n\n[quote] Phillippe was never going to play Joey.\n\nTrue, but the original story was that Joey would come out as gay. They didn't pursue it then - ABC was nervous about that in the early 90s. They were more comfortable with it by the time AMC did its story, of course.\n\nJoey and Kevin's mistreatment as characters was part of the death by a hundred cuts for OLTL. Shows got so ashamed of having a past older than 5 seconds that they jettisoned that past, and most of the viewers with them.\n\nr414, I am looking at this from the perspective of the show in 1992, not the show as it would be two years later in 1994. My crystal ball was at the cleaners. Now, if there's [italic]history[/italic] I should have considered before stating my desire that the show stick to its original \"gay Joey\" plan early in 1992, that's one thing. But for you to expect me to retcon my thinking and anticipate the unanticipatable, well, as I said, my crystal ball was at the cleaners in 1992.\n\nWhile I don't care either way, I find this to be a fascinating discussion. You could have made Joey gay and he still could have had a fling with Dorian. They could have played the confused angle and Dorian was trying to \"help\" Joey figure things out. Dorian could have manipulated Joey into something. Soap gays are always falling into pussy. There are ton of ways to get to the same endgame.\n\nYou could have also played it that Joey was confiding in Dorian about being gay and Viki misread the situation and assumed they were sleeping together and Dorian just didn't do anything set Viki straight. Any writer worth a damn would could figure out a million ways to get to the trigger that set Viki off. And most soap writers have a B story ready to go because many A stories get rejected.\n\nWell, I'm sorry that I've offended you R421. But if you're offended by gay men sleeping with women on soaps, then you've taken dumps in front of studies all over New York and LA.\n\nJackie Courtney was gorgeous with a wonderful voice-\n\nIt always surprises me the extreme mixed views from those who worked with her-\n\nIt appears that she had no issues getting along with women, and that it was mostly men in charge who were not fans of hers.\n\nFrom what I have seen on Youtube she was quite a good actress.\n\nR441, I was just thinking I should have mentioned that after typing my post!\n\nRobin looked gorgeous- I liked her opinion on Dorian's personality as well. I liked Joe Stuart asking her to expand on her answer (it was impressive)\n\nI cannot believe that was filmed basically my entire life ago. I was 3! Time is an odd thing.\n\nIts very sad to me that Courtney lost her life due to a melanoma on her face. She appeared to take very good scare of her skin and in all the videos I have seen of her, she never looked like a sun worshiper.\n\nR448, and that is why I find it interesting that it was pretty much men who did not like Jackie....\n\nMight she have had a bitchy quality in real life? Possibly? I cannot remember anything like that in Lemay's book. He thought the she was a one note actress. Was her and that Reinholdt's behavior bad behind the scenes? My memory tells me it was just Reindholdt (sp)\n\n[quote] From what I have seen on Youtube she was quite a good actress.\n\nJacqueline Courtney was not a really varied actress. She DID have a presence, undeniably so. She had the sort of wounded ingenue bit down perfectly, to the point that the audience would deeply root for her.\n\nBut she was not capable of really performing anything more complex. The scenes where Rachel comes to get Steve's house back, and Alice flips out, are embarrassing.\n\nIn an old school soap there was a place for that kind of performance. But the newer, more psychologically driven shows required more. Ironically, the shows have all regressed to the point where those kind of unadorned performances are popular again. Had she lived, she could have become the new Kay Chancellor type at some show, who knows.\n\nWow...I can't believe even Susan Batten seems to have remained close with Kassie and Jim.\n\nI have always heard Kassie was one of the nice ones. JdP, OTOH, could be a cunt at times which I think he even admitted in retrospect.\n\nI always found it interesting that Laura Koffman did not seem to stay that much in contact with the people she worked closely with - even now, Kassie/Gina/Robin and Kristen Alderson seem to get together regularly.\n\n\"In early December 2016, DePaiva went into the hospital with a neutropenic fever. “I was in the hospital for 10 days with strep in my blood in December, and that completely set me back because that’s the only time I thought, ‘Oh, my gosh, I really might die,’ ” she reveals. “I was scared, because they didn’t know what was causing the fevers, and I was delusional for five or six days until they found out that it was strep and got me on the proper antibiotic. When I got out of the hospital, on the 23rd of December, JQ had started his Christmas break and gotten a ride to our mountain house. It was really late, and I was very weak. We got up to the house and we have a barn that we converted into a giant party room. Jimmy said to me, ‘I think JQ’s up at the barn, you wanna go in and see him?’ And I’m going, ‘Oh, I’m so tired, can I just walk to the house?’ He goes, ‘Why don’t you just go up and say hello to JQ?’ I walked in and there’s Christmas music playing and I walked to the second floor, and JQ had decorated the barn. He went and bought a Christmas tree, decorated it, he cut snowflakes out of butcher paper. I sobbed. I just sobbed. That was really, really sweet. I just went, ‘Oh, my gosh, what an angel.’\n\n*sobbing*\n\n*bawling*\n\nMARY!\n\nMARY!\n\nMARY!\n\nIt just dawned on me that we have 3 trolls who bring the OLTL threads to a dead halt-\n\n1-Kathy Glass Troll\n\n2-Liliane Hayman/Tercel Troll\n\n3-Mimi Torchin Troll\n\nI enjoy the first two at times when I am in the mood, but the Mimi Torchin Troll is a bore.\n\nTwo things ended this show-\n\n1)O.J. Simpson\n\n2)ABC wanted out of the soap business. We can blame Front, but someone had to have the job- And it was him.\n\nSlee's 1996 win is uncomfortable to watch because you can tell nobody in Radio City that night is rooting for her and she comes to the stage with minimal applause. And then there is a shot of a deflated Lucci who looks utterly furious inside... the whole thing just feels negative. It wasn't fair that Slezak kept winning year after year after year and this has nothing to do with Lucci, but more to do with the fact that great lead actresses of the genre never got any recognition.\n\nI always thought Lucci took mostly from Julie Olson on Days of Our Lives, the melodramatic scheming teenage dreamer who wanted to make a better life and went after her best friends man and who had big issues with her parents\n\nWhen DAYS premiered in 1965, Julie was the first modern and realistic teenager on the soaps, also in a 1975 People magazine profile, Agnes Nixon admitted to watching DAYS everyday to \"keep up with the competition and because it's a really good show\", Bill Bell was DAYS headwriter at the time\n\nThe Rachel from AW influence is there too in early Erica, but Nixon was involved in the early years of AW so again, a connection\n\nAgnes Nixon wrote the bible for All My Children in the 60s, but couldn't sell it to a network, so she put it away. She was hired to be the headwriter of Another World and used story from her AMC bible on that show. While Rachel showed up on screen first, Erica was actually created first. Erica and Rachel are basically the same character with similar backstories. Julie was a troubled teen, but different from both Erica and Rachel. Erica and Rachel were maneaters from day 1 and both wanted better lives in Hollywood. Julie had different motivations.\n\nAs R534 notes, All My Children's bible was actually the basis for Rachel on AW. Agnes was hired there in late 1965. She'd submitted AMC's bible to P&G and I believe CBS was going to air it, but passed at the last minute.\n\nShe used some of the story ideas re: Erica for Rachel. Meanwhile, she lost the AMC bible- she thought she'd lost it on a vacation - and when ABC hired her away to create a show, she created One Life to Live. It was only after she'd turned that into the network and it was airing that they asked her if she'd create another show, and she found the AMC bible.\n\nYou can see the obvious parallels between Ada/Rachel and Mona/Erica. Supposedly, a young Susan Lucci was told before starting on AMC to watch Strasser on AW as \"training\" so if Robin has issues with her, they're kind of merited, to be honest.\n\nR538 and Louise quit Santa Barbara in 1986 to move to NYC for her role as Judith Sanders on One Life to Live, even dating and living with Paul Rauch at the time\n\nAfter the break up she moved back to LA and returned to SB and then her defining role as Vivian Alamain on DAYS\n\nRobin Strasser is one of Louise's best friends and rumors swirled last year that Robin was coming to DAYS as the adopted mother of Stefan O (Tyler Christopher).\n\nFor those who are saying the Emmys are not a sport, so it is not a competition?\n\n[quote] After Oprah won 18 Daytime Emmys (for best show and best host), she stopped submitting her name for consideration.\n\nNot true - Oprah only took herself out of the running when she received the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 (she still submitted that year, trying with Rosie O'Donnell) - After that she said since she won the Lifetime Achievement Award, she saw no point in submitting - HOWEVER she still allowed the show to submit in other categories - Just not Best Show or Best Talk Show Host\n\nErika Slezak only submitted when she felt she had the material - as someone pointed out, it could have been someone else who won if Slezak wasn't around - and other actresses did win over Susan when Slezak wasn't in contention.\n\n[quote] Slee's lucky Andrea Evans left when she did because Andrea and Fiona Hutchison were positioned as the show's leading performers by 1990. Slezak would have been relegated to the supporting function her mediocrity deserved: because the woman never had star power. That's why they had to invent alternate personalities, in a hopeless attempt to make her interesting on screen.\n\nErika Slezak would be fine with it, because at the end of the day the less time she spent at the studio the better. She liked acting, and brought home the bacon but she really wanted to be a full-time mom. So her idea situation would be to work two days a week and only have one line. If she had that should would still be the happiest person in the world.\n\nSlezak was the show's leading lady by default. Let's be honest, if Rauch wouldn't have demanded JC be fired, JC would have remained the star for the rest of the show.\n\nAs for Slezak's Emmys. She did some good work and was a known as a good actress. So when the panels were going over the reels, they probably glossed over the few instances of hammy stuff and the scenery chewing because she was a proven performer. Basically a Slezak reel got extra credits points just for being in the batch which meant some other deserving actress' reel didn't get the attention it really deserved.\n\nWhy are you coming for me R576? I acknowledged that Slezak is a good actress. All I was saying is that these people don't have time to watch the other shows, so they would see a reel from someone like Slezak, a proven quality performer, and just move that to the top of the pile because it was a Slezak reel. Which means that some other reel, may not get the same attention or careful consideration which put them at a disadvantage. We've heard the stories about the judging panels and how they operate.\n\nDo you really think Lucci was getting nominated every year because of her excellent work. No. She was nominated because of the PR aspects of her nomination, which meant that some other deserving actress missed a slot.\n\nI'm not a Slee hater, but I'm not infatuated with her, I found her acting to be a bit much at times, and I think the snobs that believe she's in another stratosphere from Lucci are deluded. Having said that, she was under no obligation to remove herself from the Emmy awards, and good for her for racking up as many as she could."
