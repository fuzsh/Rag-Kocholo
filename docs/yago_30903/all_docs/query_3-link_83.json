        "text": "Holland Taylor was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the third-born (and last) daughter of her mother, Virginia (Davis), a painter, and the only child of her father, C. Tracy Taylor, an attorney. She spent her teen years in nearby Allentown, PA, where Holland got the nickname, \"Penny Taylor\" because of her coppery hair color. Holland attended Quaker schools, then majored in drama at Bennington College. At the age of 22 Holland moved to New York with the desire to become a \"great big Broadway star.\" After fifteen years of \"disappointments and near misses\" in New York and California, Holland was cast as Ruth Dunbar in the sitcom Bosom Buddies (1980) with Tom Hanks. It was Holland's \"breakout\" role and it led to many other TV and film offers including the movie Auf der Jagd nach dem grünen Diamanten (1984) as Kathleen Turner's book publisher and friend. Holland had hesitated to accept the role but her acting coach and mentor Stella Adler encouraged her not to be so \"stage minded.\" In 1992 Holland was still living in Greenwich Village, New York and traveling back and forth between a rented apartment in Hollywood and New York in order to work on both coasts. Holland has said her first love was the theater but the work for her in TV and films was better. However, by 1992, Holland said she was dealing with traveling back and forth \"less and less well\". Over the next few years, Holland moved to California full-time. In the last couple of years, she gave up her apartment in West Hollywood for her own home in the Hollywood Hills. Holland won an Emmy in 1999 for her work in Practice: Die Anwälte (1997).\n\nWill Sasso was born in Ladner, British Columbia (a suburb of Vancouver), to a family of Italian descent. He grew up respecting comedy of all styles, thanks in part to an unhealthy relationship with the family television that began when Will was around two or three. With his mind consequently bent, Sasso decided at an early age to become an actor. At the age of fifteen, he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from Vancouver to Los Angeles, Sasso starred for five seasons as the quirky teen, \"Derek Wakaluk\" on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series Madison (1993) allowing him to hone his acting and improvisational skills as well as providing him with enough money to buy a television of his own.\n\nWill starred for five seasons on FOX's hit sketch comedy series MADtv (1995) giving TV viewers a reason to stay up late with characters like the accident-prone handyman \"Paul Timberman\" and offbeat impressions of Bill Clinton, Kenny Rogers, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Seagal and Randy Newman. After a successful tenure with the show beginning in 1997, Sasso decided to leave the late-night staple in 2002, eager to explore the next stage of his career.\n\nMoviegoers know Sasso from his roles in more than twenty-five feature films including Best in Show (2000), directed by Christopher Guest, Gnadenlos schön (1999), Beverly Hills Ninja - Die Kampfwurst (1997) starring the late Chris Farley, and Hot Chick - Verrückte Hühner (2002) starring Rob Schneider and produced by Adam Sandler, with whom Sasso previously worked on Happy Gilmore - Ein Champ zum Verlieben (1996).\n\nMore recently, Sasso can be seen every week as \"Carl Monari\" on the ABC sitcom Office Girl (2002).\n\nIf \"born to the theater\" has meaning in determining a person's life path, then John Lithgow is a prime example of this truth. He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John's father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations.\n\nJohn moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in Garp und wie er die Welt sah (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Zeit der Zärtlichkeit (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series Hinterm Mond gleich links (1996).\n\nThis production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.\n\nVeteran actress Christine Estabrook has built an impressive portfolio of roles in film, television, and theater.\n\nBorn and raised in East Aurora, near Buffalo, New York, Estabrook was one of five children raised by a single mother. She worked her way through school at various jobs, including a stint at the very first Fisher-Price toy factory making toys by hand. After graduating from the prestigious Yale School of Drama (among her classmates was Meryl Streep), she moved to New York to pursue an acting career.\n\nShe quickly made her mark in the theater, starring in Broadway productions of The Sisters Rosenzweig, The Heidi Chronicles, I'm Not Rappaport, The Inspector General, and The Cherry Orchard. She won a Drama Desk Award for the Off-Broadway production of The Boys Next Door, an Obie Award for her role in Pastorale, and a Drama Desk Award nomination for her performance in North Shore Fish.\n\nEstabrook's credits also include numerous regional theater productions, and four years working in the Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference. After 17 years of performing on stage, Estabrook decided she was ready for new challenges and moved to Los Angeles, eager to work in a different medium.\n\nSince then, she has guest-starred on some of television's most popular shows and appeared in many feature films.\n\nThe role of Mrs. Huber on Desperate Housewives (2004) was written especially for the actress by the series' creator, Marc Cherry."
