        "text": "I am generally fairly callous about abandoning books if I find them unimpressive but I had such high hopes for these two that I persevered until the very end, unwilling to abandon all hope. Sometimes patience is not rewarded.\n\nRed Sauce Brown Sauce by Felicity Cloake (2022) – I adore One More Croissant for the Road, Cloake’s foodie travel book about cycling around France and enjoying local dishes. What better pastime for a food writer! And Britain, though hardly a culinary competitor to France, certainly could have offered up an interesting array of meals – but sadly Cloake focuses her regional travels through the British Isles on just one meal: breakfast. While there is some regional variance (laverbread in Wales, porridge in Scotland), it’s really not enough to carry an entire book and whereas Cloake was delightful in her excitement over the ever-changing French scenery, injuries that limit her cycling adventures, Covid restrictions, and perhaps over familiarity make her less descriptive when it comes to her native land. Too much time is devoted to talking about the friends and family who host her along the way, which is a very nice way to thank them but not of interest to most of the readers who are looking for a food- or travel-focused book. Even the title is a weak framing device, as neither the author nor many of the people she encounters like either ketchup or brown sauce with their breakfast. I hope Cloake cycles off towards more varied cuisine sometime soon.\n\nShards of Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold (1986) – I have heard rave reviews for years about the Vorkosigan Saga; the books have been nominated for countless prizes and won many of them, and the diverse cast of characters is deeply beloved by many readers. It had been a while since I last read any proper science fiction so I picked this up hoping to be starting a new and exciting series.\n\nThe concept is certainly appealing: Commander Cordelia Naismith finds herself stranded on an unpopulated planet with an injured comrade and Lord Aral Vorkosigan, an infamous soldier from the powerful and deeply political planet of Barrayar. After a few days trekking to find help, there is a clear attraction between Cordelia and Vorkosigan but interplanetary politics are vicious and Cordelia is soon fleeing for home. Of course, their paths cross again (as they must, given that they are the parents of the series’ main hero) but the politics never become less messy.\n\nI was reminded almost immediately after starting of why I’ve never had success with Bujold before: dialogue. There were other things I didn’t like – the pacing was too fast, the twists and plots that were supposed to be clever were overused – but in the end it was the dialogue that killed this for me. Cordelia is meant to be an intelligent, capable, mature woman, but slips into vapid slang at the most inopportune moments. Every time it happened, I was jolted out of the scene by my frustration. There is an inadvertently hilarious scene when Vorkosigan is somberly telling her of the evil that surrounds them, the weight of the subject making him quieter and quieter as he eloquently goes on about the perfidy of man. To which she responds, like a complete idiot: “Commodore Vorkosigan – Aral – what’s eating you? You’re so keyed up I expect you to start pacing the ceiling any minute.” Jesus wept.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAfter slacking off a bit with my non-fiction reading earlier in the year, May saw me stepping up my game (also receiving a number of much-anticipated library holds – truly the deciding factor when it comes to what I read) with seven non-fiction titles. But it was still balanced by many, many rom-coms.\n\nThe No-Show by Beth O’Leary (2022) – Three women are stood up by Joseph Carter on Valentine’s Day: Siobhan, who enjoys their hotel hook-ups when she’s visiting from Dublin; Jane, who Jospeh had promised to partner as a fake date for an event she dreaded; and Miranda, his girlfriend. None gets a straight answer as to why she was stood up and so their doubts begin to grow.\n\nO’Leary treads a line here between slick and smart and I’m still not entirely sure which I think she pulls off but it’s fundamentally a fun book, even if Joseph remains a (necessarily) distant figure throughout and therefore not an ideal romantic hero.\n\nFree by Lea Ypi (2021) – a wonderful memoir about growing up in Albania in the dying years of communism and in the desperate 1990s. Ypi provides an interesting glimpse into a country I know little about and her memories of helped me understand all the modern stereotypes I’ve absorbed – of gangsters trafficking people across the Adriatic and illegal workers in Italy – and how they came to be. A good country to leave, sadly.\n\nThe Authority Gap by Mary Ann Sieghart (2021) – the subtitle for Sieghart’s entertaining and enraging book is “Why Women Are Still Taken Less Serious Than Men, and What We Can Do About It”, but it’s hard to get excited about the (very practical) actions she outlines when you realise just how many of them there are. I suspect there won’t be many surprises here for most women, especially those in the corporate world, but it’s helpful to have the facts. A book you’ll want to make every man in your office read (but will they take it seriously?).\n\nOne More Croissant for the Road by Felicity Cloake (2019) – Reread. A joyous foodie memoir about Cloake’s bicycle journey through France to explore regional specialties.\n\nGoblin Hill by Essie Summers (1977) – After Faith’s parents die, she discovers she was adopted with only just enough time to reconnect with her dying birth mother. Now knowing the identify of her birth father, she looks for a job near his New Zealand farm until she can work up the courage to present herself. She starts work as a family historian only to discover that the women who have hired her are her great-aunts. Soon she is caught up in the family (especially with Gareth Morgan, her stepbrother) while waiting for her father to return from his travels. There are many silly secrets and the overall effect is classic Summers but far from her best.\n\nThe Wedding Crasher by Abigail Mann (2022) – an enjoyably slow-moving romcom about a woman who finds herself swept up into the wedding chaos of her university housemate years after last seeing him. It’s a bizarrely complicated set up but Mann makes it work with fundamentally relatable characters. This is her third novel and I’ve enjoyed all of them.\n\nTwelve Days in May by Niamh Hargan (2022) – jumping from one novel about two university friends contemplating what-might-have-been, I fell straight into another. I guess we know what people were musing about during Covid lockdowns.\n\nTwelve years after meeting in Bordeaux, Lizzy and Ciaran reconnect at the Cannes film festival where his film is debuting and she is working for the Scottish Film Board. With allegations of plagiarism against Ciaran, his PR team pulls her in to the media whirlwind to attest to the originality of the film, based on their Erasmus experience. But the film – and being together – brings back memories of their intense friendship all those years before and its abrupt ending. Soon Lizzy is wondering how well she really remembers what happened and if there is a chance to start again. Thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nUnder One Roof by Ali Hazelwood (2022) – Hazelwood has a trio of linked novellas that have come out before her second novel is released in August. They’ve been released first as audiobooks and I did listen to the other two but this was the only one I read. About three friends in STEM fields, I honestly found all the characters very annoying and the romances frustrating, though this one – about two unwilling housemates who eventually fall in love – was…the least frustrating? Faint praise, indeed.\n\nThe Temporary European by Cameron Hewitt (2022) – For North American travellers, Rick Steves is a dependable and practical travel guru, inspiring others with his passion for European travel. Cameron Hewitt is his right-hand man and equally excited about sharing his love of Europe. I’ve loved reading his blog posts over the years, especially since his main area of focus is Central and Eastern Europe, so it’s no surprise I loved this collection of travel essays. Like Rick, Cameron is funny, generally optimistic, and candid about his likes and dislikes.\n\nBook Lovers by Emily Henry (2022) – when literary agent Nora’s sister insists they take a holiday together to a small town in North Carolina, Nora can’t refuse. Ever since their single-parent mother died twelve years before (and even before that), Nora has felt responsible for Libby’s happiness. Seeing how harried Libby is now – pregnant and with two young daughters already – Nora goes along with the plan. She’s less willing to go along with Libby’s romance-novel-esque list of things to do while there (ride a horse, go skinny dipping, date a local). But when Nora finds a familiar face in the small town – Charlie, an editor she’s crossed paths with in New York – things begin to look up.\n\nHenry is very, very, very good at romcoms and this may be her best so far. Nora is the anti-Hallmark heroine. She feels cast as the evil urban ice queen, whose boyfriends go on business trips to quirky small towns and find love with peppy girls trying to save their family companies. When she finds herself in a small town…that does not change. And I loved that. Nora gets to be who she is throughout – a successful, competent, in-control woman. And she gets a successful, competent, in-control love interest who doesn’t need to challenge or change her, just be there for her to rely on and let her feel comfortable enough to relax a little. Truly, the dream.\n\nWe Don’t Know Ourselves by Fintan O’Toole (2022) – a superb blend of history and memoir in which journalist O’Toole looks at the changes in modern Ireland over the course of his life, from his birth in 1958 to the present day. Reviewed here.\n\nBorders by Thomas King (2021) – a graphic novel adaptation of an old short story by King about a boy and his mother trying to cross the Canada-US border. When his mother is unwilling to identify her nationality as anything other than Blackfoot (whose lands straddle the border), the boy and his mother find themselves stuck in a no man’s land at the border crossing.\n\nThe Meet Cute Method by Portia MacIntosh (2022) – Still enjoying my discovery of MacIntosh’s romcoms.\n\nVinegar Girl by Anne Tyler (2016) – Reread of Tyler’s retelling of The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nAfter the Romanovs by Helen Rappaport (2022) – another fascinating history from the always reliable Rappaport about the Russians who found their way to Paris both during the early years of the 20th Century and after the revolution. Reviewed here.\n\nA White Bird Flying by Bess Streeter Aldrich (1931) – excellent sequel to A Lantern in Her Hand from the perspective of Abby Deal’s granddaughter Laura. Laura is determined to fulfil the genteel aspirations her grandmother never achieved but, ultimately, like Abby she finds herself tempted by love and the promise of friendship and a family. Aldrich poignantly tracks the decline of the first generation of pioneers and reflects on how quickly the country has changed, that the grandchildren of those early settlers now take going to college for granted and have the whole world at their feet.\n\nNew Zealand Inheritance by Essie Summers (1957) – this was Summers’ first book and she certainly began as she meant to go on. Roberta returns to her grandfather’s Otago farm in her mid-twenties, after travelling the world with her artistic parents and nursing them through their final years. Now she is looking for roots and feels drawn back to Heatherleigh, where she spent one idyllic summer as a child. When she arrives, it seems as though her grandfather’s one-time shepherd and now neighbour, Muir Buchanan, is paying her attentions with an eye to her inheritance. Roberta, fighting her attraction, decides to lead him on a merry dance.\n\nRoberta is the worst kind of heroine: a sensible person doing absolutely bonkers things to serve the plot. And Muir is uselessly uncommunicative and struggling a bit with the chip on his shoulder. Backed up by some absurdly melodramatic stories for secondary characters, it’s all a bit much.\n\nHow We Met by Huma Qureshi (2021) – a short, gentle memoir about Qureshi’s experiences growing up in a family and culture that shaped her approach to finding a romantic partner – and how she eventually chose a different path and a very different sort of husband.\n\nHolding Her Breath by Eimear Ryan (2022) – I loved the writing in this story of a young woman starting a new life at university in Dublin, growing away from the swimming that defined her teen years and delving into her family’s past and the suicide of her famous poet grandfather. But…there are too many buts to count. The plot and characterization are bog standard and I’m sure I’ll forget everything within a month or two.\n\nSee You Yesterday by Rachel Lynn Solomon (2022) – Extremely good YA novel about two university freshmen who find themselves stuck – à la Groundhog Day – reliving the same day over and over. When they realise it’s happening to them both, they band together and start trying to break out of the loop and move forward with their lives. As days turn to weeks, they have time to get to know one another, go a little loopy, work through some issues, and, very sweetly, fall in love. It’s all delightful, funny, and poignant, and the characters, both dealing with baggage they don’t particularly want to confront, are highly relatable (if a little too emotionally evolved for eighteen year olds).\n\nRead Full Post »"
