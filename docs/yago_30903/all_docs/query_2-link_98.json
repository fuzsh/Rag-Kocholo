        "text": "Click Here For A Link to Old Laurelton Photos\n\nClick Here For A Photo of P.S. 156 8th Grade Graduation in 1951\n\nIt Is With Much Sadness That We Report The Passing of\n\nSue-Carol Ludacer Nussbaum, '50, who began these wonderful memories\n\nOkay, here goes:\n\nWhere are all the train riders? Where are those of us who stood on the platforms of Laurelton and Rosedale stations and waited for the Long Island Railroad to take us to school?. Where are those of us, who had our own culture, the culture of P.S. 156, and Merrick Road, later to become Merrick Blvd? What happened to those of us who made the choice to go to Far Rockaway and opt for the train instead of the bus to Andrew Jackson High School, thus sublimating ourselves to the overwhelming culture of the Rockawayites? Even now, as I log onto the site, it is overwhelmingly of the Rockaways, the public schools they attended, the shops they frequented and the friends they made.\n\nLet's hear about what happened to that vibrant culture, the kids from Laurelton, who went to Chung's Chinese restaurant and Safran's delicatessen and the Woolworths on the corner of 129th street and Merrick Road. How many remember going to Jamaica to the Valencia theater, with it's fantastic sky-like ceiling filled with stars and clouds, or for our first part time jobs in Macy's or the many shops along Jamaica Ave? Who among you remember the \"Itch\" our Laurelton movie house and meeting friends there? Is anyone as old as I am who can remember when the Bee Line bus ran along Merrick Road, before it became a Blvd, and the city busses ran on it? Does anyone out there remember Walter's taxi or Marder's pharmacy, and who among you can tell me what happened to P.S. 156, where I made my first friends? Where are you all? I remember Laurelton, and my Irish, German, and Jewish friends as the great melting pot of my youth. I remember going to St. Claire's church in Rosedale with my Catholic friends, because Laurelton didn't have one Catholic church.\n\nI brag about my childhood with anyone who will listen, but where have you all gone?\n\nBTW, I graduated from P.S. 156 in June of 1946. I know it's a long time ago, but there must be some of my classmates a) who are still living, and b) who have learned to use a computer. Let's hear it for Laurelton. We were always in the minority, but that doesn't mean we should remain invisible.\n\nNovember 15, 2011\n\nHello Skip, I just came across the Laurelton site on my computer so I thought I'd put in my 2 cents worth. My parents moved to Laurelton in 1936 when I was 14. My dad had a fruit and vegetable store at 224-11 141st Ave. We lived in 5 rooms behind the store (2 brothers and a sister) I graduated from St Mary Magdalene's grammar school and was fortunate to win a 4 year scholarship to St John's Prep (at that time at Lewis And Willoughby in Brooklyn) worth then about $400.00! I delivered clothing from the tailor shop that was just on the west side or the rr trestle on 243st after school on my bike for 5 cents a delivery. That was my carfare to Jamaica and then on the el to Bklyn. I went to Queens College (up in Jamaica Estates) for 2 years until the war interrupted. I joined the Air Force (at that time it was still part of the U.S. Army) I flew a P-51 on escort missions for B-24s over Germany. I was shot down by ground fire while strafing an airfield after leaving the bombers on the return trip and after evading for two days I was captured and spent the last three months as a POW.\n\nI married in 1948 and we had 2 sons and a daughter. I worked for my uncles at a wholesale grocery they owned in Brooklyn and when they retired I bought it from them. My younger son, Steven, worked with me and took over when I retired in 1978. I have had a full and happy life and I thank God every day for the beautiful family he blessed me with: eight grandchildren and now two great-greats! I live in Rosedale now (since 1945) and spend my time reading,playing games on the computer and reminiscing about \"the good old days. God Bless America.\n\nAlbert R.DiPaola Email Address: Alrd79@aol.com\n\nOctober 10, 2011\n\nI just found your web site but there are no recent posts so want to be sure it is active. I lived in Laurelton from about 1951 to 1975, always at the same house, 225th st between 135 and 137 avenues. I will be glad to share of myself too, if this is still active. I went to PS156, grades1-6, then JHS59, 7-9, then Andrew Jackson 10-12. Bar Mitzvah from Laurelton Jewish Center...will be the 50th anniversary of my Bar Mitzvah soon.\n\nThanks.\n\nBarry E. Pitegoff Email Address: barryp227@gmail.com\n\nMay 9, 2011\n\nHi Skip,\n\nMy maiden name was Romanowicz and I have a sister Janet and a brother John. We lived first on 233rd Street - next door to the Rothbards and across from the Horowitz family and up the block from the DesGaines on the corner of 233rd street and 139th Avenue in a big corner house with about 100 rose bushes from about the late 1950's. Attended 156 from Kindergarten with Mrs. Rockower and Mrs. Robinson and then through 4th grade (remember learning French with a Queens accent with Mrs. Schwartz). Then in about 1965/66 or so we moved to Long Island but my mother hated the Island and so we moved back to Laurelton - this time on 230th Street between 138-139th Avenue where we lived until 1974.\n\nWe had a lot of great times in both houses. Stickball on the corners, stoop ball, hide and seek, listening for Eddie the Good Humour man and the Doogan man to deliver the milk. I remember playing in 156 school yard tag and the huge Great Dane on the corner next to the school. since the Bungalo Bar man always came at dinner time, we were not allowed to buy from him and actually made up a really sad song about his ice cream. I remember playing hide and seek in the backyards and having block parties where the entire block came out and celebrated together.\n\nLike Calvin Polivy, I too remember Lloyd and Dwight Hutchinson and on my corner there were two brothers whose mother taught piano and who we thought was the most beautiful woman in the world. My next door neighbors on 230th street was Isla (?) Bates and her family and we had a lot of good times together. I was really sad when we made the move to Long Island in 1974 and never felt anything but a true Queens Person. I am now back in Queens, Jackson Heights, and love it.\n\nDonna Mulvany Email Address: Donna.Mulvany@skadden.com\n\nMay 9, 2011\n\nMy aunt and uncle, Hilda and Lenny Strauss, lived across the street from Marty, his brother Barry, and mom Annie Lebu. In the summers my Uncle Lenny would get a game of softball going in the middle of the street. Being significantly younger than the Lebu boys (not so much any more), that was the only time I would interact with them. My cousins are Jeffrey Strauss (deceased), Natalie and Diane Strauss. Others in the game and from the block I recall who would have known Marty are next door neighbor Lois Pohl, Larry Rudin, and Joel and Harvey Brind. There was always a lot going on on that block. Great memories.\n\nMy condolences to Marty's wife, children and family.\n\nNaomi Dreskin Email Address: ndreskin@comcast.net\n\nApril 17, 2011\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI did not live in Laurelton - our school was called St. Albans. Our home street backed up to Andrew Jackson when it was listed as St. Albans. Later years was called Cambria Heights. I too am looking for classmates. So far - none of responded. There were students from Laurelton who attended my High School. Graduated from St. Albans grammar school: High School: 1942 graduated - 1946 graduated from High School. Sure would love to correspond - remember some of the places you listed in your site. Hope to hear from you. First time going on this site so I hope to hear from some old friends.\n\nDagmar Gordon Newman - Email Address: Seniorstitcher@aol.com\n\nApril 17, 2011\n\nHi every one. My name is Al Rubinstein I did not grow up in Lauralton, but was around there a lot in that the school that I went to P.S. 135 asked me to leave in the 4 grade around 1973. My new school was for now what they now call special education children. It was more of a wear house for kids that got into fights. A lot of the kids came from Lauralton/ Rosedale area. I got to see the neighborhoods because the bus would go thought the area. I also went to Happy Woods daycamp in Rosedale by or in Brookville Park. Once again the bus would go by the neighborhoods.\n\nThe questions that I have are, On Francis Lewis Blvd close to Andrew Jackson H.S. is a water of electrical substation. In the very front was a brick cut out and there was a plack to someone or something. It was stolen and I remembered this because I was the last kid off the bus and the driver had made some comments about the changes to the area. Any one remember the plaque? The second question is was there a Jewish Temple within 4 blocks of Jamaica Ave on Francis Lewis blvd. I have done some research and found out that one of the building up there used to be a VFW.\n\nAl Rubinstein - Email Address: Bikeral467@aol.com\n\nApril 17, 2011\n\nHI SKIP\n\nI LIVED AT 133-87 HOOK CREEK BLVD ROSEDALE 1938-1962.

I just spent the better part of an evening reading what people wrote. I wish there were more people from Rosedale who participated.\n\nMy name is Fran Solecki nee Rosen and I went to PS 138 and then on to Andrew Jackson.I graduated in 1959 and lived in Rosedale until 2004. I am currently living in Glen Oaks but only until January as I just bought a home in the Sebastian area of Florida. Growing up in Rosedale I lived on 147th Rd. I also remember what a great town it was and how life was much more simpler back then. I remember taking a school bus to school and praying it broke down by the cemetery so we could walk home and skip school. Rode my bike to where ever I wanted to go even to Rockaway Beach down Snake Road. After I married (my name became Pomerance back then) I bought a house in Rosedale on 149th Road and my 3 children went to PS 195 and then Springfield Gardens Jr High and then High School. It was a great place to raise my children. As my children were growing up I joined and became active in the various PTA's and then the School Board and the Ambulance Corp. If anyone remembers me or cares to contact me I would love to here from them. My e-mail is fsolecki@gmail.com.\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nGreetings Skip,\n\nI was born in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital on March 8,1964 and moved into Laurelton 6 months later. I attended 156 and later Jamaica High. Though now called Kings County (the hospital), I believe that PS 156 was monickered The Laurelton School. Minor changes all in all.I write because of a picture I saw on your wonderful site which literally brought me to tears, and my knees. I remember waking up the morning after the owner of Stanleys was murdered and calling all my friends to meet me at the store. I was horrified to see not just his store but the entire block gone due to a fire that was set to destroy evidence of the murder. It was my belief that the owner was in fact Stanley, a crothcetty old man who always seemed like you were bothering him by coming into his store. He had this 300 year old Beagle that was fat as a pig and always appeared to be on his last legs. But we patronized him daily. Bubble gum, sponge balls, comic books and baseball cards all in abundance. The store was always a mess, but he knew where everything was. If it were still there today, in the same condition it would be a candidate for the shoe 'Hoarders'. I will NEVER forget the feeling I got in my stomach when we all arrived at the store. It was surreal. Almost like a dream. I only heard the store burned. When I got there is when we found out the guy had been murdered. He lived in the back of the store and the belief was that he surprised robbers and they killed him. Back then, however, the neighborhood was predominently black, and the rummor started that there were some kids who didn't like a white man running a store in the neighborhood. What ever the case I want to say to you thank you and bless you for this site. I really have nothing but memories to contribute, and most of the folks contributing are from a time a little before mine, but my k-12 years and then some were spent in this town, and now I can relive some of the memories.\n\nBefore I sign off, can you tell me what, if anything, was under the traffic circle on 225 st just north of the LIRR station? I've been told that all the sewage pipes for south Queens meet and becom one large pipe going to Jamaica Bay, but cannot get confirmation. Please post that question so someone who might know can contact me. I live in Ft Worth Tx now but get back to NY every now and again. My email is SUNDANCKIDD@yahoo.com. I welcome any and all emails. Again thank you and god bless.\n\nPS- What is the current function of the old LJC?\n\nMatt Email Address: SUNDANCKIDD@yahoo.com\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI registered a week or so ago but I’m not sure I used the right address. I’ll send similar material again.\n\nMy parents and I moved to 134-36 233rd Street on May 28, 1928. It was still pretty sandy although the newly arriving residents were busily applying topsoil and sod. Our neighbor, Mr. Paul Johnsen was out front watering his new lawn as we drove up to our new house. At age 3, I remember that moment vividly.\n\nI began kindergarten in 1930 at PS 38. By 1931 PS 156 had been completed and I went there to first grade. My teacher was Bessie S. Lee. Second grade was Mrs. Frank. Other teachers I recall were Mrs. Mormile, Mrs. Sears, Mrs. Cross, Mrs. Wilde and Mrs. Wenhold. Joseph Baron was the principal.\n\nBy the seventh and eighth grade I was quite interested in candid photography. I had many pictures of our baseball team, general school activities and teachers in the classroom. Mrs. Wenhold did not approve of me snapping her during a music class while in full throat at all. She confiscated my camera and sent me to see Mr. Baron. He too was an amateur photographer and while returning my camera, suggested I pursue more acceptable photographic activities. To help me along, he gave an application form for the New York City public school photography contest. I entered and won three or four blue ribbons plus a cash award! I’ve always thought Mr. Baron did a superb job in that circumstance as an educator and guidance counselor!\n\nOur class graduated in June of 1938. For many years I had the class picture and the leather bound autograph album containing the signatures of my classmates, teachers and friends. Those were lost on one of the moves I made in the ensuing years.\n\nI began Andrew Jackson HS Sept. 1938 and would have graduated with the Class of 1942 had our family not moved from Laurelton to upstate New York on November 27, 1941, ten days before Pearl Harbor which as it happens, was my 17th birthday! I graduated at the high school I transferred to in Chautauqua County, NY.\n\nSome names I remember who were in my class were; Francis Porter, Lita Friedman (our Valedictorian), Eileen McDonald, Warren Carroll, Philip Spitz, Ralph Barasch, Arne Larsen, Owen Rogde, Bernard Marks and Elizabeth Neidermaier.\n\nOthers in the neighborhood were Gus Isler, Gertrude Galligan, Marilyn (Mickey) Barlow, Shirley Feldzenfeld, Alvin Dolan, Carlo Solferino, Sonny Maiello, Alice Muller, Albert and Robert Koehler, Stanley Prudowski, Frank Morris and Eileen Raines. I know there were many more.\n\nReading some of the entries here on this fascinating site I saw a few mentions of the Valencia Theatre in Jamaica. Many years I wrote a paper on the theatre’s design. It was among the last of the “palace” type theatres, featuring moonlit Spanish gardens beneath a sky full of twinkling stars. The designer was John Ebersole. With the advent of sound and the Depression, movie houses became quite different venues.\n\nAs for famous people living in the area, one I haven’t seen mentioned was Ray Collins. During the 30’s he lived on 233rd. He was part of the cast of Orson Welles’ radio program, “The Mercury Theater.” With the advent of television, Ray found his niche as Inspector Tragg on “The Perry Mason – Detective” show.\n\nThis site triggers so many memories for me, I’ll not bore you with more of them. Laurelton was a great place to live and grow up. If any of you recall any of the people I’ve listed, or know their whereabouts, I’d appreciate your dropping me a line. Thanks.\n\nDon Curtis - Email Address: dcurtis12@cox.net\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nHi Skip – I moved to Laurelton from Astoria in 1959, in the middle of sixth grade. Mr. Gambino was my teacher for the rest of that year. I was a shy kid but Laurelton became my safe haven until we were forced by my dad’s work to move to Hollywood, Ca. in the middle of my junior year of high school (Jackson). I don’t think I ever got over it! I guess I wasn’t the only one who loved our neck of the woods. In junior high I worked at a card store on Merrick Blvd. called The Colony I think and got ‘fired’ because I took to long to help an old lady find a card. I lived on 229th street between The Kerman’s and the Levin’s and across the street from the Narby’s. I was in the band with Mr. Haber and took clarinet lessons from Mr. Pendel (a down the street neighbor). I learned to ride a bike with no hands and thought I was so cool when I could turn corners without using the handlebars! “Meet you half way” was a constant refrain – meeting a girl friend between her house and mine. Susan Gluck, Jill Mendelsohn, Paul Marx, Claire Weitz, Judy Tannenbaum strike clear images in my mind. Teachers like Ms Rosenkrantz, Mr. Meehan, those crazy math teacher-sisters, Sugar and ??, that incredible chorus teacher – we sang Exodus on stage and I thought I’d gone to heaven –some crazy French teacher who made us bring in all our green stamps! – and so many others! I’ve stayed in touch with Susan and a few others but was never part of a ‘crowd’. I hung out with my French teacher, Mrs. Pilgrim, almost every day after high school. I remember ‘Sing’ and how amazing the kids who wrote and choreographed the material were. I lived in southern and then northern California for years and now live in Portland, Maine. It is wonderful to hear everybody’s great memories of what I still consider home! Thanks for creating this site.\n\nNiki Gilbert - Email Address: nikithewolf@hotmail.com\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nDear Skip,\n\nMy family moved to Springfield Gardens in 1945, I was 2 ears old. I started school in 1949, at St. Mary Magdalene's I graduated in 1957. I went to Archbishop Malloy H.S. in the Brentwood section of Jamaica. My phone number was LA 5-3488. I remember hanging with Charlie Gerardi, not with his brother Freddie. We hung out on the corner of 225 st and Merrick road (Ed and Lills). with a bunch of other guys, whose names i cannot remember. I remember the parties at Charlies house, about once a month when his parents would go away for the weekend. Nuff said. I also had Tom Ryan as a friend, also My fires true love Diane Tomanelli, who I dated for several tumultuous years, from about 1960 until 1964, the last breakup.\n\nI would like to get in touch with anyone who remembers me. People like Bobby Hoffman, Bobby Hoffmann, Maureen O'hallorne. I also used to hang out at the rock shop next to the bar on 219 th St. Mr Ted Fredericks owned this shop. We became friends along with his wife and Daughter. Mr and Mrs Fredericks, have passed on in the last few years, but their daughter and I have made contact with each other after 45 years.\n\nIf you want to know more about Carol Fredericks, just google her name. I have also gotten in contact with Tom Dunphy,after 45 years also. Tom is retired U.S. Air force, and lives in Nebraska. I hung around most all of Laurelton, and yes I do miss it. All for now,\n\nEdward Krolikowski - Email Address: skee194302@yahoo.com\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nDear Skip, I didn't go to FRHS, but some of my most vivid memories are of going to FR to swim, usually to Beach 35th Street, starting during WWII when I was in PS 156. Shortly after the war began, the surf started to wash up oily driftwood and tar balls from torpedoed merchant vessels. U- boats came undersea to within almost shouting distance of the beach. They were especially dangerous before the blackout system was enforced. Background light from the City as a whole as well as from boardwalk shops and walking lights was ideal for forming a silhouette of a ship. Much later, during a 1949 heat wave, I went to sleep at the beach with some other guys. (Most people did not yet have home AC.) One who went was Bob Builder, who is registered on this site. Bad idea! The night was noisy, chilly, and damp.Changing the subject, I also have a lot of memories of biking to Hook Creek Boulevard and the area where there is now a large shopping mall across the Sunrise Highway. The most southern part of this neighborhood was marshland and a place where I went crabbing.( Probably polluted, but what did I know?) In the middle of this unoccupied wasteland was a a 3-story edifice ,The [something] Inn, which was widely regarded as a house of ill-repute. To the east was an airfield used by a an aircraft manufacturing plant that after the war first became a drive- in movie theatre and later the aforesaid shopping mall(where someone was killed a few years ago during a sales day stampede). I also remember making a sharp retort to an inebriated, adult bigot, while riding home on the Q5 bus, during Jackie Robinson's first season at Brooklyn.\n\nAlan Saks, now age 78 Email Address: ajsaks24@hotmail.com\n\nApril 16, 2011\n\nI read with interest about Laurelton's history and it brought back a lot of memories. Although I lived in Rosedale, I spent a lot of time there. I'm Gary London. I was born 3/31/45 at Park Hospital in St. Albans. It was very small. My mother had the whole second floor to herself. Her 12 day visit cost ninety five dollars! I think the rates have gone up since.\n\nThe day after she brought me home, FDR died. My parents were married in Buffalo where my brother Jim was born in 1936. My father went to trade school and they moved to Queens in 1936 and got a job with Granado Appliance repairing radios. He never worked anywhere else until his death in 1976. They moved to 243rd street in \"the back\" of Rosedale (south of Conduit Ave.) and stayed there until moving to a two family at 134-38 241 Street, one block from Brookville. Granado, by the way, which was owned by Les Mansley and a long Laurelton staple was supposed to be \"Granada\" but the sign was incorrectly lettered and they left it that way. The original Granado was on Merrick Rd. I know in the city it is Merrick Blvd. but most of us called it Rd, was near 234th street. Then they moved to the corner of Merrick and Francis Lewis. It was an old supermarket. I being there as a youngster when it was being gutted. Granado stayed there until moving to Valley Stream where it still is in business, being run by Ernie and Greg, Les' sons. A Martin Paint store replaced Granado.\n\nThe 241st. house was two family. But the owners lost it and my parents took it over. We had a border living upstairs but the downstairs was too small for a family of four and it became single family in 1950. My brother and I both went to P.S. 38, a half block from home. What a horrible school. They had these old workhorses as teachers and it is\n\nguessed they let the have the end of their careers in a nice lily white school. The principal was the legendary Mertie M. Cool, who weighed over 300 pounds and barely five feet tall. She treated everybody like 38 was a concentration camp. She once bawled out the parents in the audience at a graduation glass for applauding for each of the only 32\n\ngraduates. She didn't want to waste the time.I was told after I left 38, that Miss Cool would not accept the grant money from the city to maintain the school. \"I'm not wasting my tax money on that place!\" What a gem. Coming home from a field trip on the bus, I began singing \"Around Miss Cool in 80 days.\" The teachers all joined in. Among the teachers was Justina Murphy, maybe the most unattractive woman on earth. She had a bad temper and she hated everyone that wasn't in her class. I was in the 7th grade when she taught the 8th (thank God). We were playing a softball game one day and my buddy Dick Schaefer, playing right field ran past the centerfielder who was asleep and made a great rolling catch, costing Murphy's class three runs. She yelled at him saying he had no right to catch that ball! One teacher, Mrs. Houston had us working in the garden all year. We didn't learn anything. The last two years, 7th and 8th, I had Miss Flack, a music teacher. All we did was sing. When we got to high school, one of the Jackson teachers had a bunch of us in her math class.She wondered why we didn't know anything. I remember every week we had a fire drill and an air raid siren alert because Khruschev was going to bomb us! It's amazing we weren't paranoid.\n\nAcross from Brookville Blvd was Twin Ponds or \"Twinnies\" as we called it. I walked through the vacant lot behind my house and crossed Brookville and went fishing. We used to catch lots of carp. It was great. Then around 1954, they widened the parkway and the ponds dried up. They use to ice skate in the winter and Jim's friend Eddie Campbell\n\nfell in one night I remember. The parkway project made things a mess. Two houses were moved from north of Merrick several blocks near St. Clare's church. They were moved on railroad tracks and it took a long time. I still know which two houses they are. I wonder if the current owners are aware of it? They had to build a temporary wooden bridge while the new ones were installed. I remember one day traffic was stopped for blocks. A woman was too scared to drive over it. Another motorist had to take the wheel.\n\nLaurelton was like a small city. I understand the name was for a housing development that never got built. Laurelton's mail was handled up to 232nd Street by Springfield Gardens, higher up by Rosedale. Laurelton was the name of the phone exchange. There was lots of shopping in Laurelton. In fact you could by a new Nash at Herman Motors by the Texaco station on Laurelton Parkway. There was a used car lot on Merrick between 229th and 230th streets. It was run by a bald headed guy. For years I yelled \"Hey Baldy\" from my Andrew Jackson school bus. He tried to run after the bus but never caught it. I guess he was gonna deny his folicle shortcomings! Homeyer Ford was near 219th Street I think, then there was Laurel Chevrolet.\n\nI made a lot of trips to Laurelton. There was virtually no stores in Rosedale. I walked with my mother and she pushed my old baby carriage to carry the groceries. Right at the corner was Tommy Lynch's custard stand. Us kids were lucky, we could get ice cream without crossing the street. The there was Jo-Art's fruit stand. Joe Cuneo was Italian but he always had an Irish brogue and told everybody his name was O'Riley. I have no idea why. Then came Valerio's beer distributorship. Then we crossed Brookville and walked over the bridge. The Sunrise supermarket was across the street. Things went downhill later when it became Grand Union. Next door was the Diamond ravioli store and\n\nthe Laurelton Luncheonette. Melo's cleaners was there a long time. Many of the next stores changed over the years. I remember a toy store. Then came Twin Pond's Bakery and on the corner the candy store. My parents were good friends with the Jack Resnicks who owned it. They moved to run another business but they rented it first to Al Burd,\n\nthen Moe and Shirley Weissman and then Manny and Zelda Borenstein. At Manny's & Zelda's it was like the TV show Cheers with egg creams the attraction instead of beer. Many of us spent a lot of time there and a lot of laughs. Dankner's pharmacy was in the next block. My father liked to buy presents there because they gift wrapped everything. Then came the 'second candy store.\" It was run by concentration camp survivors who used to stand in front of the store so passersby would see the ID's etched on them.\n\nCrossing 233rd street was Kearn's bicycle shop. Mrs. Kearns was quite a card, kind of a 50's Roseanne. I remember her husband went to Basso's next door, bought a rope and hung himself. Next to the barber shop was the Atlantic meat market and Jacob's Deli. the Jacobs were from Germany like most deli owners and had great goodies. Drutt's Men's store was next. Mr.and Mrs. Drutt were like all the older Jewish store owners you see in movies. There were nice people. My mother used to buy shirts in there and they let her pay a dollar a week. I remember across Merrick when they built the bank. It was called Springfield Gardens first. There was another branch on the corner of Merrick and Springfield. Also on that side was Zlotnick's shoe repair. He was a nice man. He always donated an award at PS 38 graduations. The highlight was Whelan's drug store. They had a refrigerated drawer where they had Hershey's bars. There was nothing better on a hot day than an ice cold almond bar, for six cents. Loomis hardware and Wong's take out restaurant were regular stops. The Ridgewood bank was across from Granado and it was help up one day and the cops used Granado across the street as a HQ. I almost forget Eddie's variety store in which he sold a lot of cheap junk.\n\nThe next block was a nightmare. That's where the A & P was. Since we had a small freezer, my mother had to shop almost every day. In the A & P, butchers waited on you and the women used to fight like cats and dogs to get waited on. I was happy when my mother chose Dilberts or Bohack instead. There was an appliance store on 229th & Merrick but I can't remember the name of it. There was nothing like stopping in Raab's lunchenette on a hot day. There were the first store to have AC and it used to be freezing there. The Laurelton theater was on that block and we spent many days there. A true legend was Zickerman's Hardware. They had everything, if they could find it. We seldom went beyond the movie theater. I do remember there was a photography store by 225th next to the Chinese restaurant. I ended up working at the post office one year. It was a dump.\n\nThe Woolworth's on 229th and Merrick was a regular stop. I can still remember how it smelled. I was happy when Joliz record store opened by the show repair. I think it was 227th and Merrick. Thinking back a few blocks, Laurelton was very small town. When you walked past Schindler's shoe store, the owner would look at your feet to see if you were wearing his product. They had a box you stuck your feet in and it took X-rays to see if they fit right. Not only didn't that make any sense but the government outlawed them for safety.\n\nThen in 1958, Green Acres shopping center was built and our days at Laurelton, except for Manny & Zelda's were pretty much gone. Green Acres was built on the site of Curtiss Field. My brother flew his model airplanes there. Speaking of planes, during WWII, a plan crashed (think it was military) into the farm which later become the supermarket between Laurelton Parkway and 234th St. My grandmother took my brother to see it. This reminds me of the dog kennel by 233rd. I remember when the Rosedale bowling alley was built in 1960. Sadly it's gone. I bowled at Pavillon in VS where Texas Guinan used to have her night club. The alleys in Green Acres and Valley Strean Rec. are all gone too. I have read several time that the first McDonalds was on Brookville and Merrick. That is wrong. It was Merrick and 243rd. It was not an eat in. They tore it down and built the one across the street. That corner for years was O'Connor's tavern. They tried to build a school there before realizing the noise from the airplanes would make it impractical. For years the unbuilt school lay there before finally putting up office buildings. The airplane noise was unbearable. When the wind blew from the south, they flew right over our house. You couldn't sleep, watch TV and talk on the phone. Complaining to a local politician, he told my mother that she shouldn't have moved so close to the airport. She explained that the house was there long before Idlewild. One other memory was not of Laurelton but I bet a few of you went there. There was a Richard's drive-in on Sunrise Hwy in RVC. I think it is where the King Kullen is. They had great hot dogs on a seeded roll. A dog and a milk shake were fifty cents! There were lots of memories and reading this site helped me remember. I hope I help some recall some things too. I'm not far away. I moved from Rosedale to Valley Stream in 1984.\n\nGary London Email Address: Racewriter771@aol.com\n\nJanuary 18, 2011\n\nMy family moved to laurelton in 1945 when I was three years old. Attended kindergarten at 156. Spent the rest of elementary school at 38 in rosedale. I rmember my third grade teacher, Mrs. Hiel. ( think hiel hitler) she was cynical and mean. I remember my first little girl friend whom I met in the 2nd grade., diane huebner. Loved her for years. reconnected with her forty years later. very pleasant experience. during the high school years hung out in rosedale( brookville park, twin ponds, pizza king) with the bad and wanna be bad boys. remember the fist fights and weekly parties in rosedale. also hung out in raabs sweet shop, corner of 228 and merrick. my puerto rican girl friend lived right up the block. on my 17th birthday, had a savage fight with mike teague, a recently released punk who had insisted on making passes at my puerto rican girl friend vickey vega. I bloodied him up good! . Left laurelton after high school years. lived in lynbrook. eventually calmed down and went to college ( st johns). My family founded Christopher Robin Academy on 223 st. I acquired the school years later and administered it until my retirement in 2006. touched many lives and made a lot of money. living now in rockville center. enjoying life and looking back with a smile.\n\nBob Donus Email Address: zorba642@aol.com\n\nJanuary 18, 2011\n\nI lived at on 230Th Place & 138 Avenue from the mid 1930s to 1952 when I graduated college and went to Princeton,NJ with my wife to start my engineering life which took me all over the world. My sister lived on 228 Street & Merrick Blvd. where her husband practiced dentistry and raised her family. I went via the LIRR to Brooklyn Tech HS. and later to college at Brooklyn Poly. I now live in Los Altos, Ca. The picture of PS 156 brought back memories of basketball games with buddies like Bob Cousy who went on to Holy Cross and later starred for the Boston Celtics. We played for the Jewish Center vs other teams. There were stables in Rosedale and we rode the horses to beaches since rural life had not yet been taken over by the city.\n\nSeymour B. Alpert Email Address: syalt@flash.net\n\nJanuary 18, 2011\n\nHi Skip:\n\nI came across your website looking for an old friend and it brought back to really nice memories. I never lived in Laurelton but came to know it well. My father operated a Kosher butcher shop next to Mulvaney's Tavern from the mid-40's to 1959. Cutler Bros. was it's name and I spent many summer days on a bike delivering orders to his customers. I believe the name of the Italian restaurant was Capri, not Carpi as shown on your site. Good food - they actually bought some of their meat from my father - at least the meatballs were Kosher.\n\nDennis Cutler Email Address: dect4e@juno.com\n\nJanuary 17, 2011\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Donna Noble. I was Donna Thomas. My address was 219-19 134th Rd. Laurelton, NY 14113. My father was in the Air Force so we lived there only 2 years between 1967 & 1969. I was born 1961. I went to St Mary Magdalene Catholic School. I remember riding the bus on Merrick Blvd with my grandmother. I remember riding the L downtown. I got my ears pierced when I lived in NY. I remember a really bad snow storm I think the winter of 1967 and the snow was above the cars. I live in Colorado and don't ever remember a snowstorm that bad here. I remember the day MLK was shot. St Margaret Teresa was my teacher. I remember lining up in the morning by height when it was time to go in. There were two sets of twins who were shorter than me. One each in my class and one each in the other first grade. I had a friend who lived down the street name Cheryl . I remember two boys in my class. Glen Ramos and Anthony something. I remember the cloak room. I remember milk time. My church had Bingo. I also remember for lunch my mom would put an orange in my lunch and a straw. She had squeezed it so I got juice. Cool. I will talk to my sister when I get home to see what memories she has.\n\nI went on Bing Maps and saw the view of my house.\n\nI can be reached at donna.noble@qwest.com I am also on Facebook. (DMN)\n\nApril 28, 2010\n\nRemember the movie West Side Story?..... I remember walking down the street with my friends re-enacting the song and dance......... Ice Skating at Twin Ponds, playing in the Park and hanging out at \"the Greens\". Playing Stoop Ball, Stick Ball, Hand Ball and bottle tops. Sledding by the Parkway, Hanging out in Green Acres, bowling, going to the movies, riding my bike ....... and eating Pizza and Chinese. Oh and lets not forget Walcliff for rolla skating and swimming in the summer.\n\nWho remembers ME ??\n\nMarla BERENHAUS Banta\n\nolder brother Steve and younger brother Scott\n\nemail me at MarlaGenealogy@aol.com\n\nApril 28, 2010\n\nHello Laurelton \"kids\" (especially LJC alumni). I am happy to report that I happened to find Rabbi Saul Teplitz living happily in retirement in South Florida. My wife and I visited him, and his wife, a few months ago. Although he did not remember what was served at our wedding in 1957 (neither do I), he is in pretty good shape and it was very pleasant to briefly re-capture a little lost youth.\n\nDan Alman 130-54 229St, Far Rock '53 Email Address: Alman@bellsouth.net\n\nApril 28, 2010\n\nFrom Gary L. Schechter, M.D. P.S. 156 Class of 1952.\n\nWhat a delightful finding!! I was \"Googling\" my old H.S. fraternity, AZA, when the 156 website came up. Life for me in Laurelton was fantastic. Even when they took a couple of years to put in the sewer system and ripped up all of the streets, we had a blast. P.S. 156 itself was a great experience, but what the people and streets of Laurelton had to offer were equally fantastic. Traveling to Far Rockaway H.S. on the L.I.R.R. daily, living with the real \"Fonzees,\" being able to slip into Manhattan as a teenager, safely I might say, and growing up with the Merrick Road culture, made us all better people as we matured. I could go on, but I would be preaching to the choir.\n\nMy family moved out to Merrick in 1954, so I graduated from Mepham H.S., but that did not negate the benefits of growing up in Laurelton. My life has been blessed with education, a professional degree ( I am a retired surgeon), a wonderful family ( 1 wife of 52 years, 3 children all off the payroll, and 7 grandchildren of dubious personalities ), but my story inevitably starts back one way or other to the P.S.156 school yard, Mr. Shields shop class, the matron herding the kids in the movie theatre, or Shary's (?sp) bakery on Merrick Road. What a life. Thanks to you all for putting this website together. What fun to think of those days.\n\nGary L. Schechter, M.D. Williamsburg, VA Email Address gls1939@live.com\n\nFebruary 14, 2010\n\nSkip, I was looking for the spelling of Charlotte Russe a delicious sponge cake and whipped cream treat that Woolworth’s used to sell.\n\nI came across your Laurelton site. I grew up in a non-English speaking German neighborhood (children had to speak English and were not allowed to speak German) in Glendale, NY off Myrtle avenue – went to St. Pancreas school and church and yes I remember the Valencia theater. I was 9 years old when we moved to Jamaica. I was one of 6 children and we lived at 69th place. Mrs. Holser was the landlady upstairs. When the 6th child was due, Mom & Dad (a Police Sgt. In NY) had to find a house. The war was over and they finally could buy a home. Mr. Bock was the ice man who lived next door (but we had a refrigerator). The coal man would come and deliver and on our birthday we could have seltzer water and syrup.\n\nDuring the war with ration coupons, we had to take turn going to the grocery store to buy detergent. My Dad worked down near the slaughter houses in NY, so we were lucky to have meat and he made sure his 3 sisters and Mom and Dad did too.\n\nSo many memories – a good childhood in the neighborhood – we would take the trolley on Myrtle Avenue to Forest Park. The Monpoly game never quit on the front stoop and whoever had to go to dinner, someone would fill in.\n\nThanks for the memories. I now live in So. California, but still enjoy going back to the East Coast.\n\nVirginia Cook Email Address: sterlingorg@sbcglobal.net\n\nNovember 22, 2009\n\nSkip,\n\nI just stumbled on your website and it brought back nothing but good memories. I grew up in Laurelton...I spent my early years in the Garden Apartments and then moved in my grandparents house at 130-29 233rd Street. My grandparents were the Borucks, who were involved with Temple Beth El. My mother Carol, and my aunt Lois went to PS 38. That's where I went to school until I moved to NJ in 1972. I have great memories of my time in Laurelton. Walking to school, passing all the stores on Merrick Road, getting Egg Creams with my grandfather, going to the bakery(don't remember the name) playing stickball at PS 38, playing punchball wherever we could, football games on the grass at 38. Anytime I go to see relatives on LI, I take my kids past the old house. They say \"you grew up there??\", and I tell them about how much fun it was. I remember going to see Lew Alcindor(Kareem Abdul Jabbar) play basketball in the school yard. I could go on forever...\n\nAnyway, great job on the website and hopefully someone from the old neighbor remembers me and gets in touch.\n\nThanks!!\n\nAlan Feldman\n\n130-29 233rd St.(old Address) Email Address: Alan.Feldman@yrclogistics.com\n\nDecember 6, 2009\n\nSkip,\n\nMy name is Joe Ferrara and I grew up with my sister Pat, and brother Tom at 131-29 227th St. My family moved there in 1953 and moved in 1970. I went to\n\nPS132, JHS59 and Andrew Jackson. My friends at the time were Jay Katz, Stan Marcus, Marty Reich, Mark Sauerhoff, Larry Stark, Rita Smith, Paula Katz,\n\nJohnny Butera, Barbara & Steven Katz, Gary Weintraub, Eddie Rothlein, Kenny Hason, Arnie Feldman, Alex Papako, Michael Fisher, George Burner, Mark Weiner, Bonnie and Andrea Kwardowitz(spelling?), Cynthia Dilbert, Jerry and David Robbins, Steven Kessler, Janet Marcune, and the one I married Claudia Lahti. I know I have forgotten many others but hopefully people will recognize some of the names and reply with their own lists. We hung out by the Depot and Burt and Daves doing nothing and everything. The best times of my life were spent in Laurelton, and you cannot seem to explain it to people today without gettting the \"look\" like \"what are you talking about?\".\n\nHow can you explain the good old days without sounding like you come from another planet? Yet Laurelton stands out as being the one place that I've ever\n\nheard of that still has hundreds, if not thousands of people still going to reunions of a town not a school. Where growing up was a magical experience\n\nthat can never be duplicated. What a wonderfull time and childhood I had there. It has been a great trip back in time to read all the letters sent in. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT.\n\nJOE FERRARA Email Address: SMR183@AOL.COM\n\nNovember 26, 2009\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI remember a few places, like the old laundromat on the corner of maybe 229 or 230th street, south side. I used to hang out there in the 60's with a gang called the Warlords. (probably better forgotten)\n\nDebbie Agin now Rose Beane Email Address: leebeane@gmail.com\n\nNovember 5, 2009\n\nSkip,\n\nI showed my 88 year old uncle, (Edward Gannon), the pictures about Capt.

We lived there until I graduated from Springfield Gardens High School in 1970. After attending PS 156 from K-6th grade, I was in the transition class at JH 59 when it turned from 7-9th grade to a 6-8 and was in the first 9th grade at the new Springfield Gardens High School. Saturday mornings found me at the Laurelton Theater watching the movie with the matron in the white coat and flashlight keeping us in order. I’d then go to the pizza place on the corner of 227th and Merrick Rd to have a slice and a drink all for a quarter. Mrs. Goldschmidt was my fifth and sixth grade teacher. I now live in Portland Oregon and teach a second/third grade mixed age class of wonderfully diverse children- I have ten languages in my classroom. I’ve been trying to find three friends from my Laurelton days but have been unsuccessful. Does anyone know how I can contact Arlene Gottesfeld, Mary Stabile, and Ellen Shaddock (sp)? Arlene and Ellen lived in Laurelton and Mary lived in Rosedale. I know Mary lived in Mass for a while and I think moved to the South. Arlene lived in San Antonio, TX for many years but no longer lives there- I heard she might have returned to NY. The last time I connected with Ellen she still lived in NY. I’ll be in NY in mid January 2010 so I would love to be able to reconnect with them. Thanks for hosting this site- it’s wonderful to hear about all these Laurelton memories. Take care,\n\nMartha Gross (Pargament) Email Address: mdgpdx@yahoo.com\n\nNovember 5, 2009\n\nThanks Skip, I know it must be a hard job to update all the inputs you get. I am lucky I still can see the keyborad , I made it to 80 last March. Some clam diggers from back on L. I. came out for the party.\n\nAgain thanks for all your hard work. I had received 4 e-mails that knew about my Uncle and the dog kennel.\n\nI just spoke to my cousin Ernest Engerer jr. he graduated for Jackson. It was his 89 birthday and he is doing great . Lives in Elmont with his wife and now has 7 grandkids all fromhis 4 Daughters. HE IS VERY LUCKY THAT HE DID NOT FOLLOW HIS FATHERS FOOTS STEPS. LION TRAINING IS NOT A LONG TERM JOB.\n\nI know most of the folks came to Laurelton a few years after he went on the road with his circus and cats. His dog kennel caused lots of problems for folks living near by - with the dogs barking and the cats howling in the night . I remember it all . Lucky my Father moved to Valley Stream when I was about 10.\n\nIf anyone is in my cousin Ernie's age bracket 89, I can send them a photo from the L. I PRESS showing Ernest Engerer jr. at 18 years of age in the Lion's cage training a cat and it reads \"Andrew Jackson highschool student training lions\".\n\nLucky for Ernie, the U. S. Army drafted him , and gave him a better job. Training dogs. End on Story time .\n\nFred Engerer Email Address: FREDERICKENGERER@aol.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nSkip - next to Silver's Candy Store was Mark K.

Unfortunately I was unable to buy one at that time and have been using a \"xerox copy\" for many, many years. I will gladly pay for it and shipping costs to Florida. Thanks,\n\nJudy (AJHS Class of 1960) Email Address: Rayoc2000@aol.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nI graduated from PS 156, from Mrs. Seligson's 6th grade class, in 1961. Our entire class made \"SP\" and that was big news. I remember bringing \"milk money\" and \"bank money\" and having to freeze for 1 minute when the bell rang outside, before lining up. I remember the strange little garden outside in the playground. I remember indoor recess games, standing on big white circles painted on the black floor. I remember eating lunch in the auditorium with my farmhouse lunchbox and thermos. I really wanted the pink and blue fairytale lunchbox.\n\nAt JHS 59 my friends were Rita Simon, Ronnie Kanner, Linda Lee, Susan Bayliss and Raymond Wong. We had bus passes for the Q5 that came in different colors each month, that we saved. Ronnie and I were bathroom monitors, and someone stole our pocketbooks with our collection of bus passes. We lived at 135-25 227 St. The boy-next-door was Neal Dreznin, and I sat on the bar of his bike and we rode all over town. Ms. Schneider, the 3rd grade teacher, lived on our block. There was an ex-jockey who kept a horse, and occasionally he would drive down the street riding a sulky. On our street we had Big Barbara and Little Barbara, Neal Dreznin, David Kaback, David Scher, my family (Reba, Jay and Hope Harris) and more. The boys had endless games of catch and stoop ball. All the kids would play games in the street till the lights came on: I Declare War, Scully, Ringo Levio, Ghost. Then we'd sit on the front porches and play \"Cars.\" Whoever picked white or black was sure to win. In the summer we sold lemonade on Merrick Road, and once we dug up the backyard for a minigolf course, and charged admission to play. I'd like to give a shout-out to Mrs. Rand, the ever-patient children's librarian on 225th St.\n\nOur family was a member of the Young Israel of Laurelton. I remember Good Food grocery, Oscar Krieger's butcher, and the printing store where my mom worked with Connie Najmark. We lived back to back with the Vims, and across from Rabbi Romineck, the Finks and the Benjamins. I remember with fondness these friends from the Young Israel: Paula and Gary Katz, Ruthy & Phyllis Gluckman. Jerome & Barry & Phyllis Schwartz, Rena & Alan Jochnowitz, Eddie Parver, Mindy & Ephraim & Yossi Weinblatt, Joey Mayerhoff, Lisa Benjamin, Danny & Ira & Philip Goldschmidt, Leslie Pearl, Chaim & Meyer Fisher, Esther Fried, Merrill Silverstein, Sally Rottenstreich, Doris & Michael Kreisler, the Breitbart girls, Marilyn & Kenny Povodator, Leslie Pearl and more. We had Brownies and Girl Scouts and Little League and Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. We proudly marched each year in the Memorial Day Parade. We had backyard BarBQ's with lots of lighter fluid. We had jobs baby sitting, lawn mowing, delivering newspapers, assisting in youth groups and washing cars.\n\nLaurelton was, and is, a beautiful neighborhood, and I have only the best memories.\n\nReba Harris (now Solomon) living in Plainview Email Address: theShviger@gmail.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nI was searching the internet for a vendor in Laurelton and I stumbled across the Laurelton website. I grew up in Laurelton, went to 156 and 231 and then off to Jamaica High School. I went to 156 in the early 80's. Also was in the girl scouts for years at the Good Lutheran. I have recently moved to Bellerose, but one thing has remained consistent my place of worship. You know it as the old Laurelton Theater, but from the age of 8 I have attended this church. It kept me off the streets, and I've learned so much at this ministry. God blessed us last year to renovate the building from the middle of 227th to the end of the block (use to be Gordon's photographers). Would love for you to stop by to see the renovation at our Street Festival, Saturday, July 18th, 12:00-6:00pm (flyer attached).\n\nI'm just a proud member that grew up in this neighborhood and love my church and after I saw all of the reflections down memory lane, just wanted to give you an update.\n\nSophia Bryan Email Address: sophiabryan@hotmail.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nI remember the store between Stanley's Toy Store and Estelle Peck on the North side between 230 and FLB. It was Stumpfs Hardware run by Gus Stumpf and his son Harry .\n\nKenyon Riches Email Address: kariches@verizon.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi Skip:\n\nMy name is Jay Safran my parents owned Safran's Delicatessen on Merrick road next to Dilberts Grocery Store on the corner of Francis Louis Blvd. I am living in Wesley Chapel Florida a suburb of Tampa . I need a favor from you if you don't mind . Can you change my e-mail address is jaysaf021989@hotmail.com. Would like to hear from anyone who remembers me. I graduated from PS 156 in 1951 and Andrew Jackson HS 1955. I was a member of MU Sigma fraterity Laurelton Chapter. I would like if anyone has heard from Ira Feldman. Thanks Jay\n\nJay Safran Email Address: jaysaf021989@hotmail.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nGreetings Skip:\n\nI hope you guys still post on here. My name is Chris DeWald and I used to live at 139-11 Springfield Blvd. Like others , I remember my phone number. It was Laurelton 5-3789. I was born in Jamaica Hospital. I lived above a Dr's office. His name was Irving Yarvin and my mother was the nurse. I attended St Mary Magdalenes and graduated in 1969. Since I seemed to get stabbed going to school either under the train tressels or by Corseys market, my parents moved to Sag harbor. Anyone remember the duck and cover drills? Someone mentioned the Funeral Home across from Bohacks. My father, William, had his funeral service there. I eventually went into the military and am now retired from civil service in Virginia. Great Web Site. My e-mail addy is dewald55@verizon.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi Skip:\n\nI was two years ahead of you at PS 156, but left Lauralton in January of 1952 and lost touch with everyone I knew. The recollections of my first three and one half years of grammar school are hazy, but I do remember with affection Bruce Zeitlin, Rosemarie Vacarro, and seeing my first movie, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" in the theatre on Merrick Road. I lived on 244th Street. I'd like to donate something to the web site. let me know how to do that.\n\nDennis Greene Email Address: morskajak@comcast.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi Skip,\n\nThank you so much for your website. You enabled lots of people to reconnect. There will be a Jackson reunion from the '60's Mar. 18-22, 2010 on a cruise starting in Miami.\n\nI started thinking of all the things about Laurelton that I loved. It was the parades that happened at the drop of a hat. We had them for Memorial Day, Labor Day, any time a synagogue got a new Torah, the fourth of July. We always met at P.S. 156 and marched all over town stopping at all the churches, synagogues, civic associations and War Veteran posts. It was the four synagogues, the 10 kosher butcher shops. I loved the Jewish Community House. I became a Bat Mitzvah there. I remember the lessons before it. I loved the Friday night services and the junior congregation. I remember getting kicked out for talking on Shabbat mornings and high holidays.\n\nI remember going to Dr. Fine and Dr. Kaveller (spelling?)Dr. Tesch and my husband went to Dr. Robbins. Did anyone else go to them? Does anyone remember the Laurelton Young Adult Group/ATID? We have great memories of it.\n\nDo you remember the bagel place and the appetizing stores? How about Stanley's toy store? What about the movie theater and ice cream store?\n\nI spent summers at 156 playing kickball and nok hockey.\n\nThanks for the memories.\n\nIris Krichefsky (Schachter) Email Address: folkdance@aol.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi---Just found your site and as I was going through it I came upon the street guide and since I lived off Merrick and 227Th, two popular stores came to mind. I think there was the \"Laurel Shoppe\" on the corner of 227th (North side) and next to it a shoe repair shop where the employee worked by the front window and would \"talk to us\". Does anyone remember these stores???? This is a wonderful, wonderful site and I could spend hours just remembering all the great things we had back then.\n\nNaomi Matalon (Dreznin), Class of '63 Email Address: naomimolly@juno.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi Skip,\n\nNice board you're running.\n\nMy name is Peter McGullam, and I lived on 222nd Street near 131st Avenue from 1960 until the late '60s. I have warm memories of friends and teachers from JHS 59 (James Morris, Mr. Buchanan, who got our chorus on the Dave Garroway show, with Harry Belafonte!) and Andrew Jackson High, not to mention the Epiphany Lutheran Church (Rev. Ted Grant, the Graf family, the Smileys; the James Morris family; the Fensterers), Bob Richter, Idan Simowitz (from Jackson). I count as best friends, to this day, Milton Forrest (from Springfield Gardens) and Fred Schultz (from 225th Street; neighbors were the Brede family.\n\nI've had no luck contacting one friend, a few years older (probably born around 1944): George Morgan, whose family lived on 226th Street near 131st Avenue. He moved, I believe, to Nashville around 1970. If anyone on this board remembers him (he had no siblings), I'd appreciate info. If you remember me, drop me a line!\n\nPeter McGullam, Huntington NY Email Address: pmhuntington@gmail.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHello, Skip very interesting and well done site with lots of history. I am trying to track down Kern's Bicycle shop which is referred to as a neighborhood business a couple times on the site. Does anyone know what its location was? I have an address of 1101 W. Broadway, but I don't see any such address in Laurelton (indeed in Queens, except perhaps for 11-01 Broadway in Long Island City). There is an 1101 W. Broadway in Woodmere. Is it possible Kern's Bicycle Shop was there? Thanks,\n\nJim Lawniczak Email Address: ohioencased@roadrunner.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nDear Skip,\n\nI am reading the messages on your site. . .and it's like an acid flash. how many people can remember not only their addresses but their telephone numbers!\n\nI was born in 1944 and we moved to 130-28-225th Street when i was 2 months old. I have no idea what class I would have been in because from the first day of kindergarden I knew I wanted to be nothing so much as a truant! The ITCH! The magnificent \\VALENCIA! MOVIES to learn all about life!\n\nI know Mrs. Flinka was principal (i think my mother bought her 11 thousand chatchkes -- bribes -- so I wouldn't get expelled).\n\nMy friends were judy hertzendorf, joyce sunilla, betty chang (of chang's restaurant). and I remember the schwartz twins, donny and wally? And even though i'd have to look down right now to see what i'm wearing, my telephone number was LA 8 1453.\n\nThat attached house, is still the house in my dreams (although i looked in the window recently and i'd bet the farm that is a functioning house of repute that is ill). And who knew that bernie madoff lived on 228th street? feh.\n\nMy name was Ronni Warren and i'd kill to hear from anyone who is 65 and still alive. What a great and emotionally charged website. Best,\n\nRonni Warren Ashcroft Santa Fe, New Mexico Email Address: RWarrenAsh@aol.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi Skip,\n\nGreat site. But I was wondering. One of the options was PS 38 but nothing was listed. I went to PS 38 from the 6th to 8th grade (1955 to 1958) and then moved to Far Rockaway and graduated from there in 1961. There's such an unusual crossover since kids in Laurelton were given the choice - Andrew Jackson or Far Rock.\n\nI would love to find friends from PS 38 like Annette Gissi (who was my best friend all those years) Lois Boruck, Avis Goldstone, Peter Gamar, Carmine Lanzaro, Barbara Ehrlich (sp?), Joel Weinstein, Ruth Sohlberg (sp?), Linda Pearson and many others whose names elude me now.\n\nI lived at 131-12 234th Street. My brother also went to PS 38 but he is three years behind me. His name is Robert Mirsky, AKA Butchie. I now live in Santa Barbara, CA and my named is Eileen Barish, nee Mirsky. Maybe there are some old friends living in California. But I'd like to hear from any of you. Thanks for this posting.\n\nRegards,\n\nEileen Barish Email Address: eileeneo@earthlink.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi,\n\nI lived in laurelton in the 40's thru 60's. i lived on 232 st off merrick road. My memory is waning with the years but some of my happiest years were spent there. There is a site that is trying to make a store map of these times and there are a few things i can add. I went to bassos deli where they were yankee fans and listened to a cleveland yankee game there. We also bought our christmas trees from basso and i remember fondly we as a family walked it home and mom made us hot chocalate with marshmellows. Something not mentioned was across merrick road from 232 was a tomato farm with horses and we played ball there and picked tomatoes. Later stores were added and no one mentions this lot or farm. There was a haberdasher store there owned by my next door neighbor and a chinese restaurant where i would get a 60 cent lunch paid for by my press route which I had running the length of 232 street 98 papers i was never so rich again.\n\nI was an acquaintence of jacky kerns and remember his father a jovial looking character who i felt was always in his cups. My good friend was charlie sterry whose father owned sterrys bar where we would go and listen to him sing vaudeville and irish songs while playing the drum sticks on a wooden piece of bar. My bedroom was on the ground level and I would often hear mr sterry whistling at night walking home after the close of his bar for the night. I went to ps 156 and then on to woodrow wilson hs while most went to andrew jackson. Since the city bars closed early we would often go to bars in nassau like the trees lounge in valley stream which I believe was made famous years later by steve buschemi. We would sometimes go to tony's and get a 60 cent small pizza which I could eat myself. My brother worked for a while in the italian shoemaker mentioned and always hated that the guy would spit on the floor. When I walked to the movie I passed a chinese restaurant that had a beautiful fish tank with some kind of small eel looking fish that would come out from hiding every so often. As a kid I was fascinated by it. Inside they had flags and posters of free china during the war. Everyone was patriotic and many windows had blue stars in them.\n\nI remember there was a canteen around the corner along merrick road that I was too young to enter at the time but remembered the teenagers hanging out at. I remember vj day when everyone went up to merrick road and the streets were jammed with celebration. Iremember trudging thru knee high snow in the blizzard of 47 i think, to ps 156. Schools were not closed for snow in the city.\n\nMore thoughts float in and out but that's all II can do for now. Keep up the memories. Keep up the good work. Fondly,\n\nRich Nocella Email Address: richardncll@yahoo.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for the wonderful site. I'm a Laurelton resident. It has come to my attention that Bernie Madoff spent his childhood years here. Would anyone be able to tell me a bit more about this? His father's name was Ralph Madoff. Thank you,\n\nDee Email Address: ldb11413@netscape.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nSkip:\n\nThanks a big bunch for keeping this web site up. It allowed Tom Smith to find me a few months ago and last month when my wife Liz and I were in Palm Beach, FL on vacation:\n\n1. We contacted and visited Warren Colozzo and his wife Adele. Warren and I had not seen each other since our grade school graduation June, 1949 - almost 60 years ! We both are fine and reminisced an entire afternoon away. Warren is retired after a career as a professional roller-skater (it all started at the Elmont Rink after WW II, owner of some roller rinks, PanAm, and then the Palm Beach County police.\n\n2. The next day we visited with Ada Mae \"Bunny\" Wayne, married name Weinberg. Unfortunately Bunny's husband died last year. She is permanently down in Del Ray Beach now, after leaving Chicago. Two children, two grandchildren. Another visit packed with laughs.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul S. Frommer, PS-156 Class of 1949 Email Address: frommerclu@comcast.net\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nIt's a small world! Tonight I was at a party in Simi Valley California. A girl asked me what part of NY I was from, the accent is so recognizable! I said Queens she asked where, I said Laurelton, she looked at me and said her parents owned the Jewish Deli on Merrick and Francis Lewis!!!! Unbelievable! I spent many a wonderful lunch and dinner there! We enjoyed talking about the old neighborhood. Back then she lived in Valley Stream, but the restaurant was in Laurelton, next door was that little Italian pastry shop. I e mailed her the web site and I hope she enjoys reading all about Laurelton memories. Thanks\n\nDonna (Maller) Dawson Email Address: donnasue10@mac.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nRecently found the Laurelton web site. Lot's of fun going back in time, and stirring up old memories. My name is Laurie Kerner Beller, I graduated Andrew Jackson in 1964, was very active in Sing. I lived in Rosedale, but most of my friends were Laureltonians. I went to a 60's reunion a number of years ago. First a tour of the school, and then in the evening , an event at Huntington Town House. I thought it was very disorganized, and it was hard to connect with people. Hopefully at some point there will be another. Jackson was such a large school, it was hard to have a one on one at the function. The Town House is huge, and the affair was a bit disorganized. If anyone is out there from this time frame, please respond. Thank you, L.\n\nLaurie Kerner Beller Email Address: Firstmate428@aol.com\n\nOctober 30, 2009\n\nThe Store Map---1950's early 60's:\n\nDilbert's was a grocery store on the North side of Merrick, I think between 226th and 227th- not between 230th and FSB. My older brother Barry worked there for a time. It was owned by a local family who had a son about our age-cannot recall his name now. They later opened a branch in Rockville Center. I think Dilberts was on the same block--if not next door--as Handler's Candy Store--owned by parents of Sigma Phi, Alpha Pi brother Artie Handler, also his younger (??) brother Howie. They lived behind the store and we spent hours hanging out there. Right around the corner on 226th Street was Tom's barber shop.\n\nA door or two west of the Laurelton Theatre was also a barber shop opened by a barber who once worked at Tom's and struck out on his own--I can see his face but cannot remember his name. Very handsome distinguished looking guy with perfectly coiffed gray hair. The beauty parlor on that block was owned by the Myer's family--their son Barry is one of ours. I think he lives somewhere in Fla. now.\n\nI also worked at the Busy Bee, along with lots of others (Stan Officina, Larry Frank, etc.)--Northeast corner of FSB & Merrick across from the Ridgewood Bank--behind the counter as a soda jerk and short order cook and \"making\" the weekend newspapers (loved it--everyone in the world came in sooner or later--to grab a an egg cream, cherry coke, lime ricky, malted, ice cream, milk shake, burger, fries and chat, then hung out on the corner in front, just like in legend, plotting their next move, waiting to see and be seen and doing \"Doo-Wopp\" under the street light). I remember other stores on that block did include the 4 Star bakery and a kosher sit down deli--can't remember the name and, of course, Stanley's toy store and hobby shop on the corner of 230th Street. Remember the owner so well. Kindly guy with dark hair. Heard he was killed in a robbery there a long time ago. Anyone have confirmation or details of that rumor??? I think there was a travel agency next door to the Ridgewood Savings Bank.\n\nAnd who can forget Mulvaney's Tavern. Hate to admit how many wasted nights there were on that shuffle board machine, drinking beer and whatever after a long day at one of the local race tracks or a hard day of poker games. Gosh, some of us were real bums, weren't we??\n\nOn corner of 231st Street and Merrick---Northwest side on the corner was indeed Korn's where we bought all our Boy Scout gear, baseball mitts, jeans and khaki pants. Next to that-towards FSB I think was some kind of furniture store. Then Dial Drug Store owned by ????--where Michael Ginsberg and I think, Larry Frank. worked as a delivery boys.\n\nAcross the street, near Capri, was Feldman's Butcher Shop, an old fashion biz with saw dust on the floor where I worked awhile for a buck an hour and nickel tips as a delivery boy--on a broken down old bike with a huge basket. Also worked as a bus boy at Capri. Mamma used to fix the greatest dinners\n\nfor the waiters, bus boys and kitchen staff every night before the dinner crowd came in. Terrific. Never had it better!!\n\nGosh, what age does to you. Took for granted I would remember with precision all those places and people forever. Now, cannot dredge it all up without help. Anyone???\n\nStephen A.

Whenever I watch the movie Sunset Boulevard I have flashbacks of her!\n\nMaralin Feldman (Falik) Email Address: maralin@voteess.com\n\nOctober 30. 2009\n\nSkip,\n\nGood old Laurelton and Springfield Gardens. I graduated from St. Mary Magdalenes in 1957. When I was 14, I worked in the Laurelton Bagel Bakery. It was before they opened the retail store. The only way to get to it was down the alley behind Wong's Garden on the corner of 225th Street. Carmines Pizza was on the southwest corner of 227th Street, on the same block as the movies. A slice of pizza was 15 cents and a soda was 10 cents. You would get it in a cone shaped paper cup with a metal base.\n\nWe tried to save some money in the Ridgewood Savings Bank, on the southwest corner of Merrick Road and Francis Lewis Boulevard. It was always cool inside. You had to be on good behavior because Mr. Gatty, the tall thin security guard would be watching you through those black framed eye glasses. When it was your turn, you would give your green pass book to Mr. Quinn, the cashier. You gave him some money and he would write the amount in the big book and in your pass book. Then stamp it with the ink pad. Besides normal saving accounts, we had special \"Christmas Club\" accounts, where we would save money all year and take it out in December to buy Christmas presents.\n\nIt looks like a number of people walked many of the same streets in good old Laurelton and Springfield Gardens. I grew up at 231-18-129th Ave. It was about four blocks north of Merrick Road, two doors off Francis Lewis Boulevard. Casual Clothes was on the north side of Merrick Road, between FSB and 231st Street. Mr. Silvers candy store was on the north west corner of 225th Street. If it was Saturday, (movie day) back in 1957. I would be heading up FSB, first past the little record store and the barber shop and then past the luncheonette on the corner. First it was called Pollicks, then it was Lil Eds, then Bert and Daves. I would then head west on Merrick Road, past Safrans Kosher Deli, ( checking out the hot dogs permanently being grilled in the window.) Then past Stanleys Toy store on the corner of 230 St. One more block to Woolworths, ( going in one door, past the soda machine, and out the other door. Cross the street and another block.\n\nFirst stopping at Raabs to meet up with the gang. Also to check and see if anyone had one of those colored flyers the movie gave out. If you matched the color with the one hanging up in the ticket booth, you got in for free. Never in my life did I ever get one. Now to the candy store to get some treats for the show. You never got any in the theater, it was way to expensive. Now past Wedgewood Studio and we are at the itch. The affectionate name for the Laurelton Theater.\n\nLets see, the theater had a marques that overhung the sidewalk. The ticket booth was on the left. You bought your ticket and went through the glass doors. Up the inclined vestibule to the one open door where they collected the tickets, (usually all the way on the right). Now, on the right were the seats. The first section was the smoking section, then the large middle section and then on to the childrens section. The Matron made you go to the childrens section.\n\nOn the left was the soda machine then the candy counter. The Bon Bons and other ice creams were on the left, then the candies and then the popcorn. The popcorn was never fresh popped; it came in large plastic bags that were stored in the room to the left of the screen, in front of the childrens section. Then it was put in the glass box with one light bulb to heat up the popcorn. Ten cents for a bag. To the right of the candy stand was the door to get into the stand, then the water fountain, then the large stairway upstairs.\n\nUpstairs was a long hallway. Nothing on the right side. On the left was first the girls bathroom, then Mr. Bells office, (the manager), then the projection room, with the bright arc lights of the projector and large metal containers the film came in. Walter Nathan was the projectionist. He had two sons, Alan and David. Finally the boys bathroom all the way at the end.\n\nNow if you really wanted a treat, take the Q5 bus into Jamaica and walk down Jamaica Avenue to the Valencia Theater. What a grand place that was, with the suits of armor, ceiling full of clouds and stars and an upstairs balcony. Dont forget the pond full of gold fish. After the movie you walked down to the end of the block, made a right, then a half a block to the bus terminal. If you had any money left, you played a couple of games in the arcade at the terminal. Then outside to catch the Q5 bus that took you back to Laurelton.\n\nBill Lederer Email Address: lederer123@optonline.net\n\nJuly 12, 2009\n\nI was searching the internet for a vendor in Laurelton and I stumbled across the Laurelton website. I grew up in Laurelton, went to 156 and 231 and then off to Jamaica High School. I went to 156 in the early 80's. Also was in the girl scouts for years at the Good Lutheran. I have recently moved to Bellerose, but one thing has remained consistent my place of worship. You know it as the old Laurelton Theater, but from the age of 8 I have attended this church. It kept me off the streets, and I've learned so much at this ministry. God blessed us last year to renovate the building from the middle of 227th to the end of the block (use to be Gordon's photographers). Would love for you to stop by to see the renovation at our Street Festival, Saturday, July 18th, 12:00-6:00pm (flyers attached).\n\nI'm just a proud member that grew up in this neighborhood and love my church and after I saw all of the reflections down memory lane, just wanted to give you an update.\n\nSophia Bryan Email Address: sophiabryan@hotmail.com\n\nMarch 17, 2009\n\nSadly, I cannot claim to be a \"landsman\" from your hometown. I came across your site and was so intrigued by the number of people who took the time to reminisce about growing up in Laurelton that I printed out 23 pages of the individual comments from people.\n\nReading these items I was impressed by the main theme: the school that all remembered. I suppose the reason this was noted is that I am a retired school principal and some 15 years after leaving the classroom, I still have a lot of the teacher in me. When I read how many remembered their teacher with love and appreciation I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. Hey, I too am a teacher as if this would let me also reap some of the affection even if only by association.\n\nThe mention of Jewish classes brought memories of my going three times a week to our local chader. There was no mentioning of the darn hard work preparing for bar mitzva. One or two mentioned the synagogue and how one is now a church. Here too one of the oldest synagogues was sold to a church group and here too the Mogen David was left in place.\n\nThe snarly store keeper had a counterpart here for there were some stores that welcomed the big penny and nickel spenders while other stores were shunned by us.\n\nAs a matter of fact I have been assembling a printed record of my growing up in Ottawa which in many respects resembled your town and indeed every town that is remembered how it was 60-70 years ago. Time kindly erases many of the things that at the time they took place, seemed to be very unfair, terrible and never-ending.\n\nI have a wonderful wife; we'll be 53 years married in August. Our daughter is a Family Doctor and she has two daughters who are the pride and joy of their Bubby and Zaideh.\n\nI do have an active hobby that I started only a while back. I collect pins and so if anyone reading this wants to be kind to a Canadian reader of Skip's Web Site, a pin from your city, town or whatever will be terrific ! With best wishes for a continued success in this project' There is a Jewish comment that is applicable here: Yasher Koach!\n\nJoe (Zaideh) Murray - jmrry@rogers.com\n\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJanuary 17, 2009\n\nSkip,\n\nI enjoyed your site very much, it brought back fond memories. We moved to Laurelton in 1953, when I was 7. We first lived in the garden apts. I don't remember the address Then we moved to 130 -?- 223St. I went to St. Mary Magdalene's and graduated in 1960. I remember Mr. Silver's candy store on the corner of 224 or 225 Street, the library where I loved to go into Adult area where I could curl up in a big leather chair and read.\n\nGoing to the movies on Saturday and being there for 2 features, cartoons, newsreel and coming attractions. I never heard of it being called the \"itch. Their was a great Jewish deli near Francis Lewis Blvd. I remember getting the best Sundae at the soda shop at the corner of Frances Lewis Blvd. and down from there on FLB was a record shop. There also was a clothing store around there called \"Casual\"\n\nWe used to fish in Twin Ponds with bamboo poles and we used worms to fish with. There were always these beautiful gold fish in the ponds, but of course we never caught one. In the winter we would ice skate at Twin Ponds. We too would walk to Green Acres and when I was older we'd go to the Sunrise Drive In.\n\nIt was a great place grow up. All the kids on the block, boys and girls, would play punch ball, stick ball, touch football. Having parties in someone's basement. It was great place to grow up.\n\nWe moved from Laurelton in 1970 and I always missed living there.\n\nLynn Kiely Email Address: kielygrp@valstar.net\n\nJanuary 17, 2009\n\nHi Skip, I lived in Laurelton from 1948 to 1967. I am fascinated with the recent Bernie Madoff story and its Laurelton connection. Does anyone know where Bernie lived and went to school? The only Laureltonites I keep up with now are my siblings and a few woman I went to JHS 59 with. The rest are all wonderful memories. Thanks if you know any info about Madoff. I am just very curious because someone said he lived near my house on 229th street and I don't remember him.Thanks,\n\nSue Delson Fass Email Address: hsfass@verizon.net\n\nJanuary 17, 2009\n\nDear Skip\n\nI just discovered your website and boy what memories are there. I was born at Jamacia Hospital (the one that has been torn down) and raised at 131-66 222nd Street. We were the only Chinese family besides the Chang's who owned the House of Chang on Merrick Blvd and also in Valley Stream. Two doors down was a kid named Bobby who was mentally challenged but was great. He would stand next to a great Maple tree all day long watching us. Next door to me were the Kopetski's and upstairs were the Mauceri's. On the other side were the Grace's and across the street were the Anderson's. On the corner were the Lenihan's. Around the corner were the LoMaglio's (Phyllis, Judy and MaryJane). We all grew up together. Some of us went to St. Mary Magdellan's; the others went to public school. Tragedy did strike the Lenihan's as their oldest daughter Mary Ellen was killed hitchhiking to D.C. back in 1969.\n\nI remember getting the mail at the post office for my Dad every day during the summer. Dad and I used to walk past the bagel store and go to the local pizzeria. 25 cents bought you a slice with soda and then we would go next door for a cherry ice. Don't remember the names of these places but do have those nice memories. Woolworth was my favorite store to do some Xmas shopping and Bohack's supermarket was right on the corner of 222nd Street. There was a funeral parlor right across the street from there too as I recall. My dentist was Dr. Desiderio and his son, Mark went to St. Mary Magdellan's with me. Hope some of the old gang reads this. Please email me. Would love to hear from you.\n\nPauline Email address: sihyan628@aol.com\n\nNovember 30, 2008\n\nHello Skip;\n\nI'd like to share my Laurelton Experience\n\nI grew up on 217 and 131st ave, about 1/2 block off Springfield Blvd. My phone number was LA7-7487. I went to St. Mary Madeline Catholic School until they shut their doors in '73. I then went to p.s. 132 but after getting into a few scuffles, my mother had me and my brothers bussed to p.s. 188 in Kingsbury. I then attended JHS 172 then Martin Van Buren in Queens Village where I graduated in '84.\n\nI do recall going to the movie house in Merrick Road many times. My parents would drop us off on Sat afternoon I think so they can spend some time alone. The major feature would be preempted with a Bug Bunny cartoon. I can't remember all the movies but Willard (yuck) and Jaws is what sticks out the most.\n\nI recall Twin Ponds bakery. The candy store on Merrick road where we would get candy necklaces and whistle pops, Keyfood on 225 and Merrick, the bike shop, Ridgewood Savings bank on 229 (I think) where I had my very first, passbook savings account, and Woolworth five and dime are the places I recall the most. I've always loved to walk and made many foot trips to Green Acres, Woolworth's, the movies and friends homes. Today I live in FL and unfortunately the only walking around here is from the front door to the car or for leisure.\n\nA dark moment in Laurelton;\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew an African American paperboy in Laurelton named Ricky, (don't know his last name). He was about 11 or 12 in 1972 when he was hit by a car while riding his bike to deliver papers. He used to hang around my older brothers and of all their friends, was the nicest to me. I was very young and although I really liked him, I didn't know too much about him. I was wondering if anyone here also knew of him or kept in touch with his family. Any information would be great.\n\nDoes anyone recall, the O'Leary's (John, Rose, Teresa, Cathleen and Timmy) the Vetirosa's (sp?), (Annette, Diane, Billy), Nepaletano's (Kevin, Frances, Kathleen, Danny, David), Linda Taylor, or the O'Mara's?\n\nIt's great walking down memory lane.\n\nCarolyn Gallagher Email Address: sohoyank@yahoo.com\n\nAugust 3, 2008\n\nHI Skip,\n\nI came to the Laurelton sight just by chance and enjoyed very much reading about the beautiful town. I work in Valley Stream and often pass through Laurelton and Rosedale. My dad, Ray, opened Dairy Mart, at 230-04 Merrick Blvd in December 1952, (LA 8-9557). It was between 230th Street and Francis Lewis Blvd, second store from the corner of 230th. The dairy and appetizing store had the best pickled lox and catering in town. My dad even candled his own eggs in the back room for a long time. There were two great high school students working for him over the years...Marsha and Moose (Ronnie).Those two taught me how to run the register and from time to time I helped out in the store. It was always fun.\n\nDad and Shep used to buy overstock containers to pack their appetizing in. I remember one time a customer asking for some more of the delicious pineapple ice cream, that turned out to be frozen potato salad.\n\nDad stayed there for over 10 years and then moved on, but made some everlasting friends. His partner at that time was Sheppy who stayed in the Laurelton location for a while longer until he was held up and robbed. He later closed Dairy Mart to open Sheppy's of Merrick. By the way, the Dairy Mart name was never changed to Sheppy's.\n\nThe store next door to Dairy Mart was Utopia Kosher Meats, and there was a Paint store directly next door on the other side, right on the corner, for awhile.\n\nYou have my permission to contact me and include this in the Laurelton sight, if interested.\n\nJudy Email Address: JudyS618@aol.com\n\nAugust 3, 2008\n\nDear Skip,\n\nMany thanks for your kind words about my memoir. I have been reading all the Laurelton web sites with much pleasure and I think I can add some information to some of the queries about the Laurelton movie theater. I moved to Laurelton in 1931 when I was 10 years old. At that time my parents did not think I was old enough to go to the movies. (How things have changed!) I began to go to Saturday matinees (double feature, cartoons, and a \"chapter\") when I was 13 (1933-1934) so the date 1932 for the building of the theater may very well be correct. The admission price was ten cents. There was never an organ (only fancy palaces like the Valencia in Jamaica had organs), there was always a \"matron\" in a white uniform to keep order, there was a small stage behind the screen (my sister Sena vouches for this), and you could stay all day and watch the whole program over again if your mother didn't send somebody to get you out of there!\n\nThe Laurelton Theatre was already known to us as \"the Itch\" and I would like to say something about that. Like many slang terms the origin of this usage\n\nis unknown, so people make up plausible explanations (like the programs were so long you were itching to get out, etc) which then become what language scholars call \"folk etymology.\" I have not been able to find out anything about this usage from any of the sources I presently have available to me. If someone does know of a slang dictionary or a book of English usage that has some information I would be really happy to know of it (English is my\n\nhobby, as you have probably already figured out).\n\nLaurelton was not the only theatre to be known by that name. It was part of a chain of small neighborhood theaters in Queens and Nassau County, some of whom were also known as \"the Itch.\" I was once visiting a small town in upstate New York and heard someone refer to their neighborhood theater as\n\n\"the Itch,\" so apparently it is (or was) a slang term for any small neighborhood theater, used to distinguish it from any large, expensive movie palace.\n\nAnd now for the good stuff! The OWNERS of the Laurelton Theatre and the chain of which it was a part LIVED IN LAURELTON. They were two families\n\nnamed Kerner and Baker; I believe they were brothers-in-law. I did not know them personally, but I did know their three handsome sons, Marvin and Arnold Kerner and Stewart (Stewie) Baker, who were local heart throbs not only because of their good looks but because of the ineffable glamour of their\n\n\"Hollywood\" connection and also because if you were good friends of theirs they could get you into \"the Itch\" for free! Sadly, that never happened to\n\nme.\n\nAnnette Landau Email Address: ahlandau@dslextreme.com\n\nAugust 1, 2008\n\nThank you so much for the Laurelton page! I went to P.S. 156 from 1962-1965 for the 4,5 and 6th grades. I've happily reconnected with one classmate\n\nand would welcome hearing from others who had Mrs. Schwartz, Miss Trustey and Mrs. Parver.\n\nLezli White Email Address: lezli@artfarm.com\n\nJuly 17, 2008\n\nHello Skip,\n\nThis is truly a wonderful website. Thank you Skip. My memories of Laurelton (156 class of '63?) include many of those already mentioned. I lived a few houses behind Stanley's (230th and 133rd) and remember well the store, \"Stanley\" and the fire.\n\nIn perusing the memories already posted I did not find any about \"Twin Ponds.\" I remember going with my friends \"fishing\" at Twin Ponds - a ridiculous notion since no fish could possibly live in these fetid waters. However that did not stop us. We took crude fishing poles (bamboo sticks with some string and a wire hook) but did not use bait since there was nothing to catch. We sat and waited for what I do not know. Eventually we \"caught\" up some weeds from the bottom of the pond, called it a great catch and walked home.\n\nAlso, no one ever mentioned Schultzie's candy store on 228th and Merrick or the candy/malt shop at Francis Lewis and Merrick. Was that Dave and somethings? Burt and Dave's maybe? Help me someone!\n\nI have a fifth grade class picture circa 1961 of Ms Miller's class at 156. I will dig it out and submit it to you for inclusion on the site.\n\nKeep up the great work.\n\nArt Weiss (AJHS '68) Email Address: weiss60@msn.com\n\nJuly 17, 2008\n\nHello Skip,\n\nMy name is Larry Schwarz and I live in South Jordan, Utah( a bedroom suburb of salt lake city) I just discovered the Laurelton website. I lived in Laurelton as a very young boy from birth in 1952 to fall 1958. We lived at 130-28 229th street. I have very fond memories of those years. The house we lived in was actually owned by my grandmother. As my grandmother was getting ill in the late 1950s she sold the house as she needed the money for her care. My parents wanted a house of their own so we moved to North Woodmere.\n\nI remember Woolworths, Raabs lunchonette, The jewish deli, Schultzes candy store, Marders pharmacy, Teddys lunchonette. Many memories. My grandmother was Elizabeth Urdang, and my parents were Charles and Geraldine Schwarz. I don't know if these names ring a bell. On a recent trip to New York I rented a car and drove down 229th street. Laurelton is still a very well kept up neighborhood.\n\nI would like to help, share my memories with others. If there is a reunion I would try to fly in for it. I also remember a little ice cream stand at the corner of Merrick rd and the cross Island. I think it was actually in Rosedale. My father took my brother and I there for ice cream often. It was loud as it was right under the landing approach to Idewild ( now known as jfk).\n\nPlease let me know if I can do anything. Finding that website, what a pleasant stroll down memory lane. By the way, is it possible somehow to go into the house at 130-28 229th street ( with current owners permission of course) I would love to see the house again. I have very vivid memories still and even after all these years could describe the layout of the house. Best Regards,\n\nLarry Schwarz Email Address: lahaldo@hotmail.com\n\nJuly 17, 2008\n\nDear Skip,\n\nIf you ever decide to have a contest for the oldest memoirs I am probably in danger of winning it. My name is Annette Henkin Landau. I moved to Laurelton in 1931 when I was 10 years old. (All you geniuses from PS 156 can do the arithmetic yourselves.) I lived at 226-31 Mentone Ave. with my parents (Ben and Bess Henkin) and my siblings, Howard and Sena (now Blatman). Our cousins, the Goldbergs (Lenore, Irwin, Joel) lived next door. Our houses were (and still are) attached to each other but not to anyone else. We all went to PS 156. I remember the Principal, Mr.Joseph Baron, Mrs.Hedderman, Mrs. McArthur, Mrs. Weinberger, Mrs.David, Ms.Vaillant, Ms. Mulhall, Ms. Merriam, & the Domestic Science teacher, Ms.McKay. I graduated in 1933, went to Jamaica H.S. (Andrew Jackson did not yet exist), and graduated in the first graduating class of Queens College in 1941. I grew up to be an English teacher, a librarian, a sometimes published writer, and a mother of three.\n\nI married Philip Landau in 1942. He lived at 227-04 138th Ave., went to Far Rockaway High School and NYU. He died in 1987 after having famously managed he Sherry-Netherland Hotel in Manhattan for 35 years.\n\nSome time in the 1980's New York magazine ran a contest about growing up in New York neighborhoods. I submitted an article called \"Growing Up American: Laurelton in the 1930's.\" It got an honorable mention. I always thought I had had a magical childhood in Laurelton (I am so pleased that so many other Laureltonians did too), and I still like the article, so I am attaching it\n\nto this letter in hopes that you won't think it too long for the Laurelton website. (It runs about 6 pages, but it does concern material that seems not to have appeared before.)\n\nI moved to California a few months ago and would be happy to hear from Laureltonians past, present, and future.\n\nAnnette Henkin Landau Email Address: ahlandau@dslextreme.com\n\nJuly 17, 2008\n\nHi,\n\nI came to the Laurelton site just by chance and enjoyed very much reading about the beautiful town. My dad, Ray, opened Dairy Mart, at 230-04 Merrick Blvd about December 1952. It was between 230th Street and Francis Lewis Blvd. The dairy and appetizing store had the best pickled lox, herring and catering in town. My dad even candled his own eggs in the back room for a long time. Dad stayed there for over 10 years and then moved on, but made some everlasting friends. His partner at that time was Sheppy who stayed in the Laurelton location for a while longer until he opened Sheppy's of Merrick. The store next door to Dairy Mart was Utopia Kosher Meats, and there was a Paint store next door on the corner of Merrick and 230th Street, for awhile. I lived and still work in Valley Stream. I often run into friends and keep in touch with family who grew up and remember Laurelton and will be delighted to visit this website.\n\nJudy Email Address: JudyS618@aol.com\n\nApril 20, 2008\n\nHi Skip,\n\nI am a Laurelton girl from the 50s. Actually my parents moved to Laurelton in1946 when I was one year old. I have a younger sister named Andrea. We lived at 130-12 220th street. Our phone no. was LA 5-3331. We went to PS132. Lots of kids went to 132 from Laurelton. But we were from the edge of Laurelton, not the middle like most of the other bloggers. I remember Mrs. Flinker the principal. My teachers were Mrs. Shapiro, Mrs. Fleck, Mrs. Barruco, Mrs. Powell, Mrs. Donahue and Mrs. Hart who shared my fourth grade year because Mrs. Donahue went on a lengthy well earned vacation. My favorite of all was Mrs. Ganz, my fifth grade teacher. She must be a bright light on the other side of the veil because she loved us all so much.\n\nMy class was the first to ever go to JHS 59 as seventh graders. We spent the first quarter of that school year at PS 132 and then we were moved into the brand new school. Does anyone remember Mr. Haber? He was the girls' heartthrob. I also loved Mr. Austern, Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Ross who was energetic and funny and made history come alive. My mom sent me to The Mary Louis Academy after 59 because she was afraid that I was too shy for Andrew Jackson.\n\nOkay so here were the Merrick Rd. stores from my end of Laurelton. We had Bob's delicatessen with the best potato salad I ever ate. Our pharmacy was Nemo's which had a cubbyhole in it where your taxes could be paid. We had a little bitty Bohack, a butcher in a separate building, a Chinese laundry and a candy store where we bought birthday presents and our school supplies.\n\nSomeone said there was no Catholic church in Laurelton. On our end, we went to St. Mary Magdalene. Was that not considered Laurelton? That's where we made our communion and were confirmed. Indeed, most of my classmates were Jewish so on the Jewish holidays, there were only three or four kids in each classroom. Shortly after, the Jewish fall holidays were made into school holidays which made a lot of sense.\n\nMy friends on our end were Linda and Sheila Heifetz, Patricia and Anna Mary Mechella, Geraldine Hertzberg, Lynn and Barbara Hochman, Kenneth Messina and Cynthia Brody. I knew Steven Taub and his sister Linda but they moved in the second wave. The Girardi boys were Charlie and Freddy. Carol Ann Smiley and her brother Johnny lived nearby. Diane DiPaolo and her big sister Marie Ann lived across the street.\n\nFunny how I can remember things from long ago but I can't remember where my glasses are today. Blessings and good luck to all the wonderful people of Laurelton. I live in Las Cruces, New Mexico now, where the streets have names, not numbers, and the kids never go outside to play.\n\nCheryl Avanzino Tomlin Email Address: cheryljean777@yahoo.com\n\nApril 20, 2008\n\nHello,\n\nI'm Arthur Goldstein (Otto).
