        "text": "A new Locher Room was published to YouTube today, Wednesday, June 3, which has Guiding Light’s Justin Deas, Frank Dicopoulos, John Driscoll, Beth Ehlers, and Fiona Hutchison. Their characters were Buzz Cooper, Frank Cooper, Coop Bradshaw, Harley Cooper, and Jenna Bradshaw.\n\nI have not yet watched. But, I do appreciate these videos—the discussions—as well.\n\nIt’s my favorite of the reunions Alan has put together so far and I highly recommend watching it. Justin Deas proves he’s still the life of the party! Of course, leave it to Beth Ehlers – true to form as the model participant (can we expect anything less?!) – to honor its theme (“Cocktails with the Coopers”) and be the only one to actually drink out of a cocktail glass! What struck me most was that after all these years, the same spirit of camaraderie within the group still exists, which is what always made their portrayal of the Cooper clan so very special. How wonderful too, with the timing of the reunion, that John Driscoll could take part just before his upcoming deployment. The impressions Frank shared about those memorable scenes between Justin and Michael Zaslow gave me a good chuckle. And loved how Fiona Hutchison (who still looks as regal as ever!) complemented Beth for being such a good listener, which is so hard to come by in the acting world; her call for more attentive listening is an invaluable tool for not only any actor but a skill I’m sure we could all benefit from, especially during these trying times.\n\nBeth’s next project where she’ll be starring in a podcast sounds really promising and, even if she can only take on roles in a limited capacity due to the time and workload constraints of her main Public Office job, I’m just so excited she’s foraying back into acting again!\n\nIt’s my favorite of the reunions Alan has put together so far and I highly recommend watching it. Justin Deas … Beth Ehlers … John Driscoll …\n\nIt was good.\n\nI also like The Locher Room’s June 10 program welcoming Guiding Light’s Mark Derwin (who played A.C. Mallet from 1990 to 1993), Morgan Englund (who played Dylan Lewis from early-1989 to early-1995), Melissa Hayden (who played Bridget Reardon from 1991 to 1997 and won an Emmy in 1994), Jocelyn Seagrave (who played Mallet’s sister Julie Camaletti from 1991 to 1994), and Kimberley Simms (who played Dylan’s sister Mindy Lewis from 1989 to 1992).\n\nEach of them were interesting.\n\nI was big into CBS’s Guiding Light when they were on particularly with the 1991–92 television season. That season was personally my favorite of any soap’s since I started watching regularly in 1984. (Simms left GL in June 1992 because she and the series did not reach terms for renewal of her contract.)\n\nMelissa Hayden was most interesting to me, in that Locher Room, because of some of her background. That, during her childhood, she was trained for dancing and was in the musical films Pennies from Heaven and the screen adaptation of Annie. They were 1981 and 1982 pictures directed by Herbert Ross (four years after he directed two acclaimed 1977 films, The Goodbye Girl and The Turning Point, and was Oscar-nominated for Best Director for the latter) and the legendary John Huston (1948 Oscar winning Best Director of Treasure of the Sierra Madre; with his last acclaimed film having been 1985’s Prizzi’s Honor for which he directed daughter Anjelica Huston to her Oscar). That fact that Hayden worked with those directors—in films starring likewise great actors Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters and Albert Finney and Carol Burnett—was really remarkable. I had forgotten about that, for a while, and was glad to be reminded of it by Alan Locher and Melissa Hayden.\n\nNow, one person I would like to see on The Locher Room, from GL’s first half of the 1990s, is three-time Emmy winner Rick Hearst. Having watched some YouTube-published episodes of GL, from the 1990s, I have an even greater appreciation with what Hearst did with that role of Alan–Michael Spaulding. I would like to see Hearst and Sonia Satra—who played Lucy Cooper—as guests. Perhaps Frank Beaty, who was terrific in the crazy storyline (Brent/Marian), could be invited as well. (Beaty was nominated for an Emmy in 1996.) The only thing I don’t like with suggesting this is that, perhaps, one or two or all three of them may not really want this. You can never assume anything. These reunions can be a bit spooky to some people—that there are people who do not want to meet up and reminisce about a past part of their lives from a generation or so ago. (I graduated from high school 31 years ago. I never looked, while in the year 2019, to see if there was any possible class reunion. So, I do understand this. But, there is no harm in expressing this interest.)\n\nHow sweet that the compass still carries special meaning for both Maura and Michael (and he even keeps his close by on his nightstand!). It was especially interesting hearing about the process that went into prepping for scenes together and how Michael feels he became a better actor through his working with Maura. Love how they’d even run lines with each other in the car over the phone when stuck in traffic or during a slow commute (now that’s commitment!). How wonderful it’d be to see both actors paired up again on a future project!\n\nI really enjoyed last Wednesday’s The Writers Episode. It was so fascinating hearing about the decisions that go into the stories that are told (and those that don’t make it onto the canvas!) and which particular storylines have defined or left a lasting impact on the lives of the writers themselves."
