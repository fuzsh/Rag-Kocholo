        "text": "The Work of Remembering\n\nNick Richardson\n\n“Memory is not only a source of information about the past but also a force in creating the future.”\n\n~sociologist Karen Fields, “What One Cannot Remember Mistakenly”\n\nBlack history is American history. It intertwines with the histories of all who call America home. With renewed knowledge of our country’s past, numerous Americans have mobilized in recent years to spotlight racial disparities, to challenge accepted historical narratives, and to celebrate Black life. The Festival continues that work this summer by sharing the story of Mary Cardwell Dawson.\n\nWe invite you to remember – or perhaps to learn anew – the ongoing history of Black opera with the sources below.\n\nFurther Reading on the Web\n\nThe home of the National Negro Opera Company will live on. The large Victorian house in Pittsburgh that once served as its headquarters fell into disrepair, but earlier this year owner Jonnet Solomon received a $500,000 grant to revive it. Find out the plans for the future of this historic site in Opera News, and see how Denyce Graves is involved in its restoration in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The house also has its own website with a timeline and a profile of Cardwell Dawson.\n\nA great opera company needs great singers, and the NNOC had major stars on its roster. Soprano Lillian Evanti made a splash as Violetta in the NNOC production of La traviata, performing the role in her own English translation for an audience of 12,000. She had a celebrated career in Europe, becoming the first African-American to perform for a major European opera company (in the title role of Lakmé) before returning home to the U.S. to break down racial barriers. Learn more about her trailblazing life in these profiles from the D.C. History Center and The Washington Post. But don’t just take their word for it – The White House Historical Association has a review of one of Evanti’s concerts from 1932.\n\nYou don’t have to travel far to see memorabilia from the National Negro Opera Company; in fact, you can see some artifacts from wherever you access the internet. Peruse the digital archives of the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Community Museum for programs, marketing materials, and photographs. The Heinz History Center’s collections include costumes used in NNOC productions.\n\nCanoeing to the concert: The Watergate barge stage in Washington, D.C. floated in the Potomac River for 30 years. Locals sat on the steps of the Watergate and in canoes in the River to hear performances by the NNOC, the National Symphony Orchestra, and others. WETA tells the fascinating history of the Watergate barge, complete with first-hand accounts.\n\nEven before the Civil War, Black singers captured the attention of American audiences. Utah Opera’s timeline of Black opera history starts with soprano Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield in 1851 and ends with the voices of today.\n\nYou can keep up with the work of classical African-American singers – both past and present – by joining this public Facebook group: “Famous African-American Singers of Concert and Operatic Literature.”\n\nAudio and Video Resources\n\nHome sweet headquarters: Pittsburgh’s WQED takes you inside the house that not only hosted the National Negro Opera Company, but also welcomed Black luminaries who were denied lodging elsewhere in the city.\n\nGet a “glimpse” of Sandra Seaton’s other works. Seaton is a playwright and librettist who won the Mark Twain Award for Midwestern literature and the Theodore Ward Prize for African-American playwriting. She was Professor of English at Central Michigan University and was the first writer-in-residence at Michigan State University’s College of Law. Her works have been performed at Carnegie Hall, The Kennedy Center, the Library of Congress, and at universities around the country. Last summer, the Festival presented her song cycle on Sally Hemings, a woman enslaved by Thomas Jefferson and also involved with him as his mistress. Watch From the Diary of Sally Hemings and read Seaton’s program note for more insights.\n\nKeep an eye out for Carlos Simon – his star is on the rise. Recently named a recipient of the 2021 Sphinx Medal of Excellence, Simon has fielded commissions from New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Washington National Opera, and many other established companies. He is currently the composer-in-residence at The Kennedy Center and was previously a Composer Fellow at the Sundance Film Festival. Get to know Simon and his music in this early interview from the American Composers Orchestra.\n\nSpot the talent: Opera News’s “Amplify Black Voices 2021” Spotify playlist features a range of Black vocalists, from pop favorites Sam Cooke and Ella Fitzgerald, to stage legends Josephine Baker and Audra McDonald, to opera leaders Leontyne Price and Lawrence Brownlee. Also included are notable Black instrumentalists such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and John Coltrane.\n\nDiscrimination never made her diminuendo: After being barred from booking Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. due to the color of her skin, Black contralto Marian Anderson took her concert to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. There, she performed for an audience of 75,000 people on April 9, 1939. PBS released a new documentary on Anderson earlier this year. Chapter 1 of Voice of Freedom is available for free; PBS Passport holders can log in to watch the full film. (More resources on Anderson, including clips and articles, are available on the Voice of Freedom website.)\n\nFor the Bookworm\n\nInterdisciplinary scholar Naomi André’s celebrated book Black Opera: History, Power, Engagement is a deep dive into the Black artists and Black audiences of opera then and now. Her book reveals truths about race and gender, and showcases opera’s power to represent and even liberate. Hear about André’s book in her own words in this blog post from San Francisco Opera. (Festival Connection: André discusses Seaton’s From the Diary of Sally Hemings in the book.)\n\nAndré is also one of the editors (with Karen M. Bryan and Eric Saylor) of Blackness in Opera. This collection of scholarly essays covers racial representation in operas both well-known (like Porgy and Bess) and less familiar (such as William Grant Still’s Blue Steel).\n\nCan you name 32 Black female opera singers? Find a copy of And So I Sing: African-American Divas of Opera and Concert by violinist and author Rosalyn M. Story, and keep your favorite music streaming service open so you can hear these divas in action.\n\nBlack bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green is a Metropolitan Opera contest winner and a true opera star, though at one point he experienced time in a juvenile detention center. Author and journalist Daniel Bergner’s biography of Green is a “rigorous examination of the institutional forces that shape Green’s life,” as reviewer Anjali Enjeti writes. Check out the New York Times bestseller Sing for Your Life: A Story of Race, Music, and Family.\n\nClassical music as a path to social acceptance: After the Reconstruction Era, groups of African Americans achieved excellence in opera, symphonies, and other classical, white-dominated forms. This work was part of a larger strategy of advocacy called racial uplift ideology. Racial Uplift and American Music, 1878-1943 by music professor Lawrence Schenbeck chronicles the development of this ideology and its impact on American music and culture.\n\nIn Spirituals and the Birth of a Black Entertainment Industry, scholar Sandra Jean Graham traces the Black spiritual from slavery to its use in 19th-century musical entertainments, such as minstrel shows, vaudeville, and plays. Its growing popularity started an industry of performing and selling these songs for both Black and white audiences. (Learn more in this essay by Graham for Zócalo Public Square.)\n\nTalk about a multi-hyphenate artist: Harry T. Burleigh helped immortalize Black spirituals as a music arranger, composer, singer, vocal coach, and more. He was also the first African-American to write a significant body of art songs. Ethnomusicologist Jean E. Snyder captures Burleigh’s life and his sociopolitical context in her book Harry T. Burleigh: From the Spiritual to the Harlem Renaissance."
