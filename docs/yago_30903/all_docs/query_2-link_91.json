        "text": "Here’s another author who’s taking up my offer to spruik the books of Australian authors whose MWF events were cancelled:\n\nFilip Vukašin is a Melbourne doctor whose debut novel Modern Marriage is being published in September by Melbourne Indie publisher Affirm Press, and there’s much to enjoy in this entertaining, escapist novel that draws from Fil’s personal experiences as a GP and cosmetic surgeon, a gay man, and a first generation Serbian-Australian.\n\nHere’s a short video from Fil talking about the book — and, says his publicist Laura, “to give you a sense of his great charisma!\n\nPhoto credit: Matthew Cooksey\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nFilip Vukašin emerges as a major new talent in contemporary Australian fiction with Modern Marriage, a compelling domestic drama that will be loved by fans of Liane Moriarty and Christos Tsiolkas.\n\nEver the high achiever, Fil wrote the first draft of his debut novel on his phone during lunch breaks from his work as a GP as an alternative to doom-scrolling the news. The result is a scintillating escapist read that draws from Fil’s real-life experiences as a doctor, cosmetic surgeon and gay man, set against the backdrop of the turbulent 2017 same-sex marriage plebiscite.\n\nModern Marriage follows Klara, a cosmetic physician who seemingly has it all: great job, devoted husband, plush house and wrinkle-free face. The only thing to elude her is having a baby. So when her husband Dante is found unconscious in a gay sauna, Klara’s life is thrown into disarray as her husband’s situation exposes cracks in her friendships, family and, most pointedly, her sense of self.\n\nThese are some of the issues that are explored in the novel:\n\n• Ingrained prejudice and inequality: Set during the 2017 plebiscite, Modern Marriage draws heavily on Filip’s own experience as a gay man. The campaign was devastating for many Australians and Filip doesn’t shy away from that in the book. He also draws upon his experience coming from a conservative cultural background.\n\n• Healthcare experience: Fil knows what it’s like being a cosmetic surgeon to the rich elite. In addition, the seeds of the novel were sown when Fil heard a male patient had died while in a gay sauna. ‘It led me to wonder what a sudden tragedy like that would do to the family members left behind, particularly if he was there secretly,’ he said.\n\n• Write who you know: Fil has said there’s much of himself in his characters, as well as elements of other people in his life. The protagonist Klara is a cosmetic physician and for some of her work scenes Fil has fictionalised some aspects of his career. Her colleague Tomas is an immigrant, and his storyline shares similarities with Fil’s own past. Rachel is Klara’s sister-in-law, a nosy, self-important psychologist who is a hyperbolic amalgamation of ‘god-complex’ health workers Fil has have come across in his work as a doctor.\n\n• Scratch the surface: Modern Marriage peels away the makeup, Botox, designer clothes and visual merchandising of a life to expose raw secrets, ingrained prejudice and the gap between perception and truth. It’s a fascinating (and wildly entertaining) examination of contemporary relationships, and the veneer of perfection we all project every day, whether it be on social media or otherwise. Klara can’t bear to speak about Dante’s suspected homosexuality, even with her own best friend who is himself gay, for fear of what people will think – but keeping this secret locked up exposes the cracks in Klara’s sense of self.\n\nMany thanks to Laura McNicol Smith who’s the Publicity Manager at Affirm Press for her help with content for this post. She tells me that Fil with his husband and young son have just returned to Australia from the US where their twin baby girls were born by surrogacy. They got to spend some precious days together with the surrogate herself before flying home and entering hotel quarantine with two newborns and a toddler…\n\nAs Laura says, if we feel like whinging about lockdown, we should stop and imagine what what that must be like!"
