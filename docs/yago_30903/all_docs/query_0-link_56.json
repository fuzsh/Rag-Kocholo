        "text": "Jan 20, 2003\n\n9:30pm\n\nWith a Grain of Salt, Darlings\n\nGod, I never thought Id grow to despise a phrase so intensely. Anyway, for those who want to take their Precious Sage with a Grain of Salt, this is the column in particular to do it because were going to be breaking out the Gossip Chips, dippin them into the girly salsa and washing them down with a cold glass of giggles.\n\nAMC\n\nJeddy Peck (Yes, Virgos, I know its J. Eddie, I just like to call the boy, Jeddy, OK? OK) spoke out in those stilted, Im being seriously monitored by the ABC Gestapo terms about the mutual decision between himself and AMC to drop the character of Jake. The main thing, according to Jeddy, is that he felt the Martins were not getting the attention they deserved. He fussed a bit about this last year and wanted to be released from his contract. AMC refused. Enter new regime. He wanted a firm commitment that they were going to come up with some decent stories for the Martin family, they pussed around about it, he asked to be released and they agreed. End of story. He finishes up taping Feb 3rd and will air for the last time around the beginning of March. There are no plans for him to reprise his role of Cole Howard on Young and the Restless.\n\nDont look for any kind of on-screen farewell for Jason Olive, who played (yep, past tense) Frank Hubbard. His last scene was on December 23rd when he told Mia he would not interfere in Williams life. Over. Done. Finito.\n\nLook for Edmunds obsession with Marias memories to get even more intense and even weirder.\n\nKate brought some bad news our way this weekend when she reported with her spoiler commentary that some nimrod at AMC figures its a good idea to create a story that back-burners David Canary for an undetermined amount of time. Looks like Adam is going to be out of the picture for a while.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, Cameron has no intention of returning to the role of Ryan anytime soon. He doesnt discount it for the future, but does for the immediate future.\n\nThe rumors are getting more and more confusing about Anna. Although the push is growing stronger that FH is relocating to GH in February, AMC tells us that Anna and David WILL have their baby together in the spring after moving a little further down that bumpy road. Whether the migration is temporary (if she is the woman in contact with Ric, and personally, I dont think she is) or all a big ruse in either case, I dont know. She supposedly signed a 3 year contract recently with AMC (as opposed with just ABC), but of course, people are released from contracts all the time. I dont think well know for sure until right up onto time for it to happen. ABC seems to have declared war on viewers, especially online fans, and are determined to undermine any attempt at finding out anything, going so far as to leak out red herrings, bad redirects and outright lies. Believe nothing.\n\nOLTL\n\nSpeaking of believing nothing, it extends over into that unsinkable ship, OLTL as well. As many of you know, there was a huge hubbub this weekend when (as the story goes), Catherine Hickland and Ty Treadway both posted on their sites that they had been let go from OLTL and would be leaving in the spring. Not long after that, there were fervent retraction posted, declaring the whole thing a hoax. My impression is that this is more of ABCs spin-doctoring after the fact. Hide and watch. I believe that Lindsay will be gone in March (sent away to St Annes) and Troy will also be written off at the same time. Bookmark this column, loveys, because I find the retraction more suspect than the initial post. Youre going to want to go back and find the place where Sage suspected strongly it was true.\n\nSo if its true, what does that take the count up to now? Ty Treadway, Catherine Hickland, Larry Lau, Teddy Sears (Chad Bennett), Steve Richard Harris (NuSeth, already gone as of January 2nd when Jessica gave him the book) and my beloved, adored Barbara Niven. Although it is RUMORED that Ilene Kirsten will leave the role of Roxy to migrate to GH and renew the part of Janine, I think its bull. I believe Roxy will be hanging around quite a while longer. I mean, she just got her hair makeover! The big question is *if* CH is leaving and LL is leaving, the only Rappaport left will be Jennifer (Jessica Morris). Her contract, I have heard, is up for renewal in March and theres not a breath of a word about its impending status. Roger Howarth is a big question mark as again, rumors of his desire to audition for prime time parts may take him to a West Coast relocation, but as I understand it, we have him through at least to Spring.\n\nA really big influx of newbies is coming if the scuttlebutt is to be believed. Both of Todds daddies, Peter Manning and Victor Lord, are rumored to be returning, with Victor being very nearly surefire.\n\nSpeaking of daddies, as I hear it, Clint Ritchies return as Clint Buchanan is not involved (sadly) with current stories, but will be on February 19th on the OLTL Fan Fantasy episode. It will be great to see him, however.\n\nIf you haven't been over to say good-bye to Barbara Niven, you may do so here. She has left a reply there as well.\n\nThe rumors are strong of a (secret) Robin Strasser return as Dorian during that incredible storm in February, but a friend told me its only if she agrees to shut down her phone hotline and not tell a soul. Her departure from the show was under less than stellar circumstances, so Im sure if there is a return, it will be a situation handled with kid gloves on both sides. My friend on the set says there is NO sign of a Dorian return.\n\nThe first week of February is going to be a big week as two Buchanan kiddies return. Long gone and oft recast Joey Buchanan will appear on the 3rd and NuJessica will be back on the 5th. Open your minds and watch, then well dish about it when theyve had a week or two to settle in.\n\nHillary B. Smith had some carefully chosen words for what is coming up: Starting the week of February 3, when the Josh/Michael stuff begins to air, you are going to see a big change. It will be very different, very character-driven material. It's going to be rich. You may like them, you may hate them, but I promise you, it will be rich.\n\nUm, boy, could that ever be open to interpretation! As always, I suppose we will just have to wait and see with minds open and keyboards at the ready.\n\nLots of Nora stuff coming up as she finds out from Lindsay what happened to Joanna and leaves Troy over it. She doesnt, however, learn about his unorthodox way of dealing with Lindsays blackmail. The big question is whether or not that will continue and if so, where it will lead the hot couple. Once Nora gives Troy the heave ho, she gravitates right toward Bo for couple and Josh Griffith (Head Writer) was freaky vague about what that would mean for Bo and Gabrielle.\n\nMax will have to fight for his relationship with Roxy and in doing so, were going to start to see more sides to him than the one-dimensional Max weve had recently. The question also comes into play about how much of Asas affection for Roxy was an act. He has his own issues as Raes character begins to shift back to using her powers for good instead of evil and return to her right mind.\n\nAll in all, that big storm in February is going to have the winds of change blowing at gale force strength.\n\nGH\n\nYep, I can validate NuEm showing up just in time for Valentines Day, but of course, there will NOT be an instant ZEm revisit. Its going to happen, but will be hard won.\n\nAlexis is going to be backing off of Jason and Brendas case, much to Sonny and Carlys dismay, when she focuses on Kristinas surgery.\n\nThings may get really interesting if Ned challenges Alexis for custody of Kristina. Ned and Flea arent quite finished yet and will be generating some chemistry.\n\nIt will soon be shown that Faith is connected with Edward.\n\nThe Journey is almost at an end. Nope, no baby (this week, at least).\n\nBilly Warlock is NOT expected to leave GH for reprising the role of Frankie on Days.\n\nAJ does meet the business end of a gun with Courtney on the other end of it. At that time, he admits he is the one who paid off Ida to shift blame to Jason. Maybe she tries to save Jason one too many times!\n\nIt might have looked good today when Gia was poking Cameron into a connection with his son, but its not going to break through the docs ironclad walls.\n\nSpeaking of Gia, it doesnt look good for the future of Nia. Im hearing they will both be leaving within a few months and NOT together.\n\nNo word yet on whats going to happen with Vanessa Marcils (quickly ending) contract. As always, last minute stuff.\n\nBrendas big secret?? She has a child? Noooooo. Just that she wants a divorce from Jason.\n\nCatherines New Years Eve tale isnt over yet as Carlys life begins to show some interesting parallels to the story. Whether or not history is set to repeat itself remains to be seen.\n\nOddly, Scott and Laura (Summer) connect and even though she comes close to making love with Lucky, she goes to dinner with Scott and he is drawn to her.\n\nSee the AMC stuff above for the Anna/Finola Hughes speculation.\n\nLastly, you may have heard of a Sonny and Brenda wedding. Rest assured its part of the Fan Fantasy episode on February 26th. How this adds up or at least was advertised is that this is a collection of scenes requested by the fans, so unless something changed, it wont be an hour of Sonny and Brenda. Im eager to see them making that fire again!\n\nSo thats the dish for the week, darlings!! Ill let you know if I hear anything new and who knows? If all goes well, I should have an Uncensored column and an off topic one as well later in the week.\n\nBe Well, My Loves!!\n\n\"Fun Downloads\" - Result 2\n\nJan 20, 2003\n\n10:30am\n\nTo use some net acronyms: OMG! LMAO! I have downloaded each of the personally with virus software ablaze and they all appear to be fine. This is the funnest and funniest stuff EVER!! Enjoy!\n\n(Remember, if you are at work, use start, control panel, \"remove software or program\" to hide your downloading sneak-assed tracks."
