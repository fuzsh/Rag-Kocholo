        "text": "The eight options identified in the ETSU 1989 report and presented to the Prime Minister and her cabinet are shown in Table 1. Also shown are ETSU’s estimates of the potential savings by each option in terms of the 477 Mt CO2 reduction target by 2020. These contributions add to 509 Mt CO2 as the individual numbers were derived for each option acting in isolation and inevitably there are complex interactions between the options, which reduce the total when the options are combined. For example, nuclear power, renewables and alternative fossil fuel generation were in competition to replace the then dominant generation by coal.\n\nThe percentage figures in Table 1 are helpful in giving an indication from where the most significant sources of CO2 reduction were thought likely to come. The four major opportunities identified were from energy efficiency, nuclear power, alternative fossil fuel generation and transport fuel switching. The rationale behind Table 1 is explained in the rest of this section.\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nETSU and BRE had extensively studied improvements in the efficiency of providing energy services in the four main energy-using sectors: residential, non-domestic buildings, industry and transport. ETSU had published, or were working on, four reports addressing the potential of energy saving in each sector to 2000 or 2010 (Langley, 1980; Herring, 1985; Martin & Shock, 1989; Evans & Herring, 1990). These reports identified potential energy savings of 20% savings in industry, 11% in transport, 27% in residential and 36% in electricity end use and 52% fuel saving in the public and commercial sectors. Of particular note were as follows:\n\nimproved insulation in all buildings,\n\nlighting in all buildings,\n\nimproved building and industrial process controls,\n\nmotors and appliances,\n\ndesign of vehicles,\n\nCHP in industrial and public and commercial sectors\n\nThe ETSU 1989 report assumed that all economically attractive energy saving potential would be realised by 2020. Coupled with the assumed business as usual estimate described above, this contribution would mean that energy demand would actually fall by 2020 (as shown in Fig. 2). It would be the largest contributor to the CO2 saved by then, saving 191 Mt CO2. The business as usual estimate did not precisely distinguish between changes due to economic structure and technical energy efficiency improvement. However, the trends of recent economic restructuring were included in the business as usual projection.\n\nReforestation\n\nBased on a study done for ETSU (Mitchell et al., 1987), it was assumed that the 10% of wooded land in UK could be doubled using broadleaved tree species to absorb 11 Mt CO2.\n\nHeat and power from waste\n\nIn 1988, waste streams were 2.7 million tonnes of straw burnt, incineration of 2.5 million tonnes of municipal waste, with 28 million tonnes of waste put to landfill. To avoid emissions of methane (with a global warming potential 28 times higher than CO2), it was assumed there would be major efforts reduce landfill gas emissions for either electricity generation or combined heat and power. However, the desire by HM Inspectorate of Pollution to reduce landfill emissions and growing concerns over the extent of waste disposal to landfill meant that ETSU expected only a relatively small contribution from straw of 3.5 Mt CO2 and the other 25.5 Mt CO2 from either the incineration of, or landfill gas collection from municipal solid waste.\n\nTransport fuel switching\n\nIn 1989 transport was the fastest growing end use sector. Road transport accounted for 80% of the transport energy used and within that, cars represented two-thirds of road transport consumption. Clearly alternative fuels for road transport could make a significant impact, but ETSU’s judgement was that electric vehicles and the use of hydrogen as a road fuel were unlikely to contribute much by 2020. The Brazilian experience, dating back to 1976, of steadily increasing ethanol content in petrol, was known, but without the bagasse from sugar cane from which to distil bioethanol, it was judged that in the UK the economics were not promising. Based on optimistic assumptions about increased use of natural gas and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) in vehicles, it was assumed 12% of the CO2 target could be met from fuel switching to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels.\n\nRenewable electricity\n\nIn 1988, only hydropower made a significant contribution to renewable electricity, generating 4.8 TWh. Wind energy contributed just 23 GWh and there was negligible electricity generation from solar photovoltaics. The ETSU 1989 report projected that the main new renewable energy contributions to electricity generation by 2020 would come from biofuels, onshore wind, small-scale hydropower, tidal energy and geothermal hot dry rocks.\n\nUsing Energy Paper 55 (DEn, 1988), ETSU took the median value of 40 TWh/year from the wide range of electricity production projections by 2020 from these five technologies. Assuming that this additional generation would replace coal, this represented 7% of the CO2 savings to be reached by 2020.\n\nCO2 capture from electricity generation and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery\n\nWhilst the idea of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is now familiar, in 1989, it was a radical new proposition. The concept was to remove carbon dioxide from the flues of power stations and then to store it permanently by pumping it down oil wells, which would have the further benefit of enhancing oil recovery from mature wells.\n\nThe ETSU 1989 report assumed that by 2020, there would be a 2 GW demonstration coal plant operating at a reduced electrical generation efficiency of 35% and with a 90% CO2 capture efficiency, saving 10 Mt CO2 annually.\n\nNuclear power\n\nIn 1988, nuclear power accounted for 20% of electricity production. It was recognised as a low carbon source of electricity and the major source of such electricity at the time. The problems encountered and corresponding delays and increased costs of the advanced gas reactors in the 1960s had led to an abandonment of the plan to build more of these and the Government decided to support PWRs as an alternative. After the Sizewell B enquiry, the UK Government was keen to embark on a significant production line of PWRs. However, given the public reaction to the approval of a Sizewell PWR, it was not clear as to the extent that such a growth plan would be delivered by 2020. For simplicity, the ETSU 1989 report assumed 50% of electricity could come from the existing AGR nuclear plants that would be still open in 2020 and 24 new PWRs. With the increased generation displacing coal, these would save 110 Mt CO2 annually by 2020.\n\nAlternative methods of fossil fuel generation\n\nThe ETSU 1989 report considered a range of options to retain fossil fuel generation whilst reducing emissions by substituting gas for coal and/or using more efficient generation, including district heating and combined heat and power. These were as follows:\n\nsubstituting natural gas for coal in steam turbines,\n\ncombined cycle power plant using natural gas,\n\ncombined cycle power plant using coal,\n\nfluidised bed combustion of coal,\n\ndistrict heating using combined heat and power, and\n\nfuel cell generation using natural gas.\n\nAs discussed above, at the time of the ETSU 1989 report an EU Directive prevented the use of natural gas for electricity generation other than at a small scale. Thus any option using natural gas as a main production fuel was not considered to be significant. In its 1986 appraisal of energy technologies, ETSU had concluded that a 1% improvement in the 37% thermal efficiency of the best existing coal-fired plant was attainable (ETSU, 1987). However, pressure to implement flue gas desulphurisation driven by EU legislation was growing (Skea, 1988) and the CEGB indicated to ETSU that this was likely to reduce the thermal efficiency of the existing coal stations by 1.9% (ETSU, 1987). Consequently, no reduction was envisaged in CO2 emissions from the existing coal-fired plants. The contribution from these options was assumed to come largely from alternative coal generation cycles and CHP production, with a contribution of 71 Mt CO2.\n\nIn this section, we compare the ETSU 1989 report projections for each option in the 477 Mt CO2 reduction target by 2020 with the outturn, based on 2019 UK energy data. It might be argued that we should wait for the 2020 energy data. However, it is already evident that 2020 energy use will be hugely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, and therefore is unlikely to be a suitable comparator in the context of long-term energy trends.\n\nThe data for energy are the most recent Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) statistics (BEIS, 2020a) supplemented by DTI (1992, Tables 47 and 48); for carbon dioxide emissions, we use BEIS provisional UK greenhouse gas emissions (BEIS, 2020b) supplemented by DTI (1992, Appendix C Table C8). Table 2 summarises the relevant figures for 1988 and 2019 as well as the changes between the 2 years and Fig. 4 shows a comparison between the ETSU 1989 report’s projections on energy intensity and the outturn.\n\nThere have been significantly more years with low (and even negative) GDP growth than assumed, particularly in the early 1990s and the recession that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. As a result, UK GDP has grown at an average of 1.97% per year rather than the assumed 2.25% per year in the period 1989 to 2019. GDP in 2019 is 8% below the ETSU 1989 report projection and this explains the mismatch of the x-axis in Fig. 4.\n\nUntil 2000, energy efficiency improvement was broadly in line with the ETSU business as usual projection so that primary energy final use rose approximately 10%. Energy demand was then fairly flat until 2007, even though GDP grew strongly in early 2000s. Demand since 2007 has declined, most notably during the recession, but the decline continued as economic growth was restored, so that total primary energy demand fell 20% from the 2005 peak to 2019, whilst the economy grew by 21%. In conclusion, total primary energy demand has fallen by 26 Mtoe since 1988. This is a 6.3 Mtoe larger fall than in the ETSU 1989 report energy efficiency projection.\n\nIn Table 2, the most notable reductions are in primary energy and the near elimination of coal- and oil-fuelled electricity generation The CO2 emission reductions from UK electricity supply and other energy uses are 139.6 Mt CO2 and 99 Mt CO2, respectively. Allowing for the zero CO2 emission generators in 1988 (nuclear and hydro), fossil-fuelled generation (coal and oil were 79% of all generation at that time) had an average carbon emission of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh.\n\nBy 2019, the primary energy for fossil-fuelled generation had fallen, as coal had been replaced by renewable energy and combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). In 2019, CCGTs have a thermal efficiency of 48.8% compared to the remaining coal-fired plant of 31.9% (BEIS, 2020a, Table 5.10).\n\nThere has also been a dramatic change in the fuel mix of final energy consumption (BEIS, 2020a, Table 1.1.5). In 1988, total energy demand was 148.6 Mtoe and energy demand in 2019 was 142.0 Mtoe on a final energy supplied basis. What is particularly relevant is that the end use of solid fuels and natural gas have reduced since 1988 and only the end use of electricity, petroleum and bioenergy (including waste) have grown. The increase from bioenergy and waste is discussed in ‘Transport fuel switching’ section. Growth in demand for petroleum (due to an increase in transport use) has been slow (62.0 Mtoe in 1988) to 63.1 Mtoe in 2019; if this had been a uniform growth (which it is not), this would have been equivalent to 0.058% per year. Electricity use has risen from 22.8 Mtoe in 1988 to 25.4 Mtoe in 2019; if this had been a uniform growth (which it is not), this would have been equivalent to 0.35% per year. This reflects the growing use of electricity in all end use sectors despite greatly improved energy efficiency as discussed in ‘End use energy efficiency’ section.\n\nThe increase in UK renewable energy supplied to the grid has been remarkable and it now contributes 114.3 TWh in 2019, growing from 4.8 TWh in 1988, which was very largely from large hydropower. The nuclear supplied contribution has slightly dropped from 55.6 TWh in 1988 to 51.0 TWh in 2020. The combined addition to UK electricity supply from CCGT and new renewables since 1988 is 239 TWh. This implies that these 2 sources have replaced the lost electricity supplied by coal and oil to the grid of 217.5 TWh.\n\nFor UK electricity generation, the rise in gas-fired generation and subsequent growth in renewable electricity has had a distinct benefit for CO2 emissions. Compared to 1988 electricity generation emissions of 197 Mt CO2, there has been a reduction of 107 Mt CO2. This arises from the renewable electricity generation technologies (described in ‘Heat and power from waste’ and ‘Renewable electricity’ sections), the rise in gas-fired generation (‘Alternative methods of fossil fuel generation’ section) and improved energy efficiency in the end services provided by electricity (‘End use energy efficiency’ section).\n\nFor the CO2 savings from CCGT, we have used the difference between the 1988 fossil fuel figure of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh derived at the beginning of this section and the CCGT figure of 0.37 kg CO2/kWh (BEIS, 2020a, Table 5E). So the 129.5 TWh supplied (BEIS, 2020a, Table 5.6) has saved 66 Mt CO2.\n\nFor the CO2 savings from new renewables since 1988, we have used the 1988 fossil fuel figure of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh derived at the beginning of this section.\n\nFor end use energy efficiency, we looked at the actual final energy consumption in 2019 compared to the ETSU business as usual projection, as discussed in ‘End use energy efficiency’ section.\n\nThe reduction from actual 1988 emissions required to meet the 50% target reduction for 2020 set out in the ETSU 1989 report would have required a reduction to an annual emission rate of 293 Mt CO2; as we are using UK 2019 data, this equates to an annual emission rate of 303 Mt CO2. The 2019 actual UK CO2 emissions are provisionally 351.5 Mt CO2, implying a shortfall of 48.5 Mt CO2 from the ETSU 1989 report mitigation target. It should be remembered that the target and its constituent parts were not a prediction, just an analysis of options for policymakers to consider. However, where there are discrepancies between what has been achieved and the mitigation potential identified 30 years ago, it is illuminating to understand why this has happened.\n\nTable 3 summarises the ETSU 1989 report mitigation option assessment and the actual 2019 outturn for UK CO2 savings. The outcomes for the individual options are detailed in the rest of this section.\n\nEnd use energy efficiency\n\nEnd use energy efficiency is about providing the same or better energy service whilst reducing the energy consumed. Therefore to get a measure of the CO2 savings from end use energy efficiency, we need to focus on final energy use, as some of the primary energy savings will come from CCGT gas-fired generation and renewable electricity. Therefore, we need to evaluate against the final energy demand projections from the ETSU 1989 business as usual projection. This drew on the 1983 to 1988 trends in end use energy as follows: energy demand was assumed to grow annually by 1.2%, 1.6% and 0.5% for transport fuels, electricity and heating fuels, respectively. The different rates of increase were based on past data and reflected expectations about structural changes in the economy away from heating towards transportation and services provided by electricity. In Table 4, we contrast these business as usual projections with the actual outturn.\n\nThe largest absolute reductions in energy demand have been in heating fuels a 34% reduction compared to ETSU 1988 bau; this has saved 68 Mt CO2. However, electricity efficiency improvements have contributed more to carbon emissions reduction, because of the high emission factor of electricity in 1988; a 32% reduction compared to ETSU 1988 bau; this has saved 123 Mt CO2. This is despite the increasing demand for services provided by electricity which have evolved from 1988 in all end use sectors. In the transport sector, a 16.5% reduction in energy demand compared to ETSU 1988 bau has saved 33 Mt CO2.\n\nCaution is needed in ascribing these changes solely to energy efficiency technology improvement. As explained in ‘ETSU 1989 appraisal estimates of potential CO2 saving’ section, the ETSU 1989 report did not distinguish between changes due to economic structure and technical energy efficiency improvement, and therefore we can only precisely report on the combined effect—the change in energy intensity. For the purposes of this report, we assume that the changes set out in Table 4 represent energy efficiency improvement, and the growth rates assumed in the business as usual projection reflect the structural changes to the economy over the period. This is consistent with what is known about the relative contributions to energy intensity reduction of technical efficiency improvement and structural change (Hardt et al., 2018 who found that offshoring contributed 28% of energy demand reduction from UK productive activities in the period 1997 to 2013).\n\nIt is clear that energy efficiency improvement has been a major contributor to emissions reduction across all forms of energy use. Averaged over the period, improvements have been approximately 1% per year. It is also worth remembering the increasing demand for services provided by electricity since 1988 in all end use sectors. For example in the residential sector, entertainment, information and communication, and induction hob cooking are popular innovations. Yet electricity demand in the residential sector in 1988 was 64.7 TWh with 64% used to provide lighting and refrigeration; whereas in 2018, residential electricity demand was 65.8 TWh with only 34% used to provide lighting and refrigeration (BEIS, 2020c).\n\nIn summary, the reduction in energy demand has been almost the same as set out in the ETSU 1989 report’s energy efficiency projection, which was widely judged to be ambitious at the time. However, this has not been a smooth transition, with an initial rise followed by recent rapid falls. A number of factors have contributed, including the ‘off-shoring’ of the manufacturing products used in the UK, which was most prominent in the first decade of the 2000s as the Chinese economy grew quickly (Hardt et al., 2018).\n\nMaking the assumption that the additional reduction in final energy demand is solely due to energy efficiency, the mitigation due to energy efficiency is 224 Mt CO2, i.e. 33 Mt CO2 greater than the 191 Mt CO2 projected in the ETSU 1989 report energy efficiency projection. Even taking into account the uncertainty due to allocation between technical efficiency improvement and economic restructuring, energy efficiency is certainly the largest contributor to observed mitigation.\n\nFrom 2005, the rapid reduction was driven by the stronger energy efficiency policies adopted at both EU level and in UK following 2004 Energy Efficiency Action Plan (Defra, 2004). Key changes were major increases in building energy efficiency (Lees, 2008; Rosenow, 2012) and higher efficiency boilers, vehicles and appliances, all driven by some form of regulatory policy instrument. The key overall finding is the substantial energy efficiency has been achieved, although the policy effectiveness over time has been mixed (Mallaburn & Eyre, 2014). Effective policies have generally been ones that focus on individual sectors or even technologies, recognise the range of barriers that need to be addressed and therefore use a wide range of policy options including regulation, incentives and information.\n\nReforestation\n\nGovernment data on greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 (BEIS, 2020b) show negative emissions (i.e. net absorption) of −11.7 Mt CO2 for land use, land use change and forestry. Since 1990, the increase in land use CO2 sequestration has been 9.3 Mt CO2, so the improvement from 1988 is probably around 10 Mt CO2. This is very similar to the mitigation potential of 10 Mt CO2 set out in the ETSU 1989 report, although the latter figure was solely for reforestation.\n\nHeat and power from waste\n\nIn 1988, landfill gas and sewage gas provided 0.4 TWh electricity. By 2019, generation from these sources plus anaerobic digestion and energy crops had increased to 31.5 TWh (BEIS, 2020a, Table 5.6). In this analysis we exclude incineration of municipal waste, tyres etc. (5.9 TWh in 2019) as this has not been counted as a renewable energy source in UK Government statistics since 2013. As eligible electricity from waste has substituted for coal-fired electricity with a carbon content of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh, the savings have been 27.4 Mt CO2.\n\nBy 2019, there had been a significant expansion of wood and other energy crops as a heating fuel, so that renewable bioenergy provided 4.0 Mtoe of heat (BEIS, 2020a, Table 6.1) dominated by 2.3 Mtoe wood used in the residential sector and 1.1 Mtoe plant biomass mainly in industry. Reliable data for earlier years on wood burning are not available and the 1988 figure of 0.16 Mtoe is likely to be an underestimate as the Government survey of this energy source (BEIS, 2015) confirmed that historical data had been underestimated by up to a factor of 3. Unfortunately data were only corrected back to 2008 and so the actual figure for all renewable heat in 1988 of 0.32 Mtoe could be as high as 0.6 Mtoe. It is likely that renewable heat has saved between 3.4 and 3.7 Mtoe. CO2 emission savings depend on the fuels replaced, which are not precisely known. Assuming oil was the displaced fuel, the savings could be up to 10 Mt CO2.\n\nEven allowing for the uncertainty in the CO2 reductions from heat, we are confident that these renewable sources have still managed carbon dioxide savings greater than the potential identified in the ETSU 1989 report, despite combustible municipal waste streams etc. being no longer counted as a renewable resource.\n\nTransport fuel switching\n\nDespite considerable increases in annual vehicle mileage since 1988, the increase in CO2 emissions from road transport has been modest at 5.4 Mt CO2. This is primarily due to improved vehicle energy efficiency, including through the increase in more efficient diesel engines, with diesel use rising from 29.75% of road transport fuel in 1988 to 66.9% in 2019. The switch to diesel cars has been much faster than the 1989 ETSU report envisaged. Road vehicle efficiency improvements have been driven by EU requirements for carbon dioxide emissions from cars, although actual performance has been shown to be significantly worse than the test results against which compliance is judged (Anable & Goodwin, 2019) and the recent rapid growth in the market share of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) is also undermining progress (Anable et al., 2019). These improvements in vehicle efficiency are included in the analysis of energy efficiency above.\n\nThe use of biofuels in road transport has also contributed to emission reductions, rising from negligible levels in 1988 to 753 million litres of ethanol (1.6% of total road transport fuel) and 1598 million litres of biodiesel (3.4%) in 2018; LPG and natural gas consumption remain negligible at less than 1000 tonnes. Using the BEIS website for UK Government greenhouse gas reporting conversion factors, the CO2 savings in 2019 were, for bioethanol 1.65 Mt CO2, and for biodiesel 4.04 Mt CO2, so a total of 5.7 Mt CO2 overall saving from transport biofuels.\n\nThe Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) increased the percentage of biofuel production for transport fuel producers from 7.25% in 2018 to 8.5% in 2019. Even with these increases, savings from transport fuel switching will be significantly less than the 55 Mt CO2 potential identified in the ETSU 1989 report. The potential identified was primarily from road fuel gases which have not proved an attractive option for vehicle manufacturers despite some UK fiscal incentives. Instead, savings have been delivered through the introduction of biodiesel and the substitution of bioethanol for petrol. The ETSU 1989 report did not anticipate that EU legislation (EU, 2009) would require member states, by 2020, to source 10% of petrol and diesel from biofuels.\n\nRenewable electricity\n\nThe generation of renewable electricity was one area where the potential identified in the ETSU 1989 report significantly underestimated what subsequently has transpired. Even excluding the 31.5 TWh bioenergy electricity generation discussed earlier, 82.8 TWh were generated by renewables in 2019, primarily from wind (onshore and offshore) and solar photovoltaics, compared to the ETSU 1989 report potential estimate of 45 TWh/year by 2020. Renewable generation in 1988 was 4.8 TWh (DTI, 1992, Table 47).\n\nThe reason for ETSU’s underestimate was the failure to anticipate the dramatic drop in costs of wind and photovoltaics and the active policy support for their deployment. In the last 5 years, the economics and deployment of wind and solar energy have changed far faster than envisaged. Globally, the installed costs of wind turbines have fallen by a factor of three in real terms since 1989 and the costs of large-scale solar PV in the UK have fallen by 77% since just 2010 (IRENA, 2019). At the same time, the UK has been required under the EU, 2009 Renewable Energy Directive to progress towards supplying 15% of total energy demand from renewables by 2020, and this has been cheaper to deliver through electricity generation. In the UK, offshore wind development has been most significant. Contracts for offshore wind generation with the UK Government fell from 15.5 p/kWh in 2015 to 4.0 p/kWh in 2019. The progress with multi-MW PV farms has been similarly impressive, with contracted prices under the GB Feed in Tariff falling from 12.21 p/kWh in 2015 to 5.43 p/kWh in 2019. In both cases, costs are now approximately equal to or less than the wholesale electricity price, which was typically 4.5 p/kWh in 2019 (Ofgem, 2020).\n\nAs set out in the introduction to this section, the additional 78.0 TWh of generation achieved in 2019 substitutes for electricity with carbon content of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh, resulting in an estimated saving of 68.6 Mt CO2.\n\nTo a significant extent, the growth in deployment of renewable energy in the UK has been contingent on the price reductions for wind and solar technology that have been a function of global markets. Nevertheless, globally public policy to support deployment has also been critical. The EU Renewable Energy Directive was a key driver, but it still needed to be implemented at a national level. Electricity wholesale market reform that enabled low-risk contracts for investors has been critical, especially for offshore wind.\n\nCO2 capture from electricity generation\n\nThere has been no significant use of carbon capture and storage in the UK to date. The International Energy Agency’s programme on CCS research did not begin until 1991 and the first demonstration, for enhanced oil recovery in the Norwegian Sleipner field, was not operational until 1996. Commercial interest in building a demonstration power station with CCS was shown in the period 2010 to 2015 and there were two preferred bidders agreed by the government, SSE and Shell, and the White Rose Consortium. SSE and Shell proposed to capture CO2 from a 426 MW coal-fired plant near Drax. However, the government cancelled all grant funding in 2015 and consequently no CCS plant has yet been built in the UK. In summary, the ETSU 1989 report was justified in being cautious about the potential of an untried technology.\n\nNuclear power\n\nIn reality, no nuclear power plant construction has been completed in UK since Sizewell B was commissioned in February 1995, and none is now expected until 2025 at the earliest.\n\nThe ETSU 1989 report assumed that the five existing advanced gas reactors (AGRs) and two then under construction would continue to operate and that there would be a large additional fleet of PWRs constructed by 2020. This was based on Government policy enunciated at the time, and therefore not an unreasonable assumption. Through RD&D, it was believed that the lifetime of the AGR reactors could be increased to 35 years and that their annual load factor could be improved to 74%. The first objective was met, as initially was the load factor improvement. However, the 2019 annual load factor dropped to 62.9% (BEIS, 2020a, Table 5.10) resulting in the energy supplied in 2019 by nuclear power being 51.0 TWh, which represents a decline in nuclear supplied of 4.6 TWh from 1988. Thus the 23% contribution of additional nuclear power to reducing CO2 emissions by 2020 has not materialised. In retrospect, this was clearly the biggest single mitigation potential identified in the ETSU 1989 report that has not been delivered.\n\nThe reasons for the failure of the UK nuclear programme have been discussed extensively elsewhere (MacKerron, 2004) and will not be repeated here. For the purposes of this paper, what matters is why the outcome and the ex-ante potential are so different. In 1989, the controversial aspects of nuclear power relating to wastes, accidents and weapons were already well-known. In retrospect, the issue that policymakers seriously neglected was the interaction of the proposed nuclear programme with the broader energy policy priority for market liberalisation. Thirty years of experience have indicated that the two policies appear to be inconsistent. Although initial signs were becoming apparent in 1989 (Holmes 1987), the reality was not so clearly established.\n\nAlternative methods of fossil fuel generation\n\nThe ETSU 1989 report envisaged significant contributions to emissions reductions from a range of fossil fuel technologies, including cleaner coal technologies. In practice, fuel switching to natural gas has been the dominant effect, principally to combined cycle gas turbines, CCGT. Gas-fired power stations supplied 129.5 TWh in 2019 (BEIS, 2020a) compared to a negligible amount in 1989.\n\nFor the CO2 savings from CCGT gas replacing coal-fired generation, we have used the difference between the 1988 fossil fuel figure of 0.88 kg CO2/kWh derived at the beginning of this section and the CCGT figure of 0.37 kg CO2/kWh in 2019. So the 129.5 TWh of CCGT has saved 66.0 Mt CO2.\n\nIt is clear that gas has taken a much bigger share of the electricity market than envisaged in the ETSU 1989 report. The critical factor has been the legislation that allowed natural gas to be used as a fuel for electricity generation. The liberalisation of the GB electricity market created new entrants who wanted to build low cost capacity quickly and combined cycle gas turbines were the technology of choice. The combined effect prompted the ‘dash for gas’ in power generation (Watson, 1997). Coupled with increasingly stringent constraints on acid emissions from coal-fired power stations, this has resulted in coal-fired generation coming out of the electricity mix quicker than anticipated in 1989."
