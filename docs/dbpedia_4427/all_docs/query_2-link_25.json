        "text": "2. Searching for records\n\nSearch Discovery, our catalogue, to find records from over 2,500 archives across the UK, as well as from The National Archives itself. Your search results will tell you which archives currently hold the records. You can then refine your results.\n\nUse the ‘record creator’ tab to find where records created by a particular business or individual are held. Alternatively use the filters to find where records are held which mention the business/individual you searched for.\n\nFor further tips on searching see our catalogue help pages.\n\nThe majority of historic business and trade records in the UK are held by local record offices. Use the Find an archive tool to find contact details of archives/repositories across the UK. This tool also includes details of some repositories abroad which hold substantial collections relating to British history.\n\n3. Records recently collected by other archives\n\nMany archives regularly take in new records to add to their collections – this process is known as accessioning. Every year, The National Archives collects information about new accessions from 250 archives across Britain and Ireland. This is known as the annual Accessions to Repositories’ survey.\n\nThis information is added to Discovery, our catalogue. It is also edited and used to produce thematic digests, including one relating to education history. The digests are made available through this website and distributed for publication in a number of learned journals and newsletters. Further information is available at Accessions to Repositories.\n\n4.
