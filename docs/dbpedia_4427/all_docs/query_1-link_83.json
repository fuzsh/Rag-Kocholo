        "text": "3.1 Fossil fuels\n\nSo what are the principle energy systems used by humanity at present, and how sustainable are they?\n\nUntil quite recently, human energy requirements were modest and our supplies came either from harnessing natural processes such as the growth of plants, which provided wood for heating and food to energise human or animal muscles, or from the power of water and wind, used to drive simple machinery.\n\nBut the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw a massive increase in global energy use, based mainly on burning cheap and plentiful fossil fuels: first coal, then oil and natural gas. These fossil fuels now supply over 80 per cent of the world's current energy consumption (see Box 1).\n\nFossil fuels are extremely attractive as energy sources. They are highly concentrated, enabling large amounts of energy to be stored in relatively small volumes. They are relatively easy to distribute, especially oil and gas which are fluids.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, these unique advantages enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated and effective technologies for transforming fossil fuel energy into useful heat, light and motion; these ranged from the oil lamp to the steam engine and the internal combustion engine. Today, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, fossil fuel-based systems reign supreme, supplying the great majority of the world's energy.\n\nThe fossil fuels we use today originated in the growth and decay of plants and marine organisms that existed on the earth millions of years ago. Coal was formed when dead trees and other vegetation became submerged under water and were subsequently compressed, in geological processes lasting millions of years, into concentrated solid layers below the earth's surface. Oil and associated natural gas originally consisted of the remains of countless billions of marine organisms that slowly accreted into layers beneath the earth's oceans and were gradually transformed, through geological forces acting over aeons of time, into the liquid and gaseous reserves we access today by drilling into the earth's crust. The fossil fuels are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, which is why they are called hydrocarbons.\n\nCoal was the fuel that powered the industrial revolution. Its combustion produces relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) compared with other fuels. It also results in particulates (soot), and sulphur dioxide emissions, though these can be reduced by various techniques. The use of coal in UK homes and industry has now been largely superseded by natural gas, but it is still used for electricity generation. Huge world-wide coal reserves remain, enough for several hundred years' use at current rates.\n\nOil is the world's leading energy source. Its high energy density and convenience of use are particularly advantageous in the transport sector, where it is the dominant fuel. Oil combustion produces less CO2 per unit of energy released than burning coal, but more CO2 than burning natural gas. Proven world oil reserves are sufficient for about 40 years of use at current rates.\n\nNatural gas combustion produces significantly lower CO2 emissions per unit of energy than the combustion of other fossil fuels. Emissions are also free from sulphur dioxide or particulates. The relative cleanliness and convenience of natural gas have made it the preferred fuel for heating and, increasingly, for electricity generation in Western Europe. Proven world gas reserves are sufficient for about 60 years of use at current rates.\n\nSince the fossil fuels were created in specific circumstances where the geological conditions were favourable, the largest deposits of oil, gas and coal tend to be concentrated in particular regions of the globe (see Figure 16a, b, and c) â€“ although less appreciable deposits are remarkably widespread. The majority of the world's oil reserves are located in the Middle East and North Africa, while the majority of our natural gas reserves are split roughly equally between the Middle East/North Africa and the former Soviet Union (BP, 2002). Although coal deposits are rather more evenly spread throughout the world, three-quarters of world coal reserves are concentrated in just four countries: Australia, China, South Africa and the United States of America (United Nations, 2000; BP, 2002) (Figure 16c).\n\nAlthough human society now consumes fossil fuels at a prodigious rate, the amounts of coal, oil and gas that remain are still very large. One simple way of assessing the size of reserves is called the reserves/production (R/P) ratio â€“ the number of years the reserves would last if use continued at the current rate.\n\nCoal has the largest R/P ratio. Present estimates suggest the world has more than 200 years' worth of coal left at current use rates. For oil, current R/P estimates suggest a lifetime of about 40 years at current rates. For gas, the R/P ratio is somewhat higher, at around 60 years (BP, 2002) (Figure 17).\n\nFossil fuel reserves/production ratios need to be interpreted with great caution, however. They do not take into account the discovery of new proven reserves, or technological developments that enable more fuel to be extracted from deposits or improve the economic viability of 'difficult' deposits.\n\nDespite these developments, it seems likely that, at least in the case of oil from conventional sources, world production will reach a peak in the first decade of this century. From then on, although vast quantities of conventional oil will still remain, the resource will be on a declining curve (United Nations, 2000; Campbell and Laherrere, 1998). This seems likely to lead to increased instability and potential for conflict as the twenty-first century proceeds."
