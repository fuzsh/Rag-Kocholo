        "text": "Portfolio Scope\n\nBelow we provide a comprehensive overview of S&P Global Ratings' transportation infrastructure portfolio broken down between four asset types: roads, railways and mass transit, airports, and ports; and across five market sectors: North America, Latin America (LATAM), Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). We discuss changes in the ratings and outlooks since the end of 2022, as well as the portfolio's profitability and cash flow performance at a high level.\n\nThis report focuses on debt issues rated under our General Project Finance Rating Methodology (\"projects\") and issuers rated under our Corporate and Project Developers Methodologies. It does not include credits rated under Americas Public Finance (APF) or International Public Finance (IPF) methodologies (see Related Research for further resources on these sectors). We also note that this report focuses on unenhanced ratings; therefore, for credits that have enhanced ratings provided by a monoline wrap, we use S&P Underlying Ratings (SPUR) in our analysis. All global ratings data is as of July 19, 2024.\n\nRoads And Car Parks\n\nRating distribution and changes\n\nRoads, constituting over half of our transportation infrastructure portfolio, experienced notable ratings uplift since the start of 2023. While we affirmed 73% of the portfolio, we upgraded 21% (18 credits) at least one notch and only downgraded 5% (four credits). The 'BBB' median rating for roads is in line with the 'BBB' median rating for the transportation infrastructure portfolio as a whole.\n\nUpgrades occurred primarily in EMEA and LATAM, along with a handful in North America. Corporate roads saw less ratings movement compared to project finance ratings--within roads, 72% of upgrades and 100% of downgrades were to project finance credits. This was partially attributable to the rollout of the revised General Project Finance Rating Methodology, published in December 2022.\n\nFor example, Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico LLC (BBB/Positive) was upgraded due to its minimum DSCR of 1.55x at an operations phase business assessment (OPBA) of '5' now mapping to a preliminary operations SACP one notch higher. Meanwhile, Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista Central S.A. (A/Negative) was upgraded due to its liquidity now assessed as strong under the new criteria, providing a notch of uplift.\n\nFurthermore, the upgrade to Brazil (BB/Stable) in December 2023 primarily drove a large number of upgrades in Latin America. This is because the sovereign caps the ratings of most of our rated roads and ports in the country.\n\nAside from the criteria change, robust traffic volumes drove several upgrades. Autopista del Sol Concesionaria Espanola S.A. (BBB+/Stable), Autovia de la Mancha S.A. (BBB-/Stable), CountyRoute (A130) PLC (B+/Positive), and car park operator Indigo Group S.A. (BBB/Stable) were all upgraded on resilient earnings and debt service performance driven by traffic volume growth. Traffic for Autopista del Sol Concesionaria Espanola in September 2023 increased 14% year over year, Autovia de la Mancha experienced record-high traffic volumes, and CountyRoute A130's resilient traffic volumes exceeded our forecast despite softness in heavy vehicle traffic.\n\nAdditionally in North America, NYNJ Link Borrower LLC (A-/Stable) was upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+' on sustained strong performance. The project, which benefits from availability-based revenues, has had no deductions, and operating costs sustained around 30% below original projections.\n\nThis positive ratings shift reflects our view of a strong recovery for the toll road sector following the COVID-19 pandemic and our belief that rebounded traffic volumes will continue to sustain cash flow for our road projects. Furthermore, roads across our portfolio implemented toll rate increases successfully, mitigating inflation and supporting consistent debt-service coverage without losing volume.\n\nThe newly introduced tax in France on long-distance transportation infrastructure to fund the decarbonization of the sector has not had a material bearing on our toll road ratings. However, it will slightly reduce EBITDA margins for 2024 (see \"New French Transport Infrastructure Tax Could Delay Operators’ Long-Term Deleveraging Plan\", published on Jan. 22, 2024, on RatingsDirect). Operators are generally mitigating the financial impact by reducing their dividend distributions amid solid headroom.\n\nOur smaller grouping of roads ratings in APAC held stable, underpinned by continued traffic recovery, good financing access, and persistently robust government support. In China, we expect traffic growth to moderate following a strong post-COVID rebound in 2023. We are also observing tapering road investment in the country, due policymakers' tightening control over debt risk, particularly in high-risk provinces identified based on local governments' debt burdens. Despite this, most companies still maintain their access to low-cost funding.\n\nThe small handful of downgrades were mostly attributable to factors other than underlying trends in traffic. We downgraded Rutas de Lima S.A.C. (CCC+/Negative) to 'CCC+' from 'B-' because the Constitutional Court of Peru issued a judgement against the project ordering a suspension of all toll collections at one of the project's routes, which constitutes approximately 30% of the project's revenue. As a result, we now project the project will post DSCR under 1x for 2024 and will gradually deplete its reserve accounts. In EMEA, the downgrade of Ostregion Investmentgesellschaft Nr. 1 S.A. (B+/Stable) reflects a higher budget for life-cycle costs.\n\nENA Norte Trust (CCC+/Stable) was an exception, which we downgraded to 'CCC+' from 'BB-'. This stemmed from traffic underperformance relative to our expectations over the past six years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing competition, lower GDP growth, and, more recently, protests in Panama City. We now forecast cash flow available for debt service (CFADS) and liquidity reserves will be insufficient to pay down the April 2028 maturity, exposing the project to refinancing risk.\n\nOutlook distribution and revisions\n\nThe overarching outlook for roads remains steady, with a stable outlook for 87% of credits and a chiefly neutral outlook bias (6% positive and 7% negative). Accordingly, we expect the portfolio to hover near its current level in 2024, with less movement in the ratings compared to the upward swing observed in 2023.\n\nWhile we believe traffic recovery has already stabilized for most of the portfolio, a minority of toll road credits continue to realize upside from such tailwinds. The positive outlooks on Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico, CountyRoute (A130), and Elizabeth River Crossings Opco LLC (BBB/Positive) reflect our expectations for continued traffic growth driving revenue and coverage improvements.\n\nIn addition to the observed upgrades and credits on positive outlook, we note multiple credits have experienced outlook revisions to stable from negative since year-end 2022. For example, we revised the outlook for Nouvelle Autoroute 30 S.E.N.C. (BBB+/Stable) following traffic recovery and stabilization a year ahead of our expectations. This allowed for successful toll rate expansions, bolstering cash flow and coverage ratios.\n\nFurthermore, our small set of rated parking operators has witnessed similar trends as toll roads, with healthy volume growth and toll rate increases supporting credit quality. The current positive outlook on car park operator MEIF 5 Arena Holdings SLU (BB-/Positive) reflects this recovery and our expectation that credit metrics will continue to improve.\n\nConversely, negative outlooks largely stem from location-specific issues in LATAM. The negative outlook on Chile (A/Negative), due to weakening political consensus, drives the negative outlooks for Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista Central and Sociedad Concesionaria Costanera Norte S.A. (A/Negative), while the negative outlook on Panama (BBB/Negative), due to the Minera Panama mining contract controversy, drives the negative outlook for ENA Master Trust (BBB/Negative). Meanwhile, as noted earlier, the negative outlook on Rutas de Lima S.A.C. (CCC+/Negative) reflects the ongoing judicial dispute with the Constitutional Court of Peru.\n\nRailways And Mass Transit\n\nRating distribution and changes\n\nCompared to all other transportation asset types, railways and mass transit demonstrated the greatest stability throughout 2023 and thus far in 2024. We affirmed 86% of ratings, while we upgraded 7% (two ratings) and downgraded 7% (two ratings). All rating changes were to corporate entities, with two upgrades in EMEA, one downgrade in EMEA, and one downgrade in APAC. In EMEA and APAC, stronger rail and mass transit ratings compared to roads or airports typically incorporate our view of extraordinary government support, which may contribute to ratings' high stability.\n\nUkrainian Railways JSC (CCC+/Negative) was upgraded to 'CCC+' from 'SD' (selective default) after a debt restructuring extended its maturity profile. Near-term liquidity pressures have eased; however, we maintain a negative outlook given the potential effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on the railway's ability to generate operating cash flow.\n\nWe also upgraded Vygruppen AS (A-/Negative) after the group was awarded two 10-year direct purchase contracts in Norway. While this points toward a supportive regulatory framework supporting a higher rating level, the recent negative outlook reflects higher lease-funded spending and weaker profitability than previously expected.\n\nMeanwhile, One Rail Australia Holdings Ltd. (BB-/Stable) experienced multiple downgrades since the end of 2022. In May 2023, we downgraded One Rail to 'BB' from 'BBB-' due to A$200 million of additional subordinated debt incurred as part of an acquisition by Magnetic Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd. (MIG). Another downgrade to 'BB-' from 'BB' followed in April 2024 due to weaker consolidated financial leverage following an additional A$125 million of mezzanine debt issued by MIG to meet the balance consideration for its purchase of One Rail. While One Rail has a stand-alone credit profile of 'bb+' and stronger FFO to debt compared to MIG, the rating is limited by the group credit profile of 'bb-' given our assessment of One Rail as a core subsidiary of the group.\n\nNew to the portfolio is Brightline Trains Florida LLC (BBB-/Stable) and Brightline East LLC (B/Stable), the operator and parent, respectively, of the 235-mile high speed passenger rail project with service newly opened between Miami and Orlando, Fla. We rated $2.2 billion of senior tax-exempt bonds issued by the operating company and $1.3 billion of senior secured debt issued by the parent.\n\nOutlook distribution and revisions\n\nFollowing high stability in 2023, the outlook for railways and mass transit in 2024 holds largely steady. While 81% of ratings maintain a stable outlook, 13% carry a negative outlook and 6% carry a positive outlook. The greater number of negative outlooks more so reflects sovereign ratings and regional events than trends in the rail sector. Current negative outlooks include Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado (EFE; A/Negative), reflecting the negative outlook on Chile; Societe Nationale SNCF S.A. (AA-/Negative), reflecting the negative outlook on France (AA); and Ukrainian Railway JSC, due to the ongoing war.\n\nConversely, the positive outlook on Channel Link Enterprises Finance PLC (BBB/Positive) reflects the company's resilient financial profile in spite of competition with ferries, a soft U.K. economy, regulatory changes on the EU's entry/exit system, and renovations at Amsterdam Centraal train station. Likewise, the positive outlook on High Speed Rail Finance (1) PLC (BBB+/Positive) reflects an increase in traffic volumes, with rating upside contingent on improved performance from revenue counterparty Eurostar.\n\nAdditionally, we note positive movement since 2022 in three outlook revisions to stable from negative-- East Japan Railway Co. (A+/Stable) and Central Japan Railway Co. (A+/Stable), reflecting rebounded passenger traffic, and Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (BB/Stable), mirroring the outlook revision to the sovereign Kazakhstan (BBB-/Stable). We note there were no positive outlooks at year-end 2022 that have since been revised downward to stable.\n\nDespite a negative outlook bias, we maintain our view that credit quality in the rail sector is strong. Of railway and mass transit ratings, 79% remain investment-grade, while the median rating of 'BBB+' is robust against the transportation infrastructure portfolio median rating of 'BBB'. Improvements in ridership coupled with strong regulatory support have helped sustain debt service coverage and leverage metrics, and the large majority (approximately 81%) of outlooks remain stable.\n\nAirports\n\nRating distribution and changes\n\nAirports' credit strength has demonstrated resiliency through 2023 and thus far in 2024. The 'BBB+' median rating for airports fares well compared to the 'BBB' transportation infrastructure portfolio median. Similar to roads, we have witnessed substantial positive movement in the ratings. Since the end of 2022, 22% of the portfolio has been upgraded, while 72% has held stable. All six project finance ratings and all four North American ratings were affirmed investment grade, two of which are airport-related services. Several upgrades occurred globally, reflecting our view of solid industry recovery following the travel impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As air passenger traffic has progressed, so too have our expectations for profitability and cash flow metrics, thus bolstering credit quality. The upgrade to Aeropuertos Dominicanos Siglo XXI S.A. (BB/Stable) reflected this.\n\nThat said, in EMEA, airport ratings generally remain one to two notches below pre-pandemic levels, despite traffic having reached or surpassed 2019 levels. This is because leverage remains 20% higher on average compared to before the onset of the pandemic, which strained leverage metrics due to travel restrictions. Looking forward, we believe rating trajectories will be more company-specific, hinging on traffic levels, regulations and tariff increases, and capital expenditure plans and financial policies.\n\nIn APAC, we observed positive ratings trends--GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd. (BB/Stable) was upgraded on higher approved tariffs and robust traffic, while Delhi International Airport Ltd. (BB-/Positive) was upgraded in July 2023 to 'B+' from 'B' on the back of stronger traffic recovery and profitability, and subsequently again in May 2024 to the current 'BB-' rating due to expected higher tariffs underpinning material improvements in cash flow. Despite this, lagging international passenger traffic recovery at some APAC airports, compared to global averages, still weighs on cash flows.\n\nMeanwhile, Christchurch International Airport Ltd. (A-/Stable) benefitted from city council support, while Royal Schiphol Group N.V. (A/Positive) benefitted from stronger cash flows resulting from higher airport charges and a delay in implementing a cap on air traffic movements (ATMs).\n\nThe only downgrades within airports were to Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 S.A. (CCC/Stable), reflecting the transfer and convertibility (T&C) assessment for Argentina (CCC/Stable), rather than underlying troubles within the asset class; and Aeroports de Paris (A-/Stable), mirroring the sovereign rating.\n\nNew to the portfolio in 2023 is TAV Airports (BB-/Stable) an owner and operator of a portfolio of airports primarily in Turkiye and across EMEA, and part of Aeroports de Paris group. We rate TAV Airports above the sovereign rating on Turkiye (B+/Positive), reflecting the company's offshore cash reserves and geographic diversification.\n\nOutlook distribution and revisions\n\nThe outlook distribution for airports also saw a positive shift. Several airport credits experienced an outlook revision to stable from negative, including Gatwick Funding Ltd. (BBB/Stable) and daa PLC (A-/Stable), largely due to our expectations for air traffic improvements. The outlook for Delhi International Airport was revised to positive based on our expectation of higher approved tariffs, supported by solid passenger traffic recovery and higher profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, two credits bear a negative outlook, including Investimentos e Participacoes em Infraestrutura S.A. (CCC+/Negative), reflecting the project's reliance on the resolution of a judicial dispute to absolve liquidity pressures.\n\nPorts\n\nRating distribution and changes\n\nCompared to the rest of the transportation portfolio, ports show the weakest credit strength with the lowest proportion of investment-grade credits. The median rating for ports falls between 'BBB-' and 'BBB', compared to median ratings of 'BBB' or better for the rest of the transportation asset types. That said, we believe this reflects the relative competitiveness and volatility of the ports sector compared to other transportation sects, rather than issues or challenges characterizing 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe note that ports are the smallest group of the broken-out asset types, constituting only 11% of project finance and corporate transportation infrastructure ratings, and that our rated ports are largely concentrated in APAC. Additionally, we note that four ports in Asia categorized as availability-based derive their revenues through a take-or-pay (TOP) mechanism that supports stable revenues.\n\nDespite relative weakness compared to the broader portfolio, our group of rated ports demonstrated positive ratings movement. Since 2022, 74% of credits have held at the same rating level, while we upgraded 21% (four credits) and downgraded 5% (one credit). In 2023, China Merchants Port Holdings Co. Ltd. (BBB+/Stable) was upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' based on our view that it remains a highly strategic subsidiary; its parent, China Merchants Group, strengthened its credit profile because of its designation as a state capital investment company, which helps the central government develop and reform China's state-owned enterprises. We also upgraded Mersin International Port (BB-/Positive) one notch in December 2023 and an additional notch in May 2024, reflecting similar sovereign rating actions on Turkiye, while its stand-alone credit profile remains 'bbb-'.\n\nMeanwhile, we downgraded Port of Newcastle Investments (Financing) Pty Ltd. (BB+/Positive) to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' in September 2023. The rating action stemmed from a weakened financial profile due to softened coal volumes, lower earnings, and higher interest costs. We subsequently revised the outlook to positive in April 2024.\n\nOutlook distribution and revisions\n\nThe outlook distribution reflects positive developments in the ports sector. Of our rated portfolio, 79% remains stable, 16% (three credits) has a positive outlook, and 5% (one credit) has a negative outlook. We revised the outlook for Mersin International Port to positive in line with the outlook revision to positive for the sovereign Turkiye. Terminales Portuarios Euroandinos Paita S.A. (BB+/Positive) holds a positive outlook as high agricultural exports drive strong operating and financial performance, despite exposure to the negative effects of the climate event La Nina through the first half of 2024.\n\nThe positive outlook on Port of Newcastle Investments in April 2024 reflects our expectation for metrics to improve over the next two years as the company implements higher wharfage charges and maintains dividend restraint.\n\nThe outlook on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (BBB-/Positive) was revised to positive in June 2024 reflecting our view that its strong competitive position and diversification will support healthy cash flows. This follows our earlier outlook revision to stable in January 2024 reflecting the port's strong business fundamentals and robust cash flows, and our expectation it will not undertake significant related-party transactions outside the normal course of business. We had previously revised the outlook to negative in February 2023 to reflect the risk of a deterioration in the credit profile of Adani Ports due to governance risks and funding challenges for the larger Adani Group.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook revision to negative was on Autoridad del Canal de Panama (ACP; A-/Negative), reflecting the negative outlook on Panama. We affirm that ACP is rated the maximum number of notches above the sovereign foreign currency rating.\n\nProfitability\n\nProfitability has performed well across much of the portfolio since 2022, with steady revenues driving healthy profitability metrics, which support the investment-grade profile of our transportation infrastructure credits. Roads stand out as the most profitable of all transportation asset types, with a median CFADS margin of 68% and median EBITDA margin of 69% in 2023 (note that we use CFADS margin and EBITDA margin as profitability indicators for project finance and corporates, respectively). This is a trend we have seen in the past and continue to expect, considering the relatively low capital requirements to continue operations of toll roads and generally inflation-linked tariff mechanisms, coupled with the essential service provided. Healthy profitability has support from rebounded traffic volumes alongside the successful pass-through of inflationary costs to toll road users through higher tariffs. Additionally, for projects, a large portion have availability-based payment mechanisms, which helps bolster CFADS in the sector. We see projects continue to successfully fulfill their operational requirements, keeping deductions low. For our corporate roads issuers, healthy profitability has supported leverage below that of the portfolio as a whole (4.0x median debt to EBITDA for roads compared to 4.7x portfolio median).\n\nConversely, railways and mass transit continue to demonstrate weaker profitability compared to roads. This is largely due to the high costs associated with operating rail assets relative to the amount of revenue, large staffing costs, and affordability considerations built into fare regulation. Accordingly, median debt to EBITDA for rail issuers of 5.1x comes in above the 4.7x portfolio median.\n\nProfitability metrics for airports came in between roads and railroads, reflecting the complexity and costs of operations, which are much greater than that of roads but still less burdensome than railways. Airports currently maintain the highest leverage, with a median debt to EBITDA for airport issuers of 6.0x (compared to the portfolio median of 4.7x), which we believe stems from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the sector was the hardest hit by travel restrictions. However, recent healthy profitability for airports, with a median CFADS margin of 56% and median EBITDA margin of 44%, has supported deleveraging. We see this clearly in the large 22% of the portfolio having been upgraded since the start of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the pandemic least affected ports given their much lower reliance on passenger volumes, and EBITDA margins above 60% fare well. Accordingly, the sector performs the best on leverage, with a median debt to EBITDA of 2.8x for ports issuers compared to the portfolio median of 4.7x.\n\nS&P Global Ratings' Portfolio Of Transportation Infrastructure Ratings\n\nTable 1\n\nS&P Global Ratings' portfolio of project finance transportation transactions: Roads Entity name Region Rating and outlook as of July 19, 2024 Commercial operations/Earliest rating Entity summary OPBA Most recent forecast minimum DSCR (x)\n\n407 East Development Group G.P.\n\nNorth America A-/Stable 2019 The project was selected for an extension of Toronto-based Highway 407 under a design, build, finance, operate, and maintain mandate with the Ontario Infrastructure and Lands Corp. (IO; representing the Province of Ontario as off-taker). The project achieved substantial completion in June 2016. The project mainly consists of a 20.3-km, four- to six-lane divided expressway (the main line) and a 10-km, four-lane divided expressway connecting the main line to Highway 401, and a 5-km realignment of Highway 401. The major structures include 11 interchanges, 31 water crossings, and 16 road crossings. 1 1.20\n\n407 International Inc.\n\nNorth America A/Stable 2001 Toronto-based 407 International Inc. owns 100% of 407 ETR Concession Co. Ltd., which holds a 99-year lease to operate and maintain Highway 407. The highway is the world's first all-electronic, open-access, long toll highway, running 108 km just north and west of Toronto through some of the city's more congested areas. The highway consists of six-, eight-, and 10-lane sections (expandable to eight and 10 lanes in certain sections). The highway system provides congestion relief to the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) road network, attracting motorists willing to pay a toll away from busy toll-free alternate routes. 3 1.97\n\n95 Express Lanes LLC\n\nNorth America BBB/Stable 2014 95 Express Lanes operates and maintains about 40 miles of reversible managed lanes in the median of portions of I-95's general-purpose lanes in northern Virginia. It serves Washington, D.C., and its suburbs under a 73-year concession with the Virginia Department of Transportation. It opened to traffic in December 2014 and is 50% owned by Transurban Group, 25% by AustralianSuper, 15% by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and 10% by UniSuper. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the project outperformed our base-case financial forecast for toll revenue. The I-395 reversible managed lanes opened in fall 2019, which extended the I-95 express lanes for 8 miles. 7 2.11\n\nAberdeen Roads (Finance) PLC\n\nEMEA A/Stable 2019 Aberdeen Roads (Finance) PLC on-lent the proceeds of the £544 million senior debt issuance to Aberdeen Roads Ltd. (ProjectCo). ProjectCo used the proceeds to finance the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route/Balmedie to Tipperty (AWPR/B-T) in northern Scotland. The road opened fully to traffic in February 2019 and provides an alternative route from north to south Aberdeen. The AWPR/B-T comprises approximately 55 km of new dual carriageway and a small new section added to the existing A90 north of Aberdeen. ProjectCo operates under an availability-based project agreement with Aberdeen City Council. The concession has a duration of about 33 years and expires in 2047. 1 1.26\n\nAmey Roads NI Financial PLC\n\nEMEA BBB-/Stable 2007 U.K.-based special purpose entity Amey Roads NI Financial PLC issued £141.06 million of index-linked secured bonds, due in 2037, and raised £121.06 million of index-linked loan facilities from the European Investment Bank, due in 2035. The issuer on-lent the funds to Amey Roads NI Ltd., which used the proceeds to finance the design, construction, and operation of four complementary highway improvement schemes to the west of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The schemes comprised the construction of about 38 km of new roads together with the operation and maintenance of approximately 87 km of existing roads. 2 1.14\n\nAPP Coatzacoalcos Villahermosa S.A.P.I de C.V.\n\nLatin America mxBBB+/Positive 2017 APP operates 134 km of the Coatzacoalcos-Villahermosa section in the Federal Highway, located in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco in Mexico. The project has a 10-year PPP contract by the Transportation Ministry and receives monthly availability payments until 2027. 2 1.30\n\nAutopista del Sol Concesionaria Espanola S.A.\n\nEMEA BBB+/Stable 1999, 2002 Autopista del Sol Concesionaria Espanola S.A. (AUSOL), a limited-purpose entity, issued a €467 million fixed-rate senior secured bond and €40 million in senior secured notes, both due Dec. 30, 2045. AUSOL used the proceeds to refinance the debt incurred for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a 96- km section of tolled motorway southern Spain in the region of Andalucia. Part of the toll road has been operational since 1999 (75-km section known as AUSOL I) and part since 2002 (21-km section known as AUSOL II). AUSOL services its debt via the toll charged to users of the road. 5 1.78\n\nAutopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico LLC\n\nNorth America BBB/Positive 1972 Autopistas Metropolitanas consists of the 52-mile PR-22 and two-mile PR-5 toll highways, a network of flat roads, 127 simple bridges, and seven toll plazas serving the largely urbanized northeastern and northwestern regions of Puerto Rico near its capital. PR-22 and PR-5 began operating in 1972, and the project was awarded a long-term PPP concession in 2011. Passenger cars make up 96% of traffic. It operates under a 50-year term concession agreement granted by the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority.
