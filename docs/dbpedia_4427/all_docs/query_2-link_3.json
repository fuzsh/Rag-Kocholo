This rate rises to over 70% for people who are Pakistani, Other White British or Indian.\n\nThe proportion of Pakistanis and Indians who live in owned homes is higher than the overall Scottish figure for all age groups, with the exception of Indians aged 16-29 years.\n\nThe percentage of African and Black Scottish people aged 16 years and above who live in homes which are owned is less than 50%. There is however considerable variation in proportions between the different age groups. Only 26.5% of 16-29 year old Africans and 39.8% of 16-29 year old Caribbeans live in owned homes; this compares with an overall Scottish figure of 59.5%. The African group also has the lowest proportion of 30-49 year olds in owned homes (37.3%). However the proportion of Africans aged 75 and over who own their homes is much higher than the Scottish figure (61.9% versus 55.3%) and the rate for Caribbeans of this age is very similar to the Scottish figure (54.1% versus 55.3%).\n\nGiven the differences in ownership rates between different ethnic groups, there are obviously differences in the proportion of each group who live in rented accommodation. Taking all ages together, Africans, Other Ethnic group, and Black Scottish/Other Black are the groups who have the highest proportion of people living in rented accommodation 7. As well as the overall differences in the proportions who rent, there are considerable differences between ethnic groups in the proportion who rent from the social sector and those who rent privately.\n\nRented Accommodation\n\nTable 2.3: Rented accommodation by ethnic group - All People in Rented Accommodation\n\nPercentages\n\nMinority ethnic people are much less likely than White people to be renting in the public sector (Council, Scottish Homes, and Housing Associations).\n\n78% of White people rent their homes in the public sector compared to 48% of all minority ethnic people.\n\nNote: Social Rented accommodation includes those homes that are rented from the Council (or Scottish Homes), RSL and Housing Associations. Private Rented accommodation includes those homes that are rented from a private landlord or letting agency, employer of a household member, relatives or friends, and any others.\n\nOf those renting accommodation, 82% of White Scottish people rent from the public sector compared with only 30% of Indians and 31% of Other White people.\n\nTable 2.4 (below) provides a further breakdown of rented accommodation by social rented and private rented. There are large differences across the ethnic groups in relation to the types of rented accommodation.\n\nOnly 20% of Indians rent their accommodation from the Council or Scottish Homes. This compares with 67% of White Scottish people.\n\nConsequently, there are differences in the proportions renting from private landlords or letting agencies: 56% of Indians rent privately compared to only 12% of White Scottish people.\n\nOnly a very small number of people rent their accommodation from relatives or friends; Pakistani (8%) and Chinese (8%) have the highest percentage renting from relatives or friends.\n\nTable 2.4: Rented Accommodation by ethnic group - All People in Rented Accommodation\n\nPercentages\n\nNotes: RSL is an abbreviation for Registered Social Landlords.\n\nCommunal Establishments\n\nTable 2.5: People living in communal establishments by ethnic group - All People\n\nPercentages\n\nThe Chinese, African and Other White groups have the highest percentage of people living in communal establishments: 6.1%, 6.0% and 5.9%. This compares with 0.5% of Pakistanis and 1.4% of White Scottish people who live in communal establishments.\n\nThe White Irish, White Scottish and Other White groups have the highest percentage of people living in medical and care establishments with 1.2%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.\n\n5.8% of Chinese people are living in non-medical communal establishments.\n\nOccupancy rating\n\nThe occupancy rating as calculated by GROS relates the actual number of rooms in a household to the number required by that household based on the ages of the household members and the relationship between them. A positive occupancy rating (i.e. 1 or 2+ or more) indicates that there are more rooms than are 'required' by that household. A rating of zero indicates the actual number of rooms to be the same as the number required and a negative rating (-1 or less) indicates less rooms than are 'required'. Chart 2.2 shows the percentage of households from each ethnic group within each occupancy rating band.\n\nPakistani and Bangladeshi households have the highest incidence of households living below the occupancy rating standard (31%). The African group has the second highest proportion (30%).\n\nThe Other White British group has the lowest proportion of households living below that occupancy rating standard (7%).\n\nCentral Heating\n\nChart 2.3 shows the percentage of households from each ethnic group who have central heating. The Census describes a household as 'with central heating' if it has central heating in some or all rooms whether used or not."
