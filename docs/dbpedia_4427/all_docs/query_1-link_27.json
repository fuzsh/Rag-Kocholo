        "text": "Multi-criteria Evaluation\n\nA multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) has been undertaken to combine variables associated with fuel poverty, at local authority level and data zone level to establish where heat demand is highest across Scotland.\n\nThe methodology used to create a heat demand map from a MCE was used by Heywood et al., (2011):\n\nDefine the problem\n\nDetermine the criteria\n\nStandardise the factors\n\nDetermine the weight of each factor\n\nAggregate the data for the final output\n\nEach varable is made up a number of indicators and target residents in fuel poverty and deprivation. Indicators were weighted and combined within raster calculator of ArcGIS to create an output map for each variable (Figure 1). Variables were further weighted and combined to produce final output maps of heat demand. The variables used within local authority analysis are shown below:\n\nDeprivation\n\nType of Housing\n\nDwelling ownership\n\nHousing energy efficiency\n\nEnergy consumption\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe intention for the methodology and results from this study is to inspire local authorities to undertake similar analysis, to define where fuel poverty is highest and if there is potential for geothermal energy to be utilised. By combining fuel poverty and deprivation heat demand with energy use data from Scotland�s Heat Map (2015) future work may involve routing of pipelines to create district heat networks within the extent of geothermal extraction. Local heat networks are an emerging technology with support from the Scottish Government (Scottish Government, 2014b). Although an advantageous solution, heat networks are easier to implement prior to infrastructure development and can be expensive developments. The National Planning Framework (NPF) publishes potential developments across Scotland for the next 20 � 30 years and is updated every five years (Scottish Government, 2014a). The most recent, National Planning Framework 3 was released on June 23rd, 2014. Each local authority also produces a future development plan, which typically covers a shorter time frame of five to ten years and can easily be found on the relevant local authority web pages (Fife Council, 2012). Where analysis from this research correlates with future potential developments, district heat networks should be considered prior to development in order to reduce costs and inconvenience as well as contributing towards two key targets of Scotland�s 2020 energy aims � providing 11% of heat demand from renewable energy and 1TWh of heat to be delivered by district heating by 2020 (Scottish Government, 2014a).\n\nAlthough there is evidence to suggest geothermal energy can contribute to a large proportion of Scotland�s heat demand, it cannot be used alone. Biomass, biological material derived from organisms can be used to produce heat through combustion. Currently out of the 18% of renewable heat produced within Scotland, over half is produced from biomass (Scottish Government, 2015). Waste heat as a result from industrial activity, known as industrial heat decarbonisation also has the potential to be utilised and recycled within a heat network in order to lower heat demand. This dissertation has solely focussed on geothermal energy however an analysis of the use of other heat sources could also be undertaken within future analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis dissertation has built on previous work undertaken to visualise energy use across Scotland by combining a number of variables with reference to fuel poverty and weighting them appropriately in order to visualise the areas with the highest fuel poverty. The variables chosen were gathered from literature in terms of fuel poverty and deprivation and further submitted to statistical analysis in order to correlate with heat demand. Statistical analysis was a new technique utilised within the MCE, reducing the chance of researcher bias whereby producing a precise and reliable analysis. The methodology used for the MCE allowed for a number of indicators to be combined at the same scale in order to produce a final output map successfully displaying the local authorities with the highest heat demand throughout Scotland.\n\nExpanding on the results at local authority level, a case study analysis was undertaken to demonstrate the same methodology can be undertaken at a finer scale such as data zones. With this information, local authorities can target and prioritise appropriate locations with renewable energy, such as geothermal energy, to meet Scotland�s 2020 energy targets and improve the lives of Scottish residents. Results from this analysis can be taken further in the future by incorporating subsurface data on geothermal temperatures at depth in order to decipher the most suitable locations for geothermal extraction.\n\nReferences\n\nBGS (2013) Deep geothermal energy potential in Scotland, [online].
