section (in this section and section 56 referred to as a “tenant management co-operative”) may make an agreement with a landlord mentioned in section 11(1)(b) for the exercise by the co-operative of the landlord’s housing functions.\n\n(2)The Scottish Ministers must approve a society, company or body of trustees for the purposes of this section if they are satisfied that it is generally suitable to carry out such functions.\n\n(3)Where a tenant management co-operative applies to a landlord referred to in subsection (1) for agreement to the co-operative exercising, on such terms as the application may specify, all or part of the landlord’s housing functions, the landlord must make an agreement with the co-operative if it is satisfied that—\n\n(a)the co-operative is approved under subsection (2),\n\n(b)the co-operative will be able to exercise the functions specified in the proposal competently and efficiently, and\n\n(c)so far as those functions relate to houses, the

in subsection (3)(b) or (c), the co-operative may appeal to the Scottish Ministers, who may confirm or reverse the landlord’s decision.\n\n(5)Where the Scottish Ministers reverse the landlord’s decision, the landlord and the co-operative must make the agreement.\n\n(6)Where the landlord and the co-operative are unable to agree the terms of the agreement, the co-operative may appeal to the Scottish Ministers who may determine the terms of the agreement.\n\n(7)An agreement under this section may be made only with the approval of the Scottish Ministers, and such approval may be given subject to conditions.\n\n(8)An agreement under this section does not affect the responsibility of the local authority landlord or registered social landlord for the exercise of its functions.\n\nCommencement Information\n\n56 Tenant management agreements: further provision S\n\n(1)An agreement under section 55 may be made in relation to—\n\n(a)all or any part of the landlord’s housing functions,\n\n(b)all or any part of the houses held by the landlord for the purposes of those functions.\n\n(2)In that section and this section, references to the landlord’s housing functions

Act,\n\n(ii)under sections 4 and 5 (power to provide furniture, board and laundry facilities) of that Act, in connection with any such land or interest,\n\n(b)in relation to a registered social landlord, references to its housing activities within the meaning of section 83(3),\n\n(c)in relation to [Scottish Water] , references to its functions in relation to the provision and management of houses.\n\n(3)An agreement under section 55 between a tenant management co-operative and a local authority landlord may, without prejudice to any other enactment, include terms providing for the letting of land to the co-operative by the landlord for a period not exceeding 20 years.\n\n(4)A local authority must continue to include in its housing revenue account houses on land included in an agreement under that section between a tenant management co-operative and a local authority landlord; and neither the making of the agreement nor any letting of land in pursuance of it is to be treated as a ground for the reduction, suspension or discontinuance of any Exchequer contribution or subsidy under section 202 of the 1987 Act.\n\n(5)In subsection (4), “Exchequer contribution” has the meaning given in section 338(1) of the 1987 Act.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nCommencement Information\n\nPART 3 S REGULATION OF SOCIAL LANDLORDS\n\nCHAPTER 1 S REGISTERED SOCIAL

longer apply to that local authority by virtue of an order made under section 94 of this Act,\n\n(c)the Scottish Ministers are satisfied that it is appropriate for RSL 1 to authorise another registered social landlord to exercise any of RSL 1's housing management functions if RSL 1 is to manage its houses in a manner which is consistent with the spirit of any notice served on tenants for the purposes of paragraph 3(2) or (3) of schedule 9 in relation to the disposal, and\n\n(d)less than 5 years have passed since this section came into force.\n\n(2)Where subsection (1) applies, the Scottish Ministers may direct RSL 1 to authorise another registered social landlord (“RSL 2”) to exercise such of RSL 1's housing management functions as may be specified in the direction in place of RSL 1 on such terms, if any, as may be so specified; and both RSL 1 and RSL 2 must comply with the direction.\n\n(3)RSL 1 may not, while a direction under subsection (2) remains in force, authorise any person other than RSL 2 to exercise any functions specified in the direction.\n\n(4)A direction made under subsection (2) must be published in such manner as the Scottish Ministers think fit.\n\n(5)Any authorisation given in pursuance of a direction made under subsection (2) continues to have effect for so long as the direction has effect.\n\n(6)A direction made under subsection (2)
