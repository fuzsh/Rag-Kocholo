        "text": "by Emily Widra Tweet this\n\nJune 2024\n\nThe U.S. has the highest incarceration rate of any independent democracy on earth — worse, every single state incarcerates more people per capita than most nations. In the global context, even “progressive” U.S. states like New York and Massachusetts appear as extreme as Louisiana and Mississippi in their use of prisons and jails.\n\nFigure 1. This graph shows the number of people in state prisons, local jails, federal prisons, and other systems of confinement from each U.S. state and territory per 100,000 people in that state or territory and the incarceration rate per 100,000 in all countries with a total population of at least 500,000.\n\nThe graphic above charts the incarceration rates of every U.S. state and territory alongside those of the other nations of the world. Looking at each state in the global context reveals that, in every part of the country, incarceration is out of step with the rest of the world.\n\nIf we imagine every state as an independent nation, as in the graph above, every state appears extreme. While El Salvador has an incarceration rate higher than any U.S. state,1 nine states have the next highest incarceration rates in the world, followed by Cuba. Overall, 24 U.S. states and three nations (El Salvador, Cuba, and Rwanda)2 have incarceration rates even higher than the national incarceration rate of the United States. Massachusetts, the state with the lowest incarceration rate in the nation, would rank 30th in the world with an incarceration rate higher than Iran, Colombia, and all the founding NATO nations.\n\nIn fact, many of the countries that rank alongside the least punitive U.S. states, such as Turkmenistan, Belarus, Russia, and Azerbaijan, have authoritarian or dictatorial governments, but the U.S. — the land of the free — still incarcerates more people per capita than almost every other nation. Importantly, high incarceration rates have little impact on violence and crime.\n\nBut how does the U.S. compare in the global context? Next to our closest international peers, our use of incarceration is off the charts:\n\nConclusion\n\nFor decades, the U.S. has been engaged in a globally unprecedented experiment to make every part of its criminal legal system more expansive and more punitive. As a result, incarceration has become the nation’s default response to crime, with, for example, 70 percent of convictions resulting in confinement3 — far more than other developed nations with comparable crime rates.4 As we’ve discussed, the U.S.’ high incarceration rates are not a rational response to high crime rates. Instead, they represent the aftermath of racist policies like the “war on drugs,” as well as politically expedient responses to public fears and perceptions about crime and violence.\n\nToday, the United States is at an inflection point. In 2020, after protests of the murder of George Floyd, some glimmers of hope emerged that the country was finally ready to end the failed experiment of mass incarceration. However, more recently, many public officials have called for a return to the harmful policies of the past. The choices made in the coming years will determine whether the United States will finally bring its incarceration rate in line with the other nations that it considers its peers. For that, all states will have to aim higher, striving to be not just better than the worst U.S. states, but among the most fair and just in the world.\n\nEditors note: This report was updated on July 11, 2024 to correct a mathematical error in the calculation of the overall, national incarceration rate of the United States.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAll Prison Policy Initiative reports are collaborative endeavors, but this report builds on the successful collaborations of the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021 versions. The Prison Policy Initiative is grateful for data artist Josh Begley’s original visual structure and for the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research’s aggregated world incarceration data in the invaluable World Prison Brief.\n\nThis report was made possible thanks to the generous support of our individual donors across the country who support justice reform.\n\nAbout the author\n\nEmily Widra is a Senior Research Analyst at the Prison Policy Initiative. She is the organization’s expert on health and safety issues behind bars, including the coronavirus in prisons and HIV prevalence in prisons. Her other research includes examining the high mortality rates of people on probation and parole, highlighting the counterproductive practice of locking up older adults, and assessing how prisons and jails provide punishment instead of treatment for people who use substances.\n\nAbout the Prison Policy Initiative\n\nThe non-profit, non-partisan Prison Policy Initiative was founded in 2001 to expose the broader harm of mass criminalization and spark advocacy campaigns to create a more just society. The organization is known for its visual breakdown of mass incarceration in the U.S., as well as its data-rich analyses of how U.S. states vary in their use of punishment. Alongside reports like these, the organization leads the nation’s fight to keep the prison system from exerting undue influence on the political process (a.k.a. prison gerrymandering) and played a leading role in protecting the families of incarcerated people from the predatory prison and jail telephone industry and the video calling industry."
