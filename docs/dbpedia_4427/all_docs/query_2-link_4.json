        "text": "A communal establishment is an establishment providing managed residential accommodation. ‘Managed’ in this context means full-time or part-time supervision of the accommodation.\n\nTypes of communal establishment include:\n\nSheltered accommodation units where fewer than 50 per cent of the units in the establishment have their own cooking facilities, or similar accommodation where residents have their own rooms, but the main meal is provided. If half or more possess their own facilities for cooking (regardless of use) all units in the whole establishment are treated as separate households.\n\nSmall hotels, guest houses, bed & breakfasts, inns and pubs with residential accommodation with room for 10 or more guests (excluding the owner/manager and his/her family).\n\nAll accommodation provided solely for students (during term-time). This includes university-owned cluster flats, houses and apartments located within student villages, and similar accommodation owned by a private company and provided solely for students. (University-owned student houses that were difficult to identify and not clearly located with other student residences are treated as households, and houses rented to students by private landlords are also treated as households.) Accommodation available only to students may include a small number of care-taking or maintenance staff, or academic staff.\n\nAccommodation available only to nurses. This includes cluster flats and similar accommodation, provided solely for nurses. Nurses’ accommodation on a hospital site that does not also contain patients is treated as a separate communal establishment from the hospital (and not categorised as a hospital), so that nurses are treated as ‘residents’ and not ‘resident staff’ or ‘patients’. This ensures consistency with similar nurses’ accommodation not on a hospital site.\n\nKey statistics:\n\nKS405SC - Communal establishment residents\n\nQuick statistics:\n\nQS420SC - Communal establishment management and type - Communal establishments\n\nQS421SC - Communal establishment management and type - People\n\nDetailed characteristics:\n\nDC3402SCca - Long-term health problem or disability by communal establishment type by age\n\nDC4112SC - Living arrangements of young adults by sex\n\nDC4211SCca - Communal establishment type by ethnic group\n\nDC4414SCca - Communal establishment type by type of resident by sex by age\n\nDC4801SCca - Communal establishment type by resident type and whether or not resident one year ago\n\nDC6108SC - Economic activity of full-time students by student accommodation by age\n\n(ESTNATURES11 provides a slightly more detailed breakdown of establishment type than CECTMCS11. Detailed Characteristics tables make use of this information to sub-divide education establishments into ‘Halls of residence and student accommodation’ and ‘Schools and other education establishments’.)\n\nThis variable describes the nature of the establishment.\n\nIt is based on the responses to the questions below. In addition there is a box for enumerator use only which is ticked for persons sleeping rough.\n\nYour feedback will help us improve this website.
