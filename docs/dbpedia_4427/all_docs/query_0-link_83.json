It places particular emphasis on the cultural scars of this process as witnessed through miners' and managers' memories, positioning these within the context of occupational socialization, conflict, and alienation. The piece explores the enduring importance of these cultural scars in shaping broader collective narratives of decline in Scotland, and how responses were manifest in shifting political outlooks and the emergence (at both a local and national level) of a resurgent nationalism from the early 1960s onward. Drawing on the notion of the “cultural circuit,” the article examines how and why personal experience of the loss of the coal industry informed and conformed to the politics of the miners' union in Scotland, the National Union of Mineworkers Scottish Area (NUMSA). As the article makes clear, the program of closures in the industry has left profound psychological scars in coalfield communities—ones that, like the closure of other major industrial sites, shape a powerful national narrative.\n\nType\n\nCrumbling Cultures: Deindustrialization, Class, and Memory\n\nInformation\n\nInternational Labor and Working-Class History , Volume 84: Crumbling Cultures: Deindustrialization, Class, and Memory , Fall 2013 , pp. 78 - 98\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0147547913000252 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © International Labor and Working-Class History, Inc. 2013\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Ibid., 63, 85; One obvious and plausible explanation for this discrepancy over the issue of privatization is self-interest, in view of Scotland's greater reliance on public sector jobs, and the much higher levels of municipal housing occupation, as opposed to private home ownership. For example, public housing construction in Scotland between 1967 and 1970 surpassed even that of Soviet-bloc countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland. However, associated with higher levels of state intervention were collective social norms and values. Equally, Thatcherism further encouraged civic nationalism in Scotland, allying the labor movement, churches, and other public organizations with a national agenda. This was characterized by a distinct national cultural movement in support of communality and in contradistinction to privatization and individualization. See, for example, Knox, W.

One illustration of this is to be found in the association of the closure of Ravenscraig strip mill in 1992 with Margaret Thatcher's premiership when she had resigned in 1990. However, Thatcher, by dint of association with the public policy of not supporting “white elephants” in industry and through her government's appointment of Ian MacGregor as chairman of British Steel (MacGregor went on to impose deep cuts in the industry), remained closely connected to this. Even if the dates do not coincide with Thatcher's reign, the origins of this policy direction, as well as the political rhetoric, does; Portelli, Alessandro, The Death of Luigi Trastulli and Other Stories: Form and Meaning in Oral History (New York, 1991), 51Google Scholar.\n\n17\n\n17.
