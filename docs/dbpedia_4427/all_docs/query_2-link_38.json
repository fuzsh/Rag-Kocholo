        "text": "RCVS Riding Establishment Inspections\n\nUnder the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018 for England and Riding Establishments Acts 1964 and 1970 for Scotland and Wales, riding establishments are required by law to be licensed by local authorities.\n\nThe licence may only be issued or denied by the local authority following an inspection and report by a veterinary surgeon who is a member of the RCVS Inspectorate.\n\nEnvironmental Health departments of local authorities have responsibility for enforcing health and safety legislation in the majority of riding establishments. They investigate reportable accidents and undertake health and safety inspections which they may carry out during licensing visits. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health Officers (CIEH) have published comprehensive guidance on relevant legislation, suggested control measures etc intended for use by enforcement officers, proprietors and other interested parties, available free to download from the CIEH site.\n\nRiding Establishment Inspectors and working donkeys\n\nThere could be as many as 1,000 working donkeys in the UK, mostly found around our coastline. Recently, however, more ventures using donkeys for riding other than beach are appearing, such as fairs and children’s parties. Any vet registered as an inspector may be called upon by the local authority to complete the annual inspection of licensed riding establishments in their locality.\n\nRidden-donkey operations should be inspected with the same care and attention given to horse riding stables and are licensed under the same Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018 or Riding Establishments Acts of 1964 and 1970.\n\nDonkeys are different from horses, and beach donkey riding is a seasonal business. These and other factors need to be taken into account when planning and performing the inspection.\n\nMore information can be found on working donkeys on the Donkey Sanctuary website.\n\nRiding Establishments Inspectorate List and other useful documents\n\nThe list of approved riding establishment inspectors can be viewed below.\n\nRiding Establishments Inspectorate List\n\nLicensing authorities and their inspectors should use the forms of application and inspection report below.\n\nAn updated Riding Establishment Veterinary Inspector's Form (England) and Guidelines (England) have been uploaded. The updates have been made in line with the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018 and the associated DEFRA guidance. The form can be used for both full and interim inspections while we await further clarification from DEFRA as to the remit of the interim inspections.
