        "text": "What the legislation says:\n\n3. The carrying on of any of the following operations—\n\n(a) burning as a fuel, under a permit granted under the 2000 Regulations, of—\n\n(i) straw, poultry litter or wood;\n\n(ii) waste oil listed in Table 1 (including waste oil which is special waste); or\n\n(iii) solid fuel which has been manufactured from waste by a process involving the application of heat, to the extent that it is or forms part of an activity within Part B of any Section of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2000 Regulations;\n\n(b) the secure storage on any premises of any wastes mentioned in sub paragraph (a), other than waste oil, which are intended to be burned as mentioned in that sub paragraph, and the feeding of such wastes into an appliance in which they are to be so burned;\n\n(c) the secure storage of waste oil listed in Table 1 (including waste oil which is special waste) at the place where it is produced for a period not exceeding 12 months if the waste oil is intended to be submitted to an operation covered by the exemption conferred by sub paragraph (a); and provided that the total volume of that oil does not at any time exceed 23,000 litres;\n\n(d) burning as a fuel, under an authorisation granted under a permit granted under the 2000 Regulations, of tyres to the extent that it is or forms part of an activity within Part B of Section 1.1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2000 Regulations, and the shredding and feeding of tyres into an appliance in which they are to be so burned;\n\n(e) the secure storage on any premises of tyres where—\n\n(i) the tyres are intended to be submitted to an operation covered by the exemption conferred by sub paragraph (d);\n\n(ii) the tyres are stored separately;\n\n(iii) none of the tyres is stored on the premises for longer than 12 months; and\n\n(iv) the number of the tyres stored on the premises does not at any time exceed 1,000.\n\nTable 1\n\nCodes* Types of waste\n\n* Codes referred to in the European Waste Catalogue.\n\n** Includes special waste.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited but it can be de-registered by SEPA if it is not managed properly and no longer fulfills the criteria requirements of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health. If the activity does comply with the exemption criteria the registration will not have to be renewed except where there is a significant change to the activity.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n5 - (1) Burning of biomass waste or animal carcasses to the extent that doing so is, or forms part of, an activity falling within paragraphs (a) or (b) of Part B of Section 5.1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2012 Regulations.\n\n(2) The secure storage of waste intended to be submitted to such burning.\n\n(3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply only where—\n\n(a) the plant is not located in an air quality management area designated under section 83 of the 1995 Act; and\n\n(b) the waste is stored and burned in accordance with the requisite planning permission (if any).\n\n(4) The recovery, from waste vegetable oils (within category 20 01 25 of the European Waste Catalogue), of fuel for use in an engine of an aircraft, hovercraft, mechanically propelled vehicle, railway locomotive, ship or other vessel, or in appliances described in sub paragraph (1).\n\n(5) The secure storage of—\n\n(a) such waste vegetable oil prior to the carrying out of the fuel recovery process, and\n\n(b) waste produced by the fuel recovery process.\n\n(6) Sub paragraph (4) or, as the case may be, (5) applies only where—\n\n(a) the fuel recovery process is conducted in equipment manufactured for this purpose;\n\n(b) the total quantity of waste (including waste produced by the fuel recovery process) stored at any one time does not exceed 23,000 litres;\n\n(c) no waste is stored for longer than 12 months;\n\n(d) waste produced by the fuel recovery process is stored at the place where it is produced;\n\n(e) accurate records (including information about sources, volumes and destinations) are maintained by the holder and processor of both the waste vegetable oil and the recovered fuel; and\n\n(f) the fuel recovery process is not carried out for commercial purposes on an industrial scale, and in any case no more than 200 tonnes of recovered fuel is produced by the fuel recovery process in any calendar year.\n\nWhat this means:\n\nParagraph 5 (1) permits wastes to be used as a fuel in an appliance or appliances that are exempt appliances under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000.\n\nParagraph 5 (2) allows storage of the wastes that are to be used as a fuel.\n\nParagraph 5 (3) provides that burning can not be carried out in a designated Air Quality Management Zone.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required. This exemption can be registered online. However, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited and does not require renewal. However, it can be removed from the register by SEPA if the activity no longer fulfills the criteria of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health.\n\nQ. What can you do?\n\nA. You can use some specific wastes to generate heat or power in an appliance or appliances with a throughput of up to 50kg/hr. Activities with a throughput of 50kg/hr or greater require a PPC Permit. If this is the case, please contact your local SEPA office for further advice.\n\nQ. What wastes can you use?\n\nA. You can only burn ‘biomass’ wastes as defined in the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012. Further, to qualify for the exemption you must also make sure that the waste burns cleanly and does not pollute or cause a nuisance. Please see our guidance TG22 for more information about biomass combustion.\n\nQ. Can I clear the waste from a site and burn waste in a metal container such as a skip to dispose of it?\n\nA. No, a Paragraph 5 exemption applies to the burning of waste as a fuel and not for disposal. Disposing of a limited amount of wood, bark and plant matter by burning in the open is permitted under the Paragraph 30 exemption.\n\nQ. Where can I store the waste fuel?\n\nA. In the place or places that you identified when you registered the exemption. The storage must be secure so that waste cannot escape and access to it is controlled.\n\nQ. How can I find out if I am in an Air Quality Management Zone?\n\nA. You can find out if you are in an Air Quality Management Zone by going to the Air Quality in Scotland websiteand selecting your local authority for the most up to date map.\n\nExamples of activities not suitable for registration under the Paragraph 5 (1) exemption:\n\nA waste transfer station separates out combustible wastes and burns them in a small skip - The burning of waste for disposal is not permitted by this exemption.\n\nA garage collects and stores waste oil, which it filters and feeds into a small waste oil burner for heating - The burning of waste oil is not covered by the Paragraph 5 exemption. Waste oil must only be burned in specialist incinerators which comply with Chapter IV of the Industrial Emissions Directive.\n\nCompany burns confidential, paper waste in an appliance that provides hot water for a building - The burning of waste paper is not covered by the Paragraph 5 exemption. Waste paper must only be burned in specialist incinerators which comply with Chapter IV of the Industrial Emissions Directive.\n\nExamples of activities suitable for registration under the Paragraph 5 (1) exemption:\n\nA joinery workshop burning particle board off-cuts for space heating. Particleboard (MDF, OSB and chipboard) where they have not been treated with coatings or preservatives containing heavy metals or halogenated organic compounds fall within the definition of ‘biomass’ and so are suitable for use as fuel under Paragraph 5(1).\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n7. -(1) The treatment with any of the wastes listed in Table 2 of land used for agriculture where such treatment results in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement.\n\n(2) The treatment with any of the wastes listed in Part I of Table 2 of—\n\n(a) operational land of a railway, light railway, Scottish Water or British Waterways; or\n\n(b) land which is a forest, woodland, park, garden, verge, landscaped area, sports ground, recreation ground, churchyard or cemetery; where the land in question is not used for agriculture and such treatment results in ecological improvement.\n\nTable 2 Codes* Types of waste\n\nPART I Wastes from agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (02 01)\n\n02 01 03\n\nPlant-tissue waste\n\nWastes from sugar processing (02 04)\n\n02 04 01\n\nSoil from cleaning and washing beet\n\nWastes from wood processing and the production of panels and furniture (03 01)\n\n03 01 01\n\nWaste bark and cork\n\n03 01 05\n\nSawdust shavings, cuttings, wood, particle board***\n\nWastes from pulp, paper and cardboard production and processing (03 03)\n\n03 03 01\n\nWaste bark and wood (including virgin pulp)\n\nSoil (including excavated soil from contaminated sites), stones and dredging spoil (17 05)\n\n17 05 04\n\nSoil and stones**\n\n17 05 06\n\nDredging spoil***\n\nWastes from aerobic treatment of solid wastes (19 05)\n\n19 05 03\n\nOff-specification compost consisting only of biodegradable waste***\n\nWastes from anaerobic treatment of waste (19 06) 19 06 04 Digestate consisting only of biodegradable waste*** 19 06 06 Digestate from anaerobic treatment of animal and vegetable waste\n\nGarden and park wastes (including cemetery waste) (20 02)\n\n20 02 01\n\nBiodegradable waste\n\n20 02 02\n\nSoil and stones\n\nPART II Wastes from agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (02 01)\n\n02 01 99\n\nStraw, wood or paper-based bedding waste, slurry or dirty water from stables, zoos, animal parks or livestock markets, animal faeces, urine and manure***\n\nWastes from the preparation and processing of meat, fish and other foods of animal origin (02 02)\n\n02 02 03\n\nMaterials unsuitable for consumption or processing consisting of blood and gut contents from abattoirs, poultry preparation plants or fish preparation plants;

Registration \"expires\" after 12 months unless a renewal notice has been received and registered by SEPA. A renewal notice should be submitted to SEPA at least 21 days before the registration is due to \"expire\".\n\nThere are two options to use to submit the notification. Both methods require evidence to support agricultural benefit and there are two options to provide this. You only need to pick one option.\n\nOption 1 – is a new process that uses the Agricultural benefit Calculator (ABC) to help operators and SEPA assess the agricultural benefit. The ABC is an Excel spreadsheet which is completed by the operator. The ABC replaces the requirement for statement of agricultural benefit.\n\nOption 2 – enables a notification to be submitted using statements of agricultural benefit. This is similar to the old existing process.\n\nSEPA’s preferred method is for notifications to be submitted using the ABC tool - Option 1. However, SEPA will still accept notifications submitted using the agricultural statements – Option 2.\n\nNotification Form, ABC and Guidance:\n\nFurther information on Agricultural Benefit & Ecological Improvement can be found in Schedule 2 of the Waste Management Licensing (Scotland) Regulations 2011.\n\nWhere an exempt activity relates to the storage, treatment or recovery of waste then operating out with the parameters specified for that activity may indicate that a waste disposal activity is taking place. In these circumstances, the activity would no longer be exempt and you may have to cease the activity or remove some or all of the waste or apply for an appropriate authorisation. From 1 April 2015 onwards , if you deposit waste or place it for storage on or under land (or on a structure set into the surface of the land), you may also be liable to pay Scottish Landfill Tax if the activity purportedly being carried out under an exemption actually constitutes a disposal of the waste by way of landfill.\n\nNote - From 1 April 2015, many landfill activities in Scotland will be liable for Scottish Landfill Tax (SLfT). For further information on SLfT, please visit the Revenue Scotland website or contact SEPA.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n8. —(1) The storage in a secure container or lagoon (or, in the case of dewatered sludge, in a secure place) of sludge which is intended to be used\n\n(a) in accordance with the 1989 Regulations; or\n\n(b) for land treatment in reliance upon the exemption conferred by sub paragraph (2).\n\n(2) The treatment with sludge of land which is not agricultural land within the meaning of the 1989 Regulations if–\n\n(a) it results in ecological improvement, or in the case of the treatment of land used for non-food crops not grown in short term rotation with food crops, it enhances the growth of those crops; and\n\n(b) it does not cause the concentration in the soil of any of the elements listed in column 1 of the soil table set out in Schedule 2 to the 1989 Regulations to exceed the limit specified in the corresponding entry in column 2 of the table.\n\n(3) Sub paragraph (1) applies only if the following conditions are satisfied:–\n\n(a) the sludge is stored at the place where it is to be used;\n\n(b) the sludge is stored at a distance of not less than–\n\n(i) 10 metres from any inland or coastal waters;\n\n(ii) 50 metres from any well, borehole or similar work sunk into underground strata for the purpose of any water supply other than a domestic water supply; and\n\n(iii) 250 metres from any well, borehole or similar work sunk into underground strata for the purpose of a domestic water supply;\n\n(c) no sludge is stored to the extent that the volume stored exceeds ninety per cent of the available capacity of the container or lagoon where the storage takes place; and\n\n(d) no sludge is stored for longer than 6 months.\n\n(4) For the purpose of this paragraph, enhancement of crop growth or ecological improvement shall be construed in accordance with Schedule 2 to, and any guidance issued under regulation 17(11) of, these Regulations.\n\n(5) In this paragraph–\n\n(a) \"the 1989 Regulations\" means the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989 (\"the 1989 Regulations\");\n\n(b) \"domestic water supply\" has the meaning given by paragraph 7(5);and\n\n(c) \"sludge\" has the meaning given by regulation 2(1) of the 1989 Regulations, and \"used\", in relation to sludge, has the meaning given by that regulation.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\n8(1) - Storage of sludge\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required. This exemption can be registered online and does not have to be renewed.\n\n8(2) - Spreading of sludge\n\nMust be notified to SEPA using the appropriate form and enclosing the correct fee.\n\nRegistration \"expires\" after 12 months unless a renewal notice has been received and registered by SEPA.

For further information on SLfT, please visit the Revenue Scotland website or contact SEPA.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n13. —(1) The manufacture from–\n\n(a) waste which arises from demolition or construction work or tunnelling or other excavations; or\n\n(b) waste which consists of ash, slag, clinker, rock, wood, bark, paper, straw, crushed glass or gypsum, digestate consisting only of biodegradable waste or compost consisting only of biodegradable waste,\n\nof timber products, straw board, plasterboard, bricks, blocks, roadstone, soil, soil substitutes or aggregate.\n\n(2) The treatment of waste soil or rock or digestate consisting only of biodegradable waste which, when treated, is to be spread on land under paragraph 7 or 9, if–\n\n(a) it is carried out at the place where the waste is produced or the treated product is to be spread; and\n\n(b) the total amount treated at that place in any day does not exceed 100 tonnes.\n\n(3) The storage of waste which is to be submitted to any of the activities mentioned in sub paragraphs (1) and (2) if–\n\n(a) the waste is stored at the place where the activity is to be carried out; and\n\n(b) the total quantity of waste stored at that place at any time does not exceed–\n\n(i) in the case of the manufacture of roadstone from road planings, 50,000 tonnes; or\n\n(ii) in any other case, 20,000 tonnes.\n\n(4) In this paragraph—\n\n“digestate” means a stable, sanitised material converted from the inputs to the process of controlled decomposition of waste under managed conditions where free oxygen is absent, at temperatures suitable for naturally occurring mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria species;\n\n“compost” means a stable, sanitised material resulting from the autothermic and thermophilic biological decomposition and stabilisation of biodegradable waste in controlled aerobic conditions.\n\nWhat this means:\n\nParagraph 13 (1) (a & b) permits a limited range of wastes to be used in the manufacture of certain materials. You can use demolition, construction, tunnelling and excavation wastes or waste ash, slag, clinker, rock, wood, bark, paper, straw and gypsum in the manufacture of timber products, straw board, plasterboard, brick roadstone and aggregate provided the waste used is non-hazardous.\n\nParagraph 13 (2) allows up to 100 tonnes per day of waste soil or rock to be treated in order to produce materials that will be fit for use under either a paragraph 7 or paragraph 9 land spreading exemptions. The waste must be processed at the place where it originated or at the place where it will be spread. A seperate registration is required to spread the wastes under Paragraph 7 or 9.\n\nParagraph 13 (3) allows 20,000 tonnes of wastes which are to be used in the ways described in paragraph 13 (1 – 2), to be stored at the place where they will be used. In the case of road planings which are to be used in the manufacture of roadstone, this is increased to 50,000 tonnes.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited but it can be de-registered by SEPA if it is not managed properly and no longer fulfills the criteria requirements of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health. If the activity does comply with the exemption criteria the registration will not have to be renewed except where there is a significant change to the activity.\n\nQ. I will need to segregate wood and plastic from demolition and construction materials before I screen the material to produce an aggregate. Does the paragraph 13 exemption allow me to do this?\n\nA. No, the Paragraph 13 exemption would cover screening of this type of waste to produce an aggregate but not the pre-sorting of the material. As the pre-sorting is not covered by any exemption, this activity would need to be authorised by a waste management licence.\n\nQ. Do I need to register a Paragraph 13 exemption for screening activities if I have a crushing plant which is regulated by SEPA as a PPC Part B process?\n\nA. Yes, you do need to register the screening activity as a Paragraph 13 (2) as the PPC Permit would only cover the crushing activity but not any ancillary activities such as the storage of waste prior to crushing.\n\nGuidance\n\nWhere an exempt activity relates to the storage, treatment or recovery of waste then operating out with the parameters specified for that activity may indicate that a waste disposal activity is taking place.

For further information on SLfT, please visit the Revenue Scotland websiteor contact SEPA.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n25. —(1) The deposit of waste arising from dredging inland waters or public SUD systems, or from clearing plant matter from inland waters or public SUD systems, if either–\n\n(a) the waste is deposited along the bank or towpath of the waters, or on land adjacent to the public SUD system, where the dredging or clearing takes place; or\n\n(b) the waste is deposited along the bank or towpath of any inland waters, or on land adjacent to a public SUD system, so as to result in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement.\n\n(2) The total amount of waste deposited along the bank or towpath, or on land adjacent to the public SUD system, under sub paragraph (1) must not at any time exceed 50 tonnes for each metre of the bank, towpath or land along or on which it is deposited.\n\n(3) Sub paragraph (1) does not apply to waste deposited in a container or lagoon.\n\n(4) Sub paragraph (1)(a) only applies to the deposit of waste by an establishment or undertaking where the waste deposited is the establishment or undertaking's own waste.\n\n(5) The treatment by screening or dewatering of such waste as is mentioned in sub paragraph (1)–\n\n(a) on the bank or towpath of the waters, or on land adjacent to the public SUD system, where either the dredging or clearing takes place or the waste is to be deposited, prior to its being deposited in reliance upon the exemption conferred by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph;\n\n(b) on the bank or towpath of the waters, or on land adjacent to the public SUD system, where the dredging or clearing takes place, or at a place where the waste is to be spread, prior to its being spread in reliance upon the exemption conferred by paragraph 7(1) or (2); or\n\n(c) in the case of waste from dredging, on the bank or towpath of the waters, or on land adjacent to the public SUD system, where the dredging takes place, or at a place where the waste is to be spread, prior to its being spread in reliance upon the exemption conferred by paragraph 9(1).\n\n(6) In this paragraph, \"public SUD system\" has the same meaning as in section 59(1) of the Sewage (Scotland ) Act 1968.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited but it can be de-registered by SEPA if it is not managed properly and no longer fulfills the criteria requirements of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health. If the activity does comply with the exemption criteria the registration will not have to be renewed except where there is a significant change to the activity.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n29. —(1) The disposal of waste as specified in sub-paragraph (1A) at the place where it is produced, by the person producing it, by burning it in an incinerator. –\n\n(a) The specified disposal is the burning of biomass waste or animal carcasses to the extent that doing so is, or forms part of, an activity falling within paragraphs (a) or (b) of Part B of Section 5.1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2012 Regulations.\n\n(b) A disposal under sub-paragraph (1) must, where the activity is authorised under the 1991 Regulations, be in an exempt incinerator for the purposes of Section 5.1 (incineration) of Schedule 1 to those Regulations.\n\n(2) The secure storage at that place of any such waste intended to be submitted to such burning.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nGuidance:\n\nSEPA’s current position on the use of drum incinerators is as follows -\n\n1. Drum incinerators can still be used providing biomass waste or animal carcasses are burned.\n\n2. This exemption can no longer be used for burning plastics or other non biomass material.\n\n3. However, where agricultural waste is burned in a drum incinerator in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health an offence may be committed under section 33(1)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in contravention of the relevant objectives. SEPA will investigate such complaints.\n\n4. There is also potential for legal action by local authorities under The Clean Air Act 1993 if dark or black smoke is produced and under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 if there is statutory nuisance.\n\n5. Farm Quality Assurance schemes often discourage burning on farms\n\nThe Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 require that all organisations, businesses etc. have a duty to take all reasonable steps to recycle the 5 key waste streams (cardboard, paper, glass, plastic and metal). It is recognised that limited recycling services may be available in some areas, however where recycling services do exist the key waste streams should be recycled.\n\nFor these reasons, SEPA advises against the use of drum incinerators. Farmers should be advised to look into off-farm recovery and disposal routes (e.g. through local authority commercial collections).\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited but it can be de-registered by SEPA if it is not managed properly and no longer fulfills the criteria requirements of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health. If the activity does comply with the exemption criteria the registration will not have to be renewed except where there is a significant change to the activity.\n\nQ. What can you do?\n\nA. You can burn biomass or animal carcass waste generated by yourself in an exempt incinerator.\n\nQ. Who can do it?\n\nA. Anyone who wishes to burn waste that they have produced and who has registered a Paragraph 29 exemption.\n\nQ. Where can you do it?\n\nA. At the place or places which you identify when you register the exemption which must be the place where the waste was generated.\n\nQ. What is meant by an exempt incinerator?\n\nA. An incinerator is only exempt dependent on its capacity and the type of waste burned. Generally it is a plant that is incapable of burning at a rate which is greater than 50kg per hour. Specifically, it needs to be exempt under Section 5.1 (incineration) of Schedule 1 to the Pollution Prevention Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012. The types of wastes that can be burned by an exempt incinerator are stipulated in section 2.7 of the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) practical guide (see answer below).\n\nQ. Are you permitted to burn any type of waste?\n\nA. No, guidance on the types of wastes that can be burned by an exempt incinerator are given in section 2.7 of the Waste Waste Incineration Directive (WID) practical guide .\n\nExcluded plant may only burn the following:\n\nVegetable waste from agriculture and forestry\n\nVegetable waste from the food processing industry, if the heat generated is recovered.\n\nFibrous vegetable waste from pulp-making, if the heat generated is recovered.\n\nUncontaminated wood waste (but not paper or card).\n\nUncontaminated cork waste.\n\nWhere waste is burned in a drum incinerator in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health an offence may be committed under section 33(1)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in contravention of the relevant objectives.\n\nQ. Are you permitted to dispose of the resulting ash?\n\nA. No, the disposal of ash from a drum incinerator must be to a suitably licensed facility. As farm landfills require PPC landfill permits, on-site disposal is unlikely to be an option and off-site disposal will be required.\n\nQ. What can you do?\n\nA. You can store waste that you intend to burn under the terms of the Paragraph 29 (1). Q. Where can you store it? A. At the place where it is to be burned which must also be capable of preventing its escape and controlling public access.\n\nQ. What can I do with my recyclable waste?\n\nA.The Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 require all businesses (including farm businesses) to present metal, plastic, glass, paper and card for separate collection from 1 January 2014. It is recognised that limited recycling services may be available in some areas, however where recycling services do exist the key waste streams should be recycled. Your waste contractor should provide collection and treatment services which deliver high quality recycling such as separate bins for dry recyclable materials. More information is available on our Zero Waste Regulations page.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n30. —(1) Burning waste on land in the open if–\n\n(a) the waste consists of plant tissue;\n\n(b) it is agricultural waste or it is produced on land which is operational land of a railway, light railway, tramway, British Waterways, or which is a forest, woodland, park, garden, verge, landscaped area, sports ground, recreation ground, bank of an inland waterway, churchyard or cemetery, or it is produced on other land as a result of demolition work;\n\n(c) it is burned on the land where it is produced; and\n\n(d) the total quantity burned in any period of 24 hours does not exceed 10 tonnes.\n\n(2) Sub paragraph (1) only applies to the burning of waste by an establishment or undertaking where the waste burned is the establishment or undertaking's own waste.\n\n(3) The burning of waste consisting of plant tissue waste, in pursuance of a notice given under article 32 of the Plant Health (Scotland) Order 2005.\n\n(4) The total quantity of waste burned under sub-paragraph (3) in any period of 24 hours shall not exceed 10 tonnes.\n\n(5) The storage pending its burning, on the land where it is to be burned, of waste which is to be burned in reliance upon the exemption conferred by sub paragraph (1) or (3).\n\n(6) The treatment of land for the benefit of agriculture or ecological improvement by incorporation into soil of ash from waste which is burned on that land in reliance upon the exemption conferred by sub paragraph (1) or (3).\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish. This form should be sent to the Registrar at your local SEPA area office (addresses are given on the form)\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. How long will the registration last? Will it require renewal at any time?\n\nA. The registration of this exemption is not time limited but it can be de-registered by SEPA if it is not managed properly and no longer fulfills the criteria requirements of the exemption or if the activities cause pollution or harm to health. If the activity does comply with the exemption criteria the registration will not have to be renewed except where there is a significant change to the activity.\n\nQ. What can you do?\n\nA. You can burn in the open, up to 10 tonnes per day of plant tissue waste, provided the wastes are your own.\n\nQ. What is meant by plant tissue waste?\n\nA. Plant tissue waste is intended as a very broad description of all materials of plant origin such as wood and vegetation and may include engineered materials of this type provided they are untreated.\n\nQ. Who can do it?\n\nA. Any establishment or undertaking who registers a Paragraph 30 exemption.\n\nQ. Where can you burn it?\n\nA. At the place or places you identify when your register the exemption which must also be one of the land types listed and must also be the place where the waste was generated.\n\nQ. What types of waste can you burn?\n\nA. The exemption allows the burning of untreated wood, bark and plant matter provided it does not cause pollution or a nuisance. The exemption does not allow any other waste type to be burnt in the open. Paragraph 30 (3) NOTE: If the activity is carried out in a way likely to cause a nuisance or the activity involves burning in a designated Air Quality Management Area, this exemption will not cover the activity. If the Local Authority inform SEPA that a nuisance has been caused by the activity or that the exemption is in an Air Quality Management Area SEPA can remove the activity from the register.\n\nQ. What can you do?\n\nA. You can store waste that you intend to burn.\n\nQ. Where can I store it?\n\nA. Only at the place where it will be burnt.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n44. —(1) Heating iron, steel or any ferrous-alloy, non ferrous metal or non-ferrous metal alloy, in one or more furnaces or other appliances the primary combustion chambers of which have in aggregate a net rated thermal input of less than 0.2 megawatts, for the purpose of removing grease, oil or any other non-metallic contaminant.\n\n(2) Sub paragraph (1) does not apply to the removal by heat of plastic or rubber covering from scrap cable or of any asbestos contaminant.\n\n(3) In the case of a process involving the heating of iron, steel or any ferrous-alloy, sub paragraph (1) does not apply if that process is related to a process described in any of paragraphs (a) to (h), or (j) to (m), of Part A or paragraphs (a) to (c), or (e) or (f), of Part B of Section 2.1 of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Regulations or an activity described in Section 2.1 (other than in paragraph (d) of Part B) of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2000 Regulations.\n\n(4) In the case of a process involving the heating of any non-ferrous metal or non ferrous metal alloy, sub paragraph (1) does not apply if that process is related to a process described in any of paragraphs (a) to (g), or (i) to (k), of Part A of Section 2.2 of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Regulations or an activity described in Part A of Section 2.2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2000 Regulations.\n\n(5) The secure storage of waste intended to be submitted to heating to which sub paragraph (1) applies if the waste or, as the case may be, any container in which the waste is stored, is stored on an impermeable pavement which is provided with a sealed drainage system.\n\n(6) In this paragraph, \"net rated thermal input\" means the rate at which fuel can be burned at the maximum continuous rating of the appliance multiplied by the net calorific value of the fuel and expressed as megawatts thermal.\n\n(7) In this paragraph, \"ferrous alloy\" means an alloy of which iron is the largest constituent, or equal to the largest constituent, by weight, whether or not that alloy also has a non ferrous metal content greater than any percentage specified in Section 2.2 of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Regulations, and \"non-ferrous metal alloy\" shall be construed accordingly.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nNeeds to be registered with SEPA but no fee is required.\n\nThis exemption can be registered online.\n\nHowever, establishments and undertakings can still use the paper form should they wish.

SEPA must notify the establishment before the renewal date. A renewal form, new plan and fee must be submitted every year for the exemption to remain valid.\n\nIf the renewal is not received within 2 months of the renewal date, the registration can be cancelled and removed from the register.\n\nNotification form:\n\nUse WMX-FM45 - Form to register or renew a paragraph 45 exemption (137kb)\n\nFor Paragraph 45 renewals, please also fill out:\n\n- Annual Return Form for Exempt Activities (Word) (193kb) or\n\n- Annual Return Form for Exempt Activities (PDF) (173kb)\n\nGuidance:\n\nTechnical Guidance for Paragraph 45 is provided at the end of the registration form.\n\nThe following questions and answers are provided to help you further understand this exemption:\n\nQ. Paragraph 45 (1) allows motor vehicles to be dismantled, rebuilt, restored and reconditioned but only if they are depolluted. What does this mean?\n\nA. Scrap motor vehicles can only be recovered under this exemption in the ways described if have been depolluted by removal of the following fluids and components – batteries, LPG tanks, airbags/seats, belt pre-tentioners, mercury containing components and 98% of each drained fluid. The depollution of scrap motor vehicles can only be permitted by the holder and operator of an ELV (End of Life Vehicle) waste management licence.\n\nQ. How are sites reminded that their renewal is due?\n\nA. SEPA send out a notice telling operators that their registration is due for renewal at least one month before it is due to expire. SEPA will also enclose a renewal form.\n\nQ. What happens if the operator forgets to renew the registration after twelve months?\n\nA. If an operator has not renewed their registration within 2 months of the expiry date of the previous registration, the activity will be removed from the public register. Operators, who continue to operate whilst the activity is unregistered, will be operating illegally and may be subject to enforcement action.\n\nQ. Does this exemption only apply to metals from end of life vehicles?\n\nA. No - see WST-PS-041. SEPA recognises that similar metals arise from many other waste streams such as industrial pipework or ducting or metals from offshore oil and gas activities, e.g. structural metals, jackets, staircases etc. and that these can be handled in a similar way to the waste metals arising from ELVs without additional risk to the environment. The effect of the position statement is to remove the restriction to wastes within the EWC category 16 01 17 and 16 01 18, and also allow the treatment of depolluted offshore oil and gas equipment. You can also store (but not treat, e.g. break open) catalytic converters.\n\nWhat the legislation says:\n\n47. —(1) The repair or refurbishment or both at a secure place of WEEE as described in column 1 of Table 18, together with any incidental storage and other incidental activities in relation to that type of WEEE if–\n\n(a) the activity is carried on with a view to the reuse of the WEEE for its original purpose;\n\n(b) best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques are used when carrying out the activity;\n\n(c) in respect of a description of waste contained in column 1 of Table 18, the total quantity of WEEE so dealt with at that place does not exceed either the storage limit specified in column 2 of that Table or the treatment limit specified in column 3 in relation to that type of WEEE;\n\n(d) the technical requirements specified in Annex III of the WEEE Directive are met;\n\n(e) prior to the treatment of WEEE and in relation to any waste components from WEEE, such WEEE or components are stored in such a manner that their environmentally sound reuse or recycling is not hindered; and\n\n(f) no WEEE is stored at that place for longer than 12 months.\n\nTable 18\n\nCodes and type of waste* Storage limits** Treatment limits 16 02 14 (WEEE other than those mentioned in 16 02 09 to 16 02 13) 50 cubic metres 2 tonnes/day 20 01 36 (WEEE other than those mentioned in 20 01 21 and 20 01 23 and 20 01 35) 50 cubic metres 2 tonnes/day\n\n* Codes referred to in the European Waste Catalogue.\n\n** In total either awaiting repair or refurbishment or stored following such treatment.\n\n(2) The carrying on, at any secure place in respect of WEEE that is special waste as described in Table 19, the treatment activities of repair or refurbishment or both together with any incidental storage and other incidental activities, but not including the degassing and capture of ozone depleting substances in relation to that type of WEEE if–\n\n(a) the activity is carried on primarily with a view to the reuse of the WEEE for its original purpose;\n\n(b) best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques are used when carrying out the activity;\n\n(c) in respect of a description of waste contained in a particular row to Table 19 the total quantity of WEEE so dealt with at that place does not exceed either the storage limit specified in column 2, or the treatment limit specified in column 3 of that Table for the types of WEEE in that row;\n\n(d) the technical requirements specified in Annex III of the WEEE Directive are met;\n\n(e) the other requirements specified in column 4 of that Table for that type of WEEE are met;\n\n(f) prior to the treatment of WEEE and in relation to any waste components from WEEE, such WEEE or components are stored in such a manner that their environmentally sound reuse or recycling is not hindered; and\n\n(g) no WEEE is stored at that place for longer than 12 months.\n\nTable 19\n\nCodes and type of waste* Storage limits** Treatment limits Other requirements\n\n16 02 11 (WEEE containing chlorofluorocarbons, HCFC or HFC) and 20 01 23 (WEEE containing chlorofluorocarbons) 80 cubic metres 5 tonnes/day Stored in a manner that will prevent the release of the CFCs, HCFCs or HFCs Televisions and computer monitors containing cathode ray tubes falling within 16 02 13 (WEEE containing hazardous components other than those mentioned in 16 02 09 to 16 02 12) and 20 01 35 (WEEE other than those mentioned in 20 01 21 and 20 01 23 containing hazardous components) 80 cubic metres 5 tonnes/day\n\n* Codes referred to in the European Waste Catalogue.\n\n** In total either awaiting repair or refurbishment or stored following such treatment.\n\n(3) Sub paragraphs (1) or (2) only apply to the carrying out of an activity at a place if the person responsible for the management of that place has established administrative arrangements to ensure that–\n\n(a) WEEE accepted at that place is of a type set out in column 1 of Table 18 or 19, as the case may be; and\n\n(b) no waste is accepted at that place in such a quantity as would cause there to be a breach of any of the terms and conditions of the exemption.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, the storage and treatment limits set out in columns 2 and 3 of Tables 18 and 19 are overall limits that apply to all waste falling within the 6 digit code or codes specified in column 1 of those Tables.\n\nRegistration requirements:\n\nMust be notified to SEPA using the appropriate form and enclosing the correct fee.
