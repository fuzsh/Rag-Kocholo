        "text": "There is indeed a general tendency in Scotland as in the rest of Western Europe, that many people's lifestyles, values and self-identity changed as society around them changed, which lead to spending less time with friends and family, a reduction of the length of marriages, and falling church attendance (just to show some other examples that it's not only church attendance alone which changed). Just as other answers provided, the population has become slightly more secular in recent decades, in the entire Western world. However, this is not all of the reason, and the sharp reduction in membership of the \"mainline\" or \"national\" churches can not be explained away in its entirety by this, as that reduction is much bigger than the overall change in religiousness. For example, some other Christian denominations increased in membership. This must mean that many who left the Church of Scotland did not leave Christianity, they just switched over to a different denomination.\n\nThis is part of the general tendency when churches become theologically more liberal. Conservative members leave to join other, more conservative denominations, which makes the church on average more theologically liberal. Leadership then makes the church even more \"progressive\", to make it more palatable to liberals, but instead of new liberals joining, conservatives start to leave because the church has become too liberal for them. This fuels a feedback loop, in which (from the viewpoint of theologically conservative members) the leadership takes Christ out of the church to make it more worldly and more palatable for lukewarm members, then the leadership sees the dropping numbers, and takes Christ even more out of the church to be less \"offensive\", they even adopt doctrines completely contrary to the Bible, in order to be less \"offensive\", but all this results in is more and more of the serious believers leaving, until the church becomes merely a social activist and self-help group. But as such groups can be found everywhere else, now the less serious believers who only came for the community and the nice self-help messages, also leave for other secular groups offering nearly the same services. There is a quote attributed to David F. Wells: \"If the Church becomes like the world, why would the world need the Church?\"\n\nSome examples of this \"liberalization\" go as far as some churches in Canada where the pastor is openly atheist. The Church of Scotland is not such an extreme example, but they have become significantly more theologically liberal in recent years, for example they now accept openly gay (while non-celibate) people as clergy, and perform gay marriages. This (among other \"modernizations\") is seen by theologically conservative members as unbiblical, who then leave for more conservative denominations. This also explains why the decline in membership in the Catholic Church is much less severe.\n\n(Under liberal and conservative I mean theologically liberal or conservative, not necessarily politically, although they overlap to some extent.)\n\nSeparately from the government-run censuses (2001, 2011, 2022) there have been privately run church censuses in Scotland asking for figures direct from churches. The last one was 2016.\n\nThis looks at actual church attendance and may be worth looking at\n\nThe number of people who identified on the government census as Church of Scotland in 2001 was approximately ten times the number of actual worshippers. So the great majority of Church of Scotland people did not attend. Why, then, did they say they were C of S? In many cases this was seen as the default response, particularly from the older generations. Most Scottish people regarded themselves as Church of Scotland who had perhaps no real interest in Christianity. The Church of Scotland, as the national church, was regarded as the default religion to be. It was patriotic to be Church of Scotland, the Queen's Kirk, and many Scots were somewhat proud it was better than the C of E or the RCC, though most would be hard-pressed to say exactly how. To the older generation, everyone had a religion, whether or not they practiced it or believed it in any way.\n\nAs that feeling has faded, people who do not, as a matter of fact, practice a religion, no longer feel they want to claim that they are C of S (or over the border C of E) or even in the RoI that they are RCC. The sense of identity, quite apart from practice or belief, has diminished.\n\nA major part of the difference is older, more religious people dying. As @Servaes point out up to a third of Scots living in 2001 are now dead.\n\nThe case of the Roman Catholic Church is interesting. In terms of attendance the RCC and the CofS are more or less similar and have been since 2001. But those identifying as Roman Catholic have held up better.\n\nOne reason is migration and population churning. Many immigrants from Europe are Roman Catholic and, whether they attend in Scotland or not, remember that they are Catholic. Nobody, or virtually nobody, who moves to Scotland is already a member of the Church of Scotland because, for example, there aren't CofS churches in Poland. Minority Ethnic are up from 4.5% in 2001 to 12.9% in 2022.\n\nPerhaps there is something of a brand recognition effect which may boulster the RCC figures. If one is culturally a Catholic, in the sense that one supports Celtic, then it is easy to tick Roman Catholic on the form. If one supports Rangers, or one's father played in an Orange flute band, one does not find the word Protestant on the form so may not think to put C of S.\n\nAnd of course there are also people switching denominations for religious reasons, but these are a relatively minor effect statistically since the majority of those who say they have a religion are non-practicing.\n\nFURTHER THOUGHTS\n\nSince the Acts of Union 1707 bound Scotland and England together, Scotland's sense of nationhood was heavily bound in with the separate status of her national church. People outwith the British Isles, and many within them, fail to understand the extent to which Scots regarded Scotland as a distinct (not separate but distinct) nation within the United Kingdom (and indeed the British Empire), long before political devolution and independence was mooted. In the 1638 Covenant the representatives of Scotland declared themselves very firmly for the Presbyterian form of governance. This was restored by King William (of Orange) in 1690 and inviolably secured in 1707. Since 1707 Scotland was dominated by England as the much larger population, but when it came to religion it had its own.\n\nHere in Scotland, I was told as a small boy, Christ alone is Head of the Church. Not the Pope, nor even the Queen (an ordinary member and a deeply respected one nevertheless), but in Scotland Christ Himself was Head of the Kirk. Not having bishops was something to be proud of. It was democratic.\n\nScotland's sense of nationhood is no longer bound in, as it once was, with Presbyterianism.There has been devolution meaning Scotland now has other means of asserting nationhood.\n\nLess than 48 hours after the death of our lately beloved Queen Elizabeth our new King swore this solemn oath, before his proclamation:\n\nI, Charles the Third, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of My other Realms and Territories, King, Defender of the Faith, do faithfully promise and swear that I shall inviolably maintain and preserve the Settlement of the true Protestant Religion as established by the Laws made in Scotland in prosecution of the Claim of Right and particularly by an Act intituled “An Act for securing the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government” and by the Acts passed in the Parliament of both Kingdoms for Union of the two Kingdoms, together with the Government, Worship, Discipline, Rights and Privileges of the Church of Scotland.\n\nHis late Mother swore a similar oath in 1952 shortly after the death of her Father, King George VI, as have all monarchs since 1707.\n\nYet those Scots alive and aware in 1952 (we might say born post-War) heard in those words a solemn recognition and acceptance of Scotland as a distinct country with its own Church that could never be violated by any Earthly sovereign. Scotland's sense of nationhood, and the Church of Scotland, were tied in together in a way perhaps difficult to imagine now.\n\nIn a modern, increasingly diverse and cosmopolitan Scotland, in which Christianity of any kind is less significant to many, and which is confident of its nationhood (having considered independence and rejected it but conscious it may happen one day if that's what people want); our new King's oath has much less resonance and many saw it as not terribly relevant to the present. It did not so much defend Scotland against the world, as a particular Sctottish denomination against other Scots.\n\nSo I suggest as one reason for the decline in those identifying as CofS is the fact that it has ceased to be so inextricably bound with Scottish identity."
