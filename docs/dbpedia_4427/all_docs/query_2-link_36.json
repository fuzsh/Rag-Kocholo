        "text": "Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. The definition of an SME is important for access to finance and EU support programmes targeted specifically at these enterprises.\n\nWhat is an SME?\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are defined in the EU recommendation 2003/361.\n\nThe main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME are\n\nstaff headcount\n\neither turnover or balance sheet total\n\nThese ceilings apply to the figures for individual firms only. A firm that is part of a larger group may need to include staff headcount/turnover/balance sheet data from that group too.\n\nFurther details include\n\nThe revised user guide to the SME definition (2020) (2 MB, available in all EU languages)\n\nDeclaring your enterprise to be an SME (the form is available in all languages as an annex in the revised user guide)\n\nThe SME self-assessment tool which you can use to determine whether your organisation qualifies as a small and medium-sized enterprise\n\nWhat help can SMEs get?\n\nThere are 2 broad types of potential benefit for an enterprise if it meets the criteria\n\neligibility for support under many EU business-support programmes targeted specifically at SMEs: research funding, competitiveness and innovation funding and similar national support programmes that could otherwise be banned as unfair government support ('state aid' â€“ see block exemption regulation)\n\nfewer requirements or reduced fees for EU administrative compliance\n\nMonitoring of the implementation of the SME definition\n\nThe Commission monitors the implementation of the SME definition and reviews it in irregular intervals. Pursuant to the latest evaluation, the Commission concluded that there is no need for a revision.\n\nOn 25 October 2021, we informed stakeholders by holding a webinar with presentations on the SME evaluation's results and next steps.\n\nSupporting documents"
