        "text": "Most Episcopal churches have just one name. But The Church of St. Michael & St. George is special because it has two names, and has ever since 1928 when St. George’s Episcopal Church in St. Louis joined with The Church of St. Michael and All Angels in Clayton to establish The Church of St. Michael & St. George as we know it on today’s current site.\n\nSt. George’s Episcopal Church in the City of St. Louis dates back to 1845. St. George’s Church had three locations as it followed the westward movement of the city’s population. The Church of St. Michael and All Angels was organized in 1913 and located on the edge of the 1904 World’s Fair fairgrounds, just west of what is now Forest Park. The merger of the two parishes to create The Church of St. Michael & St. George occurred in 1928. We’ve been going strong ever since.\n\nA History of St. Michael & St. George"
