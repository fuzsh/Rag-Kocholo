        "text": "Most people think Cairo only in terms of the Pyramids and the Nile river. You might be surprised to know that there a lot of religious history there which includes (Coptic) Christian and Jewish history too. In fact, Jesus sheltered in Cairo at the site of the Saint Sergius and Bacchus Church with his family as a child, and there are some of the first Christian Coptic churches in Cairo (and in fact the world). It is also home to several ancient Jewish temples. Of course, there are many breathtaking and interesting Islamic Mosques that are must visits as well.\n\nMom and I spent the day with our wonderful tour guide Doaa from Egypt Travel. What impressed me most about this day was her depth of knowledge about every single place we visited especially the Christian and Jewish history. It made our tour that much more interesting. Even though I had visited the area before, I got to see far more with her expert guidance.\n\nWe started off our tour on this day in the area known as “Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo” which is a walled city area encompassing The Hanging Church, The Babylon Fortress, The Coptic Museum, Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, The Greek Church of St. George, and Ben Ezra Synagogue.\n\nThe Hanging Church\n\nI had visited The Hanging Church before and it was one of the things I was most anxious for my mother to experience while we were in Cairo. Even if you aren’t a religious person, one can’t help but be absolutely fascinated by the history, the architecture, and its significance.\n\nEvery single thing in the hanging church has significance and iconology built into it. For example, if you look at the photo below, you can see columns running along the sides of the church. There are thirteen columns for Jesus and his disciples: nine of them are the plain creamy alabaster color, two of them are grey (Thomas and Peter), one of them is black (Judas) and one of them is white (Jesus). Looking at the top picture you can see up close the detail of the back wall panels shown in the bottom photo. They are slotted together like puzzle pieces yet are solid and strong. There is such intricate workmanship throughout. The symbol of the fish and the cross are used over and over again in all of the designs.\n\nIt is called “The Hanging Church” because of its very special architecture which allows the churches foundation to be suspended over the ruins of a Roman fortress. The pulpit slides back and forth over a hidden staircase for concealed escape.\n\nI could write an entire post about this amazing church, but I wouldn’t have time to talk about all of the rest of the things we saw. If you are interested in learning more about the places we visited in this area, visit: Coptic Cairo.\n\nSaint Georges Church\n\nThe next big impressive church we visited in this area is St. George Greek Orthodox Church. It’s very interesting to see this massive church which stands boldly amongst the others in the area. It was built on top of the ruins of the Fortress of Babylon and echoes its round shape. It is still in use today and we got to see the beginnings of a service.\n\nSaint Sergius and Bacchus Church\n\nThe Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church was a tour that took us into the underground caverns or cellar area where the Holy Family lived in their time in Cairo. Apparently, it used to be flooded but has now been pumped out so you can go and see. It gave me chills being there. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to hide in these dark cellars with a child.\n\nBen Ezra Synagogue\n\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue was interesting as it started its life out as a Christian church. It was sold and converted to a Synagogue to pay back taxes that had been owed. Sadly, it is no longer in use as a synagogue, only a tourist attraction. An interesting note about this synagogue is that it is said to be on the site that the baby Moses was found.\n\nIn between all of the churches are little tourist shops and bookstores. Most of the trinkets seemed covered in dust and dirt in the little passages but it was fascinating to see all of them there. There was a gallery of old photographs of the area too, but alas I didn’t get a picture of that.\n\n*Note: much of this tour was up and down stairs, uneven pavements, and going through dark and narrow passages. It’s a good thing to keep in mind when you are visiting. Also, the bathroom areas are BASIC so you may want to make sure you go before you start your tour. My mother got tired after each church so we had to stop and take a breath between each visit. Cars are not allowed in the walled city so this is all walking.\n\nMohammed Ali Mosque\n\nWe then moved on to the Mohammed Ali Mosque (also known as the Alabaster Mosque) which is located in the Saladin Citadel that sits high above Cairo, looking down on the city sprawling below it. This area was a former fortress and there are huge defensive walls surrounding the entire structure. It is such a tourist area these days that they are building shops and restaurants inside the walls along with seating areas so that tourists can linger and enjoy the amazing views and history of the place.\n\nThe interior of the Mohammed Ali mosque is completely made out of Alabaster which has been carved and polished. There are handmade carpets on the floor in the center, but each worshiper gets a personal prayer rug to kneel and pray on. Women pray in a separate space above the main floor.\n\nIt has huge decorated domes on the inside that lead the eye to heaven and you can’t help but marvel at the beauty. The wide-open corridors and intricate carvings on all of the walls and doors are just awesome. The open courtyard has a gazebo type structure that worshippers use to complete their ritual washing of the hands and feet before prayer.\n\n*Note: This part of the trip was walking uphill a lot. You also need to remember that women are asked to wear a headscarf and be modestly dressed when visiting any Mosque. Please don’t be “That person” that totally disrespects their culture and religious beliefs. You are also asked to remove your shoes before you enter any mosque. There are attendants who are happy to keep your shoes safe while you tour the gorgeous buildings. This post just touches on some of the amazing religious historical places to see in Cairo. For me, this was one of the highlights of my trip to Egypt. Our final post will include Islamic Cairo which takes us to even more amazing historic mosques and through the Khan El Khalili Market."
