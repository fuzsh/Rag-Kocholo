        "text": "The history of St Georgeâs church, particularly in its beginnings, has been inextricably linked with the social and economic history of Douglas and the Isle of Man, as well as the Islandâs association with Britain.\n\nEarly in the eighteenth century the Bishop of Sodor and Man, Thomas Wilson, was greatly concerned that Douglas had no church. In 1708 he was instrumental in having St Matthewâs built in the marketplace alongside the quay in what was then the main population and trading area of the town. Wilson, who strongly condemned the smuggling and running trade in the Isle of Man, did not foresee the prosperity that this âtradeâ would bring and the increase and spread it would cause to the population, then about 800, of the Islandâs largest town.\n\nBy 1761 Bishop Wilsonâs successor, Mark Hildesley, realised that St Matthewâs was becoming woefully inadequate for the town whose population had now increased to approximately 2,000. He preached an earnest sermon in favour of church extension in Douglas. At the same time, the gentry and the merchants of the prospering town â a result of the âtradeâ â had ambitions. They were finding St Matthewâs crowded and unsuitable for their spiritual and social needs. On 26 October 1761 Philip Moore, Hugh Cosnahan, William Quayle, Peter John Heywood, John Christian, James Oates, Richard Joynes, John Joseph Bacon, John Finch, John Clarke, Robert Black and Robert Caesar requested an interview with Bishop Hildesley to discuss the need for âa more commodious place for the public worship of God in this townâ. These gentlemen proposed that St Matthewâs should be dissolved by an Act of Tynwald to enable the Bishop to âmake sale or otherwise dispose of the same and the site thereof to defray the expenses attending the erectionâ of a new chapel. They proposed that the stipend for the chaplain of St Matthewâs and the emolument for his position as master of the Douglas Day School should be transferred to the new chapel. They also proposed that the owners of pews in the old chapel, on transfer, should receive equal accommodation in the new. They further proposed that a burial yard should be purchased. As a result of this meeting, plans for the new chapel went ahead, but not at the demise of St Matthewâs; it survived.\n\nA prime site, at Oates Land on the hills to the north of the growing town and reached by a rough road, was given as a gift by Philip Moore of the Hills estate. Many people had undertaken to subscribe to the erection of the new chapel, and by the end of 1761 the list of promises totalled Â£712. Additionally, firm monetary donations had been âmade by sundry well disposâd personsâ. The Bishop had appointed trustees to raise further subscriptions. One of these trustees was Dr Richard Betham, the Crownâs customs officer in the Isle of Man who later became the father-in-law of Captain William Bligh of the âBountyâ fame. On the strength of all this support, work began on the new chapel-of-ease which would ecclesiastically belong to the parish of Kirk Braddan.\n\nThe trustees were entirely responsible for the construction of the chapel, ordering timber, stones and other items, employing workmen, receiving progress reports, gathering in money and making arrangements to ensure strict economy. An overseer was employed to superintend the work. Whilst no architectâs plans of the chapel are known to exist, it seems that the design was possibly based on St Jamesâ in Whitehaven of which the overseer had been instructed to make a copy drawing. Building stone was hauled in carts from Bankâs Howe on the northern outskirts of Douglas and the Nunnery Howe on the nearby southern hills of the town. Limestone was burnt in a kiln situated in the chapel grounds. A schooner was chartered to bring timber to the Island from Riga in Latvia. Construction work went on for the next four years, with the roof and part of the internal timber work finished. At this stage all the money collected had been spent.\n\nThen in 1765 came disaster. The Isle of Man, with its low customs duties, was ideally centred in the Irish Sea for use as a base for legitimately receiving goods in large ships and dispatching them in smaller ones, to be then smuggled into neighbouring secluded British harbours. The Island believed itself to be outside the jurisdiction of Britain. But it became obvious that the British Government would have to take some drastic action against this âtradeâ which was so adversely affecting the Imperial coffers. It made a proposal to John Murray, third Duke of Atholl and feudal lord of the Isle of Man, âfor the Purchase of the Isle of Man, preventing that pernicious and illicit Trade which is at present carried on to the great diminution and detriment of the Revenues of this Kingdomâ. The Revestment Act of 10 May 1765 returned the sovereignty of the Isle of Man to the British Crown, importantly together with control of the customs duties. The Act dealt a blow not only to smuggling but to legitimate trade in general. The merchants of Douglas were devastated. âThe sale of the Island,â wrote one of the chapel trustees, âwhich put a period to our opulence, put a period to everything that depended upon it.â Concern about their businesses resulted in many of the people who had pledged financial support for the new chapel to withdraw their offers. The building work was brought to a stop with outstanding debts. The Island suffered directly after Revestment. Few legal importations were made, smugglingÂ intoÂ the Island became prevalent, the trading towns became almost deserted, the rents of houses and lands fell to one-third of their former value, and very many of the Manx people were obliged to leave the Island to âseek their bread in foreign landsâ.t was Bishop Richard Richmond who revived the chapel project ten years later in 1775. He appointed new trustees to again open subscription and donation lists to compound the old debts and finance the new work. The appeal was even successfully extended to Britain where Â£418 1s 0d was received from numerous wealthy persons, including three archbishops, thirteen bishops, the Duke and Duchess of Atholl, six other dukes, six earls and others of the nobility and gentry. All this success meant that the work could be resumed in 1776 with a more extensive scheme proposed.\n\nDuring its construction the chapel was presented with a silver communion service marked âDouglasâs New Chapel 1777â. Tradition has it that its donor was John Murray, fourth Duke of Atholl. The service consists of two chalices, one large paten, two small patens, a flagon and a spoon, and is engraved with the sacred initials âI H Sâ, the cross and three nails set in a halo. Before the chapel could be finished a fresh calamity occurred. Bishop Richmond died in 1780. His estate was insolvent, and the money collected for the chapel could not be distinguished from his private finances. The unfortunate trustees had already given money to the Bishop on personal bonds. As the building was almost completed, they were now committed too far to stop. They agreed to pay any accounts themselves, though, not unnaturally, they thought âit just and reasonable that we shouâd charge interest until we shall be reimbursedâ.\n\nAccounts rendered in the latter stages of the construction reveal some interesting facts. Deal boards cost 1s (5p) each, nails 10d (4p) and 2s per hundred, sprigs 4d per hundred, brass curtain rings 3d per dozen, stock locks 2s each, a hand lock 9d, white and yellow paint 6d per lb., linseed oil 6d per pint, turpentine 10d per pint, a paint brush and pot 8d, a large sweeping brush and stall 1s 10d, crimson duffoil 10s per yard, long lawn 2s 10d per yard, dark green cloth 6s 6d per yard, a tablecloth 7s 9d, tape 1/2d and 1d per yard and fine large-post paper 1s 6d per quire. The wages of carpenters were 1s 6d per day and cartage for the use of a horse was 5s per day. John Ware & Son were paid 6s 8d for advertising the seats. John Ware was the printer who published some parts of the Manx Bible and the Manx Hymns.\n\nThe chapel was finally completed on 24 November 1780. The size of the chapel, big enough to seat 1,300, was more impressive than its architecture. There was a single roof, the marks of which can still be seen in the tower. A semicircular apse at the east end contained the chancel, with an âearâ in which the chaplainâs family sat. At the west end it had a dominant plain square tower with little ornamentation. However, the interior was well made and had correctly proportioned fluted wood columns, lead Ionic capitals, Renaissance cornices and woodwork.\n\nThe congregation was to be drawn largely from the wealthy classes of Douglas. Early seating plans reveal that the pews were mostly purchased for twenty years or auctioned on a seven-year lease. This income was crucial in continuing to clear debts and finance the building of the chapel. Only some thirty seats were reserved free for the poor; most of the poorer worshippers of Douglas were to be left at St Matthewâs. Later plans show that pews were reserved for the Lord Bishop, the Duke of Atholl, the Governor-in-Chief, the Lieutenant Governor and members of the military serving at the Douglas fort and stationed in nearby barracks (hence the nearby Fort Street and Barrack Street).\n\nThe new chapel, now called St Georgeâs, was consecrated by the new Bishop, George Mason, on 29 September 1781. It has been suggested that the choice of patron saint may have been a compliment to the Bishop. The consecration ceremony was followed by a meal for distinguished guests. The bill for the proceedings included 21 bottles of red port wine: two guineas (10p each bottle); 19 dinners: Â£1 8s 6d in all (8p each person); and porter and ale: 9s. On the same day as the consecration, the first baptism in the chapel took place, that of John, son of Thomas and Isabel Cannell.\n\nThe Bishop had appointed the first chaplain of St Georgeâs, the Rev Charles Crebbin, who was also vicar of Santon. The Bishop reserved to himself this right, but it was challenged by the vicar of Braddan, the Rev Thomas Woods. Woods considered that, as St Georgeâs ecclesiastically belonged to the parish of Kirk Braddan, he should make the appointment and had consequently nominated his nephew the Rev Julius Cosnahan. The matter was referred to the Metropolitan Court of York. But the lengthy suit was never completed due to the death of both the Bishop and the vicar of Braddan.\n\nInterestingly, the first marriage at St Georgeâs was that of the Rev Crebbin to Miss Jane Callow on 25 October 1786. The Rev Crebbinâs original annual stipend was Â£80. Later records show that the chaplain received Â£100 per annum, the organist Â£15, the clerk Â£10 and the sexton Â£5.\n\nSt Georgeâs was closed for a time during 1828 whilst certain internal improvements were carried out. These included work on the galleries and a new vestry, as well as a new altar place, Bishopâs throne, pulpit and reading desk.\n\nIn 1844, with Douglasâ population having mushroomed to about 9,000, various options for structural alterations to enlarge St Georgeâs were considered but not acted upon. They included the possible construction of wings to the existing galleries and the erection of a gallery at the west end of the church which would have been reached by an exterior staircase. These various proposals were âprincipally for the accommodation of the poorâ. By 1847 a rearrangement of the interior layout of the chapel gave nearly 200 extra seats for the poor. However benevolent the proposed and actual improvements were intended to be, the class segregation system continued to be very prevalent.\n\nIt was not until 1864, with the population of Douglas now further increased to approximately 13,000, that any major structural alterations were processed. The old semicircular apse was pulled down and the church extended eastwards to contain a chancel, a reredos, vestries and organ chambers. The only stained glass in the church up until this date â two large windows given in 1852 by the High Bailiff and Vicar General, Samuel Harris, in memory of his father who had been a trustee â wereÂ reset in the new chancel. In 1865 a large central window was presented by Henry Bloom Noble, Douglasâ greatest benefactor. The white Caen stonework of the reredos was by Charles Swinnerton and the tablets were decorated by JohnÂ Nicholson; both men were from Douglas. A new font was provided in 1872 by Miss Moore; the original font was deposited with the Manx Museum some years later.\n\nWhen in 1863 Governor Henry Loch had taken up his appointment in the Isle of Man on behalf of the Lord of Man (the British Crown), he was immediately determined that the Island should equip itself for the recently established tourist industry which was replacing low customs duties as the main source of fiscal income. One of his immediate efforts was directed towards the provision of deep-water landing facilities for steamers at Douglas through the replacement of the breakwater and the construction of Victoria Pier. The new harbour at Douglas made it the principal port of the Isle of Man, so much so that in 1869 it became the Islandâs new capital, taking over from Castletown. The redesign of lower Douglas was a major priority for Loch. He inaugurated the building of Loch Promenade on land reclaimed from the foreshore. Over the next few years terraces of hotels were erected, with the sale of the plots paying for the construction of the promenade. Associated with the promenade work, the construction of Victoria Street provided a link between old Douglas and its new uptown suburbs. This new main thoroughfare, leading from Loch Promenade and connecting with Prospect Hill, passed close to St Georgeâs church which was now in the centre of a busy commercial and residential Douglas. Here, private residences such as those in Mona Street and Albert Street were being converted into holiday accommodation, thereby considerably increasing the churchâs summer congregations.\n\nThe recognition of the importance of Douglas was reflected on St Georgeâs, which became a parish andÂ achieved church status on 28 January 1878. In 1880 a considerable sum of money was collected for repairs and redecoration of the church. The chancel was richly ornamented with pilasters, the aisles and chancel were tiled, gas fittings were installed (the remains of which still exist), new stone window frames replaced the rotten wooden ones and three of the side aisle windows had stained glass installed. St Georgeâs became the temporary pro-cathedral of the diocese of Sodor and ManÂ in 1882. All diocesan and national services were held there, including enthronements of the Lord Bishops.\n\nIn 1892, due to the difficulty experienced in accommodating the large congregations which were swelled by holidaymakers, the Rev Robert Baron began holding the Sunday morning service outside in the churchyard during the summer months.\n\nAt a diocesan conference in 1897 it was decided that a new church was needed to serve the population of the new upper part of Douglas. All Saints, on Alexander Drive, was built as a curacy to St Georgeâs and was opened in 1898. Difficulties regarding freehold prevented a permanent church being consecrated but did not prevent the licensing of a temporary church. All Saints âtemporaryâ church would eventually be replaced by a new permanent church in 1967.\n\nAn extensive scheme of renovation for St Georgeâs had been decided upon in 1896. Â£1,500 was raised at a very grand and profitable bazaar held at the Palace on Douglas promenade the following year. But it was not until 1908, prompted by Bishop Thomas Drury, that the matter of renovation was taken up in earnest with further money raising schemes in place. It appears that Bishop Drury was planning that St Georgeâs would becomeÂ the cathedral church of the diocese. Considerable extensions and improvements were made during 1909-10 when the church was closed for several months. It was extended again at the east end to contain a new narrower chancel constructed four feet off the ground to carry the extension over existing graves. It was re-roofed with separate roofs for the nave and the two galleries. Additional vestries were provided. Stalls were built for the Bishop, the Archdeacon and the four canons. The cost of renovation was Â£6,413. The architects and builders were James Cowle & Sons. At this time a new pulpit, in the form of a cross, was given in memory of Captain William Kermode, one time Commodore of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The church was reopened on 5 May 1910 when Bishop Drury dedicated it in the presence of Archbishop Lang of York. The population of Douglas was now approximately 21,000.\n\nThe various menâs clubs associated with the church had played football in the late 1800s, but it was not until 1919 that St Georgeâs Association Football Club was founded. During its early years the clubâs famous battle cry of âFine day and the vicar out!â centred around the Rev William Charles Jordan, an amateur England international who played for West Bromwich Albion.\n\nThe present church hall at the end of Hill Street was built as a community centre and Sunday School and was completed in 1934.\n\nThe movement of population further away from the lower Douglas area caused a decline in the support of St Barnabasâ in Fort Street, so the church was closed in 1957, and the union of the benefices and parishes of St Georgeâs and St Barnabasâ occurred.\n\nIn 1969 the whole church interior was redecorated. Dykes Bower, Church Architect for Westminster Abbey, was invited to suggest the best scheme. He recommended reverting as far as possible to the original Georgian style of decoration. The walls, the pillars and the old pitch pine organ screen at the rear of the church were painted off-white with the slabs and flutings picked out in gold leaf.\n\nFor all but its recent history, the churchâs main source of income was raised by worshippers and supporters paying pew rents. By the late 1930s this income was about Â£150 annually, in the 1960s it stood at about Â£75, and was finally ended in 1982.\n\nThe original consecration order of 1781 expressly condemned and prohibited the practice of burying within the chapel building. A burial area within the churchyard was, therefore, an early part of the scheme. But the churchyard remained unenclosed for many years, no legal title to the land having been established. In 1809 John Moore â who had married into the Moores of the Hills family, the original owners of the site â granted title to the land in exchange for two seats in the chapel and a family plot in the churchyard. The churchyard was to be enclosed by a wall no less than five feet high.\n\nSt Georgeâs churchyard was essentially the âfield of the strangerâ. Most Manx people who died in Douglas had a right to burial in the parishes of Braddan or Onchan. There are, of course, many Manx interments in St Georgeâs, but most names to be seen on the tombstones are English. They include retired half-pay officers, doctors, shopkeepers, artisans and impoverished gentlefolk escaping their creditors. They had flocked to the Island because of its low taxes and cost of living and found their last resting place in St Georgeâs. Descent from the nobility is not infrequently claimed on the headstones, and at least fifty graves are those of persons with military titles or linked to the same. These were the leaders of âpolite societyâ in Douglas. There are several graves of nonconformists and Catholics in the churchyard.\n\nWhilst the chapel had been consecrated back in 1781, the churchyard had not. Bishop Mason had refused to do so because of loan repayment problems. Although notice was given several times in theÂ Manx AdvertiserÂ during the latter part of 1825 that Bishop George Murray was planning to consecrate the churchyard, it did not happen. Despite the churchyard being on unconsecrated ground, burials took place there up until 1862. At this time, Bishop Horatio Powys had had several private and public rows with the chaplain, the Rev William Hawley, and the wardens of St Georgeâs over various issues, including the continuing churchyard debts. He consequently refused to allow any more burials. A meeting of seat holders was held to protest. They subsequently discussed the matter with the Bishop, and as a result he consecrated the ground on 7 July 1862 and burials continued.\n\nThe first burial â of Matthias Kelly, a shipbuilder â took place on 9 April 1784. The grave, near the south-west corner of the church, is marked by an elaborate and interesting headstone which was erected on 21 October 1841. As well as giving details of the interments, it also gives a brief local history, âcontrasting the state of the Isle of Man then, to what it is nowâ. There are inscriptions in Greek, Latin and Manx. Above the lettering there is a pictorial representation, illustrating a text in Manx, of the Judgement Day: âBeeân cayrn er ny hellym, as bee ny merriu troggit seoseâ (âThe trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raisedâ).\n\nOn its reverse side the stone refers to the coming of cholera. Victims of the cholera epidemics that hit the Island in 1832 and again in 1833 lie under a large open space in the grassed area north of the churchyard, marked by a small plain cross bearing simply the words âCholera 1832-33â. This mass grave contains the bodies of 34 and 86 victims of the disease for the two years. The cholera outbreaks were later vividly described by T E Brown, the Manx national poet, inÂ The Doctor:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â For, if itâs the cholera thatâs in,\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Youâre wantinâ all your strength to begin\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â And courage to that. Aw, ye better belave\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Or send the clerk to dig the grave.\n\nTom Brown was born in 1830. His father, the Rev Robert Brown, held the curacy of St Matthewâs which was situated in the narrow streets of Douglas where defective water supplies and insanitary conditions made it a breeding ground for disease. In 1832 Tomâs godfather, the Rev Thomas Howard who was vicar of Kirk Braddan, moved to St Georgeâs. He offered Robert Brown the curacy of Braddan, well out of town in the open countryside. This turned out to be an extremely fortuitous move in view of the cholera epidemic that would hit the Island later that year.\n\nDuring the dreadful cholera outbreaks, over 200 related deaths occurred in the Island. The victims and the survivors were nursed through the care and love of those who risked their own lives. One name that shines out above all others was Eleanor âNellieâ Brennan (1792-1859). She had been left an orphan at the age of 16 and survived by taking in washing and through her strong Christian faith. When the cholera epidemics took their hold she paid daily visits to the victimsâ homes as well as the cholera hospital on the outskirts of the town to nurse, clean and feed the patients. She was a great believer in hygiene. Although unable to read or write, she was appointed the first matron of the new hospital in Fort Street in 1850. Nellie is buried in a simple grave on the south side of the churchyard.\n\nA further link with the cholera epidemic and St Georgeâs was made when Margaret Squibb, a wealthy widow and a victim of the 1833 outbreak, left her property in Mucklesgate (the earliest surviving recorded street name in Douglas) and Cambrian Place to St Georgeâs to be used as a home for widows.\n\nNear to the cholera burials are many unmarked burials of unknown drowning victims whose bodies were washed ashore. There is only one memorial, a simple cross like the cholera one, in memory of the victims of the shipwreck of theÂ MinervaÂ in 1809.\n\nAnother grave linked with the sea is that of the campaigner Sir William Hillary (1771-1847), who was the founder of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He argued for the building of the Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock in Douglas bay as a place of refuge for victims of shipwrecks (the total cost of the tower was Â£255, of which Â£181 was obtained by public subscription and Hillary paid the balance). He also called for the reform of the unfair import licence system that operated in the Island. In later years Hillary lost most of his money in a bank failure. His tomb is near the east end of the church, on the side of the entrance path.\n\nPierre Henri Josef Baume (1797-1875) was a rich refugee from France who had lived a very unusual early life, including possible incest, murder and infanticide. He had been an international courier and double agent, but in his later years lived as a miser and recluse in The Arches on South Quay. When he died he left his fortune of Â£50,000 in trust to be used for educational and charitable purposes in the Island. His grave is covered by a magnificent monument and is also near the east end of the church.\n\nMembers of the clergy of St Georgeâs buried in the churchyard include Francis Broderick Hartwell, William Hawley, Beauchamp George, Robert Benjamin Baron (who, according to his headstone, was âknown to many asÂ Great Heartâ) and Charles Vincent Stockwood, Archdeacon of Man. Thomas Crellin, the bellringer and organ blower at St Georgeâs for 35 years, has a memorial on the south side of the churchyard which is very tiny but distinctive as it is surmounted by the stone figure of a bell. Other burials connected with the church include its first sexton, James Cunningham and one of its choirmasters, J. B. Mason.\n\nHead teachers at St Georgeâs School (also variously known as the Douglas Daily and Sunday School, the National School, the Lancastrian School and St Georgeâs National School), James Cretney, Miss Ann Crellin and Henry Nicholls, are also buried in the churchyard. The original school was erected (at a cost of Â£1,120) in Athol Street in 1810 and was supported by voluntary contributions. Its 1841 annual report notes that there were 160 boys and 160 girls attending the school to be taught reading, writing and arithmetic. The boys were additionally taught geography âas may be useful to them in after life, should they be called, as many of them are, to visit other and distant lands as seamen or otherwiseâ. The girls learnt needlework âand are thereby fitted to fulfil their stations, as useful members of families, or even if necessary to earn a livelihood for themselves by that meansâ. With the school overflowing, another one in Barrack Street was opened in 1839 for younger children directly connected with the church.\n\nSt Georgeâs is the only church in Douglas to have a churchyard attached to it. It contains many interesting graves. The Isle of Man Family History Society has compiled a detailed list of the remaining decipherable monumental inscriptions."
