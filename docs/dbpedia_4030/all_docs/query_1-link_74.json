        "text": "Old Cairo, otherwise known as Coptic Cairo or Masr al-Qadima, largely predates the city of Cairo as we know it. Some Egyptologists think that a settlement here existed as far back as the 6th century BC. Later, the Romans built on the site a fortress named Babylon. Today, this ancient threshold of history is still in place, its weathered ramparts and sturdy bastions bearing witness to the ebb and flow of civilizations that have graced the fertile banks of the Nile.\n\nAt some point, Christians took over the territory, leaving behind as many as 20 churches in a space of just one square mile. The resplendent 7th-century Greek Orthodox Church of Saint George, rising majestically over the area, is one of the oldest and most prominent of them.\n\nAnother one, emerging as a celestial haven of reverence amid the labyrinthine alleyways of this historical enclave, is the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus. This sanctuary is said to have been built upon the spot where the Holy Family sought refuge during their flight to Egypt and, as such, is a popular pilgrimage site for Coptic Christians.\n\nDeep within the maze of streets, not far from the Coptic Museum, the Ben Ezra Synagogue unveils its ancient mystique, evoking the essence of a storied past. The shrine is famous for its Genizah, a storage area where a vast collection of Jewish religious manuscripts were discovered in the late 19th century.\n\nHigh above the bustling streets, The Hanging Church, also known as the Church of the Mother of God Saint Mary, delicately suspends itself between heaven and earth, supported by the ruins of two Roman towers. A masterpiece of architectural ingenuity and spiritual devotion, this temple is renowned for its beautiful Coptic artwork, intricately carved wooden screens, and historical significance.\n\nIn the heart of Old Cairo, whose stones remember the triumphs and tribulations of generations past, time continues to weave its intricate tapestry. Illuminating it like iridescent gems, the attractions of this venerable district beckon the intrepid explorer with a chance to be transported to a bygone era, where mighty conquerors and revered empires left indelible marks upon the sands of time. If you wish to delve into Egypt's religious and cultural heritage and experience the architectural splendor and historical significance of this unique area, take this self-guided walking tour of Old Cairo."
