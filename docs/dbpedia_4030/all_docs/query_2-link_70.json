        "text": "January 1st - 14th, 2025\n\nGroup Size:\n\nAbout 18 to 20.\n\nOverview\n\nDiscover the contrasts of modern and ancient Egypt on a 14-day adventure. Begin and end in Egypt’s capital Cairo, gaze up at the magnificent Pyramids of Giza, take a four-day cruise down the legendary Nile and explore the grand temples of Abu Simbel. Uncover the secrets of the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple and visit the tombs of ancient pharaohs, share meals with local families and stand in awe of gigantic, rock-cut statues. Accompanied by a local Egyptologist and Lewis & Clark’s own Art Historian Dawn Odell, you will learn about the mystery and beauty of these ancient lands.\n\nHighlights\n\nExplore the Pyramids of Giza, Valley of the Kings, Kom Ombo Temple, Philae Island, Karnak Temple complex and the many sides of Cairo.\n\nTake your time exploring Abu Simbel with an overnight stay, discovering this magnificent monument carved out of the mountainside with less crowds, followed by an incredible sound and light show.\n\nRelax with four nights on a traditional riverboat along the Nile past ancient temples, watching local life unfolding as you get to the heart of each destination.\n\nEnjoy unforgettable authentic experiences, including an overnight train ride to Luxor, a visit to a farm, relax at Cario’s oldest coffee shop and sunset drinks aboard a traditional felucca.\n\nProfessor Odell will discuss Contemporary Egyptian Art, Napoleon’s attempted conquest of Egypt, Howard Carter’s discovery of King Tut’s tomb, and the art of the New Kingdom.\n\nJoin a group of travelers who are inquisitive and adventurous. Benefit from Lewis & Clark’s global network of contacts and experience in Egypt.\n\nItinerary: January 1st to 14th, 2025\n\nThis is a draft schedule but most items are confirmed.

Please do not purchase non-refundable airfare until we have confirmed that.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nWe strongly recommend travel insurance for all Lewis & Clark trips.\n\nA Note About Safety and Security in the Region\n\nThe tragedy that continues to unfold in Israel/Palestine is certainly concerning. Sadly, living in the shadow of these challenging circumstances is more the norm, than not for Egyptian society. Egypt has a large tourism industry and that continues to thrive by fiercely guarding their borders, as well as, specific tourist areas, and monitoring communications and the current conditions (at times you will definitely see and feel that presence of National Security forces). Lewis & Clark has chosen our partners carefully in Egypt to ensure the experience is both educational, interesting and safe. Our partners are locally based, have a long history in Egypt, and LC is confident they will monitor ongoing conditions, and respond well to any situation that might evolve.\n\nIf the circumstances became untenable in the part of Egypt we are visiting we would work with our partners to pause on the trip either rescheduling or giving refunds. We always suggest our travelers purchase travelers insurance. Please be reminded this would be your primary way to receive a refund in case you decided to cancel on your own. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Andrew McPheeters, Associate Vice President, Community Education & Travel.\n\nAccommodations\n\nOvernight Train: Cairo to Luxor\n\nDahabiya: Traditional Nile riverboat. Sailing south from Luxor to Aswan the ship will catch wind in it’s sail motor much of the distance and typically be pulled by a tug-boat upstream.\n\nAcademic Leader\n\nDawn Odell, Associate Professor of Art History\n\nArt History Major Cadyn Schenk-Turner BA ’26 writes about professor Odell:\n\n“She is not just a teacher, but a mentor, a guide, and a source of inspiration. I have had the privilege of being in Dawn’s classroom many times, and I can attest to the profound impact she’s had on my own academic and personal growth. Quite simply, Dawn embodies the very best of what it means to be an educator, a scholar, and above all a compassionate human being. Her relentless pursuit of knowledge and her genuine care for her students sets a standard we should all aspire to emulate.”\n\nDr. Dawn Odell has been teaching at Lewis & Clark for seventeen years. In April 2024, for the second time, Dawn was selected as the Lewis & Clark Teacher of the Year. Professor Odell completed degrees at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Carleton College. Her art history courses include classes that explore art crimes, relationships between art and imperialism, arts of the Silk Road, and the visual culture of modern Chinese cities.\n\nTopics Dawn will discuss on the Egypt trip through presentations and informal conversations are “Contemporary Egyptian Art,” she is especially interested in art produced by Egyptian women and art that blurs the line between art and craft; “Egyptomania,” exploring the impact of Egyptian art on European visual culture in the wake of Napoleon’s attempted conquest of Egypt and of Howard Carter’s discovery of King Tut’s tomb; and “Amarna Period Art,” looking closely at art produced in the eighteenth dynasty of the New Kingdom, which marked a radical change in style and subject matter from earlier periods.\n\nDawn has been an educator to students and alumni alike. In recent years she offered an online course to alumni, and occasional presentations to alumni including one about Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, an eighteenth-century Dutch merchant and immigrant to the early U.S. whose collection of Chinese art was the first to be publicly displayed in an American city. She is completing a book on the same topic.\n\nDawn has traveled the world from Europe to Asia and recently returned from a trip to Korea and Japan, where she was at work on a summer overseas program for our students. Dawn is thrilled to travel to Egypt with Lewis & Clark for this “once in a lifetime experience” and is “looking forward to talking with alumni about art and the powerful ways it allows us to experience the past and understand the present.”\n\nQuestions?\n\nPlease contact Andrew McPheeters, Associate Vice President for Community Education and Travel Programs at: mcpheete@lclark.edu or 503-841-7657\n\nTerms & Conditions"
