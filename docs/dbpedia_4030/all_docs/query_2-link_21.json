Babylon fortress was built by Persians in Pre-roman, Pre-Islamic era. It is also called the Christian Cairo for the presence of multiple orthodox Christian churches and a monastery. In the smaller area of Coptic Cairo, it also contains a synagogue and a mosque. The history of this quite corner of Cairo dates back to 4th century AD. It can be explored by foot and it is possible to visit all the churches even during services. Stunning old churches possess remarkable architecture and interiors. Some of the well-known churches and synagogue include Ben Ezra Synagogue, Church of St George, Churches of St. Sergius (Abu Serga) and St. Barbara and Hanging Church. Coptic city is a great place to wander around during the day and take a dip into the history of Egypt, which was far removed from what you see today.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
