        "text": "Considered the oldest part of Cairo, the Coptic Quarter has its origins centuries before the birth of Christ. It flourished after the death of Christ, when Christianity replaced the declining Egyptian religion. This continued until the Arab conquest in 639 established Islam as the dominant religion.\n\nThe area boasts the remains of the Fortress of Babylon, which is considered the city’s seed. It was built by the Persians in the 6th century BC and later expanded by the Romans, giving it its characteristic appearance of red and white bricks. Some parts of its wall are still visible today.\n\nAs such, the main constructions related to Coptic Cairo are located here. According to Christian tradition, the Holy Family, consisting of Saint Joseph, the Virgin Mary, and Baby Jesus, fled to Egypt to escape King Herod’s persecution. According to the beliefs of this religion, they may have arrived here when Alexandria was the main city, and the population was small, with only a modest river port.\n\nThe Church of St. George (Greek Orthodox) has a notable presence of the Holy Family, as indicated by a well inside the church where the three biblical figures are said to have drunk water. This 10th-century church, rebuilt in the early 20th century, also houses relics of Saint George, a revered warrior saint in other countries.\n\nOne of the most famous and ancient monuments in Cairo is the Hanging Church, which dates back to the 3rd century and was attached to one of the gates of the Roman fortress mentioned earlier. Its name is probably derived from its hanging appearance, although it has lost some of this character due to rising ground levels caused by Nile floods. The entrance staircase is particularly distinctive, and the interior features beautiful 13th-century decorations, including ebony and ivory inlays on the altar and mosaics from different periods.\n\nThe Coptic Museum is another must-see building in Coptic Cairo. It is particularly useful for learning about the shift in beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion and Greco-Roman paganism to the new Christian faith, which adopted symbols from all previous religions. The museum houses objects of enormous value, such as ancient Bibles, manuscripts, and icons. The interior architecture of the museum itself, with latticework and wooden ceilings, is also noteworthy.\n\nBelow are some notable Christian temples in and around the Coptic Quarter:\n\nChurch of Saints Sergius and Bacchus: This church dates back to the 4th or 5th centuries and is named after the Roman Christian martyrs whose relics are preserved here. According to tradition, the Holy Family sought refuge in its crypt for three weeks. Its interior is impressive, featuring beautiful wooden coffered ceilings and columns of marble and red granite.\n\nChurch of St. Barbara: Originally erected in the 4th century in honor of St. Cyrus, this church was later rebuilt in medieval times to house relics of the saint, who was born in Asia Minor.\n\nMonastery of St. Mercurius: This monastery is composed of three small churches, namely, St. Mercurius (10th century), St. Shenute, and the Virgin.\n\nAnother significant temple in Old Cairo is the Ben Ezra Synagogue, which was built in the 9th century when Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra from Jerusalem purchased the land for its construction. While prayers are no longer held here, the synagogue was restored in the late 20th century. According to Hebrew tradition, there was a previous synagogue founded by the prophet Jeremiah, which was later destroyed by the Romans.\n\nDue to its status as the oldest part of Cairo, the Coptic Quarter is also home to various Islamic structures in its vicinity. Following the Arab conquest of Egypt, Misr al-Fustat was established in this area as a military outpost, which later developed into the administrative center of early Muslim Egypt.\n\nOne notable structure in this area is the Amr Mosque, which as mentioned earlier, is considered the country’s first mosque. It was commissioned by General Amr ibn al-As around 640 and played a significant role in spreading the new Islamic teachings. Although what can be observed today is the result of numerous reconstructions, it is still worth including in any list of things to see in Cairo because its interior can be visited during non-worship hours.\n\nIslamic Cairo is a fascinating area of the city that comprises various medieval settlements constructed by different dynasties, including the Abbasids, Tulunids, Fatimids, Ayyubids, Mamluks, and Ottomans. Although the region is sometimes referred to as Fatimid Cairo, after the Shiite dynasty’s founder, who established the city in 969: Al-Qahira (“The Triumphant”), many constructions from the other settlements are also present here.\n\nThe Fatimid dynasty, which ruled North Africa for over two centuries, has left an impressive architectural legacy in this area. However, Islamic Cairo’s other settlements, Al-Askar and Al-Qatta’i, built by the Abbasids and Tulunids, respectively, are equally significant. Later, the Mamluks and Ottomans added new constructions to the area and modified the existing ones. Therefore, any visitor exploring Islamic Cairo should not limit themselves to Fatimid architecture alone.\n\nTo embark on a tour of Islamic Cairo, we can begin by exploring the area that was once the walled medieval city since the end of the 10th century. Al-Muizz street serves as the main axis of this area and leads to some of the most remarkable places to see.\n\nStarting from the northern end of the street, we come across two of the remaining vestiges of the walls that once surrounded the medieval city: the square-shaped Bab al-Futuh gate, which served as the main entrance for centuries, and the semicircular Bab al-Nasr. Adjacent to them lies one of the magnificent mosques to visit in Islamic Cairo, the Al-Hakim Mosque. Named after the sixth Fatimid caliph of Egypt, the mosque was built between the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 12th century. Despite falling into disuse for a long time, the mosque has undergone recent restoration and now features a stunning courtyard with arcades and marble, along with its oldest and most distinguishing elements, the minarets.\n\nContinuing a few hundred meters along Al-Muizz street, we reach the Bayt al-Suhaymi (see the “Museums to see in Cairo” section below) and then come across the Al-Aqmar Mosque without leaving this street. Completed in the early decades of the 12th century, the mosque is unique because it was one of the first to have a stone main facade with an ornamental design. Its most symbolic element is the inscriptions that refer to several Fatimid caliphs and fragments of the Quran. Although its interior has undergone significant modifications over the years.\n\nAs we continue our tour, we come across another fascinating monument in Islamic Cairo: the Sabil-Kuttab of Abdel Rahman Katkhuda. This Ottoman-era building from the mid-18th century served as both a public drinking fountain and an elementary school. It is located in the Bayn al-Qasrin area, which is one of the most beautiful stretches, adorned with other Mamluk-era buildings and a stunning facade. Notable constructions in the area include the madrasa of Sultan Barquq from the late 14th century and the madrasa-mausoleum of Al-Nasir Muhammad, a prolific Mamluk sultan from the late 13th and early 14th centuries.\n\nAnother impressive sight on this stretch is the madrasa-mausoleum of Sultan Qalawun from the late 13th century. This large complex boasts intricate decoration with colored stones and marble panels in many places. It was modeled after the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which the Mamluks had captured from the Crusaders at around that time.\n\nAt this point, you have two options: you can turn left or continue straight. If you opt to go left towards the east, you will reach two significant points of interest: the Jan el-Jalili market and the Hussein Mosque. The Jan el-Jalili market is undoubtedly one of the city’s most popular attractions, and a “must-see” spot in Cairo. Its origins date back to the 14th century, and it offers visitors a vast array of handicrafts, colorful fabrics, the sounds of brass hammering, and the aroma of spices from the food stalls. It is an ideal place to practice the art of haggling to score a good bargain. Additionally, the area features several famous and historic establishments, such as the Fishawi cafe, the city’s oldest, located in Midan Hussein Square, one of the busiest spots in the historic center.\n\nThe Hussein Mosque is situated in the same square and is a must-see for those interested in Islamic Cairo. Although it may not be the most historically or artistically significant mosque in the city, as it was rebuilt in the late 19th century despite its Mamluk-era origins (mid-12th century), it holds special significance for Shiite Muslims. The remains of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad and son of Fatima, are enshrined here, making it a sacred site for Shiites and highly respected by the Sunni majority.\n\nContinuing along Al-Muizz Street from the madrasa-mausoleum of Sultan Qalawun will lead you to Al-Azhar Street, which was created in the 20th century, distorting this medieval axis. Across the street, you will find the Wekalet El Ghoury, a complex housing a madrasa and a mausoleum. However, it is most notably used as a venue for cultural and folk shows. Its stunning architecture is a testament to the Mamluk era (early 16th century), just before the Ottoman occupation.\n\nLocated in Midan Hussein Square on the opposite side of the bustling Al-Azhar street, Al-Azhar Mosque is another breathtaking must-see for tourists in Cairo. As highlighted in our section “Cairo: What to see neighborhood by neighborhood,” the city is home to hundreds of mosques. However, for many travelers, Al-Azhar Mosque stands out above the rest. Constructed in 970 after the arrival of the Fatimid dynasty and the establishment of Al-Qahira, it quickly became a significant Islamic center. It has been a hub for prayer and learning, attracting thousands of Muslim students from all corners of the world annually, and is considered one of the world’s oldest universities. Moreover, its Grand Imam (or Grand Sheikh) is a leading spiritual authority for Muslims.\n\nIts architecture is a delight to the eye, with elements that not only correspond to the Fatimid period but also to later periods, as all rulers wanted to leave their mark on the site. In this sense, the following can be highlighted:\n\nDoors: The main entrance, called the Gate of the Barbers, was named after the area where students’ heads were shaved. Additionally, other interior doors, like the one that provides access to the Central Courtyard, are also noteworthy.\n\nCentral Courtyard: The courtyard is entirely porticoed and stands out for its whiteness and cleanliness. It features Fatimid arches from the 10th century.\n\nMinarets: The mosque has six minarets, with the tallest and most imposing being the one built by Mamluk sultan El Ghoury in the early 16th century. The minarets of Sultan Qaitbey and Amir Aqbugha are from earlier periods, while the two Ottoman minarets are later, with a verticality style that recalls other mosques in Istanbul.\n\nPrayer Hall: The prayer hall has been expanded several times over the years, with the latest being in the mid-18th century by the Ottoman builder Abd-ar-Rahman Katkhuda. The mihrab from the Fatimid period is still preserved.\n\nMadrasas: The mosque has three madrasas dating back to the Mamluk period and a library with around 60,000 valuable volumes, including many manuscripts.\n\nTo the south of El Ghoury and Al-Azhar, the atmosphere becomes even livelier, with countless shops and eateries lining the streets leading to the third and final remaining gate of the Fatimid wall: Bab Zuwayla, built in 1092 and serving as the southern entrance to the city in ancient times. Next to it stands the Al-Muayyad mosque, recognizable by its twin minarets that offer stunning panoramic views of Cairo. Erected during the height of the Fatimid era, the mosque’s interior boasts impressive features, such as the preserved remains of the Mamluk sultan who named it, its central courtyard, and its dome with intricate zigzagging decorations.\n\nAside from these notable sights in Islamic Cairo, many other places of interest await to the south of the Bab-Zuwayla gate. One of the most popular and fascinating markets is the Sharia al-Khayamiya, also known as the Street of the Tentmakers in English, where local artisans, particularly textile makers, can be seen creating their products in real-time.\n\nContinuing further south, you will discover other remarkable mosques that are must-see attractions in Cairo. Among them is the mosque-madrasa of Sultan Hassan, which ranks in the top ten of the city’s Islamic temples in terms of history and art. Built during the mid-14th century by the Mamluk sultan bearing the same name, the mosque has undergone numerous changes, having been used as a fortress in times of conflict. It was even targeted by Napoleon, who found it easily accessible from the nearby Citadel. The mosque’s main entrance is grandiose, and its central courtyard features a beautiful ablution fountain set beneath a vaulted temple.\n\nAdjacent to the mosque-madrasa of Sultan Hassan stands another mosque, Al-Rifai, which bears a striking resemblance to its neighbor, although it was built at the beginning of the 20th century in imitation of the Mamluk style. Its significance, however, lies in the tombs it houses: those of Faruk, the last king of Egypt, and the final Shah of Persia, Mohamed Reza Pahlevi.\n\nBoth mosques are situated in Salah El-Deen square, where one of Cairo’s most popular tourist attractions also stands: the Citadel of Saladin. The citadel was named after Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb, the leader of Islam and a fierce opponent of the Crusaders, who established his command center here in the late 12th century. However, the citadel has undergone numerous renovations and expansions, as each ruler wanted to make their mark. Perched atop a strategic location, it dominates the entire city, as Napoleon’s troops quickly realized when they occupied it during their campaign in Egypt. The stones used to build the citadel have even more history, as blocks from the pyramids of Giza were utilized by the Ayyubid sultan.\n\nEven though some rooms remain closed due to its past as a military barracks until the end of the last century, the majority of the complex is open to visitors, making it one of the best monuments to explore in Cairo. You will discover the following attractions:\n\nWestern Terraces Views: These are among the favorite spots of visitors, along with the minarets of the Al-Muayyad Mosque. On clear days, you can even catch a glimpse of the Pyramids of Giza!\n\nMuhammad Ali Mosque: Without a doubt, this is the most prominent and photographed building of the complex, despite being relatively recent (built in the 19th century) and having a distinctly Ottoman style. The elegant material covering the lower part of the exterior of this temple is alabaster, hence its nickname, the Alabaster Mosque. Inside, you will find the marble tomb of Egypt’s vali, Muhammad Ali. Outside the mosque stands an iron clock gifted by King Louis Philippe I of France in exchange for the obelisk now standing in the Place de la Concorde (originally from the temple of Luxor), which never worked.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad Mosque: This is one of the mosques that survived the demolitions Mehmet Ali ordered for the construction of his mosque. This smaller but older mosque dates back to the 14th century and stands out for its colorful minarets decorated with green and blue mosaics, which are quite unique compared to the rest of the city’s mosques. Unfortunately, they do not shine as brightly as one might expect. Inside, there is a fascinating courtyard with arches that rest on columns from ancient Egypt and the Roman era.\n\nSuleiman Pasha Mosque: Another small and ancient mosque from around 1530, considered the first one built during the Ottoman period in the Egyptian capital. It has an undeniable Turkish style, similar to that of Muhammad Ali and many others in the city of Istanbul, with its characteristic system of domes and semidomes.\n\nBurg al-Haddad and Burg al-Ramla: These military towers are located within the perimeter walls of the complex. The twin towers, known as the Blacksmith Tower and the Sand Tower, controlled access to the interior of the citadel.\n\nMilitary National Museum: (see section ‘Museums to see in Cairo’ below)\n\nPolice Museum: (see section ‘Museums to see in Cairo’ below)\n\nMoving further south of the Citadel and nearing the al-Fustat area, you will discover yet another mosque that deserves your attention, that is, if you still have some energy left! The Ibn Tulun Mosque is one of the most historically and artistically significant buildings in Cairo, and is usually featured in Art History books as an exemplar of its style. It showcases the early Islamic architecture and is the oldest mosque still standing in Egypt. Built by the Tulunids in 879, it exhibits clear Abbasid influence, from which they eventually broke away. One can observe this influence in the helical minaret that is reminiscent of the one in Samarra, Iraq, built a short while before. The mosque’s central courtyard is distinguished by its large-domed ablution fountain, and the surrounding outer wall, which was typical of the period, offers ample space to the enclosure. For a long time, a bazaar was held in the area between the wall and the mosque.\n\nAs you can see, we have dedicated numerous lines to the city’s mosques as they are undeniably among the must-see monuments in Cairo. So much so that many of them are featured on Egyptian pound bills."
