        "text": "Our certified tour guide will greet you in the lobby of your hotel in Cairo or Giza, holding a sign with your name. You'll begin your Cairo day trips by driving through the notorious Garbage City, a settlement in Cairo that appears to be from another world. It earned its name because the inhabitants, who are garbage collectors, recycle the majority of Cairo's waste to make a living.\n\nFinally, you will have the pleasure of visiting the Cave Church, which is renowned in Egypt as the Monastery of Saint Simeon the Tanner, a significant church. This church is associated with a supernatural event where the mountain was moved by the faith of Saint Simeon, as per the locals. It is located in the Mokattam mountain to the southeast of Cairo and is carved into the mountain. To access the church, you will need to pass through a certain route.\n\nYour personal driver and professional guide will take you to enjoy a tour of Coptic Cairo. Following a delicious lunch, you will have the opportunity to explore the ruins of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon, visit The Hanging Church, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and dates back to the 3rd century. This church is built suspended on the two main towers of the fortress. You will also have the chance to visit the church of St Sergius, also known as the cavern church, which is said to have been the home of the holy family during their time in Egypt. Finally, you will visit the Ben Ezra Synagogue, which is likely to be the site of the pharaoh's palace where the baby prophet Moses was discovered in his basket in the Nile River during ancient Egyptian history\n\nAfter you finish your tour of Coptic Cairo and the Cave Church of Saint Simeon, you will be transferred back to your hotel."
