        "text": "The oldest city in the Arab world, Cairo, the richly historic capital of Egypt, is a captivating sprawl of citadels and souks, ancient churches and world-class museums.\n\nFew other cities can lay claim to such monumental landmarks as the River Nile and the Pyramids of Giza, and these will naturally feature high up on any visitor’s hit list, yet much of the joy of Cairo comes from bartering with shopkeepers in Khan El-Khalili souk, sipping mint tea at historic cafés and meandering through the city's tangled backstreets.\n\nThe best neighbourhoods to visit in Cairo\n\nDowntown Cairo\n\nThe Egyptian Museum houses the finest collection of its kind in the world (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIslamic Cairo\n\nAl-Muizz street and the minaret-pierced skyline of Islamic Cairo (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nOld Cairo\n\nThe tenth-century Church of St. George sits right at the heart of Old Cairo (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA few stops on the metro from Tahrir Square, the atmospheric Coptic quarter is where you’ll find most of the sights of interest. Make a beeline for the Coptic Museum, packed with early Christian art and artefacts, including the oldest stone pulpit in existence, before taking in a few of the district’s churches; the Hanging Church, built in 600 AD, is the most memorable of the lot, seemingly levitating between two buildings thanks to a touch of architectural trickery.\n\nGezira island\n\nGezira Island make a wonderful vantage point for appreciating the majesty of the Nile (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe island of Gezira only emerged out of the Nile in the early 1800s, reclaimed from old mudbanks. Sitting right in the centre of the Nile, it’s a great place to appreciate the majesty of this world-famous waterway.\n\nThe Pyramids of Giza\n\nGo deeper\n\nPublished: December 29, 2022\n\nLast Updated: March 06, 2023"
