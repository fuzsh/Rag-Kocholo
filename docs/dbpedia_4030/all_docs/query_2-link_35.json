        "text": "Coptic Christianity holds great significance in Egypt as the country’s second major religion, though it is notably behind Islam in terms of popularity. Historically, it is considered the third major religion, following the ancient Egyptian religion and the Christian faith that spread throughout the Roman Empire. Today, Islam is the majority religion in Egypt and influences its society as explained on another page.\n\nWhen we refer to Coptic Christianity as a major religion, it is not based solely on the number of practitioners or the quantity of temples visible on the streets. Instead, it is due to the religion’s lengthy history and the devoted followers it has garnered, making it a draw for travelers from other countries, especially Christians. To help you understand Coptic Christianity in Egypt, we provide you with some insights, and if you wish, our agency can organize a thematic trip for you.\n\nEgypt has a long history of association with the Christian tradition. In fact, this country is mentioned several times in the Scriptures, as the place where some biblical episodes took place, both from the Old and New Testaments.\n\nOne such example is the story of Joseph (Yussef), son of Jacob, who was forcibly brought to Egypt, sold as a slave by his jealous brothers. He was later accused of adultery and imprisoned, but was eventually released by a pharaoh from the XV dynasty, whose identity is not universally agreed upon. The grateful monarch appointed Joseph as chaty in appreciation for interpreting one of his dreams.\n\nFor Christians and Jews, the journey undertaken by the prophet Moses in the Sinai Peninsula is well-known. During his time there, there were significant episodes that still inspire numerous pilgrimages today, such as the delivery of the Tablets of the Law on Mount Sinai or the miraculous fire on the burning bush, which is now located in the Monastery of Saint Catherine.\n\nHowever, for Coptic Christians in Egypt and around the world, one of the most significant chapters in their faith’s history is the Flight to Egypt, when the Holy Family (the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, and the Child Jesus) was forced to flee to Egypt and live there for a time, as recounted in the New Testament. Today, many places in Egypt are considered important sacred places for Coptic Christianity, as they are associated with this period of the Holy Family’s stay, as we will show below.\n\nCoptic Christianity in Egypt traces its origins back to the early days of Christianity, shortly after the death of Jesus Christ in 33 AD. Egypt was one of the first countries to be evangelized, and tradition holds that Saint Mark the Evangelist was already preaching the faith in Alexandria as early as 45 AD. However, due to the clandestine nature of the religion and persecution by the Romans, it is possible that knowledge of Christianity in Egypt came directly from Palestine.\n\nDuring the early period of Coptic Christianity in Egypt, there were intense debates over the dogmas of the religion. Additionally, certain elements of Ancient Egyptian beliefs and practices may have influenced the development of Christian doctrine. For instance, the Virgin Mary was assimilated to the goddess Isis as both were said to have conceived their children through divine intercession. The cross was also elevated as a symbol of life, signifying Christ’s victory over death. This bears a resemblance to the Ankh in Ancient Egyptian religion, which also symbolized life. Finally, early Christian temples had an area that could not be accessed by the faithful, such as the altar or the iconostasis in Orthodox churches, much like certain areas in Ancient Egyptian temples.\n\nThe legalization of Coptic Christianity in Egypt and its establishment as the official religion occurred concurrently with the rest of the Roman Empire, as Egypt was part of it. This happened under the rule of Emperor Constantine I the Great in 313 and Emperor Theodosius I the Great in 380. The spiritual capital of the country has always been Alexandria, where different patriarchates were established, with Saint Mark being considered the founder.\n\nDuring the time of clandestine Christianity in Egypt, the religion had gained significant ground, but the need for secrecy and persecution led to the emergence of the monastic movement, which became one of the most prominent elements of the religion in the country. This movement may have been influenced by the example of pagan hermits and the extreme conditions of the desert landscape, which invites reflection and meditation. Today, not only surviving monasteries but also spiritual seekers still experience this environment.\n\nSaint Paul the Hermit (or of Thebes) and Saint Anthony Abbot are among the most revered figures of Coptic Christianity in Egypt and by believers worldwide. Saint Anthony Abbot, born in Heracleopolis, is the true founder of the hermitic movement. Shortly after, Saint Pachomius from Luxor regulated that religious and spiritual experience. He is considered the founder of cenobitic monasticism, in which monks withdraw to a communal way of spiritual life.\n\nCoptic Christianity in Egypt has many revered saints, in addition to Mark the Evangelist and the precursors of the monastic movement. Some of the most well-known saints are:\n\nCatherine of Alexandria: She is one of the most revered Egyptian saints among Coptic Christians and is famous worldwide. She was martyred in the early 4th century by Emperor Maxentius for refusing to make sacrifices to the Roman gods and marry one of his wise men. Her intact relics were discovered centuries later in a cave on Mount Sinai and were transported to the Monastery of Saint Catherine.\n\nMenas: Born in Memphis in the late 3rd century, Menas served in the Roman army before becoming a hermit. Many miracles are attributed to him, including his own burial, where his dead body was placed on a camel heading towards Egypt, and the animal stopped permanently near Alexandria, which was interpreted as a divine signal. A monastery (Abu Mena) was founded there, and while the ancient site is now in ruins, a modern and monumental one has been built next to it.\n\nShenouda: Also known as Shenute, he was one of the first abbots of the White Monastery founded by his uncle Saint Pachomius outside of Sohag in Middle Egypt. Shenouda was highly revered for his charisma and is still highly regarded by Coptic Christians.\n\nBishoi: A contemporary of Saint Pachomius, Bishoi founded the monastery that bears his name in Wadi Natrun, and three other monasteries are dedicated to him.\n\nMaurice: Born in Thebes, Maurice was a Christian when it was still prohibited in the Roman Empire. He commanded a legion in the late 3rd century and was sent to Gaul to fight against the Bagaudae. Although they fulfilled their mission, they were executed. According to some theories, this was because they refused to persecute Christian enemies, while others believe it was because they refused to make sacrifices to the pagan gods of Rome. Maurice is better known outside of Egypt but is still a highly regarded saint in Coptic Christianity.\n\nAlthough Coptic Christianity played a significant role in shaping doctrines that were later accepted internationally, it did not prevent a rupture with the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) due to insurmountable differences on certain dogmas.\n\nOne of the most notable differences was in regards to the nature of Jesus Christ. Leaders of Coptic Christianity in Egypt have always defended monophysitism, which asserts that Jesus Christ has only one nature, the divine. However, the majority of branches of Christianity are not monophysite, as they maintain that Jesus had both a human and divine nature, which Copts consider to be blasphemy.\n\nInitially, the thesis of Coptic Christianity in Egypt was triumphant at the Council of Nicea in 325. However, over a century later, there was a turnaround at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which rejected the positions led by the Patriarchate of Alexandria. This resulted in a complete schism, and since then, the Coptic Church has had its own Pope, commonly known as the ‘Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa’. However, it remained under the political umbrella of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIn the context of schism and isolation from the rest of the Christian world, Coptic Christian Egypt was quickly conquered by Muslim Arab troops between 639 and 642, during the expansion following the death of the prophet Mohammed. Interestingly, ten years prior, Mohammed had sent an envoy from Arabia to Byzantium (now Istanbul) to reveal a new religion, Islam, which was flatly rejected.\n\nDespite the Muslim conquest of Coptic Christian Egypt, the previous situation was not completely disrupted, as Christianity remained strong in the new capital, Cairo, and in southern territories of the Nile Valley, including Lower Nubia, supported by the Christian Nubian kingdoms in the south (Dongola, now Sudan). However, the ruling Islamic elites imposed taxes on Coptic Christians in Egypt and provided benefits to converts, gradually undermining the number of Christian followers.\n\nBy the 11th century, the majority of the Egyptian population had converted to Islam, including the far south. Many members of Coptic Christianity in Egypt had retreated to a communal life in their monasteries, seeking protection within their walls.\n\nIt was only in the 20th century, in a more interconnected world than in previous centuries, that these monasteries began to flourish again, with an increase in the number of monks and the funds of their libraries. Tourism has also provided an important boost to Coptic Christianity in Egypt, helping to fund the restoration of its buildings and the maintenance of its traditions. Travelers can explore this fascinating history and culture through our agency, visiting Cairo and some cities of Middle Egypt, among other places.\n\nAside from cathedrals, churches, and monasteries, those who wish to visit Christian sacred sites in Egypt should also take note of other attractions. For instance, there are two sacred peaks in the Sinai Mountain Range that are worth exploring.\n\nMount Sinai is the most well-known of the two, not just among Christians, but also for Jews, as it is believed that Moses received the Tablets of the Law with the Ten Commandments here. Watching the sunrise from its summit is an experience that combines natural beauty and mystical emotion, making it a popular excursion for tourists on vacation in the Red Sea, or as a final destination for religious pilgrimages.\n\nNearby is Mount Catherine, the highest peak in Egypt, towering at 2,642 meters above sea level. According to Christian tradition, this mountain is where angels placed the incorruptible body of Saint Catherine, a martyr saint born in Alexandria, near the previously mentioned Monastery of Saint Catherine. Although it receives fewer pilgrims, reaching the summit of Mount Catherine offers similar views and emotions to those found in Mount Sinai.\n\nAnother sacred site that is much more accessible to everyone is the Tree of Mary (Shagarat Mariam), found in the Al Matariya district in the northeast of Cairo. According to tradition, the Virgin Mary rested under the shade of this sycamore tree. As a result, it is visited by groups of not only Christians but also Muslims and individuals of other faiths. Today, only the tree’s trunk and bare branches remain, twisted into a unique shape, as is typical of this species. It survived the Napoleonic invasion, and some believe that the nearby fountain’s water has healing properties.\n\nThese are just a few of the most prominent Christian sacred sites in Egypt, drawing the attention of numerous foreign visitors. However, many more are scattered throughout the country, which we can help you explore during your trip. Contact us to start planning an unforgettable experience!"
