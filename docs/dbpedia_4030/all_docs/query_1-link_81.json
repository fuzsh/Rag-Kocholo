        "text": "Cairo in three days? Doable! Embarking on a three-day journey in Cairo opens the door to exploring pivotal historical, cultural, and religious sites, providing a comprehensive glimpse into the essence of this vibrant city. Delve into the rich tapestry of Cairo, venture to iconic locations in Giza, Saqqara, Dahshur, and Memphis, and immerse yourself in the captivating stories woven into the fabric of these extraordinary destinations.\n\nOur itinerary:\n\nDay 0: Arrival the night before\n\nDay 1: The Pyramids of Giza, a camel ride, the Sphinx. Hanging out in Zamalek and Dinner with friends (we decided against a cruise down the Nile)\n\nDay 2: Memphis, Saqqara and Dashur. Evening in old Cairo hanging out with the locals\n\nDay 3: The Grand Museum in Cairo, Islamic Cairo and Coptic Cairo\n\nSome additional details:\n\n1. I booked the flights and hotels myself. I found our guide, Andrew Nabil via a recommendation on a Facebook group. I am very grateful we had a guide as he arranged for the transportation (airport to hotel and back and to the various sights). Thanks to a guide, we were whisked through customs and out of the airport, we avoided the constant hounding of street vendors, and got a short cut into the Sphinx, avoiding a long walk. It also helped with the language barrier and I would absolutely use a guide again in Cairo.\n\n2. Cairo was extremely safe. We walked about Zamalek quite late at night and the city was humming. But Zamalek is a safe neighborhood, so know your surroundings\n\n3. We dressed appropriately. I didn’t cover my hair but we also work long pants and tops with sleeves. We did see local women dressed in sleeveless tops and with hair uncovered but dressing appropriately is just respecting the local culture\n\n4. Expect to tip your guide ($15-$20 per person per day) and the driver ($15-$25 per day).\n\n5. Food can be expensive or you can have a most delicious meal at a relatively modest cost in some of the local restaurants\n\nPre-Day 1: Arrival in Cairo and settling in\n\nA beautiful sunset heralded our arrival into Cairo International. Our guide arranged for someone to assist us at the airport, who efficiently handled unloading our bags from the conveyor belt, guided us through immigration, and facilitated the customs process. The airport was chaotic, and without this assistance, we might have spent an additional 30 minutes navigating through the crowd. Our guide, Andrew Nabil, greeted us outside and extended a warm welcome to Cairo. We were curious about his name, and he explained that Christians in Cairo typically only have Christian names, as having second names is not permitted in Egypt; only first names are allowed.\n\nOur journey then led us to the luxurious Cairo Zamalek Marriott, a change of plans from our initial booking in Giza. Acting on the advice of our friend Mansour (Nilesh’s friend from his Heinz days who now lives in Cairo) and Andrew, who warned us about the disparities between online appearances and reality in local hotels, we opted for the Marriott Cairo Casino and Hotel in Zamalek, an American hotel chain. The price difference, though significant, proved to be a wise investment, particularly as we drove past the next day some of the hotels we had initially considered—revealing differences in location, surroundings, and facade from their online portrayals.\n\nThe Cairo Zamalek Marriott, a converted palace, exudes magnificence, and welcomes guests with ornate ceilings, exquisite light fixtures, and an impressive display of artifacts and artwork. Originally built as the Gezirah Palace in the late 19th century for Henriette Pasqualini, a French-Egyptian aristocrat, the Cairo Zamalek Marriott boasts a rich history that includes serving as a royal residence during King Farouk’s reign. Acquired by the Egyptian government in the mid-20th century, the palace underwent meticulous restoration by the Marriott Corporation, preserving its ornate ceilings, grand staircases, and intricate detailing. Today, as a luxury hotel, the Cairo Zamalek Marriott seamlessly combines historical charm with modern comfort. Its prime location on Zamalek Island, overlooking the Nile River, adds to its allure, providing guests with a unique and unforgettable experience that encapsulates the essence of Egypt’s past and present.\n\nOur two rooms on the 8th floor provided breathtaking views of the Nile River and Cairo Tower, adding an extra layer of charm to our stay. The hotel’s amenities, including the pool, gym, and spa, were equally remarkable, even though the unexpected colder weather prevented us from fully enjoying them. In hindsight, the choice to stay at the Marriott Cairo Zamalek proved to be the epitome of luxury and authenticity, exceeding our expectations in every aspect.\n\nAfter 18 years, we reunited with Mansour, who arrived at 11:45 pm to meet us. Surprisingly, Cairo remains vibrant at this late hour, with many restaurants staying open until 2 am. Mansour took us to a quaint dive where we indulged in delectable street food, featuring sandwich platters with a mix of beef liver, beef sausages, and chicken—an absolute delight! The owner graciously extended the opening hours slightly beyond 2 am to ensure we were well-fed, a gesture we greatly appreciated. We returned to the hotel for a brief couple of hours of sleep, as Andrew was scheduled to pick us up at 7 am for our journey to Giza.\n\nDay 1: The Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, a camel ride, followed by a visit to a Papyrus factory, an Aromatherapy store, and a delicious, home-cooked Egyptian meal\n\nGiza, renowned for its iconic pyramids, set the stage for our adventure. Promptly at 7 am, Andrew picked us up, and we fueled up with sweet croissants, fresh orange, and mango juice before setting off. Adil, our skilled driver, adeptly navigated through the bustling Cairo traffic. The streets, store layouts, buildings, and traffic triggered memories of Mumbai, with buses stopping anywhere for passengers and people darting between vehicles to cross streets or hail a tuktuk or bus. The lively scene provided a dynamic backdrop to our journey to the pyramids.\n\nAs we drive towards our destination, Andrew provided historical background: Giza is a must-see destination primarily because it is home to the iconic Giza Pyramid Complex, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The complex includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Sphinx, and other smaller pyramids. These ancient structures, built during the reign of Pharaohs in ancient Egypt, showcase remarkable engineering and architectural achievements that continue to captivate visitors. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, in particular, is the largest of the three pyramids (the other two being the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure), the most famous, and has long been a symbol of mystery and fascination.\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza, or Pyramid of Khufu, is the largest of the Giza pyramids, built around 2560 BC for Pharaoh Khufu. Standing at 146.6 meters, it was built stone by stone, just slotted into each other and then covered in smooth Tura limestone. The Pyramid of Khafre, associated with Pharaoh Khafre, is the second-largest at 136.4 meters, featuring the Great Sphinx nearby. The Pyramid of Menkaure, the smallest at Giza, is associated with Pharaoh Menkaure, standing at 65 meters. These pyramids, built during the Fourth Dynasty, represent remarkable achievements in ancient Egyptian architecture, known for their precision and mathematical proportions. Note that the Pyramid of Khafre, stands adjacent to the renowned Pyramid of his father, Khufu and while it isn’t bigger (the son couldn’t build a bigger pyramid than his father’s) it appears to be taller. The apparent height difference is due to the elevated bedrock upon which the Pyramid of Khafre is constructed.\n\nFrom there we made our way to the Sphinx. With the body of a lion and the head of Pharaoh Khafre, it stands as a colossal guardian near the Pyramids of Giza.\n\nAndrew mentioned that the temple was used to mummify the body first. The body was cleaned with water from the Nile, then the internal organs removed through a careful, precise process. The body was covered and packed in natron, a naturally occurring salt mixture that helped in the dehydration process. Natron absorbed moisture, preserving the body. After the body was dried, it was cleaned, and various amulets and charms were placed between the layers of linen bandages. The wrapping process was meticulous, with each body part wrapped individually. During the mummification process, various rituals and prayers were performed to ensure the deceased’s safe journey to the afterlife. While the body was being mummified, at the same time, the coffins were being built. The wooden coffin was commonly placed inside a stone sarcophagus. The wooden coffin, intricately decorated and inscribed, served as the outermost layer, featuring personalized details like images, texts, and protective symbols. This coffin, resembling the deceased, was considered a crucial element in the burial ritual. The stone sarcophagus, crafted from materials such as limestone, granite, or marble, provided an additional protective layer, often adorned with finely carved inscriptions and symbols. a wooden coffin was commonly placed inside a stone sarcophagus. It was not uncommon in ancient Egypt for a single mummy to be placed inside multiple coffins. The belief was that the multiple coffins provided layers of protection and symbolism for the deceased as they journeyed into the afterlife. Now once the body was mummified and placed in the coffin, a ramp between the temple and the pyramid enabled the coffin to be taken to the pyramid. There it speculated that it was placed in the heavier bigger coffins or sarcophagus.\n\nWe chose not to go inside the pyramids because we were going to do that in Saqqara and we also didn’t visit the Grand Egyptian Museum since a lot of the artifacts were still at the old museum location in Cairo that we were visiting on day 3.\n\nAfter a wonder-filled day, Andrew led us for his treat to Abou Tarek – a famous restaurant located in the downtown area of Cairo, and it has gained a reputation for serving delicious and authentic koshary. Koshary is a classic Egyptian dish consisting of a tasty blend of rice, macaroni, lentils, chickpeas, and spiced tomato sauce. Topped with crispy fried onions and seasoned with garlic and vinegar, it offers a comforting and affordable mix of textures and flavors. Popular as street food and a home-cooked meal, koshary is a beloved dish in Egypt. Following that, Andrew dropped us back to the hotel.\n\nWe took a quick nap and then explored Zamalek. Zamalek is an upscale residential and cultural neighborhood situated on Gezira Island in the Nile River, Cairo. It has a vibrant nightlife scene with trendy bars and lounges and comes alive in the evenings with restaurants packed through 1-2am.\n\nLater that evening, Mans along with two of his absolutely adorable younger kids picked us up an took us to their home, where his beautiful wife, Shireen had cooked up a meal of every possible traditional Egyptian food: Molokhia (A soup made by cooking a large amount of finely chopped jute, which is a green leaf vegetable with a distinctively bitter flavor. Traditionally, the soup is cooked with garlic, coriander, chicken meat or chicken stock, and is usually served with white rice or pita bread, and a lemon or lime wedge on the side. It is believed that the dish dates back to the time of the Pharaohs, its name coming from the word mulokia, meaning Kingdom of Royals, referring to the fact that it was consumed only by the kings, queens, and nobles during the era. Its slimy texture and strong aroma makes it an acquired taste), Ros Maamar (baked rice), vegetables, and an assortment of kebabs and koftas all served with Egyptian bread, salads and tahina. We washed it down with some Egyptian coffee and dessert for the Gods – fresh grapes and oranges! We had such an enjoyable evening with Mans and his family. Their kids were absolutely adorable and our two enjoyed playing with them. The two older kids were in Instanbul for holidays so we hope to meet them some other time. It was also nice to get a glimpse of homes in Egypt – this was a beautifully decorated bungalow, with stone floors and a pretty garden.\n\nDay 2: Sakkara (Saqqara), Dahshur and Memphis\n\nAndrew was already booked that day and sent us his colleague, Carter to show us around. We started by heading out to the countryside to the town of Memphis – once the capital of ancient Egypt. Donkeys seemed to be the mode of transport along with buses and tuktuks (called auto rickshaws in India and Bajaj (for the manufacturer) in Dar es Salaam).\n\nWe stopped at the Memphis Open Air museum, an archaeological site that features a collection of statues, sphinxes, and artifacts. The museum is dedicated to preserving the history of ancient Memphis.\n\nThen we headed to Dahshur, home to the Red Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid.\n\nEver wonder what the inside of a Pyramid looks like? We went into one of the pyramids in Saqqara. We encountered a series of passageways and chambers that lead to the burial chamber deep within the pyramid. The interior features the intricate design and craftsmanship of the ancient Egyptians, with walls adorned with hieroglyphs and scenes from religious and funeral rituals. This is truly an architectural and engineering marvel.\n\nFrom left to right pictures from within one of the pyramids: Hippos and crocodiles shown make this tomb unique; A false door with an offering table. Hieroglyphs are top to bottom and left to right. The door is supposed to be the door to the afterlife where the soul from the afterlife came back for the offerings; The inner tomb representing the offerings to the princess, ad lastly, the outer tomb representing daily life.\n\nThat evening Mans and Shireen picked us up and headed out to what’s known as Islamic Cairo to a restaurant near the Khan El Khalili Market to show us how Egyptian families traditionally spend weekends. Islamic Cairo and Khan El Khalili Market are two iconic and culturally rich areas in Cairo, Egypt, offering a glimpse into the city’s historical and vibrant heritage. Islamic Cairo is renowned for its numerous mosques, madrasas, and other Islamic monuments and is characterized by narrow winding streets, historic buildings, and a captivating atmosphere even at 1am when we encountered street musicians, jugglers and a lot of singing. Khan El Khalili is one of the oldest and most famous markets in the Middle East. This bustling souk is a vibrant hub of commerce and culture, offering a wide array of goods, from traditional crafts and spices to jewelry and textiles. As we walked to the restaurant, we passed a beautiful mosque, stores selling spices of all sorts, and some stores with gorgeous lamps. We passed the Sabil-Kuttab of Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda a historical monument located in Al-Muizz street. It is an architectural complex that combines a sabil (a public water dispenser) and a kuttab (a Quranic school) and in the days of yore, water carriers would come to fill bags of water that were pumped here, and then sell it door to door. You could also come and fill your own water here.\n\nThe restaurant buzzed with multi-generational families seeking a delightful evening. Singers set the mood, with guests enthusiastically joining in, while dancers added to the lively atmosphere. Hookahs and spontaneous singing further contributed to the overall entertainment. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. We feasted on Sahlab, a Middle Eastern sweet milk pudding. It’s creamy, decadent and definitely warmed us up on that cold, winter evening.\n\nHere is a “Tanoura” dancer. The Tanoura dance is a traditional folk dance that originated from the Sufi whirling practices. The dancer wears a large colorful skirt, known as a “Tanoura,” and performs elaborate spinning movements, creating a captivating visual display.\n\nDay 3: The Grand Egyptian Museum, Coptic Cairo and Islamic Cairo\n\nWe started with the Grand Egyptian Museum, designed to house and showcase Egypt’s vast collection of artifacts and treasures, including those from the Pharaonic era, with a focus on the Giza Plateau. The museum houses a lot of the treasures from King Tut. While King Tutankhamun’s reign was relatively short and unremarkable compared to other pharaohs, the circumstances of his tomb’s discovery and the treasures it contained have made him an enduring figure. Unlike many other pharaohs whose tombs were looted in ancient times, Tutankhamun’s burial chamber was found largely intact.\n\nKnowing that the kids have a limited attention span in museums, we headed out to old Cairo also known as Islamic Cairo.\n\nOur first stop was the Citadel:\n\nFrom there we head to what’s known as Christian Cairo or Copic Cairo, the historic and culturally rich areas in Cairo, Egypt, that have a significant Christian presence and heritage. Several ancient churches are located in Coptic Cairo, including the Hanging Church (Saint Virgin Mary’s Coptic Orthodox Church), Saint Sergius and Bacchus Church, and the Church of St. George. Being so close to Christmas, we felt blessed to be able to visit and experience the sites that the Holy Family travelled through.\n\nFrom L to R above: The cavern where the Holy Family stayed was built with a combination of brick and wood, combined to give the building flexibility during earthquakes. An icon represents the life of Jesus and his Passion, painted on wood in the 18th century. Inside the church are 12 columns representing the 12 disciples.\n\nWe wound up our visit with food – the most delicious lamb chops and kebabs. And alas, it was time to leave Cairo."
