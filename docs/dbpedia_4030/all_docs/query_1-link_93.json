        "text": "IN a city whose modern sprawl so often threatens ancient treasures, the Egyptian Government has begun an unusual effort to preserve a religious site that has suffered from years of neglect and bungled repairs.\n\nThe two-year project stands out because it targets not one of the Pharaonic temples or Islamic monuments for which Egypt is better known but a Coptic Christian church in old Cairo, a crowded, gritty quarter often bypassed by visitors.\n\nThe 10th-century basilica, known as the Hanging Church, is built atop the remnants of a far more ancient Roman fortress. Its name refers to its precarious design; the floor of palm-wood beams hangs in midair, supported only at the edges by three Roman columns. It is among the oldest churches of its kind in Cairo, but until the $6.7 million renovation began earlier this year, many here feared that it might be near collapse. The earthquake that rocked the city in 1992 left its walls badly cracked, while layers of paint fell regularly from its ceilings. And although the church has been renovated several times in this century alone, some previous efforts had caused more damage than was fixed. In 1983 an engineer ordered that an interior column be removed, then watched in horror as the chapel ceiling it had supported came crashing to the floor, destroying all the artwork inside the chapel. More recently -- and more worrisomely -- a mysterious pool of ground water that had long sat at the foot of the Roman fortress had begun to rise steadily, carrying salts and bacteria that were weakening the pillars on which the structure rests.\n\nTo some Coptic Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population of 62 million, the fate of the Hanging Church had begun to seem like a metaphor for their ancient community, which many complain has been denied its due respect. But now that the restoration is finally under way, Egyptian antiquities officials point to the church as an example of their commitment to preserving the country's multireligious heritage. ''This is not a pharaonic, Islamic or religious issue,'' said Ali Hassan, then chairman of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, when the decision to go forward with the project was announced last fall. ''This is about restoring monuments.''\n\nOfficially, the site is called the Church of the Virgin, named for Mary, who is reputed to have once stayed the night just a few hundred yards away on the grounds of what is now St. Sarguis Church. The Hanging Church is without domes but has a wooden roof in the shape of Noah's Ark, a symbol of salvation. According to archeologists, the first Coptic church on the site was built late in the third century; the one now standing, itself more than 1,000 years old, replaced a church thought to have burned down. It is decorated with icons carved from ebony and ivory; its three chapels, guarded by carved wooden screens, are dedicated to Christ, St. George and John the Baptist.\n\nTo the devout Copts, the importance of Coptic sites in Egypt has been elevated since 1996, when Pope Shenouda III, the Coptic patriarch, prohibited followers from visiting Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, a ruling meant to protest Israel's hard-line stance in negotiating a broader peace with the Arabs. In Egypt, the headquarters of the church and home to the world's greatest concentration of Copts, church elders say its effect has been to transform the capital into a ''second Jerusalem.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
