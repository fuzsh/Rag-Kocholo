        "text": "Old Cairo and Coptic Cairo\n\nHumans initiated their journey into Old Cairo opposite and below the southern edge of Rhoda Island. Masr al-Qadima is the name given to the region by the Egyptians, which extended it down to a section called Coptic Cairo. Once more, suitable clothing covering the entire body, such as the shoulders and full legs, is obligatory for Islamic and Coptic historic sites.\n\nOld Cairo is so designated because it is Cairo's oldest neighborhood, and it precedes the current city of Cairo. Several Egyptologists presume that a settlement existed here as early as the sixth century BC. After Afterward Romans created a fortress that we now know as Babylon. Some of the Roman walls are still standing. It has ancient Muslim and Christian heritages.\n\nIf you plan to visit Cairo, visit Le Riad Hotel de Charme. It is one of the luxurious hotels residing in the heart of Cairo. This hotel is at the center of most historical places in Cairo.\n\nCoptic Cairo\n\nCoptic Cairo is the spiritual soul of Egypt's native Christian community, a peaceful haven that exposes structures of heritage. Archaeologists discovered remnants of a limited Nile side dating from the sixth century BC on this location.\n\nThe Romans built a fortress here called Babylon-in-Egypt in the second century AD. The title Babylon is perhaps most probable a Roman copy of the Pharaonic signature for old Heliopolis, 'Per-Hapi-en-on' (Empire of the Nile God at On).\n\nBabylon has long been a Christian fortress. More than 20 churches were inside a square kilometer at one moment, but only a few remain today.\n\nThey are connected by thin cobblestone passageways that run among elevated stone walls. The atmosphere is reminiscent of sections of Jerusalem's ancient city. The country's oldest place of worship is located here in Coptic Cairo. It suggests that this may be a matter of chance; when Jews were driven from their holiest town in AD 70, a few took shelter in Egypt.\n\nThe Coptic structure has three entrances. A hollowed stairway beside the metro bridge provides access to many church buildings. The entrance gate in the middle serves the Coptic Museum. Now another hallway ahead south led directly to the Hanging Church. Following are the historical places in old Cairo, or we can say Coptic Cairo.\n\n1.Coptic Museum\n\nThe Cairo Coptic Museum houses the world's most extensive ancient Egyptian Christian art collection. The exhibits tell the story of Egypt seen between the Pharaonic era and Islamic rule.\n\nMarkus Simaika Pasha founded the museum in 1910. After the inventor obtained permission Church of Alexandria, it was constructed on land designated for a Coptic Church. In 1931, it was designated as a State Museum.\n\nThe Coptic Museum's displays are spread across two stories. The third story houses a library with a useful set of ancient Christian Heretical texts discovered near the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi. The library would be only accessible to scholars and historians.\n\nReligious artifacts and items made of stone carvings, plastering work, religious wall paintings, and carved wood objects can be found in the first story.\n\nFabrics, writings, a useful collection of Coptic symbols, and precious metals can be found on the second floor.\n\n2.The Hanging Church\n\nThe Hanging Church is Cairo's most well-known Coptic Church. The Coptic church was one of the first Eastern Orthodox churches, with its headquarters in Alexandria. The Christian Pope's official residence is now the Hanging Church. It was constructed in the seventh century, but it is assumed that churches existed on the site as early as the third or fourth centuries. It was rebuilt several times, most notably within the tenth century by Patriarch Abraham.\n\nThe Hanging Church has a lovely courtyard surrounded by religious tiles. The 13 pillars of the marble chapel portray Jesus and the twelve apostles. It is renowned for its symbols, the oldest of which dates from the eighth century. The sanctuary screen is constructed of ebony engraved with tusks and dates from the twelfth or early 13th. It has seven major symbols in a row. The left display contains 17 icons, while the right has 7 symbols at the top. The church is a flourishing spot of worship, where important events such as the ascension to the throne of patriarchs happen.\n\n3.Mosque Of Amr Ibn Al-As\n\nThe Mosque of Amr ibn al-As, Egypt's and Africa's earliest mosque, was constructed in 642-643 (22 AH) in Amr ibn al-'Al. However, its existing appearance does not correlate with the initial mosque structure.\n\nDuring the rule of the Umayyad Caliph Muawiyah I, this mosque was completely renovated, and a minaret was added. Around 711 (92 AH), a slightly curved prayer area was added to the mosque. The mosque was built to its existing measurements in 827 (212 AH), with seven aisles constructed ahead of the prayer segment. The 4 minarets at the edges that were in place at the time have vanished.\n\nThe mosque was delivered as a meeting place for the Muslim community and 'Amr's troops in the early years after the conquest.\n\n4.The Babylon Fortress\n\nThe Babylon Fortress takes its name from the Mesopotamian City of Babylon. Later, it was where Roman King Trajan stationed his vast armies to suppress the Egyptian people. It served as the border between Lower and Middle Egypt at that point. Nowadays, it is a member of Coptic Cairo, in which the City's Christian population resides. The fortress tried to defend the city against the Arab invasion of Egypt for 7 months before being overrun by Commander Amr Ibn Al As' army.\n\n5.Ben Ezra Synagogue\n\nIt is Egypt's oldest house of worship. The Egyptians and some American Jewish restored the place of worship in the 1980s. It now continues to serve as a gallery and no longer provides services. The synagogue is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n6.St. George's Church\n\nBack on the main street, the Greek Abbey and Chapel of St George are reached via the initial hallway north of the gallery door. St George is a popular Christian paragon of virtue in the area. Since the tenth century, there's been a church devoted solely to him at Coptic Cairo. Fires destroyed the interior, but the flecked window frames and tile roof is still bright and vibrant. The nearby monastery is not open to the public.\n\nFinal Words\n\nOld Cairo combines many civilizations like Christians, Muslims, Jews, and, Romans This place is too old and has a vast history of heritages and fascination. The architecture depicts the high civilization of those nations, which persisted in Cairo centuries ago. It is a worthwhile place to tour around and watch what magnificent history the new Cairo possesses."
