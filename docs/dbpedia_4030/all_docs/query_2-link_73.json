A sarcophagus was found, but it was empty.\n\nChephren pyramid: Chephren was the son of Cheops, his pyramid looks bigger to the untrained eye than that of his father. This is a fallacy since the Khafre pyramid is simply a little higher.\n\nMykerinos pyramid: Menkaure, in turn, was the son of Khafre, he is the smallest of the three pyramids. Statues found in the Mykerinos pyramid can be seen today on display in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nThe last remaining of the ancient wonders of the world was built between 2620 and 2500 BC by around 10,000 workers.\n\nThe pyramids are located on a site previously used as a cemetery for pharaohs.\n\nThere are no records whatsoever about the construction of the pyramids, so scientists and archaeologists are still puzzling today about how the stone blocks, which weigh up to 2.5 tons, could be piled up in a relatively short time.\n\nAlso, the architecture has such precision that can only be achieved with the most modern technology and can therefore hardly be explained.\n\nThe myth of the pyramids also includes the fact that they are practically empty: neither the grave goods typical for systems of this type nor mummies could be recovered. so it considers the great ancient Egypt landmarks\n\nDid you know there are more pyramids in the area than just the three famous Pyramids of Giza? Several other pyramids may be found in Saqqara, which is not far to the south of Giza. These pyramids include the “step” pyramid of Djoser and the “red” pyramid in Dahshur.\n\nTo enjoy the beautiful landscapes of the pyramids, check out our Camel Ride in the Pyramids of Giza, and if you want to enjoy exploring all the pyramids inside that area, check out our Memphis, Saqqara, and Pyramids of Giza Tour\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Al Haram, Cairo, Egypt\n\nDistance from Cairo: approx. 15 km\n\nDistance from Hurghada: approx. 470 km\n\nDistance from Sharm El Sheikh: approx. 520 km\n\nDistance from Marsa Alam: approx. 750 km\n\nFun Fact: Truly impressive and hardly explainable is that the pyramids are aligned exactly in the four cardinal directions and at right angles.\n\n3- landmarks in Egypt: Great Sphinx of Giza\n\nThe Great Sphinx of Giza is an imposing sculpture with a human head and a lion’s body located next to the Pyramids of Giza. It is one of the most historical and emblematic landmarks in Egypt and the whole world.\n\nThe enigmatic Sphinx has a height of about 20 meters and a little more than 70 meters long and is endowed with a human head and a lion’s body, something that ancient Egyptians gathered in the exact figure of intelligence and strength. Even so, it is almost wholly preserved as it was covered by sand most of the time.\n\nOver the years, the Sphinx has been revised again and again and was last uncovered in 1818. Still, it is no longer allowed to be excavated because the Egyptian authorities are afraid of any damage to the monument.\n\nCurious facts about Egyptian landmark” the Great Sphinx of Giza”: Why doesn’t it have a nose?\n\nThis is another mystery that has never been solved. The rock from which the sphinx was built varies according to its parts. The solid body is made of soft yellowish limestone and the head of hard gray limestone. So logic suggests that the nose should have been better preserved, as is the case with the rest of the sphinx’s head in relation to its body. But to this day, it has disappeared.\n\nSome theories blame Napoleon for its destruction, but it is a hypothesis that was dismantled after the discovery of some drawings made by an explorer who visited long before the birth of the famous French emperor and in which the sphinx already appeared without his nose.\n\nOther versions speak of a Muslim leader of the fifteenth century named Muhammad Sa’im al-Dahr who, offended by seeing so many people worshiping the sphinx, ordered to destroy his nose. But the mystery remains unsolved. It was full of colors.\n\nToday the sphinx retains almost none of the vivid colors it once wore and to appreciate any remaining color you have to get very close (or as close as is allowed inside the enclosure). Its loss of colors is due to the erosion of the desert. It is believed that the body and head were red, and the headdress with an Egyptian garment that covered his head with white and blue stripes.\n\n.\n\n4-landmarks of Egypt: Egyptian Museum\n\nThe Egyptian Museum has the largest collection of Pharaonic artifacts in the world and is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. The museum has a lot of artifacts from the Predynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Period. so it considers one of the landmarks in Egypt\n\nIn 1895, the building’s architect was chosen through the first-ever international competition, which was won by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon. Khedive Abbas Helmy II opened the museum in 1902. It is now a historic landmark in downtown Cairo and is home to some of the world’s most beautiful ancient works of art.\n\nThe complete burials of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette, which shows that Upper and Lower Egypt were united under one king, are all part of the museum’s unbeatable collection. The Narmer Palette is also one of the museum’s most valuable artifacts. The great kings Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, built the pyramids on the Giza plateau. The museum also has beautiful statues of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. This huge museum also has an extensive collection of papyri, coffins, and jewelry, among other things.\n\nTherefore, more museums are now being (expanded). What is special about the Egyptian Museum is that, in contrast to European museums, for example, it only shows Egyptian exhibits.\n\nBut this is also due to the incredible number of preserved exhibits.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nAddress: Tahrir Square, Cairo Governorate, Egypt.\n\nOpening times: Mon, Tue, Fri, Sat: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thu & Sun: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nFun Fact: In 2010 a section for children was also opened, there is child-friendly information about ancient Egypt, and the most important artifacts such as Tutankhamun’s death mask were made from Lego bricks.\n\n5- Coptic Quarter of Cairo\n\nThe popularly called Coptic Quarter is located in one of the oldest areas of Cairo, known as Misr el-Qadima, where the oldest remains are those of a fortification from the time of Trajan, which was called Babylon by the Romans.\n\nThe word Coptic derives from the ancient Egyptian language and is used as an appellative to designate the early Christian religion of Egypt. Despite the Arab invasion and the spread of the Islamic religion throughout the country, the Coptic Orthodox Church remained powerful and influential for many centuries and is now the second religion in Egypt.\n\nNumerous churches and monasteries were built on this site, which is considered sacred by both Jews and Christians, whose tradition states that the Holy Family rested in a cave on the site when they arrived in Egypt.\n\nMonuments in the Coptic Quarter include the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, considered the oldest church in Cairo, the Church of St. George, the Convent of St. George and the Church of St. Barbara among others.\n\nA Jewish synagogue, of great historical value but not currently used as a place of worship, can also be visited.\n\nAmong the many Coptic churches that can be visited, el-Moallaqa, also known as the “Hanging Church”, stands out. This is the nickname of the Metropolitan Church of St. Mary the Virgin, which was erected on the site of the ancient Roman colony of Babylon in the 4th century AD. The church is built just above the Roman fortifications, with its nave suspended over the passage of the entrance gate.\n\n6- Historical landmarks in Egypt: Muhammad-Ali Mosque\n\nThe mosque is located inside the Citadel of Saladin, built by the sultan of Egypt, its purpose was to protect the city from the attacks of the Crusades. On top of Mount Muqatam, southeast of what was the ancient Fatimid capital, allowing it to be visible from anywhere in Old Cairo, and was the largest mosque built in the first half of the nineteenth century. makes it one of the primary ancient Egyptian landmarks.\n\nAdditionally, approaching it from anywhere in the city, it stands imposingly on the heights, which undoubtedly motivates you to visit it. Further, its location within the citadel is an escape from the bustling lifestyle of Cairo, as walking through its calm interiors allows you to enjoy it from a different perspective.\n\nThe plan of the mosque was modeled after Ottoman mosques, with a large central dome over 52 meters high bordered by smaller semi-domes and two stylized minarets at its corners. The Muhammad Ali Mosque is also known as the alabaster mosque because of its interior and exterior covering, made of this material.\n\nThe mosque has a rectangular shape and has two sections: the main “Beit al-Salah” to the east and the courtyard or “Al-Sahn” to the west. The eastern part is dedicated to prayer and has a unique decoration made partly with wood carvings and with style resulting from the French influence. It has 100 stained glass windows on the walls and domes that cause a beautiful effect inside—sitting calmly on its carpets while admiring the hundreds of lamps that are located on the ceiling.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Al Abageyah, Qism El-Khalifa, Al-Qahira Governorate, Egypt\n\nEntry: free of charge\n\nVisiting hours: The mosque can be visited outside of prayer times.\n\nArrival: The journey from the tourist centers in Egypt is similar to the pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Egyptian Museum.\n\nTip: From the Muhammad-Ali mosque, provided the smog is not too strong, you have a great view over all of Cairo!\n\n7- Major landmarks in Egypt: Khan el Khalili\n\nAmong the many Egypt landmarks attractions, you can explore in Cairo, be sure to include a tour of the Khan el Khalili market in your plans.

After seeing all the important ancient Egyptian sites, the Cairo Tower is a great way to get a bird’s-eye view of the city as it is now.\n\nThis observation tower is the tallest building in Egypt and North Africa. It is 187 meters high. The building is made in a modern style that makes it stand out from the older buildings in the city. It looks like a lotus plant.\n\nWhen you go to the observation deck, you can see the whole city in every direction. You can see the Pyramids of Giza, Sakkara, the Citadel, and a lot more from here.

The walls of this mega-sculpture house seven churches, plus a fully equipped cafeteria and rooms available for rent and use by visitors and travelers.

The only certainty is that it finally disappeared.\n\nIn 1987 an international project was initiated to rescue the cultural significance of the site and the symbol that the mythical library represents in the collective imagination of humanity.\n\nUNESCO coordinated the project and finally, under the name of Biblioteca Alexandrina, it was inaugurated in 1996.\n\nIn 2002 the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina was opened, which is close to the original location and has around eight million books.\n\nAbout half of the building is filled with a huge reading room.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Al Azaritah WA Ash Shatebi, Qesm Bab Sharqi, al-Iskandariyya Governorate 21526, Egypt.\n\nDistance from Cairo: approx. 215 km\n\nDistance from Hurghada: approx. 680 km\n\nDistance from Sharm El Sheikh: approx. 735 km\n\nDistance from Marsa Alam: approx. 960 km\n\nGood to know: The integrated Taha Hussein library also offers the visually impaired the opportunity to experience literature.\n\n13- Citadel of Qaitbay\n\nThe citadel is located at the entrance of the port of Alexandria in Egypt, on what was once the island that housed the famous Alexandria lighthouse, which now forms a peninsula that divides the port into its eastern and western parts.\n\nThe citadel was built on the orders of Sultan Al-Ashraf Abu Alnasr Saif El Din Qaitibay, who came to Egypt as a slave when he was nearly 20 years old and rose to power during the Mamluk period.\n\nIt was built as an element for the defense of the city and the Mediterranean coast, during the 1480s. Sultan Quaitbay ordered its construction on the same site where the lighthouse once stood, and took advantage of its remains. Its defensive architecture and strategic position give it great relevance.\n\nDuring the British invasion of 1882, it suffered severe damage due to the bombardment of British ships, but soon after it was rebuilt. Today it is a beautiful promenade that locals and tourists take advantage of to enjoy the sunsets, the sea breeze in the warmer months, and the views of the city.

It is believed that it was originally intended to be used as a family tomb, but with the successive changes in power, and the construction of new tombs, the valley became a necropolis that remained in use for over 400 years.\n\nThe Valley of the Kings is made up of two parts: the Valley of the East and the Valley of the West. The first is one of the most visited places by tourists and is where most of the tombs are located. It includes 62 tombs that were originally numbered as they were discovered, but have now been renumbered according to their location within the valley.\n\nThe most known and visited tombs are those of King Thutmose I, Thutmose III, Ramses VI, Mrenptah, and Amenhotep II; however, the tomb of Tutankhamun (Tut-Anj-Amun) is the one that has deserved more fame, because until today is the only one to have been discovered with all its treasures, as it remained buried and therefore out of reach of looters until 1922.\n\nAfter Tutankhamun’s burial chamber was opened, the legend of the pharaoh’s curse spread quickly, according to which archaeologists would die a cruel death.\n\nAs a result, some of the people involved in the excavations died, many of them by suicide for fear of the curse.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Luxor, Al-Wadi al-Jadid, Egypt\n\nTip: To protect the important historical finds, there is a rule that each visitor is only allowed to visit three graves.

A gigantic stone hall and finely decorated columns make Karnak a very special experience.\n\nThe facility was used to hold sacrificial presentations and prayers to appease the gods. This had to be done by kings or specially trained high priests to maintain world order.\n\nTherefore, the temples of ancient Egypt were of enormous importance, which explains why the temples, which were considered a small model of the world, were so carefully maintained and previously furnished.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Karnak, Luxor Governorate, Egypt\n\nFun Fact: Unlike the pyramids, which are west of the River Nile, the Karnak Temple is on the east side, dedicated to the living and the living.\n\n18- Ancient Egyptian landmarks: Aswan\n\nAswan is located on the cataract north of the Nile, Aswan marked the traditional southern border of Egypt with the enemy territory of Nubia, it had great importance in the ancient Pharaonic era on the historical and security side, when we read the ancient Egyptian history we can see that the city of Aswan has contributed a remarkable role in history and battles against enemies who wanted to conquer Egypt, the Nile River also played a very important role in the economy and politics.\n\nit is a popular Egypt famous landmark and sought after by tourists thanks to a large number of ancient monuments and statues that have written a great civilization to study and visit to discover the power of the Egyptian pharaohs and how they managed to build a history to study until the present time. These two civilizations contested each other’s territory and their respective areas of influence for centuries.\n\nIn the course of this conflictual relationship, Aswan always remained a border town between the two territories, not only politically, but as an economic and natural intersection, prosperous commercial city, and transit point between Egypt and the rest of Africa.\n\nThis island was of vital importance both for the Egyptians and subsequently for the Romans. Inside you will find the Nilometer, an ancient well that was used to measure the height of the river’s waters.\n\nBut the most important archaeological site in the area is certainly the Temple of Philae, which preserves the beautiful Sanctuary of Isis and the cell that preserves the sacred figure of Horus.\n\nWe recommend that you visit the Nubian Village just outside the city of Aswan, then go to the High Dam built-in 1960, from which you can enjoy a beautiful view of Lake Nasser.\n\n19- Egypt historical sites: Temple of Philae\n\nOne of the most beautiful temples in Egypt – You have to take a small boat to get there, and you will have a view of Egyptian sites and monuments surrounded by water and palm trees.

This is typical Nubian architecture. All of these materials are natural, so they are less likely to spread diseases. They are also cheap, and the bricks’ clay texture is less affected by heat. Each house has a ceiling in the shape of a dome, which is meant to spread the sun’s heat evenly throughout the house. The Nubian people also love to decorate their homes with simple but beautiful colors. They also often draw shapes from their culture, like boats, camels, and palm trees, on the walls of their homes.\n\nPeople know that Nubian villages are small and quiet. The same could be said about how a traditional Nubian home is set up inside. What is unusual, though, is the choice of a crocodile as a house pet. Don’t worry, though, because these crocodiles are kept in cages. In Nubian homes, both living and mummified crocodiles were hung and admired very much. The Nubian people like crocodiles because ancient Egyptians thought that having a crocodile around would protect them and their families from the “evil eye.” You could also find chickens and goats, which are more common.\n\n.\n\nFor those who like to shop and take a souvenir of the places they pass, in Nubian Village you will find many options of super different and original crafts.

The reliefs represent the pharaoh making offerings to the gods and preparing the construction of the temple.\n\n24-Dendera Temple complex\n\nThe Dendera Temple complex, considered one of the best preserved in Egypt, is located southeast of the city of Dendera, on the west bank of the Nile River, 60 km north of Luxor.\n\nThe entire complex covers an area of 40,000 square meters and is bounded by a mud-brick wall.\n\nThe cult temple, dedicated in 380 BC to Hathor, the goddess of love, joy, and beauty, was formerly known as the sistro castle or the house of Hathor.\n\nThis impressive temple is considered to be the largest and most impressive building in this religious complex.\n\nHowever, the complex also includes the temple of the birth of Isis, the sacred lake, the sanatorium, the mammisi of Nectanebo II, a Christian basilica, a Roman mammisi, the monumental gates of Domitian and Trajan, the sanctuary of the boat and a Roman kiosk.\n\nThere are indications that the complex was originally erected at the hands of Pharaoh Pepi I (circa 2250 BC) in the 18th dynasty (circa 1500 BC), but the oldest building it houses is the mammisi of Nectanebo II, the last indigenous pharaoh of Egypt (360-343 BC).\n\nThe temple of Hathor referred to in earlier times as the Temple of Tentyra, has undergone several renovations beginning in the Middle Empire, although the present structure was built during the reign of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VII in the extinct Ptolemaic Empire. In fact, carved on the outer face of one of the walls of the temple we find a colossal relief of Cleopatra VII and her son Caesarion, heir of Julius Caesar.\n\nLater some additions were made until the time of the Roman Empire, such as the Roman mammisi or “the house of birth”, attributed to the Roman emperor Trajan but built by Nero.\n\nAlso, since Hathor was also the goddess of healing, the city of Dendera has always been associated with the healing of travelers and pilgrims, who sought a remedy for their illnesses and the blessing of the gods.\n\n25-The Colossi of Memnon\n\nThe Colossi of Memnon, which are on the western side of Luxor, are some of the most famous and beautiful monuments that the Pharaohs left behind.\n\nThe Colossi of Memnon are the only visible parts of Amenhotep III’s tomb temple, which was near Medinet Habu.\n\nThe Colossi of Memnon were made during the reign of Amenhotep III (1386-1349 B.C.). These two large stone masses are big versions of this king, whose reign was a time of splendour and when the arts were at their best.\n\nThe king is shown sitting on a throne with his hands on his legs. He is wearing the Nemes headdress, which is typical of the Egyptian monarchy, and the shape of the protective cobra on his forehead can still be guessed.\n\nTop Egypt landmarks: Egypt Oases (Siwa & Bahariya)\n\n26- Siwa Oasis\n\nSiwa is a beautiful oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert that is full of greenery. It used to be called “Sekht-am,” which means “palm land” in ancient Egyptian. The name of the oasis is a perfect match for its famous palm trees. The oasis is also famous for its olive trees and clear salt lakes.\n\nA wonderful, mind-blowing paradise. Siwa Oasis is located in the Libyan desert in the northwest of the country.\n\nThere you can marvel at olive trees and date palms in the middle of the desert. It was not without reason that Alexander the Great loved this unusual place, because the ruins of the Amun temple, where his familiar oracle is said to have stayed, still stand here.\n\nYou can also discover the remains of the old clay town of Siwa. Various Bedouin peoples still live in Siwa today, and their marketplace, mosque, and local museum should also be on your to-do list when you visit them.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Qesm Siwah, Matruh Governorate, Egypt\n\nDistance from Cairo: approx. 750 km\n\nDistance from Hurghada: approx. 1,200 km\n\nDistance from Sharm El Sheikh: approx. 1,270 km\n\nDistance from Marsa Alam : approx. 1,500 km\n\nFun Fact: Alexander the Great wanted to be buried in Siwa, but this request was not followed by the ruling Pharaoh.\n\n27- The Salt Lake at Siwa Oasis\n\nOne of the best experiences you will have in Siwa. You don’t actually need to travel to the Dead Sea to float on the water instead of swimming, you can just go to Siwa.\n\nNot to mention its beauty and curative effect. Due to its extreme salt, it has healing power for sinuses, skin, and eye infections.\n\nBesides, Siwan’s use salts in building and their tools and also in making lamps because they have the power to heal the soul by eliminating negative energy.\n\n28- Bahariya Oasis\n\nBahariya Oasis, one of the oases that are easiest to reach from Cairo, its landscape is enclosed by high ridges and is dotted with date plantations, as well as freshwater sources.\n\nIn recent years it has also been made famous for important archaeological finds such as the “golden mummies” found in 1996.\n\nThe administrative capital Bawiti hides other treasures: fertile palm groves that guard springs such as that of El-Beshmo, discovered in Roman times, or Bir Ramla which has sulfurous water at more than 40 degrees of temperature.\n\nOn the hillock of Qasr Salim, in the heart of the village of Bawti, the remains of two tombs of the ancient XXVI dynasty are visible. The Oasis Heritage Museum offers clay reproductions of rural life.\n\n29- White Desert\n\nIt is capable of leaving you breathless: the Sahara El Beyda, or the white desert. It extends between the oasis of Farafra and that of Bahariya, on the border with Libya.\n\nThe magic is all in the immaculate color of the sand but not only. Even the extraordinary rock formations give an unusual aspect to the whole environment as well as the colors that the sky takes on at different hours of the day and night.\n\nWhere there is now the desert, once (5 thousand years ago) there were springs, rivers, lakes, and animals of every kind. Today traces of that distant past remain in the sand.\n\nOver 2 square kilometers of magic. Which includes the Mount of the Dead, an archaeological area with the Temple of Amun, and the famous Cleopatra’s pool with its emerald green waters.\n\nToday the White Desert is a national park. Every August it is cleaned after the passage of tourists. A blinding glow characterizes it. The limestone forms areas similar to sea waves, where hundreds of fossil shells bear witness to the voice of the sea from millions of years ago.\n\nThe Most famous landmarks in Egypt: The Red Sea (Hurghada, Marsa Alam & Shael El Sheikh)\n\n30- The Red Sea\n\nWhat would Egypt’s sights be without the Red Sea? There is still much speculation about the name of the not-so-red Red Sea.\n\nFirst of all, the name Eritrea is based on Greek and means something like red – the lighting conditions that make the land around the sea appear red also contribute to this.\n\nThere is also a large occurrence of a special type of algae that also makes the sea glow reddish. Regardless of the reasons, it has been called ” Mare Rubum “, or the Red Sea, since ancient times.\n\nAs in the national park, you can of course also enjoy the wonderful, clear water and colorful reefs at the beaches of the sea. You should only dive and snorkel under the supervision of a guide, as the currents can be very strong and sudden.\n\nAlso for surfers, the Red Sea is an absolute highlight. Enjoy the water, regardless of whether it is just for relaxation or sports.\n\nInfo & Tips: In our Egypt travel guide, you will find articles about snorkeling in the Red Sea and diving in Egypt. Here you can find out everything you need to know about the Red Sea and its underwater diversity.\n\n31- Hurghada\n\nIf you are looking for things to do in Egypt, you should include Hurghada in your planning! The marine life is very rich there, not to mention the wonderful turquoise beaches!\n\nHurghada is one of the cities on the Red Sea with the best structure for tourism. It is an excellent destination in Egypt to relax by the sea because, in addition to the paradisiacal beaches, there are many shopping options, restaurants, clubs, and resorts.\n\nDiving in that turquoise water is one of those memorable trips you will have in Egypt. A great tip for you to include in your experiences in Egypt is to take a snorkel tour on the tour to the Giftun Islands.\n\n32- Marsa Alam\n\nOn the south coast of the Red Sea, there are other options of super cool beaches, each with a style. In the case of Marsa Alam, in addition to being outside the most traditional tourist route, it is the most trendy diving destination in Egypt today due to the rich marine nature, with incredibly colorful corals, manatees, and dolphins, for example.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, one of the top destinations in Egypt that I visited during my trip! It is always nice to visit a little-explored place and Marsa Alam is one of those places with an air of untouched paradise. I recommend it for those who want to venture out, either by discovering a new destination or by diving.\n\nI am already a certified diver, but for those who just want to try this activity, it is possible to hire a diving experience in Marsa Alam.\n\nIf you want to know one of the paradisiacal beaches in Egypt and get all the details about going to Marsa Alam, check out this article here.\n\n33- Sharm El Sheikh\n\nThe beauty of this well-known tourist destination on the southern tip of Sinai has a thousand facets not only related to the beaches and the blue-green sea with fish of a thousand colors. One is enchanted, for example, to admire the night sky full of stars.\n\nIn the evening, after a day of relaxation, you discover the old town and the Old Market, while inland the Bedouin fields scented with embers and hookahs.\n\nHere the gray rock hides the cemeteries of the dromedaries against the backdrop of rugged mountains where jewels such as the Byzantine-style Monastery of St. Catherine are hidden.\n\nThe real surprise is to discover, in an arid landscape, gardens of olive trees and vines, thanks to the water from the wells.\n\nFor centuries, the fortress built by Justinian has been the garrison of the monks in a place where the stories of the three monotheistic religions meet. Here where his fate was announced to Moses.\n\nAnd then there is the seabed that attracts crowds of snorkelers and scuba divers. Thirty kilometers of rugged and rocky coastline that opens into beautiful beaches and sudden inlets.\n\nFrom the north of El Nabq to the lively Sharm El Maya. From the quiet beaches of Ras Nasrani, you can enjoy the view over the island of Tiran.\n\nThe center of holiday tourism is in Naama Bay, full of night attractions, souvenirs, and a clear sea.\n\nThe most beautiful coral reef in the Red Sea is located in Ras Um Sid, where the desert with the colors of sunset and morning offers moments of absolute enchantment.\n\n34- Ras-Mohammed National Park\n\nRas Mohammed National Park is a place for conservation. It was Egypt’s first national park when it opened in 1989, and the country is very proud of it. It was made to protect the species that are representative of both plants and animals, as well as their natural growth.\n\nThe park is 480 square kilometers in size, and more than two-thirds of that is water. The park’s land is made up of two islands: Tiran and Sanafir.\n\nRas Mohammed National Park, also called “Cape of Mohammed,” is in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, about 25 km southwest of Sharm el-Sheikh. It is on the coast of the Red Sea. Some of the best places to snorkel in the world are in the southernmost part. Corals that are about two billion years old can be found in the park.\n\nLake of Desires and Salt Lake are two very different lakes in the park. The water in the first one is partially salt-free because it comes from fresh springs that bubble up from the ground. The second lake is fed by unique salt springs, so its water is twice as salty as the sea.\n\n.\n\nIn this park, you get a lot on offer so that almost nothing is left to be desired in terms of outdoor activities. From mountain bike tours to swimming or snorkeling, everything is on offer. The underwater world can trump nature on land by a lot. Here you can marvel at exotic fish and marine animals amidst colorful coral reefs. Divers get their money’s worth in the Ras-Mohammed National Park.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Sinai, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt\n\nDistance from Cairo: approx. 490 km\n\nDistance from Hurghada: approx. 125 km (ferry)\n\nDistance from Sharm El Sheikh: approx. 40 km\n\nDistance from Marsa Alam: approx. 420 km (car + ferry)\n\nFun Fact: The Yolanda Reef was named after the ship of the same name that sank on the spot in 1980. The remains of the ship may not be dived for conservation reasons, but parts of Yolanda’s former cargo can be found everywhere in the reef: toilet bowls and sinks. Curious!\n\n35- Catherine’s Monastery in Sinai\n\nSt. Catharine Monastery at the foot of the Sinai is the oldest, still living, Greek Orthodox monastery in the world.\n\nIt was completed in its current form in 560 and, according to legend, is said to house the bones of St. Catherine. Mount Sinai is due to the transfer of the Ten Commandments to Moses and his encounter with God in the burning bush known.\n\nAn offshoot of this legendary bush is said to still be found near the monastery. In 2002 the Katharinen Kloster was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nAscent and sightseeing: The ascent to the monastery is a bit difficult, so you can book a guided hike at night, for which you will be rewarded with cooler temperatures and a breathtaking sunrise. If the hike is too strenuous for you, you can also ride a camel. After a break, you will visit the monastery together as a group.\n\nThere are some providers for these tours, but when planning your excursion, keep in mind the current travel warning for Egypt issued by the Foreign Office. This currently advises against trips away from the coastal strip such as to Mount Sinai and the St. Catherine’s Monastery.\n\nInfo & Tips:\n\nLocation: Qesm Sharm Ash Sheikh, Janub Sina, Egypt\n\nDistance from Cairo: approx. 450 km\n\nDistance from Hurghada: approx. 310 km (car + ferry)\n\nDistance from Sharm El Sheik: approx. 210 km\n\nDistance from Marsa Alam: approx. 980 km (car + ferry)"
