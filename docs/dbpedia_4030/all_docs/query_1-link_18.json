Christianity is one of the main religions that left a mark on the land of Egypt. This mark manifests mainly in the churches built around Egypt.\n\nCoptic Cairo hosts a large number of beautiful historic churches. Located within and around what was historically known as the Babylon fortress, Coptic Cairo was built around 525 BC. The compound contains many churches, a Jewish synagogue, and the Coptic museum. The area was settled in the 6th century by the Persians, who built the fortress. After the Romans took over Egypt, they fortified the stronghold to stand against invaders.\n\nIt is known in Christian history that the holy family fled to Egypt, escaping King Herod, who wanted to kill Jesus Christ. It's believed that they took shelter in a cave on their journey. This cave later was turned into a church known now as Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga).\n\nAttractions of Coptic Cairo, a part of Old Cairo\n\nThe Hanging Church\n\nThe Hanging Church is the most famous Coptic Church in Egypt.
