        "text": "St. George Catholic Church traces its beginnings to a small wooden chapel sitting off a remote country road over 100 years ago. The chapel was built on land donated in 1885 by the widow of George Kleinpeter. The exact date the chapel was built is unknown, but St. George is listed as a chapel and school in the church directories of the Archdiocese of New Orleans by 1891.\n\nAt the time, St. George was a mission of St. Joseph Church in Baton Rouge. Prior to the building of the chapel, this small community was served by priests from St. Joseph who arrived once a month to celebrate Mass in one of the area homes.\n\nSoon the parishioners of St. George petitioned for their own priest, and so Father Alex Chasles of St. Joseph was assigned to St. George in 1907. However, it wasnâ€™t until the following year that the church directories first list St. George as a parish with a resident priest. At this point, Father Chasles was no longer the resident priest but had been replaced by Father P.C. Cambiaire.\n\nThe early priests of St. George endured many hardships. There was no running water and they hunted and grew their own vegetables in order to feed themselves. Over time, the small wooden chapel was enlarged to accommodate the growing congregation. Early parishioners remember that the chapel was cooled by breezes blowing through the open windows and there were often birds chirping on the sills. They even remember an occasional chicken strutting down the aisle.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, many changes took place in the parish, including the purchase of 19 additional adjoining acres. A new temporary church was built and the present school program began in 1960. Eventually, the temporary church was remodeled and became the primary place of worship in 1988.\n\nThe new St. George Church opened its doors in March 2017. The church was designed by Grace Hebert Architects and built by Milton J. Womack, Inc. The Church is a cruciform shape with a long nave and the cross formed by the left and right transpets. The body of the church is a series of related sections with each part contributing to the unity of the space by proportion, size, and shape. WIth a seating capacity of 1,200 the church features elements of Gothic architecture. Gotchic artchitecture originated in borthern France and spread throughout Europe between the 12th and 16th centuries. The artistic themes of wood, stone, glass and tiling were carefully integrated into the design. Wood beams highlight the arched ceiling reaching 55 feet.\n\nWith over a hundred years of history, St. George is steeped in tradition and looks forward to continuing its good work."
