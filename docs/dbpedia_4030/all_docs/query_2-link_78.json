        "text": "During this study, the principal aim carried out was to obtain more information about technique and conservation conditions of the Egyptian wall paintings during the Roman period in the funerary house in necropolis of Tuna el-Gabal, El-Minia-Upper Egypt. It's going back to 2 nd century AD and involves different sites of Ptolemaic and Roman chapels; some are in the immaculate established style while others are a blend of Pharaonic-Greek style and both are secured with mural painting. Deterioration problems observed on the wall paintings of the funerary house are, loss of plaster layers, disintegration of plaster layers, loss of paint layers (blistering and peeling), discoloration and severely damaged owing to a lot of deterioration factors as weakness of mud brick support, deterioration of surface treatments and to the widespread presence of different salts. The materials used in the painting, preparation layers and the state of conservation of the mural painting at funerary house were investigated by integrated physio-chemical measurements, particularly micro-Raman spectroscopy (ÂµRaman), light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDX), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). In addition, the morphology of multilayer plaster from wall painting was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). A wide color palette utilized as a part of the necropolis has been identified with mineral pigments and pigment mixtures. It is found that, the paints were based on an organic binder and traditional pigments (azurite, hematite, ochre, vegetable black) were used as colorants on plaster. The examination demonstrated that the preparatory layer is verging on made of pure lime while the plaster layer based mainly of lime and gypsum with variable amounts of quartz. The obtained results provided information about the painting technique, chemical\n\nIn the present study, a comprehensive investigation has been undertaken into mural paintings dating to the 19th century and painted by Italian students. They were initially located in El Sakakeny Palace in El Sakakeny Square in Egypt. The analytical instruments used for investigation were optical microscopy ,Scanning Electron Microscopy with EDX, X-Ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared coupled with Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) The analysis revealed that the pigments used in the mural paintings were hematite, litharge, zincate, gold, Goethite(brown ochre)and malachite. The original ground layer comprises zincate with gypsum, The medium used in panting is animal glue and the support is lime stone covered with ground layer from quartz, lime and gypsum.\n\nThe present research was carried out to obtain more information on materials and painting techniques used in Egyptian wall paintings during the 19th century. The Hawsh al-Basha courtyard, dating back to Mohammed Ali&#39;s family period (1805-1952,) was studied for this purpose. The obtained results will be used to set up a scientific plan for restoration and preservation. Pigments, including white zincite, earth green, blue synthetic ultramarine, yellow massicot, black a mixture of magnetite & graphite, brownish red lead and brass were identified. The binding medium in the painting was identified as animal glue. Two preparation layers were identified: the inner coarse ground layer, composed of gypsum as a major component, with calcite and small amounts of quartz and the outer, fine ground layer, composed of calcite only. Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis (SEM-EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform In...\n\nThe first layer of rough coating, applied on the wall support of limestone, is a mortar composed of a mixture of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) and coarse sand. The second layer consists of zincate and gypsum. The third layer is the pictorial layer, made of pigments, the medium being applied in several coatings with a brush [2]. In this study, three mural paintings were fully investigated. Besides gaining technical information about this type of painting, the purpose of this research was to acquire knowledge about both the organic and inorganic materials used. The study comprised the examination of the pigments, media and ground layer [3].\n\nIn this study the surfaces and cross sections of deteriorated Coptic mural paintings were investigated using Computer Tomography (CT) scan images and video, and points (voids) on the surface were analyzed. To our knowledge, it is the first report on the application of CT scan for the investigation of deteriorated Coptic mural painting surfaces in Upper Egypt. The samples tested were collected from two sites: the Monastery of Martyrs (Deir alShuhada-Esna) and the Luxor temple. The selection of these monasteries was due to their historical importance, which is directly related to Egyptian Coptic heritage. The deteriorated surfaces of the selected mural paintings were characterized using new avenues of computed X-ray tomography (CT scan) in order to gather sufficient information about their composition and structure. The obtained results show that CT scan images provided us with detailed information about the sample porosity and structure. In the case of the Martyrs monastery, it was found that the mural paintings consist of one layer which contains clay minerals (kaolinite, montmorillonite, and illite) in the form of coarse plaster. On the other hand, the Martyrs Monastery showed higher porosity than the Roman Fresco in the Luxor Temple.\n\nIn the present study, a comprehensive investigation has been undertaken into an Egyptian Coptic fresco with geometric decoration and the reasons for its damage. It dates back to the 6th century AD and was initially located in the Saint Apollo monastery south Egypt in Asyut, and currently it is found at the Cop-tic Museum, Cairo. The analytical instruments used for investigation were portable digital microscope, Fourier transforms infrared coupled with attenuated total reflectance FTIR-ATR, scanning electron mi-croscopy with EDX, X-ray diffraction and Optical microscope. The results indicated that the painting was executed in a true fresco technique, which prepared on mud brick support with ground consisting of gypsum with a small percentage of lime, hematite used as red color and carbon used as black color."
