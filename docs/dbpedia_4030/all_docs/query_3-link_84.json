        "text": "St. George’s church in Modbury England is the ancestral baptismal church of our/your heritage, reaching back to the early 1600s where Cornet Robert Stetson was baptized and later left with his new wife Honour Tucker Stetson on their pioneering journey to America around 1636. The church in Modbury has always been part of the original charter when the Stetson Kindred was formed in 1905, and we have been supporting the church with what donations we collect every year through to present day.\n\nRecently the church has been renovated and updated with modern heating and updated flooring, allowing for use as an adaptable space to allow other activities and events to be held in the church aside from weekly services. The church staff and vicar Reverend Matt Rowland have been very kind and grateful to the Kindred for help with fundraising for this project. Visiting Stetsons to Modbury are very happily received and the town knows about our organization, and you might even see a Stetson hat around town occasionally.\n\nIn June of 2023 the television series Time Team had a town-wide event in Modbury England that discovered ancient relics, unearthed archaeological finds and examined historical sites and locations surrounding the history of both the English Civil War and the Stetson Heritage associated with Cornet Robert Stetson and his family in Modbury. The episodes are a fascinating look into the history of our family from the British side at the time of unrest just after Cornet Robert Stetson set sail to America and his relatives remained behind to participate in this ‘Interregnum’ in English history. The president of the Stetson Kindred at the time, Jim Stetson, was invited over to Modbury to participate in the production, and the show is available to watch on YouTube across three episodes of the series:"
