        "text": "Mid-1800s\n\nServices begin to be held in the official residence of the British Consul.\n\n1872\n\nServices temporarily suspended when the Chaplain leaves on account of ill health.\n\n1895\n\nChaplaincy revived thanks to the efforts of the Colonial & Continental Church Society (C&CCS). The new British Consul-General and local British residents form a Building Committee.\n\n1897\n\nThe Committee buys land at Rosellon 250, 100 metres from where the Passeig de Gracia meets Diagonal.\n\n1904\n\nBuilding work begins.\n\n1905\n\nChurch consecrated on 7th May. All the money was raised locally.\n\n1936-1945\n\nSt George’s closes temporarily during the Spanish Civil War and World War II.\n\n1967\n\nThe renamed Commonwealth & Continental Church Society (C&CCS), as patrons, suggest building a new, more modern church complex, which could also house the Chaplain, away from the city centre.\n\n1971\n\nBuilding work begins, thanks to the efforts of Richard Webb and then-Chaplain Harry Wilson, who happened to be a good draughtsman and who designed the stunning stained glass window that occupies one wall of the church.\n\n1972\n\nNew church completed as it stands today. First service held on 10th July.\n\n1973\n\nNew St George’s consecrated on 6th May.\n\n1974\n\nSt George’s pays off all costs incurred and becomes entirely self-supporting, including paying the Chaplain’s stipend, which until then had been covered by C&CCS, now known as the Intercontinental Church Society (ICS).\n\n1992\n\nNew laws passed in Spain give full recognition to all Anglican Chaplaincies in Spain as part of the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe."
