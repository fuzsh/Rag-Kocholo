        "text": "The Journey of the Holy Family in Egypt is an important event in Christian history and Islam as it portrays the refuge of Joseph, Mary the Virgin, and Jesus Christ from the persecution of \"King Herod\" after the warning from an angel to Joseph in a dream about the intention of Herod to kill all the male children in the area so they traveled through so many places in Egypt where they performed many miracles, and later they went back to Palestine after the angel told Joseph in another dream that Herod had died. This great event was mysterious and has been a source of inspiration for believers throughout history for the Christian society and Egyptians. It also fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, who said: \"It will be a sign and witness to the Lord Almighty in the land of Egypt\".\n\nWhen they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. The Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the Lord on that day and worship with sacrifice and offering. The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them. The main goal of the article is to provide a comprehensive guide to the places in Egypt that are believed to have been visited by the Holy Family during their stay in Egypt. Through our meticulous research, Trips In Egypt Team will take our readers on an amazing journey through time to allow them to connect with the profound spirituality of these sacred places.\n\nWhat Was the Reason Behind the Journey of the Holy Family to Egypt?\n\nA group of wise men presented Jesus over 2000 years ago as a prophet chosen by God and destined to become the ruler prophet of the Jews during this period. This remark alarmed \"King Herod\" who tried to put an end to this budding menace. Fearing for their life, the Holy Family set out on a perilous trek from Bethlehem to Egypt. So, their journey began in the northern areas of Sinai and led them to the village of Farama, each place where the Holy Family took sanctuary, which was later consecrated with churches and monasteries. Tel Basta was the next stop on their journey where Jesus blessed the area, as it caused a miraculous spring to come out from the soil. Their way brought them to the sacred lands of the Valley of Natroun which is located in the western desert of Egypt. The Valley of Natroun later became famous as the earthly birthplace of monasticism, and the Christian people dedicated themselves to worship.\n\nThe Holy Family traveled to Matariyah and Ain Shams neighborhoods of Cairo where Jesus blessed a water well. Virgin Mary washed Jesus' garment and emptied the water on the ground, which resulted in a balsam tree blossoming, and it was later used for holy Myron. They went to old Cairo and sought sanctuary in a cave that is known today as the Abu Serga Church within the fortress of Babylon, this site later became a worldwide pilgrimage site. The next destination of the family was Al Maadi where they constructed the Church of the Virgin Maryin Maadi along the Nile River before sailing south on the Nile.\n\nThe Holy Family traveled later to Minya where they crossed the Nile River from the west bank to the city \"Assiut\" and stayed for six months. After three years in Egypt, the Holy Family retraced their paths and went back to Palestine when they heard that King Herod had died. They visited Assiut again where the Christians greeted them with joy, they also stopped by Matareya, where a spring had sprung up when Mary washed Jesus' clothes. The spring still flows today and is revered by many pilgrims.\n\nWhere Did the Holy Family Stay in Egypt?\n\nThe journey of the Holy Family in Egypt has great importance for both Christians and Muslims as it is a symbol of divine protection and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. The Holy family traveled across the country from the Nile Delta to Upper Egypt, and they stayed in many places that became sacred sites for Christians and Muslims. These places include churches, monasteries, caves, wells, and springs that still attract tourists who want to follow the path of the Holy Family.\n\n1. Bethlehem\n\nBethlehem is an iconic pilgrimage site that began with the journey of the Holy Family who fled to Egypt from \"Herod\". Bethlehem is a town of great religious significance, and it lies six miles south of Jerusalem. This amazing destination is where the famous king \"David\" was born, and where Jesus Christ was also born. They left their home in Nazareth, where they had lived quietly, to go to Bethlehem, where they had to register for the census ordered by the Roman emperor.\n\nThe Holy family faced many difficulties along the way, such as the Samaritans, the cold nights, the hungry wolves, and the greedy robbers; however, they did not know what awaited them in Bethlehem, whether they would find a place to rest or not. They only knew that God was with them and that he had a plan for their child. The journey took them about four or five days, and they had to walk most of the way or ride on a donkey. Finally, they arrived in Bethlehem at night, and they had hoped to find a house where they could stay, but there was no place for them except a stable.\n\n2. The Sinai Desert at Rafah\n\nThe journey of the Holy family continued when they reached the northeastern edge of Egypt, \"Near Rafah City\". This was an important event that marked the start of their refuge in the Sinai Desert. The first place that the Holy Family visited in Egypt was Rafah, which is a town on the border with Palestine. Here, they saw the power that saved them from the thirst of the desert and the anger of the people.\n\nThe Holy Family crossed the border under the cover of darkness, and they followed an angel who showed them a secure place; it was a vital point that controlled the warfare between Egypt and Palestine. They proceeded with their journey through Sinai and arrived at Tell al-Farama, where they saw a statue of Isis and Osiris.\n\n3. The Journey through Mariamiah\n\nThe Holy Family traveled through Sheikh Zouaid in Arish and Baloza city which is now called \"Farama\". They arrived at Tell al-Farama, where they drank from a spring of sweet water and ate from a palm tree. They also prayed at the ruins of a temple that was dedicated to Horus who was the god of the sky. The only green thing in these lands was a grass called \"Mariamiah\" which looked like green tea. Mariamiah was very important as the people say that the Virgin Mary ate this grass when she was in these places.\n\nThe Holy Family departed from Mariamiah after half a year, went to the south, and left behind a blessing and a promise that whoever visits this place will receive grace and healing from God. The monks kept the memory of their visit and passed it on to the next generations from all over the world. There is an amazing monastery that is still standing today as one of the oldest and holiest places in Egypt.\n\n4. The Mount of Churches\n\nThe Holy Family continued their journey in the Sinai Desert until they arrived near \"Farma\" where an old fortress and some pillars remain to the day and age. There is also a memory of the monastery of St. Virgin Mary and St. Isidoros El-Farmy among these ruins. This area is known as \"The Mount of Churches\" because of its religious importance and a great place where the Holy Family found consolation during their journey to Egypt.\n\nIt is said that a series of miraculous events occurred at the Mount of Churches as legends tell of a spring that appeared to provide water for the Holy Family during their stay.\n\n5. Tel Basta\n\nTel Basta is located 81 kilometers northeast of Cairo in the governorate of Sharqiah, which is a great destination in the journey of the Holy Family to seek refuge and safety. Jesus showed his divine power by making a spring of water appear from the earth, and by destroying the statues of the pagan goddess Bastet. Tel Basta was also called Bubastis, and it was a sacred city for the ancient Egyptians who worshipped Bastet, the cat goddess.\n\nNow, Tel Basta is a field of ruins with a cat cemetery and mummified museum that demonstrates objects from the old and Coptic times. The journey of the Holy Family Tel Basta is one of the many stops that the Holy Family made in Egypt, there are many churches and monasteries that honor these places, and some of them have icons related to the Holy Family. This miracle remains important for the Holy Family in Egypt, and it still attracts pilgrims to Tel Basta.\n\n6. The Holy Family in the Town of Mostorod\n\nMostorod (which was known as Al-Mahama) is located about 10 kilometers from Cairo. Al-Mahama means \"The Bathing Place\" and has got its name from the deed of the Virgin Mary of washing the Christ Child there. The Holy Family had visited Mostorod, where their presence caused a spring that still flows to this day and age.\n\nJesus made this spring of 18 springs that he dug in Egypt during his journey and some of many of them still exist today which is unbelievable. Many people come to visit the town of Mostorod at the feast of Mary the Virgin.\n\n7. The Holy Family at the Town of Belbeis\n\nThe Holy Family left Mostorod and headed northeast to Belbeis, a town in the Sharquia governorate. In Belbeis, the Holy Family rested under a large tree known as \"The Tree of Mariam\", and they enjoyed the peace and prayed to God. According to some stories, the Virgin Mary hung the clothes of the Christ Child on the branches of the tree after washing them. As soon as the Holy Family came near, the statues of the goddess broke and fell to the ground as a sign of the power and presence of Jesus Christ. The Egyptians of Belbeis were amazed by this event.\n\nThe Holy Family did not stay long in Belbeis, as they continued their journey towards other places in Egypt, and they left behind a legacy of faith for the people of Belbeis who later became Christians and built a church in honor of the Virgin Mary and her connection with this place. Many people still visit Belbeis to pray and honor the Holy Family and their journey in Egypt.\n\n8. The Town of Samanoud\n\nThe Church of the \"Virgin Mary\" and \"St. Abanoub El Neheisy\" are historical treasures in Samanud that lie in the governorate of Gharbeya. The diocese of Mehalla El-Kobra oversees this sacred place as it is an important area in history due to the visit of the Holy Family who traveled through the northern parts of Egypt. The people of Samanud received them with great joy, and Jesus performed a miracle by giving life to a dead person. The Holy Family stayed in Samanud for a long time.\n\nA woman from the city of Samanud gave the Virgin Mary a stone bowl for kneading dough, and the Virgin Mary used this bowl to make bread for the Holy Family; this amazing bowl is still preserved in a glass case in the church courtyard. Next to this holy place, there is a spring from which the Holy Family drank water. The water from this spring is still poured into the old bowl, and it blesses everyone who visits this holy site. Samanud has also witnessed the journey of the Holy Family, which is a place of faith and miracles and one of the stops of the Holy Family in Egypt. The town of Samanoud also hosts a yearly celebration that remembers the visit of the Holy Family and draws many visitors from different parts of Egypt and the world.\n\n9. The City of Sakha\n\nSakha is a city in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate near the Mediterranean Sea, and it was an important stop for the Holy Family on their journey from Samannud. The Coptic name of the city is \"Bikha Isos\" which means in the old language \"The Foot of Jesus\" because he was here and he left his footprint on a rock, which is still kept in a glass case in the Church. The rock is also said to offer healing, and many people touch it and ask for grace.\n\nThe rock also has the words \"God is One\" written below it. There is also a well that miraculously sprang from the rock, and it provided water for the Holy Family. The city also had a monastery called “Deir El Maghtas” which was destroyed in the 13th century and replaced by a lasting church.\n\n10. Wadi El-Natroun\n\nThe Holy Family traveled westward from Sakha to the Natroun Valley in the Beheira governorate. This valley is 60 kilometers long and 12 kilometers wide and was called \"Sokhty Hamam\" or \"Wady El-Malh\" in Arabic which means \"The Valley of Salt\" because of its salty lakes used by the pharaohs for mummification. The Holy Family suffered from thirst in this desert area, so Jesus Christ performed a miracle and created a freshwater well that is now called \"The Source of Mariam\". The Holy Family drank and rested in Wadi El-Natroun. This also becomes useful for healing diseases like psoriasis.\n\nThe Natroun Valley also saw the birth of monasticism in 330 AD under St. Makaire the Great. St. Makaire lived in a cave in the western part of the valley where the Baramos Monastery was founded by Saint Domadios and Saint Maximos who were the sons of a Roman King. As more monks joined the Monastery, St. Makarios left Baramos Monastery and built the Monastery of Anba Makar in the Eastern part of the Natroun Valley. Later, this monastery became famous as it had more than 15 Coptic Church patriarchs coming from it. Baramos Monastery also gained fame in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThere are two other important monasteries were built between Anba Makar and Baramos Monastery “St. Bishoy Monastery” which was established in the 5th century by St. Bishoy, and St. Virgin Mary El-Sourian Monastery which was built in the 6th century near the cave of Bishoy for prayer. This cave still exists today next to the main church of the Sourian Monastery. The last Monastery was founded after the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD and is called the Monastery Surian because of the presence of Syriac Orthodox monks.\n\nThe desert of Shihit in the Natroun Valley was famous for the teachings of monastic. This place attracted monks from different countries and different people who wanted to learn monasticism according to the old traditions of monks. Monasteries like the Saurians, Ethiopians, Armenians, and Nubians had a great role in this desert. The Saurians Monastery was known for its hermits, monks, and a large library containing ancient manuscripts in many languages, such as Coptic, Arabic, Syriac, Greek, English, French, and Ethiopian.\n\nThe Pope of the Coptic Church, SS Pope Shenouda III came from the Sourians Monastery and raised the reputation of the church worldwide with his deep knowledge. Many bishops were well-educated and had wisdom and also originated from this monastery in Wadi El-Natroun.\n\n11. El-Matarieh and Ain Shams\n\nWhen the Holy Family traveled to Cairo, they visited Matariyah and Ain Shams, where another miracle happened. In Ain Shams, Jesus blessed a well with holy water and his mother Mary washed his clothes there. The Virgin Mary also poured some of the water on the ground, and a balsam tree sprouted from it. This tree was later used to make the holy Myron oil.\n\nThe Holy Family continued their journey and reached Old Cairo where they hid in a cave. This cave became the famous church of Abu Serja, which lies inside the walls of the Babylon fortress. This place became a holy site for pilgrims from all over the world who came to see where the Holy Family stayed. These places where the Holy Family went in Matariyah, Ain Shams, and Old Cairo are still important for faith, and many people visit them today.\n\n12. El-Zeitoun\n\nAfter leaving Matarieh, the Holy Family continued their journey in Egypt and rested for a while in the area of Zeitoun. This place became the site of a miraculous event on April 2, 1968, when the Church of the Virgin Mary on Toman Bay Street witnessed the appearance of the Virgin Mary. This was not a one-time occurrence, but a series of visions that lasted for a year and attracted hundreds of thousands of people from different religions.\n\nThe church gained worldwide fame and recognition because of the appearance of Mary which it still enjoys today. The Coptic Church celebrated the 50th anniversary of this unbelievable phenomenon in 2018 with a grand ceremony in honor of the Virgin Mary.\n\n13. Haret Zoueila\n\nThe Holy Family came to Haret Zoueila in the 4th century in Egypt which is a place of great spiritual importance and drank from a well that still exists today. A Coptic man named \"Hakim Zeilon\" obeyed the command of God and built an old church that was the home of the popes for more than 300 years and had two monasteries next to it for the Virgin Mary and St. George.\n\nThe faithful sisters in this monastery follow the example of the Virgin Mary, and they are living in worship and the love of God in the same place that was graced by the presence of Mary the Virgin.\n\n14. Ezbawia\n\nThe Holy Family left Haret Zoueila and headed to Old Cairo, and they crossed Ezbakiah. This home was where nine church leaders lived for more than a century and a half. This place shows how much the Holy Family blessed it when they were there. Near the Cathedral of St. Mark, there is a place that used to be farmland when the Holy Family came here. There was a big garden with fruit trees, and at the entrance of Ezbaweya, there was a well, called the “Well of Ste. Virgin Mary” where the Holy Family drank water.\n\nThis place has a wonderful miracle because the Holy Family met an Egyptian farmer who was planting watermelon seeds. The farmer talked to the Virgin Mary, and she told him that the seeds would grow into ripe watermelons overnight. That is what happened, and when the soldiers of “Herod” came looking for the Holy Family, the farmer told them about them and the watermelons. This confused them, and they could not find the Holy Family. This is how the Holy Family traveled through these old places, and their visit made those lands sacred.\n\n15. Abu Serga Church\n\nThe Holy Family found shelter in a refuge under the Fortress of Babylon in Old Cairo where they lived for three months. This refuge became a church over time, and a bigger church was built over it later. This sacred place of worship is called “the Church of Abu Serga” and was named after Saints Sergeos and Bacchus. The Church of Abu Serga is famous worldwide and attracts tourists who want to be blessed at the place where the Holy Family stayed. Inside Abu Serga, there is an old well that the Holy Family used to drink from, and there is also a deep pool that relates to the history of Christianity. To celebrate the Epiphany, churches made large holes at their entrances filled with water. Abu Serga Church is one of the oldest churches.\n\nNext to Abu Serga Church, there is another church from the same time called \"The Hanging Church\". This church got its name from being built on more than a tower of the old Roman fortress of Babylon. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and has historical importance. There is also the Coptic Museum, which was founded by Séméka Pasha, a Christian who loved Coptic history. Abu Serga Church celebrates the arrival of Christianity in Egypt on the 24th of the Coptic month, ‘Bashans’.\n\n16. The Church of the Virgin Mary in Maadi\n\nThe place where the Holy Family stayed in the \"Maadi\" district is a historical site that connects to the religious past. Maadi was an important stop for the Holy Family as they crossed the Nile River from here to go to Upper Egypt. The church was built to remember their visit, and it was called \"The Church of the Blessed Virgin\", Maadiya, which means who crossed, and The Holy Family left “Maadi” by boat to continue their journey. The whole area was later named ‘Maadi’ after this great event. There was also a monastery here, called “The Monastery of the Blessed Virgin El-Adwiya” where monks lived, but when the city expanded, the monks moved to the desert for more peace. The monastery then became a church that serves the local people who worship there. In the courtyard of the church of the Virgin Mary, there is a special place, a hole that leads to stairs going down to the Nile, and this is where the Holy Family got on the boat.\n\nSome religious people saw a miraculous thing at this church after the Holy Mass on March 12, 1976. A Holy Bible was floating on the Nile water, and it moved towards the door of the church. The Book stopped before the stairs that lead to the church, and the people picked it up. They were surprised to see that it was open to the Book of Isaiah, chapter 19 which says “The prophecy against Egypt: See, the Lord rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.\" Isaiah 19:1 (NIV) and \"The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.\" Isaiah 19:25 (NIV)\n\nIn the church, a glass hut shelters the Holy Bible, which has been left open on this page for ages. The Church has guarded it with care as a witness to the journey of the Holy Family to this blessed land through Egypt.\n\nThese verses highlight the presence and power of the Lord in Egypt and the blessings bestowed upon the people.\n\n17.

The Holy Family lived in this mountainous area for some time. Mount Qosqam is therefore a revered place of spirituality, believed to be one of the spots where the Holy Family found refuge in Egypt.\n\nThe stay of the Holy Family in Mount Qosqam reflects the historical and religious legacy of the place. They are said to have inhabited a cave at the base of the mountain; this cave, called the \"Holy Family Cave\" is now a holy site of pilgrimage for Christians.\n\nThe Muharraq monastery is a great site in terms of history, architecture, and spirituality.

Mary the Virgin Mother held Jesus in her arms when the Holy Family entered Egypt, with Joseph at her side and Salome accompanying them. The feast also celebrates the connection between Egypt and Christianity. This is a great festival that honors the historical event of Jesus' coming to the land of Egypt. The church remembers this event every year as it shows the spiritual bond between the journey of the Holy Family and the Christians of today.\n\nAs a result, the Lord's intention for us is to follow this example, walk in his footsteps, and escape from sin and evil. This getaway is a plan that we should always remember, believe in, think about, and follow. There was also a spiritual purpose for Jesus' entry into Egypt to create a church for the lord in the center of Egypt, as well as to abolish and demolish the pagan temples that had spread across the country and perverted it. So, we can believe that the journey of the Holy Family to Egypt is a journey with an important goal aimed at establishing the Temple of God in Egypt.\n\nBiblical Connection and the Role of Egypt in Early Christianity\n\nThe Holy Bible demonstrates the connection between Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and Egypt, and the role of Egypt as the most direct connection is in the Gospel of Matthew, where Joseph is warned in a dream to take Jesus and Mary to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of infants.\n\nMatthew 2:13-15 (NIV): \"When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. ‘Get up,' he said, 'take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.' So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son'.\n\nExplanation: This passage highlights the connection between Jesus, Mary, and Joseph with Egypt. Joseph is instructed by an angel to take his family to Egypt to escape King Herod's threat. This event fulfills the prophecy from the Old Testament (Hosea 11:1) that emphasizes that just as God called the nation of Israel out of Egypt, He also called His Son, Jesus, out of Egypt, underscoring the parallel between Jesus and the history of God's people.\n\nAfter Herod's death, the Holy Family returned from Egypt.\n\nMatthew 2:19-21 (NIV): \"After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead.' So he got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.\"\n\nExplanation: This passage solidifies the connection between Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and Egypt, and it recounts their return from Egypt to the land of Israel after King Herod's death. The Holy Family's time in Egypt is a significant part of Jesus' early life. These events were seen as the fulfillment of a prophecy in the Old Testament.\n\nEgypt Travel Packages for a Spiritual Awakening"
