St. George's Church (Mar gergis church old Coptic Cairo ) or Hanging church in old Cairo.

According to Wikipedia: Saint Virgin Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church also known as the Hanging Church (El Muallaqa) is one of the oldest churches in Egypt and the history of a church on this site dates to the 3rd century AD.

The Hanging (The Suspended) Church is named for its location above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, the Roman fortress in Coptic Cairo (Old Cairo); its nave is suspended over a passage.

The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it "the Staircase Church. The land surface has risen by some six meters since the Roman period, so that the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position.

The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.
