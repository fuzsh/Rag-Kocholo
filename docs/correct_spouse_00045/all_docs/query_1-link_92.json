She was the 9th child born to Lowell and Grace Sanders Jones. She was the youngest girl and was nick named “Bodie” by her brother Jim Boy because of her pretty bow legs.\n\nShe attended George Washington Carver School #87 from Kindergarten through the 8th grade. She loved her school and the neighborhood that she grew up in. Life long friendships were formed on 87’s playground. She would many years later organize a reunion committee to celebrate the neighborhood and School #87. The yearly reunions lasted for more than 20 years. It was at #87 that she developed a love for classical music.\n\nBoldie loved the Lord. She grew up in a devout, faith believing home. She attended Grace Apostolic Church Sunday School as a child. What many may not know was that she also attended 25th St. Baptist church Sunshine Band, BTU and Vacation Bible School. She said that it was the “snacks” that made her go. She received the “Holy Ghost” at Grace in December 1965 and dedicated her life to God. She sang with the Indianapolis Pentecostal Mass Choir and taught Sunday school. Unfortunately however she had to give up her cheer leading and dreams of becoming a dancer because of the then rigid church rules.\n\nShe married in 1968 and although this marriage was later dissolved she was gifted with her greatest treasure. Her darling son, Thomas Keith who she affectionately called “Tokie”. She was a great mother. She taught him just as she had been taught to believe in God and to love the word of God. Tokie remembered all of the scriptures that he had learned. He took special pride in Genesis 1:28 that read “and God said to them, be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth.” And he did his best blessing her with grandchildren, Amira, Deante, Shamyr, Thomas Keith, Thomys Keith, Tyler Keith, Thomari Keith, Trevon Keith and Christian.\n\nBoldie loved working with children. She was employed at Fahondzi Day care, Noble Center and the Indiana School for the Deaf. She taught herself American sign language so that she could communicate with her students. As she grew stronger in this form of expression she began to experiment with signing songs to music. This was a perfect way for her to pick back up her love for dance. She could use her hands to express in a dramatic fashion the lyrics of the song in a rhythmic sway using American Sign language, which was no different than a operatic diva performing an aria in latin.\n\nBoldie met Frederick Walker in 2014. They were a perfect match! He would become her husband in 2017. The two of them decided to move to Murfreesboro Tennessee. It was their “Shangrilai” They spent 6 wonderful years together.

They were met not only with a wonderful, caring, dynamic Pastor but a church full of friends.\n\nOn Sunday August 20th Boldie joined her Mother, Father, Buddy, Bonnie, Sylvia, Jim Boy, Tootsie, Adrian, Pre Bug, Buddy Stew and Tee in eternity.
