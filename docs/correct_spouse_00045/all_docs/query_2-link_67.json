        "text": "University of Kansas announces fall 2023 honor roll\n\nTue, 02/13/2024\n\nauthor\n\nChristy Little Schock\n\nShare\n\nLAWRENCE — More than 8,000 undergraduate students at the University of Kansas earned honor roll distinction for the fall 2023 semester.\n\nThe honor roll comprises undergraduates who meet requirements in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences and in the schools of Architecture & Design, Business, Education & Human Sciences, Engineering, Health Professions, Journalism & Mass Communications, Music, Nursing, Pharmacy, Professional Studies and Social Welfare.\n\nHonor roll criteria vary among the university’s academic units. Some schools honor the top 10% of students enrolled, some establish a minimum grade-point average, and others raise the minimum GPA for each year students are in school. Students must complete a minimum number of credit hours to be considered for the honor roll.\n\nFall 2023 honorees are below and include students whose honor roll status was conferred before Jan. 31. Students who believe their names were mistakenly omitted should directly contact their academic advisers. Not all students opt to have their names published.
