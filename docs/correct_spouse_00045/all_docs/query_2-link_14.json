        "text": "Natalie Mendoza, a versatile actress and model, has captivated audiences with her performances on stage, television, and the big screen. Born in Hong Kong on August 12, 1978, and raised in Sydney, Australia, Mendoza’s career took off with her roles in musicals such as ‘Miss Saigon’ and ‘Cats the Musical.’ She made her television debut in 1998 with an episode of ‘Wildside’ and her first movie role as Tran in the 2000 film ‘Muggers.’ Today, she is best known for her portrayal of Jackie Clunes in the British television drama series ‘Hotel Babylon’ and Juno in the horror thrillers ‘The Descent’ and ‘The Descent 2.’ Here are five lesser-known facts about the multifaceted talent that is Natalie Mendoza.\n\n1. A Blossoming Talent from a Creative Family\n\nNatalie Mendoza hails from a large and artistically gifted family, which undoubtedly influenced her decision to pursue a career in the performing arts. Her mother, an Australian dancer and television personality, has German and English roots, while her father, a jazz pianist and arranger, is of Spanish, Filipino, and Chinese descent. Mendoza is one of six siblings, all of whom have careers in various aspects of the performing arts.\n\n2. The Birth of the Band ‘Jackson Mendoza’\n\nNatalie Mendoza’s talents extend beyond acting, as she is also a gifted singer. In 1998, she and her sister Rebecca Jackson Mendoza formed a band called ‘Jackson Mendoza.’ The duo signed with Virgin Records and released two singles, one of which reached number one on the Australian charts, while the other peaked in the top ten. The band disbanded in 2000, leaving behind their singles ‘Venus or Mars’ (released in October 1999) and ‘Ordinary Girl’ (released in August 2000).\n\n3. An Unexpected Exit from ‘Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark’\n\nNatalie Mendoza was cast as Arachne in the musical ‘Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,’ based on a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, with music and lyrics by U2’s Bono and The Edge. Unfortunately, Mendoza was forced to leave the show due to a work-related injury that occurred backstage, after appearing in only a few preview performances.\n\n4. The Face of ‘Voodoo Dolls’\n\nAlthough primarily known for her acting roles, Natalie Mendoza has dabbled in various other projects throughout her career, including modeling. In 2003, she became the face of ‘Voodoo Dolls,’ an apparel clothing brand popular in both England and Australia. Founded in Bondi Beach, the company offers sportswear and streetwear and was the first surfing brand to design a range of clothing in this style exclusively for women.\n\n5. A Marriage to Eliot Kennedy\n\nNatalie Mendoza married record producer and songwriter Eliot Kennedy in April 2006, but the couple divorced in 2010. Based in Sheffield, England, Kennedy has worked with a variety of artists, including the Spice Girls, The Wanted, Delta Goodrem, Bryan Adams, S Club 7, and Lulu.\n\nSave"
