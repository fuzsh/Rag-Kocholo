        "text": "Charlize is a snob...\n\nWilson Pickett has passed away...\n\nEven Scar's mum thinks she should put her boobs away...\n\nAussie Idol engaged...\n\nThat 70's gay love...\n\n50 has announced his retirement, but not until he has released two more records unfortunatly...\n\nPlus the world's first black Jesus film...\n\nHER smile couldn't have been any brighter at the Golden Globe Awards earlier this week, but Hollywood hottie Charlize Theron gave an Oscar-winning temper tantrum when the cameras captured her in Sydney yesterday.\n\nFor someone so accustomed to posing and pouting, South African stunner Theron was surprisingly surly when she was spotted in the Rocks yesterday.\n\nIn town for Monday night's star-studded premiere of her latest flick North Country, Theron went to extraordinary lengths to avoid having her snap taken after arriving in Sydney earlier in the morning.\n\nAfter trying to take cover behind her entourage, which included her mother Gerda, Theron shielded her face with her bags and jackets before jumping into a cab, a lit cigarette in hand.\n\nOn arrival at the domestic terminal, where the star was believed to be farewelling her mother, Theron - using her bags as a protective cover - attempted to ram our photographer as he tried to get a quick photo.\n\nShe then made a mad dash for a restricted access area of the terminal, all the while covering her usually smiling face with a jacket and bag.\n\nConfidential hope Sydney A-listers Michael Caton, Daniel MacPherson, Peter Phelps and Holly Brisley will be subjected to better behaviour from the North Country star when she hits the red carpet for Monday night's State Theatre premiere.\n\nTheron will head to Melbourne next Tuesday, before travelling to New Zealand to open the film with it's Kiwi director, Niki Caro.\n\nVETERAN soul singer Wilson Pickett, known for such hits as Mustang Sally and In the Midnight Hour, has died of a heart attack near his home in Virginia. He was 64.\n\n\"He was in hospital very near his home in Virginia,\" his manager Margo Lewis said.\n\n\"He'd been ill for a while and was forced in 2005 to take a hiatus from performing,\" Ms Lewis said.\n\nBorn on March 18th, 1941 in Prattville, Alabama, Pickett moved with his family as a sixteen year-old to Detroit where he joined the gospel-soul group The Violinaires. In 1961 he joined the established soul group The Falcons, penning their 1962 hit I Found Love.\n\nDeciding to branch out, Pickett went solo and signed with independent Double L Records, where he wrote and recorded If You Love Me and It's Too Late, a tune covered and made a hit by Solomon Burke.\n\nIt was on this tune that Pickett rapped about 'the midnight hour', a closing line to the song that Stax records guitar legend Steve Cropper adopted for Pickett's first smash hit.\n\nJerry Wexler, the legendary executive and producer with Atlantic records, took Pickett with him to Memphis, home to the soul label Stax and paired him with Booker T and the MGs, with whom Pickett would record his biggest hits.\n\n1965 saw the partnership first bear fruit, with the monster hit \"In the Midnight Hour\" launching Pickett as a world wide star. The original rhythm of the song was adapted, according to MGs guitarist Steve Cropper, to match a dance popular with teens at the time called \"the jerk\" and so got its trademark syncopated beat.\n\nPickett co-wrote the tune with MGs guitarist Steve Cropper in about an hour, and it spent a week atop the R&B singles chart in August of 1965.\n\nPickett toured Australia in 2003, double-billed with Max Merritt and Meteors as part of a rock revival tour. An earlier tour in the 1990s saw Pickett play to small crowds on a tour inspired by the success of the film The Commitments, which featured his music. With a small band lacking the precision of his Stax ensembles, Pickett's shows were forgettable affairs.\n\nPromoter Michael Chugg who brought Pickett out for the 2003 tour, recalled the artist as a 'perfectionist', who halted his band's performance during the Melbourne show of that tour to berate band members for not keeping up with him.\n\n\"I brought him back past his best, but some nights he was unbelievable,\" said Chugg today. \"Pickett for so many people in Australia was their first touch of black music, he was a great artist who turned a lot of young white people onto his music in the 60s.\"\n\nWilson Pickett appeared with fellow soul legends Eddie Floyd and Johnny Lang appear in the 1998 movie Blues Brothers 2000, where they performed 634-5789.\n\nWilson Pickett's son Michael said of his father \"He did his part. It was a great ride, a great trip, I loved him and I'm sure he was well-loved, and I just hope that he's given his props.\"\n\nSCARLETT Johansson's mother has reprimanded her for revealing too much cleavage at the Golden Globe awards. The stunning actress wore a low-cut red dress to the star-studded event - but her mum, Melanie, says she went too far by showing off her ample breasts. A friend of Scarlett's family is quoted in Britain's Daily Express newspaper as saying: \"She said she looked like a member of the Baywatch cast. Mel feels Scarlett tried a little too hard to show off her figure - to the point where she was almost bursting out of her dress.\" Mum is reportedly going to choose Scarlett's next dress to wear in public.\n\n- From BANG Showbiz\n\nRICKI-LEE announced this morning that she and her boyfriend of four years, Jamie Babbington, recently became engaged and are planning a Spring 2007 wedding. Breathe, the third single from her debut self-titled album entered the ARIA charts this week at No.17. Meanwhile, pop princess turned thespian Natalie Mendoza is engaged to UK music producer Eliot Kennedy. Mendoza, best known for her role in the now defunct power pop duo Jackson Mendoza, will seal the deal on her six-month fairytale romance with Kennedy in Thailand in March.\n\n- With Sydney Confidential\n\nCHRISTOPHER Knight and Barry Williams (pictured), who played brothers Peter and Greg Brady on The Brady Bunch, will play gay lovers on That '70s Show. Knight, 47, and Williams, 51, have already shot the episode, New York's Daily News reports, and word is that the former on-screen siblings may even share a kiss. That '70s Show, meanwhile, will end in May, US network Fox said. Also on the way out is Malcolm in the Middle, which debuted in 2000. It will air its swansong in the US on May 14.\n\n- From MX\n\n50 Cent has announced he is to retire from rap music. The hugely popular hip-hop star says he is planning to call time on his hugely successful career after recording just two more albums. He said: \"I can tell you now you're only gonna get two more albums from me. I'm gonna fulfil my album requirements, with Shady Aftermath records, and then I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.\" 50 - who is currently promoting new movie Get Rich Or Die Tryin', in which he makes his acting debut - says he isn't sure if he wants to pursue an acting career after retiring from music.\n\n- From BANG Showbiz\n\nFromnews.com.au\n\nBilled as the world's first black Jesus film, Son of Man portrays Christ as a modern African revolutionary and aims to shatter the Western image of a placid saviour with fair hair and blue eyes.\n\nThe South African film, which was to premiere on Sunday at the US Sundance festival in Utah, transports the life and death of Christ from first century Palestine to a contemporary African state racked by war and poverty.\n\nFrom smh.com.au"
