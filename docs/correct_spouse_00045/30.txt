Classic Celebrity Quote

"Fearful of not pleasing him - of destroying my image as his little girl - I resigned myself to the long wait. Instead of consummating our love in the usual way, he began teaching me other means of pleasing him. We had a strong connection, much of it sexual. The two of us created a lot of exciting and wild times."
