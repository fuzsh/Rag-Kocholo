Chinese writer Gao Xingjian won the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2000, the Swedish Academy said on Thursday.

Gao won the prize, worth nearly $1 million, for "an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity, which has opened new paths for the Chinese novel and drama," the academy said in its citation.

Gao, 60, is a political refugee and playwright whose works have not been performed in China since his work The Other Shore was banned in 1986, the Swedish Academy said. He left China a year after and lives in Paris, the citation said.

It described him as a novelist, translator, dramatist, director and critic.

Gao is the first Chinese writer to receive the prestigious literature prize.

"In the writing of Gao Xingjian literature is born anew from the struggle of the individual to survive the history of the masses," the academy said in its citation. "He is a perspicacious skeptic who makes no claim to be able to explain the world. He asserts that he has found freedom only in writing."

The literature award  usually the first  was the fifth and last Nobel prize unveiled in Stockholm this week. The Nobel Peace Prize winner will be named Friday in Oslo, Norway

The Nobel Prizes are funded by a trust set up in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Nobel said the literature prize should recognize an author whose work moves in an "ideal direction" without specifying exactly what e meant
