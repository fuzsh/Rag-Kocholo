        "text": "Stockholm - Gao Xingjian, a Chinese dissident playwright and author whose innovative work enraged China's ruling elite and shook the halls of literary convention worldwide, won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.\n\nGao Xingjian, 60, was awarded the prize \"for an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity, which has opened new paths for the Chinese novel and drama,\" the jury said in its citation.\n\nAmong his most well-known works is \"Soul Mountain,\" an impressionistic search for roots, inner peace and liberty through travels in remote parts of southern China, where shamanistic customs linger.\n\n\"Through its polyphony, its blend of genres and the scrutiny that the act of writing subjects itself to, the book recalls German Romanticism's magnificent concept of a universal poetry,\" the citation said.\n\nBorn in Ganzhou in eastern China in 1940, he took French citizenship after settling in Paris in 1988 as a political refugee.\n\nA year later, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, Gao formally quit China's Communist Party.\n\nAfter publishing the play \"Fugitives\", which takes place against the background of that massacre, he was declared persona non grata by the regime and his works were banned.\n\nHe is known mainly for work in Chinese, but has also produced several pieces in French.\n\n\"In the writing of Gao Xingjian, literature is born anew from the struggle of the individual to survive the history of the masses. He is a perspicacious sceptic who makes no claim to be able to explain the world,\" the jury said.\n\nGrowing up in the aftermath of the Japanese invasion, he received a degree in French in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution, from 1966-1976, he was sent to a re-education camp.\n\nAt one point during this time, the citation said, he \"felt obliged to burn a suitcase full of manuscripts.\"\n\nNot until 1979 could he publish his work and travel abroad, heading to France and Italy.\n\nWhile Gao's works were a huge public success, he soon found himself at the centre of controversy.\n\nHis novel \"A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction\", published in 1981, \"gave rise to a violent polemic on 'modernism',\" the Swedish Academy said. And his 1983 absurd drama \"Bus Stop\" was also condemned by Beijing as \"intellectual pollution\".\n\nAccording to the Academy, the play was \"described by one eminent member of the party as the most pernicious piece of writing since the foundation of the People's Republic.\"\n\nGao Xingjian's playwriting influences have included Artaud, Brecht, Beckett and Kantor, but also popular drama. He has also adopted elements from Chinese ancient masked drama, shadow plays and the dancing, singing and drumming traditions.\n\nThe Nobel laureate, contacted at his home in Paris, said he was astonished to have won.\n\n\"I am surprised,\" he said, pointing out that he was not among the favourites. \"Perhaps it was better that way,\" he joked.\n\nGao will take home the prize sum of nine million kronor, or just under one million dollars.\n\nHe will receive the prize, along with the other Nobel laureates, from the hands of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf at the official ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prizes' creator, Swedish scholar and inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nIn China, the state-controlled media was silent over the award, but foreign analysts said it was likely the Chinese authorities would take a dim view of the awarding of the prize to Gao.\n\nLast year, Beijing warned the Nobel Committee against awarding the peace prize to exiled Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng.\n\nSuch an award would be unacceptable and would discredit the prize, Beijing's foreign ministry said at the time.\n\nYa Ding, a Chinese author living in Beijing who writes in French, welcomed the awarding of the literature prize to Gao.\n\n\"I've been predicting this for years. Gao's style matches the tastes of the jury,\" said Ya, who became famous for his novel \"Red Sorghum\" which was turned into a film by director Zhang Yimou.\n\n\"It's good news for Chinese writers. It's an encouragement which shows that the Chinese language has not been forgotten,\" he added. - Sapa-AFP"
