        "text": "Read\n\nAugust 24, 2011\n\nfrom \"Without Isms\"\n\nIt was not until I wrote \"Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather\" that I began to understand that in Chinese reality, memory and imagination are manifested in the eternal present, which transcends grammatical concepts and hence constitutes a time-transcending flow of language. For thoughts and perceptions, consciousness and the subsconscious, narration, dialogue and soliloquy, and even the alienated consciousness of the self, I turn to tranquil contemplation rather than adopting the psychological or semantic analysis of Western fiction, and unity is achieved through the linear flow of language. (69)\n\nRather than the starting point of modern literature, Nietzsche's Superman should more accurately be seen as the end point of romanticism. Kafka's self is a more accurate depiction of modern man. After him, a brilliant analysis of the self is to be found in some hundred thousand lines of posthumously published poetry by the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. (75)\n\nAs a writer I strive to position myself between the East and the West, and as an individual I seek to live at the margins of society. In this era in which, to use Liu Xiaofeng's words, the physical body ridicules the spirit, this is a better choice for me. (77)\n\n--\n\nfrom \"Cold Literature\"\n\nThis sort of literature of course did not just come into being today. Yet whereas in the past it mainly had to fight oppressive political forces and social customs, today it also has to do battle with the subversive commercial values of consumerist society. Its existence depends on the writer's willingness to endure loneliness. (79)\n\nCold literature is possible only if the pressures of politics and society can be escaped and a livelihood guaranteed. This is why it has been difficult for modern Chinese literature to be cold. (81)\n\n--\n\nfrom \"Literature and Metaphysics: About Soul Mountain\"\n\nIt is my view that the only responsibility a writer has is to the language he writes in. He can reform his creations as much as he wants, talk endlessly, write about nothing and play with the language, but he must respect the rules inherent in the language, otherwise there will be no art of language. (84)\n\nIn Soul Mountain, what is related via the three changing pronouns in different perceptions by the same subject, and this encapsulates the linguistic structure of the book. The third-person pronoun \"she\" is best described as the male subject's experiences and thoughts regarding the other sex, with whom a direct link is impossible. In other words, the book is a long soliloquy in which the pronouns keep changing. I prefer to call this a flow of language.\n\nLanguage is inherently not concerned with logic. As an expression of the psychological activities of humankind, it simply follows a linear process as it seeks actualisation. Moreover, it does not obey the objective concepts of time and space that belong to the physical world. When the discussion of time and space is imported into linguistic art from scientific aims and research methods, that linguistic art is entirely reduced to trifling pseudo-philosophical issues.\n\nBy not indicating tense, the Chinese language better reflects the basic nature of language. Actualized in language, present, past and future are identical and indistinguishable, and are not emphasised by inflecting the verb; only the psychological processes of the narrator and the listener or reader are involved. Moreover, reality and imagination, memory and thought have (90) no strict demarcations but are integrated within the process of the narration, which acknowledges only this actualisation in language and is not concerned with the real world. (91)\n\nMy relationship with myself has nothing to do with self-worship. The almighty heroes who have replaced God with the self and those who have tragically expunged the self disgust me equally. Apart from myself, I am nothing.\n\nWhat I experience are merely viewpoints or, one could say, narrative angles. I am a linguistic subject from whom perceptions arise. So my existence consists of narrating these perceptions. (92)\n\nThe importation of modern Western culture does not mean that contemporary Chinese literary creation will cut ties with its own cultural traditions. I am not anti-culture, but I reject the \"searching for roots\" label, because my roots have been under my feet from the time of my birth. It is simply a matter of how I understand these roots, including how I understand myself. (103)\n\n--\n\nfrom \"The Modern Chinese Language and Literary Creation\"\n\nDoes the Chinese language, past or present, have a stable grammatical structure? In Chinese, words are made up of single characters, and the gender, number and case inflections found in Western languages do not exist. Nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives can automatically function as different parts of speech. Verbs do not conjugate: there are no distinctions of time, voice or mood, so there are no morphological changes to indicate the past, present or future, direct or indirect speech, condition or supposition. Subject and predicate are not always determined by word order, so there can be considerable freedom. The subject is often dispensed with, and it can be difficult to distinguish between a sentence without a subject and a sentence without a pronoun. Active and passive voice, and present and past participles do not exist. Relative clauses do not require conjunctions, and compound sentences have no time or voice restrictions. The relationship between words or between sentences does not require grammatical collocation, and is often concealed by implication and by the tone of words or sentences. (107)\n\nLiterary creation is also a way of life. Through writing, an author gets closer to the truth of his own life and to an understanding of himself and the world. What every writer searches for, it should be said, is simply a unique language that he can use to express his own feelings. It is quite normal to find differences in literary language among the large numbers of writers who write in the same language; the only thing they have in common is that they are all bound by the grammatical rules of that language. (120) . . . . In fact, during the process of writing there is much that is not written into a work. Language can only articulate a minute portion of a person's feelings; a huge part is lost. For this reason, I believe what I write is still far removed from what I actually feel, but I can only try to use language to get as close as possible to this truth. (122)\n\n--\n\nfrom \"The Necessity of Loneliness\"\n\nIt is only when a child is alone that he starts to become an adult, and it is only when a person is alone that he can achieve maturity. . . . . To an ever greater extent, loneliness is a prerequisite for freedom. Freedom depends on the ability to reflect, and reflection can only begin when one is alone. . . . . When ideologies, trends in thinking, fashions or crazes are all-embracing, it is being lonely that affirms the individual's freedom. (165)"
