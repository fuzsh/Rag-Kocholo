        "text": "Gao Xingjian, Writer\n\nBorn in 1940, Gao Xingjian is a writer, painter, photographer, screenwriter and film director who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000. His book of fiction, Soul Mountain, 1989, was singled out in his Nobel Prize citation. His work is considered experimental, avant-garde and at times absurdist, and his translations of Samuel Beckett – another of Wilson’s cultural inspiration points – are acclaimed. In 1987 Gao Xingjian emigrated from China and now lives in France, and since that time his subject matter has been more universal in nature. His underpinning references include classical Chinese opera, folk culture and twentieth-century European drama. Wilson’s portrait offers a mesmerising meditation on language and human thought. The text La Solitude est un condition necessaire de la liberte is a quote from French existentialist writer Jean Paul Sartre."
