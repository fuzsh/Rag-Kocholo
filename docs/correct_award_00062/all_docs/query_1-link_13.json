        "text": "Gao Xingjian, a veteran exiled Chinese dissident novelist and playwright whose work has so far been chiefly known to specialists, said \"It's a miracle\" yesterday when told he had won the Â£615,000 Nobel prize for literature.\n\nThe news prompted almost equal surprise in much of the world and in Britain. A Leeds professor of Chinese studies said: \"There are half a dozen British dramatists who have a stronger claim\". But a London scholar said: \"He is a worthy choice.\"\n\nHe beat a field of candidates said in pre-prize speculation to include William Trevor, Salman Rushdie, VS Naipaul, Mario Vargas Llosa, JM Coetzee, Margaret Atwood, Ben Okri, Philip Roth and Norman Mailer.\n\nThough Gao is classed as an unperson in China, which did not react officially yesterday, the award was forecast to cause widespread private joy there as the literary equivalent of the country winning the World Cup.\n\nBut it also highlighted earlier feminist attacks on him for misogyny in his work, his interest in Chinese peasants' bottoms, and his obsessive theme of lust.\n\nHis acquaintance for 20 years, the Australian critic Linda Jaivin, wrote in a review of Soul Mountain, the novel the Nobel judges praised most: \"When Gao meets an 'ugly' woman of middle age, he can barely disguise his contempt. The women he encounters are of interest to him only so far as they are nubile.\"\n\nHowever, the judges' citation in Stockholm called it \"a great novel, one of those singular literary creations that seem impossible to compare with anything but themselves\".\n\nThey gave him the prize \"for an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity\".\n\nHorace Engdahl, the Swedish Academy's permanent secretary, told journalists: \"I think it is safe to say that Soul Mountain is one of the most remarkable creations of modern literature\".\n\nDuring the Chinese cultural revolution of the 1960s, Gao, now 60, had to burn manuscripts and was sent to a re-education camp. In the 1980s he was allowed to publish and have plays performed widely.\n\nBut in 1983, hearing he would be sent to a prison farm, he fled Beijing and spent 10 months wandering over 15,000 kilometres in Sichuan. Soul Mountain is based on this. In 1987 he left China. He currently supports himself mostly by painting in a working class Paris suburb.\n\nYesterday he said: \"I'm very, very surprised. It is a great honour and a sign of recognition for my work. It is really something, especially for a Chinese man, because the Nobel is a very heated issue in China. If I have chosen to live in exile, it is to be able to express myself freely without constraints.\"\n\nGao's novels and plays have been praised in France and Australia but are little known in Britain.\n\nMichael Hockx, lecturer in modern Chinese literature at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, said: \"He has been known to specialists at least since the 1980s.\n\n\"He is extremely influential as an experimental theatre writer. He caused something of a revolution in Chinese drama - mixing the western influences of Brecht and the theatre of the absurd with conventional Chinese practices.\n\n\"I would agree with the award. He is a worthy choice. He is writing in rich directions\".\n\nBut Bill Jenner, head of Chinese studies at Leeds University, said: \"It is an extraordinary choice. Very few people in China will have heard his name before the announcement.\n\n\"He made a bit of a name about 15 years ago for very sub-Beckett kind of stuff. He was a leading name of a short-lived literary flowering, copying western experimental theatre.\n\n\"I wouldn't have thought anyone would have thought him a runner for the Nobel prize. He's a perfectly good writer - but, if you're looking for someone special, half a dozen British dramatists spring to mind as having a stronger claim.\"\n\nCollected works\n\nBus Stop A play in the style of Samuel Beckett in which the cast waits for a bus which never comes. Variously described as a brilliant satire on Chinese inefficiency and \"a poor undergraduate copy of Waiting for Godot\". Carla Kirkwood, a Californian professor who has directed it on stage, said: \"The issues of procrastination and lack of self-initiative are universal\".\n\nSoul Mountain His first novel, about his flight from Beijing in 1983 after being warned he was to be sent to a prison farm, and his 10 months of wanderings in Sichuan. Described by professor Mabel Lee, of Sydney University, as \"the story of one man's quest for inner peace and freedom\".\n\nOne Man's Bible, his second novel. The Nobel citation says: \"The core of the book involves settling the score with the terrifying insanity usually referred to as China's cultural revolution\"."
