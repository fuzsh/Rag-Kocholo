        "text": "This book is part of the Cambria Sinophone World Series, headed by Professor Victor Mair (University of Pennsylvania).\n\nThe first Chinese-born winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Gao Xingjian is arguably one of the most innovative writers, artists, and playwrights of our times. He has probed the dynamics of Chinese and European literature and developed unique writing strategies, as seen in his seventeen plays, two novels (Soul Mountain and One Man’s Bible), and collections of short stories, poems, and criticism.\n\nIn his eponymous book Gao Xingjian: Aesthetics and Creation, which Gao calls the key to understanding his works, the Nobel laureate explains the theoretical underpinnings and rationales for his artistic innovations. In incisive and cogently argued essays, he exposes the political dynamics of so-called “modernity” in Western literature and art, and how this has been enthusiastically embraced in China since the 1980s. In other essays he analyses traditional and modern European and Chinese notions of fiction, theatre, and art, and elaborates on what aspects of writers and artists from both cultures have informed him in developing his own aesthetics in narration, performance, and the visual arts. For Gao, the writer or artist relies on impulses of the inner self and cannot be hostage to politics, the collective, the market, or any forces external to the self.\n\nThis book, which provides rare insights into Gao Xingjian’s ideas and thought processes, is indispensable and inspiring reading, underscoring how literature and art is a creative, human pursuit that cannot and should not be constrained by national or cultural boundaries.\n\nSee also Calling for a Renaissance by Gao Xingjian and Gao Xingjian and Transmedia Aesthetics edited by Mabel Lee and Liu Jianmei.\n\n“The book is a timely addition to the growing critical works and translations in Gao Xingjian studies. It also announces Gao (to English-language readers) as a major voice in literary aesthetics and politics, a Chinese Nobel Prize winner who remains a leading figure in creative circles and in dialogues and debates between China and the West. The English translations are easy to read and help to explain concepts of Gao’s that are not readily understood in Western languages. The work has been edited carefully and, while the language is appropriate for a critical work, technical terms have been explained and translated into common usage for lay readers. It is a beautifully produced book, with a cover that shows the writer Gao Xingjian engaged in deep introspection … highly readable and engaging.” Read the full MCLC review the Cambria Press blog.\n\nNobel Laureate Gao Xingjian is amongst the most challenging writers of the present era. He has probed the dynamics of Chinese and European literature and developed unique strategies for the writing of seventeen plays, two novels, a collection of short stories and a collection of poems. He has also written two collections of criticism.\n\nFor his contributions to literature Gao has received several prestigious awards. In 1985 he was awarded a DAAD fellowship in Berlin for six months, and in 1992 he was awarded the French title Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in Paris. In the year 2000 within weeks he was declared Nobel Laureate for Literature in Stockholm and Premio Letterario Feronia in Rome. In France he was feted with the award of Chevalier de l’Ordre de Légion d’Honneur, and the City of Marseille declared that 2003 would be designated “L’anné Gao Xingjian,” a year that would be devoted to showcasing his achievements.\n\nAbout the translator\n\nMabel Lee is an honorary professor of translation at the Open University of Hong Kong and an adjunct professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Sydney. Her research field is modern Chinese intellectual history and literature, and she is a member of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. She has published extensively on Lu Xun and 2000 Nobel Laureate Gao Xingjian (b. 1940), and has translated Gao’s Soul Mountain (2000), One Man’s Bible (2002), Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather (2004), and The Case for Literature (2006/7).
