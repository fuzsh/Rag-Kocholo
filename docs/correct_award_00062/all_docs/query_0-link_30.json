        "text": "The 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature is making big news in China, being hailed on television and the Internet, in a marked departure from the past.\n\nJust minutes after the Swedish Academy gave the award to Chinese writer Mo Yan, state-run television broke into its usual programming to relay the news. Millions of Chinese took to social media and micro-blogging sites to post their feelings, many calling the prize a triumph.\n\n2012 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n2012 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nMo Yan\n\nBorn in 1955, grew up in Shandong province in northeastern China.\n\nFirst short story published in a literary journal in 1981.\n\nBreakthrough work was Touming de hong loubo, first published in Chinese in 1986.\n\nSeen as one of the foremost contemporary authors in China.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy said his work \"with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary.\"\n\n\"I am proud of him as Chinese,\" said Beijing resident Zheng Qingcheng. \"The Nobel Prize is a world class prize. He is great. I am so happy for him.\"\n\nHu Yanyu, a 29-year-old finance officer, called it a first.\n\n\"I think this sends a signal that the foreign mainstream culture is now accepting Chinese culture, so I think this is very gratifying and worth congratulating,\" she said.\n\nBut this is not the first time someone from China has been given the prestigious honor. A troubled past\n\nIn 2000, the Swedish Academy awarded the literature prize to Chinese writer Gao Xingjian for his \"bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity . . . in the writing of Gao Xingjian literature is born anew from the struggle of the individual to survive the history of the masses.\"\n\nBut by the time the award was announced, Gao Xingjian had been living in France for 13 years, having been declared persona non grata by Beijing.\n\nMore recently, the Nobel Committee awarded the 2010 Peace Prize to jailed writer and activist Liu Xiaobo, infuriating China.\n\nChinese officials said awarding Liu a Nobel prize was an insult. Neither Liu nor his family was permitted to attend the award ceremony in Oslo, where his absence was marked by an empty chair on the stage.\n\nIn China, the anger over the so-called \"insult\" has lingered. Just this past June, China refused to grant a visa to former Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, whom it blames for the decision to award Liu the peace prize.\n\nChina changing course\n\nThis time, though, there will be no empty chairs.\n\n\"He said that he was overjoyed and scared and, yes, he is coming to Stockholm,\" said Swedish Academy permanent secretary Peter Englund, who praised Mo Yan for his \"hallucinatory realism.\"\n\nEditor-in-chief of the state run Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, said Thursday Moâ€™s winning the award was a sign the West is looking beyond Chinese dissidents.\n\nDissident anger\n\nBut not everyone is happy.\n\nHong Kong-based blogger Wen Yunchao criticized the committee for giving the prize to Mo, who serves as vice president of the pro-establishment China Writers Association.\n\n\"The two words 'Mo Yan' mean 'do not speak,' and they are a very real portrayal of the current political situation in China,\" Wen said. \"With Mo Yan winning of the prize, people in China will get the message that you can become an accomplice of an authoritarian government. As long as you have made enough contributions to literature, you will have the chance to win the most prestigious international award. Morally and politically, I think this will have devastating consequences.''\n\nNew insight into China\n\nThose who teach Mo Yan's works say they understand the criticism but they also say to focus only on the current politics is unfair.\n\nOne of them is Alexander Huang, a professor of English, theater and international affairs at George Washington University, and an author who has written about both Gao Xingjian and Mo Yan.\n\n\"Some of his [Mo Yan's] works were censored early on,\" he said. \"I think his works, especially the fantastical realism, has a lot to say about his society. In other words, his form of social criticism is more subtle.\"\n\nHuang says by putting the spotlight on Mo Yan, the Nobel Literature Committee may be signaling an important shift in how Chinese literature, as well as the whole region, needs to be viewed.\n\n\"We are only interested in the output by the so-called dissidents. We are less interested in art for art's sake. And in Mo Yan's humorist, satirical and humorist narratives about his society we see a different face of art and literature from that region,\" he said.\n\nUniversity of Maryland literature Professor Andrew Schonebaum agrees.\n\n\"This pick seems to celebrate Chinese cultural productivity on its own merits, as opposed to being really politicized,\" he said. \"When it comes to China in the last couple of decades, we in the States [the United States] have been primarily concerned with politics and economics, and this I think is a pretty crucial component that's often overlooked.\"\n\nBoth Huang and Schonebaum say the focus on Mo Yan could help bring attention to more artists and writers from China, perhaps even catapulting some onto the international scene.\n\nIf any of them manage to catch the eye of the Swedish Academy, they could join a growing list of influential artists and scientists. Seven other Nobel laureates were either born in China or are of Chinese heritage, although none lived in China at the time of their award."
