        "text": "Theater\n\nAt Hong Kong Festival, a Nobel Laureate Returns\n\nLin Zhaohua's production of Gao Xingjian's \"Of Mountains and Seas\" is the first time in more than two decades that a mainland Chinese cast and crew have performed one of Mr. Gao's works.\n\nBy Joyce Lau\n\nLetter from China\n\nEducation as a Path to Conformity\n\nFor all its emphasis on rigor and discipline, the Chinese education system is producing few students who can think for themselves or follow their passions -- and only a minority think that's a problem.\n\nBy Didi Kirsten Tatlow\n\nThe Nobel Guessing Game: A Mystery in Literature\n\nThe annual Nobel Prize in Literature, which is to be awarded in Stockholm on Thursday, assures the happy laureate a gilded place in posterity. Or does it? The Swedish Academy is so eccentric in its choice that the astonished winner often enjoys 15 minutes of fame and is quietly forgotten. No less bizarrely, the academy has overlooked some pillars of modern literature, like Proust and Joyce. Then there are those well-known writers who year after year are considered to be contenders only to be disappointed.\n\nBy Alan Riding\n\nExiled Writer Finds Politics Hard to Avoid In China Visit\n\nGao Xingjian, exiled Chinese writer who won Nobel Prize in Literature in 2000, stirs up controversy during three-day visit to Hong Kong, telling university audience that literature is above politics and does not serve politics; attributes his exile to need for freedom of expression; pro-Beijing figures warn him to watch his tongue, while pro-democracy leaders criticize Hong Kong's government for snubbing first Chinese novelist to win Nobel Prize (M)\n\nBy Mark Landler"
