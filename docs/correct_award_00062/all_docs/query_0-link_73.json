        "text": "If some men are born to greatness while others have greatness thrust upon them, the same must be true of Nobel laureates in the field of literature.\n\nThere are the larger-than-life figures, hearty and self-possessed rogues like Gunter Grass and Joseph Brodsky, who seemed born to win the prize; before the award, they seemed simply to be waiting for the Swedish Academy to catch up with the greatness they knew they embodied. When the nod came, they fit into their public roles like professional divers in sleek wet suits, adoring its political import.\n\nThen there is Gao Xingjian, a small and contemplative man who seems almost vanquished by the honour thrust upon him last October. The first Chinese-language recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature, he appears as comfortable with his sudden fame and responsibilities as Jackson Pollock was with a straight line.\n\nHere he sits in a midtown Manhattan hotel suite, quiet and mannered and sweetly still, though he wants nothing more than to get back to the writing table in his tiny Paris apartment, where he has lived since 1988. Only one small sign of discomfort is apparent: Unconsciously, his left hand pulls repeatedly at the cradle of skin between his right thumb and forefinger, stretching the flesh red.\n\nWhen the Nobel committee proclaimed Gao its latest honouree, critics insisted the choice was a political statement. Though his plays are regularly produced in France, where he is a citizen, the 61-year-old writer wasn't well-known to the English-speaking press. Therefore, went the argument, he couldn't have built up an artistically significant body of work. Making the first Chinese-born winner a man who had fled his native country to escape persecution and censorship was an obvious slap at Beijing, especially since his works were banned in his native country.\n\nYet Gao is not only a reluctant symbol of the resistance but a downright apolitical one. During his laureate speech to the academy in December, when he picked up the $1.5-million cheque, he went so far as to call for a \"cold literature\" that eschews the day-to-day concerns of the world. In an almost McLuhanesque division of forms, he proclaimed journalism to be a \"hot\" medium, equipped to handle politics and the quotidian concerns of social organization. Literature is the cool and dispassionate counterpart, concerned only with the overarching existential questions of the human condition.\n\n\"The writer stands at the margins of society,\" he says now, aided by Australian academic Mabel Lee, who translated Soul Mountain, which has just been published in Canada. He doesn't believe it is the writer's role to be a spokesperson for a cause. \"There are too many spokespersons for the people,\" he says in Mandarin through the petite Lee. \"Various political parties, even if they're in direct opposition with one another, still say they are the spokesperson for the people. The writer must speak his own words and not get mixed up with politics.\"\n\nStill, it must be difficult to resist. When the Nobel announcement came, Beijing ignored the news. Eventually, the Chinese Writers' Association dismissed the award by saying, \"He is French and not Chinese. The reason he won it is more political than literary.\" The Yangcheng Evening News called Gao \"an awful writer.\" Gao didn't rise to the bait. Asked now if he was disappointed at the government's lack of support, he says simply, \"I think the first thing would be to ask the Chinese government why they have adopted this attitude.\"\n\nHe was similarly reserved last month on a visit to Hong Kong, where he refrained from criticizing the Chinese government. He later admitted he was embarrassed by his capitulation. Perhaps it was simply a holdover of his life in China. Born into a liberal household in Jiangxi province -- his father was a bank official, his mother an amateur actress -- Gao studied French literature as a teen. Later, his language skills would give him a lifeline to the Western playwrights, including Beckett, Artaud, Ionesco and Brecht.\n\nWhen the Cultural Revolution took hold, however, he was a prime target for re-education. His wife turned him in, and he spent six years at hard labour. Still, he wrote constantly, pouring out hundreds of poems, plays and works of prose. None of that output survives, however. He burned it all for fear of being named a subversive intellectual. In the late 1970s, Gao secured a position as a playwright in residence at the Beijing People's Art Theatre, where he practised self-censorship in order to produce plays that would please the government.\n\nApparently, though, he wasn't a good enough censor. In 1981 he was placed under surveillance after writing an essay that Beijing felt was too heavily influenced by the decadent West. In 1983, when he wrote the Waiting for Godot-like Bus Stop, about a group of people who have been waiting for a bus for 10 years, the play was condemned as \"spiritual pollution.\" Three years later he wrote The Other Shore, only to see it banned. He was given permission to travel abroad on a painting fellowship in 1987, and simply didn't return home. \"Freedom is the basic prerequisite for writing,\" he explains, hands folded in his lap.\n\nWhile still in China, he had allowed himself to write freely on one work, without any regard for censorship. Soul Mountain took almost the entire decade to write. The epic novel was inspired by a five-month walking journey he took along the Yangtze River in 1983, after being misdiagnosed with lung cancer. Staring into the abyss of his own mortality, he had begun to reflect on existential issues.\n\nHe travelled through a string of various Chinese districts, observing the wildly different social structures and cultural traditions in the country. Soul Mountain reflects Gao's deep ambivalence toward society and social interaction. It recognizes the need for human contact while remaining wary of man's will to power and immense capacity for abuse of nature.\n\nAnd while the novel is set in China, it is intended as a universal work. \"Literature transcends national boundaries, racial boundaries,\" Gao insists. \"It goes deep into the issues that concern all human beings. That is why, when people read Greek tragedy -- it doesn't matter who reads it -- they are still moved by it.\"\n\nGao is an unabashed classicist, which is ironic considering the Nobel committee applauded him for his \"linguistic ingenuity\" and achievement in pushing forward the form of the novel. Picking up on his disquisition about hot and cold literature, he says that \"work is literature if tomorrow it still has value. Therefore literature can't follow trends.\n\n\"In the end,\" he continues, \"literature boils down to the same thing. It's about existence, human existence. Literature hasn't come up with any new themes. The literature of all different times -- it's still dealing with how one resolves issues of existence.\"\n\nStill, Gao is not above attacking contemporary problems. After a lifetime avoiding the interference of communist pols in his work, he now sees capitalist forces as a growing danger. \"In Western society, the consumerist trend is the greatest threat to literature. If a writer can't resist this sort of force, then we will have a marketized sort of literature, something just to suit the market. This is not good for writers.\"\n\nWhile the Nobel win has brought him a vastly larger audience than he ever imagined he would have, Gao is tired of the chaos. It is, he says, anathema to the creative process.\n\nEvery year, he sketches out the ensuing 12 months, blocking out time for painting, writing, and directing his plays. The Swedish Academy's nod played havoc with those plans, and with previous obligations he can't ignore.\n\nHe is trying to finish translating a play from the original French into Chinese. (Though banned in mainland China, all of his works have found their way onto the Internet there.) There is a book of essays and an album of his paintings that must be done in time for a July exhibition of his works in Avignon. With a weary smile, he says he is looking forward to October, when the Nobel spotlight will shift to someone else.\n\nReally? Are the distractions -- the attention, the interviews, the parties and the new people in his life -- that difficult to manage? For the first time in an hour, he answers in English. \"Yes,\" he says with finality. \"Very, very difficult.\""
