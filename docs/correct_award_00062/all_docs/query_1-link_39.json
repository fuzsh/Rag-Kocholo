In 2004, a team from the CCCB traveled to Paris and interviewed Gao Xingjian at his home. He told us about his childhood, his first contacts with literature and painting, his work process: narrate in freedom, the art of the moment, the zen spirit and his concept of beauty.\n\nRelated to The world of Gao, Soy CÃ¡mara online"
