Oracle recently announced the acquisition of Enterprise Role Management software provider Bridgestream, Inc. Enterprise Role Management is a component of identity management deployments to improve overall security and address regulatory requirements.

Oracle's Identity and Access Management Suite is a component of Oracle Fusion Middleware.

Increased focus on compliance regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA, has created a need for organizations to strictly control access to sensitive systems and monitor access privileges regularly. However, managing and monitoring who has access to what, on an individual user and resource basis, can be costly for large organizations.

Bridgestream's SmartRoles and Discoverer products address these issues by enabling role-based access control, where privileges are grouped by business roles, managing access and improving compliance. Enterprises use these products for analyzing existing access rights to define candidate roles, administering roles across the entire user population and enforcing segregation of duties during role assignment.
