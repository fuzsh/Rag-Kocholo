Oracle, the most acquisitive company in the software industry, bought closely held Bridgestream, gaining programs that control access to corporate data, research firm 451 Group reported. San Francisco-based Bridgestream disclosed the takeover to the 451 Group, saying that the purchase had closed, according to an Aug. 27 report by the research firm, which tracks technology mergers. The purchase would be the seventh this year for Redwood City-based Oracle, the world’s third-biggest software maker.
