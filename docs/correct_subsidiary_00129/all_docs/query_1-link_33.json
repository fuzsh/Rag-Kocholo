        "text": "A black woman in tech who has raised over $1 million for her company is considered a unicorn. Those whose companies have been acquired are even more rare. In a time when M&A is the new IPO, the number of black women who have had successful exits is as much a celebration of their accomplishments as it as a measure of the industry’s progress.\n\nAcquisitions don’t happen in a vacuum. They are often the result of access to a strong network, funding, social proof, company visibility and knowledge of or guidance through the process. Black women founders are less likely to have access to the funding and resources they need to create a strong company which leads to an uneven playing field at all stages of their startups.\n\nIn spite of those odds, these seven women have traversed the acquisition waters and come out on top. Celebrate them by sharing their stories:\n\nJewel Burks, Partpic\n\nJewel Burks is the co-founder of Partpic, an Atlanta based startup designed to streamline the purchase of maintenance and repair parts using computer vision technology. Jewel was a Google Entrepreneur- In- Residence, on the Forbes 30 under 30 list, presented at the White House Demo Day and raised over $2 million. Partpic was acquired by Amazon and currently Jewel serves as Team Lead for Visual Search at A9.com, an Amazon Company.

Attentive.ly was acquired by Blackbaud in 2016 making it the first tech startup with a black female founder on board in history to be acquired by a NASDAQ-traded company. Her current company, Fission Strategy, also helped write the source code, and in turn received equity, for CrowdTangle, which was acquired by Facebook in 2016. She also serves on the boards of Netroots Nation, Citizen Engagement Lab & Digital Undivided\n\nHeather Hiles, Pathbrite\n\nHeather is the founder of Pathbrite, the world’s leading portfolio learning platform which lets users aggregate and showcase all digital evidence of what they have created, achieved and mastered.
