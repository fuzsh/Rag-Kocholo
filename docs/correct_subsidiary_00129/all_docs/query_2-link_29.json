        "text": "Insider Attack and Cyber Security: Beyond the Hacker defines the nature and scope of insider problems as viewed by the financial industry. This edited volume is based on the first workshop on Insider Attack and Cyber Security, IACS 2007. The workshop was a joint effort from the Information Security Departments of Columbia University and Dartmouth College.\n\nThis book sets an agenda for an ongoing research initiative to solve one of the most vexing problems encountered in security, and includes the following topics: critical IT infrastructure, insider threats, awareness and dealing with nefarious human activities in a manner that respects individual liberties and privacy policies of organizations while providing the best protection of critical resources and services. In some sense, the insider problem is the ultimate security problem. This volume concludes with technical and legal challenges facing researchers who study and propose solutions to mitigate insider attacks.\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 85.59\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access\n\nLicence this eBook for your library\n\nInstitutional subscriptions"
