DmtiNa the last four years of our narrative, in which the unsettled state of the kingdom and the progress of foreign discovery appeared to demand the whole attention of the sovereigns, a most important revolution was going forward in the afl^rs of Italy. The death of Charles the Eighth would seem to have dissolved the relations recently arisen between that country and the rest of Europe, and to have restored it to its ancient independence. It might naturally have been expected that France, under her new mon- arch, who had reached a mature age, rendered still more mature by the lessons he had imbibed in the school of adversity, would feel the folly of reviving ambitious schemes, which had cost so dear and ended so disastrously. Italy, too, it might have been pre- sumed, lacerated and .still bleeding at every pore, would have learned the fatal consequence of invoking DigiLizedbyGoOglc 4 ITALUN WARS. foreign aid in her domestic quarrels, and of throwing open the gates to a torrent, snre to sweep down friend and foe indiacriminatelf in its progress. But experi- ence, alas ! did not bring wisdom, and passion tri- umphed as usual. Louis the Twelfth, on ascending the throne, as- sumed the titles of Dake of Milan and King of Naples, thus unequivocally annoancing his intention of assert- ing his claims, derived through the Visconti family, to the former^ and through the AngeviD dynasty, to the latter state. His aspiring temper was stimulated rather than satisfied by the martial renown he had acquired in the Italian wars ; and he was urged on by the great body of the French chiTalry, who, disgusted with a life of inaction, longed for a field where they might win new laurels, and indulge in the joyous licence of military adventure. Unhappily, the court of France found ready instru- ments for its purpose in the profiigate politicians of Italy. The Roman pontiff*, in particular, Alexander the Sixth, whose criminal ambition assumes something respectable by contrast with the low vices in which ^e was habitually steeped, willingly lent himself to a monarch who could so effectually serve his selfish schemes of building up the fortunes of his &mily. The ancient republic of Venice, departing from her usual sagacious policy, and yielding to her hatred of Lodovico Sforza, and to the lust of territorial acquisi- tion, consented to unite her arms with those of France against Milan, in consideration of a share (not the lion's share) of the spoils of victory. Florence, and many other inferior powers, whether from feiu* or weakness, or the short-sighted hope of assistance in their petty international feuds, consented either to DigiLizedbyGoOglc PARTITION OF NAPLES. 5 throw their weight iato the same scale, or to remain nentral.* Having thus secured himself from molestation in Italy, Louis the Twelfth entered into negotiations with snch other European powers as were most likely to interfere with hia designs. The emperor Maximilian* whose relations with Milan would most naturally have demanded his interposition, was deeply entangled in a war with the Swiss. The neutrality of Spain was secured by the treaty of Marcoussis, August 6th, 1498, which settled aU the existing diflTerences with that country. And a treaty with Savoy in the following year guaranteed a free passage through her mountain passes to the French army into Italy.f Having completed these arrangements, Louis lost no time in mustering his forces, which, descending like a torrent on the fair plains of Lombardy, effected the conquest of the entire duchy in little more than a fort- night ; and, although the prize was snatched for a moment from his grasp, yet French valour and Swiss perfidy soon restored it. The miserable Sfonsa, the dupe of arts which he had so long practised, was transported into France, where he lingered out the re- mainder of his days in doleful captivity. He had first called the harbariaiu into Italy, and it was a righteous retribution which made him their earliest victim. | By the conquest of Milan, France now took her place among the Italian powers.

These consequences, to which the Ita- lian states seemed strangely insensible, bad long been foreseen by the sagacious eye of Ferdinand the Ca- tholic, who watched the moTements of his powerful neighbour with the deepest anxiety. He had endea- voured, before the invasion of Milan, to awaken the difierent goTemments in Italy to a sense of their dan- ger, and to stir them up to some efficient combination against it.* Both he and the queen had beheld with disquietude the increasing corruptions of the papal conrt, and that shameless cupidity and lust of power which made it the convenient tool of the French mon- arch. By their orders, Garcilasso de la Vega, the Spanish ambassador, read a letter from his sovereigns in the presence of his Holiness, commenting on his scanda- lous immorality, his invasion of ecclesiastical rights appertaining to the Spanish crown, his schemes of selfish aggrandizement, and especially his avowed pnr- • Zurits, HUt. del Key Her- the btal conaequences of which he nando, torn. i. lib. g, cap. 31. predicted in a letter to a friend in Hartyi, in a letter written goon Venice, the fbrmei miniflter at after Sfoizft's recoveiy of his capi- the Spanish courL \" The long of tol, sayB that the Spanish sove- France,\" says he, \" after he has reigns \"could not conceal their dined with the duke of Milan, will joy at the event, «uch was their come and sup with you.\" (EpisL jealousy of France.\" (OpusEpiit. 207.)

Garcilasso coolly wtuted till the storm had subsided, and then replied undaunt- edly, \" That be had uttered no more than became a loyal snbject of Castile ; that he should never shrink from declariiig freely what his sovereigns commanded, or what he conceived to be for the good of Christen- dom ; and, if his Holiness were displeased with it, he could dismiss him from his court, where he was con- vinced, indeed, his residence could be no longer uBefuL\"'f * LotiiBXn,fbrthe|[00(Iofficea of the pope in the a^r of his di- Torce from the unfortimate Jeanne of France, promised the uncardi- nalled Ctesar Borgia the duchy of Valeace in Dauphin;, with a rent of 20,000 lirres, and a consider- able force to support him in his fla^tiouB ettterpiises against the princes of Romagna.

Garcilasso de la Vcf^a seems to have possessed little of the courtly and politic addrest of a diploma- tist. In a sabseqnent audience which the pope gave him together with a special embassy from Cas- tile, his blunt expostulation bo much exasperated his Holiness, that the latter hinted it would not coat him much to have him thrown into the Tiber.

Ferdinand had no better fortnne at Venice, where, his negotiations were conducted by Lorenzo Suarez de la Vega, an adroit diplomatist, brother ofGarci- lasso.* These negotiations were resumed after the occupation of Milan by the French, when the minister arailed himself of the jealousy occasioned by that event to excite a determined resistance to the propos- ed aggresdon on Naples. But the republic was too sorely pressed by the Torldsh war, — which Sforza, in the hope of creating a diversion in his own fovour, had brought on his conntry, — to allow leisure for other operations. Nor did the Spanish court succeed any better at this crisis with the emperor Maximilian, whose magnificent pretensions were ridiculously con- trasted with his limited authority, and still more limited revenues, so scanty, indeed, as to gain him the contemptuous epithet among the Italians of pochi denari, or \" the Moneyless.\" He had conceived him- self indeed, greatly injured, both on the score of his imperial rights and his connexion with Sforza, by the conquest of Milan ; but, with the levity and cnpidity essential to his character, he suffered himself, notwith- standing t^e remonstrances of the Spanish court, to be bribed into a truce with King Louis, which gave the latter fiill scope for his meditated enterprise on Naples.f Thus disembarrassed of the most formidable means of annoyance, the French monarch went briskly for- reToldng an offeniive ecdenBstical the subject of one of his dialogues. providoQ he had made in Spain, Quincuagenas, tiS. bat.

Frederic, the unfortunate king of Naples, saw himself with dismay now menaced with the toss of empire, before he had time to taste the sweets of it. He knew not where to turn for refiige, in his desolate condition, from the impending storm. His treasury was drained, and his kingdom wasted, by the late war. Hia subjects, although attached to his person, were too familiar with revo- lutions to stake their lives or fortunes on the cast. His countrymen, the Italians, were in the interest of his enemy ; and his nearest neighbour, the pope, had drawn from personal pique motives for the most deadly hostility.* He had as little reliance on the king of Spain, his natural ally and kinsman, who, he well knew, had always regarded the crown of Naples as his own rightful inheritance. He resolved, there- fore, to apply at once to the French monarch; and be endeavoured to propitiate him by the most humi- liating concessions, — ^the offer of an annual tribute, and the surrender into his hands of some of the prin- cipal fortresses in the kingdom. Finding these ad- vances coldly received, he invoked, in the extremity of his distress, the aid of the Turkish sultan, Btyazet, the terror of Christendom, requesting such supplies of troops as should enable him to make head against their common foe.

It even went so far as to guanmtee the &itbful discharge of the tribute proffered by the king of Naples.f But the reckless ambition of the French monarch, overleaping the barriers of prudence, and indeed of common sense, disdained the fruits of con- quest without the name. F^dinand now found himself apparently reduced to the alternative of abandoning the prize at once to the French king, or of making battle with him in defence of his royal kinsman. The first of these measures, which would bring a restless and powerful rival on the borders of his Sicilian dominions, was not to be thought of for a moment. The latter, which pledged him a second time to the support of preten- sions hc^tile to his own, was scarcely' more palatable. A third expedient suggested itself; the partition of the kingdom, as hinted in the negotiations with Charles the Eighth, by which means the Spanish government, if it could not rescue the whole prize from the grasp of Louis, would at least divide it with him.^ Instructions were accordingly given to Gralla, the * Guicciardini, Istoria, tora.i.

Care was taken at the same time to secure a party in the French councils to the interests of Ferdinand.* The suggestions of the Spanish envoy received additional weight from the report of a considerable armament then equipping in the port of Malaga. Its ostensible purpose was to cooperate with the Venetians in the defence of their possessions in the Levant. Its main object, however, was to cover the coasts of Sicily in any event from the French, and to afford means for prompt action on any point where circumstances might require it.

Th& comtnatid of the whole was intrusted to the Great Captain, Gonsalvo of Cordova, who since his return home had fully sustained the high reputation which his brilliant military talents had acquired for him abroad.

Among them may be particularly noticed Diego de Mendoza, son of the grand cardinal, Pedro de la Paz,* Goozalo Pizarro, lather of the celebrated adventurer of Peru, and Diego de Paredes, whose personal prowess and feats of extra- vagant daring furnished many an incredible legend for chronicle and romance.

It is then provided, that the northern portion, comprehending the Terra di Lavoro and Abmzzo, be assigned to France, with the title of King of Naples and Jeru- salem; and the southern, consisting of Apulia and Calabria, with the title of Duke of those provinces, to Spain. The dogana, an important duty levied on the flocks of the Capitanate, was to be collected by the officers of the Spanish government, and divided equally with Franoe. Lastly, any inequality between the respective territories was to be so adjusted, that the revenues accruing to each of the parties should be precisely equal. The treaty was to be kept pro- foundly secret until preparations were completed for the simultaneous occupatiou of the devoted territory by the combined powers.* Such were the terms of this celebrated compact, by which two European potentates coolly carved out and divided between them the entire dominions of a third, who had given no cause for umbrage, and with whom tbey were both at that time in perfect peace and amity. Similar instances of political robbery (to call it by the coarse name it merits) have occurred in later times; but never one founded on more flimsy ■ See the original treaty, apud Dumont, Coipt IKpIomstique, toin. iiL pp. as, 446.

The principal odium of the transaction has attached to Ferdinand, as the kiosmaa of the unfortunate king of Naples. His conduct, however, admits of some palliatory considerations that cannot be claimed for Louis. The Aragonese nation always regarded the be- quest of Ferdinand's uncle, Alfonso the Fifth, in &voi)T of bis natural offiipring, as an unwarrantable and illegal act. The kingdom of Naples had been won by their own good swords, and, as such, was the rightful inheritance of their own princes. Nothing but the domestic troubles of his dominions had pre- vented John the Second of Aragoo, on the decease of his brother, from asserting his claim by arms. His son, Ferdinand the Catholic, had hitherto acquiesced in the usurpation of the bastard branch of his house only from similar causes. On the accession of the present monarcli, he bad made some demonstrations of vindicating his pretensions to Naples, which, how- ever, the intelligence he received from that kingdom indaced him to defer to a more convenient season.* But it was deferring, not relinquishing his purpose. In the mean time, he carefully avoided entering into such engagements as should compel him to a different policy by connecting his own interests with those of Frederic ; and with this view, no doubt, rejected the alliance, strongly solicited by the latter, of the duke of Calabria, heir apparent to the Neapolitan crown, with his third daughter, the infanta Maria. Indeed, this disposition of Ferdinand, so far from being dissembled, was well understood by the court of Naples, as is acknowledged by its own historians.! • See Part II. Chapter S, of f Oisnnone, latoria di Nspoli, thiB History. lib. 29, cap. 3^-Ziirita, Hist, del bvGoogIc PARTITION OF NAPLES. 15 It may be thought that the undisturbed succession of four princes to the throne of Naples, each of whom had received the solemn recognition of the people, might have healed any defects in their original title, however glaring. But it may be remarked, in ex- tenuation of both the French and Spanish claims, that the principles of monarchical succession were but im- perfectly settled in that day ; that oaths of allegi- ance were tendered too lightly by the Neapolitans, to carry the same weight as in other nations ; and that the prescriptive ri^t derived from possession, neces- sarily indeterminate, wsb greatly weakened in this case by the comparatively few years, not more than forty, during which the bastard line of Aragon had occupied the throne, — a period much shorter than that, after which the house of York had in England, a few years before, successfully contested the validity of the Lancastrian title. It should be added, that Ferdinand^s views appear to have perfectly corre- sponded with those of the Spanish nation at large; not one writer of the time, whom I have met with, intimating the slightest doubt of his title to Naples, while not a few insist on it with tmnecessary em- phasis.* It is but feir to state, however, that foreign- ers, who contemplated the transaction with a more impartial eye, condemned it as inflicting a deep stain on the characters of both potentates. Indeed, some- thing like an apprehension of this, in the parties themselves, may be inferred from their solicitnde to deprecate public censure by masking their designs under a pretended zeal for religion.

Before the conferences respecting the treaty were brought to a close, the Spanish armada under Gon- saWo, after a detention of two months in Sicily, where it was reiiiforced by two thousand recmita, who had been serving as. mercenaries in Italy, held its course for the Morea. (September 21, 1600.) The Turkish squadron, lying before Napoli di Romania, without wait- ing GonsalTO's approach, raised the siege, and retreated precipitately to Constantinople. The Spanish general, then uniting his forces with the Venetians, stationed at Corfu, proceeded at once against the fortified place of St. George, in Cephalonia, which the Turks had lately irrested from the republic* The town stood high on a rock, in an impregnable position, and was garrisoned by four hundred Turks, all veteran soldiers, prepared to die in its defence. We have not room for the detiuls of this siege, in which both parties displayed imbounded courage and resources, and which was protracted nearly two months under all the privations of famine, and tlie inclemen- cies of a cold and stormy vrinter.t At length, weary with this iatal procrastination, Gonsalvo and the Venetian admiral, Pesaro, resolved on a simultaneous attack on separate quarters of the * Qiovio, Vitce Illuat.

The ramparts had been already shakeD by the miniDg operations of Pedro Navarro, who, in the Ita- lian wara, acquired such terrible celebrity in this de- partment, till then little understood. The Venetian caoDOD, larger and better served than that of the Spaniards, had opened a practicable breach in the vrorks, which the besieged repaired with such tempo- rary defences as they could. The signal being given at the appointed hour, the two amues made a despe- rate assault on different quarters of the town, under cover of a murderous fire of artillery. The Turks sustained the attack with dauntless resolution, stop- ping up the breach with the bodies of their dead and dying comrades, and pouring down volleys of shot, arrows, burning oil and sulphur, and missiles of every kind, on the heads of the assailants. But the despe- rate enei^, as well as numbers of the latter, proved too strong for them. Some forced the breach, others scaled the ramparts; and, after a short and deadly straggle within the walls, the brave garrison, four- fifths of whom with their commander had follen, were overpowered, and the victorious banners of St. Jago and St. Mark were planted side by side triumphantly on the towers.* The capture of this place, although accomplished at considerable loss, and after a most gallant resist- ance by a mere handful of men, was of great service to the Venetian cause ; since it was the first check given to the arms of Bajazet, who had filched one place after another firom the republic, menacing its whole colonial territory in the Levant.

Venetians gained him high reputation throughout Europe, and precisely of the kind which he most coveted, that of being the zealous defender of the faith; while it formed a favourable contrast to the cold supineness of the other powers of Christendom. The capture of St. George restored to Venice the possession of Cephalonia; and the Great Captain, having accomplished this important object, returned in the beginning of the following year, 1501, to Sicily. Soon after his arrival there, an embassy waited on bim from the Venetian senate, to express their grateful ' sense of bis services, which they testified by enrolling his name on the golden book as a nobleman of Ve- nice, and by a magnificent present of plate, curious silks and velvets, and a stud of beautiful Turkish horses. Gonsalvo courteously accepted the proffered honours, but distributed the whole of the costly lar- gess, with the exception of a few pieces of plate, among his friends and soldiers.* In the mean while, Louis the Twelfth having com- pleted his preparations for the invasion of Naples, an army, consisting of one thousand lances and ten tbou- SBod Swiss and Gascon foot, crossed the Alps, and directed its march towards the south (Jane 1, 1501). At the same time a powerful armament, under Philip de Ravenetein, with six thousand five hundred addi- tional troops on board, quitted Genoa for the Neapoli- tan capital. The command of the land forces was given to the Sire d'Aubigny, the same brave and experienced officer who had formerly coped with Gonsalvo in the campaigns of Calabria.f • Bemaldez, Botm Cat61icM, 228.— UIloa,VitadiCarloV,fol.4.

In this very reasonable petition, his Holiness, well drilled in the part he was to play, acquiesced without difficulty ; declaring himself moved thereto solely by his consider- ation of the pious intentions of the parties, and the nnwortbiness of King Frederic, whose treachery to the Christian commonwealth had forfeited all right (if he ever possessed any) to the crown of Naples.* From the moment that the French forces had de- scended into Lombardy, the eyes of all Italy were turned with breathless expectation on Gonsalvo, and his army in Sicily. The bustling preparations of the French monarch had diffused the knowledge of his designs throughout Europe. Those of the king of Spain, on the contrary, remained enveloped in pro- found secrecy. Few doubted that Ferdinand would step forward to shield his kinsman from the invasion which menaced him, and, it might be, bis own domi- nions in Sicily; and they looked to the immediate junction of Gonsalvo with King Frederic, in order that their combined strength might overpower the enemy before he had gained a footing in the king- dom.

They could scarcely credit, says Guieciardini, that Louis the Twelfth could be so blind as to reject the proffered vassalage and Bubstantial sovereignty of Naples, in order to share it with so artful and dangerous a rival as Ferdinand.* The unfortunate Frederic, who had been advised for some time past of the unfriendly dispositions of the Spanish government,! ^^ \"° refuge &om the dark tempest mustering against him on the opposite quarters of his kingdom.

Before quitting Rome, a brawl arose between some French soldiers and Spaniards resident in the capital ; each party asserting the paramount right of its own sovereign to the crown of Naples. From words they soon came to blows, and many Uves were lost before the fray could be quelled; a melancholy augury for the permanence of the concord so unright- eously established between the two govemments.t On the 8th of July, the French crossed the Neapo- litan frontier.

The invaders went forward, occupying one place after another with little resistance, till thej came before Capua, where they received a temporary check. During a parley for the surrender of that place, they burst into the town, and giving free scope to their fiendish passions, butchered seven thousand citizens in the streets, and perpetrated outrages worae than death on their defenceless wives and daughters. It was on this occasion that Alexander the Sixth's son, the ia&r moua Csesar Borgia, selected forty of the most beauti- ful from the principal ladies of the place, and sent them back to Rome, to swell the complement of hia seraglio. The dreadful doom of Capua intimidated further resistance, but inspired such detestation of the French throughout the country, as proved of infinite prejudice to their cause in their subsequent struggle with the Spaniards.* King Frederic, shocked at bringing such oalamities on his subjects, resigned his capital without a blow in its defence, and, retreating to the isle of Ischia, soon after embraced the counsel of the French admiral Ravenstein, to accept a safe-conduct into France, and throw himself on the generosity of Louis. (Oct. 1501.) The latter received him courteously, and assigned him the duchy of Anjou with an ample revenue for his maintenance, which, to the credit of the French king, was continued after he had lost all hope of recover- ing the crown of Naples-f With this show of me^- * Summonte, Hiit. di Na- 41. — Giannone, IitoriB di Napoll, poll, torn. iiL lib. 6, cop. 4 — Ub.

Frederic was the last of the illegitimate branch of Aragon who held the Neapolitan sceptre; a line of princes who, whatever mi^t be their characters in other respects, accorded that munificent patronage to letters which sheds a ray of glory over the roughest and most turbulent reign. It might have been ex- pected that an amiable and accomplished prince, like Frederic, would have done still more towards the mo- ral developement of his people, by healing the ani- mosities which had so long festered in their bosoms. His gentle character, however, was ill suited to the evil times on which he had fallen ; and it is not im- probable that he found greater contentment in the calm and cultivated retirement of his latter years, sweetened by the sympathies of friendship which ad- versity bad proved,* than when placed on the daz- zling heights which attract the admiration and envy of mankind.f * The reader will readily call them were produced in the daya to mind the Neapolitan poet Sao- of his advenity. nazaro, whose fidelity to hii royal master foims bo beautiful a con- + \" Neque mala vel bona,\" trait with the conduct of Pontano, lay* the philosophic Roman, and indeed of too many of hii \" qute vulgua putet ; multot, qui tribe, whose gratitude ia of that conflictaii adversii videantur, bea- sort that will only rise above zero tos ; cc plerosque, quamquam in the lunBhine of a court.

He felt natural regret at being called to act against a prince whose character he esteemed, and with whom he had once been placed in the most intimate and friendly re- lations. In the true spirit of chivalry, he returned to Frederic, before taking op arms agtunat him, the duchy of St. Angel and the other large domains with which that monarch bad requited his services in the late vrar, requesting at the same time to be released from his obligations of homage and fealty. The ge- nerous monarch readily complied with the latter part of his request, but insisted on his retaining the grant, which he declared an inadequate compensation, i^er all, for the benefits the Great Captain had once ren- dered him.* The levies assembled at Messina amounted to three hundred heavy-armed, three hundred light horse, and three thousand eight hundred infantry, together with a small body of Spanish veterans, which the Cas- tilian ambassador had collected in Italy. The num- ber of the forces was inconsiderable ; but they were in excellent condition, well disciplined, and seasoned to all the toils and difficulties of war. On the 6th of July, the Great Captdn landed at Tropea, and commenced the conquest of Calabria, ordering the fleet to keep along the coast, in order to furnish whatever supplies he might need. The ground was familiar to him, and his progress was &cilitated by • ZuritB, Hist, del Key Her- 230— Chrteica del Gmn Ca{»- nando, (om. i. lib. 4. cap. 35. — tan, cap. 21. — Lanuzo, Hiitorias, Giovio, Vitce lUiut. yin»uin, p. torn. i. lib. 1, c^. 14.

Notwithstanding the opposition or coldness of the great Angevin lords who resided in this quarter, the entire occupation of the two Calabriaa, with the exception of Tarento, was effected in less than a month.* This city, remarkable in ancient times for its de- fence i^tunst Hannibal, was of the last importance. King Frederic bad sent thither his eldest son, the Duke of Calabria, a youth about fourteen years of age, under the care of Juan de Guevara, count of Potenza, with a strong body of troops, considering it the place of greatest security in his dominions. Independently of the strength of its works, it was rendered nearly inaccessible by its natural position; having no communication with the main land except by two bridges, at opposite quarters of the town, com- manded by strong towers, while its exposure to the sea made it easily open to supplies from abroad. Gonsalvo saw that the only method of reducing the place must be by blockade. Disagreeable as the delay was, he prepared to lay regular siege to it, ordering the fleet to sail round the southern point of Calabria, and blockade the port of Tarento, while he threw up works on the land side, which commanded the passes to the town, and cut off its communications with the neighbouring country. The place, however, was well victualled, and the garrison prepared to maintain it to the last.f * Abarca, lUiyes de Angon, Hariana, Hiat. de Eapana, torn, torn. a. rey SO, c^.

The Spanish troops, cooped ap within their entrenchments, and disgusted with the languid monotony of their life, cast many a wistful glance to the stirring scenes of war in the centre of Italy, where Coesar Borgia held out magnificent promises of pay and plunder to all who embarked in his adventurous enterprises. He courted the aid, in particular, of the Spanish veterans, whose worth he well understood, for they had often served under his banner, in his feuds with the Italian princes. In consequence of these inducements, some of Gonsalvo'e men were found to desert every day ; while those who remained were becoming hourly more discontented, from the large arrears due from the government ; for Ferdi- nand, as already remarked, conducted his operations with a stinted economy, very different from the prompt and liberal expenditure of the queen, always compe- tent to its object.* A trivial incident, at this time, swelled the popu- lar discontent into mutiny.

Ravenstein, amhitious of eclipsing the exploits of the Great Cap- tain, turned his arms against Mitilene, with the de- sign of recovering it for the repuhlio. He tatally iiuled in the attack, and bis fleet was soon after scat- tered by a tempest, and his own ship wrecked on the isle of Cerigo. He subsequently found his way, with several of his principal officers, to the shores of Ca- labria, where he landed in the most forlorn and desperate plight. Gonsalvo, touched with his mis- fortunes, no sooner learned his necessities, than he sent him abundant supplies of provisions, adding a service of plate, and a variety of el^;ant apparel for himself and followers ; consulting his own munificent spirit in this, much more than the limited state of his finances.* This excessive liberality was very inopportune. The soldiers loudly complained that their general found treasores to squander on foreigners, while his own troops were defrauded of their pay. The Bis- cayans, a people of whom Gonsalvo used to say, \" he had rather be a lion-keeper, than undertake to govern them,\" took the lead in the tumult. It soon swelled into open insurrection ; and the men, forming them- selves into regular companies, marched to the gene- ral's quarters and demanded payment of their arrears. One fellow, more insolent than the rest, levelled a pike at his breast with the most angry and menacing looks. Gonsalvo, however, retaining his self-possession, gently put it aside, saying, with a good-natured smile, \" Higher, you careless knave, lift your lance higher, or you will nm me through in your jesting.\" As he * Bembo, Iitoris Viniziana, Vita Illuat.

Although stung to the heart by this audacious taunt, he made no reply ; but without changing a muscle of hia countenance, continued, in the same tone as before, to expostulate with the insurgents, who at length were prevailed on to draw off, and disperse to tbeir quarters. The next morning, the appalling spectacle of the lifeless body of the Biscayon, hanging by the neck from a window of the bouse in which he had been quartered, admonished the army that there were limits to the general's forbearance it was not prudent to overstep.* An unexpected event, which took place at this juncture, contributed even more than this monitory lesson to restore subordination to the army. This was the capture of a Genoese galleon with a valu- able freight, chiefly iron, bound to some Turkish port, as it was said, in the Levant ; which Gonsalvo, moved no doubt by his zeal for the Christian cause, ordered to be seized by the Spanish cruisers ; and the cargo to be disposed of for the satis&otion of bis troops. Giovio charitably excuses this act of hos- tility against a friendly power with the remark, that \" when the Great Captain did anything contrary to * Chi6nica del Qran Capitan, BiscByani ii noticed b; the Great cap.

The city whose insulated position has been noticed, was bounded on tbe north by a lake, or rather arm of the sea, forming an excellent interior harbour, about eighteen miles in circumference. The inhabitants, trusting to the natural defences of this quarter, had omitted to pro- tect it by fortifications, and the houses rose abruptly irom the mar^n of the basin. Into this reservoir the Spanish commander resolved to transport suck of his vessels then riding in. the outer bay, as from their size could be conveyed across the narrow isthmus which divided it from the inner. After incredible toil, twenty of the smallest craft were moved on huge cars and rollers across the in- tervening land, and safely launched on the bosom of the lake. The whole operation was performed amid the exciting accompaniments of discharges of ord- nance, strains of martial music, and loud acclama- tions of the soldiery. The inhabitants of Tarento saw with consternation the fleet so lately floating in the open ocean imder their impregnable walls, now quitting its native element, and moving, as it were, by ma^c, across the land, to assault them on tbe quarter where they were the least defeuded.f ' Giovio, Vita Magni Oon- a Bimilar manieuvTej executed by ■alvi, lib. 1, p. 893. bim in hia vara in Spain.

He accordingly entered into negotiations for a truce with the Great Captain, during which ar- ticles of capitulation were arranged, guaranteeing to the duke of Calabria and his followers the right of evacuating the place and going wherever they listed. The Spanish general, in order to give greater solemnity to these engagements, bound himself to ob< serve them by an oath on the sacrament.* On the 1st of March 1502, the Spanish army took pOBsessioQ, according to agreement, of the city of Tarento; and the duke of Calabria with his suite was permitted to leave it, in order to r^oin his father in France. In the mean time, advices were received from Ferdinand the Catholic, instructing Gonsalvo on no account to suffer the young prince to escape from his hands, as he was a pledge of too great importance for the Spanish government to re- linquish. The general in consequence sent after the duke, who had proceeded in company with the count of Potenza as far as Bitonto, on his way to the north, and commanded him to be arrested and brought back to Tarento. Not long after, he caused him to be conveyed on board one of the men-of-war rior in lize to thoie of GomoIto. more iireconcikbl; than tuual in De Bello Civili, lib. 1, cap. 54. the details of the siege.

Zurita vindicates it by a letter from the Neapolitan prince to Gonsalvo, requesting the latter to take this step, since he pre- ferred a residence in Spaiu to one in France, but could not with decency appear to act in opposition to his father's wishes on the subject. If such a let- ter, however, were really obtained from the prince, his tender years would entitle it to little weight, and of course it wonld afford no substantial ground for justification. Another explanation is oifered by Paolo Giovio, who states that the Great Captain, nndetennined what course to adopt, took the opinion of certiun learned jurists. This sage body decided \" that Gonsalvo was not bound by his oath, siuce it was repugnant to his paramount obligations to his master; and that the tatter was not bound by it, since it was made without his privity !\"f The man * ZuritB, Hist, del Key Her- tmrv to the fond prediction of nando, torn. i. lib. 4, cap. 56. — - his uiend Sannazaro ; Abarca, Reyei de Aragon, torn. ii. rey 30, cap. 11, Bee. 10-12. — \"Nam mihi, nam tempua ve- UUoa, Vita di Carlo V, fol, 9. — niet, cum reddita sceptre Lanuza, Historias, lib.

At the same time the Great Captain took care to muntain a turveiilanee over the duke, by means of the attendants on his person. We find no allu- uon to any promises under oath. The communication is too brief to clear up the difficulties in this dark transaction. As coming from Oonsalvo himself, the document has great interest, and I will give it to the reader in tlie original. \" A vuestras altezaa he dado aviso de la entrada de las randeras e gente de ruettraa altezas por la gracia de nuestro Sefior en Taren- to el primero dia de Haizo, e au en la platica que eetara con el duque Don Ferrando de ponerse al serricio y amparo de vuestras altezas syn otro partido ny ofrcci- miento demaa de certijicarle que en todo tiempo seria libre para yr donde quisiese sy vuestras altezas bten no le tratosen, y que vuestras altezas le temian d respeto que a tal persona como el se deve.

But coming from one of a noble, magnanimous nature, like Gonsalvo, exemplary in private life, and unstained with any of the grosser vices of the age, it excited general astonishment and reprobation, even among his contemporaries.

It was hu^l^ to be expected that the partitioa treaty between France and Spwn, made so mani- festly in contempt of all good iaith, would be main- tained any longer than suited the coDvenience o£ the respective parties. The French monarch, in- deed, seems to have prepared, from the first, to dispense with it so soon as he had secured his own moiety of the kingdom;* and sagacious men at the Spanish court inferred that King Ferdinand would do as much, when he should be in a situation to as- sert his claims with success.-|- * Peter Martyr, in a letter rum animos avertere.

It was altogether improbable, whatever might be the good &ith of the partiee, that an arrangement could long subsist, which so rudely rent asunder the members of this ancient monarchy ; or that a thou- sand points of collision should not arise between rival hosts, lying as it were od their arms within bowshot of each other, and in view of the rich spoil which each regarded as its own. Such grounds for rapture did occur, sooner probably than either party had foreseen, and certiunly before the king of Aragon was prepared to meet it. The immediate cause was the extremely loose lan- guage of the partition treaty, which assumed such a geographical division of the kingdom into four provinces as did not correspond with any ancient division, and still leas with the modem, by which the number was multiplied to twelve.* The central por- tion, comprehending the Capitanate, the Basilicate, and the Principality, became debatable ground be- tween the parties, each of whom insisted on these as forming an integral part of its own moiety.

It is scarcely possible that language so loose, in a matter requiring mathematical precision, should have been unintentional. Before Gonsalvo de Cordova had completed the conquest of the soathem moiety of the kingdom, and while lying before Tarento, he received intelli- gence of the occupation by the French of several places, both in the Capitanate and Basilicate. He detached a body of troops for the protection of these countries, and, after the surrender of Tarento, march- ed towards the north to cover them with his whole army. As he was not in a condition for immediate hostilities, however, be entered into negotiations, which, if attended with no other advantage, would at least gain him time.f The pretensions of the two parties, as might have been expected, were too irreconcilable to admit of compromise ; and a personal conference between the * The provision of the parti- + Zuiita, Hiit. del Rey Her- tion treaty, that the Spaniard* nando, tom.

But neither of the two monarchs had further in- structions to give; and the Catholic king contented himself with admonishing his general to postpone an open rupture as long as possible, that the govem- ipent might have time to provide more effectually for his support, and strengthen itself by alliance with other European powers. But, however pacific may have been the disposition of the generals, they had no power to control the passions of their soldiers, who, thus brought into immediate contact, glared on each other with the ferocity of bloodhounds, ready to slip the leash which held them in temporary check. Hostilities soon broke out along the lines of the two armies, the blame of which each nation charged on its opponent. There seems good ground, however, for imputing it to the French; since they were al- together better prepared for war than the Spaniards, and entered into it so heartily as not only to assail places in the debatable ground, but in Apulia, which bad been unequiyocally assigned to their rivals.* In the mean while, the Spanish court fruitlessly endeavoured to Interest the other powers of Europe * D'Auton, Hut. de Louya cide the quarrel between th^ XII, part. 3, chap. 3-7. — Zurita, rsBpective nationi by single com- HUt. del Rey Hernando, torn. i. bat.

The emperor Maximilian, aJthough dissatiefied witli the occupation of Milan by the French, appeared wholly engroflsed with the frivo- loua ambition of a Roman coronation. The pontiff and his son, Ciesar Borgia, were closely bound to King Louis by the assistance which he had rendered tbem in their marauding enterprises against the neighbouring chiefs of Romagna. The other Italian princes, although deeply incensed and disgusted by this infamous alliance, stood too much in awe of the «olo98al power, which had planted its foot so firmly on their territory, to offer any resistance. Venice alone, surveying from her distant watch-tower, to borrow the words of Peter Martyr, the whole extent of the political horizon, appeared to hesitate. The French ambassadors loudly called on her to fiilfil the terms of her late treaty with their master, and support him in his approaching quarrel; but that wily republic saw with distrust the encroaching am- bition of her powerful neighbour, and secretly wished that a counterpoise might be found in the success of Aragon. Martyr, who stopped at Venice on his re- turn from Egypt, appeared before the senate, {Oct. 1501>) and employed all his eloquence in supporting bis master's cause in opposition to the French envoys ; but his pressing entreaties to the Spanish sovereigns to send thitber some competent person, aa a resident minister, show his own conviction of the critical po- sition in which their affairs stood.* • DftTU, Hilt, de Veni»e, torn, de la Vega was there, a penon of ill p. 8*5. — Bembo, Istoria Vini- whom Gonzalo de Oviedo wntet, ziana, torn. i. lib. 6. — Peter Mar- \" Fue gentil caboltera, 4 aabio, i tyr, OpuB Eirirt. epi»t. 238, 240, de grwi prudencia ;••••• muy XSi. — ThiB may appear strange, entendido ^ de mucho repoio i ho- conudeiing that Lorenzo Suorez neato £ afable 6 de Itnda conver- DigiLizedbyGoOglc 38 ITALIAN WARS.

The former, hotteyei, was ignorant of the Latin luiguBge, in which they were written. Martyr playfully alludes to this in one of his epistles, reminding the queen of her promise to interpret them Uthfully to her husband.

The command was in-> trusted to the duke of Nemours, a brave and chival- rous young nobleman of the ancient house of Ar- magnac, whom family connexions more than talents had raised to the perilous post of viceroy over the head of the veteran D'Aubigny. The latter would have thrown up his commission in disgust, but for the remonstrances of his sovereign, wlio prevailed on him to remain where his counsels were more than ever ne- cessary to supply the inexperience of the young com- mander. The jealousy and wilAilnese of the latter, however, defeated these intentions : and the misunder^ standing of the chiefs, extending to their followers, led to a &tal want of concert in their movements.

Beemed to realize all tbe imaginaiy perfections of chlTalry.* ' Notwithstanding tbe small numbers of the French force, the Great Captain was in no condition to cope with them. He had received no reinforcements from Lome since he first landed in Calabria. His little corps of veterans was destitute of proper clothing and equipments, and the large arrears due to them made the tenure of their obedience extremely precariou8.f Since ailairs' began to assume their present menacing aspect, he had been busily occupied with drawing together the detachments posted in various parts of Calabria, and concentrating them on the town of Atella in the Basilicate, where he had established his own quarters. He had also opened a corre- spondence with the barons of the Aragonese &ction, who were most numerous as well as most powerful in the northern section of the kingdom, which bad been assigned to the French. He was particularly fortunate in gaining over tbe two Colonnas, whose authority, powerful connexions, and large military ex- perience proved of inestimable value to him. | * Guicciardini, Istoria, lib.

To this he unhesitatinglj answered, that \" the Capitanate be- longed of right to his own master; and that, with the blessing of God, he would make good its defence against the French king, or any other who should invade it.\" Notwithstanding the bold front put on his affiurs, however, he did not choose to abide the assault of the French in his present position. He instantly drew off with the greater part of his force to Bar- letta, a fortified seaport on the confines of Apulia, on the Adriatic, the situation of which would enable him either to receive supplies from abroad, or to effect a retreat, if necessary, on board the Spanish fieet, which still kept the coast of Calabria. The remainder of his army he distributed in Bari, Andria, Canosa, and other adjacent towns; where he confi- dently hoped to maintain himself till the arrival of leinforcements, which he solicited in the most press- ing manner from Spain and Sicily, should enable him to take the field on more equal terms against his adversary.* military science, but his fondnesi than the artist.

Some were for besieging Ban, held by the illustrious and unfortunate Isabella of Aragon;* others, in a more chivalrous spirit, opposed the attack of a place defended by a female, and advised an immediate assault OQ Barletta itself, whose old and dilapidated works might easily be forced, if it did not at once surrender. The duke of Nemours, deciding on a middle course, determined to invest the last-men- tioned town ; and, cutting off all communication with the surroanding country, to reduce it by regalar blockade. This plan was unquestionably the least eligible of all, as it would allow time for the enthu- siasm of the French, the fv/ria Ftwicese, as it was called in Italy, which carried them victorious over so many obstacles, to evaporate, while it brought into play the stern resolve, the calm, nnBincbing endur- ance, which distinguished the Spanish soldier.f One of the first operations of the French viceroy was the siege of Canosa, (July 2, 1502,) a strongly fortified place west of Barletta, garrisoned by six hun- dred picked men under the engineer Pedro Navarro. The defence of the place justified the reputation of this gallant soldier.

He had prepared to Bus- taiD a third, resolved to bury himself under the ruins of the town rather than surrender. But Gonsalvo, un- able to relieve it, commanded him ta make the best terms he could, saying \" the place was of &r less valne than the lives of the brave men who defended it.\" Navarro found no difficulty in obtaining an honourable capitulation; and the little garrison, dwindled to one-third of its original number, march- ed out through the enemy's camp, with colours flying and music playing, as if in derision of the powerful force it had bo nobly kept at bay.* After the capture of Canosa, D^Aubigny, whose misunderstanding with Nemours still continued, was despatched with a small force into the soatb, to over- run the two Calabriaa. The viceroy, in the mean while, having fruitlessly attempted the reduction of sevenil strong places held by the Spaniards in the neighbourhood of Barletta, endeavoured to straiten the garrison there by desolating the surrounding country, and sweeping off the flocks and herds which grazed in its fertile pastures. The Spaniards, how- ever, did not remain idle within their defences, but, sallying out in small detachments, occasionally re- trieved the spoil from the hands of the enemy, or annoyed him with desultory attacks, ambuscades, anA * Chr6nica del Gran Capitan, Their gallaDtiy in the defence of cap. 47. — Zorita, Hist, del Bey Canosa elicits a hearty eulodutn Hernando, torn. i. lib. 4, cap. 69. from Jean D'Auton, the loyal — Oiovio, Vitte Illuat.

The knights on both sides, not content with the usual military rencontres, defied one another to jousts and tourney, eager to establish their prowess in the noble exercises of chi- valry. One of the most remarkable of these meet- ings took place between eleven Spanish and as many French knights, in consequence of some disparaging remarks of the latter on the cavalry of their enemies, which they affirmed Inferior to their own. The Ve- netians gave the parties a fair field of combat in the neutral territory under their own walls of Trani. A gallant array of well-armed knights of both nations guarded the lists, and maintained the order of the tight. On the appointed day (Sept. 20, lfi02) the champions appeared in the field, armed at all points, with horses richly caparisoned, and barbed or covered vrith steel panoply hke their masters. The roofs and battlements of Trani were covered with spectators, while the lists were thronged with the French and Spanish chivalry, dach staking in some degree the national honour on the issue of the contest. Among the Castilians were Diego de Paredes and Diego de Vera, while the good knight Bayard was most con- spicuous on the other side. As the trumpets sounded the appointed signal, the hostile parties rushed to the encounter. Three Span- iards were borne from their saddles by the rudeness of the shock, and four of their antagonists' horses slain. * B«ma1dez, Reyes Cat61icoB, Carlo V, fol. 10. — Chr6iuca del US. cap. 169. — Ulloa, VtU di Gran Capitan, cap. 66.

Long before that hour all the French, save two, one of tbem the chevalier Bayard, had been dismonnted, and their horses, at which the Spaniards had aimed more than at the riders, disabled or slain. The Spaniards, seven of whom were still on horseback, pressed hard on their adversaries, leaving little doubt of the fortune of the day. Tbe latter, however, intrenching themselves behind the carcases of their dead horses, made good their defence against the Spaniards, who in vain tried to spur their terrified steeds over the barrier. In this way the fight was protracted till sunset ; and, as both parties continued to keep possession of the iield, the palm of victory was adjudged to neither, while both were pronounced to have demeimed themselves like good and valiant knights.* The tourney being ended, the combatants met in the centre of the lists, and embraced each other in the tme companionship of chivalry, \" making good cheer together.\" says an old chronicler, before they separated.

Bayard denied the charge, and defied the Spaniard to prove it in single fight, on horse or on foot, as he best liked. Sotomayor, aware of his antagonist's uncommon horsemanship, preferred the latter alternative. At the day and hour appointed, (Feb. 2, 1503,) the two knigbts entered the lists, armed with sword and dagger, and sheathed in complete harness; al- tbougb, with a degree of temerity anasual in these combats, they wore their visors up. Both combatants knelt down in silent prayer for a few moments, and then rising and crossing themselves, advanced straight against each other ; \" the good knight Bayard,\" says Brantome, \" moving as light of step, as if he were going to lead some fair lady down the dance.\" The Spaniard was of a large and powerful frame, and endeavoured to crush his enemy by weight of blows, or to close with bim and bring him to the ground. The latter, naturally inferior in strength, was rendered still weaker by a fever, from which he had not entirely recovered. He was more light and agile than his adversary, however ; and superior dex- terity enabled him not only to parry his enemy's strokes, hut to deal bim occasionally one of his own, while be sorely distressed him by the rapidity of his movements.
