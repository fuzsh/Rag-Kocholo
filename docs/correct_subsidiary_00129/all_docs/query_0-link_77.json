        "text": "As a Black women founder, the facts of being underrepresented, underfunded and undervalued are as prevalent as they are daunting. Yet, I haven’t allowed the chips stacked against me to prevent me from pursuing my entrepreneurial dreams. My secret weapon is a support system that answers my tough entrepreneurship questions, puts me in spaces that highlight my abilities and won’t let me play small when it comes to building my company. It is also the secret weapon of the 400+ Black women founders who attended the second annual Black Women Talk Tech Conference at Microsoft’s NYC headquarters.\n\nBlack Women Talk Tech, is a community creating a new narrative for Black women founders — billionaires. Started by three Black women tech founders, the group’s conference — aptly named “Roadmap to Billions” — is the only conference to bring together Black women founders from early stage to post-acquisition. Strategically positioned across the last day of Black History Month and the first day of Women’s History Month, the two-day event offered mastermind keynotes and panels, an award ceremony, a pitch competition and ample opportunities to network. Guest speakers included prominent Black women tech founders and allies: Jean Brownhill, Founder & CEO of Sweeten; Richelieu Dennis, CEO of Unilever-acquired Sundial Brands and new owner of Essence Magazine; Heather Hiles, serial entrepreneur, VC and former Deputy Director at The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and Alicia Syrett VC-fund founder and recurring panelist on CNBC's PowerPitch.\n\nHere are some of the top takeaways:\n\nDelegate to the right people as soon as you can\n\n“Make a ‘to-don’t’ list. What can you delegate, defer, delete? Delegating gives someone else an opportunity.” - Tonya Ladipo, CEO of The Ladipo Group\n\n“Build a great team at any stage of your business. Know when you need to hire another person and what they should be responsible for. Hold them accountable to those metrics.” - Candace Mitchell, Co-Founder & CEO of Myavana\n\n“Outsource what you can when you’re small and lean. Templatize the process as soon as you can.” - Dawn Dickson, Founder & CEO of PopCom\n\n“Know the invisible cost of not having the right people on your team.” - Alicia Thomas, Founder & CEO of Dibs Technology\n\nBuild a network of genuine support\n\n“Find similar founders and workshop the answers to your toughest problems. Find partners that are also serving your customer that you can build with.” - Tereza Nemessanyi, Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Microsoft\n\n“There is the false sense of scarcity that there is only room for one of us at the top. But, we can only thrive if we all work together.” - Jean Brownhill, Founder & CEO of Sweeten\n\n“We have a breadth of relationships but we need to have depth in those relationships. A relationship you can’t activate is not a relationship.” - Denise Hamilton, Founder & CEO of WatchHerWork\n\n“Find people who can see your worth and advocate for you.” - Jasmine Greenaway, Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft\n\nStay focused and go after what you want\n\n“Stay focused on what your North Star is and work to make it as singular as possible. It helps to make decisions when you know exactly where you are headed.” - Richelieu Dennis, Co-Founder & CEO Sundial Brands\n\n“The only thing that separates you from what you want to do is your intention to do it.” - Juanita Lott, Former Founder & CEO of Bridgestream Software (now Oracle) turned Investor\n\n“Own your affirmations. Make them declarative statements that you put on post-it notes that you can see every day.”- Samira Salman, Founder & CEO of Salman Solutions\n\n“Lead with your credentials so people will pay attention. Present yourself with confidence, yet humility.” - Lauren Maillian, Entrepreneur, Author, Investor and Host of ‘Quit Your Day Job’\n\nAcknowledge setbacks and move on\n\n“Practice ‘intense realism’. Don’t complain about the hill. Acknowledge that it’s there and that you have to climb it.” - Samira Salman, Founder & CEO of Salman Solutions\n\n“Take the ‘no’s’ as a misalignment to your mission or use them as feedback to make things better.” - Chrissa McFarlane, CEO of Patientory\n\n“Look beyond the microaggressions to get where you need to go. Being a woman and a minority, they are going to happen. But don’t let it weigh you down.” - Sarah Kunst, Founder & CEO of Proday\n\nUse difference as an asset\n\n“When you’re pitching people [clients, partners or investors], they want to know what your ‘why’ is. Spend most of your time perfecting the story around what your ‘why’ is.” - Rakia Reynolds, Founder & CEO of Skai Blue Media\n\n“Don’t align yourself with people who are just like you because you don’t want to have tension or conflict. Tension and conflict [when respect is involved] breed innovation.” - Richelieu Dennis, Co-Founder & CEO Sundial Brands"
