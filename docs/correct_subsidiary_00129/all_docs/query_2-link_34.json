        "text": "Evolution of the Creede Caldera and its relation to mineralization in the Creede mining district, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBarton, Paul B.; Rye, Robert O.; Bethke, Philip M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAt 25 Ma a major epithermal silver and base metal deposit formed in rhyolitic welded tuff near Creede, Colorado. Nearly 24000 metric tons of silver, appreciable lead, and small amounts of zinc, copper, and gold, have been produced from large, crustified veins under Bachelor and Bulldog Mountains north and northwest of Creede. Prior geologic, hydrologic, and stable-isotope studies showed that ore deposition was associated with the mixing and boiling of waters from diverse sources and suggester that a critical part of the ore-forming fluid may have originated within the ancient lake and sediments of the lacustrine Creede Formation that filled the Creede caldera. Two drill holes that sampled the heretofore hidden lower half of the Creede Formation are the focus of this book. The Creede caldera formed at 26.9 Ma within a high constructional plateau of silicic ashflows that covered and were sporadically interlayed with, intermediate lavas and lahars from large stratovolcanoes. The Creede caldera lake had an inflow evaporation balance that did not permit rapid filling to create a brim-full deep lake. Thus salts were evaporatively concentrated; but, with the exception of possible gypsum, no evaporite minerals preserved. Cool springs deposited travertine as mounds and contributed to limestone interlaminations within the sediment. The lake bottom was anoxic, and bacterial reduction of sulfate led to extreme sulfur isotopic fractionation in diagenetic pyrite. The caldera gradually resurged, converting the initial equant lake into an arcuate moat. Resurgent doming, alluvial fans, lacustrine sediments, ashfalls, and lava domes displaced water, lifted the lake so that it overlapped what later became the southern edge of the mineralized are, and eventually filled the basin. At 25.1 Ma an unseen pluton intruded beneath the northen part of the Creede district and created a convecting olume that drew in brine from the Creede caldera fill, meteotic water from highlands to the north\n\nRecognition of primary and diagenetic magnetizations to determine the magnetic polarity record and timing of deposition of the moat-fill rocks of the Oligocene Creede Caldera, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nReynolds, Richard L.; Rosenbaum, Joseph G.; Sweetkind, Donald S.; Lanphere, Marvin A.; Robert, Andrew P.; Verosub, Kenneth L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks of the Oligocene Creede Formation fill the moat of the Creede caldera, which formed at about 26.9 Ma during the eruption of the Snowshoe Mountain Tuff. Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies of two cores (418 and 703 m long) that penetrated the lower half of the Creede Formation, in addition to paleomagnetic and isotopic dating studies of stratigraphically bracketing volcanic units, provide information on the age and the time span of sedimentation of the caldera fill. Normal polarity magnetization are found in Snowshoe Mountain Tuff beneath the moat sediments; in detrital-magnetite-bearing graded tuffs near the bottom of the moat fill; in an ash-fall deposit about 200 m stratigraphically about the top of core 2; and in postcaldera lava flows of the Fisher Dacite that overlie the Creede Formation. Normal polarity also characterizes detrital-magnetite-bearing tuff and sandstone unites within the caldera moat rocks that did not undergo severe sulfidic alteration. The combination of initially low magnitude of remanent magnetization and the destructive effects of subsequent diagenetic sulfidization on detrital iron oxides results in a poor paleomagnetic record for the fine-grained sedimentary rocks of the Creede Formation. these fine-grained rocks have either normal or revered polarity magnetizations that are carried by magnetite and/or maghemite. Many more apparent reversals are found that can be accommodated by any geomagnetic polarity time scale over the interval spanned by the ages of the bracketing extrusive rocks. Moreover, opposite polarity magnetization are found in specimens separated by only a few centimeters, without intervening hiatuses, and by specimens in several tuff beds, each of which represents a single depositional event. These polarity changes cannot, therefore, be attributed to detrital remanent magnetization. Many polarity changes are apparently related to chemical remanent magnetizations carried by\n\nCentral San Juan caldera cluster: Regional volcanic framework\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLipman, Peter W.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nEruption of at least 8800 km3 of dacitic-rhyolitic magma as 9 major ash-slow sheets (individually 150-5000 km3) was accompanied by recurrent caldera subsidence between 28.3 and about 26.5 Ma in the central San Juan Mountains, Colorado. Voluminous andesitic-decitic lavas and breccias were erupted from central volcanoes prior to the ash-flow eruptions, and similar lava eruptions continued within and adjacent to the calderas during the period of explosive volcanism, making the central San Juan caldera cluster an exceptional site for study of caldera-related volcanic processes. Exposed calderas vary in size from 10 to 75 km in maximum diameter, the largest calderas being associated with the most voluminous eruptions. After collapse of the giant La Garita caldera during eruption if the Fish Canyon Tuff at 17.6 Ma, seven additional explosive eruptions and calderas formed inside the La Garita depression within about 1 m.y. Because of the nested geometry, maximum loci of recurrently overlapping collapse events are inferred to have subsided as much as 10-17 km, far deeper than the roof of the composite subvolcanic batholith defined by gravity data, which represents solidified caldera-related magma bodies. Erosional dissection to depths of as much as 1.5 km, although insufficient to reach the subvolcanic batholith, has exposed diverse features of intracaldera ash-flow tuff and interleaved caldera-collapse landslide deposits that accumulated to multikilometer thickness within concurrently subsiding caldera structures. The calderas display a variety of postcollapse resurgent uplift structures, and caldera-forming events produced complex fault geometries that localized late mineralization, including the epithermal base- and precious-metal veins of the well-known Creede mining district. Most of the central San Juan calderas have been deeply eroded, and their identification is dependent on detailed geologic mapping. In contrast, the primary volcanic morphology of the\n\nGeologic map of the Cochetopa Park and North Pass Calderas, northeastern San Juan Mountains, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLipman, Peter W.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado have long been known as a site of exceptionally voluminous mid-Tertiary volcanism, including at least 22 major ignimbrite sheets (each 150-5,000 km3) and associated caldera structures active at 33-23 Ma. Recent volcanologic and petrologic studies in the San Juan region have focused mainly on several ignimbrite-caldera systems: the southeastern area (Platoro complex), western calderas (Uncompahgre-Silverton-Lake City), and the central cluster (La Garita-Creede calderas). Far less studied has been the northeastern San Juan region, which occupies a transition between earlier volcanism in central Colorado and large-volume younger ignimbrite-caldera foci farther south and west. The present map is based on new field coverage of volcanic rocks in seventeen 7.5' quadrangles in northeastern parts of the volcanic field, high-resolution age determinations for 120 new sites, and petrologic studies involving several hundred new chemical analyses. This mapping and the accompanying lab results (1) document volcanic evolution of the previously unrecognized North Pass caldera and the morphologically beautifully preserved but enigmatic Cochetopa basin, including unique features not previously described from ignimbrite calderas elsewhere; (2) provide evidence for a more rapid recurrence of large ignimbrite eruptions than previously known elsewhere; (3) quantify the regional time-space-volume progression from the earlier Sawatch magmatic trend southward into the San Juan region; and (4) permit more rigorous comparison between the broad mid-Tertiary magmatic belt in the western U.S. Cordillera and the type continental-margin arc volcanism in the central Andes.\n\nDetermining the physical and chemical processes behind four caldera-forming eruptions in rapid succession in the San Juan caldera cluster, Colorado, USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCurry, A. C.; Caricchi, L.; Lipman, P. W.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA primary goal of volcanology is to understand the frequency and magnitude of large, explosive volcanic eruptions to mitigate their impact on society. Recent studies show that the average magma flux and the time between magma injections into a given magmatic-volcanic system fundamentally control the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, yet these parameters are unknown for many volcanic regions on Earth. We focus on major and trace element chemistry of individual phases and whole-rock samples, initial zircon ID-TIMS analyses, and zircon SIMS oxygen isotope analyses of four caldera-forming ignimbrites from the San Juan caldera cluster in the Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic field, Colorado, to determine the physical and chemical processes leading to large eruptions. We collected outflow samples along stratigraphy of the three caldera-forming ignimbrites of the San Luis caldera complex: the Rat Creek Tuff ( 150 km3), Cebolla Creek Tuff ( 250 km3), and Nelson Mountain Tuff (>500 km3); and we collected samples of both outflow and intracaldera facies of the Snowshoe Mountain Tuff (>500 km3), which formed the Creede caldera. Single-crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages show that these large eruptions occurred in rapid succession between 26.91 Â± 0.02 Ma (Rat Creek Tuff) and 26.87 Â± 0.02 Ma (Snowshoe Mountain Tuff), providing an opportunity to investigate the temporal evolution of magmatic systems feeding large, explosive volcanic eruptions. Major and trace element analyses show that the first and last eruption of the San Luis caldera complex (Rat Creek Tuff and Nelson Mountain Tuff) are rhyolitic to dacitic ignimbrites, whereas the Cebolla Creek Tuff and Snowshoe Mountain Tuff are crystal-rich, dacitic ignimbrites. Trace elements show enrichment in light rare-earth elements (LREEs) over heavy rare-earth elements (HREEs), and whereas the trace element patterns are similar for each caldera cycle, trace element values for each ignimbrite show variability in HREE\n\nIsotopic studies of authigenic sulfides, silicates and carbonates, and calcite and pyrite veinlets in the Creede Formation, San Juan Mountains, Southwest Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBethke, Philip M.; Rye, Robert O.; Finkelstein, David B.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSulfur isotope analysis of authigenic pyrite in the Creede Formation documents its precipitation by the reaction between iron in the volcaniclastic sediments and H2S formed through bacteriogenic reduction of sulfate added to the lake during and immediately following repeated volcanic eruptions during sedimentation. Pyrite veinlets in the underlying Snowshoe Mountain Tuff were formed by the percolation of H2S-bearing pore waters into fractures in the tuff. Conventional analyses of bulk samples of authigenic pyrite range from -20.4% to 34.5% essentially equivalent to the range of -30% to 40% determined using SHRIMP microprobe techniques. Conventional analyses of bulk samples of pyrite from veinlets in the Snowshow Mountain Tiff range from -3.5% to 17.6% much more limited than the ranges of -23% to 111% and -15.6% to 67.0% determined by SHRIMP and laser ablation microbeam techniques, respectively. The extreme range of Î´34S for the veinlets is interpreted to be the result of continued fractionation of the already 34S-depleted pore water. Oxygen isotope analysis of authigenic smectite, kaolinite, and K-feldspar together with fluid-inclusion temperatures and oxygen isotope analysis of calcite coexisting with kaolinite indicate that the smectites formed early during burial diagenesis, in accord with petrographic observations. The 40Ar/39Ar dating of K-feldspar, concorfance of K-feldspar, kaolinite, and calcite Î´18O values, and fluid-inclusion temperatures in calcite, indicate that the sediments at core hole CCM-1 were subjected to a hydrothermal event at 17.6 Ma. The minerals formed oxygen-shifted meteoric waters with Î´18O values of ~-9% Smecities at CCM-1 at least partially exchanged with these waters. Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of authigenic calcites in the Creede Formation show that they formed over a wide range of temperatures from fluids having a wide range of isotopic composition, presumably over an extended period time. Some of the cements apparently\n\nDetermining the physical processes behind four large eruptions in rapid sequence in the San Juan caldera cluster (Colorado, USA)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCurry, Adam; Caricchi, Luca; Lipman, Peter\n\n2017-04-01\n\nLarge, explosive volcanic eruptions can have both immediate and long-term negative effects on human societies. Statistical analyses of volcanic eruptions show that the frequency of the largest eruptions on Earth (> Ë450 km3) differs from that observed for smaller eruptions, suggesting different physical processes leading to eruption. This project will characterize the petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, mineral chemistry, and zircon geochronology of four caldera-forming ignimbrites from the San Juan caldera cluster, Colorado, to determine the physical processes leading to eruption. We collected outflow samples along stratigraphy of the three caldera-forming ignimbrites of the San Luis caldera complex: the Nelson Mountain Tuff (>500 km3), Cebolla Creek Tuff (Ë250 km3), and Rat Creek Tuff (Ë150 km3); and we collected samples of both outflow and intracaldera facies of the Snowshoe Mountain Tuff (>500 km3), which formed the Creede caldera. Single-crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages show that these eruptions occurred in rapid succession between 26.91 Â± 0.02 Ma (Rat Creek) and 26.87 Â± 0.02 Ma (Snowshoe Mountain), providing a unique opportunity to investigate the physical processes leading to a rapid sequence of large, explosive volcanic eruptions. Recent studies show that the average flux of magma is an important parameter in determining the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. High-precision isotope-dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) zircon geochronology will be performed to determine magma fluxes, and cross-correlation of chemical profiles in minerals will be performed to determine the periodicity of magma recharge that preceded these eruptions. Our project intends to combine these findings with similar data from other volcanic regions around the world to identify physical processes controlling the regional and global frequency-magnitude relationships of volcanic eruptions.\n\nStratigraphy, correlation, depositional setting, and geophysical characteristics of the Oligocene Snowshoe Mountain Tuff and Creede Formation in two cored boreholes\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLarsen, Daniel; Nelson, Philip H.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nCore descriptions and geophysical logs from two boreholes (CCM-1 and CCM-2) in the Oligocene Snowshoe Mountain Tuff and Creede Formation, south-central Colorado, are used to interpret sedimentary and volcanic facies associations and their physical properties. The seven facies association include a mixed sequence of intracaldera ash-flow tuffs and breccias, alluvial and lake margin deposits, and tuffaceous lake beds. These deposits represent volcanic units related to caldera collapse and emplacement of the Snowshoe Mountain Tuff, and sediments and pyroclastic material deposited in the newly formed caldera basin, Early sedimentation is interpreted to have been rapid, and to have occurred in volcaniclastic fan environments at CCM-1 and in a variery of volcaniclastic fan, braided stream shallow lacustrine, and mudflat environments at CCM-2. After an initial period of lake-level rise, suspension settling, turbidite, and debris-flow sedimentation occurred in lacustrine slope and basin environments below wave base. Carbonate sedimentation was initially sporadic, but more continuous in the latter part of the recorded lake history (after the H fallout tuff). Sublacustrine-fan deposition occurred at CCM-1 after a pronounced lake-level fall and subsequent rise that preceded the H tuff. Variations in density, neutron, gamma-ray, sonic, and electrical properties of deposits penetrated oin the two holes reflect variations in lithology, porosity, and alteration. Trends in the geophysical properties of the lacustrine strata are linked to downhole changes in authigenic mineralology and a decrease in porosity interpreted to have resulted primarily from diagenesis. Lithological and geophysical characteristics provide a basis for correlation of the cores; however, mineralogical methods of correlation are hampered by the degree of diagenesis and alteration.\n\nSericite from the Silverton caldera, Colorado: correlation among structure, composition, origin, and particle thickness.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nEberl, D.D.; Srodon, J.; Lee, M.; Nadeau, P.H.; Northrop, H.R.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe mineralogy and the origin of a suite of almost pure sericites, collected from fractures in hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks in the vicinity of the Silverton caldera in the western San Juan Mountains of Colorado, USA, are analysed.-J.A.Z.\n\nStructural deformation and sedimentation in an active Caldera, Rabaul, Papua New Guinea\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGreene, H. Gary; Tiffin, D.L.; McKee, C.O.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nRecent seismic and tectonic activity in Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea, suggests that magma is accumulating at a shallow depth beneath this partially submerged structure and that a new volcano may be developing. Changes in onshore elevation since 1971 (as much as 2 m on south Matupit Island) indicate that rapid and large-scale uplifts have occurred on the seafloor near the center of the caldera. The frequency of seismic events within the caldera has also increased during this period. Earthquake locations define an elliptical ring surrounding the center of this uplift within the caldera. A marine geophysical survey in 1982 by the U.S. Geological Survey's R/V \"S.P. Lee\" in Rabaul Caldera shows the development of a bulge in the seafloor near the center of the caldera. High-resolution seismic reflection profiles show that this bulge consists of two domal uplifts bounded and separated by two major north-south-trending fault zones. Deformed sediments overlie these zones; a prominent slump flanks the area of the bulge. Five major acoustic units were identified in the seismic reflection profiles: an acoustic basement and four sedimentary units consisting of irregularly layered, cross-layered, contorted, and well-layered sequences. The acoustic basement is probably composed of crystalline volcanic rocks, and the layered acoustic units are probably sediments, primarily ash deposited in different environments. The cross-layered, irregularly layered, and contorted units appear to have been deposited in a dynamic environment subjected to strong currents, seismicity, and/or mass wasting, while the well-layered units were deposited in a low-energy environment. Locally, well-layered sequences interfinger with the other sedimentary units, indicating a transitional environment that alternated between high-energy and low-energy depositional processes. A submarine channel cuts most of the acoustic units and appears to be the conduit for sediment transport out of the caldera; it\n\nStable isotope evolution and paleolimnology of ancient Lake Creede\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRye, Robert O.; Bethke, Philip M.; Finkelstein, David B.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe lacustrine carbonate and travertine (tufa) deposits of ancient Lake Creede preserve a remarkable record of the isotopic evolution of the lake. That record indicates that the Î´18O of the lake water, and by analogy its salinity, evolved through evaporation. Limited and less reliable data on hydrous minerals and fluid inclusions in early diagenetic carbonates indicate that the Î´D of the lake waters also evolved through evaporation. The isotope data place restrictions on models of the physical limnology of the lake and its evolution.The closed-basin Lake Creede formed shortly after collapse of the 26.9 Ma Creede caldera. Throughout most of its history it occupied the northern three quarters of the moat between the resurgent dome and wall of the caldera. The Creede Formation was deposited in the basin, dominantly as lacustrine sediments. Travertine mounds interfinger with Creede Formation sediments along the inner and outer margins of the lake basin. An estimated one-half of the original thickness of the Creede Formation has been lost mainly to erosion although scattered remnants of the upper portion remain on the caldera walls. Two diamond core holes (CCM-1 and CCM-2) sampled the uneroded portion of the Creede Formation as part of the U.S. Continental Drilling Program. Volcaniclastic material, including tuff units deposited directly into the lake and ash washed in from the watershed, compose the main lithologies of the Creede Formation. These volcaniclastic strata were produced by episodic ring-fracture volcanism.Lacustrine carbonates make up about 15% of the section sampled by drill core. They occur as 1 mm to 2 cm low-Mg calcite laminae alternating with siliciclastic laminae in scattered intervals throughout the preserved section. The carbonate laminae are accumulations of 5â20 Âµm crystallites (microsparites) and brine shrimp fecal pellets (peloids) composed mainly of microsparite particles. Low-Mg calcite also occurs as an early diagenetic replacement of\n\nOccurrence and significance of stalactites within the epithermal deposits at Creede, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCampbell, W.R.; Barton, P.B.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nIn addition to the common and abundant features in karst terranes, stalactites involving a wide variety of minerals have also been found in other settings, including epigenetic mineral deposits, but these are almost always associated with supergene stages. Here we describe a different mode of occurrence from the Creede epithermal ore deposits, in Colorado, wherein stalactites of silica, sphalerite, galena, or pyrite formed in a vapor-dominated setting, below the paleo-water table, and except possibly for pyrite, as part of the hypogene mineralization. Axial cavities may, or may not, be present. No stalagmites have been recognized. The stalactites are small, from a few millimeters to a few centimeters long and a few millimeters in outer diameter. They represent only a small fraction of one percent of the total mineralization, and are covered by later crystals. Their growth orientation usually is unobservable; however, the parallel arrangement of all stalactites in a given specimen, consistency with indicators of gravitational settling, and the common presence of axial structures make the stalactitic interpretation almost unavoidable. In contrast with common carbonate stalactites, the growth mechanism for the sulfide and silica stalactites requires extensive evaporation. Stalactitic forms have also been reported from other deposits, mostly epithermal or Mississippi-Valley-type occurrences, but we caution that stalactite-like features can form by alternative processes.\n\nEruptive and noneruptive calderas, northeastern San Juan Mountains, Colorado: Where did the ignimbrites come from?\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLipman, P.W.; McIntosh, W.C.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe northeastern San Juan Mountains, the least studied portion of this well-known segment of the Southern Rocky Mountains Volcanic Field are the site of several newly identified and reinterpreted ignimbrite calderas. These calderas document some unique eruptive features not described before from large volcanic systems elsewhere, as based on recent mapping, petrologic data, and a large array of newly determined high-precision, laser-fusion 40Ar/39Ar ages (140 samples). Tightly grouped sanidine ages document exceptionally brief durations of 50-100 k.y. or less for individual Oligocene caldera cycles; biotite ages are more variable and commonly as much as several hundred k.y. older than sanidine from the same volcanic unit. A previously unknown ignimbrite caldera at North Pass, along the Continental Divide in the Cochetopa Hills, was the source of the newly distinguished 32.25-Ma Saguache Creek Tuff (???400-500 km3). This regionally, distinctive crystal-poor alkalic rhyolite helps fill an apparent gap in the southwestward migration from older explosive activity, from calderas along the N-S Sawatch locus in central Colorado (youngest, Bonanza Tuff at 33.2 Ma), to the culmination of Tertiary volcanism in the San Juan region, where large-volume ignimbrite eruptions started at ca. 29.5 Ma and peaked with the enormous Fish Canyon Tuff (5000 km3) at 28.0 Ma. The entire North Pass cycle, including caldera-forming Saguache Creek Tuff, thick caldera-filling lavas, and a smaller volume late tuff sheet, is tightly bracketed at 32.25-32.17 Ma. No large ignimbrites were erupted in the interval 32-29 Ma, but a previously unmapped cluster of dacite-rhyolite lava flows and small tuffs, areally associated with a newly recognized intermediate-composition intrusion 5 ?? 10 km across (largest subvolcanic intrusion in San Juan region) centered 15 km north of the North Pass caldera, marks a near-caldera-size silicic system active at 29.8 Ma. In contrast to the completely filled North Pass\n\nEnvironment of ore deposition in the Creede mining district, San Juan Mountains, Colorado; Part IV, source of fluids, from oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon isotope studies\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBethke, P.M.; Rye, R.O.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nalso oxygen shifted meteoric waters but were some 40 per mil lower in deuterium content than the sphalerite and illite/chlorite waters.We propose that the quartz fluids entered the vein system from reservoirs beneath the mountainous areas to the north in the vicinity of the present Continental Divide, but that the sphalerite and illite/chlorite fluids entered the vein system from a topographically low area to the south along the structural moat of the Creede caldera. The difference in delta D between the two meteoric waters may reflect differences in altitude of the recharge areas for the two reservoirs or may be clue to isotopic evolution of the closed-basin lake and interstitial waters in the moat surrounding the Creede caldera.\n\nPRE-ORE POTASSIUM METASOMATISM, CREEDE MINING DISTRICT, COLORADO.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBethke, P.M.; Rye, R.O.; Barton, P.B.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nRhyolitic welded-tuff wallrocks of the epithermal base and precious metal veins of the Creede district were pervasively altered by the addition of more than two billion metric tons of potassium some 1. 5-2 million years before mineralization. Sodium, calcium and magnesium were strongly depleted, yielding a nearly binary quartz plus potassium feldspar assemblage containing as much as 13 weight percent K//2O. This large-scale metasomatism, originally noted by Steven and Rattle (1965), took place progressively by initial alteration of plagioclase phenocrysts to orthoclase or microcline followed by alteration of the groundmass feldspar to orthoclase and gradual change of the sanidine phenocrysts to more Or-rich compositions. Oxygen isotope and chemical studies show that the metasomatism resulted from the interaction of the tuffs with deeply circulating heated ground water and suggest that the potassium metasomatism of rhyolitic rocks is the facies equivalent of propylitization of volcanic rocks of more basic composition.\n\nFluid circulation and structural system of Cerritos Colorados geothermal field in La Primavera volcanic caldera (Mexico) inferred from geophysical surveys\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBolÃ³s, X.; Cifuentes-Nava, G.; Macias, J. L.; Sosa-Ceballos, G.; GarcÃ­a-Tenorio, F.; Albor, M., III; Juarez, M.; Gamez, V.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHydrothermal activity in volcanic calderas is the consequence of energy transfer between deep magmatic chambers and subsurface layers saturated in water. This hydrothermal system is generated by convection of the groundwater supplied by meteoric water recharged and the ascent of hot volcanic gasses exsolved from deep magma reservoirs. Calderas are heterogeneous geological structures that due to their formation and evolution produced a complex stratigraphy. All of these heterogeneities can be affected by deformation and also by the presence of fractures and faults which constitute the main pathways whereby hydrothermal fluids can move easily through the surface as spring discharges and fumarolic activity. Geophysical methods have been used in the last decades to investigate the relationship between structural geology and hydrothermal systems in different volcanic areas around the world. In this work, we have focused on the role of subsurface structures to understand and localize the pathways of fluids related to the hydrothermal system of the Cerritos Colorados geothermal field. We focused in the central area of the caldera (P12 well and Cerritos Colorados graben), where active hydrothermal activity is evidenced by fumaroles, thermal anomalies, CO2 diffuse emission, and sulfur precipitation. We have applied a self-potential method (SP) that combined with temperature measurements that allowed to identify the main infiltration and ascending fluid zones in the area, and their specific surface temperature coinciding with fumarolic activity. From this data we an applied Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) survey in two selected places. One ERT profile (1.2 km in length) was located in the P12 well area. A 3D resistivity model used with the equatorial method was carried out on the Cerritos Colorados graben area. Combining the results of the SP, TÂºC, and ERT data with a detailed structural map we identified the main degassing zones (i.e. fumaroles) that correspond to\n\nFluid-inclusion data on samples from Creede, Colorado, in relation to mineral paragenesis\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWoods, T.L.; Roedder, Edwin; Bethke, P.M.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nPublished and unpublished data on 2575 fluid inclusions in ore and gangue minerals from the Creede, Colorado, Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu vein deposit collected in our laboratories from 1959 to 1981 have shown that the average salinity (wt. % NaCl equivalent, hereinafter termed wt.% eq.) and homogenization temperature (Th), and the ranges of these two parameters for fluid inclusions in sphalerite, quartz, fluorite, and rhodochrosite, respectively, are 8.1 (4.6 - 13.4), 239?C (195-274?C); 6.1 (1.1-10.0), 260?C (190->400?C); 10.7 (6.1-11.1), 217?C (213-229?C) and 260?C (247-268?C) (bimodal distribution of Th); and 9.9 (9.3 - 10.6), 214?C (185-249?C). Inclusions have been measured in minerals from four of the five stages of mineralization previously recognized at Creede. The few inclusions of fluids depositing rhodochrosite (A-stage, earliest in the paragenesis) yield Th and salinity values more similar to those of the low-temperature (average Th 217?C) fluids forming some of the much later fluorite (C-stage) than to any of the other fluids. Th measurements on A-stage quartz range from 192?C to 263?C and average 237?C. The early, fine-grained, B-stage sphalerites yielded Th of 214 to 241?C and salinities of 6.1 to 10.2 wt. % eq. D-stage sphalerite (late in the paragenesis) has been studied in detail (growth-zone by growth-zone) for several localities along the OH vein and reveals a generally positive correlation among Th, salinity and iron content of the host sphalerite. The deposition of D-stage sphalerite was characterized by repeated cycling through different regions of salinity/Th space, as Th and salinity generally decreased with time. Seventeen salinity-Th measurements were made on D-stage sphalerite from one locality on the Bulldog Mountain vein system, which, like the OH vein, is one of four major ore-producing vein systems at Creede. These data suggest a lower Th for a given salinity fluid from sphalerite on the Bulldog Mountain vein than on the OH vein.

Within a few years, subaerial deposits infilled the phreatic craters and then formed a thick wedge (10-20 m) of mass flow deposits shed from caldera walls. Intense volcanic activity (phreatic explosions, subaerial flows, and hydrothermal venting) occurred during this early postcaldera stage, and a central platform of subaerial andesite flows and scoria formed on the caldera floor.Radiocarbon ages suggest that deposition of Iacustrine hemipelagic sediment began on the central platform about 150 yr after the caldera collapse. This is the minimum time to fill the lake halfway with water and cover the platform assuming present hydrologic conditions of precipitation and evaporation but with negligible leakage of lake water. Wizard Island formed during the final part of the 300-yr lake-filling period as shown by its (1) upper subaerial lava flows from 0 to -70 m below present water level and lower subaqueous lava flows from -70 to -500 m and by (2) lacustrine turbidite sand derived from Wizard Island that was deposited on the central platform about 350 yr after the caldera collapse. Pollen stratigraphy indicates that the warm and dry climate of middle Holocene time correlates with the early lake deposits. Diatom stratigraphy also suggests a more thermally stratified and phosphate-rich environment associated respectively with this climate and greater hydrothermal activity during the early lake history.Apparent coarse-grained and thick-bedded turbidites of the early lake beds were deposited throughout northwest, southwest, and eastern basins during the time that volcanic and seismic activity formed the subaqueous Wizard Island, Merriam Cone, and rhyodacite dome. The last known postcaldera volcanic activity produced a subaqueous rhyodacite\n\nConstraining Resurgence through Lake Sediment Paleomagnetism on Resurgent Dome Samosir Island in Toba Caldera, Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSolada, K.; de Silva, S. L.; Stoner, J. S.; Mucek, A. E.; Reilly, B. T.; Hatfield, R. G.; Pratomo, I.; Bowers, J.; Jamil, R.; Setianto, B.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAround 74 ka, a supervolcano, Toba Caldera in Sumatra, Indonesia erupted, producing the Youngest Toba Tuff and its associated caldera. After this catastrophic eruption, a lake filled the caldera, sedimentation within the lake occurred, and the process known as resurgence began. Today, the resurgent dome, Samosir Island, is uplifted 700 m above the lake with the upper 100 m composed of these post eruption lake sediments. These sediments and their ages offer insight to the resurgent uplift history. To constrain sediment chronology, we collected discrete paleomagnetic 8 cm3 cubes and 43 radiocarbon samples from 10 sites around the island. Bulk organic carbon 14C ages provide an initial chronostratigraphic framework, which is improved by correlating paleomagnetic signals between site sections. Additionally, nearby marine sediment paleomagnetic records show large amplitude changes in inclination over the past 74 ka, providing a good template to compare the sediment chronology. 27 radiocarbon samples have already been dated, with the oldest dating at 38 ka. However, our radiocarbon and paleomagnetic correlation suggest that this record extends even older. Natural and laboratory magnetizations on discrete samples were studied using alternating field (AF) demagnetization at the Oregon State University P-Mag Lab. Although there is variability in magnetic susceptibility between study sites and natural remanant magnetization intensities are often relatively low ( 10-4 (A/m)), AF demagnetization behavior suggests a primary magnetization is recorded. Characteristic remanent magnetizations are reasonably well-defined using a principal component analysis with maximum angular deviation values < 15Â°, though stronger samples typically have better resolved magnetizations. Data from 4 sites with 14C ages ranging from 23 ka to 38 ka, show low inclination values, averaging around -5Â° compared with geocentric axial dipole prediction for the site location of approximately 4Â°.

Islamic creed has been regarded as the root of Islam; thus, it should be the fundamental composition of Islamic counselling. The objectives of this review are to demonstrate the relationship between counselling and Islamic creed and to establish a guideline for the practitioners of Islamic counselling when consulting with their clients in matters related to creed. The review was conducted by suggesting methods to incorporate Islamic creed into three stages of counselling process. The major references for this review were the verses in the QurÄn, the Prophet Tradition (hadith) and literatures on Islamic counselling. This review revealed that there is a strong relationship between counselling and Islamic creed and there are six aspects of Islamic creed associated to counselling that should be observed by the Islamic counselling practitioners.\n\nGeologic map of the central San Juan caldera cluster, southwestern Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLipman, Peter W.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe San Juan Mountains are the largest erosional remnant of a composite volcanic field that covered much of the southern Rocky Mountains in middle Tertiary time. The San Juan field consists mainly of intermediate-composition lavas and breccias, erupted about 35-30 Ma from scattered central volcanoes (Conejos Formation) and overlain by voluminous ash-flow sheets erupted from caldera sources. In the central San Juan Mountains, eruption of at least 8,800 km3 of dacitic-rhyolitic magma as nine major ash flow sheets (individually 150-5,000 km3) was accompanied by recurrent caldera subsidence between 28.3 Ma and about 26.5 Ma. Voluminous andesitic-dacitic lavas and breccias erupted from central volcanoes prior to the ash-flow eruptions, and similar lava eruptions continued within and adjacent to the calderas during the period of more silicic explosive volcanism. Exposed calderas vary in size from 10 to 75 km in maximum dimension; the largest calderas are associated with the most voluminous eruptions.\n\nDating of Pliocene Colorado River sediments: implications for cosmogenic burial dating and the evolution of the lower Colorado River\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMatmon, Ari; Stock, Greg M.; Granger, Darryl E.; Howard, Keith A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe applied cosmogenic 26Al/10Be burial dating to sedimentary deposits of the ancestral Colorado River. We compared cosmogenic burial ages of sediments to the age of an independently well-dated overlying basalt flow at one site, and also applied cosmogenic burial dating to sediments with less precise independent age constraints. All dated gravels yielded old ages that suggest several episodes of sediment burial over the past â¼5.3 m.y. Comparison of burial ages to the overlying 4.4 Ma basalt yielded good agreement and suggests that under the most favorable conditions, cosmogenic burial dating can extend back 4â5 m.y. In contrast, results from other sites with more broadly independent age constraints highlight the complexities inherent in burial dating; these complexities arise from unknown and complicated burial histories, insufficient shielding, postburial production of cosmogenic isotopes by muons, and unknown initial 26Al/10Be ratios. Nevertheless, and in spite of the large range of burial ages and large uncertainties, we identify samples that provide reasonable burial age constraints on the depositional history of sediment along the lower ancestral Colorado River. These samples suggest possible sediment deposition and burial at ca. 5.3, 4.7, and 3.6 Ma.

In contrast to the nested loci for successive ignimbrite eruptions at many large multicyclic calderas elsewhere, Bonanza caldera is an areally isolated structure that formed in response to a single ignimbrite eruption. The adjacent Marshall caldera, the nonresurgent lava-filled source for the 33.9-Ma Thorn Ranch Tuff, is the immediate precursor for Bonanza, but projected structural boundaries of two calderas are largely or entirely separate even though the western topographic rim of Bonanza impinges on the older caldera. Bonanza, source of a compositionally complex regional ignimbrite sheet erupted at 33.12 Â± 0.03 Ma, is a much larger caldera system than previously recognized. It is a subequant structure â¼20 km in diameter that subsided at least 3.5 km during explosive eruption of â¼1000 km3 of magma, then resurgently domed its floor a similar distance vertically. Among its features: (1) varied exposure levels of an intact caldera due to rugged present-day topographyâfrom Paleozoic and Precambrian basement rocks that are intruded by resurgent plutons, upward through precaldera volcanic floor, to a single thickly ponded intracaldera ignimbrite (Bonanza Tuff), interleaved landslide breccia, and overlying postcollapse lavas; (2) large compositional gradients in the Bonanza ignimbrite (silicic andesite to rhyolite ignimbrite; 60%â76% SiO2); (3) multiple alternations of mafic and silicic zones within a single ignimbrite, rather than simple upward gradation to more mafic compositions; (4) compositional contrasts between outflow sectors of the ignimbrite (mainly crystal-poor rhyolite to east, crystal-rich dacite to west); (5) similarly large compositional diversity among postcollapse caldera-fill lavas and resurgent\n\nBeyond Colorado's Front Range - A new look at Laramide basin subsidence, sedimentation, and deformation in north-central Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCole, James C.; Trexler, James H.; Cashman, Patricia H.; Miller, Ian M.; Shroba, Ralph R.; Cosca, Michael A.; Workman, Jeremiah B.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis field trip highlights recent research into the Laramide uplift, erosion, and sedimentation on the western side of the northern Colorado Front Range. The Laramide history of the North Park?Middle Park basin (designated the Colorado Headwaters Basin in this paper) is distinctly different from that of the Denver basin on the eastern flank of the range. The Denver basin stratigraphy records the transition from Late Cretaceous marine shale to recessional shoreline sandstones to continental, fluvial, marsh, and coal mires environments, followed by orogenic sediments that span the K-T boundary. Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene strata in the Denver basin consist of two mega-fan complexes that are separated by a 9 million-year interval of erosion/non-deposition between about 63 and 54 Ma. In contrast, the marine shale unit on the western flank of the Front Range was deeply eroded over most of the area of the Colorado Headwaters Basin (approximately one km removed) prior to any orogenic sediment accumulation. New 40Ar-39Ar ages indicate the oldest sediments on the western flank of the Front Range were as young as about 61 Ma. They comprise the Windy Gap Volcanic Member of the Middle Park Formation, which consists of coarse, immature volcanic conglomerates derived from nearby alkalic-mafic volcanic edifices that were forming at about 65?61 Ma. Clasts of Proterozoic granite, pegmatite, and gneiss (eroded from the uplifted core of the Front Range) seem to arrive in the Colorado Headwaters Basin at different times in different places, but they become dominant in arkosic sandstones and conglomerates about one km above the base of the Colorado Headwaters Basin section. Paleocurrent trends suggest the southern end of the Colorado Headwaters Basin was structurally closed because all fluvial deposits show a northward component of transport. Lacustrine depositional environments are indicated by various sedimentological features in several sections within the >3 km of sediment\n\nLead isotope compositions as guides to early gold mineralization: The North Amethyst vein system, Creede district, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFoley, Nora K.; Ayuso, Robert A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nPb isotope compositions from the late stage of the North Amethyst vein system and from the Bondholder and central and southern Creede mining districts are more radiogenic than the host volcanic rocks of the central cluster of the San Juan volcanic field. Our Pb isotope results indicate that early Au mineralization of the North Amethyst area may represent the product of an older and relatively local hydrothermal system distinct from that of the younger base metal and Ag mineralization found throughout the region. Fluids that deposited Au minerals may have derived their Pb isotope composition by a greater degree of interaction with shallow, relatively less radiogenic volcanic wall rocks. The younger, base metal and Ag-rich mineralization that overprints the Au mineralization in the North Amethyst area clearly has a more radiogenic isotopic signature, which implies that the later mineralization derived a greater component of its Pb from Proterozoic source rocks, or sediments derived from them.Paragenetically early sulfide-rich vein assemblages have the least radiogenic galenas and generally also have the highest Au contents. Thus, identification of paragenetically early vein assemblages with relatively unradiogenic Pb isotope compositions similar to those of the North Amethyst area provides an additional exploration tool for Au in the central San Juan Mountains area.\n\nMineralogy, paragenesis, and mineral zoning of the Bulldog Mountain vein system, Creede District, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPlumlee, Geoffrey S.; Heald Whitehouse-Veaux, Pamela\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe Bulldog Mountain vein system, Creede district, Colorado, is one of four major epithermal vein systems from which the bulk of the district's historical Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu production has come. Ores deposited along the vein system were discovered in 1965 and were mined from 1969 to 1985.Six temporally gradational mineralization stages have been identified along the Bulldog Mountain vein system, each with a characteristic suite of minerals deposited or leached and a characteristic distribution within the vein system; some of these stages are also strongly zoned within the vein system. Stage A was dominated by deposition of rhodochrosite along the lower levels of the Bulldog Mountain ore zone. Stage B in the northern parts of the ore zone is characterized by abundant fine-grained sphalerite and galena, with lesser tetrahedrite and minor chlorite and hematite. With increasing elevation to the south, stage B ores become progressively more barite and silver rich, with alternating barite and fine-grained sphalerite + galena generations; native silver + or - acanthite assemblages are also locally abundant within southern stage B barite sulfide ores, whereas chalcopyrite and other Cu and Ag sulfides and sulfosalts are present erratically in minor amounts. Stage C in the upper and northern portions of the ore zone is characterized by abundant quartz and fluorite, minor adularia, hematite, Mn siderite, sphalerite, and galena, and major leaching of earlier barite; to the south, some barite and sulfides may have been deposited. Stage D sphalerite and galena were deposited in the upper and northern portions of the ore zone; a barite- and silver-rich facies of this stage may also be present in the southern portions of the vein system. Late in stage D, mineralogically complex assemblages containing chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, polybasite, bornite, pyrargyrite, and a variety of other sulfides and sulfosalts were deposited in modest amounts throughout the vein system.

W.; Kelly, S.; Ferguson, J. F.; McPhee, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn 2016, the Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) program, in cooperation with the National Park Service, began a multi-year investigation into the structure and evolution of the Valles Caldera in northern New Mexico. The Valles Caldera is a 20-km wide topographic depression in the Jemez Mountains volcanic complex that formed during two massive ignimbrite eruptions at 1.65 and 1.26 Ma. Post-collapse volcanic activity in the caldera includes the rise of Redondo peak, a 1 km high resurgent dome, periodic eruptions of the Valles rhyolite along an inferred ring fracture zone, and the presence of a geothermal reservoir beneath the western caldera with temperatures in excess of 300Â°C at a mere 2 km depth. Broad sediment-filled valleys associated with lava-dammed Pleistocene lakes occupy much of the northern and southeastern caldera. SAGE activities to date have included collection of new gravity data (>120 stations) throughout the caldera, a transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey of Valle Grande, reprocessing of industrial magnetotelluric (MT) data collected in the 1980s, and new MT data collection both within and outside of the caldera. Gravity modeling provides constraints on the pre-Caldera structure, estimates of the thickness of Caldera fill, and reveals regional structural trends reflected in the geometry of post-Caldera collapse. At a more local scale, TEM-derived resistivity models image rhyolite flows radiating outward from nearby vents into the lacustrine sediments filling Valle Grande. Resistivity models along a 6-km long profile also provide hints of structural dismemberment along the inferred Valles and Toledo ring fracture zones. Preliminary MT modeling at the caldera scale reveals conductive caldera fill, the resistive crystalline basement, and an enigmatic mid-crustal conductor likely related to magmatic activity that post-dates caldera formation.\n\nPrediction of suspended-sediment concentrations at selected sites in the Fountain Creek watershed, Colorado, 2008-09\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStogner, Sr., Robert W.; Nelson, Jonathan M.; McDonald, Richard R.; Kinzel, Paul J.; Mau, David P.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments, Colorado Water Conservation Board, Colorado Springs City Engineering, and the Lower Arkansas Valley Water Conservancy District, began a small-scale pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a computational model of streamflow and suspended-sediment transport for predicting suspended-sediment concentrations and loads in the Fountain Creek watershed in Colorado. Increased erosion and sedimentation damage have been identified by the Fountain Creek Watershed Plan as key problems within the watershed. A recommendation in the Fountain Creek Watershed plan for management of the basin is to establish measurable criteria to determine if progress in reducing erosion and sedimentation damage is being made. The major objective of this study was to test a computational method to predict local suspended-sediment loads at two sites with different geomorphic characteristics in order to evaluate the feasibility of using such an approach to predict local suspended-sediment loads throughout the entire watershed. Detailed topographic surveys, particle-size data, and suspended-sediment samples were collected at two gaged sites: Monument Creek above Woodmen Road at Colorado Springs, Colorado (USGS gage 07103970), and Sand Creek above mouth at Colorado Springs, Colorado (USGS gage 07105600). These data were used to construct three-dimensional computational models of relatively short channel reaches at each site. The streamflow component of these models predicted a spatially distributed field of water-surface elevation, water velocity, and bed shear stress for a range of stream discharges. Using the model predictions, along with measured particle sizes, the sediment-transport component of the model predicted the suspended-sediment concentration throughout the reach of interest. These computed concentrations were used with predicted flow patterns and channel morphology to\n\nZeolite-clay mineral zonation of volcaniclastic sediments within the McDermitt caldera complex of Nevada and Oregon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGlanzman, Richard K.; Rytuba, James J.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nVolcaniclastic sediments deposited in the moat of the collapsed McDermitt caldera complex have been altered chiefly to zeolites and potassium feldspar. The original rhyolitic and peralkaline ash-flow tuffs are included in conglomerates at the caldera rims and grade into a lacustrine series near the center of the collapse. The tuffs show a lateral zeolitic alteration from almost fresh glass to clinoptilolite, clinoptilolite-mordenite, and erionite; to analcime-potassium feldspar; and finally to potassium feldspar. Vertical zonation is in approximately the same order. Clay minerals in associated mudstones, on the other hand, show little lateral variation but a distinct vertical zonation, having a basal dioctahedral smectite, a medial trioctahedral smectite, and an upper dioctahedral smectite. The medial trioctahedral smectite is enriched in lithium (as much as 6,800 ppm Li). Hydrothermal alteration of the volcaniclastic sediments, forming both mercury and uranium deposits, caused a distinct zeolite and clay-mineral zonation within the general lateral zonation. The center of alteration is generally potassium feldspar, commonly associated with alunite. Potassium feldspar grades laterally and vertically to either clinoptilolite or clinoptilolite-mordenite, generally associated with gypsum. This zone then grades vertically and laterally into fresh glass. The clay minerals are a dioctahedral smectite, a mixed-layer clay mineral, and a 7-A clay mineral. The mixed-layer and 7-A clay minerals are associated with the potassium feldspar-alunite zone of alteration, and the dioctahedral smectite is associated with clinoptilolite. This mineralogical zonation may be an exploration guide for mercury and uranium mineralization in the caldera complex environment.\n\nHigh-resolution 40Ar 39Ar chronology of Oligocene volcanic rocks, San Juan Mountains, Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLanphere, M.A.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe central San Juan caldera complex consists of seven calderas from which eight major ash-flow tuffs were erupted during a period of intense volcanic activity that lasted for approximately 2 m.y. about 26-28 Ma. The analytical precision of conventional K-Ar dating in this time interval is not sufficient to unambiguously resolve this complex history. However, 40Ar 39Ar incremental-heating experiments provide data for a high-resolution chronology that is consistent with stratigraphie relations. Weighted-mean age-spectrum plateau ages of biotite and sanidine are the most precise with standard deviations ranging from 0.08 to 0.21 m.y. The pooled estimate of standard deviation for the plateau ages of 12 minerals is about 0.5 percent or about 125,000 to 135,000 years. Age measurements on coexisting minerals from one tuff and on two samples of each of two other tuffs indicate that a precision in the age of a tuff of better than 100,000 years can be achieved at 27 Ma. New data indicate that the San Luis caldera is the youngest caldera in the central complex, not the Creede caldera as previously thought. ?? 1988.\n\nCalderas and caldera structures: a review\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCole, J. W.; Milner, D. M.; Spinks, K. D.\n\n2005-02-01\n\nCalderas are important features in all volcanic environments and are commonly the sites of geothermal activity and mineralisation. Yet, it is only in the last 25 years that a thorough three-dimensional study of calderas has been carried out, utilising studies of eroded calderas, geophysical analysis of their structures and analogue modelling of caldera formation. As more data has become available on calderas, their individuality has become apparent. A distinction between 'caldera', 'caldera complex', 'cauldron', and 'ring structure' is necessary, and new definitions are given in this paper. Descriptions of calderas, based on dominant composition of eruptives (basaltic, peralkaline, andesitic-dacitic, rhyolitic) can be used, and characteristics of each broad group are given. Styles of eruption may be effusive or explosive, with the former dominant in basaltic calderas, and the latter dominant in andesitic-dacitic, rhyolitic and peralkaline calderas. Four 'end-member' collapse styles occurâplate or piston, piecemeal, trapdoor, and downsagâbut many calderas have multiple styles. Features of so-called 'funnel' and 'chaotic' calderas proposed in the literature can be explained by other collapse styles and the terms are considered unnecessary. Ground deformation comprises subsidence or collapse (essential characteristics of a caldera) and uplifting/doming and fracturing due to tumescence and/or resurgence (frequent, but not essential). Collapse may occur on pre-existing structures, such as regional faults or on faults created during the caldera formation, and the shape of the collapse area will be influenced by depth, size and shape of the magma chamber. The final morphology of a caldera will depend on how the caldera floor breaks up; whether collapse takes place in one event or multiple events, whether vertical movement is spasmodic or continuous throughout the eruptive sequence, and whether blocks subside uniformly or chaotically at one or more collapse centres.

Dendrochronology, field mapping, and aerial photographic analysis are used to evaluate whether a 19th century earthen, water-conveyance ditch has altered the regime of debris flow occurrence in the Colorado River headwaters. Identifying any shifts in disturbance processes or changes in magnitudes and frequencies of occurrence is fundamental to establishing the historical range of variability (HRV) at the site. We found no substantial difference in frequency of debris flows cataloged at eleven sites of deposition between the east (8) and west (11) sides of the Colorado River valley over the last century, but four of the five largest debris flows originated on the west side of the valley in association with the earthen ditch, while the fifth is on a steep hillslope of hydrothermally altered rock on the east side. These results suggest that the ditch has altered the regime of debris flow activity in the Colorado River headwaters as compared to HRV by increasing the frequency of debris flows large enough to reach the Colorado River valley. Valley confinement is a dominant control on response to debris flows, influencing volumes of aggradation and persistence of debris flow deposits. Large, frequent debris flows, exceeding HRV, create persistent effects due to valley geometry and geomorphic setting conducive to sediment storage that are easily delineated by valley confinement ratios which are useful to land managers.\n\nDebris Flow Occurrence and Sediment Persistence, Upper Colorado River Valley, CO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrimsley, K.

Potentially cohesive sediment samples were collected from deposits in the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons. The erosion velocities of these samples were measured in a laboratory flume under varying boundary shear stresses. The non-dimensional boundary shear stress at which erosion commenced showed a systematic deviation from that of non-cohesive sediments at mud fractions greater than 0.2. An empirical relation for the boundary shear stress threshold of erosion as a function of mud fraction was proposed. The mass erosion rate was modelled using the Ariathurai-Partheniades equation. The erosion rate parameter of this equation was found to be a strong function of mud fraction. Under similar boundary shear stress and sediment supply conditions in the Colorado River, cohesive lateral eddy deposits formed of mud fractions in excess of 0.2 will erode less rapidly than non-cohesive deposits.

Altitudes in the basin range from 12,480 feet near the headwaters to 4,090 feet at station 09180500. The average annual precipitation for 1894-1982 near the station was 7.94 inches. The average annual precipitation near the headwaters often exceeds 50 inches. Rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Holocene are exposed in the drainage basin upstream from station 09180500. Shale, limestone, siltstone, mudstone, and sandstone probably are the most easily eroded rocks in the basin, and they contribute large quantities of sediment to the Colorado River. During 1930-82, the U.S. Geological Survey collected records of fluvial sediment at station 09180500. Based on these records, the mean annual suspended-sediment load was 11,390,000 tone, ranging from 2,038,000 tons in water year 1981 to 35,700,000 tons in water year 1938. The minimum daily load of 14 tons was on August 22, 1960, and the maximum daily load of 2,790,000 tons was on October 14, 1941.

M.; Parnell, R.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nCurrent drought conditions in the southwest United States have resulted in lowering water levels in Lake Powell, Utah. Delta sediments forming at the Colorado River inflow for the past 39 years are becoming exposed and reworked as lake levels continue to fall to over 22 meters below full pool level. Fine sediments act as a sink for pollutants by adsorbing contaminants to their surfaces. Reworking these sediments may pose a risk to water quality in the lake. We examine whether burial and time have sufficiently altered fine sediments in the delta and affected materials adsorbed on their surfaces. Fifteen lake cores and six sediment traps were collected from the sediment delta forming at the Colorado River inflow in Lake Powell. This research characterizes fine sediment mineralogy, the composition of exchangeable materials, and organic matter content within delta sediments to determine the type and amount of alteration of these sediments with cycles of burial and resuspension. We hypothesize that as sediments are reworked, organic carbon is degraded and organic nitrogen is released forming ammonium in these reducing conditions. Sediment trap samples will be used to test this hypothesis. Trap samples will be compared to subsamples from sediment cores to determine the amount of alteration of fine sediments. All samples are analyzed for organic carbon, organic nitrogen, ammonium, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cation composition, and clay mineralogy. Organic carbon and nitrogen are analyzed using a Leco CN analyzer. Ammonium is analyzed using a Lachet ion chromatograph. Clay mineralogy is characterized using a Siemens D500 powder X-ray diffractometer. Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations are measured using standard soil chemical techniques. Clay mineral analyses indicate significant spatial and temporal differences in fine sediment entering the Lake Powell delta which complicates the use of a simple deposition/alteration/resuspension model using a\n\nApplication of sediment characteristics and transport conditions to resource management in selected main-stem reaches of the Upper Colorado River, Colorado and Utah, 1965-2007\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWilliams, Cory A.; Schaffrath, Keelin R.; Elliott, John G.; Richards, Rodney J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Colorado River Basin provides habitat for 14 native fish, including 4 endangered species protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. These endangered fish species once thrived in the Colorado River system, but water-resource development, including the building of numerous diversion dams and several large reservoirs, and the introduction of non-native fish, resulted in large reductions in the numbers and range of the four species through loss of habitat and stream function. Understanding how stream conditions and habitat change in response to alterations in streamflow is important for water administrators and wildlife managers and can be determined from an understanding of sediment transport. Characterization of the processes that are controlling sediment transport is an important first step in identifying flow regimes needed for restored channel morphology and the sustained recovery of endangered fishes within these river systems. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Argonne National Laboratory, Western Area Power Administration, and Wyoming State Engineerâs Office, began a study in 2004 to characterize sediment transport at selected locations on the Colorado, Gunnison, and Green Rivers to begin addressing gaps in existing datasets and conceptual models of the river systems. This report identifies and characterizes the relation between streamflow (magnitude and timing) and sediment transport and presents the findings through discussions of (1) suspended-sediment transport, (2) incipient motion of streambed material, and (3) a case study of sediment-transport conditions for a reach of the Green River identified as a razorback sucker spawning habitat (See report for full abstract).\n\nColorado River sediment transport: 1. Natural sediment supply limitation and the influence of Glen Canyon Dam\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTopping, David J.; Rubin, David M.; Vierra, L.E.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAnalyses of flow, sedimentâtransport, bedâtopographic, and sedimentologic data suggest that before the closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons was annually supplyâlimited with respect to fine sediment (i.e., sand and finer material). Furthermore, these analyses suggest that the predam river in Glen Canyon was not supplyâlimited to the same degree and that the degree of annual supply limitation increased near the head of Marble Canyon. The predam Colorado River in Grand Canyon displays evidence of four effects of supply limitation: (1) seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (2) seasonal hysteresis in sediment grain size coupled to the seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (3) production of inversely graded flood deposits, and (4â¥ development or modification of a lag between the time of a flood peak and the time of either maximum or minimum (depending on reach geometry) bed elevation. Analyses of sediment budgets provide additional support for the interpretation that the predam river was annually supplyâlimited with respect to fine sediment, but it was not supplyâlimited with respect to fine sediment during all seasons. In the average predam year, sand would accumulate and be stored in Marble Canyon and upper Grand Canyon for 9 months of the year (from July through March) when flows were dominantly below 200â300 m3/s; this stored sand was then eroded during April through June when flows were typically higher. After closure of Glen Canyon Dam, because of the large magnitudes of the uncertainties in the sediment budget, no season of substantial sand accumulation is evident. Because most flows in the postdam river exceed 200â300 m3/s, substantial sand accumulation in the postdam river is unlikely.\n\nLithium deposits hosted in intracontinental rhyolite calderas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenson, T. R.; Coble, M. A.; Mahood, G. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nLithium (Li) is classified as a technology-critical element due to the increasing demand for Li-ion batteries, which have a high power density and a relatively low cost that make them optimal for energy storage in mobile electronics, the electrical power grid, and hybrid and electric vehicles. Given that many projections for Li demand exceed current economic reserves and the market is dominated by Australia and Chile, discovery of new domestic Li resources will help diversify the supply chain and keep future technology costs down. Here we show that lake sediments preserved within intracontinental rhyolite calderas have the potential to host Li deposits on par with some of the largest Li brine deposits in the world. We compare Li concentrations of rhyolite magmas formed in a variety of tectonic settings using in situ SHRIMP-RG measurements of homogenized quartz-hosted melt inclusions. Rhyolite magmas that formed within thick, felsic continental crust (e.g., Yellowstone and Hideaway Park, United States) display moderate to extreme Li enrichment (1,500 - 9,000 ppm), whereas magmas formed in thin crust or crust comprised of accreted arc terranes (e.g., Pantelleria, Italy and High Rock, Nevada) contain Li concentrations less than 500 ppm. When the Li-enriched magmas erupt to form calderas, the cauldron depression serves as an ideal catchment within which meteoric water that leached Li from intracaldera ignimbrite, nearby outflow ignimbrite, and caldera-related lavas can accumulate. Additional Li is concentrated in the system through near-neutral, low-temperature hydrothermal fluids circulated along ring fractures as remnant magma solidifies and degasses. Li-bearing hectorite and illite clays form in this alteration zone, and when preserved in the geological record, can lead to a large Li deposit like the 2 Mt Kings Valley Li deposit in the McDermitt Caldera, Nevada. Because more than 100 large Cenozoic calderas occur in the western United States that formed on eruption\n\nLaramide basin CSI: Comprehensive stratigraphic investigations of Paleogene sediments in the Colorado Headwaters Basin, north-central Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDechesne, Marieke; Cole, James Channing; Trexler, James H.; Cashman, Patricia; Peterson, Christopher D\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Paleogene sedimentary deposits of the Colorado Headwaters Basin provide a detailed proxy record of regional deformation and basin subsidence during the Laramide orogeny in north-central Colorado and southern Wyoming. This field trip presents extensive evidence from sedimentology, stratigraphy, structure, palynology, and isotope geochronology that shows a complex history that is markedly different from other Laramide synorogenic basins in the vicinity.We show that the basin area was deformed by faulting and folding before, during, and after deposition of the Paleogene rocks. Internal unconformities have been identified that further reflect the interaction of deformation, subsidence, and sedimentation. Uplift of Proterozoic basement blocks that make up the surrounding mountain ranges today occurred late in basin history. Evidence is given to reinterpret the Independence Mountain uplift as the result of significant normal faulting (not thrusting), probably in middle Tertiary time.While the Denver and Cheyenne Basins to the east were subsiding and accumulating sediment during Late Cretaceous time, the Colorado Headwaters Basin region was experiencing vertical uplift and erosion. At least 1200 m of the upper part of the marine Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale was regionally removed, along with Fox Hills Sandstone shoreline deposits of the receding Interior Seaway as well as any Laramie Formationâtype continental deposits. Subsidence did not begin in the Colorado Headwaters Basin until after 60.5 Ma, when coarse, chaotic, debris-flow deposits of the Paleocene Windy Gap Volcanic Member of the Middle Park Formation began to accumulate along the southern basin margin. These volcaniclastic conglomerate deposits were derived from local, mafic-alkalic volcanic sources (and transitory deposits in the drainage basin), and were rapidly transported into a deep lake system by sediment gravity currents. The southern part of the basin subsided rapidly (roughly 750â1000 m\n\nWater-quality assessment of the Rio Grande Valley, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; organic compounds and trace elements in bed sediment and fish tissue, 1992-93\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCarter, L.F.; Anderholm, S.K.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe occurrence and distribution of contaminants in aquatic systems are major components of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. Bed-sediment samples were collected at 18 sites in the Rio Grande Valley study unit between September 1992 and March 1993 to characterize the geographic distribution of organic compounds, including chlorinated insecticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, and also trace elements. Two-millimeter-size- fraction sediment was analyzed for organic compounds and less than 63-micron-size-fraction sediment was analyzed for trace elements. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE were detected in 33 percent of the bed-sediment samples. With the exception of DDT-related compounds, no other organochlorine insecticides or polychlorinated biphenyls were detected in samples of bed sediment. Whole-body fish samples were collected at 11 of the bed- sediment sites and analyzed for organic compounds. Organic compounds were reported more frequently in samples of fish, and more types of organic compounds were found in whole-body fish samples than in bed-sediment samples. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE were detected in 91 percent of whole-body fish samples. Polychlorinated biphenyls, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, trans- nonachlor, and hexachlorobenzene were other organic compounds detected in whole-body samples of fish from at least one site. Because of the extent of mineralized areas in the Rio Grande Basin arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc concentrations in bed-sediment samples could represent natural conditions at most sites. However, a combination of natural conditions and human activities appears to be associated with elevated trace-element concentrations in the bed-sediment sample from the site Rio Grande near Creede, Colorado, because this sample exceeded the background trace-element concentrations calculated for this study. Fish-liver samples were collected at 12 of the bed-sediment\n\nThe isotopic composition of ore lead of the Creede mining district and vicinity, San Juan Mountains, Colorado: Text of a talk presented at the San Juan Mountains symposium to honor Thomas A.

This interpretation implies importation, deep within the Creede hydrologic system, of fluids from remote sources. These alternatives show that the Pbisotope systematics may have a profound impact on the interpretation of the Creede hydrothermal system, and that further study is warranted.\n\nImpacts on water quality and biota from natural acid rock drainage in Colorado's Lake Creek watershed\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBird, D.A.; Sares, Matthew A.; Policky, Greg A.; Schmidt, Travis S.; Church, Stan E.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nColorado's Lake Creek watershed hosts natural acid rock drainage that significantly impacts surface water, streambed sediment, and aquatic life. The source of the ARD is a group of iron-rich springs that emerge from intensely hydrothermally altered, unexploited, low-grade porphyry copper mineralization in the Grizzly Peak Caldera. Source water chemistry includes pH of 2.5 and dissolved metal concentrations of up to 277 mg/L aluminum, 498 mg/L iron, and 10 mg/L copper. From the hydrothermally altered area downstream for 27 kilometers to Twin Lakes Reservoir, metal concentrations in streambed sediment are elevated and the watershed experiences locally severe adverse impacts to aquatic life due to the acidic, metal-laden water. The water and sediment quality of Twin Lakes Reservoir is sufficiently improved that the reservoir supports a trout fishery, and remnants of upstream ARD are negligible.\n\nSediment data sources and estimated annual suspended-sediment loads of rivers and streams in Colorado\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nElliott, J.G.; DeFeyter, K.L.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nSources of sediment data collected by several government agencies through water year 1984 are summarized for Colorado. The U.S. Geological Survey has collected suspended-sediment data at 243 sites; these data are stored in the U.S. Geological Survey 's water data storage and retrieval system. The U.S. Forest Service has collected suspended-sediment and bedload data at an additional 225 sites, and most of these data are stored in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's water-quality-control information system. Additional unpublished sediment data are in the possession of the collecting entities. Annual suspended-sediment loads were computed for 133 U.S. Geological Survey sediment-data-collection sites using the daily mean water-discharge/sediment-transport-curve method. Sediment-transport curves were derived for each site by one of three techniques: (1) Least-squares linear regression of all pairs of suspended-sediment and corresponding water-discharge data, (2) least-squares linear regression of data sets subdivided on the basis of hydrograph season; and (3) graphical fit to a logarithm-logarithm plot of data. The curve-fitting technique used for each site depended on site-specific characteristics. Sediment-data sources and estimates of annual loads of suspended, bed, and total sediment from several other reports also are summarized.

The oval-shaped caldera is bounded by arcuate normal faults on the north and south and by rhyolite ring domes on the west. Precollapse ash-flow tuffs exposed within the south caldera rim consist of three cooling units and are peralkaline in composition. Refractive indexes of nonhydrated glasses from basal vitrophyres of the. units range from 1.493 to 1.503 and are typical of comendites. Post-collapse intracaldera rocks consist of tuffaceous lake sediments, rhyolite flows and domes, and ash-flow tuffs. Within the caldera are the mercury mines of Bretz, Cordero, McDermitt, Opalite, and Ruja and the Moonlight uranium mine. The mercury mines are adjacent to ring fracture faults, and the uranium mine and other uranium occurrences are located within rhyolite ring domes. Fluid inclusions in quartz indicate a deposition temperature of 340?C for the uranium deposit and 200?C for the mercury deposits. The mercury deposits formed at shallow depth by replacement of lakebed sediments and volcanic rocks.\n\nLithium enrichment in intracontinental rhyolite magmas leads to Li deposits in caldera basins.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenson, Thomas R; Coble, Matthew A; Rytuba, James J; Mahood, Gail A\n\n2017-08-16\n\nThe omnipresence of lithium-ion batteries in mobile electronics, and hybrid and electric vehicles necessitates discovery of new lithium resources to meet rising demand and to diversify the global lithium supply chain. Here we demonstrate that lake sediments preserved within intracontinental rhyolitic calderas formed on eruption and weathering of lithium-enriched magmas have the potential to host large lithium clay deposits. We compare lithium concentrations of magmas formed in a variety of tectonic settings using in situ trace-element measurements of quartz-hosted melt inclusions to demonstrate that moderate to extreme lithium enrichment occurs in magmas that incorporate felsic continental crust. Cenozoic calderas in western North America and in other intracontinental settings that generated such magmas are promising new targets for lithium exploration because lithium leached from the eruptive products by meteoric and hydrothermal fluids becomes concentrated in clays within caldera lake sediments to potentially economically extractable levels.Lithium is increasingly being utilized for modern technology in the form of lithium-ion batteries. Here, using in situ measurements of quartz-hosted melt inclusions, the authors demonstrate that preserved lake sediments within rhyolitic calderas have the potential to host large lithium-rich clay deposits.\n\nSummary of sediment data from the Yampa river and upper Green river basins, Colorado and Utah, 1993-2002\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nElliott, John G.; Anders, Steven P.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe water resources of the Upper Colorado River Basin have been extensively developed for water supply, irrigation, and power generation through water storage in upstream reservoirs during spring runoff and subsequent releases during the remainder of the year. The net effect of water-resource development has been to substantially modify the predevelopment annual hydrograph as well as the timing and amount of sediment delivery from the upper Green River and the Yampa River Basins tributaries to the main-stem reaches where endangered native fish populations have been observed. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Colorado Division of Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, began a study to identify sediment source reaches in the Green River main stem and the lower Yampa and Little Snake Rivers and to identify sediment-transport relations that would be useful in assessing the potential effects of hydrograph modification by reservoir operation on sedimentation at identified razorback spawning bars in the Green River. The need for additional data collection is evaluated at each sampling site. Sediment loads were calculated at five key areas within the watershed by using instantaneous measurements of streamflow, suspended-sediment concentration, and bedload. Sediment loads were computed at each site for two modes of transport (suspended load and bedload), as well as for the total-sediment load (suspended load plus bedload) where both modes were sampled. Sediment loads also were calculated for sediment particle-size range (silt-and-clay, and sand-and-gravel sizes) if laboratory size analysis had been performed on the sample, and by hydrograph season. Sediment-transport curves were developed for each type of sediment load by a least-squares regression of logarithmic-transformed data. Transport equations for suspended load and total load had coefficients of determination of at least 0.72 at all of the sampling sites except Little Snake River near\n\nPunctuated Sediment Discharge during Early Pliocene Birth of the Colorado River: Evidence from Regional Stratigraphy, Sedimentology, and Paleontology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDorsey, Rebecca J.; O'Connell, Brennan; McDougall, Kristin; Homan, Mindy B.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Colorado River in the southwestern U.S. provides an excellent natural laboratory for studying the origins of a continent-scale river system, because deposits that formed prior to and during river initiation are well exposed in the lower river valley and nearby basinal sink. This paper presents a synthesis of regional stratigraphy, sedimentology, and micropaleontology from the southern Bouse Formation and similar-age deposits in the western Salton Trough, which we use to interpret processes that controlled the birth and early evolution of the Colorado River. The southern Bouse Formation is divided into three laterally persistent members: basal carbonate, siliciclastic, and upper bioclastic members. Basal carbonate accumulated in a tide-dominated marine embayment during a rise of relative sea level between 6.3 and 5.4 Ma, prior to arrival of the Colorado River. The transition to green claystone records initial rapid influx of river water and its distal clay wash load into the subtidal marine embayment at 5.4-5.3 Ma. This was followed by rapid southward progradation of the Colorado River delta, establishment of the earliest through-flowing river, and deposition of river-derived turbidites in the western Salton Trough (Wind Caves paleocanyon) between 5.3 and 5.1 Ma. Early delta progradation was followed by regional shut-down of river sand output between 5.1 and 4.8 Ma that resulted in deposition of marine clay in the Salton Trough, retreat of the delta, and re-flooding of the lower river valley by shallow marine water that deposited the Bouse upper bioclastic member. Resumption of sediment discharge at 4.8 Ma drove massive progradation of fluvial-deltaic deposits back down the river valley into the northern Gulf and Salton Trough. These results provide evidence for a discontinuous, start-stop-start history of sand output during initiation of the Colorado River that is not predicted by existing models for this system.

Epithermal mineralization from fluid mixing in the OH vein\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHayba, D.O.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDetailed fluid inclusion studies on coarse-grained sphalerite from the OH vein, Creede, Colorado, have shown that the abrupt color changes between growth zones correspond to abrupt changes in the nature of the ore fluids. Within each growth zone, however, the composition of the fluids remained constant. The base of a distinctive orange-brown growth zone marks a sharp increase in both temperature and salinity relative to the preceding yellow-white zone. The orange-brown growth zone can be correlated along much of the vein and is believed to represent a time-stratigraphic interval. Along the vein, temperatures and salinities of fluid inclusions within this interval show a systematic decrease from about 285??C and 11.5 wt percent NaCl equiv near the base of the vein to about 250??C and 8 wt percent NaCl equiv, respectively, near the top of the vein. The iron concentration of this sphalerite growth zone shows a similar pattern, decreasing from about 2.8 to 1.2 mole percent FeS. When plotted on an enthalpy-salinity diagram, the fluid inclusion data define a spatial trend indicating the progressive mixing of deeply circulating hydrothermal brines with overlying, dilute ground waters. The hydrothermal brines entered the OH vein from below at a temperature, salinity, and density of approximately 28"
