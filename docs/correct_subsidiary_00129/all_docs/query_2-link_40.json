A REPRINT OF THE LAST (1880) EDINBURGH AND LONDON EDITION OF CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA, llitl; Copious ^ibifions in ^mtritan (Biters. FIFTEEN VOLUMES, VOLUME III. NEW YORK: AMERICAN BOOK EXCHANGE, TKIBUNE BUILDING, 1880. AMERICAN PUBLISHER'S NOTICE, THIS work, although based upon Chambers's Encyclopaedia, whose distinguished merit is widely known, differs from it in important respects. It could scarcely be expected that an Encyclopaedia, edited and published for a foreign market, would give as much prominence to American topics as American readers might desire. To supply these and other deficiencies the American Editors have inserted about 15,000 titles, arranging the whole, including Chambers's Supplement, in a single alphabet. The total number of titles is now about 40,000. The additions give greater fullness in the departments of biography, geography, history, natural history, and general and applied science. Scrupulous care has been taken not to mutilate or modify the original text of the edition of 1880 ; no changes have been made except such verbal alterations as are required by the omission of the wood-cuts. The titles of articles from Chambers's Encyclopaedia, either from the main work or from the Supplement, are printed in bold- faced type — AMERICA. The titles of the American additions, whether of new topics or of enlargements of the old, are printed in plain capitals— AMERICA. Should it appear that an article from the English work and its American continuation disagree in any points, the reader will readily refer the conflicting statements to their proper sources. The labor of consultation will be much reduced by the catch-words in bold-faced type at the top of the page, being the first and last titles of the pages which face each other; and by the full title-words on the back of the volume, being the first and last titles contained therein. The word ante refers to Chambers's Encyclopaedia, as represented in this issue. Whenever the word (ante) follows a title in the American additions, it indicates that the article is an enlargement of one under the same title in Chambers's Encyclopaedia — usually to be found immediately preceding.

C35- LIBRARY OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE. BRAZEN SEA, the large metal vessel, probably of copper, oval shaped, with 12 oxen for a pedestal — the beasts standing in a circle with their heads outward, and the vessel resting on their rumps. It was in the priest's court of Solomon's temple, and. held water for the use of the servitors. BRAZIL , the most extensive state of South America. Towards the interior, it borders on all the other states of South America except Chili and Buenos Ayres — on Uruguay, the Argentine Confederation, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, the United States of Colombia. Venezuela, and Guiana, English, Dutch, and French; while its sea-board, beginning about 200 m. to the n. of the Amazon, and reaching to within the same distance of the Plata, projects into the Atlantic fully 1000 m. to the e. of the direct line — pretty nearly a meridian — between its two extremes. This immense coun try extends between lat. 4° 30' n. and 33° s., and between long. 35° and 703 w., being, in round numbers, 2600 m. lon» and 2500 broad. The area, according to official ac- counts, is 3,200,000 sq. miles. But B. was not always, in point of extent, what it now is. The Portuguese, Avho, in 1500, accidentally discovered the s.e. coast of the country (but that only after one of the Pinzons had, on behalf of Spain, followed the shores of the continent from its eastern angle to the mouth of the Orinoco), claimed all between the Plata and the Amazon, Soon, however, the Spaniards of Buenos Ayres, feeling that the complete command of their mighty river was to them a necessary of life, colon ized the left bank by founding Montevideo. But nearly twenty years earlier, B. had acquired more territory on the Amazon than it was to abandon on the Plata, having, in 1509, wrested from France, then at war with Portugal, what may now be designated Brazilian Guiana. It was only in 1531 that the Portuguese, busy as they were in India, here planted their first settlement. In 1578, B. fell, along with Portugal itself, under the power of Spam — a connection which, besides being essentially detrimental, speedily threw it as a prey into the hands of the Dutch republic; and though Portugal regained its own independence in 1640, it was not until 1654 that B. was entirely recov- ered from the Hollanders. Thenceforward, the colony entered on a new era. Sup- planted, in a great measure, throughout the east by the Dutch, the mother-country was now directing most of its attention to its possessions on either side of the Atlantic. About a century and a half later, a still more beneficial change — and that, too, arising from the mother- country's own disasters — was inaugurated in the colony. In 1808, under the pressure of French invasion, the monarchy, in the persons of the royal family, wa< virtually transferred from Portugal to B., an event which, doubtless through British counsels and influence, was immediately followed by the opening of the ports to foreigners. As a remoter benefit, too, of an incident which had no paralled either in English or in Spanish America, B. . on shaking off. like its neighbors, the European yoke altogether, found a merely nominal revolution sufficient for its purpose, establish- ing, or rather accepting, an hereditary empire instead of restless and precarious repub- licanism; and ever since the transition-period of 1821-25, this consolidated government, with subordinate institutions for local objects, has secured toB.'s twenty vast provinces comparative unity and peace. A war was undertaken in 1865, in concert with the Argentine republic and Uruguay (formerly a province of B.), against Paraguay, which terminated in the defeat of the Paraguayans; and in 1872 Paraguay ceded to B., as a war-indemnity, the long-disputed territory comprised between the Paraguay and the Parana, n. of the Apa and Igatim. This \"territory has an extent of about 16,000 sq. miles. The executive authority is vested in the emperor, who, besides being aided by a council of state, must act through responsible ministers. The legislature consists of two chambers, which sit four months every year. Both the deputies and the senators, who must have annual incomes respectively of 800 millreas and 1600 are indirectly elected by voters, who must possess 200 millreas per annum — the former for four years, •and the latter for life. The senate, however, appears to represent the crown as well as the people, inasmuch as each constituency merely nominates three individuals for his majesty's choice of one. Justices of peace, also, are appointed by the respective com- 301 149 Brazil. munities; and in the courts generally, whether civil or criminal, there prevails trial by- jury. The .budget of 1878-79 gave a' revenue of 103,300,000 paper millreas. ami expendi- ture, lu?.?: paper millrea is about half the value of the silver eoin, which is about 2*.}-. the public debt in is:: was 701,952,781 iniUreaa— nearly £35,000,000. The standing army is fixed at 13, 000 men on the peace-footing, and at 32,000 on the war- footing; and the standing naval force is fixed at 4000 men, which may be raised to 8000 in time of war. The navy in 1877 consisted of 56 vessels, including 53 steamers and 11 ironclads. The population in 1872 amounted to 10,108,291 negroes, mulattoes, and Europeans, besides about 1.000,000 aboriginal Indians, who are hen proportionally fewer than in most parts of South America. Of the total pop. 1,510,806 were slaves\". The Africans continued to be imported till 1854, and their amalgamation with the Europeans pro- duced perhaps the finest variety of the mulatto in the world. A law for the gradual emancipation of the slaves was passed in 1871. It enacts that henceforth the children born of slave women shall be \"considered of free condition,\" but bound to serve the owners of their mothers for the term of 21 years, under the name of apprentices. Roman Catholicism is the prevailing religion. Notwithstanding the recent efforts of the legislature for the advancement of education, it is still very defective. In 1874, the attendance at the public schools was only 140,000. But physically, as well as politically and socially, B. differs in many respects from most of the other divisions of the new continent. It knows nothing of the volcanoes and earthquakes of the Pacitic coast; with winds blowing constantly from the Atlantic ocean, it is exempted from those droughts which are always blighting one or other of the slopes of the Andes, the remoter slope in Peru and Chili, and the nearer in Buenos Ayres and Patagonia; its mines, again, are as famous for gold and diamonds as those of the western Cordilleras for silver. In its hydrography, B. contrasts unfavorably with the other divisions. While the Amazon and the Plata, the .Mississippi and the St. Lawrence — not to mention countless rivers of inferior magnitude on both shores — are for the most part practicable almost to their sources, the streams of B., with the exception of the Amazon, are mostly impeded throughout by cataracts and shallows, thus counterbalanc- ing, as it were, its matchless seaward facilities by the deficiencies of its inland communi- cations. Further, the most navigable of these streams, instead of entering the open >ea, mingle their waters with those of the Plata or of the Amazon — the Parana and the Uruguay joining the former, and the Madera, the Tapajos, the Zingu, and the Tocan- tins, the latter; and even among those that do send their tribute at once to the ocean, a similar direction is sometimes impressed by the dividing ridges — the San Francisco, for instance, by far the largest of them, running to the northward parallel with li coast through 11D of lat., and leaving only 4° of long, for its remaining course to the Atlantic. A humid surface and a luxuriant vegetation conspire to render ordinary roads all but impassible. B. possessed, at the commencement of 1878. railways of a total length of 791 m., and it has also a system of telegraphs, the lines at the same date being 3875 m. in extent. Telegraphic communication has been established between B. and Europe; the first message was despatched by the cable to Lisbon, June 23, 1874. Among the mineral treasures, besides gold and diamonds already mentioned, iron of superior quality is abundant; and salt, also, is extensively produced in saline marshes by the alternate processes, according to the season, of inundation and evaporation. The productions of the soil, which are, of course, equally various and rich, will be more satisfactorily considered under the heads of the respective localities. Suffice it to say, that the cotton is naturally excellent, and that the tea-plant of China has been intro- duced, though hitherto with indifferent success. The exports are necessarily different from the different sections of the country. From the n., they are coffee, cotton, cocoa. sugar, and tobacco; from the s., hides, tallow, horns, etc. ; and from the middle, drugs, diamonds, gold-dust, dyes, rice, manioc, tapioca, spirits, and rosewood. Their total value in five years, 1873-77, averaged £17,500,000; the corresponding imports averaging £17,000,000. The chief centers of foreign trade, and, along with San Paulo in the inte- rior, the principal cities of the empire, are Para, MaranhSo, Bahia, Pernambuco, and Rio de Janeiro. This last-named port, which is likewise the seat of government, is the favorite halting-place of the outward-bound vessels for India, China, and Australia. BRAZIL (ante) comprises 3,288,000 sq.m. ; and the several islands adjoining in the Atlantic, the most important of which is Fernando Noronha, 250 m. e. from cape St. Roque, and the penal settlement of the empire. The boundaries of B. are sufficiently described, ante. The most striking physical feature of the country is the Amazon river, which with its numerous tributaries affords 30,000 m. of navigation within the territory of the empire. (See AMAZON.) Next in importance is the Tocantins river, which rises in the s. central part of the country, and flows directly n. for 900 m., uniting with the Para branch of the Amazon. The river Araguaya, parallel with and w. of the Tocan- tins, divides about midway in its course, and afterwards unites, Indoeing between its two channels the remarkable Banana] island. 220 m. in circumference, and containing a lake 80 m. in extent. The Turyassu, Maranhao, and Paranahyba are the largest of the other rivers of the n.e. slope. The San Francisco occupies a wide inclosed basin of the eastern highland, and has a course n. and e. of 1800 m., navigable 160 m. from the ocean. Brazil. Further s. on the coast slope are the Paraguasu, the Rio de Contas, the Belmenti. the Rio Doce, arid the Paranahyba do Sul, all of them to some extent navigable. The great rivers of the southern watershed are the Parana and the Paraguay (.q.v.). The Parana rises in a broad basin which extends for 700 m. in width across .s. Brazil. The Paraguay has its source in several small lakes between li> and 14° s., taking in as it flows south- ward a number of large and small streams, and affording uninterrupted navigation through nearly its whole course, large steamers running up about 1000 m. in a direct line from Buenos Ayres, and smaller craft going 300 m. further. The other large rivers, such as the Xingu. Tapajos. Madeira, Purus, Jurua, Javari, Zapura, Negro, Jamuda, etc., are tributaries of the Amazon. In respect to elevation, the surface of the country is divided into the higher regions of plateaus, ridges, and broad open valleys, occupying the whole of the country s. of the latitude of cape St. liuquc. and the vast lowland plain of the Amazon, extending across the continent to the base of the Andes of Peru. Ecuador, and Colombia, rising\" in the extreme u. to the range- which form the boundary of Venezuela and Guiana. The highest and most important mountains in B. are the Serra da Mantiqueira and the Serra do Espinhago, between 18 and ',»:! s., and i'mm 1(K) to 200 m. from the sea-coast. The highest peak has been estimated from 8900 to 10,300 feet. There is a coast range of moun- tains beginning n. of Rio Janerio, and running both n. and s. not far from^the ocean; but none of the peaks exceed 7500 feet. The remarkably even character of the great level of the river provinces may be known from the fact that, where the Amazon enters B. at Tabatiuga, more than 1500 in. in a direct line from the ocean, the river banks are not more than 250 ft. above sea-level. The rock formation of the mountains is chiefly gneiss. C'lay-slates are found between the Parana and the Paraguay, and true carbonifer- ous strata occur m the coal basins s. of the tropic. Carboniferous rocks occur, but Jura-sir rocks do not appear. Coral reefs occur along the n. coast. The limestones of the upper San Francisco basin contain the celebrated bone caverns which have been described by Lund, the Danish naturalist. In some of these the remains of extinct animals of high antiquity have been found, such as those of the mastodon, mylodon, giyptodou. toxo- dou, and megatherium; and with these, stone implements and remains of man so buried with the bones of the extinct fauna as to lead to the conclusion that man was contempo- raneous with them. There are no signs of recent volcanic action in B., but warm springs are found in several places, saline and alkaline, varying from 88° to 119°, the warmest at an elevation of 6000ft. above the sea. In minerals and jewels B. is very rich. Diamonds were found, in 1786, 300 m. n. of Rio, and at later periods in many other sections. The emerald, ruby, sapphire, topaz, beryl, tourmaline (black, blue, and green), amethyst, garnet, rock crystal, chalcedony, opal, agate, and camel nm are more or less plentiful. There are several large coal basins, and also sulphur, saltpeter, and salt. Gold is abundant in many of the provinces, always accompanied by silver. Silver alone was found in large quantities more than 200 years ago. There are rich mines of mercury not far from the capital; and copper, lead. iron, and manganese are also abundant. The climate of this immense country is naturally widely varied. In the northern lowlands, between the tropics, it is very hot, with but two seasons in the year — the dry and the wet. In the higher lands it is milder, and in the extreme s. the four seasons are tolerably well marked. The wet season lasts from Dec. or Jan. until May or June, with ;onal intervals of fine weather. The other half of the year is dry, but not without occasional shower-. The amount of water in the wet season is enormous, often pro- ducing a rise of 40 ft. in the great rivers, and heavy rains are accompanied with abund- ant lightning and thunder. At Maranhao the annual rain-fall has been as high as 280 in., while at Rio Janeiro it is but 59 or -60 inches. Temperature is remarkably even, particularly in the Amazon basin. A record kept at Para between 1861 and 1867 showed the annual mean of 80° with extremes of 68C and 95°. The greatest ranges are in the central and southern tablelands and mountain ridges, where the coast temperature is hot and the air humid, while in the interior there may be snow and a little ice. The pre- vailing winds are the trades from the e., sweeping in the moisture of the Atlantic, and reaching inland along the whole valley of the Amazon to the Andes. These winds greatly mitigate the heat of the dry season. In the interior the course of winds is n. or s., blow- Dually toward the sun. Along the ocean the usual interchanging land and sea breezes are of regular daily occurrence. Malarial fevers prevail in some of the low and marshy districts, but. as a whole. B is a healthy country. There have been epidemics of cholera and j-ellow-f ever ; but the ordinary mortality of cities and towns compares favorably with that of European r;;' Vegetation in B. is wonderfully prolific. Except on the loftiest mountains and in some stony districts, the country \"is hixuriant with vegetable life. In the mountain . near the sea-shore, the joint effect of heat and moisture produces a growth beyond man's efforts to restrain. Trees cut and split for. fences send forth shoots and branches immediately, and this whether the position of the fragments be that in which they originally grew, or inverted. Along the Amazon the loftiest trees destroy each other in consequence of near proximity, \"in the province of Maranhao roots ofir and other plants extending from the shores of pools weave themselves into vegetable bridges, along which the wanderer treads, unaware that he has left solid land until he Brazil. 6 sees the jaws of a cayman protruding through the herbage beneath him. Along the coast mangroves are numerous and prominent, and so rank is their growth that the seeds begin to sprout before they drop from the parent stem, while the drooping branches strike iuto the soil and take root. Ik-hind the mangroves come the palms in great variety, while the underwood is chiefly crotons. Brushwood and herbage are aeldom seen; everything tends to the gigantic in >i/.e. The n.ost varied forms group awkwardly together, crossed and intertwined with leaves. The preponderance of trees with feathery foliage, and g!os>y, llohy leaves, lends alternately a tender and luxuriant character to the scene, which in every other re.-pect is painful from its monotony. Cocoa trees, the vanilla, the cinnamon tree, various kinds of pepper, and Brazilian cassia are found. Above the falls of tin- large rivers the vegetation is generally different ; and so is that of the southern pampas or prairies. Tin-re are found beautiful flowers, and at intervals groves of small trees growing far apart, while solitary myrtles, fruit trees, and occasionally a cactus add variety to the prospect. The cactus is prolific on the hot steeps of Pernambuco, and the medicinal ipecacuanha flourishes in Terro do 3Iar. In the valley of the Paraguay there is a profusion of water plants, in one river so many and so strong as seriously to obstruct navigation. The cocoa tree is in abundance near the sea-shore; Brazil-wood, noted for its dyes and its value as limber. U!M> grows near the sea. Besides these there are the rosewood tree, the trumpet tree, the soap tree, the laurel-pear tree, and abundance of palms. The carnauba palm is one of the most useful trees; every part is valuable, even the wax yielded by its leaves being an article of commerce. More important still is the caoutchouc, or India rubber tree-, the gum of which exported from B. annually amounts to more than $5,000,000. The banana tree furnishes the food of a great portion of the population. Other important fruits are the mango, pine-apple, custard-apple, guava, melons, and nuts. Although not more than one acre in 200 in all B. is under cultivation, it ranks high as an agricultural country for some articles. The chief productions are coffee, sugar. cotton, manico or cassava flour, tobacco, rice, maize, fruits, and spices. Wheat and flour are imported from the United States. The varieties of animal life in B. are probably more numerous than in any other part of the globe. Of beasts of prey the jaguar, or fc>outh American tiger, is the most formid- able; besides this animal there are the tiger cat. the puma, the ocelot, the red wolf, and the Brazil fox or wild dog. Large herds of peccary roam in the forests, where also are tapirs, largest of South American animals. The water hog, abundant on the river banks, is the largest rodent. Various species of deer inhabit the plains. Of edentata there are several species of armadillos, the ant-eater, and the sloth; and of marsupialia there are many kinds of the opossum family all over the country. Of monkeys the variety is surprising; the largest belong to the genus stentor, and are known as howling monkeys. The simia jacchus is found in no other region. There are many species of bats; while of birds the variety is wonderful, from the ouira. an eagle faV larger and more powerful than the most important of European birds of prey, to humming-birds not larger than humble-bees. Among larger birds is the rhea. a species of ostrich. Most birds of B. are noted for beauty of plumage, lied, blue, and green parrots haunt the tree-tops; pigeons in great varieties throng the woods; orioles resort to the orange groves; chattering manakius mislead the sportsman; and the metallic tones of the uraponga resound through the forests like the strokes of a hammer on an anvil. The toucan is prized for its feathers, which are of lemon and bright red color, with transverse stripes reaching to the extremities of the wings. One beauti- ful specimen of the humming-bird has the native name of the \"enanthe engera,\" or \" winged flower.\" Serpents are found in great varieties, the most venomous being the rattlesnake and the jararaca. Others, such as the boa, attain enormous size. There are also many varieties of annoying insects along the rivers; one of them, the puim, so small as to be nearly invisible, inflicting a painful and sometimes dangerous bite. The red ant is a destroyer of vegetation, and large districts are sometimes laid waste by its ravages. Spiders attain enormous size, but few of them are venomous. Butter- flies are innumerable, and of the most surprising beauty. .V do/en varieties of wild bees, most of them honey-makers, have been noted. Caymans and lizards abound. The supply of turtle in the Amazon and its tributaries appears inexhaustible. The sea and the streams abound in fish, among which naturalists have within the p.-e-t few years found many hundreds of kinds before unknown. One of the largest, the pira rucu, is the principal food of large numbers of people along the Para and the Amazon. The more important domestic animals are the Imr-e. ox, and sheep. Immense numbers of wild horses roam the great southern prairies, found srenerallv in droves of 20 or 30. Cattle also roam wild, and are killed in great numbers for 'their hides, horns, and tallow, which form a large proportion of the exports of the country. The population of B. presents a number of distinct t\\ pes, as well as many var'i blended therefrom. In the rtistern or maritime provinces the aboriginal Indians have. toa great extent, become amalgamated with the settled population; but in the great forests and plains of the interior, they are nearly all in a savage condition. In 1 description the Indians are copper-colored, of medium height, thick set. broad- chested, and muscular, with small hands and feet, and well-shaped limbs; hair black. thick, and straight; features broad, cheek-bones not generally prominent; eyes black, Brazil. and sometimes oblique like those of the Chinese; in disposition apathetic and unde- monstrative. Though considerably differing in different sections they appear to belong to one original stock, called the Tupi-Guavani. The only tribe that has almost entirely resisted the inroads of civilization is that of the Botocudos (q. v.), living in the forests of the Rio Doce, who are sunk in the lowest barbarism, and art- fast dying out. From the mixture of the natives with Europeans, mainly with the Portuguese, are descended the Mamlucos, who lirst became prominent in raids and con- quests in the southern provinces. Xegroes, originally from Africa, form a large propor- tion of the population; and from these and whites have sprung mulattoes of all shades. The B. Creoles, who call themselves Brazilerios, descendants of these mixed races, are little inferior in capacity, physical strength, or intelligence to the true Portuguese. A great social reform was begun by the law enacted in Sept., 1871, providing that after the date of the act all children born of slave parents should be free, and that all slaves belonging to the state or the emperor's household should likewise be free; and the same law set apart an emancipation fund to be applied to the ransom of slaves owned by private persons. Since that time emancipation has gone on rapidly, the work having been greatly assisted by private philanthropy, and by many of the slaveholders them- selves. The importation of slaves was forbidden in 1853, and since then more than a million persons have obtained their freedom. The rapid progress of emancipation after 1871 caused some difficulty in the supply of labor; but the ultimate effect has been to give new avenues for the employment of capital, promote internal improvements, and induce desirable emigration from Europe. Enterprises of all kinds have multiplied, and public instruction has received a vigorous impulse. Until after 1872, when a full census was begun, even' estimate of the population of B. had been based upon the official re- turns of 1817 and 18. In the first census the total was put at 4,396,000; in 1850, a round number, 7,000,000; and in 1860, 8,000,000. In the following table for 1872 the figures for the provinces marked * are estimated on the best available knowledge; those not marked are the census figures: POPULATION. PROVINCES. Sq. Miles. Free.

Senators are chosen for life at electoral meetings specially convened, each of which nominates three candidates, leaving the choice of them to the sovereign or his ministers. A senator must be of native birth, 40 years old, and must have an annual income of $800; there are 58 of them, and their salaries are $1800 per annum. Members of the house, or congress, are elected for four years. The empire is divided into elec- toral districts, in which every 30 voters select one elector, and the electors, varying in number according to population, nominate a deputy from each district. The house is (•(imposed of 122 members. A voter must have an income of (about) $112; an elector of $225, and a deputy of $450 per year. All registered voters must vote, or suffer a pen- alty. Minors, monks, and servants may not vote; and naturalized foreigners, and persons not of the state religion (Roman Catholic), are ineligible as deputies. The deputies have a salary of $1200 per annum, besides traveling expenses. Sessions are limited to four months. Each house chooses its own officers, and at the opening and closing of a session both houses sit in a general assembly for the disposal of important business. For ordinary purposes, they sit separately. Taxation, provision for the army and navy, and, if it should become necessary, the choice of a sovereign, originate in the house of * There are prooably 1,000,000 Indians not taken Into account. r.r.i/ii. o Uiaiiug. deputies. Tin- .-cnatc deals with offenses committed by members of the imperial family and by senators and deputies it' committed during the session, aud is invested with the right of convoking the legislative assembly should the emperor fail to do so for two months alter the period tix'ed by law. The executive power is hi the sovereign, assisted by the ministers and a council of >tate. The ministers are responsible for treason. corruption, abuse of power, and all acts contrary to the constitution, or the liberty, .-ecuriiy, and property of citi/.ens; a responsibility from which they cannot escape on .•nlers from the sovereign. The executive functions consist in the couvoca :; nary meetings of the legislative assembly; the nomination of bi-hops, :iors (if provinces, and magistrates, the declaration of peace or war, and the gene .• cution and superintendence of all measures voted by the legislature. The moder -ted in the sovereign, gives him authority not only to select ministers •s. but to temporarily withhold his sanction from legislative measures, to \\iraordiuary .-r-.-ion- of the legislative a>semblics, to dis.-olve the chamber of deputies, and to grant amnesty and pardon. There are 7 ministries — war, foreign, interior, marine, \"finance, justice and public works, agriculture and commerce. The mini- -isted by a council of state consisting of 12 ordinary and 12 extraordinary members, all named by the emperor, and holding office continuously. They are usually t •x-ministers. The heir to the throne, if of age, is by right a councilor of state. At the head of each province is a president appointed \"by the general government : and each province has its local legislature, or provincial chamber, called the legislative assembly of the province. The members of the latter are nominated by the electors who choose deputies to the national assembly, but the members of the provincial chambers are chosen directly by the electors for two years. The power of these provin- cial bodies over local affairs is analogous to that of the general assembly over affairs of the empire. The Roman Catholic is the established religion, but all others are tolerated \" with the domestic or private forms of worship in buildings destined for the purpose, but without the exterior forms of temples.\" No one can be persecuted for religious acts or motives. The Roman Catholic clergy are maintained by the state; but funds are also voted for the assistance of other sects. No ecclesiastical decree can have force without )K.-rmission of the emperor or of the general assembly. Marriages of Protestants cele- brated in foreign countries are respected. The empire constitutes an ecclesiastical province of the Roman see, with an archbishop, 11 bishops, 12 vicars general, and about 1300 curates. Public education is in three distinct divisions — primary, secondary, and scientific. The first is gratuitous, and \"will become compulsory as soon as the govern inent considers it opportune.\" Thus far it is very backward. The trade and commerce of B. have rapidly increased within the past decade. In 1877, there were 1438 m. of railroad open for traffic, and 800 m. in course of construe lion. Telegraphs, though comparatively new, reported 3890 miles. There were at the close of 1876; 1018 post-offices, and 13,165,000 letters for the year. Weights and measure.- are those of the French metric system. The standard of value is the gold octava of 22 carats, equal to 4 milreis, or 4000 reis; value at the U. S. mint, $2.18. BRAZIL, a city in Clay co., Ind., on the St. Louis, Vandalia, Terre Haute, and Indianapolis railroad, 57 m. w.s.w. of Indianapolis; pop 70, 2186; in 'bO, 3530. Then- are coal and iron mines near the place, and the people are largely engaged in mining and manufacturing. There are six churches, two banks, four weekly newspapers, and a ii umber of good schools. BRAZIL', ISLAND OF, one of the mythical islands of the Atlantic set down by early oosmographen. The Arabic geography of Edrisi (middle of the 12th c.) describes severe] nucli islands, and in Mercator's atlas. 400 years later, the northern Atlantic (now known to be nearly clear of islands) is as full of islands as the sky is of stars. Among these mythical places were the isle of St. Brandon, said to have been discovered by the Irish in the 6th c., of which many wonders were told; the island of Anlilia; the island of the t 'itics, said to have been the place of refuge of Christians flying from the Saracen conquerors of Spain; the island of Mayda, or Asmaide; and me isle Verde, behind Which the inhabitants Of the Hebrides imagine they see the sun disappear at setting, however, were more famous than the isle of'Brazil, the name of which connects it with the red dye-wood of the same appellation.

BRAZIL NUTS are the seeds of the bertholletia excflsa, a majestic and beautiful tree of the natural order lecj/thUlnai.p (q.v.). The tree grows to the height of 100 or 120 ft., and abounds on the banks of the Orinoco and in the northern parts of Brazil. It pro- duces a round woody pericarp or seed-vessel, almost as large as a man's head, within which are many of the seeds or nuts. The pericarp is very heavy and solid, requiring a blow of a sledge-hammer to break it; and at the time when this great fruit is ready to fall, it is dangerous to walk under the tree. The seeds, which are popularly called nuts. and much resemble fruits of that description, are wrinkled and triangular, having a hard shell and a pure white kernel, which, when fresh, is very agreeable. They are chiefly exported from Para and French Guiana, and are well known in our shops. They yield a large quantity of oil, which is good for burning. The nuts or seeds of thelecytTtis oUant, or POT TREE, are produced in a pericarp which resembles a rusty iron pot with a lid, the lid dropping off and letting the seeds out, which are oblong, grooved, and esteemed of a very superior quality to the common B.. N. ; but they have not yet become an article of commerce, as the tree grows chiefly in the interior parts of the country, from which the nuts are only occasionally sent to the coast. BRAZIL WOOD, a dark-red or yellowish-brown dye-wood, which forms a consider- able article of export from Brazil, where some of the trees which yield it are very abun- dant. It is the produce of different species of c<.txtilpi/titi (q.v.). The best kinds are those called Pernambuco wood, all saints' wood, and St. Martha wood. Much of the B. W. of commerce is obtained from cceml/ »'///\" Hrn.-<iU> nsis, a tree which is a native of the West Indies, commonly growing in dry places and among rocks, and seldom exceeding 30 ft. in height. It has bipiuuate leaves, with many smooth, obtuse, oblong leaflets, and no terminal leaflets, the flowers in pannicles, with downy stalks. The heart-wood alone is of any value. — PEHXAMBCCO WOOD is the produce of ccesalpinia echinata, a prickly tree, with prickly pods, and of which the red and yellow flowers have a deli- cious smell, resembling that of the lily of the valley. The sap-wood is extremely thick, and the valuable heart-wood bears a small proportion to the whole diameter of the stem. — The sappan wood (q.v.) of the East Indies nearly approaches B.W. in quality. It is the produce of a small thorny tree. — The BRAZILETTO WOOD, sometimes also called B. W., which is brought from the Antilles, is much inferior. Ccesalpinia crista probably j'ields some of the inferior West Indian Brazil wood. — It is a curious circum- stance, that B. W. is said not to take its name from Brazil, but to be mentioned under the name Braj-iUs in documents much older than the discovery of America, the sappan wood of the East Indies being probably intended, and the name of Brazil has even been supposed to be derived from that of this product of its soil. When freshly cut, the color of B. W. is yellow; but when exposed to air, moisture, and light, it becomes red, and is generally sent into market ground down to the size of ordinary sawdust. \\Vhen treated with 'water, alcohol, or ether, the weathered B. W. readily yields up its red coloring matter, called Brazelein. The latter is supposed to be produced from the oxidation of a colorless substance called Brazilin, which exists in the original yellow wood of the tree. Strong decoctions of B. W. are used by the dyer and calico-printer in the fabrication of reds, browns, etc. ; it is also used in the manufac- ture of red ink. See INK. BRAZING, or BRASS SOLDERING, is the process of uniting together two pieces of brass, two pieces of copper, or one of each, by means of a hard solder, partaking more or less of the composition and properties of ordinary brass. The edges or parts of metal to be joined are first filed bright, so as to be thoroughly clean, then there is strewed over the gap or crevice a mixture of the solder and borax. The solder employed varies in com- position according to the kind of work, and may be rendered more fusible by the addition of a larger amount of zinc, but the general proportions are (1) 16 copper, 16 zinc, and 1 tin; (2) 12 brass, 4 zinc, and 3 tin; or (3) 18 brass, 3 zinc, and 2 tin. When the whole has been fused together, it is allowed to cool, and is then filed down to a coarse powder, in which stale it is used. The borax is employed to form a glaze over the brightened sur- faces, and thus prevent the oxidation of the metal, which would seriously interfere with B., and even stop the operation. An outward coating or layer of charcoal is likewise serviceable in the exclusion of the air during the B. of large pieces of metal. Where a very high heat is required in the process, a little powdered glass is mixed with the borax. The mixture of solder and borax may be applied dry, but it is better to moisten it with water, and to lay it on the tiled surfaces with a spoon. The whole is then gently heated, when the water evaporates and leaves a crust of borax and solder. The work may now be strongly heated before the blow-pipe, or over a clear fire, and at a bright red heat the solder fuses, and the zinc begins to burn with a pale-blue flame. At this stag*, the solder jfctt&ea or !H> omes liquid enough to permeate the joint or crevice; but should it be tardy in acting thus, several slight taps will insure the proper result. The whole is now cooled, and. towards the close, the articles may be introduced into cold water for more rapid reduction in temperature.

With a coiir-e of about 900 in., it is navigable at all times to a distance of 40 in. from its mouth, and at certain seasons to a distance of 300 miles. The valley of the river, the lower half being merely an alluvial plain, presents extensive forests, interspersed with plantations of mai/.e, sugar, and cotton.

Its surface is mountainous, and extensively wooded; vines, yielding excellent wine, are grown in the valleys, and figs, saffron, almonds, and oil are produced in considerable quantities, but not much grain is rai-ed. IJces and silk-worms are reared in large1 num- bers. B. is also celebrated for its cheese, and the delicacy of the flesh of its lambs and kids. Excellent building-stone, which is largely exported, is found in the e. part of the island. St. Pictro di Brazza is the chief town. BREACH, in siege-works, is a gap in any of the defensive walls or gates of a city; and brtttc/iiiiff is the operation by which the gap is produced by the guns of the !• c r>. ISriitchiiiy butt, rux are employed, consisting of several pieces of ordnaix chosen as to kind and size, and so placed as to distance, as to burst a hole through the defenses in the shortest practicable time. The greatest effect is produced by lodging the balls in two vertical lines, from the parapet of the wall downwards, and in a hori- zontal line, connecting the lower ends of those vertical lines; and then overturning the :na-< of material thus loosened by an irresistible salvo or volley. When a hole ha- been made, by thus knocking away the masonry or earthwork, the breaching i> ton- tinned until the crumbling mass has so accumulated as to form a practicable slope, up which the storming-party of the besiegers may run. See ASSAULT. During the Pen in sular war there were some formidable examples of breaching. At Badajoz, 14,000 shot brought down 180 ft. of wall in 104 hours, from a distance of 450 yards. At (\"mdad IJodrigo, 6700 balls brought down 105 ft. of wall in 32 hours, from a distance of oHO yards. At St. Sebastian, 13,000 shot brought down 100 ft. of wall in 62 day-, t distance of 620 yards. It was calculated, from these and other instances, that 10,000 24-lb. shot, or 240,000 Ibs. of iron, will breach 100 ft. of wall from a distance of 500 yards — the wall being of fair average masonry, and the height and thickness a fair aver.-' those used in fortified towns. It must be remembered, however, that this estima; made before the days of rifled cannon and Armstrong guns; and, on the other hand, that the walls adverted to were not constructed of granite. BREACH, in law, signifies a breaking or violation of a right or of an obligation or engagement legally binding; and in this sense it has numerous applications, of which the following are those more particularly treated in law-book-: BRKACII OF AKKKSTMKNT, in the practice of the Scotch law, is the disregard or violation of the process of arrestment, or attachment, by the arrestee, or party in pos- session of the arrested or attached property, but who, notwithstanding, pays the sums or delivers the goods arrested; and such B. is viewed by the courts as a contempt. 1'ut at pre.-ent the only consequence of the B. is, that the person guilty of it, where it is a to inoHuj. is liable in damages to the extent of the funds paid away, and the Where goods are arrested, and the ITH -m1(.nt is removed on bail (or \"'loosed on caution,\" as the Scotch lawyers say), if the goods themselves cannot be ivovcred, or their value cannot be clearly ascertained, th\" surety or \"cautioner\" is held to be liable for the original debt. See A IIKI-I MKNT. Tn England, the disputing or disobeying a rule«or order by a judge for attachment of a debt very nearly means the same thing. :!Mi.\\ r, GAUM- M by which an I-P warrantable entry is made on another man's land, for satisfaction of which injury an action will lie to recover damage.-.

Breach. material fence, as one field is divided from another by a hedge; or by an invisible boundary, existing only in the contemplation of the law, as when one man's land adjoins to another's in the same tield. The liability to this injury attaches not only to the party himself trespassing, but also to trespass by his cattle. And the law gives the party injured a double remedy in this case, by permitting him to distrain the cattle till the owner shall make satisfaction, or else by leaving him to the ordinary remedy by action for the damage done. But in some cases this trespass is justifiable; as where it is done in exercise of a right of way, right of common, or the like; or where a man comes to demand or pay money payable on the particular land; or to execute, in a legal manner, the process of the law; or by the license of the plaintiff himself. Also, a man may justify entering into an inn or public-house without the leave of the owner first specially asked; because when a man professes the keeping of such an inn or public-house, he thereby gives a general license to any person to enter his doors. So a landlord may justify entering to distrain for rent; and a reversioner to see if any waste be committed on the estate, for the apparent necessity of the thing; and it has been held that the common law warrants the hunting of ravenous beasts of prey, as badgers and foxes, in another man's land, if no greater damage be done than is necessary, because the de- stroying such creatures is said to be profitable to the public. But in cases where a man misdemeans himself, or makes an ill use of the authority with which the law intrusts him, he is accounted a trespasser a// initi<>; as if one comes into a tavern, and will not go out in a reasonable time, but remains there all ni«Tit, contrary to the inclinations of the owner; such wrongful act is held to affect and have relation back even to his first entry, and make the whole a trespass. But a bare iionfeasauce, as not paying for the wine he calls for, will not make him a trespasser, for this is only a B. of contract. See Blackstone and Stephen's Com. respecting \"civil injuries.\" In the Scotch law, the term close is not used, and not known — but there any vio- lation of a right of property in land may be redressed by legal process, and in many cases form the ground of an action for the recovery of damages. See CLOSE. The term ///<•/»*///•« , in Scotch law. has a different meaning, although the penalties for break- ing such inclosure are somewhat, analogous to those for breach of close. See below, BUEAKING INCI.OSUUE. and see 'I'm. SI-ASS. BREACH OK COVKNANT is one of those civil injuries by which is meant a violation of a covenant or agreement contained in a deed of conveyance, either to do or omit to do something, and which B. gives a right of action against the party who made the cove- nant and his representatives. See COVENANT. BKKACII OF CONTRACT i< a general description of injury, by which is understood the violation of any contract or legal engagement, and for which, at law, damages may be recovcivil. according to the nature of the breach and character of the contract. In 1854, jurisdiction was conferred upon the courts of common law, by which a plaintiff can compel a defendant to fulfill any actual duty. But till the constitution of the new high court of justice in 1S73, it was only in the courts of equity that complete relief was given by enforcing the specific performance of contracts. See CONTRACT; DAM- AGES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; EQUITY, COURTS OF; CIIAN< KHV, COURT OF. In Scotland, although there is no distinction between law and equity, the remedy for this injury is very much the same. The party wronged may either conclude for damages, or adfactum i>r<xtni~«lniit, or for both these remedies. BREUU OF DUTY may be legally defined as either the non-execution of an office, or the performance of it in such a way that the conditions on which it is undertaken are violated. Such misconduct may either violate the conditions of an express contract, or it may be equally opposed and do equal violence to any implied engagement or ,t.xxu miixit, as it is technically called in the law of England, not from the express deter- mination of any court or the positive directions of any statute, but from natural reason and the just construction of law, which assumes and intends that every man has engaged what his duty or justice requires at his hands. And he must do this with integrity, dili- gence, and skill; for if, by his neglect, injury accrues to individuals, they have their remedy against him in damages. See CONTRACT, DUTY, OBLIGATION, DAMAGES, EQUITY, PF.IJFOUMANVE OF CONTRACTS. BRKACIL OF THE PEACE is an offense against the public tranquillity and safety, and is either felonious or not felonious. But the law on this subject will be best considered under PEACE, OFFENSES AGAINST THE PUBLIC. BREACH OF POUND is an indictable offense, and means the breaking any pound (q.v.) or place where cattle or goods distrained are deposited, in order to rescue them. When once impounded, such goods or cattle are understood to be in the custody of the law, and an action for treble damages \\\\ill lie for illegally taking them out of pound upon a distress for rent. Further, it is enacted by the <> and 7 Viet. c. 30, that if any person shall release, or attempt to release, cattle lawfully sei/.cd by way of such distress, from the pound or place where they shall be impounded, or on the way to or from such pound or place, or shall destroy such pound — he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £5, and in default, may be committed to the house of correction.

The earliest and most primitive way of making B. was to soak the grain in water, subject it to pressure, and then dry it by natural or artificial heat. An improve- ment upon this was to pound or bnnj the grain in a mortar or between two flat stones, befi.re moistening and heating, and from this brai/iny operation some etymologists pro- pose to derive the word bread (as if bnti/nl). A rather more elaborate bruising or grinding of the grain leads to such .simple forms of bread as the ont-cal.; * of Scotland, which are prepared by moistening oat-meal (coarsely brui>ed oats) with water containing some common salt, kneading with the hands upon a baking-board, rolling the mass into a thin sheet, and ultimately heating before a good tire, or on an iron plate, called a girdle, which is suspended above the fire. In a similar manner, the barley -meal and peas-meal bannocks of Scotland are prepared; and in the East Indies (especially the Punjab and Afghanistan), as well as in Scotland, Hour is kneaded with water, and rolled into thin sheets, as scones. The passoter cakes of the Israelites were also prepared in this way. A similar preparation of wheat-flour, but where the sheet of dough is made much thicker, forms the dampers of Australia. The Indian corn-meal, kneaded with water ami fired, affords the corn-bread of America. The kinds of B. referred to above are designated unleavened, as no leaven has been added to the dough to excite fermentation. Even in the time of Moses, however, lear> // was employed in making bread. It is held probable that the Egyptians were the first to use leaven\"; that the secret afterwards became known to the Greeks; and that the Greeks communicated the process to the Romans, who spread the invention far and wide in the northern countries during their campaigns. The grain of wheat is generally employed in the manufacture of B. among the better classes and more advanced nations, though rye. barley, Indian corn, and rice are also extensively used. The average composition of the grain of wheat when dried, so as to evaporate about 14 per cent of moisture, is — Gluten and albumen 13£ Starch 54| Gum, sugar, oil, and fiber 30 Saline matter 2 The proportion of these ingredients varies, however; and though the native country of wheat is unknown, yet it is found that within the wheat zone (see WHEAT), the quality improves as we travel south. Thus, Scotch wheat is inferior to English, the latter to French, that to the Italian; and the finest wheat in the world is grown in Barbary and Egypt. The principal constituents of wheat may be separated from each other without much difficulty. Thus, if wheat-flour be placed in a cloth-bag with the mouth well closed, and the whole introduced into a basin of water, and pressed by the fingers for some time, the starch is squeezed through the cloth as a fine white powder, and the gluten is left in the cloth as a viscid or sticky substance. Again, if wheat-flour be burned on a porcelain plate on a fire, or oven, or gas-lamp, till it can burn no longer, it leaves behind a small amount of ash or saline matter. operations, the wheat as it passes from grain to flour nearly doubles its bulk. The pro ducts come from the dressing-machine divided into different qualities, a quarter of wheat yielding — Bushels.

There is no bran in firsts, but a greater or less pro- portion of the finer bran in seconds and thirds. In the making of good B. three things. are absolutely requisite: flour or meal, veast or leaven, and water containing salt. The yeast (q.v.), or leaven (q.v.), is added to give a start to the fermentation (q.v.) process, thereby supplying carbonic; acid, which communicates a spon^v or liu-ht texture to the bread. Leaven is the more primitive ferment, and i^ simply a portion of moistened 1 O Breach. Bread. flour or dough in -which the putrefactive agencies have begun to work. It may be pro- cured by allowing moistened flour to lie in a warm apartment (summer heat) for six or eight days, and when sufficiently formed, has an acid taste and reaction, and a some- what fusty odor. When brought in contact with a new portion of flour and water, and incorporated therewith by kneading, it very quickly acts as a ferment, and develops partial fermentation in the whole. Hence it is that where leaven is used, it is custom- ary to retain a portion of the leavened dough for the next baking. On the continent, leaven is still very extensively employed, especially in districts far from breweries. In Britain, yca>t is generally used as the ferment. The materials being at hand, and the proper benches, utensils, and oven being within reach, the baker takes a quantity of water and adds to it the yeast and salt; after which the flour is added, and the whole thoroughly and laboriously kneaded together till it assumes a ropy consistence. It is then called\" the sponge, and is placed in a kneading- trough in a warm place, which is styled «#//<// lh< sponge. In a short time, the yeast begins to act on the gluten, starch, and sugar of the flour, compelling the latter to pass into alcohol and carbonic, acid gas in every part of the dough, which thereby becomes inflated with innumerable air cavities. When the fermentation has sufficiently advanced, the baker takes the sponge, adds more flour, water, and salt, and a second time subjects the whole to a thorough process of kneading, to prevent portions being so far fermented as to become sad, and again allows the mass to lie in a warm place for a few hours. The dough swells considerably from distension by gas, and is weighed out into lumps of the proper size, which are shaped into loaves, constituting the batch, or placed in tin pans, and are allowed to lie for a short time till they get further distended. The oven has previously been heated by lines, by heated air, or by wood being burned within it, to a temperature of at least :]20 F., which is the lowest temperature at which B. can be baked, and ranging up to 572 F. ; and when it has been thoroughly cleaned out, the loaves are introduced and placed on the floor, and the oven shut up. The heat acts in dissipating much of the water from the dough, in distending the air cavities more fully, and in partially boiling the starch and gluten of the dough, and developing some gum from the starch. Indeed, though the temperature of the oven is much higher, yet the loaves beyond the mere crust are bathed in an atmosphere of steam, and are never heated above 212 , as has been proved by direct experiments with the thermome- ter. One effect of the heat is to arrest any further fermentation (q.v. ; see also YEAST). After several hours' baking in the oven, the length of time being determined by the temperature, the loaves are withdrawn, and allowed to cool. The brown appearance of the crust of loaves, and the pleasant taste of the crusts, are due to the action of the heat on the starch and the formation of dextrine (q.v.), a sort of gum. The number of quartern (4 Ib.) loaves which a sack of flour weighing 280 Ibs. yields, is 90. It will be apparent, there fore, that as 280 Ibs. of flour yield :J60 Ibs. of B., that a good deal more water must be present in the latter than *in the former; and indeed, ordinary good wheaten B. contains about 45 per cent of water. This water is retained even after the loaf is apparently dry, and even mealy, as the gum and gluten have a great affinity for water. Improvements in the process of making B. are occasionally effected. Thus a form of yeast, called German barm or yeast (q.v. ), has been introduced, which is more cleanly than ordinary yeast or leaven, but appears to be too rapid in its power of causing fer- mentation to be manipulated easily in the making of ordinary loaves, though it does well for pan-loaves and fancy B. in general. Ovens heated by flues are being con- structed, instead of the primitive method of heating them by wood, which smokes the whole oven. Instead of raising the dough by the action of yeast, which decomposes a part of the flour and causes the loss of about 2 per cent, bicarbonate of soda and hydrochloric acid are sometimes employed. The proportion by this process are 4 Ibs. of flour intimately mixed with 320 grains of bicarbonate of soda: to this is added a mixture of 300 grains of common salt in 35 ozs. of water and 6i fluid drams of hydrochloric acid, sp.gr. 1.16, and the whole is kneaded and placed in the oven. When the mix- ture is made, the acid acts on the bicarbonate of soda, forming common salt, which is left in the dough, and carbonic acid is liberated at every point, and communicates a spongy texture to the dough. The disadvantage attendant on this mode of raising the dough is that it is apt to leave top much common salt in the bread. This is obviated by using water charged with carbonic acid, as described under AERATED BREAD. Sesqui- carbonate of ammonia is employed to some extent in the preparation of rusks, ginger- bread, and other light fancy B. : when heated, it entirely passes into gas, and thus yields a very spongy mass. Sftort-bread is prepared from flour which has been incorporated with butter. See UNFERMENTED BREAD. The appearance which good wheaten B. ought to present, is that of a vesicular or spongy mass, from which layers can be readily detached ; and this, known to bakers as piled B., is the best index of good wholesome and easily digested bread. When the layers cannot be detached, and the loaf cannot be crumbled down by the fingers into a coarse powder, or the fragments be thoroughly soaked and be readily diffused through water, but become a permanent tough mass of \"dough, the B. is imperfectly made. Rye B. is very extensively used m northern European countries, where the soil being sandy is admirably adapted for the growth of that grain. It yields a flour darker than: Bread. 1 A Bi« ad-fruit. wheat-flour. It is almost equal in nutritive value to wheaten bread. Barley and oats, •which when u>eil a< 15. are generally made into cakes or bannocks, possess also a composition not unlike wheat. Indian corn, which thrives luxuriantly on the Ameri- can soil, and is largely used there for B., as also to a considerable extent in the old world, is little different from wheat in the proportion of its ingredients. Rice is occa- sionally employed in making B. , but it is not nearly so nutritious as wheat. But although, with the exception of rice, the various kinds of grain do not sensibly differ in the amount of nutritious matter contained in the meal, yet there is a great difference as to the quality of yielding a light, spongy bread. In this respect, the flour of wheat excels all others. This quality seems to depend upon the mechanical structure of the gluten of wheat, which gives a glutinous, sticky consistency to the dough, rendering it impervious to the carbonic acid gas formed in it during the fermentation, so that the gas thus imprisoned swells it up. The meal of other grains forms a more granular and less tenaciou* dough, which allows the gas to escape with more or less ease as it is formed. It is thus impossible to make a light, spongy loaf of oatmeal, however finely it might be ground. In the case of whole-meal B. or brown B., the rough, hard particles of the bran interfere with the ordinary tenacious quality of wheaten-flour, and make the dough slightly porous, so that much of the gas escapes, and thus this kind of B. is never so much raised as B. of fine flour. ,BROWN. COMPOSITION, or WHOLE FLOUR B. is made from the ground but undressed wheat, and therefore contains the bran as well as the flour. Some years ago it was suggested, that as the bran contained more nitrogenized matter than the flour, the whole meal must be more nutritious than the finer flour alone. But that opinion is now considerably modified; for while it is true that the whole meal (bran and fine flour) contains chemically more nutritive matter than the fine flour alone, yet the gritty parti- cles that are present in the former, cause an unnatural irritation in the alimentary canal, and lead to a quicker evacuation of the but partially digested and absorbed food. This explains why brown B. possesses laxative properties, and why laborers fed on it consider that it makes them hungry soon again; they feel that it does not last in the stomach, and consequently think it has little nourishment in it. The i til nit, ni (ions of B. are various. Very commonly boiled potatoes are added to the flour and water in the making of the dough, and some consider that this yields a lighter and more palatable bread. It must remembered, however, that the addition of any substance of a nature foreign to the composition of any material is an adulteration (see next article); and that though potatoes may be supposed to improve the B., yet good B. can be made without them, and the addition of the potatoes lessens the nutritive value of the wheat-flour. Alum is occasionally added to the dough, to increase the whiteness and improve the general texture of the B. ; and this it appears to do by arresting the passage of the starch into gum and sugar, which tends to take place during the process of baking. In Belgium, sulphate of copper is often used for a similar purpose, but it is not employed in this country. All such admixtures are destructive of the nutritive value of a certain part of the B., and are injurious to the animal system. For the nutritive qualities of B. see NUTRITION and FOOD, and for biscuit-bread, see BISCUIT. The law on the subject of bread, so far as relates to England and Scotland, is regu- lated by a local act for London, the 3 Geo. IV. c. 106, the provisions of which are imitated by a general act for the country, the 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 37. These provisions are as follow: B. may be made of flour or meal of wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwheat, Indian corn, pease, beans, rice, or potatoes, or any of them, or with any common salt, pure water, eggs, milk, barm, leaven, potato or other j'east, and mixed in such propor- tions as bakers may think fit, and with no other ingredient or matter whatsoever; and with the exception of French or fancy B. and rolls, the B. so made must be sold by weight, and in no other manner. It has been settled by many recent cases that bakers must weigh the bread before selling it, whether asked by the customer or not to do so. For this purpose, they must provide in their shops, on or near the counter, a beam and scales, with proper weights, or other sufficient balance, in order that the same may be weighed in the presence of purchasers — a regulation that also applies to delivery of B. by cart or other conveyance; it being directed that the scales and weights shall be constantly carried in the cart or other conveyance, under a penalty, in either case, not exceeding £5. From this regulation, however, fancy B., or French B., or rolls, are also excepted. The act further provides that B. made of mixed meal or flour — that is, B. made wholly or partially of pease, or beans, or potatoes, or of any sort of corn or grain other than wheat — shall be marked with the large Roman letter \"M,\" under a penalty, in case this rule be neglected, of a sum not exceeding 10«. for every pound-weight of such mixed B. sold, and so on in proportion for any less quantity. From this regula tion, however, is excepted B. made of the meal or flour of wheat, in the making of which potato-yeast shall be used. The following are the enactments against the adulteration of B. : 1. No baker shall, in the making of B. for sale, use any mixture or ingredient whatsoever other than those above mentioned, under a penalty for every offense not exceeding £10, nor less than £5, with the alternative of imprisonment, with or without hard labor, for any time not exceeding six calendar months; and the offender's name, place of abode, and offense may be published in the local newspapers. 2. Any person adulterating corn-meal or i ~. Bread. Bread-fruit. flour, by the introduction of any ingredient not being the real produce of the corn or grain ; or any person selling meal or flour of one sort of corn or grain as the meal or flour of another sort, whether si-purate or mixed, shall forfeit and pay, according to the discre- tion of the magistrate or justice, a sum not exceeding £20, nor less than £5. 3. Magis- trates or justices of the peace, and also peace-officers authorized by warrant, may, at seasonable times iu the daytime, enter a baker's premises, and search for adulterated flour or B. ; and if any be found, the same may be seized, and carried with all convenient speed to the nearest resident magistrate or justice of the peace, to be disposed of as he may (hink proper, the penalties varying from £2 to £10, with alternative imprisonment for six months; the offenders' names may also be published. Parties obstructing such search of bakers' premises, or upon the occasion of the search, carrying away the adulterated tlour or B., are liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. Should it, however, appear that any offense against the act shall have been occasioned by the willful act or the neglect of the baker's journeyman or other servant, the magistrate may issue his warrant for bringing such servant before him, and, on conviction, may adjudge him to pay a reasonable sum to his master, by way of recompense. The adulteration of food act gives a more efficient mode of prosecuting these offenses, and exposing them, when detected. The act further provides that bakers shall not bake bread, rolls, or cakes, on the Lord's day; or, on any part of that day, after half -past one o'clock in the afternoon, sell such bread, rolls, or cakes: or bake meat, pies, or other victuals; or in any other manner exercise the trade of a baker, save and except so far as may be necessary by way of preparation for the following day's baking. For a first offense against this regulation, a penalty of 10s. shall be paid; for a second offense, 20s.; and for a third and every subse- quent offense, respectively, the penalty of 40*., together with the costs of prosecution, a portion of the penalty to be paid to the prosecutor, and the residue to be applied towards the poor-rate of the place. This regulation as to Sundays does not extend to Scot- land. The law of Ireland on the subject of this article is contained in several acts of the Irish parliament, the leading provisions of which are similar to the above. BREAD, AKMY. In camps and in barracks of any size, the bread for the army is baked on the spot by bakers of the supply sub-department of control organization. Though perhaps a little rough in its manufacture, the article supplied is made from the best ingredients, and is genuine and wholesome. On a march, the control bakeries sup- ply bread at the several halting-places. In smaller barracks, bread has to be obtained by contract, but the most vigorous supervision is exercised to secure proper quality. Formerly, army bread was notoriously bad. A contractor would sometimes send in a tender so low, in order to obtain the contract, that he could not possibly make good bread at a profit; and then he relied on small fees paid him by the soldiers as a means of obtaining better. This discreditable state of things was ascertained by a committee of inquiry some years ago; it was found that the average of army bread was not equal in quality to that of work-house bread. Steps were forthwith taken to remedy the evil; expe- riments were made to determine whether troops could bake their own bread in the field, and the result was the adoption of the present system of army baking. With the improvement of the bread, a visible amelioration in the health of the soldiers has taken place. BREAD-FRUIT TREE, Artocarpus incisa, a tree of the natural order artocarpacea (q.v.), a native of the islands of the Pacific ocean and of the Indian archipelago — one of the most important gifts of nature to tiie inhabitants of these regions, its fruit supplying the principal part of their food, and its inner bark a considerable part of their clothing, whilst its timber and its milky juice are also employed for economical purposes. The genus to which it belongs (artocarpus, Gr. , bread-fruit) is distinguished by having the male flowers in catkins, with a 2-leaved perianth and one stamen; the female flowers naked; the fruit roundish, fleshy, and tuberculated. The bread tree is a rather slender tree, of 40 to 50 ft. high, often rising almost half its height without a branch. It has large, pinnatifid leaves, frequently 12 to 18 in. long, dark green, and glossy. The fruit is generally oval, or nearly spherical, and about the size of a child's head. It is a sorozis, a compound or aggregate fruit formed from numerous flowers on a common axis, and is cov- ered with a roughish rind, which is marked with small square or lozenge-shaped divi- sions, having each a small elevation in the center; is at first green; when imperfectly ripened, brown; and when fully ripe, assumes a rich yellow hue. It is attached to the small branches of the tree by a short thick stalk, and hangs either singly or in clusters of two or three together. It contains a somewhat fibrous pulp, which, when ripe, becomes juicy and yellow, but has then a rotten taste. At an earlier stage, when the fruit is gathered for use, the pulp is white and mealy, and of a consistence resembling that of new bread. In a still less mature state, the fruit contains a tenacious white milk. The common practice in the South Sea islands is to cut each fruit into three or four pieces, and take out the core ; then to place heated stones in the bottom of a hole dug in the earth ; to cover them with green leaves, and upon this to place a layer of the fruit, then stones, leaves,and fruit alternately, till the hole is nearly filled, when leaves and earth to the depth of several inches are spread over all. In rather more than half an hour, the bread-fruit is Bread-nut. -| ft Breakwater. ready; \" the outsides are, in general, nicely browned, and the inner part presents a white or yellowish cellular pulpy sul»tance. in appearance slightly resembling the crumb of a wheateo loaf.\" It has little laste, but is frequently sweetish, and more resembles the Elantain than bread made of wheat-flour. It is slightly astringent, and highly nutritious, ometimes the inhabitants of a district join to make a prodigiou.- oven — a pit 20 or 30 ft. in circumference, the stones iu which are heated by wood burned in it, and many hun- dred bread-fruits are thrown in. and cooked at once. Baked in this manner, bread-fruit will keep good for several weeks. Another mode of preserving it is by subjecting it iu heaps to a slight degree of fermentation, and heating it into a kind of paste, which, although rather sour, is much used when fresh bread -iruit cannot be obtained. There are numerous varieties of the bread tree in the South Sea islands, and they ripen at dif- ferent seasons. The tree produces two, and sometimes three, crops a year. In the \\Ve>t Indies and South America, into which it has also been introduced, the bread-fruit has not come much into use as an ordinary article of food; but various preparations of it are reckoned delicacies. — The fibrous inner bark of young bread fruit trees, beaten and prepared, is used for making a kind of cloth, which is much worn by the common peo- ple in the South Sea islands, though inferior in softness and whiteness to t hat made from the paper mulberry (see MULBERRY, PAPKH). — There exudes from the bark of the bread tree, when punctured, a thick mucilaginous fluid, which hardens by exposure to the air, and is used, when boiled with cocoa-nut oil, for making the seams of canoe-. pails, etc., water-tight, and as bird-lime. — The timber is soft and light, of a rich yellow color, and assumes, when exposed to air, the appearance of mahogany. It is used for canoes, house-building, furniture, and many other purposes. It is durable when not exposed to the weather. — The JACK (q.v.) or Jaca (^1. intujrifoiin), and the DEPHAL (.1. lokoocJid), both large East Indian trees, belong to the same genus with the bread-fruit tree. BREAD-NUT, the fru\\tofbro8imumalica*trum, a tree of the natural order artoi'<uT and therefore allied to the bread-fruit, a native of Jamaica. The genus hroxiii/n/it is dis- tinguished by male and female flowers on separate trees, in globose catkins, with peltate (shield-like) scales for perianth, and the fruit a one-seeded drupe. The bread-nut tree has ovate-lanceolate evergreen leaves; it abounds in a tenacious gummy milk. Its leaves and young shoots are much eaten by cattle, but deleterious qualities are devel- oped in them as they become old. The nuts, boiled or roasted, form an agreeable article of food, and are eaten instead of bread. Their taste resembles that of hazel -nuts. — To this genus the polo de vaca,- or Cow TREE (q.v.), of Demerara is supposed also to belong. BREAD-ROOM. In the navy, the biscuits are called bread, and the place where they are stored is the bread-room; it is carefully constructed, warmed before being filled, and kept as much as possible free from damp. BREAD-ROOT. See PSORALEA. BREADTH, in art, is a term which, though often used in a very indefinite manner, is not without a definite meaning. It signifies that peculiar disposal of the background of a picture which, without sacrificing or even concealing details, gives to the whole unity and harmony of effect. With the older landscape-painters, it was a common fault to produce the effect of distance either bv a certain trick of light and shadow, or by one uniform hazy color in which the individual objects were entirely lost to view' and fimnlth became vacancy. In this respect, their pictures contrast unfavorably with those of such modern painters as Turner, of whom Mr. Ruskin has very truly said that \" the conception of every individual inch of distance is absolutely clear and complete in the master's mind — a separate picture fully worked out: but yet, clearly and fully as the idea is formed, just so much of it is given, and no more, as nature would have allowed us to feel or see; just so much as would enable a spectator of experience and knowledge to understand almost every minute fragment of separate detail, but appears to the unpracticed and careless eye just what a distance of nature's own would appear — an unintelligible mass. Not one line out of the millions there is without meaning, yet there is not one which is not affected and disguised by the dazzle and indecision of distance. No form is made out, and yet no form is unknown.\" On the subject of breadth Mr. Ruskin has, moreover, the following very judicious remarks: \"It were to be wished that our writers on art would not dwell so frequently on the necessity of breadth, without explaining what it means, and that we had more constant reference made to the princi- ple, which I can only remember having seen once clearly explained and insisted on — that breadth is not vacancy. Generalization is unity, not destruction of parts; and com- position is not annihilation, but arrangement of materials. The breadth which unites the truths of nature with her harmonies is meritorious and beautiful, but the breadth which annihilates those truths by the million is not painting nature, but painting over her; and so the masses which result from right concords and relations of details are sublime and impressive, but the masses which result from the eclipse of details are con- temptible and painful.\" BREAD-TREE. See CAFFER BREAD. BREAKERS, in maritime language, are the waves that break violently over rocks lying a short distance under the surface of the sea. They cover that particular part of 1 *7 Bread-imt. Breakwater. the sea with a foam, and produce a hoarse and often terrible roaring. \" Breakers ahead \" is one of the most alarming announcements made by the lookout men of a ship, seeing that the B. denote the existence of sunken rocks which may, perchance, pierce the hull of the vessel. BREAKING BULK, in the Scotch law, signifies making use of an article supplied in bulk, or in quantity; by which act one is said to breaklnilk, and is, in consequence, prevented from afterwards objecting to it, and returning it to the seller. See SALE OF GOODS. BREAKING INCLOSURES is an expression to be found in Scotch law-books, and means tin- destruction or invasion of planting and inclosures by persons or their cattle. Tlu- punixhment for this offense is provided for by several old Scotch statutes, the prin- cipal of which are two pas>ed in li.til and 16K5 respectively, The penalties are pecu- niary, with right to detain the cattle found trespassing, until such penalties, along with the damage and costs, are paid. See PLANTATION. BREAKWATER is a barrier intended for the protection of shipping in harbors or anchorages. It sometimes happens that, in front of a semicircular bay, a small island is so situated as to form a natural breakwater. This is to some extent the case with the isle of Wight, which occupies such a position as to protect Portsmouth and Southamp- ton from the south. In many other places, however, bays and harbors are without such screens. A pier may be so placed and constructed as to* serve also the purpose of a B., but the term B. is generally confined to a structure used solely for protection, and not for berthage or traffic, and breakwaters are frequently insulated*, so as to be cut off from any communication with the shore unless by water. Plymouth B. is the best known of these engineering works. The sound or harbor, being open to the s., was so much exposed to storms that, early in the present century, it was determined to construct a B. across its mouth, with openings between it and the shore, on either side, for the ingress and egress of shipping. The works were com- menced in 1812. The operations consisted in transporting along a tram-road large blocks of limestone got from a neighboring quarry, shipping them in vessels fitted with trap- doors, and by means of these depositing them in the shape of a huge mound in the required .-ituation. As soon as the stones began to appear above water, a perceptible benefit resulted in the relative calmness of the sound during the prevalence of storms; but the siructure was frequently very roughly handled by the waves, which altered and flattened its shape. A -evcre storm in Nov.. 1*24, threw a great portion of the stones over into the sound. It was not until 1841 that the works were finally completed, by the deposition of more than 3,000.000 tons of stone, and the expenditure of nearly £1,500,000. The B. is nearly a mile long, the central portion is 1000 yards; and two wing-, of :3.\"iO yards each, extend from the ends of this at a slight angle. The open channels at each end, between the B. and the shore, are each about half a mile wide, and their depth is respectively 40 and 22 ft., at low water. The B. is 133 yards wide at the base, and 15 at the top — the two sides being made very sloping for the security of the stones. The slopes and top are faced with masonry. The water space protected by this B. comprises 1120 acres, and it is generally admitted that the money has been well spent on the work. Holyhead B. is formed of stone quarried in Holyhead mountain, drawn along a tram- way on a timber structure, and cast into the sea. It more resembles a pier than the B. at Plymouth, for it is attached at one end to the shore, and is intended to convert Holy- head \"bay or roadstead into a harbor of refuge. The works consist of a mound of loose stones up to low water, and ashlar upright walls with a parapet above that line, with a railway on the top for trains. Portland B. is of very great value, in converting into a harbor of refuge the expanse of water between the Dorsetshire coast and the isle, or rather peninsula of Portland. An act of parliament was obtained in 1847, authorizing the works. The B., starting from the n.e. point to the isle, stretches nearly due n. for more than 2 m., with one or two intervening openings for the ingress and egress of shipping. The works were conducted more easily than those of any other great B. ; for the isle contains an abund- ance of stone easily quarried, and the steep shores afforded facility for transporting the stones by their own gravity to their destination. The work — which is an upright ashlar superstructure, with a parapet founded on a mound of rubble stones — was done chiefly by convict labor; the depth is about 50 ft. at low-water. From the nature of the opera- tion, any part of the B. became useful as soon as constructed, increasing the safety of Portland bay as a harbor of refuge. Dover B. progresses slowly, and has involved an enormous outlay. There is no stone near to form a mound, as in \"the other breakwaters spoken of, and\", in consequence, the work requires to be brought up in soild ashlar from the bottom by the diving-bell, with the interior formed of blocks of concrete. It has never been clearly stated whether the government regards this B. as a protection to a great naval station and fortified harbor, or a- a chief feature as a harbor of refuge for commercial fleets. In 1844, a commission of inquiry recommended that i'0. 500, 000 should belaid out in forming a harbor of refuge at this place. In 30 years the work has not been finished, the great depth and frequent storms constituting terrible obstacles. The water is very deep — viz., 42 ft. at low-water; the U. K. III.— 2 j;rcl;ik\\va:.T. 18 accumulations of shingle very troublesome: and several years must elapse before it can be made evident whether the Dover B. is worth the national money expended upon it. Alderuey B. is a givat work, con.>isting of ashlar wall.: and parapet, built on a stone mound up to low-water from a depth of 72- feet. Small breakwaters have been con- structed at ( Vile near Marseilles, at the mouth of the Delaware- in the United States, and at Buffalo in lake Erie; but they do not call for description. rherboun: P.. is the greatest \"ami the most costly ever constructed. Nearly 100 years ago, M. tie Ce-virt proposed to the French government the formation of a B. at Cher- bciurg, to IMJ commenced by the construction of a number of hollow cones formed of timber-framing, sunk in a line as close as they could be placed to each other, and then filled with stones. These cones, of which there were to be 64, each about 70 ft. hi:_rh, l.\">0 ft. in diameter at the base, and 60 ft. at the top, were intended to form a nucleus to •re.-ikwater. t<> prevent the stones, during its formation, being knocked about and to» much spread out by the action of the waves. In 1784 to 1788, 16 cones were con- structed, and 13 of them sunk, but so great was the destruction which they underwent during stormy weather, that the government at length abandoned the plan, and carried on the stone break water without the aid of the cones. It was completed under Napoleon III. at a cot exceeding £2,500,000. The B. itself was finished in 18.\">3. but since that year larire fortifications have been built upon the upper works. The length is nearly 2* in. ; the B. is 300 ft. wide at the bottom, and 31 at the top. The chief mass consists of rubble or unshaped stones, thrown down from ships; but there is a larger ratio of wrought and finished masonry than in the Plymouth B., consisting of granite blocks imbedded in cement. The depth of water is about 60 ft. at low-water spring-tides; and the B. rises to 12 ft. above high-water level. The water-space included within and protected by the B., is about 2000 acres, but two thirds of this has scarcely depth enough for the large-t-si/ed ships. The relation which this B. bears to the vast military and naval arran, ! the place will be noticed under CHERBOIKI.. Many sub-mutes have been proposed for solid breakwaters, such as floating break- waters constructed of timber framework, open iron screens, etc., but none of them have been .shown to be suitable for actual practice. Close timber-work, filled iu with stones, is found to be quite efficacious; but on most of our coasts the timber is liable to be eaten by the marine worm, which is an almost insuperable objection to its being used under water. BREAKWATER (ante). In the United States the only important work of the kind is at Lewes, Del., at the entrance of Delaware bay. A breakwater was resolved upon in 1828, and the next year the site was fixed at cape Henlopeu. In 1870, the engineer reported the completion of the harbor \"according to the original project devised more than 40 years ago.\" In the year after the completion, more than 20,000 vessels visited the harbor, and since its first use in 1833, about 300,000 vessels of all sorts have sought shelter or trade behind the Delaware breakwater. A recent report says: \"Let a threat- ening sky foretell the approaching storm, and a few hours will suffice'to fill a previously vacant harbor. Let a north-easterly storm continue a day or two with severity, and the harbor becomes crowded entirely beyond its capacity.\" Its present capacity is' deter- mined by the space that is sheltered by the B. proper. This is a straight line nearly half a rcile long, and may be taken as the diameter of a half circle behind it, the area of which will represent approximately the sheltered harbor. North-east of the B. is the ice- oreaker structure, a quarter of a mile in length, with an opening of about the same extent, through which the sea rolls without hindrance. Within the past five or six years this important work has been much extended and improved. It is altogether of stone, in rabble-wall and more finished work. There are finished or in construction several B.'s in the northern lakes, for the most part made of timber cribs filled with stone. BREAM, a name which is apt to occasion some confusion to beginners in ichthyology, being applied equally to certain fresh-water fishes of the family cyprinidw (q.v.), and to certain .-i -a -fishes of the families upaiidce (q.v.)ande/wEto<fo/i&tfa!(q.v.)or squamipennes among which the resemblance is a mere general one of outward form, the first of these families belonging to the order of malacopterous, or soft-finned, the other two to that of acanthopterouB, or spiny-finned fishes. The breams of the family cyprinidce were included in the genus r>/f,rin>i* (see C\\RP) by the older naturalists, but are readily distinguished from that genus as now defined, and from other allied genera, by their deep and compressed form, by the <nvat convexity of both the dorsal and the abdominal outline, by the want of spiny ravs in the dorsal and anal fins, by the great length of the base of the anal fin, and by the want of cirri or bar- bules at the mouth. They form the genus Abramis of Cuvier. — The COMMON B., or CARP B. (A. brama), is an inhabitant of many rivers and lakes of Europe even as far n as Norway and Sweden, and of some of those of Britain and Ireland. It thrives best in still waters, and in some of the Irish lakes attains a large size; it has been known to reach 12 or even 14 Ibs. The tail is very broad and much forked, the head small and acuminated, the eyes very large, the scales small, the general color yellowish-brown, the cheeks and gill-covers silvery-white.— The WHITE B., or BREAMFLAT (A. bltcca), differs from the common B. in its silvery color, the smaller number of rays in the pecto- ral and anal fins, and other particulars. It has never been taken of so large a size. It is 1 Q Breakwater. Breast-summer. found in many parts of the continent of Europe, and in some of the British lakes and rivers. — The POMERANIAN P>. (A. buijijeiihagii) differs much more widely from the com rnon B. ; the body is much thicker in proportion to its depth, the scales larger, the base of the anal tin shorter, the tail less forked. This fish is known to occur in a few places of England and Ireland, and is said to abound in Pomerania. The acauthopterous breams, or SEA BKEAMS, are mostly of the family xp<iri<lu', and nearly allied to the gilthead (q.v.), in connection with which they may most properly be noticed. . The common sea B., indeed, often receives the name of gilthead. Only one of the British sea fishes called B., the bra/ma raii already noticed (see BKAMA), belongs to the I'amily chatodontidcB. Angling f»r Bream. — Of the two kinds of B. known to anglers, the carp 15. is much the best for sport. The flesh of the B. is not held in much estimation, though the carp B. is infinitely to be preferred of the two. B. are found in both ponds and rivers. They prefer deep, still holes, or quiet, well-sheltered eddies in the bends of rivers. Here the angler will find them in large numbers. They are rather capricious in feeding; at times they will not bite for weeks together. Being a sly, shy-biting fish, the tackle required for them must be fine. They may be taken by means of the ledger (q.v.) in rivers, where they should be fished for in the same way as directed for barbel, save that, it will be found advisable to use another hook, which should be fastened on to the line about 8 in. or a foot above the ledger lead, as B. often take their bait some inches oil' the bottom. The hooks should be No. 7. In float-fishing for B. in holes or eddies, a stout swan-quill float and half a dozen No. 1 shot below it, will be found sufficient for the purpose; and, having ground-baited as directed for barbel, put on two small red worms for the angling bait, or about an inch of the tail of a bright, well-scoured lob- worm. The former is preferable. Two hooks, one to rest on the bottom, and one 6 or S in. off it, will be found useful, for sometimes one will be taken, and sometimes the other. The fish being tender-mouthed, should be played gently. After the first rush, a B. soon tires, for his form is not fitted or shaped for a prolonged resistance. The B. has an unpleasant practice of bowing downwards and rubbing the line with his tail, and the line often comes up covered with a thick slime from his body, for a foot or more above the hook. It is needless to remark that this must be cleared off before the tackle is again used. The rod should be a light cane-rod, moderately stiff, and some 12 or 13 ft. long for float-fishing for B. from a boat or punt. Of all baits, worm is decidedly the I test. Some recommend bullock's blood and grains to ground bait with, but worms are found to answer all purposes. B. spawn about the end of May, choosing the most weedy spots for that purpose; and after scouring and cleansing in some gentle gravelly stream for a week or two, they return to the deep still holes again. A clay or sandy bottom is preferred to any other. The presence of B. may always be detected by their fondness for coming at times to the top of the water, or, as anglers term it, \" priming.\" Early in the morning, or late in the evening, the whereabouts of B. may always be discovered by their rising then. In Lough Erne the shoals are prodigious, and cause a ripple on the water like a stiff breeze of wind. BREAMING, in nautical affairs, is a cleansing process which a ship undergoes after a voyage, or after lying for a long time in harbor. The ship's bottom, under such circum- stances, often becomes covered with grass, ooze, shells, or sea-weed; and B. consists in the removal of these impurities. The ship is laid aground after the tide has ebbed, or is docked, or is careened (see CAREENING); furze and fagots are placed under it; fire is applied; the heat melts the pitch, etc., of the hull, and the pitch and filth can then be scraped and brushed off. BREAST, THE FEMALE, or mammary gland, consists of a series of tubes, radiating from a common center, the nipple, which is situated in an areola or dark-colored patch. On the surface of the latter are several (from 4 to 10) sebaceous glands, which secrete an unctuous fluid to protect the skin of the nipple, which is very thin, from the saliva of (lie sucking infant. The m\\\\k-t>tbes (15 to 18 in number) enlarge into sinuses, and pass each to a separate lobe or subdivision of the breast, where they divide into twigs and brunches (the /tict/fi'n/ns <ln<-tx), which end in minute vesicles. The lobes are held together by fibrous tissue, and are well packed in fat, which increases sometimes to an enormous extent the apparent size of the organ. It will be readily understood how over-distension of these delicate tubes, from whatever cause, must be productive of great suffering. When an abscess forms in the B. , it is very dangerous to allow the matter to remain ; \"but when an opening is made into an abscess of the B., the cut must be made in some line radiating from the nipple, so as to avoid division of the milk-tubes. BREASTPLATE, in ancient armor, was a plate of iron, steel, or other metal, so fastened as to protect the chest or front of the wearer. The back-plate, in like manner, •was worn to protect him from attack from behind. In modern European armies, almost the only representative of the B. is the front half of the cuirass, worn by the citirtiKxiers in certain foreign states, and by the household cavalry (life-guards and horse- guards) in England. BREA.ST-STJMMEE, BRESSUMER (Fr. sommier, a lintel), a beam supporting the whole front of a building, in the same way in which a lintel supports the portion over an Breast. OA Breda. - u opening. They are seen in England and on the continent in old houses that are built partly of wood and partly of stone, brick, or mud. BREAST NVIIKKI.. See WATER POWEK, ante. BREASTWORK, in fortification, is a hastily constructed earthwork; not so high as to need a banij>i<ttf (q.v.) for the defenders to stand upon, but sufficient to afford shelter when they are standing on the level of the ground, and firing over the crest. The dry ditch or trench from which the earth has been taken to form, the B., affords au addi- tional defense. A B. is midway between a imrapet and an ep<iulnn< nt, in size and importance.
