Gajus sacrificed time (it took a year and a half to recruit some board members) and money (settling for a lower valuation from a better VC) to assemble the right team.\n\nWorthington, Gajus, To MBA or Not?: Technical Degree or MBA 2004-03-07 870\n\nTo MBA or Not?: Technical Degree or MBA\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nWorthington would not trade his technical degree for an MBA. He sees entrepreneurship being about breaking many of the rules that one learns in business school. He sees being able to lead as much more important to having an MBA, and suggests practical experience as a better alternative.\n\nWorthington, Gajus, Envisioning the Future: Other Potential Applications of the Technology 2004-03-07 871\n\nEnvisioning the Future: Other Potential Applications of the Technology\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe applications for the Fluidigm technology may be far from being realized, says Worthington. Fluidigm is currently working on high-throughout methodologies, like genome screening and protein-protein interactions, as well as what could turn out to be breakthrough science: using rubber pumps to simulate body functions to trick cells into thinking they are inside the body, he says.\n\nWorthington, Gajus, How Do You Establish a Decision-Making Process? 2004-03-07 879\n\nHow Do You Establish a Decision-Making Process?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThough the Fluidigm executive staff was incredibly bright and talented, says Worthington, they initially were almost incapable at making decisions and constantly argued. Worthington decided that the only solution was to set up a decision making process. He set a timeline for the decision, organized the staff into teams, and gave them specific instructions to evaluate the options. Each team performed wonderfully and the process even spurred invention, he notes.\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., The Decision to Become a Lawyer in Silicon Valley 2004-05-26 881\n\nThe Decision to Become a Lawyer in Silicon Valley\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGordon caught the startup bug while working for Measurex, but wondered if there was a way he could work for multiple startups at a time, as an advisor for many companies rather than as an executive at just one. He attended law school and Apple was one of his first clients. He deeply regrets not accepting Steve Job's request to pay the $500 legal fees in stock instead of cash!\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., Entrepreneurs Must Have Drive and Perseverance to Be Successful 2004-05-26 884\n\nEntrepreneurs Must Have Drive and Perseverance to Be Successful\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGordon discusses companies he believes exemplify outstanding drive and perseverance.

Intuit has a relentless commitment to the customer that has led the company through tough times.\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., The Ins and Outs of Financing a Company 2004-05-26 885\n\nThe Ins and Outs of Financing a Company\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nScott Cook and Tom Proulx of Intuit approached Gordon for advice on what venture capital to accept. Gordon recommended they accept the funding based on the two lowest valuations for the company because the offers came from Doerr, John and Burt McMurty, two of the best venture capitalists in the business. Even at the lower valuation, Gordon predicted that the leadership from these two men would more than make up for the lost profits in the long run.\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., Taking Your Company to a New Level: The IPO 2004-05-26 886\n\nTaking Your Company to a New Level: The IPO\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGoogle has decided to IPO though the Dutch auction method, which has never been done for such a large-scale offering. In the Dutch auction method, each buyer makes a blind bid for what they are willing to pay. The seller then finds a clearing price for how many shares they want to sell, and the people with bids above that price are awarded stock. The method is designed to avoid the tremendous first day stock price volatility experienced by newly-public companies.\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., The Role of Lawyers in the Startup Ecosystem 2004-05-26 888\n\nThe Role of Lawyers in the Startup Ecosystem\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nIn addition to handling the legal work, lawyers help companies get off the ground by making introductions for founders of start-ups to potential investors, mentors, and accountants.

He worries that people will artificially inflate their bids if they know that the company is planning on giving each bidder only a percentage of what they ask. He also speculates that the institutional investors may not bid, but will wait until the market settles. Whatever the case, there is not yet enough data to convincingly predict when a Dutch auction will be successful.\n\nDavidson, Gordon K., What Should an Engineer Know About Law and Business? 2004-05-26 894\n\nWhat Should an Engineer Know About Law and Business?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGordon recommends that everyone understand the basics of stock, financings, intellectual property protection, and the necessary ecosystem to launch a company. He also suggests having role models and understanding the mentality and infrastructure that makes Silicon Valley so conducive to startups.\n\nFrancis, Donald P., A Tale of Two Markets for AIDS Vaccine (Developed vs. Developing World) 2004-01-28 898\n\nA Tale of Two Markets for AIDS Vaccine (Developed vs. Developing World)\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe major market for the AIDS vaccine is in the developing world, says Francis, but there is significant demand in the United States with 40,000 new cases a year. There are a lot of unknowns in the business climate in the United States affecting the profitability of a vaccine. It is difficult to encourage investment when a blockbuster drugs would have a much higher rate of return, he adds.\n\nFrancis, Donald P., Bush and 9/11 Put AIDS on the Back Burner - And a New Social Venture is Born 2004-01-28 901\n\nBush and 9/11 Put AIDS on the Back Burner - And a New Social Venture is Born\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nFrancis talks about how after 9/11, the government became interested in vaccines. Vaxgen shifted to making a small pox vaccine and an anthrax vaccine and has been very successful in these pursuits. Unfortunately, AIDS was not named as an immediate concern and was but on the back burner. Due to the unwillingness of both the government and private businesses to provide funding, Francis has now decided that the AIDS vaccine cannot be developed in the private sector and is founding a non-profit foundation to pursue the development of the vaccine for less developed parts of the world.\n\nFrancis, Donald P., Intellectual Property Issues Between Vaxgen and the New Social Venture 2004-01-28 902\n\nIntellectual Property Issues Between Vaxgen and the New Social Venture\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nFrancis explains there are IP issues associated with forming the new venture, but since they are working for the less-developed world the licenses were given free of charge.\n\nFrancis, Donald P., Non-profit vs. Free Market: The Gates Foundation Changes the Game 2004-01-28 905\n\nNon-profit vs. Free Market: The Gates Foundation Changes the Game\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nNeither private investors nor the government was willing to make the necessary investment in the vaccine, says Francis. Therefore, Francis and his team had to look elsewhere for funding. The formation of the Gates Foundation has provided the desired alternative.\n\nFrancis, Donald P., Career Advice: Follow Your Passion and Come to the Bay Area! 2004-01-28 909\n\nCareer Advice: Follow Your Passion and Come to the Bay Area!\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nFrancis urges inspiring entrepreneurs to follow their passion. He comments on how difficult it is to follow a social cause in a society based on capitalism. The Bay Area is unique in its climate of venture capitalism and risk-seizing attitude.\n\nRaikes, Jeff, The Value of Broad-Based Leadership and Experience. 2004-05-05 917\n\nThe Value of Broad-Based Leadership and Experience.\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nBroad-based leadership is important to the success of a venture, says Raikes. Though everyone cannot have every skill, it is important to bring together a leadership team that has both a broad and deep set of experiences. Still, people should be hired more because they are passionate about what they do and willing to work hard, rather than their experiences.\n\nRaikes, Jeff, Choosing the Path That is Right for You 2004-05-05 920\n\nChoosing the Path That is Right for You\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nFind what you have a passion for and find a company that represents that, says Raikes. Life is too short to focus on money. Interviewers look for three things: high energy, high horse power, and the ability to get things done. It is nice to have relevant experience, but it is more important to be really passionate and willing to learn quickly, he adds.\n\nRaikes, Jeff, Can a Company Be Successful at Both Software and Hardware? 2004-05-05 921\n\nCan a Company Be Successful at Both Software and Hardware?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nRaikes talks about how companies can be successful at software and hardware, but only within a certain scope. If you're looking at the overall market, it has to be either hardware or software, he says. Within a niche, it is sometimes important to do both.\n\nHennessy, John L., Faculty and Startups: Conflict of Interest or Conflict of Commitment? 2004-04-21 923\n\nFaculty and Startups: Conflict of Interest or Conflict of Commitment?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nHennessy answers the question: Can the walls between Stanford and Silicon Valley ever become too permeable? Yes, he says, there are situations in which a conflict of interest or conflict of commitment can cause problems. The break between academia and business should occur when the focus of the research becomes about productizing the research rather than about the research itself.\n\nHennessy, John L., A Good Team Needs Technical and Non-technical People 2004-04-21 925\n\nA Good Team Needs Technical and Non-technical People\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nA good entrepreneurial company requires a variety of people with diverse skills, says Hennessy. Though there is a natural tendency to focus on the technology side of the company, non-engineering people are just as critical as the engineering people. In addition, the success of a venture is not based solely on the skills of the technical employees, but on the ability of the team to work together.\n\nHennessy, John L., If You're So Smart, How Come You're Not Rich? 2004-04-21 926\n\nIf You're So Smart, How Come You're Not Rich?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nHennessy answers the question: How do you get people to stay at Stanford when there is so much opportunity in the business sphere? He remarks that companies are great things, but they are missing most of what makes a university so appealing to its employees: the freshness and excitement of the students and the freedom to conduct one's own research.\n\nHennessy, John L., The Way to Predict the Future is to Invent It 2004-04-21 927\n\nThe Way to Predict the Future is to Invent It\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nHennessy predicts that the internet revolution is only half over. The remaining opportunities will be harder to find, but there is still a big impact to be made. Computers are still way too complicated and could be doing a lot more for the user. Wireless technology will increase mobility. In order to allow the continuation of increased performance in computing, there will have to be some major changes in technology.\n\nWirt, Ken, Examples of When Convergence Works and When it Does Not 2004-02-03 935\n\nExamples of When Convergence Works and When it Does Not\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThough some types of convergence devices become extremely popular, says Wirt, others never catch on. In certain cases, it is clear why the convergence device has never caught on (like a washer-dryer combo), and in others it is not so clear (like why people never use the built-in calculators on their cell phones), he adds.\n\nWirt, Ken, How Do You Compete Against More Established Competitors? 2004-02-03 948\n\nHow Do You Compete Against More Established Competitors?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nWirt explains that PalmOne has competed in the wireless forum by forming close relationships with the carriers to provide solutions that are integrated into their network. The largest market is largely saturated, so wireless companies are looking for additional services to offer their customers, and this is what PalmOne provides.\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, What Does it Mean to Be a Virtual CEO? 2004-04-28 992\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Be a Virtual CEO?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nKomisar, Randy, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, explains his title of Virtual CEO, which does not have a specific meaning. It is extremely adaptive and evolves to his changing roles. The purpose of the title was to provide a sort of identity on a business card that he could point at and say \"this is what I do.\"\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, Virtual CEO: First Questions to Ask Yourself About Your Business 2004-04-28 994\n\nVirtual CEO: First Questions to Ask Yourself About Your Business\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nAccording to Komisar, he provides the biggest value to companies at the beginning, and his value diminishes as the company grows and becomes more operational. He initially focuses on helping companies develop an overall strategy and business plan at a conceptual level. As the company evolves, he becomes more of the problem solver, rather than the generalist.\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, The Biggest Successes are Often Bred from Failures 2004-04-28 996\n\nThe Biggest Successes are Often Bred from Failures\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nAccording to Komisar, what distinguishes the Silicon Valley is not its successes, but the way in which it deals with failures. The Valley is about experimentation, innovation, and taking new risks. Only a small business that can deal with failure and still make money can exist in this environment. It is a model based on many, many failures and a few extraordinary successes.\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, How Do You Find Your Passion and How Do You Pursue It? 2004-04-28 1000\n\nHow Do You Find Your Passion and How Do You Pursue It?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nInstead of thinking about the passion, expalins Komisar, free yourself to think of a portfolio of passions. Marry this portfolio with the opportunities in front of you, he says.

Strategy consulting exists because senior management wants their strategy to be accepted by a board of directors. Contrastingly, Komisar's role is to come up with bold ideas and steer the direction of the company.\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, The Role of Networking to Find the Best Resources 2004-04-28 1002\n\nThe Role of Networking to Find the Best Resources\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nTo find companies to work with, Komisar engages in a sort of dating process. First, the company has to be referred to him by a trusted source. Second, he holds a meeting in order to get to know the person and find out what they are trying to do with the business. Komisar is only interested if the business is an interesting opportunity and the person is someone who has merit and can make a difference. This process of getting to know the founder can take months before Komisar is willing to commit.\n\nKomisar, Randy, 1954-, Should a Start-up Focus on Going Global Right Away? 2004-04-28 1003\n\nShould a Start-up Focus on Going Global Right Away?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nAccording to Komisar, globalization needs to be part of the tool set for every entrepreneur doing a start-up today. This doesn't mean immediately going global, but understanding the global market and having a plan for the future, he adds.\n\nLevchin, Max, 1975-, How We Attracted Our First People 2004-01-21 1023\n\nHow We Attracted Our First People\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe founders built the initial team of six by recruiting people they knew and trusted.

In order to be successful in technical innovation, says Page, you must understand the business and marketing side of the equation.\n\nSchmidt, Eric, 1955 April 27-, How Does Google Actually Make Money? 2002-05-01 1081\n\nHow Does Google Actually Make Money?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGoogle makes money through selling targeted advertising on its site, which is more effective than broad-based advertising. In addition, they receive revenue from providing search capabilities to other companies, says co-founder Larry Page. Surprisingly, the model used today is remarkably similar to the original business model presented to venture capitalists.\n\nSchmidt, Eric, 1955 April 27-, What Would You Change to Make Google More Successful? 2002-05-01 1083\n\nWhat Would You Change to Make Google More Successful?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nEverything at Google has turned out perfectly, making it hard to determine which decisions were good and which were bad. Co-founder Larry Page remarks that they could have started the company earlier, but were working on their PhD's. Also, it would have been difficult to achieve the same thing five years ago because the market was not as advanced -- and technology was more expensive and less established.\n\nSchmidt, Eric, 1955 April 27-, Hiring: What Attributes Do You Look For? 2002-05-01 1090\n\nHiring: What Attributes Do You Look For?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nThe first aspect Google considers when hiring is evaluating the applicant's capability of simply doing the job. Next, they look for people who can think outside the box, but still work within Google culture. Third, communication skills are critical for any employee, even engineers. Overall, co-founder Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt have found that if someone is exceptional at something, it is usually a good indicator that they are exceptional at everything.\n\nSchmidt, Eric, 1955 April 27-, Envisioning the Future for Google: Always a Search Engine? 2002-05-01 1091\n\nEnvisioning the Future for Google: Always a Search Engine?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nGoogle will always be a search engine, despite any additional directions the company may take, because it is a critical part of the mission the founders Page and Brin have defined. Also, says the company, the search engine is far from perfect and still requires many developments before it is complete.\n\nSchmidt, Eric, 1955 April 27-, Learning to Take Risks: A personal Story 2002-05-01 1094\n\nLearning to Take Risks: A personal Story\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nLooking back, it is easy to forget the tremendous risks co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin undertook to get to the place they are today. The co-founders once caused the whole Stanford network to go down for a significant amount of time while trying to develop Google.

Though Chinese and Indian companies are threatening their American counterparts, Jensen is enthusiastic about NVIDIA's long-term viability. He does not believe that the industry is particularly scalable; having a thousand engineers is not as important as having the right engineers, and there is an advantage to being in the Silicon Valley where there is a spirit of innovation.\n\nHuang, Jensen, Positioning NVIDIA as More Than a PC-Based Company 2003-01-29 1132\n\nPositioning NVIDIA as More Than a PC-Based Company\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nWill NVIDIA have to re-position itself with the slowing of the PC industry?

Voice Stream was a small company looking for something innovative to differentiate themselves from the competition. They found that innovation in Hiptop. Danger initially treated them as a partner rather than a customer. The two companies provided valuable services to each other and the deal solidified Danger's business plan. Since Hiptop was still in development at the time of the deal, Voice Stream was able to contribute to the product design, including giving it voice capabilities, which was not in the original design.\n\nHershenson, Matt, How the Wireless Markets Evolved in US, Europe, and Asia 2004-02-18 1142\n\nHow the Wireless Markets Evolved in US, Europe, and Asia\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nDanger was able to break into the US market by convincing wireless carriers to adopt a fixed rate pricing scheme for the device, which is almost essential in the minds of Americans for using services like AIM and web surfing.

The company was run by hardworking, versatile people who were action-orientated and willing to listen. Many of those early employees went on to fill important positions at the company later on. Some employees, however, had a hard time as the company grew, even though they had performed well when the company was smaller. At a fast-growing company, Dell notes, the job grows faster than the person.

However, because of this critical mistake, the company learned how to correctly manage their inventory, and according to Dell, became the best in the world at it. Later on, Dell also notes the company did not have the systems and processes to deal with rapid growth. This experience, however, proved to be another learning lesson for the company, as it installed a much better set of processes that helped further its growth.\n\nDell, Michael, 1965-, The Reasons Behind Dell, Inc.

Over a thirty-year period however, customers began to have an important role in the industry, but many companies were still being run by engineers working to promote complexity. With complicated products being sold, says Dell, customers had to rent specialized software and hire consultants from the computer companies to get their products to work. As a result, to the advantage of the computer companies, customers spent excessive amounts of money on personal computers; a model that Dell calls fundamentally flawed.\n\nDell, Michael, 1965-, Revolutionizing the PC and IT Industry 2007-05-01 1756\n\nRevolutionizing the PC and IT Industry\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nTo overcome the flawed model of the early PC industry (which benefited only PC companies, not consumers) Dell talks about how his company made the PC easy to use and less expensive. This approach is being used today to improve the IT industry. Dell, Inc. provides cost-effective IT services and products. In this manner, companies can spend less on maintaining their IT infrastructures and more on creating new capabilities. This allows for new business innovations, says Dell, which can stamp out the competition.\n\nDell, Michael, 1965-, Finding a Common Language for Improvement inside a Company 2007-05-01 1758\n\nFinding a Common Language for Improvement inside a Company\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp4)\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nDell explains how process is critical for organizing large numbers of people in a company, particular if it has grown rapidly.
