optimize trial costs and ROI provides ample market opportunity for clinical trial software vendors Convergence of software, data and analytical tools to optimize life sciences decision-making, especially through the use of Real World Evidence Pre-clinical vendors continue to capitalize on Standard for the Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) regulations through both software and outsourced services Clinical Trial Regulation EU No. 536/2014 will standardize clinical trials conducted in the European Union, but final implementation of appropriate technology infrastructure is in progress Large pharma is becoming receptive to platforms built on enterprise-level architecture (e.g. Salesforce) as they seek sophisticated solutions Sponsor-backed consolidators continue to primarily trade hands within the PE community, with early signs of electing to pursue strategic sales Virtual trials can solve critical pain points in the patient recruitment workflow, but the market has yet to generate a proven technology solution 1 2 3 4 Inside the Industry 5 6 In Case You Missed These Transactions Slide Anju Software recapitalized with Abry Partners 7 Clinical, medical affairs and

Attractive clinical software opportunity amidst growing pharma spend $43.0 $47.9 $47.4 $46.4 $50.7 $48.6 $49.6 $51.6 $53.3 $59.6 $65.5 $71.4 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 R&D Expenditures for PhRMA Members Only Source: PhRMA, Deloitte Measuring Return from Pharma Innovation Report • Pharma companies are increasing R&D spend amidst a need for innovative medicines, preference for personalized therapies and changes in payor behavior • Although research spend increased, R&D returns continue to decline amidst growing costs of bringing drugs to market • In the wake of decreasing trial returns, pharma organizations increasingly look to improve clinical trial efficiency and cut costs through robust clinical software products • By improving trial accuracy and automating repetitive tasks, researchers can spend time on more meaningful tasks within the clinical trial (e.g. interpretation of results) $ in billions eClinical Solutions Market $4.9 $13.7 2018

returns have fallen to the lowest level in nine years\n\n4. 4 Emerging Trends Key regulations could create significant industry tailwinds Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) • Enactment of SEND will create a standardized formatting for collecting and presenting nonclinical data • As organizations transition to the new reporting format, there is potential for significant technology and outsourced services spend in helping clients facilitate pre-clinical submissions • Most timeline milestones for the regulation have already passed, with one major milestone for IND studies left to be achieved in March 2020 Clinical Trial Regulation EU No. 536/2014 • The passage of Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014 created a consistent approach to how European Union Member States conduct clinical trials • Key benefits include (i) standardized electronic submission process, (ii) improved collaboration, information sharing and decision-making, (iii) increasing information transparency and (iv) higher safety standards for trial participants • The regulation was adopted in 2014, but timeline for implementation of a common EU portal and database to support trial monitoring is in progress Sources: Instem CY2017 Annual Report, Charles River, European Medicines Agency “Based on historic regulatory submission volumes, Instem anticipates that, to meet mandated FDA submission requirements, SEND related market expenditure will increase from approximately $10m in 2016 to around $130m in 2020.” – Instem CY2017 annual report SEND 3.0 and SEND 3.1 Mandatory Timelines December,

At first glance, it seems obvious that our financial results for 2018 were not up to our typical growth standards from the previous 10 years. That’s because we made a conscious decision to move away from perpetual licenses to a more predictable and reliable subscription license model, and that transition has had a significant short-term impact on both revenue and EBITDA. It generally takes one to two years to fully realize the benefits of this switch. Also, we invested heavily in research and product development in 2018, so that we could release three new product lines: a coding solution, a randomization and supply-tracking solution, and a comprehensive analytics platform. We believe those expenditures will be a good investment for our clients and the long-term growth of OmniComm.” Navigating a Revenue Model Transition CY2018 in Review(3) Enterprise Value (EV): $55.6 LTM Revenue: $27.1 LTM EBITDA: $3.4 EV / LTM Revenue: 2.05x EV / LTM EBITDA(1): 16.6x Net Debt (Cash): $8.2 Dry Powder(2): $22.3 Acquisitions: 5 Ownership Status: Public (PINX: OMCM) Headquarters: Fort Lauderdale, FL Description: Provider of EDC software and services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device organizations.
