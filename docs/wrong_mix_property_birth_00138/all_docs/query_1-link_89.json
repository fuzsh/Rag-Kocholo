        "text": "As U.N. secretary general from 1997 to 2006, Annan, a Ghanaian diplomat, led the organization amid violent upheavals including the wars following the collapse of Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda. In their wake, Annan pressed the United Nations to assert governments' \"responsibility to protect\" human lives and rights even amid conflict, and to be prepared to intervene against atrocities.\n\n“Annan’s tenure at the U.N. was marked by his quiet determination and moral conviction to solve international conflicts and build a more peaceful world,” said Ambassador George Moose, the vice chair of USIP’s Board of Directors. “From peace to poverty to human rights, his work at the U.N. helped revitalize the institution and reorient its work toward addressing the world’s most pressing modern challenges,” said Moose, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. He first worked with Annan in New York in the early 1990s and later served as a senior U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during Annan’s tenure.\n\n“Whether serving as the U.N.’s comptroller, or later as the head of the U.N. peacekeeping office, Annan’s focus was always on how to improve the organization’s ability to assist those who most needed its help. And he took personal responsibility in those instances where the U.N. fell short of that goal,” Moose added.\n\nContributions to Diplomacy\n\n\"Kofi Annan made important contributions to modern diplomacy,\" said Chester Crocker, who served as the U.S assistant secretary of state for Africa during the Reagan administration. \"As the first African secretary general, he mainstreamed his region of origin, working hard to make sure Africa got the attention it warranted from U.N. headquarters.\"\n\nCrocker, who served for 12 years as chairman of USIP's Board of Directors, praised Annan's role in strengthening the United Nations as an institution. U.N. secretaries general wield almost no real power, relying on persuasion and consensus-building among the United Nations' member states, and Annan became known for his quiet skills of personal diplomacy. \"He made his mark by standing up to U.N. Security Council permanent members when he thought it necessary, and was prepared to pay a price for following his instinct,\" said Crocker. \"He fought for major U.N. reform initiatives.\"\n\nAfter serving two terms as secretary general, Annan established his own foundation to improve governance in nations worldwide. And he continued to mediate in violent upheavals. When political violence erupted in Kenya over disputed elections, killing more than 1,000 people, Annan headed a mission that mediated a peace agreement and ended the violence. \"Students of mediation will long remember Kofi Annan for his effective tradecraft both in office and as a private citizen,\" said Crocker. \"The people of Kenya owe much to this statesman who played the central role in saving them from disastrous conflict 10 years ago.\" Most recently, Annan worked with the civilian government in Burma (Myanmar) to halt the violence against the Rohingya ethnic minority by the military, which the government does not control."
