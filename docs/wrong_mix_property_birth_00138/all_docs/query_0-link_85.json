        "text": "The University of Ghana says it is deeply saddened by the death of former United Nations (UN) Secretary-General and its immediate past Chancellor, Kofi Annan.\n\nA statement signed by Ms Stella A Amoa, Director of Public Affairs, said the Principal Officers – Mrs. Mary Chinery-Hesse, the Chancellor, Professor Yaw Twumasi, Chairman of the University Council and Prof Ebenezer Oduro Owusu, the Vice Chancellor, had all expressed shock at his death.\n\nMr Annan, the celebrated Ghanaian diplomat, died in the Swiss capital of Bern, in the early hours of Saturday at the age of 80.\n\nThe statement said “The University of Ghana and the world have indeed lost a distinguished leader who was incomparable in all respects.\n\nHe demonstrated true servant and selfless leadership, always wishing the best for his nation and the world. A true peace maker he was.”\n\nMr. Annan was Chancellor of the University from 2008 to July this year, when he ended his tenure.\n\nAt the recent investiture ceremony of his successor, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo described Mr. Kofi Annan as “one of Ghana’s most illustrious sons under whose stewardship the University attained the rank as one of the best universities in West Africa”.\n\nThe statement said “as Chancellor, Mr. Kofi Annan was instrumental in attracting numerous funding sources to the university especially in the areas of agricultural research and ICT development”.\n\n“The former Chancellor, will be remembered as a man of principle and gentle disposition.”\n\n“The University mourns with the family and shall cling to the memory of his life, his avowed passion for the University, and his legacy,” it added.
