        "text": "Mr Annan, 80, died in the early hours of Saturday in Switzerland after a short illness, according to a statement issued by his family.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Laureate was the seventh Secretary-General of the UN from January 1997 to December 2006, and became the first black African man to take on the top job as the world’s top diplomat.\n\nHe was founder and Chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, which issued a statement on social media, saying: “It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on Saturday 18th August after a short illness...”\n\n“His wife Nane and their children Ama, Kojo and Nina were by his side during his last days,” it said.\n\n“Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy. He selflessly placed others first, radiating genuine kindness, warmth and brilliance in all he did.”\n\nThe United Nations Migration Agency confirmed his death in a tweet, saying: “Today we mourn the loss of a great man, a leader, and a visionary: former @UN Secretary General @KofiAnnan. A life well lived. A life worth celebrating.”\n\nUnited Nations chief Antonio Guterres voiced deep sorrow at the news his predecessor had passed away, calling him “a guiding force for good”.\n\n“Kofi Annan was a guiding force for good,” Guterres said in a statement shortly after news broke of Annan’s passing.\n\n“In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,” he added.\n\nBusiness magnate Sir Richard Branson also tweeted that the world will be a “poorer place” without Annan.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says Annan “inspired me and many others with his ideas, his firm convictions and, not least, his charisma.”\n\nMs Merkel said in a statement that Annan shaped the United Nations “like hardly anyone before him” and said that “he knew how to spark enthusiasm, particularly among young people.”\n\nShe added that “in our present time, in which the common search for solutions to global problems is more urgent than ever, we will greatly miss Kofi Annan’s voice.”\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama said that Annan “embodied the mission of the United Nations like few others,” breaking barriers and rising through the ranks to become the first black African secretary-general in 1997.\n\nMr Obama added that Annan’s “sense of our common humanity always informed his outreach to the community of nations.”\n\nKofi Annan was a popular and unifying figure who quickly became a familiar face on television and in newspaper headlines. He was a sought-after guest at gala events and New York dinner parties.\n\nThe UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said he was grief-stricken over Annan’s death.\n\n“Kofi was humanity’s best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace. In a world now filled with leaders who are anything but that, our loss, the world’s loss becomes even more painful,” he said.\n\n“He was a friend to thousands and a leader of millions.”\n\nHis home country of Ghana has now declared a week of mourning after his death.\n\nDescribing Annan as a “consummate” diplomat, Ghana’s Presdient Akufo-Addo said in a statement that Ghana was “deeply saddened” by news of his death.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND CAREER\n\nMr Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938. He studied at the University of Science and Technology in Ghana and completed his undergraduate work in economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1961.\n\nFrom there he did his graduate studies at the Institute of International Affairs in Geneva, and in 1972 earned a Master of Science degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management.\n\nHe is fluent in English, French and a number of African languages. He went on to meet his wife, Nane, and they had three children Ama, Kojo and Nina.\n\nHe was the first Secretary-General to be appointed from within the organisation’s ranks. He first joined the UN in 1962 as an administrative and budget officer with the World Health Organisation in Geneva,\n\nHe later served with the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, the UN Emergency Force (UNEF II) in Ismailia, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva.\n\nBefore he went on to be Secretary-General, he was Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping. Mr. Annan also served as Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the former Yugoslavia (1995-1996), and facilitated the repatriation from Iraq of more than 900 international staff and other non-Iraqi nationals (1990).\n\nHIS UN ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nMr Annan pushed for reform to rebuild the United Nations and make it more effective.\n\nHe made sure that UN peacekeepers had more resources. In 2005, Member States established two new intergovernmental bodies: the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council.\n\nMr Annan also had a pivotal role in setting up the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the adoption of the UN’s first-ever counter-terrorism strategy, and the acceptance by Member States of the “responsibility to protect” people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nHis “Global Compact” initiative back in 1999, has become the world’s largest effort to promote corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn 1998, he helped to ease the transition to civilian rule in Nigeria. In that same year, he went to Iraq to try and solve a breakdown in talks with the Security Council in relation to weapons inspections to avoid further war and destruction.\n\nIn 1999, he was a key figure in helping Timor-Leste gain independence from Indonesia.\n\nHe was the diplomat behind certifying Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, and in 2006, his efforts helped bring peace between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nFormer US ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke once described Mr Annan as “an international rock star of diplomacy.”\n\nHIS AWARDS\n\nAnnan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with the UN in 2001 “for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world”.\n\nHe has also received numerous honorary degrees and many other national and international prizes, medals and honours.\n\nLIFE AFTER THE UN\n\nMr Annan’s role as an advocate for human rights did not stop. He helped negotiate an end to violence in Kenya that killed 1,220 people after the African nation’s December 2007 election. He also went on to work within the Kofi Annan Foundation as Chairman. He was also chair of The Elders, the group founded by Nelson Mandela.\n\nHe was a Chairman of the Africa Progress Panel and led the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.\n\nIn February 2012, he was tasked with bringing a resolution to the Syrian crisis after being appointed as joint UN and Arab League envoy.\n\nHe later resigned in August of that year.\n\nAt the time, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement saying: “Kofi Annan deserves our profound admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of assignments. He has worked within the mandate provided to him by the General Assembly and with the co-operation of various Member States.”\n\nHIS BRUSH WITH HOLLYWOOD\n\nMr Annan met many Hollywood stars who have pledged their support to global fights against war, poverty and other initiatives for change.\n\nU2 frontman Bono was photographed with Mr Annan when he gave a banner representing a petition signed by 21 million people to Nigeria’s president in 2000. Bono was delivering a message from 21 million people who had signed the petition to end global debt.\n\nLater, Mr Annan was seen with Bono and then-Live8 organiser Bob Geldof before a meeting at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland in 2005.\n\nMr Annan’s wife was also right by his side during his time at the UN, where she helped present Angelina Jolie with her United Nations Correspondents Association Citizen of the World award in 2003.\n\nAustralia’s own Nicole Kidman also met Mr Annan and his wife at the premiere of her movie in 2005, The Interpeter, which featured her taking on the role of an interpreter for the UN.\n\nMr Annan also filmed a scene with the Muppet character \"Elmo\" during a taping of Sesame Street in New York in 2001. At one point Annan offered Elmo a job at the UN and Elmo asked if he could win a Nobel prize, too.\n\nMr Annan's taping came a few days before he was to accept the 100th Nobel Peace Prize on December 10.\n\nFormer world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali also met Mr Annan while he was a United Nations Messenger of Peace. This 1998 file footage shows him receiving the dove of peace from Mr Annan.\n\nA ‘GLOBAL STATESMAN’ FOR ALL LEADERS\n\nThere wasn’t one leader that Mr Annan probably didn’t meet or at least brush shoulders with during his time at the UN.\n\nFrom US Presidents including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and even Australia’s former Prime Minister John Howard also met him during his long list of global meetings.\n\nFormer French President Jacques Chirac met with Mr Annan and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris where they attended a summit seeking to end violence in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip back in 2000.\n\nHe also had a private audience with former Pope John Paul II at The Vatican in 1997.\n\nHe also met Queen Elizabeth II several times. Here he can be seen at the annual Commonwealth Day service on Commonwealth Day on March 14, 2016 in Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nThe service is the largest annual inter-faith gathering in the UK.\n\nHIS VISIT TO AUSTRALIA\n\nIn February 2000, Mr Annan made his first trip to Australia, where he made a first stop to Darwin to thank the city for its role in bringing order and stability to East Timor.\n\nhe then went on to see Mr Howard in Canberra with former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. They discussed the UN leaving East Timor.\n\nMr Annan later met with Mr Howard at the UN in New York in 2003, where they talked about post-conflict Iraq and regional issues such as Timor-Leste and Bougainville.\n\nMr Howard told reporters he had indicated to Mr Annan it was necessary for all of the UN Member States to look forward in relation to the post-conflict period in Iraq.\n\nHe also said Australia saw that “great progress” was already being made in relation to that.\n\n“We want to see the affairs of Iraq handed back to the Iraqi people as soon as practicable,” Mr Howard said.\n\n“We want to see the emergence of a free and open government that is responsive to the wishes of the people of Iraq and I think all of the efforts of the world community should be directed towards that.”"
