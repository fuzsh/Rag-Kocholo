        "text": "Former UN Secretary-General, Nobel Peace Prize winner Kofi Annan died at the age of 80. As Secretary General, he conducted UN reform, devoted a lot of time to the fight against HIV and implemented the UN Global Compact. In 2001, he made a proposal to create the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nOn August 18, the 7th UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan passed away in Geneva at the age of 81 years. The reason for the death of the first black leader of the United Nations is not called, but we are talking about a \"short illness\".\n\nKofi Annan became Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1997 and led the organization until the end of 2006. In 2001, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAs Secretary-General of the United Nations, Annan is known for programs related to the fight against poverty and the spread of HIV, and as an opponent of the US invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Annan-led report, calling for an end to poverty and inequality, improving education and reducing the spread of HIV and AIDS, formed the basis of the Millennium Declaration adopted by the heads of state and government in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, Annan became the owner of the Nobel Peace Prize for \"breathing new life into the UN.\" In the same year, he proposed the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nAfter the resignation, the diplomat engaged in peacekeeping programs in Kenya and Syria, led his own fund and headed the organization \"Elders\", created by Nelson Mandela. Since 2016, Annan led an independent commission to investigate the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar."
