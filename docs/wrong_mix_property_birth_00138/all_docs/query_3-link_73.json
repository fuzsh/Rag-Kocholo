        "text": "By UN News\n\nNEW YORK (IDN) – In yet another move to honour the contribution of late Kofi Annan to the United Nations as Secretary-General from 1997 to 2005, who died at the age of 80 on August 18, UN News carried an article on September 20, saying that he “championed everything from stronger human rights and peacekeeping operations around the world, to revitalizing the UN itself by insisting on creating a new dynamic deputy chief role, an effective ethics office and the mantra of zero tolerance for sexual exploitation.”\n\nHis speechwriter Edward Motimer said: “The fact that people are still mourning Kofi Annan so strongly, indicates that there are many people in the world who realize that that’s what’s missing, and that that’s the kind of leadership that’s needed today.”\n\nFollowing is the text of the article:\n\nUnder his stewardship, leaders committed their countries to meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 – the precursor to today’s Sustainable Development Goals, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on the way.\n\nA UN agenda item since 1960, Timor-Leste became the first new country of the new millennium and the UN handed authority over to the democratically elected government there, ending the need to maintain a mission there.\n\nBut there were dark days as well, none more so during his time in office than the terrorist attack on the UN headquarters building in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, 15 years ago last month, that claimed 22 lives and, put an end to the assumption that serving under the UN flag would ensure safety.\n\nTribute to Kofi Annan (1938-2018)\n\nBut in addition to the many lives he touched throughout the world, former UN chief Kofi Annan had a profound impact on the staff of the Organization he led.\n\nHe was fun to work for as well as inspiring – Fred Eckhard, spokesperson\n\nUN Photo/Milton Grant: Secretary-General Kofi Annan (right) confers with his Fred Eckhard, his spokesperson, en route from Namibia to Angola, 22 March 1997.\n\nFred Eckhard, spokesperson for the late Secretary-General, recalled meeting Kofi Annan for the first time, long before his rise through the ranks to head the Organization.\n\nWith Pérez de Cuéllar at the helm and then-US President Ronald Reagan leading a strong conservative majority in Congress, intent on reducing contributions to the UN, Mr. Eckhard, himself an American, was hired by the UN Information Department. He was called in to brief the Budget Director, meeting Mr. Annan for the first time.\n\nLater, during “an explosion of peacekeeping” missions, Mr. Eckhard became the Spokesman for Namibia, and then for Yugoslavia. “Now I’ve got the new Director of Peacekeeping looking over my shoulder, and that’s Kofi Annan”, he said at that time.\n\nBack at Headquarters, after serving both those missions, journalists asked that Mr. Eckhard give the daily peacekeeping briefings, citing his “firsthand experience.”\n\nWith Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in charge, Mr. Eckhard became embedded in Kofi Annan’s department, which led to open access and a “very positive relationship.”\n\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, approaches a press stakeout at the UN Headquarters, in New York; at his left is Fred Eckhard, his spokesperson.

Which, in the UN, is unusual. It’s usually the other way around.”\n\nMr. Eckhard felt that his former boss endeared himself to many by the way he did business.\n\n“Other Secretaries-General tended to have this little insider circle of people of their own nationality,” he said. “Kofi had a broad circle of people he consulted, and he picked people whom he got to know, he thought were interesting – brought something to the table, as a part of his staff.\n\nAnd on a more personal note, the former spokesperson said the Mr. Annan was “secure, confident, serene, comfortable in his skin,” and when he talked “he didn’t just talk to you about work. He always asked about your spouse, about your kids, and very often remembered their names”.\n\n“He was fun to work for as well as inspiring,” Mr. Eckhard concluded.\n\nHe possessed a rock star quality – Edward Mortimer, speechwriter\n\nUN Photo/Stephenie Hollyman.

March 2003.\n\nEdward Mortimer served as former Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s speechwriter and communications director. He described Mr. Annan’s leadership style as “not sort of banging tables and shouting or beating your chest, but bringing people together, and saying we are all on this same planet together.”\n\n“We sink or swim together,” he asserted. “Be it climate change, be it mass epidemics, be it hunger, poverty, or be it very large-scale atrocities and violations of human rights.”\n\n“I think that is a lesson that the world still needs to learn, but the fact that people are still mourning Kofi Annan so strongly, indicates that there are many people in the world who realize that that’s what’s missing, and that that’s the kind of leadership that’s needed today.”\n\nMr. Mortimer believed that everyone who knew Kofi Annan and worked with him would say that he was an extraordinarily nice person to work for, he was very kind and considerate, and he knew how to get the best out of people.\n\n“I think that this sort of remarkable inner strength and calmness came partly from the very strong relationship he had with his wife, Nane, who travelled with him on many of his trips around the world,” Mr. Mortimer said, noting that her “smiling, cheerful presence at his side added something important to his leadership.”\n\nEdward Mortimer, head speechwriter for Secretary-General Kofi Annan, monitors a video being recorded by Mr. Annan for UN Day in 2004. UN Photo/Stephenie Hollyman\n\nThe former speechwriter, and senior journalist with the Financial Times, recalled that Mr. Annan had been recruited by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1962, and that up until the 1980s he had worked for different Geneva-based UN agencies, such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\n“That was where he met Nane,” Mr. Mortimer explained. “She was a lawyer, working for UNHCR.”\n\nThe former communications director did not find it surprising that at the end of his term as Secretary-General. they wanted to come back and live in Geneva. He also credited the late UN chief with bringing Switzerland into the UN fold.\n\n“I think it’s not a coincidence” that in 2002, during his time as Secretary-General “that the Swiss people voted to join the United Nations,” he argues.\n\n“It’s not something that comes easily to a country like Switzerland, which is very careful about its independence; very distrustful of super-national systems. But I think the fact that the UN was led at that time by Kofi Annan who was somebody who many of them knew and felt a rapport with, I’m sure made a difference,” elaborated Mr. Mortimer.\n\nIn his interview with UN News, he shared a charming episode about their life together, after his retirement. “He and Nane were living in Geneva, they’d find it difficult just to go for a walk in the street, because so often he was recognized and people would stop him and want his autograph and whatever,” said Mr. Mortimer.\n\nWith a marathon underway in the city, the couple thought it would be a good time to go out for a walk, thinking that nobody would be interested in them, but focused on the race instead.\n\n“One of the runners in the marathon came off the course and came up to him and asked for his autograph,” said Mr. Mortimer. “So perhaps that gives you an idea of that rock star quality that he had.” [IDN-InDepthNews – 23 September 2018]\n\nTop photo: UN Photo/Mark Garten – Kofi Annan, 8 April 1938 – 18 August 2018.\n\nIDN is flagship agency of the International Press Syndicate.\n\nfacebook.com/IDN.GoingDeeper – twitter.com/InDepthNews"
