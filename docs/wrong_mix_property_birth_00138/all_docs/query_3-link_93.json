        "text": "Annan was a scholarship scholar in the US at the age of 20, studying economics, before moving to Geneva where he attended graduate classes. He joined the staff of the World Health Organization based in the Swiss city and took UN posts in Africa and New York.\n\nThe statement further said, \"Kofi Annan was a global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world. During his distinguished career and leadership of the United Nations he was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights and the rule of law...Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy. He selflessly placed others first, radiating genuine kindness, warmth and brilliance in all he did. He will be greatly missed by so many around the world, as well as his staff at the Foundation and his many former colleagues in the United Nations system. He will remain in our hearts forever.\""
