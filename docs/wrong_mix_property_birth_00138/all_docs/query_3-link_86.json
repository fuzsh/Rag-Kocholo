        "text": "Former United Nations Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan has been described by world leaders as an Outstanding diplomat and a role model for many people in Africa.\n\nAnnan died on Saturday at the age of 80, after decades of championing efforts to try to end protracted conflicts in Africa, Asia and the middle East.\n\nWhere he was born\n\nGhanaian-born Kofi Annan, one of the world’s most eminent top diplomats, two-term Secretary General of the United Nations, and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize died in a hospital in the Swiss city of Bern.\n\nThe Kofi Annan Foundation announced his peaceful death with “immense sadness” after a short undisclosed illness.\n\nWhen he joined UN\n\nHe joined the UN in 1962, and rose to become its second African Secretary General from 1997 to 2006.\n\nAnnan reformed the UN bureaucracy and worked to combat HIV, especially in Africa. He also launched the UN Global Compact, encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies.\n\nTributes\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Annan championed the African cause.\n\nOnce known as a diplomatic ‘rock star’, Kofi Annan exuded dignity, compassion and modesty, and in 2001 was a co-recipient, with the UN of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe global body said his death was an “irreplaceable loss” for human rights.\n\nIn his time at the UN, Annan faced bad press. His opposition to the war in Iraq led to a sour relationship with United States conservatives.\n\nThere was also a U.N. oil-for-food scandal which he listed as one of his worst moments, in addition to not being able to stop the bloodshed in Sudan’s Darfur.\n\nAfter he retired from the UN, Kofi Annan went to live in a Swiss village in the Geneva countryside with his wife."
