        "text": "Malacañang mourned the passing of former United Nations Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan.\n\n\"We are saddened by the demise of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\" presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement sent to media on Sunday.\n\n\"Mr. Annan made history as the first and only black African to head the UN, and his humanitarian work has been recognized and earned the former world’s top diplomat a Nobel Peace Prize,\" he added.\n\n\"The world, has, indeed, lost not only a diplomat and peacekeeper but a humanitarian who worked tirelessly for a better and more informed humanity,\" Roque said.\n\n\"It was Mr. Annan who said, 'Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family,'\" he added.\n\nIn a separate statement, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said, \"The Philippines will remember Kofi Annan for his unwavering commitment to multilateralism that reinvigorated the United Nations and brought peace to places around the world that have been torn apart by conflict.\"\n\nAnnan died Saturday in Bern, Switzerland at the age of 80.\n\nA Ghanaian national, he retired in Geneva after serving two terms as UN secretary general."
