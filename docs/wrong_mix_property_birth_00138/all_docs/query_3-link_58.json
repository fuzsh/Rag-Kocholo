        "text": "Kofi Annan, a charismatic symbol of the United Nations who rose through its ranks to become the first black African secretary-general, and later a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, has died, his foundation confirmed on Twitter. He was 80 years old. His wife Nane and their three children Ama, Kojo, and Nina were with him.\n\n“Kofi Annan was a global statesman and a deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world,” the statement from his foundation read. “He was an ardent champion of peace, sustainable development, human rights, and the rule of law.”\n\nAfter stepping down from his role at the United Nations after two successive five-year terms, Annan remained very much engaged in world events, chairing Nelson Mandela’s group, The Elders, succeeding Desmond Tutu. His foundation promoted causes like fair, peaceful elections, and battling violent extremism, a cause he began by enlisting young people to help (“You are never too young to lead, and we are never too old to learn,” Annan told a Global Citizen audience in 2018). A son of Ghana, he felt a special responsibility towards Africa throughout his life and career: Towards the end of his life he remained a chair of the Africa Progress Panel, and an early leader of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.\n\nAnnan remained a vocal commentator on world events, promoting good governance and a more interconnected world. He was also champion of women’s rights, famously saying that “there is no tool for development more effective than empowerment of women.” Annan was a “ ‘purposeful optimist’ who spoke for the voiceless, a diplomat who worked for peace in a tumultuous world, and a leader who dedicated his life to advocating for the liberty and freedom of all mankind,” Bukola Saraki, senate president and chairman of the eighth National Assembly of Nigeria wrote on Twitter, “We will miss him.”\n\n“Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his compassion and empathy,” the statement from his foundation read. “He selflessly placed others first, radiating genuine kindness, warmth, and brilliance in all he did.”"
