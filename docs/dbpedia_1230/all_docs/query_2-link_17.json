        "text": "Spatially explicit capture–recapture analyses\n\nWe developed estimates of Sunda clouded leopard population density using a spatially explicit capture–recapture approach (Efford, Reference Efford2004; Royle & Young, Reference Royle and Young2008), undertaken within a Bayesian framework (Royle et al., Reference Royle, Karanth, Gopalaswamy and Kumar2009). We used the package SPACECAP v. 1.1.0 (Gopalaswamy et al., Reference Gopalaswamy, Royle, Hines, Singh, Jathanna, Kumar and Karanth2012) in R v. 3.1.2 (R Development Core Team, 2014) to conduct all spatially explicit capture–recapture analyses. We used pelage markings and morphology to identify and sex individual animals and developed a unique capture history for each individual. Detections of cubs were recorded but only adults were included in the analysis. Although it has been shown that gender can affect detection parameters in felids, and inclusion of sex as a covariate can consequently improve parameter estimation precision (e.g. Sollmann et al., Reference Sollmann, Furtado, Gardner, Hofer, Jácomo, Tôrres and Silveira2011), we were unable to model sex-specific detection parameters because of the low number of female recaptures, and therefore data for both sexes were pooled and analysed together. We assigned each 24-hour period as a unique sampling occasion, as short sampling intervals may improve model precision (Goldberg et al., Reference Goldberg, Tempa, Norbu, Hebblewhite, Mills, Wangchuk and Lukacs2015). We limited our sampling duration to 90 days, apart from at one site (Tabin), where the lengthy transition period, and consequent reduction in camera-trapping effort, necessitated a period of 120 days to provide sufficient detection frequencies. Such sampling durations are in line with similar studies to approximate population closure (e.g. Royle et al., Reference Royle, Magoun, Gardner, Valkenburg and Lowell2011; Wilting et al., Reference Wilting, Mohamed, Ambu, Lagan, Mannan, Hofer and Sollmann2012).\n\nWe developed a state space, a polygon defined by the addition of a buffer to the outermost coordinates of each trapping grid, within which we established potential home range centres by delineating a grid of regularly spaced points, with a mesh size of 0.25 km2. Following Gopalaswamy et al. (Reference Gopalaswamy, Royle, Hines, Singh, Jathanna, Kumar and Karanth2012) we eliminated potential home-range centres from areas predicted to be unsuitable for Sunda clouded leopards, using ArcMap 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, USA) in conjunction with habitat data derived from field knowledge and high-resolution aerial images from Google Earth (Google Inc., Mountain View, USA). We assumed that Sunda clouded leopards are restricted to forest cover and do not occur in oil palm plantations (Hearn et al., Reference Hearn, Ross, Macdonald, Bolongon, Cheyne and Mohamed2016b), and therefore we considered forested areas (both pristine and disturbed) as habitat, and all other non-forest land uses as unsuitable. During a sequence of preliminary runs we systematically increased buffer size until the probability of detection at the state space boundary was negligible. Accordingly, buffer size was 12–30 km.\n\nWe ran all SPACECAP density estimation analyses using a half normal detection and Bernoulli's encounter model, with 100,000 Markov-Chain Monte Carlo iterations and a thinning rate of 1. We varied burn-in for each survey until adequate parameter convergence was attained, which we assessed by means of Geweke tests; z scores between –1.64 and 1.64 were deemed acceptable. SPACECAP applies a data augmentation process in which a theoretical population of zero-encounter-history individuals is added to the dataset of known individuals (Gopalaswamy et al., Reference Gopalaswamy, Royle, Hines, Singh, Jathanna, Kumar and Karanth2012). We varied data augmentation values for each survey, assigning a final value following a series of preliminary runs, increasing data augmentation where necessary to ensure that ψ, the ratio of the estimated abundance within the state space to the maximum allowable number defined by the augmented value, did not exceed 0.8. We examined the Bayesian P-value provided by SPACECAP, which measures the discrepancy between observed data and expected values, to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model; models presenting P-values of c. 0 or 1 were considered to be inadequate (Gelman et al., Reference Gelman, Meng and Stern1996; Gopalaswamy et al., Reference Gopalaswamy, Royle, Hines, Singh, Jathanna, Kumar and Karanth2012). For each parameter estimated, we present the posterior mean, standard deviation and 95% Bayesian highest posterior density interval. The highest posterior density interval is the shortest interval enclosing 95% of the posterior distribution. Following Sollmann et al. (Reference Sollmann, Linkie, Haidir and Macdonald2014) we consider parameters from each site to be significantly different if the 95% highest posterior density interval of one does not include the mean of the other.\n\nInfluence of anthropogenic disturbance on Sunda clouded leopard density\n\nWe present estimates of Sunda clouded leopard population density from six of eight forest areas we surveyed in Sabah, Borneo, including the first for this species from enrichment-planted, highly fragmented, and submontane forest types. Our density estimates from forest areas exposed to varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance are 1.39–3.10 individuals per 100 km2, and are thus comparable with those from previous studies in Sabah (0.84–1.9; Brodie & Giordano, Reference Brodie and Giordano2012; Wilting et al., Reference Wilting, Mohamed, Ambu, Lagan, Mannan, Hofer and Sollmann2012), the Indonesian province of Central Kalimantan (0.72–4.41; Cheyne et al., Reference Cheyne, Stark, Limin and Macdonald2013), and Sumatra (0.8–1.6; Sollmann et al., Reference Sollmann, Linkie, Haidir and Macdonald2014). Nevertheless, statistically significant differences in Sunda clouded leopard population density were evident between several of our study areas.\n\nAlthough the absence of replication in our study approach limits our ability to draw robust conclusions about the possible influence of anthropogenic disturbance on Sunda clouded leopard densities, our results support our first a-priori hypothesis that population density is negatively impacted by poaching pressure. The two areas with the lowest estimates, the primary uplands of the Crocker Range Park and the low-lying logged forests of the Lower Kinabatangan, were subject to some of the highest levels of poaching pressure, whereas forest areas with a relatively low incidence of poaching (e.g. Danum Valley, Ulu Segama and Tawau) yielded some of the highest densities. In the case of Ulu Segama, the estimate of density was statistically higher than that of the two lowest density sites. The comparatively low density found in Crocker Range may also be a reflection of higher-elevation forest supporting lower productivity. Although we are unable to disentangle the possible influence of low detection probabilities as a result of other factors unrelated to abundance (Sollmann et al., Reference Sollmann, Mohamed, Samejima and Wilting2013), the low photographic capture success from Malua Forest Reserve, where poaching intensity was highest among our study areas, is indicative of a low population density relative to our other sites. The high density estimate from Tabin Wildlife Reserve, which was also significantly higher than that of our two lowest density sites, despite the site being subject to moderate levels of poaching, appears to contradict this trend. However, unlike other areas where poaching activity was more diffuse, most records of poaching activity in Tabin typically involved poachers spot-lighting from four-wheel-drive vehicles along the single access road within the Reserve, or occasionally along the western border with an oil palm plantation. It is therefore possible that the impact of poaching was not widespread throughout the study area.\n\nOur data also tentatively support our second a-priori hypothesis, that Sunda clouded leopard population density is lower in forests with higher levels of forest fragmentation. Firstly, the Lower Kinabatangan, which is composed of several relatively small forest patches embedded within a largely oil palm plantation landscape, supported the second lowest density of all our study areas. Secondly, we found no evidence of Sunda clouded leopards within the Kabili–Sepilok Forest Reserve, a small (42.76 km2), potentially isolated dipterocarp forest fragment contiguous with a coastal chain of mangrove and nipah palm but otherwise surrounded by oil palm plantations. Forestry Department staff stationed in the area reported that the species had been recorded there in the past, so it is likely that gradual loss of surrounding forest and conversion to oil palm plantations has led to local extirpation. Kabili–Sepilok Forest Reserve is a probable harbinger of the effects of ongoing fragmentation, which will be detrimental to Sunda clouded leopard populations across much of the species’ remaining range.\n\nThe low number of photographic captures from Malua Forest Reserve, which was surveyed just 1 year after selective logging operations ceased, provides tentative support for our third a-priori hypothesis, that time since logging is positively related to Sunda clouded leopard density in selectively logged forests. Furthermore, our two highest density estimates were from two forests surveyed 16 and 20 years post logging activities, of which one, the enrichment-planted Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, had a statistically higher density than the primary Danum Valley Conservation Area. The survey of the Tangkulap–Pinangah Forest Reserve in Sabah by Wilting et al. (Reference Wilting, Mohamed, Ambu, Lagan, Mannan, Hofer and Sollmann2012), just 8 years after logging operations stopped, yielded a density of 0.84 individuals per 100 km2, which is lower than any of our estimates, and Brodie et al. (Reference Brodie, Giordano, Zipkin, Bernard, Mohd-Azlan and Ambu2015b) showed that, compared to unlogged forest areas, the abundance of four ungulate species was lower in recently logged areas, whereas bearded pigs and sambar deer were more abundant, and muntjac and mousedeer less abundant in old logged areas. Thus, although we cannot be sure by what mechanism the effect may operate, one hypothesis is that following recent logging there is a direct negative effect on prey abundance and/or availability, which declines over time. Another, not mutually exclusive, hypothesis is that logging operations, and the associated proliferation of roads, increase both the number of poachers and their penetration of the forest, reducing prey populations and perhaps also inflicting a bycatch on Sunda clouded leopards themselves, and that the relative impact of these roads diminishes over time as the roads become unnavigable. Brodie et al. (Reference Brodie, Giordano, Dickson, Hebblewhite, Bernard and Mohd-Azlan2015a) found that an increase in road density in Borneo was associated with reduced local occurrence of Sunda clouded leopards, and in Sumatra, Haidir et al. (Reference Haidir, Dinata, Linkie and Macdonald2013) found that this felid's habitat use was positively affected by distance to forest edge. In another Sumatran study, McCarthy et al. (Reference McCarthy, Wibisono, McCarthy, Fuller and Andayani2015) reported that this species occurred most commonly at moderate distances from roads, rivers and forest edges, all features that facilitate the movement of people.\n\nOur results confirm earlier suggestions (e.g. Wilting et al., Reference Wilting, Fischer, Bakar and Linsenmair2006; Hearn et al., Reference Hearn, Ross, Brodie, Cheyne, Haidir and Loken2016a,Reference Hearn, Ross, Macdonald, Bolongon, Cheyne and Mohamedb) that selectively logged forest provides an important resource for Sunda clouded leopards, and suggest that appropriate management of these commercial forests could further enhance their conservation value. Our results suggest that the overriding priority is to reduce poaching pressure, both on these felids and their prey, by reducing access to the forest interior along logging roads. Reduction of vehicular access could be achieved through the installation of gates and the destruction of bridges following the cessation of logging activities. This is particularly important in more recently logged forests, which will have a more extensive network of gravel roads that are still passable. Such efforts will not prevent access on foot, and so measures such as anti-poaching patrols, although expensive, are also essential to reduce the threat from poaching in these forests.\n\nEstimation of population size in Sabah\n\nWe provide the first estimate of Sunda clouded leopard population size for the Malaysian state of Sabah based on robust spatially explicit capture–recapture density estimates from nine forest areas within the state. Our estimated population size of c. 754 individuals (95% posterior interval 327–1,337) is a significant methodological improvement on the approximate estimate of 1,500–3,200 individuals provided by Wilting et al. (Reference Wilting, Fischer, Bakar and Linsenmair2006), based on extrapolation of a track-based assessment of density from Tabin Wildlife Reserve. Our basic model of population size does not include a minimum patch size or measure of proximity to other patches in its calculation, as such data are currently lacking. Nevertheless, the apparent absence of the species from the relatively small forest fragment of Kabili–Sepilok suggests that our estimate of available habitat may be slightly inflated, and with it our population estimate. In addition, although we made efforts to survey a range of forest types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance, there are a number of forest types that were not included. Of these, mangrove forest, given its potential role in connecting otherwise isolated populations, is particularly important. Surveys within these habitats, and efforts to determine minimum patch sizes for this felid, are therefore a priority.\n\nAs forest cover on Borneo declines, there is an increasing need to assess the population size of the Sunda clouded leopard across the entire island, and thus the conservation status of the Bornean subspecies, Neofelis diardi ssp. borneensis (Hearn et al., Reference Hearn, Sanderson, Ross, Wilting and Sunarto2008). The Sabah bias of our data, and the lack of robust spatially explicit density estimates from outside this region, currently hinders such assessment. Although the overall nature of the forests within Sabah broadly reflects those of the island as a whole, outside this state there are stark differences in forest management and patterns of deforestation (Cushman et al., Reference Cushman, Macdonald, Landguth, Malhi and Macdonald2017). Furthermore, the threat from hunting and/or poaching, which we have shown to be a potentially important factor influencing Sunda clouded leopard density, is likely to vary considerably throughout the island. There is increasing evidence that Sabah's forests have hitherto been subjected to lower influences of hunting and poaching than elsewhere and that population densities may be significantly lower outside this region. The mean encounter rates of hunters/poachers in five areas in Sarawak were more than an order of magnitude higher than that described here (Brodie et al., Reference Brodie, Giordano, Zipkin, Bernard, Mohd-Azlan and Ambu2015b). Furthermore, Cheyne et al. (Reference Cheyne, Sastramidjaja, Muhalir, Rayadin and Macdonald2016) surveyed eight forest areas in Kalimantan with a comparable effort and approach to that used in our study, and recorded an exceptionally low number of Sunda clouded leopards (≤ 3) from six of these forests, which could be indicative of low population densities. Efforts should thus be made both to establish the incidence of poaching across this felid's range, and to derive robust, spatially explicit estimates of its density outside Sabah to inform the conservation of this elusive wild cat."
