He used a Sony a7RII with a macro lens to capture the remarkable photo.\n\nHyllus diardi, which are known as one of the world's premier jumping spiders, generally reside in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, China and Indonesia.\n\nFemales are usually larger than their male counterparts and they usually have gray or white hairs, with black eyes, according to Spider Identifications."
