I've read about 8-10 months for jumping spiders but since this one is the biggest jumping spider, does it live any longer? Do they sell them as baby, or egg, or adult?\n\nEDIT : To be more accurate, I'm looking for the jumping spider that has the longest life expectancy and the biggest size possible though I'm also interested if some other jumping spiders species are more intelligent/curious than others as well.\n\nI have some Phidippus otiosus females that are onto heir second year adult, I'm not sure how long Hyllus life expenctency is, but it I've had them for more than 6 months, and no signs of slowing down yet.\n\nH. giganteus is way leggier, so it has a greater leg span, a slightly longer and way more slender body than H. diardi. Comparing mine side by side there is definitely a visible size difference.\n\nI have some Phidippus otiosus females that are onto heir second year adult, I'm not sure how long Hyllus life expenctency is, but it I've had them for more than 6 months, and no signs of slowing down yet.\n\nH. giganteus is way leggier, so it has a greater leg span, a slightly longer and way more slender body than H. diardi.

Is there a difference in behaviour aside from their jump length?\n\nI live in EU, I have seen an online shop they sell the Hyllus for 60€, is it a good price ? Any recommandation on where I should get them?\n\nI’m not familiar of European seller.\n\nI haven’t kept too many of them, so I can’t comment anything conclusive on their behaviour, but my Hyllus diardi can be a bit more skittish.\n\nThanks for the info.\n\nStill looking for a Hyllus so far not much luck. The only website I found shipping here is chinese and I am reluctant to buy from them as they have a few bad reviews saying they are doing illegal imports and putting endangered species on the market on top of not caring about the animals so I don't want to support them. Plus that would be a long trip for the spider, not a fan of stressing it too much.\n\nTurned out the ones I found for 60€ were out of stock so I am still looking to find one for now.\n\nHello there Ben Lee, your hyllus giganteus doesn't seem it was although your hyllus diardi looks like it's the normal hyllus diardi. Did you bought them or you catch them? Bc many spider traders has mistaken hyllus giganteus look... Some of the seller sells \"hyllus giganteus\" with that 2 stripes on their cephalothorax and face like yours is actually the other hyllus species but i forgotten what is it called. It doesn't matter whether your if your hyllus giganteus is a sub adult or what, but the hyllus giganteus doesn't have that kind of appearance... I checked the record but I still can't find any difference although it looks different\n\nNow and then people on here would post about where they can acquire a Hyllus giganteus.\n\nThey are quite hard to track down in the past; but luckily with the rise of the jumping spider hobby, I've been able to get both H. giganteus and H. diardi sub adult pair.\n\nI have a huge suspicion that many of the \"H. giganteus\" offered in the past may have just H. diardi that are mislabeled, which is fair due to lack of images & info about them; so I feel like now is a good time where I solve this confusion once and for all.\n\nView attachment 335705\n\nAbove: Hyllus giganteus female (sub-adult); She has 2 very well defined stripes on her \"face\", and a black marking on the head (this is one of the more key characteristics)\n\nBelow : Hyllus diardi female (sub-adult); She has 1 more well defined stripe on her \"face\", but sometimes you can additional 1-2 pairs of faint stripes, more importantly is the the black marking on the head, it has little markings that reach down towards the eyes.\n\nView attachment 335706\n\nView attachment 335707\n\nAbove:Hyllus giganteus male (sub-adult): Very different chelicerae shape, they wedge apart, and are longer (gets eve more impressive in size once it reaches maturity)\n\nBelow : Hyllus diardi male (sub-adult): Parallel, like how most other true spiders have thier chlicera oriented\n\nView attachment 335708\n\nAlso include the dorsal view of the males:\n\nView attachment 335710\n\nAbove: Hyllus giganteus male (sub-adult): 2 white lines running along the sides\n\nBelow : Hyllus diardi male (sub-adult): 6 spotted; 2 rows of 2 white spots on either side & 2 white spots the middle.\n\nView attachment 335711\n\nHope this helps, if my explanations are a bit confusing or I made any errors please point them out to me~\n\nAlso I'll eventually upload their adult pictures when they mature with some scale bare to tell their size.\n\nAaah when I found this Hyllus Diardi male i thought it was a Hyllus Semicupreus, since it was quite small too.
