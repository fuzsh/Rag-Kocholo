        "text": "Corbett (1946) wrote that \"Those who have never seen a leopard under favorable conditions in his natural surroundings can have no conception of the grace of movement, and beauty of coloring, of this the most graceful and the most beautiful of all animals in our Indian jungles. Nor are his attractions limited to outward appearances for, pound for pound, his strength is second to none, and in courage he lacks nothing.\"\n\nAs to man-eating, Corbett thought that, in addition to disabilities that hinder capture of normal prey, leopards acquire a taste for human flesh when scavenging on corpses thrown into the jungle during an epidemic. He wrote: \"A leopard, in an area in which his natural food is scarce, finding these bodies very soon acquires a taste for human flesh, and when the disease dies down and normal conditions are established, he very naturally, on finding his food supply cut off, takes to killing human beings.\" Of the two man-eating leopards of Kumaon, which between them killed 525 people, the \" 'Panar Leopard' followed on the heels of a very severe outbreak of cholera, while the 'Rudraprayag Leopard' followed the mysterious disease which swept through India in 1918 and was named 'war fever' \"[i.e., the influenza pandemic]. Corbett tracked and shot them both.\n\nThis young Leopard (right) is simply yawning, both does show a nice set of canines. Although Leopards do not typically dominate one's nightmares —as Lions or Tigers may do — they can be very dangerous. When visiting Kruger NP, South Africa, 1996, we were told that a guard — sleeping in a guardhouse at one of the designated camps — had been killed just that year by a Leopard leaping through an open window and attacking him. Big game hunter Kenneth Anderson described man-eating Leopards as bolder and far more threatening than tigers, but also more difficult to track: \"Because of his smaller size he can conceal himself in places impossible to a tiger, his need for water is far less, and in veritable demoniac cunning and daring, coupled with the uncanny sense of self preservation and stealthy disappearance when danger threatens, he has no equal.\" Famed African naturalist Jean-Pierre Hallet fought and killed a Leopard that launched an unprovoked attack on a friend during a walk in the forest. Hallet used only his knife and the stump of his arm to subdue the cat [he had lost a hand while dynamiting fish to feed villagers during a famine; see Congo Kitabu (1965)].\n\nSeeing a Leopard in the wild is quite difficult in Asia (I've not seen one there), but is more regular in the open savanna of some African parks, including Mara, Serengeti, and Tarangire in east Africa. The latter park — with a wider variety of habitats and not dominated by Lions (as are the Mara and Serengeti, for example) — provided us much success during a brief few days, in which we saw a Leopard or two almost every day in the dry season."
