        "text": "A mega thanks to Precarious for telling me these spiders exist.\n\nI'm ecstatic to have found one of these beauties in the wild. I wasn't even looking for one, but the moment I spotted her, the species was unmistakable. These are truly amazing creatures to behold; I've never seen a jumping spider so large before. And they move like miniature animatronics haha! I can't get over it.\n\nHer name is Fleur. She has 7 legs and beautiful eyelashes.\n\nI dooon't know how old she is, but I don't suspect she has another molt left to go through...let alone enough molts to grow her missing leg back. But that's ok. She's still spry, with an excellent appetite. I wonder how she lost her leg, to begin with...\n\nI don't have a proper measurement for her, but she fits perfectly inside a canadian 1$ coin (or, alternatively, she fits relatively well inside a thai 1B coin).\n\nHere's a shabby phone-cam photo of her chillin on my finger:"
