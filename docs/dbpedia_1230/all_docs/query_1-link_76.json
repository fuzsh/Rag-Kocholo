        "text": "The Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi) also known as Diard's fireback, is a fairly large, approximately 80 cm long, pheasant. The male has a grey plumage with an extensive facial caruncle, crimson legs and feet, ornamental black crest feathers, reddish brown iris and long curved blackish tail. The female is a brown bird with blackish wing and tail feathers.\n\nThe Siamese fireback is distributed to the lowland and evergreen forests of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia. This species is also designated as the national bird of Thailand. The female usually lays between four and eight rosy eggs.\n\nThe scientific name commemorates the French naturalist Pierre-Médard Diard.\n\nStatus\n\nDue to habitat loss and over-hunting in some areas, the Siamese fireback was evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, however, it is now Least Concern."
