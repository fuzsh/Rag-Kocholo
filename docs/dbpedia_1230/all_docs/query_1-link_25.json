        "text": "The Bornean Clouded Leopard is a medium-sized wild cat (belongs to the group of small felines though) found on Borneo, Sumatra and the Batu Islands in the Malay Archipelago and publicised under that name by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on March 14, 2007. The species was previously found in Java, but has not been recorded there since Neolithic times.\n\nThe coat of the Bornean Clouded Leopard is marked with irregularly shaped, dark-edged ovals which are said to be shaped like clouds, hence its common name.\n\nBecause the Bornean Clouded Leopard’s habits make it difficult to study, exact figures of its population do not exist. However, recent studies and filming (Dr Robert Martin) estimate the population to be between 5,000 and 11,000 great cats left on Borneo, and 3,000 to 7,000 on Sumatra. In the countries of its native range, hunting of the Clouded Leopard is prohibited. However, these bans are very poorly enforced.\n\nEncroachment upon and complete destruction of the Bornean Clouded Leopards’ natural habitat, primarily by logging and the creation of rubber and palm oil plantations, continues to threaten the whole fauna of Borneo."
