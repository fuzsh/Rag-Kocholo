        "text": "Due to new DNA evidence, the cat family tree has changed considerably over the last decade. Many of the cats have new scientific names, some new species have been declared, and some species have been reclassified as subspecies. Genetic research has revealed some very interesting things but the results are not set in stone. These classifications show how the cat species are related to each other - as far as we know right now. Some information (especially the subspecies classification) is heavily disputed and likely to change over time.\n\nThere are currently 36 cat species."
