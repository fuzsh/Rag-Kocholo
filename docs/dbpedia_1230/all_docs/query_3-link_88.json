Averages paler and with darker red on the facial skin than similar Chestnut-bellied Malkoha and lacks its dark chestnut belly. Green-billed Malkoha paler gray and has bright white lines around the facial patch. Inhabits lowland and foothill forests and forest edges, where it clambers about rather clumsily in trees and dense tangles. Gives a rather hollow, clipped-off hoot, as well as a bright, rising call.",
