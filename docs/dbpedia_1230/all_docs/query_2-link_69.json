        "text": "Determining populations of leopards (Panthera pardus) is important for both their conservation and also that of their prey. Camera-trapping has emerged as a powerful and non-invasive tool for studying carnivores in their natural habitats especially for species that are elusive or occur at low densities such as leopards. This thesis presents the Baited-Camera Trapping (BCT) method of censusing leopards, a Zimbabwean conceived design modification of the conventional unbaited setup. This method has been documented to improve capture rates and provide robust and novel data for leopard surveys in savanna environments. This study used single cameras coupled with bait to survey a population of leopards at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve (MWR), a privately owned medium-sized property in south-eastern Zimbabwe. The objectives of the study were to: (1) conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal density and exposure length of baits for censusing leopards at MWR, (2) develop a technique for estimating body dimensions of leopards from camera trap photographs, (3) determine the influence of competing carnivores on the feeding habits of leopards in a savanna ecosystem, and (4) to review the application of the BCT method in comparison with conventional camera trapping. Data were collected from July 2017 to January 2018 and the CAPTURE software was used for population size analysis and the Statistical Package for Social Scientists were used for cost-benefit analyses. Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modelling, performed using the R statistical software, was used to compare actual and photograph based body measurement data as well as to analyze the influence of competing predators on feeding duration and resting distances of leopards at bait stations. This study estimated the leopard population at MWR at 61 (61-67) individuals and concludes that using BCT stations at a density of 0.24 cameras km-2 km for 9 days is the optimal and cost-effective sampling effort required to provide reliable population statics in semi-arid savannas. The study established that the type of body measurement and the posture of a leopard in a photograph had a significant influence on the accuracy of image-based measurements. Body length measurements taken from the level back-straight forelimb-parallel tail posture were the most accurate [mean error = 2.0 cm (1.5-2.7 cm)] while head-to-tail and tail length measurements and variations from the level back-straight forelimb-parallel tail posture did not provide sufficient accuracy. The findings also showed that the presence of male leopards at feeding locations was associated with shorter feeding durations while lion presence caused feeding leopards to wait longer from bait sites. The thesis provides the first published record of the BCT method outlining a step-by-step procedure for replication by other researchers and a comparative review of the method with traditional survey approaches. The findings in this thesis underscore the ability of BCT method to investigate multiple leopard population ecology questions which enhances its cost-benefit ratio. Furthermore, the method provides new information which can broaden the scope of research and inform management and policy direction. It is recommended that (i) researchers and managers incorporate cost-benefit analysis in their work as this is essential for informing effective application of effort and resources, (ii) researchers take advantage of the BCT method to collect behaviour and morphological data for species that are less understood such as leopards to maximize on the capital investment, (iii) managed wildlife areas that contain leopards consider the uptake of the BCT techniques as a wide encompassing population monitoring option, and (iv) regulatory authorities that supervise hunting operations such as the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority adopt the BCT technique to enhance their information management portfolios and quota setting for sustainable harvest practises.\n\nThe use of baits at camera trap stations has been shown to increase capture rates in population surveys of large carnivores. This study set out to establish the most cost-effective density and duration of sampling for baited-camera trapping (BCT) of leopards in a semi-arid savanna environment. To determine this, we used batches of 30 BCT stations (sampling occasions) to survey a population of leopards (Panthera pardus) at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in southeastern Zimbabwe from July to October 2017. We applied combinations of low to high sampling densities (2e7 occasions) and short to long sampling durations (2e14 days) and observed the effects on population estimates and cost of conducting the survey. Sixty-one leopards were identified from 4596 photographs collected over 2940 camera days. At the highest level of sampling (7 occasions and 14 days), 50 out of the 61 recorded individuals were captured more than twice indicating a near-complete survey, so the population estimate at this level (61; 95% CI ¼ 61e67) was used as a benchmark to gauge accuracy of estimates from lower levels of effort. Accuracy and precision of population estimates stabilized over a range of efforts with 4 occasions and 9 days being the most cost-effective and sampling beyond this point incurring increased costs but negligible benefits. A minimum cost of US$47 km À2 was required to obtain a reliable estimate with running costs responding more to changes in sampling density than sampling duration. We concluded that using BCT stations at a density of 0.24 cameras km À2 for 9 days is optimal for censusing leopards in semi-arid savannas. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis may help researchers allocate resources and time within budget and technical constraints, ensuring that effort is not expended beyond what is economically or ecologically necessary.\n\nAcross Asia protected areas serve as refuges for carnivores inside human-dominated landscapes. However , the creation of hard edges around reserve boundaries where conflicts with humans arise and disturbance from human activities inside the reserves may affect carnivore behaviour and ecology. Thailand's largest protected area, Kaeng Krachan National Park (2915 km 2) receives >100,000 visitors annually while maintaining an intact assemblage of prey species for large carnivores, making it a potentially important site for population recovery of leopards (Panthera pardus), tigers (Panthera tigris) and dholes (Cuon alpinus). We assessed the abundance of leopards and their prey base, and their response to changes in levels of human activity after an unexpected flooding event that resulted in the park being closed to visitors for >6 months. Using camera-traps, we identified 6 individual leopards and used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods, incorporating humans and prey as covariates, to test for factors affecting the detection probability of leopards before and after the park closure. Leopard density was unchanged between the two periods, however the movement and activity patterns were clearly different. In the absence of tourist activity, leopards tended to move more frequently, leopard detection rates increased by 70% and activity shifted towards being more diurnal. The consequences of these changes in behaviour may include improved health, reproduction and survival. A management strategy involving seasonal closure of parks may serve to alleviate pressure on leopards and other carnivores. We recommend using information on abundance of large carnivores and their prey species, and human disturbance as the key indicators for long-term monitoring and management of protected areas in Southeast Asia."
