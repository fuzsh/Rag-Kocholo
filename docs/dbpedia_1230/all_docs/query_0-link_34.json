        "text": "Taken inside the forest on a very rainy day.\n\nIt is an endemic species of Vietnam, found only in a small area in central Vietnam.\n\nIt is classified as Vulnerable\n\nSpecies # 1077\n\nMang Den - Vietnam\n\nHello, dear friends. I wish you all a Merry Christmas!\n\nThank you so much for all your lovely messages and good wishes. I've been absent on vacation but, hopefully, I'll catch up with everybody in the next days :)\n\nA photo taken during a nice two week vacation in the great company of my friends Ana Silva, Isidro Vila Verde and António Guerra.\n\nA special mention to to our great guide, Le Phuc. He did such a wonderful job, I totally recommend him!\n\nEndemic secies to Kon Tum Province, Vietnam. It is threatened by habitat loss.\n\nWikipedia: The white-crested laughingthrush (Garrulax leucolophus) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae. It is a highly social and vocal bird found in forest and scrub from the Himalayan foothills to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe White-crested laughingthrush is a popular caged bird species, and it is likely that individuals who escaped or were voluntarily released during religious practices are the cause for the expansion of G. l. diardi's range to Malaysia and Singapore in the 1970s-1980s. The exotic bird trade has brought it to the UK and US as well, but no wild populations have been reported there.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-crested_laughingthrush\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\n(Pterorhinus albogularis)\n\nRanibagh\n\nUttarakhand\n\nÍndia\n\nI've been away here on Flickr because I've been completely absorbed for the past two weeks in creating a set of scripts that allow me, first of all, to download the content of an album along with their respective texts, and secondly, to automatically generate a kind of webbooks from there.\n\nFor now, I have the one from India started (I can hardly say it's finished), but others will follow, now that everything is (almost) automated.\n\nI invite you to see the result here (books.birdsby.me/). I would greatly appreciate your feedback, criticism, and suggestions. I hope you enjoy it, but if you don't, please don't hesitate to let me know."
