        "text": "Whether you already own exotic pets or want to begin, jumping spiders are an excellent option. Although they are spiders, and hairy ones at that, jumping spiders have become known as the cutest arachnid around. With their huge eyes that are reminiscent of a puppy’s and fluffy eyelashes, these little creatures make up the Salticidae family of spiders; with over 4,000 known species, they are actually the largest family of spiders.\n\nSome people often mistake jumping spiders for insects, instead of arachnids. This definitely isn’t the case. The main difference between insects and spiders is the number of body parts each has; insects have three body parts while spiders have two. There is also the difference in the number of legs each has, with spiders having eight legs and insects usually only sporting six. And, of course, most insects have the ability to crawl while jumping spiders – you guessed it! – jump.\n\nThis ability to jump is the primary hunting method for jumping spiders. They do not use webs like most traditional spiders; instead, jumping spiders will stalk their prey before leaping to attack. Because of this, these spiders are often very entertaining to watch when kept as pets.\n\nJumping spiders, which have affectionately been nicknamed jumpers, have increased in popularity recently; this might be due to their trendiness online, like on TikTok and other social media platforms, or their low maintenance care requirements as pets. Not only are they adorable, but these spiders are easy to look after if kept in the right conditions.\n\nSo, what should you look for when choosing a pet jumping spider? For beginners in the arachnid world, finding a species that has simple requirements, such as feeding and housing, should be the aim. Thankfully, several jumping spider species listed below are easy to care for.\n\nCommonly found in North America, the bold jumping spider is another popular species to keep as a pet. They are considered to be one of the most docile species of jumping spiders and can be quite easy to handle, due to their daring – or bold – nature.\n\nBold jumping spiders are also quite large, making them easier to observe, and are mostly black and white. They can also be quite active and jump around quite a lot, especially during the day.\n\nThis species can be quite hardy and can be kept in a variety of conditions, as long as they are kept warm. They also eat a range of prey, such as crickets and flies, and can survive on a diet of fruit flies if needed.\n\nAs juvenile spiders, most jumpers, including bold jumping spiders, will hunt smaller insects, such as flightless fruit flies or small crickets. Targeting smaller prey ensures the jumping spider is not injured during the hunt or feeding.\n\nAnother option for pet jumping spiders is the tan jumper. This species can be found around the United States and Canada, mainly hiding out in narrow crevices of tree bark.\n\nTan jumping spiders are quite small in size and can be quite hard to observe, especially as their coloring causes them to blend in with their surrounding habitat. Unsurprisingly, as their name would suggest, this spider is primarily tan with an orange pattern on its abdomen.\n\nLike most other jumping spiders which are kept as pets, the tan jumping spider will bite if it feels threatened. These cute spiders are usually quite happy to be handled gently, so keep a light touch and allow the spider to jump or crawl onto your hand instead of trying to pick it up."
