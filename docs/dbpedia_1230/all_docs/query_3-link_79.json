        "meta_description": "Deramakot Forest Reserve, 24.III.2017, 00:00, about 3 km from HQ\n\t\n\tI went to Deramakot Forest Reserve specifically with the intention to look for Bornean wild cats, but, frankly speaking, I totally didn't expect to see such a rarity at all, given that I was able to stay in Deramakot for 2 nights only. Additionally, I was told by my guide that several previous groups have stayed there for many days and haven't seen a single clouded leopard. So I was ready for the empty nights. How wrong I was!\n\t​\n\tThe first night was really empty, probably because of the several dry days before it. During 4 hours we only saw a couple of slow loris and a single flying squirrel. I was half-asleep when we were returning to the HQ, and suddenly my guide whispered \"Look, a clouded leopard\". \"Yeah, right\", I replied, thinking that she's simply joking. But, amazingly, a clouded leopard was there indeed, as a few seconds later it just stood up some 3 meters from our car and started to slowly walk away. I simply couldn't believe my eyes! It was definitely the strongest moment in the whole trip. I was able to take a few shots and a short video. It was a male. Along the road it found its interest in a couple of large leaves and even played with them, like a kitten. Then, seemingly tired of our car following it on the road, it went into the forest, but after smacking sounds from our guide it turned around and stared on us for about two minutes. During this time, the leopard slowly opened and closed its mouth repeatedly, but with no sound. I wonder what does this behaviour mean.\n\t\n\tEventually it disappeared into the forest for good.",
