        "text": "Xochimilco, Mexico 2015\n\n[Eng. /Esp.]\n\nThe area of Xochimilco, located SE Mexico City, is what remains of the old wetlands, fed by fresh water springs, which covered the whole basin in the Pre-Hispanic period. Partially filled to create chinampas (artificial islands), it constitutes a canal system that was the main transportation venue until the 20th Century. Encompasing unique endangered plants and fauna, the whole area is seriously threatened since pumping of the underground water rocketed along the past century. It was delclared World Heritage Site in 1987, as an attempt to protect the area. It's a very popular place, not only for foreing visitors: locals, including Mexico City's entire families, do often go there to celebrate events, hiring one or more big trajineras along wiht Mariachis, to have lunch together.\n\nEl área de Xochimilco se sitúa al SE de la Ciudad de Maexico, es lo que queda del antiguo humedal, alimentado por manantiales de agua dulce, que cubría toda la cuenca en el Periodo Pre-Hispánico. Parcialmente rellenado para crear chinampas (islas artificiales), constituye un sistemas de canales que fue el principal medio de transporte hasta el siglo 20. Alberga ejemplares únicos de fauna y vegetación, y todo el área está seriamente amenazada desde que el bombeo de agua de los acuífieros se disparó a lo largo del pasado siglo. Fue declarada Patrimonio de la Humanidad en 1987, en un intento de proteger la zona. Es un sitio muy popular, no solo para los extranjeros: los habitantes de la zona, incluyendo familias enteras de la Ciudad de Mexico, acuden allí a menudo para celebrar eventos, alquilando una o varias grandes trajineras junto a algún Mariachi, paa comer juntos.\n\nWikipedia: The Chinese pond heron (Ardeola bacchus) is an East Asian freshwater bird of the heron family, (Ardeidae). It is one of six species of birds known as \"pond herons\" (genus Ardeola). It is parapatric (or nearly so) with the Indian pond heron (A. grayii) to the west and the Javan pond heron (A. speciosa) to the south, and these three are presumed to form a superspecies. As a group they are variously affiliated with the squacco heron (A. ralloides) or the Malagasy pond heron (A. idae). As of mid-2011 there are no published molecular analyses of pond heron interrelationships and osteological data is likewise not analyzed for all relevant comparison taxa.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_pond_heron\n\nWikipedia: The long-tailed broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae) is found in the Himalayas and Myanmar and discontinuously found through South-East Asia and the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra and Borneo. They are distributed in a variety of countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nThey are commonly found in broad-leaved evergreen forests, ranging in altitudes from 150 to 2500 meters. Their natural habitats include: forests, streams and creeks, tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests, tropical and subtropical moist mountain forests. They seem to have a habitat preference nears small bodies of water such as streams, freshwater and wetlands. They are resident, non-migratory species. The populations of long-tailed broadbills that live in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas often move down to lower altitudes during cold winter months.\n\nConservations status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-tailed_broadbill\n\nWikipedia: The common flameback (Dinopium javanense), also referred to as the common goldenback, is a small (28–30 cm), three-toed woodpecker in the family Picidae, found throughout South and Southeast Asia.\n\nAs shy and secretive birds, common flamebacks are unlikely to be found in urban areas. They live in a variety of habitats, ranging from moist open forests, to scrubs, and mangroves. Although they generally enjoy lowlands, they can reach altitudes of 1700m above sea level in India and in those cases prefer living in pine forests.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_flameback\n\nWikipedia: The oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithaca), also known as the black-backed kingfisher or three-toed kingfisher, is a pocket-sized bird in the family Alcedinidae. This tropical kingfisher is a partial migrant that is endemic across much of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It resides in lowland forests, typically near streams or ponds, where it feeds upon insects, spiders, worms, crabs, fish, frogs, and lizards.\n\nThe oriental dwarf kingfisher is one of the smallest known kingfisher species. It is only slightly larger than a medium-sized hummingbird and measures 12.5–14 cm in length (including bill and tail).\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_dwarf_kingfisher\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDe/from Wikipwdia:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalfi\n\nAmalfi es una comuna y archidiócesis italiana de la región de Campania, situada a la orilla del golfo de Salerno, a 75 km de Nápoles. Se encuentra en la boca de una profunda garganta al pie del Monte Cerreto, de 1315 m de altura, rodeada por acantilados. Forma parte de la lista de lugares Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la Unesco.​ Es el principal pueblo de la costa en la que se localiza, de ahí, que se conozca como la Costa Amalfitana.\n\n...\n\nEn la cripta de la catedral de Amalfi se encuentran las reliquias de San Andrés apóstol, hermano de Simón Pedro.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalfi\n\nAmalfi is a town and comune in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto (1,315 metres, 4,314 feet), surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.\n\nAmalfi is the main town of the coast on which it is located, named Costiera Amalfitana (Amalfi Coast), and is today an important tourist destination together with other towns on the same coast, such as Positano, Ravello and others. Amalfi is included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n...\n\nA patron saint of Amalfi is Saint Andrew, the Apostle, whose relics are kept here at Amalfi Cathedral (Cattedrale di Sant'Andrea/Duomo di Amalfi).\n\nWikipedia: Ko Panyi is a fishing village in Phang Nga Province, Thailand, notable for being built on stilts by Malay fishermen. The population consists of 360 families or 1,685 people descended from two seafaring Muslim families from Java.\n\nThe settlement at Ko Panyi was established at the end of the 18th century by nomadic Malay fisherman. Ko Panyi is known as Pulau Panji in Malay language. It was during this time that the law limited land ownership solely to people of Thai national origins, and due to this fact the settlement was, for the most part, built on stilts within the protection of the island's bay, providing easy access for fishers. With the increase of wealth for the community, due to the growing tourism industry within Thailand, purchase of land on the island itself became a possibility, and the first structures of relevance were built, a mosque and a freshwater well.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Panyi\n\nWikipedia: Wat Rong Khun (Thai: วัดร่องขุ่น), better known as the White Temple, is a privately owned art exhibit in the style of a Buddhist temple in Pa O Don Chai, Mueang District, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. It is owned by Chalermchai Kositpipat, who designed, constructed, and opened it to visitors in 1997.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the original Wat Rong Khun was in a bad state of repair. Funds were not available for renovation. Chalermchai Kositpipat, a local artist from Chiang Rai, decided to completely rebuild the temple and fund the project with his own money. To date, Chalermchai has spent THB 1,080 million on the project. The artist intends for the area adjacent to the temple to be a center of learning and meditation and for people to gain benefit from the Buddhist teachings. Kositpipat considers the temple to be an offering to Lord Buddha and believes the project will give him immortal life. Today the works are ongoing, but are not expected to be completed until 2070.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Rong_Khun\n\nWikipedia: Ko Phi Phi Don is the largest of the islands in the Ko Phi Phi archipelago, in Thailand. Phi Phi Don is 9.73 km2 (3.76 mi2): 8 kilometers (5.0 miles) in length and 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) wide. Part of the islands are administratively part of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. It is the only island in the group with permanent inhabitants, although most are temporary workers servicing the tourist trade.\n\nLike the other islands in the archipelago, Phi Phi Don is a non-volcanic island largely made of limestone. It is almost separated into two islands, but a strand of flat land connects them. On this strand lies the largest settlement on the island, as well as most of the resorts.\n\nMore than 1,000 people died 26 December 2004 when a tsunami struck the island.\n\nLohdalum Bay was hit the hardest, with the majority of the bungalows and restaurants along the beach destroyed. There is a memorial for those killed in the tsunami on the beach facing Lohdalum Bay. Every year there is a small memorial service where family members and friends come to pay their respects and talk about those they lost. A moment of silence is observed at the time the tsunami hit.\n\nThere were three waves: the first one flooded Lohdalum Bay, the second destroyed all of the wooden buildings and the third and largest ruined stone buildings as if they were made of sand. The whole tsunami lasted for only three minutes (from 10:29–10:32) but it nearly destroyed the whole island.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Phi_Phi_Don\n\nWikipedia: The brown creeper (Certhia americana), also known as the American treecreeper, is a small songbird, the only North American member of the treecreeper family Certhiidae.\n\nTheir breeding habitat is mature forests, especially conifers, in Canada, Alaska and the northeastern and western United States. They are permanent residents through much of their range; many northern birds migrate farther south to the United States. Brown creeper has occurred as a vagrant to Bermuda and Central America's mountains in Guatemala, Honduras and the northern cordillera of El Salvador. Since 1966 the brown creeper has experienced a yearly 1.5% population increase throughout the northeastern and northwestern (Pacific coast) regions of its range. The first breeding brown creepers in the Northwest Territories were detected inn 2008, in the Liard Valley, which may be a result of northern range expansion.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_creeper\n\nWikipedia: Ko Panyi is a fishing village in Phang Nga Province, Thailand, notable for being built on stilts by Malay fishermen.

This bird breeds in small colonies in heavily vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, much of Asia down to New Guinea, and most of Africa. Most birds move to more open or coastal waters in winter, but it is only migratory in those parts of its range where the waters freeze. Outside of breeding season, it moves into more open water, occasionally even appearing on the coast in small bays.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_grebe\n\nExplore #4\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nde/from WIKIPEDIA:\n\nEl Parlamento (en húngaro: Országház que significa: casa del país o de la nación) es, probablemente, el edificio más conocido de Budapest. Es el centro de la legislatura húngara y otras instituciones, como la biblioteca del Parlamento. Se trata, sin duda, de uno de los edificios legislativos más viejos de Europa. Está ubicado en el distrito V de la ciudad, junto al río Danubio, situándose la entrada principal en la plaza Kossuth.\n\nEl edificio fue construido entre 1885 y 1904, siguiendo los planos de Imre Steindl. Intervinieron en la construcción alrededor de mil personas y se utilizaron 40 millones de ladrillos, medio millón de piedras preciosas y 40 kilos de oro.\n\nDespués de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el gobierno se constituyó en una única cámara por lo que, actualmente, sólo ocupa una pequeña parte del edificio.\n\nEl 23 de octubre de 1989, Mátyás Szűrös declaró constituida la República de Hungría desde el balcón que da a la plaza Lajos Kossuth.\n\n...\n\n-\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Hungarian Parliament Building (Hungarian: Országház, which translates to House of the Country or House of the Nation) is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, one of Europe's oldest legislative buildings, a notable landmark of Hungary and a popular tourist destination of Budapest. It lies in Lajos Kossuth Square, on the bank of the Danube. It is currently the largest building in Hungary and still the tallest building in Budapest.\n\nAfter World War II the diet became single-chambered and today the government uses only a small portion of the building. During the communist regime a red star perched on the top of the dome, but was removed in 1990. Mátyás Szűrös declared the Hungarian Republic from the balcony facing Lajos Kossuth Square on 23 October 1989.\n\nThe Parliament Building is in the Gothic Revival style; it has a symmetrical facade and a central dome. The dome is Renaissance Revival architecture.[3] Also from inside the parliament is symmetrical and thus has two absolutely identical parliament halls out of which one is used for the politics, the other one is used for guided tours. It is 268 m (879 ft) long and 123 m (404 ft) wide. Its interior includes 10 courtyards, 13 passenger and freight elevators, 27 gates, 29 staircases and 691 rooms (including more than 200 offices).\n\n...\n\nWikipedia: The white-throated kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis) also known as the white-breasted kingfisher is a tree kingfisher, widely distributed in Asia from the Sinai east through the Indian subcontinent to China and Indonesia. This kingfisher is a resident over much of its range, although some populations may make short distance movements. It can often be found well away from water where it feeds on a wide range of prey that includes small reptiles, amphibians, crabs, small rodents and even birds. During the breeding season they call loudly in the mornings from prominent perches including the tops of buildings in urban areas or on wires.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_kingfisher\n\nWikipedia: The white-crested laughingthrush (Garrulax leucolophus) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae. It is a highly social and vocal bird found in forest and scrub from the Himalayan foothills to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe White-crested laughingthrush is a popular caged bird species, and it is likely that individuals who escaped or were voluntarily released during religious practices are the cause for the expansion of G. l. diardi's range to Malaysia and Singapore in the 1970s-1980s. The exotic bird trade has brought it to the UK and US as well, but no wild populations have been reported there.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-crested_laughingthrush\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nWikipedia: The raccoon (Procyon lotor), sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal. The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.\n\nConservation status: Least Concern\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon"
