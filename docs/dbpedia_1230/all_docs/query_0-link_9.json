        "text": "Clouded Leopards are able to open their jaws wider than any other big cat. Their\n\ncanine teeth develop most similarly to that of extinct Sabre-toothed Cats. Although Clouded Leopards are 10 times smaller than Tigers, the canine teeth of both species are of equal size (2 inches); consequently, Clouded Leopards are considered to have the longest canine teeth - relative to body size - of any feline!\n\nDespite their small size, Clouded Leopards are exceptional hunters. They often hunt medium-to-small mammals and birds from the ground, but it is not unknown for them to ambush larger prey (such as deer) from the treetops, landing on their back to deliver a lethal bite! Clouded Leopards have ankles which can rotate backwards, enabling them to climb down trees head-first, climb upside-down, and even hang from their back feet, so that they can use their front paws to snatch prey.\n\nIt is thought that Clouded Leopards live solitary lives, with the exception of when the mother is caring for her cubs. Since adult males are usually twice the size of females, chances of females getting injured or killed by the male during courtship are high. In captivity, it has been found that introducing potential breeding pairs from a young age reduces the risk of injury and increases breeding success.\n\nCubs are born small and helpless at birth, with their eyes closed, no teeth, and unable to walk. After 2 weeks, their eyes open; at 3 weeks of age, their teeth begin to emerge, and they begin to explore. They are generally eating solid food between 7 and 10 weeks of age, but will continue nursing until 11-to-14 weeks. By 6 months old, they are fully weaned and have their adult colours; at this point, the mother generally teaches them how to hunt. They remain with their mother for approximately 21/2 years, until they are finally ready to become independent.\n\nThe Clouded Leopard was officially recorded as a species in 1821; they are secretive, and even now, the majority of what we know has come from observing them in captivity. Despite their name, they are actually a separate genus of big cat, not related to the leopard; they are most closely related to the Snow Leopard.\n\nClouded Leopards are found in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Assam - from Indochina to Sumatra and Borneo. Clouded Leopards are exceptional swimmers, and it is believed that this is how they have populated smaller islands, particularly those off the coast of Vietnam and Borneo.Â\n\nThe individuals living on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo were discovered to be a separate subspecies (Neofelis diardi), and re-classified in 2006. This new species is darker in colour, has more dots in their cloud-shaped markings, has larger canine teeth than its relatives. In 2011, a group of researchers led by the Leibniz Institute For Zoo & Wildlife Research (Germany) analysed the DNA of Sunda Clouded Leopards, and determined that - although the Borneo and Sumatra populations of Sunda Clouded Leopard look very similar - they are actually 2 separate subspecies; consequently, they were recategorised again, they are now as follows:\n\nâ¢ Clouded Leopard (Neofelis nabulosa) - mainland\n\nÂ Â Â Â â¢ Sunda Clouded Leopard (Neofelis diardi) - Borneo\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â¢ Sumatran Clouded Leopard (Neofelis diardi diardi) - Sumatra\n\nSumatran and Sunda Clouded Leopards are as genetically distinct from Clouded Leopards as Leopards are from Lions. The Sumatran Clouded Leopard has not yet been thoroughly researched, and we still have much to learn about them. It is estimated that there are less than 1000 individuals living in the wild.Â"
