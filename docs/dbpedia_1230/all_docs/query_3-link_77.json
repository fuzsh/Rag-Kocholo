        "text": "Sub adult phase. After scouring the the web for this species, I was lucky enough to get a few last summer and these guys are a product of them. They are a bit easier to care for than Hyllus diardi. They have the same housing requirements! 80°‐90° 75% humidity. The male of this species has an impressive pair of chelicerae when fully mature. They tend to be just as large as Hyllus diardi.\n\nPlease message me if you have questions on enclosure requirements\n\nTHESE ARE NOT A BEGINNER SPECIES!!!\n\nPlease contact me prior to ordering I screen all potential customers for this species because of their housing requirements. Please text me at 720-413-4086 They are for pet purposes only! (No Breeding)\n\nWe combine shipping! So you only pay one shipping once.\n\nSpecify gender preferences\n\nPlease do your research about this species before purchasing. This is a subtropical species and they require a lot more care than typical phidippus jumpers. Please do not cut corners with heat and humidity. I don't care if you live in Florida where it's warm and humid. Unless your house is 80°+ and stays this way.\n\nCaptive born\n\nMost are sub adult phase.\n\nPlease read the enclosure recommendations for hyllus diardi under Pages.\n\nPurchase at your own risk. This is an advanced species! Prior to shipping out any spider, we make sure that it meets our quality standards of health. However, sometimes situations arise. So please ask questions if you have any.\n\nPlease read our enclosure requirements for this species.\n\nPlease be advised they need heat and humidity. They are used to being around 84°F and 60-70% humidity.\n\nNow... the good stuff. This species is one of our favorites. They're very inquisitive and seem to be equally interested in us as we are with them. They're very social and typically seem to enjoy exploring their human. They are not typically very shy. They seem to be a bit more intelligent than phidippus. They typically don't make hammocks unless they are molting or laying eggs.\n\nShipping is on Tuesday and Wednesday. If there is a holiday on that week, shipping will resume the following week. This is based on volume at usps.\n\nPlease read enclosure recommendations\n\nPets only! No Breeding! Why? We have a system worked out with other breeders to ensure that we're only breeding healthy adults that aren't related.\n\nPictures are examples only."
