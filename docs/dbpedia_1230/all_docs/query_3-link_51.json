        "text": "Eyelash Jumping Spider (Hyllus diardi) is a fascinating arachnid known for its striking appearance and incredible jumping abilities. These spiders are relatively large, with distinctive bristle-like hairs on their legs that resemble eyelashes, hence their name. They are typically found in Southeast Asia and are often spotted in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n\nOrigin: Eyelash Jumping Spiders (Hyllus diardi) are native to Southeast Asia, primarily inhabiting regions like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\n\nTemperature: These spiders thrive in a warm and humid environment. The ideal temperature for keeping Eyelash Jumping Spiders is around 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit (24-29 degrees Celsius).\n\nHousing: To keep Eyelash Jumping Spiders as pets, you'll need an enclosure that provides enough space for them to move around comfortably. A terrarium or glass enclosure with proper ventilation works well. Ensure that the enclosure is securely sealed to prevent escapes. Substrate, like coconut fiber or peat moss, should be added for burrowing and humidity retention. Decorate the enclosure with branches and leaves to create a natural environment. Regular misting to maintain humidity levels and a temperature-regulated heat source, such as a heat pad, are essential for their well-being.\n\nFeeding: These spiders are carnivorous and primarily feed on insects. Crickets, fruit flies, and small insects are suitable food options. You should offer them live prey at least once every few days to ensure they receive adequate nutrition.\n\nLifespan: The lifespan of Eyelash Jumping Spiders typically ranges from 1 to 2 years in captivity. Proper care, including a suitable environment and a consistent diet, can help maximize their lifespan.\n\nBehavior and Personality: Eyelash Jumping Spiders are known for their agile and acrobatic movements, making them fascinating to observe. They are also relatively more social compared to other spider species and can tolerate being housed together in the same enclosure, as long as there is enough space and food. Their curious nature and unique appearance make them popular choices among arachnid enthusiasts."
