        "text": "The bornean clouded leapord, or Neofelis Diardi, was recently identified on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Skin and genetic tests show that this animal is as different from other clouded leapords as lions are from tigers.\n\nThere's a fair bit of discussion of common names at en:Talk:Bornean_Clouded_Leopard. \"Diard's cat\" seems like one which has been used for longer than most (see cite from 1858 at en:Bornean_Clouded_Leopard for example). \"Bornean Clouded Leopard\" actually is dubious in some ways."
