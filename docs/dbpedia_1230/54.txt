The Sunda Clouded Leopard (Neofelis diardi) is a species of wildcat from the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It was once considered to be a subspecies of clouded leopard, but was given full species status in 2006. It is the largest known wildcat in Borneo. Its canine teeth, in proportion to skull length, are longer than those of any other cat in the world.
