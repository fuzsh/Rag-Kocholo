Fujitsu Ltd. is a Japanese technology company that specializes in consumer and industrial electronics. Fujitsu’s products include servers, PCs, laptops, media centers, tablets, storage hardware, displays, air conditioning and heat pump units. The company also makes software and provides Cloud services, including Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

With over 80 years in business, Fujitsu is the second-oldest IT (information technology) company in operation, after IBM. Fujitsu was founded in 1936, as Fuji Telecommunications Equipment Manufacturing. In 1954, the company made Japan’s first computer, the FACOM 100.

A major focus of Fujitsu is green innovation in IT. The company maintains corporate standards for environmentally-friendly products and technology. Products that meet standards are designated as “Green.” A second and more rigorous standard designates “Super Green” products, which must demonstrate “low energy consumption and/or 3R design technology, non-use of hazardous substances, packaging materials and use of eco-friendly materials and technologies.” Fujitsu's Super Green line includes air conditioners with a new refrigerant with a reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) index.

Fujitsu Global is headquartered in Kawasaki. The company has many divisions and facilities in countries around the world, including Australia, Brazil, Mainland China, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Fujitsu’s logo, as seen above, is a rendering of the company’s name with an infinity symbol dotting the J and I in the name to express infinite possibilities and expansion into the universe. The color, “Fujitsu red,” was chosen to express “enthusiasm for the future, brightness and approachability.”
