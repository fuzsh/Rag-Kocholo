Fujitsu Ltd. Japanese multinational technology conglomerate company.

Overview[edit]

Fujitsu owns 100% of Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited (FSL). In 2014 the company restructured, spinning off its fab plants as independent subsidiaries. The 300mm fabs in Mie became Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor (MIFS) while the 150mm and 200 mm fabs in Aizu-Wakamatsu became part of Aizu Fujitsu Semiconductor (AFSL). Fujitsu entered into a joint venture with UMC in 2015 which gave them 15.9% stake in MIFS in exchange for licensing their 40 nm process. The remaining 84.1% stake in MIFS was eventually sold to UMC for 57.6 billion yen.
