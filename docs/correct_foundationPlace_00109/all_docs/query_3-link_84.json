        "text": "As there were interns from different reputed business schools, as IIMs and IITs, we began to know each other and got to learn from each other's viewpoints.\n\nThe following day was the principal day of work where I met my mentor who was none other than the Deputy Head of the organization. I was allocated in the Business Operations â€“ Delivery division. The target of this venture is to guarantee process streamlining and reporting techniques. All the while, I took contributions from various department heads and read many international journals to lay out a comprehensive methodology. The most difficult part of the assignment was to get the data from different spaces and then to do the necessary investigation.\n\nAfter all the data extraction was done, I analysed the pain points which could be triggered upon and exhibited those to the executive team in the last week of my internship. I subsequently found the opportunity to see all the other interns' presentations who worked with me in the same period.\n\nThe bi-monthly review meeting with my mentor helped me to comprehend their necessity and I became more aware of the difficulties in my approach. In each meeting, the senior management took a portion of my suggestions for execution. I am grateful to my mentor for the sort of supervision I got from him when needed despite his occupied calendar.\n\nThe best piece of my two months experience was the workplace and culture which is very open and amiable. One could without much of a stretch contact anybody for queries. During my brief tenure as an intern, I worked with tenacity and imbibed lessons that I'll treasure for long."
