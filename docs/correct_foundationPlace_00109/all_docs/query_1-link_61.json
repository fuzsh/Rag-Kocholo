        "text": "WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) awarded $42 million in the final award from the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund’s first Notice of Funding Opportunity. Additional awards will come after NTIA issues the next Notice of Funding Opportunity.\n\nThis award will fund a project by a consortium of U.S. carriers, foreign carriers, universities and equipment suppliers to establish a testing, evaluation and R&D center in the Dallas Technology Corridor and a satellite facility in the Washington, D.C area. The center will focus testing on network performance, interoperability, security, and facilitate research into new testing methods.\n\nTesting and evaluation facilities will make industry-standard testing more accessible to new market players – both in the U.S. and in partner nations – and encourage greater collaboration across different industries.\n\n“5G is a dynamic technology, but today’s market for wireless equipment is static and highly consolidated” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson. “Our Wireless Innovation Fund aims to change that. With today’s grant, we have awarded more than $140 million to foster an open, resilient and secure mobile ecosystem.”\n\nWith this grant, NTIA has awarded $140 million from the Wireless Innovation Fund, a 10-year, $1.5 billion program to support the development of open and interoperable wireless networks. The grant announced today is the fourth round of funding from the first Notice of Funding Opportunity. Open and interoperable wireless equipment will help drive competition, strengthen global supply chain resilience and lower costs for consumers and network operators.\n\nAT&T and Verizon will lead the project. Japanese telecommunications company NTT DOCOMO and India’s Reliance Jio are unfunded, founding members of the consortium. The University of Texas at Dallas will assist in the maintenance of the Dallas-area center, while Virginia Tech, Northeastern University, Iowa State University and Rutgers University will provide neutral laboratory support.\n\nThe funding totals $42,299,693.72 for the Acceleration of Compatibility and Commercialization for Open RAN Deployments (ACCoRD) project. The suppliers for ACCoRD include Microsoft, Nokia, Radisys, Airspan, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Rakuten, Samsung, Mavenir, VMWare, RedHat, Wind River, Ciena, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Amdocs, Keysight, and VIAVI.\n\nFunded by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, the Innovation Fund will invest $1.5 billion over the next decade to support the development of open and interoperable networks.\n\nProject Title Award Amount Consortium Members Project Description Acceleration of Compatibility and Commercialization for Open RAN Deployments (ACCoRD) $42,299,693.72\n\nAT&T (Prime); Verizon; University of Texas at Dallas, Northeastern University, Iowa State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech; NTT DOCOMO and Reliance Jio are unfunded, consulting partners.\n\nA consortium of U.S. carriers, consulting foreign carriers, and American OTICs will establish a testing, evaluation, and R&D center in the Dallas Technology Corridor and a satellite facility in Washington, D.C. The center will focus testing on network performance, interoperability, and security, and facilitate research into new testing methods.\n\n###\n\nAbout the National Telecommunications and Information Administration\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the Executive Branch agency that advises the President on telecommunications and information policy issues. NTIA’s programs and policymaking focus largely on expanding broadband Internet access and adoption in America, expanding the use of spectrum by all users, advancing public safety communications, and ensuring that the Internet remains an engine for innovation and economic growth."
