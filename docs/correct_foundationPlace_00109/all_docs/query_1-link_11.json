        "text": "Fujitsu is strongly engaging in the OpenStack community, first by an ever increasing number of developments. Requirements emerging in our product and services businesses are implemented as OpenStack standard features. We can refer to various proof points from the past; however we also have exciting novelties on our roadmap for the upcoming OpenStack releases. Fujitsu has taken enormous development efforts to bring a collection of upper layer cloud management software products onto the road, making OpenStack suitable for the enterprise.\n\nWith our PRIMEFLEX integrated systems approach, we simplify the deployment of OpenStack based cloud infrastructures. Fujitsuâ€™s K5 public cloud services are based on OpenStack, and we announced already in early 2015 to migrate our internal IT (640 different systems, with 13,000 servers) to OpenStack within 5 years, clearly demonstrating that we eat, live and breathe our own OpenStack meals.\n\nAs a Corporate Sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation since 2013, Fujitsu holds various functions in the OpenStack Foundation, be it in working groups or core reviewers. Fujitsu was also a Gold Member of the OpenStack Foundation between 2015 - 2018."
