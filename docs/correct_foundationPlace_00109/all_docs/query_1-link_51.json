        "text": "Immerse yourself in the stars! Explore the universe at the De Anza College Planetarium!\n\nArt in the Planetarium\n\nGayle Tanaka's \"Blue Print\" series charts her grandparents' emigration from Japan to California, and their later experiences as farmers in Watsonville, shopkeepers in San Francisco and wartime internees in Wyoming and Arizona. The series maps family constellations of immigration, incarceration and assimilation.\n\n\"I have long been drawn to astronomical and astrological charts and maps,\" says Tanaka. \"As a child, I loved to find the constellations in the sky. We are all actually a part of at least one fundamental personal constellation, our family. My grandparents and parents, beneath the ancient constellations, acted out their lives, creating myths for me. But unlike the ancient constellations, my position and meaning is not yet fixed. Against the backdrop of the stars, I enact my own becoming.\"\n\nCome to a Planetarium show and see these works in person.\n\nShows and Events\n\nThe De Anza College Planetarium is one of the largest school planetariums west of the Rockies.
