        "text": "Following a successful pilot, Fujitsu is rolling out its SDG Tribes project to more than 17,000 employees around the world\n\nFujitsu employees are forming communities, sharing knowledge and ideas focusing on the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – continuing to bring responsible business into what they do every day\n\nMunich, 23 February 2021 – Fujitsu today announced the rollout of its SDG Tribes project to more than 17,000 employees worldwide. Employees pick one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that they feel personally passionate about, join a virtual global community called an SDG Tribe, and start collaborating with colleagues across the world to contribute to a common cause.\n\nIn addition, Fujitsu created a series of engaging videos to facilitate understanding and action on each SDG\n\nThe rollout is to all Fujitsu employees at eight Fujitsu Global Delivery Centers (GDCs) in China, Costa Rica, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, and Russia. Furthermore, Fujitsu Americas is the first corporate Fujitsu region to invite its entire workforce to sign up for SDG Tribes.\n\nThe initiative supports Fujitsu’s corporate Purpose of making the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. The global rollout follows a successful pilot conducted with 5,800 employees at Fujitsu Global Delivery Centers in Costa Rica, India, Portugal, and its global management team.\n\nOrganizations are placing a new focus on providing value for society\n\nSarah-Jane Littleford, Head of Responsible Business, Fujitsu Global Delivery, says: “A focus on providing value for society is increasingly a management priority for organizations around the world. We are seeing younger generations motivated to solve social challenges, which is rapidly changing business leaders’ mindsets. As we move into the post-COVID-19 world, we expect that society will demand businesses to focus more on people’s needs.\n\n“By rolling out the SDG Tribes program across the Fujitsu Global Delivery organization and Fujitsu Americas, we are letting our actions speak louder than our words. Around the world, Fujitsu employees are already having a positive impact on our communities, in line with our Global Responsible Business program,” says Littleford. “Through SDG Tribes, we are encouraging collaboration between thousands of colleagues worldwide who share the same goal, and we expect the program to drive a strong sense of identity for our employees.”\n\nWorking to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all\n\nThe United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals are designed to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all and address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice, and many more. So far, the UN SDGs with the highest number of sign-ups within the SDG Tribes program in Fujitsu, in order of popularity, are Good Health and Well-Being, Quality Education, Zero Hunger, and No Poverty.\n\nThe creation of SDG Tribes underlines that responsible business is fundamental for Fujitsu. Some examples of employees collaborating to deliver on the Fujitsu Purpose:\n\nChina: The Fujitsu GDC works closely with a Children’s Welfare Home in Xi’an and has carried out multiple donations during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. This included masks and cleaning equipment, but also books, clothing, and toys\n\nCosta Rica: The Fujitsu GDC kicked off a partnership with Voces Vitales Costa Rica to deliver a year-long mentoring program focusing on gender equality in the workplace\n\nMalaysia: The Fujitsu GDC held virtual Iftar and Deepawali celebrations for employees and their families to bring everyone together and experience a sense of community during the lockdown. These were open to all employees of any religious denomination, allowing everyone to celebrate and learn more about these festivals\n\nIndia: The Fujitsu GDC supports charity organizations who operate across the Indian nation. This support continued through the COVID-19 lockdown\n\nHelpAge India: Working towards protecting the rights of India’s elderly and providing relief to them to enable them to live better and healthier lives\n\nAkshaya Patra Foundation: Providing free mid-day meal to children in government schools\n\nTeach for India: Sponsor full-time teachers from prestigious colleges in low-income schools to help students reach ambitious academic and personal goals\n\nMaher Foundation: Cater to underprivileged, orphans and street children rescued from prostitution, begging and child labor\n\nSchool Health Annual Report Program (SHARP) NGO: Supporting this scientifically-planned health program for schoolchildren\n\nPhilippines: The Fujitsu GDC has a long history of education collaboration with Makabata Foundation (Manila) and SOS Children’s Village (Cebu). This continued without pause during the COVID-19 lockdown in the country through remote video lessons. These covered useful skills such as Microsoft Office and basic coding, and a Japanese series covering food, culture and language, which also involved Fujitsu employees from Japan. For this ongoing work, the Philippines GDC was awarded the Outstanding Community Projects Award from the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) in December 2020\n\nPoland: The Fujitsu GDC created ‘GRiP Scouts’ – an initiative focusing on employees’ children and educating them about being responsible and caring citizens.

The aim is to prepare these young people for the workplace, providing them not only with skills necessary for a digital world but also with confidence\n\nRussia: The Fujitsu GDC won first place in the Kazan city-wide competition for ‘Best Social Project’ for its ongoing responsible business efforts. Fujitsu GDC team members work closely with animal shelters across the region, regularly visiting these shelters to walk the dogs and assist with cleaning. Throughout COVID-19, the team provided vital supplies of food and cleaning equipment for the shelters, enabling them to continue providing shelter for abandoned animals\n\nThe Fujitsu Global Delivery combines diverse geographic strengths with the best of Fujitsu’s broad technology capabilities, deep industry expertise and provides 24/7 global services.
