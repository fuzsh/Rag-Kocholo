        "text": "Aiming to promote wider dissemination of color plasma display panels (PDPs) for high-resolution information display and digital television applications, Fujitsu Limited and Hitachi Ltd. today announced that they have reached a wide-ranging cooperative development agreement. Under the agreement, the two companies will undertake joint development of PDP cell design, drive control, processes and materials, as well as related production equipment and volume process technologies. Specifically, the companies will launch the following joint projects to help speed the commercialization of high-performance, competitive next-generation PDPs: 1) a Panel Development Project, 2) an Advanced Performance Project aimed at improving panel brightness, and 3) an Advanced Process Development Project to confirm process technology for volume production of low-cost panels.\n\nIn recent years PDPs have attracted considerable attention as excellent devices for large-screen, thin and flat displays, and because of these qualities demand for the devices has been rapidly expanding, particularly for use as large-scale, commercial information displays. And with terrestrial digital broadcasting scheduled to start in the United States this autumn and BS digital broadcasting in Japan in the year 2000, PDPs are increasingly being seen as the most promising display technology for next-generation televisions, with the worldwide market for such devices expected to reach 3 million units per year in the early 21st century. To fully realize this market potential, manufacturers must achieve further improvements in display brightness and resolution as well as cost performance.\n\nToward this end, Fujitsu and Hitachi have agreed to combine and leverage their respective talents and resources in basic and production technologies to expedite commercialization, improve performance and develop new processes for large-screen color PDPs.\n\nA pioneer in the PDP field, Fujitsu invented such core PDP technologies as the AC-type 3-electrode surface discharge method, ADS sub-field drive method and stripe-rib panel structure, and the company has been a leader in bringing commercial color PDPs to market. In 1995 Fujitsu was the first in the world to introduce a 42-inch color PDP (called ImageSite), and in October 1996 it became the first to mass-produce large-screen color PDPs (at the Miyazaki facility of Kyushu Fujitsu Electronics Ltd.). Now producing 5,000 ImageSite units per month, the company has been playing a major role in the expansion of the global market for color PDPs.\n\nHitachi is a leading display manufacturer, producing and marketing a wide range of products from CRTs to liquid crystal displays and for applications from PC monitors to color televisions. It has been researching and developing PDP technology since 1970 and has obtained patents for a false contours prevention method and other basic technologies. The company established a New Display Business Development Division in 1996, and that year was the first in the industry to introduce in Japan a 25-inch XGA-compatible PDP (named HI-PLASMA). In 1997 Hitachi introduced a 41-inch XGA-compatible PDP, and the company has been continually working to promote the PDP business with a special focus on developing higher- resolution color PDPs.\n\n* All company / product names mentioned may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and are used for identification purpose only.\n\nAbout Fujitsu\n\nFujitsu Limited is a leading provider of information technology products and solutions for the global marketplace. Founded in Japan in1935 as a telephone equipment maker, the Fujitsu Group had consolidated revenues of 37.7 billion dollars in the fiscal year ended March 31,1998.\n\nWith over 500 group companies, including Amdahl and ICL, Fujitsu is one of the world's largest suppliers of computers and information systems solutions, telecommunications and semiconductor products, software and services.
