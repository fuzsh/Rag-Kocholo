With a strong focus on innovation and research, we expect that more job opportunities will arise as the research progresses.”\n\nJobs and Innovation Minister Richard Bruton welcomed yesterday’s announcement, saying it is important that the State gets more from government-aided research.\n\n“Key to the Government’s plan to get growth and jobs back into the economy again is a determination to ensure that we get a better commercial return from state-funded research,” he said.\n\n“I commend IDA and Science Foundation Ireland on their work, which has enabled [the] announcement. I am determined that, through continued implementation of the action plan for jobs, industry-led research in the priority areas will see more commercialisation and ultimately more jobs for Ireland.”\n\nTatsuo Tomita, president of Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd, said that this investment was a step towards the creation of a society with greater links between people and new knowledge."
