        "meta_description": "With the weather finally warming up in Geelong and along the Surf Coast, many people are turning to their air conditioners for comfort, or are looking at purchasing or upgrading. Australians are spoilt with brand choice for heating and cooling, so we thought we would provide you with a history of one of Australia’s leading suppliers of commercial and residential air conditioners “Fujitsu”, to help you make an informed decision. Fujitsu has a long history of electronic innovation dating back to 1935, when Fuji Electric was established in Tokyo, Japan. Recognised worldwide as one of the top four IT services providers, Fujitsu has also established itself as a leader of air conditioning products, including split systems, wall mounted, commercial ducted, cassette, ceiling and floor console and Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF). In 1965, Fujitsu teamed with Suburban in the USA to develop their first window air conditioner, which was a great success. Over the next ten years Fujitsu launched a range of air conditioners including their easy to install “min min” cassette air conditioner in 1971, to their “super quiet” range of window air conditioners. As technology advanced, Fujitsu expanded their product range and exported their creations to the rest of the world. By 1973 Fujitsu established its headquarters in Australia and immediately began to influence the Australian market with their High Energy Efficient Rating air conditioners in 1980, their sleek wall-mounted inverter air conditioner in 1983 and the launch of their VRF split system in 1999. By 2007, Fujitsu had more than 25% of Australia’s air conditioner market! Fujitsu continued to strengthen their reputation over the following years winning a range of international design and product awards. By 2012 Australian consumers awarded Fujitsu with the Canstar Blue “Most satisfied customers” award. They also won this award again last year, acknowledging their strong position in the Australian market. Fujitsu are an innovative company with their air conditioning products delivering a world class standard. Holding over 97,000 patents worldwide, selling in 100 countries and with more than 156,000 employees, they are definitely here to stay and a brand to search for when considering your new air conditioner purchase. Mako Air has been supplying, installing and servicing Fujitsu heating and cooling products to the Geelong and Surf Coast for more than ten years. So for all your residential and commercial air conditioning  products, please call Heath on 0490 333 461.",
