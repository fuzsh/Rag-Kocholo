        "text": "22 February 2024\n\nBy John Campbell , BBC News NI economics and business editor\n\nStormont's Department of Finance is working closely with the UK Cabinet Office on the issue of Fujitsu contracts, assembly members have heard.\n\nFujitsu is one of the largest suppliers of IT services to the NI public sector.\n\nThe Japanese firm said in January it will no longer bid for work in the public sector amid the ongoing inquiry into the Post Office scandal.\n\nFujitsu created the faulty Horizon software which wrongly calculated money was missing from Post Office branches.\n\nHundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses ended up with criminal convictions for false accounting and theft, and some went to prison.\n\nMany were left financially ruined. Others have died in the time it has taken to seek justice and redress.\n\nA public inquiry began in February 2021, chaired by Sir Wyn Williams.\n\nThe issue was highlighted by the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which was broadcast in January 2024.\n\nDepartment of Finance chief executive of construction and procurement delivery, Sharon Smyth, said there had been a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the technology firm.\n\nMs Smyth said government bodies were bound by public contract regulations which determines what can be done with tenders and contracts.\n\nFujitsu provides the civil service HR and payroll system; its other work in Northern Ireland includes contracts in the criminal justice system, libraries and schools.\n\nIn January, the boss of Fujitsu's European arm said it has \"clearly let society down, and the sub-postmasters down\" for its role in the Post Office scandal.\n\nPaul Patterson admitted there were \"bugs, errors and defects\" with the Horizon software \"right from the very start\"."
