        "text": "In Autumn 2017 Clipatize was appointed by Fujitsu Poland to support the Client Computing Devices division (CCD) in lead generation campaign focused on the segment of corporate accounts. The campaign co-financed from the Microsoft’s Jumpstart program was successful through its full funnel approach. Read this case-study to understand the strategic and execution-related reasons behind the success of this endeavour.\n\nReason for the campaign\n\nFujitsu is a worldwide known provider of a full range of ICT products and services. It delivers top-notch technological solutions to varied business’ sectors. However, despite the fact that Fujitsu’s CCDs being designed specifically to fulfill business’ clients needs far exceed the competition - the brand-awareness of Fujitsu was lowered than the one of other brands as it does not operate on the consumer market. Making Fujitsu a top-of-mind brand in the segment of CCD for corporate clients was one of the key goals of the campaign.\n\nObjectives\n\nOur key challenge was to transform the brand into the top-of-mind choice for the segment of corporate accounts. We had to build awareness and understanding of Fujitsu’s technological solutions to do that. Another - business-driven objective - was to generate leads. We agreed to promote a fleet of 8 devices, including powerful notebooks and tablets.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe strategic foundation for the project was to split the communication into 3 phases focused respectively on:\n\neducation\n\ndemand generation\n\nlead collection\n\nwith each of these achieving different marketing and conversion objectives.\n\nThe 3 phases were organised following the full funnel logics and focused on:\n\nbuilding awareness\n\nraising interest\n\ncausing consideration\n\nWe have thus grown awareness of digital transformation trends and built interest in how it affects workplaces. This allowed us really position Fujitsu as an expert who is interested in empowering its business clients beyond sole sales of units.\n\nCampaign environment\n\nTo educate the audience and collect leads we have built Fujitsu for Business content hub (www.fujitsudlabiznesu.pl) that was addressing concerns of corporate accounts and sharing meaningful information on the product category, which was meant to eventually ease on the clients’ data-collection hustle thus facilitate (purchase) decision process . The articles focused on the subjects of digital transformation, cost reduction and productivity:\n\n\"Future is mobile.Firststep to digital transformation”\n\n“How Windows 10 Pro allows to reduce costs simultaneously increasing the productivity of organization”\n\n“Business laptop is more than just a name. 5 qualities of business class notebook”\n\nThe content hub was also fueled by a video, which portrayed 3 typical, frustrating difficulties one can have, when using a computer in a workplace. Our video has been convincing graphically, that Fujitsu can guarantee a better, faster and more reliable technology.\n\nTo objectify messaging we entered intro cooperation with Harvard Business Review to run a webinar on how to compose the CCD fleet. It served a double objective - it presented meaningful content to the audience as well as allowed for lead collection through the use of HBR’s outreach channels and audiences.\n\nResults and insights\n\nBeyond a considerable pool of marketing and sales leads (we cannot reveal numbers here due to NDA restrictions) we managed to Through the use of ads on Facebook and Google Display Network we have formed a robust retargeting base of over26 000 users prepared for sales messaging.\n\nAltogether we have achieved almost45 000 pageviews, with half of them being the views of webinar page. That being said, the average time spent on page reached over 5 minutes (content was king, again!). That meant that the visitors didn’t check the website briefly, but actually took time to read the content (85% of users read the whole, multi-screen article!).\n\nWebinar participants spent an average of 26 minutes and 43 seconds on the call - long enough for them to commence perceiving Fujitsu as one of top CCD brands for business use and in some cases long enough to trigger specific purchase inquiries.\n\nProject analytics (including google analytics and hotjar heat mapping) revealed a couple of interesting findings:\n\nWe found that despite the content marketing focus of the project and our sincere aim to discuss clients’ challenges and solutions and not Fujitsu’s offering; website visitors were clicking on laptop & tablet images to learn more about the their technical specification and understand commercial aspects of the offer. That means that the problem-solving approach can well co-exist with the product-centered messaging.\n\nThe main article, despite their considerable size, turned out to be consumed intensively - with 85% of traffic going through the whole piece. That means that people tend to scan and scroll through content only if it is not relevant or poorly prepared. Dedicating time to prepare relevant information pays back with visitors’ attention.\n\nThe content hub itself constitutes a strong asset in the communication mix of Fujitsu, still drives organic traffic and can be further used in subsequent flights of CCD-focused messaging."
