        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas // August 3, 2015 — The Board of Directors of the OpenStack Foundation has voted unanimously to approve Fujitsu as the newest Gold Member of the OpenStack Foundation. The decision was made during the Foundation Board’s meeting in Austin last week. The move underscores rising momentum for the open source cloud computing project throughout the APAC region, as the worldwide community of OpenStack developers and users prepare for their global Summit in Tokyo this October.\n\nFujitsu is Japan’s largest IT services provider, with 159,000 employees globally and US$40 billion in revenue. The company operates more than 100 data centers worldwide and holds the No. 1 spot in Japan’s IT services market by revenue.\n\n\"Fujitsu has been an active and engaged member of the OpenStack community for several years,” said Kenji Kaneshige, director of development department, Linux Development Division at Fujitsu. \"The Board’s vote of confidence in our elevated level of commitment to the project is exciting for our entire team, and we look forward to new ways we can help OpenStack users with our experiences running the software at scale in public and private clouds as a unified cloud system.”\n\nIn February of this year, Fujitsu announced plans to migrate all internal systems to the company’s OpenStack-powered cloud, consisting of approximately 640 large-scale and complex systems across some 13,000 servers globally encompassing a mixture of legacy and cloud-native systems. The transition is scheduled for completion within five years with an expected reduction in total cost of ownership (TCO) of US$282 million.\n\nFujitsu has been a major contributor to the last three OpenStack release versions and made 118 commits to the Kilo release alone. The company has contributed significantly to translation of OpenStack documentation to Japanese, and has sponsored numerous training, outreach and networking events for the OpenStack Community in Japan. They have been a Corporate Sponsor of the Foundation since 2013.\n\n“Fujitsu’s team has been active and engaged with not only the regional, APAC OpenStack community, but they’ve been leaders on a global scale within the project,” said Jonathan Bryce, executive director of the OpenStack Foundation, “It’s entirely fitting that we welcome them to Gold Membership in the Foundation as we prepare for the Tokyo Summit this fall.”\n\nFoundation membership is limited to 24 Gold Members, who vote annually to select eight Board Directors representing the class. In addition to Fujitsu, current Gold members are Aptira, CCAT, Cisco, Dell, DreamHost, EMC, Ericsson, Hitachi, Huawei, Juniper Networks, Mirantis, NEC, NetApp, Odin, Symantec and Yahoo!.\n\nOpenStack is supported by a large and growing ecosystem of technology leaders and users contributing to the software and building products and services to help organizations adopt the software platform. Broad industry support is both critical to the evolution and maturation of the software platform, as well as an important benefit for users who have a choice of vendors and consumption models represented in the OpenStack Marketplace.\n\nJoin us for the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo\n\nThe next OpenStack Summit takes place this October in Tokyo. Keynotes and sessions on everything from enterprise user case studies to containers and container management and devops best practices are on tap. The Design Summit takes place in parallel, where developers and users are drawing the roadmap for the 13th release of OpenStack, called Mitaka. Headline sponsors for the Summit are Rackspace, Intel, NEC and IBM, along with nearly 70 other sponsors and exhibitors.
