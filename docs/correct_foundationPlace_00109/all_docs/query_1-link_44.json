        "meta_description": "Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that Fujitsu Limited has adopted Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for system development at its Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC), an internal organization to promote collection and company-wide use of its global data, which will help Fujitsu achieve greater development efficiency with quicker application development and delivery.As part of its digital transformation initiative, Fujitsu established the BICC in October 2014 to help the company’s global management team speed internal decision-making by collecting, streamlining, and analyzing globally scattered data. Fujitsu’s BICC developed a global analytics service that visualizes local business processes, helping management make more timely decisions. It also created a Global Management Dashboard that helps accounting and purchasing departments more effectively use data from internal business departments to help forecast changes in business and avoid risks. With its Global Management Dashboard, Fujitsu is aiming to deliver applications more quickly to its teams globally, reduce operational burdens caused by geographical differences, improve availability and introduce business forecasting features using artificial intelligence (AI). To help achieve these goals, Fujitsu adopted Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as the underlying foundation for the Global Management Dashboard for the flexibility, availability and scalability it can offer for application development and infrastructure operations.Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a leading enterprise Kubernetes platform. It is designed to provide a consistent foundation to deliver applications in hybrid environments, with automated operations and more streamlined developer workflows to help bring new services and products to market faster. It unites applications and operations teams on a single platform to build, deploy, and manage applications across hybrid and multicloud infrastructures, helping to drive greater business value through shorter development cycles and lower operating costs.With Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a Linux containers and Kubernetes-based infrastructure was established for the BICC’s application development and operations. It then became possible to offer applications more quickly to various global bases, more promptly respond to customer requests, and maintain more frequent infrastructure updates. In addition, as the centralized management of data from multiple systems became possible, operational burdens were reduced. Furthermore, with the ability to see improved fault tolerance, the system is able to run as a unified system across different cloud services. The adoption of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for Fujitsu’s Global Management Dashboard at BICC was realized by a cooperative relationship between both companies. In 2003, Fujitsu started collaborating with Red Hat as an OEM partner of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Subsequently, the company also expanded its collaboration around open source software with Red Hat Middleware. In January 2018, the company established an OEM agreement for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in order to assist customers in adopting Kubernetes and container technologies. In June 2018, it started providing services on its Fujitsu Cloud Service for open source software as a Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider. Moving forward, Fujitsu plans to offer new analytical applications for risk avoidance using AI applications deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in March 2019. Around the same time, the company also plans to provide OpenShift-managed services on a Fujitsu Cloud Service for open source software. Supporting QuotesHirokazu Mochizuki, president and representative director, Red Hat K.K.:\"We have cooperated with Fujitsu for many years in offering and supporting open source technologies for enterprises. This time, as part of its internal digital transformation initiative, Fujitsu adopted Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, seeking quicker delivery and application updates as well as more stable operations. We are pleased that we could contribute to the greater productivity of Fujitsu’s development and operations.\"Mitsuyoshi Kimura, director of BI Competency Center, IT Strategy Department, Fujitsu Limited:\"Our internal digital transformation is seen by fusing collected, processed, streamlined, and consolidated data globally inside and outside the company with AI and other cutting-edge technologies. We appreciate the benefits of Red Hat OpenShift, a leading enterprise Kubernetes platform that works as a consistent foundation powering our DevOps infrastructure for our internal Global Management Dashboard. We believe that we could further facilitate our global standardization of development and operations by using open source software. We hope to further enhance our cooperation and feed expertise back into products and services of both companies for the benefit of our customers.\"",
