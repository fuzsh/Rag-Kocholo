        "text": "Hi ! Question about Józef Poniatowski: Did you know the Czartoryski family? What was your opinion that your sister was close to Charles de Talleyrand? Thanks.\n\nGood evening, and thank you for your questions.\n\nAs for first one, about the Chartoryski’s family - of course prince Józef knew him.\n\nFurthermore, they were a kind of relatives, because prince Jozef’s paternal grandmother, Konstancja, was born as a Czartoryska. (Which makes prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski and his siblings Pepi’s secound cousins.)\n\nPortrait of Stanisław Poniatowski and his wife Konstancja Czartoryska, Marcello Bacciarelli, circa 1766-1771\n\nMany times prince Józef visited the Czartorysku’s residence in Puławy. They most known episode, it looks like, was in 1809, when after the battle of Raszyn Poniatowski with his army went to Galicja. Though that time Puławy belonged yet to Austria, the princess Izabella and the prince Adam Kazimierz (Adam Jerzy’s parents) greeted Pepi very warmly. His soldiers were allowed to camp in the palace park…\n\nPolish soldiers, who were wounded in the battle of Sandomierz in 1809 and then treated in Puławy, leave the crutches they don’t need anymore, in Puławy’s park. An engraving made in the 19th century.\n\n… and Pepi himself participated in the opening of the Gothic house, a garden pavilion built as additional spaces for the items of princess Izabela’s collection objects related to the Polish and European history.\n\nThe Gothic house on the lithography made by Adam Lerue in 1858; and its modern photo\n\nAnd after prince Józef’s heroic death princess Izabela gathered a collection of “souvenirs” related to him and exhibited them in another park pavilion, the Temple of Sibyl.\n\n19th-century engraving of the Temple of the Sibyl, and a contemporary view.\n\nFurthermore, on the ground floor of the Temple there was places an obelisk dedicated to prince Józef:\n\nUnfortunately, this floor is open for visitors very rarely, so my photo was made through a window…\n\nAs for the youngest generation of the Chartoryskis - the closest of them to Pepi was, I think, Konstanty. He was a colonel of the Duchy of Warsaw since 1809 and accompanied prince Józef during his visit to Paris in 1811.\n\nSpeaking of the older brother, Adam Jerzy, I can recall that he was among those who tried to persuade (in correspondence) Poniatowski in 1813 to switch sides, to leave Napoleon and join Russians. (And also there was a concept named “Puławy’s plan” in 1805, about the resurrection of Poland under Russian protectorate. That time prince Adam also tried to persuade Poniatowski to join.)\n\nThen the sisters… Zofia Zamoyska, née Czartoryska, was the latest person to give a party for prince Józef on the Polish soil. And happened this in May 1813 in Kraków, just a couple of days Pepi left his motherland for good. The older sister Maria also may have been present there. (And, you know, the names of Czartoryski’s sisters also appeared in a long list of women whom prince Poniatowski was attributed to have relationship with. So I promise to return to the topic one day )))\n\nAnd now let’s move to the second of your questions, about prince Jozef’s sister’s relationship with Charles Maurice de Talleyrand.\n\nTeresa was married to the count Wincenty Tyszkiewicz in 1778, when she turned 18. He was only 4 years older than her, but he was - as diarists recall - a kind of retard. And rather eccentric. (For example, he had a habit to wear female clothes at home.) And she was bright and high spirited, liked horses, hunting etc. So she became bored of the husband very quickly, and decided to leave him.\n\nTo obtain a divorce that time was… very complicated, but still possible. But Teresa and Jozef’s uncle, the king, did not allow his niece to start the process. So the spouses Tyszkiewiczs just separated. Teresa travelled in Europe, then settled with her brother and his mistress Henriette de Vauban in Warsaw. But, in contrast with Pepi, for the next 30 almost years after the separation no one man was ever mentioned as her love interest.\n\nAnd then, with the arrival of Napoleon’s court in Warsaw there appeared French foreign minister. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand.\n\nLeft: Kazimierz Wojniakowski, the portrait of Maria Teresa Tyszkiewicz (née Poniatowski), circa 1797. Top right: François Gérard, The portrait of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand Périgord Prince de Bénévent, 1808. Bottom right: Jan Falęski, portrait of Wincenty Tyszkiewicz, 1814\n\nThat time Teresa was already more than 45 years old. And Talleyrand had seven yet more. And was married. And was… lame. (Their contemporaries jokes, that they made a strange couple - right leg lame man and one eyed woman. Because Teresa, being a teenager, lost her left eye in accident and since that time had to wear a glass one…)\n\nBut everything points that from the countess Tyszkiewicz’s side it was love, the real feeling. As for the prince of Bénévent - well, in the end of his life, when Teresa died, he lamented „the loss of his dear long-time friend” bitterly. But when everything started… she was definitely not the only one for him. (Among his love interests of that time there may be mentioned another Polish aristocrat, Izabela Sobolewska. And Anne-Charlotte-Dorothée, the Duchesse de Courlande. Who was later replaced with her daughter and namesake, who was the wife of… Talleyrand’s nephew Edmond.)\n\nBut let’s return to Teresa. When in 1807 Napoleon’s court returned to France, the countess Tyszkiewicz followed the man, who “stole her heart”. She settled in Paris, and visited Warsaw from only now and then. French diarists recall how she held small parties with card game in her house in the French capital, and always lended money for her beloved one when he was short of them. And he, though her feelings didn’t cause great enthusiasm in him, always accepted the money. (Btw, Teresa’s debts were so high, that when in 1811 Poniatowski was in Paris her creditors found him and made to pay.) But it looks like with the time passing Charles Maurice attitude to Teresa softened and he learned to value her. After she finally settled in France in 1820 they made several trips on the South of France together (though not without the company of Dorothea the younger). And the countess Tyszkiewicz even “acquired” her own room in Valençey, prince Talleyrand’s favorite residence. Where, by the way, both she (in 1834) and he (4 years later) are buried, just one near another.\n\nAnd finally the answer to the question what was Pepi’s opinion on this relationship. Did he know about it? I think that yes. Because it was not a secret in that time’s high society. Did he disapprove? It looks like no. Because, for instance, when he came to Paris in 1811, the big reception on the occasion of his arrival was made, with Teresa’s help, in Talleyrand’s house. And the prince of Bénévent was among those (together with Murat etc) who introduced Poniatowski to Parisian high society."
