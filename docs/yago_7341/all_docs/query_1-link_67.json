Situated in the heart of the continent, between the Carpathian Mountains and the Baltic Sea, between Germany and Russia, Poland came under the influence in the course of ten centuries of all the major migrations, conflicts and crucial economic and social changes experienced by Europe since the Middle Ages. There were times when Poland was a power of continental dimen- sions. There were times also when she disappeared from the political map of the world. She enjoyed on occasion great esteem in world opinion but she also sank at times into utter oblivion. Today Poland is the fifth country in Europe in size and the sixth in population. She is a member of the group of socialist countries which is associated with the Soviet Union by ties of alliance and friendship, but maintains lively economic and cultural relations also with nations of the West. From being an agricultural country, exporting grain, timber, and later coal to the more prosperous communities of the West, Poland is now transforming herself into an industrial country and an equal partner with them in international trade. The land of Copernicus, Chopin and Maria Sklodowska-Curie, of Kosciuszko and Mickiewicz is still contributing its share to common achievements of human thought and creative art. At different times, according to the current political climate of opinion, Poland’s historical role was variously defined as that of the “bulwark of 21 1000-1800 I.

Poland’s rich and varied past cannot be inter- preted and described by any one facile formula. In the course of history, every European country has experienced vicissitudes of fortune. Yet in this part of the world there is probably no country which can claim to have undergone such an erratic development as Poland. The fully developed Polish State appeared upon the stage of history in the second half of the tenth century. Dominion over the Vistula and Odra valleys was exercised with a firm hand by a hereditary ruler, asserting his sovereignty and taking part successfully in critical political struggles with the Empire, Rome, Kiev and Byzantium. The first mon- archy in Poland did not survive long. In the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries we find in Polish territories a score of contending petty duchies, harrased by Tartar raids, threatened by the expansionist policies of German lords marcher and by the peaceful infiltration of German settlers, both burghers and peasants. In spite of parcellization and weakness Poland’s cultural development nevertheless followed the west European model. Settlements spread throughout the country and urban life flourished. The country experi- enced moreover the growth of constitutional institutions normal in the Middle Ages. Parcellization, however, was succeeded by a fresh consolida- tion when the last rulers of the Piast dynasty reunited Poland at the dawn of the fourteenth century. Although only a landlocked state pushed back from the Odra river and cut off from the Baltic Sea, Poland nevertheless had vigorous life of her own and was capable of defending her independence. A political union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania concluded at the close of the fourteenth century, suddenly extended the frontiers of the Jagiellonian monarchy to the sources of the Dnieper and to the shores of the Black Sea. In this way the country became one of the major powers of Europe. Poland absorbed the learning of the Renaissance and became a wealthy and brilliant community, a granary of Europe and cradle of scholarship providing patronage to artists and a haven of refuge for thinkers who suffered persecution elsewhere. This golden age of Poland’s history was followed by a period of decline. In modern times the development of central Europe followed a course different from that of the leading countries of the West. Polish 24 INTRODUCTION wheat was shipped to the Low Countries and England while Poland imported industrial products from western Europe. The balance of trade was always unfavourable to the east European States, a fact which had repercussions on the development of the economy in the peculiar growth of demesne fanning and the so-called “second serfdom”. The carefree and hospitable life of the Polish gentry was accompanied by a decline in the crafts, the stagnation of the towns and the oppression of the peasants. The overwhelming political superiority of the gentry over the townsmen and the peasants destroyed the basis for the rise of an absolute monarchy in Poland. At the close of the sixteenth century the Polish Commonwealth could proudly point to its parliamentary system, to the toleration, equality and freedom enjoyed by the gentry. In the following century however the Commonwealth was transformed into an oligarchy of magnates with a feeble parliament and an adminis- tration reduced to impotence. The country, with a wide area open to attack on all sides and torn internally by the uprisings of Ukrainian peasants, was destined to fall victim to the greed of its powerful neigh- bours. Too late, in the second half of the eighteenth century, Poland began to rise out of the intellectual, economic and political sloth. It was nevertheless precisely her achievements in the field of administration and military reforms which induced Russia, Prussia and Austria to destroy the state which might become an obstacle to their expansion. There was indeed another paradox. Having lost their own state owing to centuries of misgovernment, the Polish people were to fight with undaunted resolve for the restoration of independence, appealing to the conscience of Europe by their military endeavours, playing upon the antagonisms of rival powers and establishing alliances with the European revolutionary movements. Superficially it appeared that all these efforts were of no avail. One insurrection after another ended in defeat until finally after 1864 nothing was heard of the Polish cause in Europe. The whole of eastern Europe and with it Poland in fact witnessed the destruc- tion of the last vestiges of feudalism and experienced an industrial revolution. As consequence of the transformation induced by the capi- talist era, the population of Poland more than doubled itself in the second half of the nineteenth century. National consciousness, moreover, reached the mass of the population even in areas like Upper Silesia 25 I INTRODUCTION and Pomerania which seemed near to being completely Germanized. When the three partitioning Powers were brought to defeat and ruin by the First World War, the Polish people was ready and capable of demanding a state of its own. This awakening of dormant nationalism may be seen in many other European countries in the nineteenth century. Unlike the Czechs and Hungarians and even more unlike the Balkan peoples, Poland had existed as a state up to the close of the eighteenth century and the advent of industrialization. Consequently, Poland had not lost her aristocracy and gentry, but on the contrary had even assimilated the upper classes in the Lithuania and parts of the Ukraine. The society which lost its independence at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a century of growing national awareness, retained still a social structure and a political tradition inherited from the epoch of self-government. This explains the exceptional dynamism of Polish national struggle and the fact that it was regarded by the leaders of European revolutionary movements at a disruptive element within the Holy Alliance. This fact also explains many peculiar characteristics in the political life of Poland’s more recent history. It was the poorer, declassed section of the gentry that fought for independence up to 1863. This element was to transmit its ideals and traditions to the Polish intelligentsia, a large proportion of whom came from the gentry. Here are the sources of the particular role played by the radical representatives of the intelligentsia at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was they who stimulat- ed the growth of workers’ and peasants’ movements, though unable to identify themselves entirely with them. This political tradition explains the high-minded ambition of the Polish intelligentsia apparent in the years between the two world wars, their aspiration to play the part of rulers and leaders of the nation. Those singular characteristics which have emerged in the political and social upheaval of the post-war years, and which distinguish Poland from other People’s Democracies, may perhaps be traced to this same source. Only to a certain degree was the course of Poland’s history determined by her geographical position and her role in Europe’s development. Like the rest of the continent, Poland lived through the Middle Ages, participated in the Renaissance and the age of Enlightenment and 26 INTRODUCTION experienced the consequences of the industrial revolution. Uncommon with the countries of central and eastern Europe, however, Poland began to suffer, by the eighteenth century, the consequences of an economy which was retarded by comparison with that of the western European countries. In this broad frame of reference this history seeks to analyse the salient features of Polish historical development in both the decline of the Commonwealth and in the national revival after the loss of independence. At home and abroad widely differing views of the Polish nation’s characteristics have been held. Poland “the Christ of nations” and “the conscience of the world”, Poland ruined by misgovernment and incapable of throwing off her anarchy, these are the widely disparate judgments. Rejecting these concepts many historians of recent years veer towards an opposite extreme in refusing to admit that Polish history has claims to singular characteristics of its own and in detecting in it only the reflections of universal processes. The truth lies somewhere between these two points of view. Account ought to be taken both of the European character of Poland’s history and of her specific and peculiar contribution to the history of Europe. This short history aims at examining the course of these two themes as they run through Poland’s past. MEDIEVAL POLAND by Aleksander Gieysztor CHAPTER I Before the Rise of the Polish State SLAVIC ANTIQUITY Mention of Poland and the Poles first appears at the close of the tenth century in the pages of foreign chroniclers who had obtained more exact information about this people. This single fact, however, cannot serve as a point of departure for an examination of the evolution of the Poles or Poland. At this early date the names as well as the ideas which these terms represented reveal a centuries-old heritage which remained in constant evidence through the Middle Ages and into the present. The Polish language, the most significant cultural phenomenon in Poland’s history, began to emerge in a remote antiquity. Other features of a geographic, historic and ethnographic nature also hark back to the period before the rise of the Polish State. Most probably, a pronounced language division occurred among the Slavs in the last centuries B.c. The two large groups which emerged from this division were the West Slavs, who occupied an area north of the Carpathian and Sudetes Mountains and east of the Odra river, and the East Slavs whose settlements spread east of Volhynia up to the middle Dnieper. There was an affinity between the material cultures and the social systems of the early Slavs. The language differences between the two groups were the result of geographic conditions, namely a large expanse of area in which it was impossible to maintain one uniform language despite of the common ethnic background designated by the old native term Slavs. However, the principal factor was the different historic evolution of each of these groups. Their individual histories were af- 31 BEFORE THE RISE OF THE POLISH STATE fected by the cultural and political conditions of neighbouring peoples, some of whom were integrated with the Slavs and exerted varying influences on the Slav culture. The West Slavs emerged in the first centuries b.c. in an area occupied earlier by an older stratum of Indo-European inhabitants, from whom they most probably took the name Wends (Veneti). The subject under consideration is the ethnic affiliation of the people of what the archeo- logists call the Lusatian culture. Though it belonged probably to an earlier ethnic stratum than the Slavs, the Lusatian culture was never- theless absorbed completely by them. The peoples of the Lusatian culture occupied virtually the whole of contemporary Poland and reached far to the west and south west beyond the present Polish frontiers. The long centuries of peaceful development, from about 1300 to 400 B.c., years untroubled, it seems, by alien incursions, pro- moted a considerable uniformity in the features of the material culture. From these days and up through the Middle Ages and on, the cultural thread in our country remained unbroken, which can be seen in the features of the timber buildings, the settlements and their anthropological substratum. It may be assumed that the Lusatian culture played an important part in the formation of the West Slav culture. It has been possible to study the cultural achievements of this people in the large fortified settlement of about 400 B.c. which has been exca- vated at Biskupin in the Bydgoszcz voivodship. The principal features were: primitive fanning methods and animal husbandry, a high skill in carpentry and pottery, and the use of iron to forge weapons and some of the tools. A considerable section of the Biskupin settlement has been uncovered on a lake island. The old settlement comprised about 100 houses of the same size lining eleven parallel streets all ending in one street that inscribed a surrounding oval line. A 15 to 19 foot high powerful wooden rampart and a structure that broke the floes and the force of the waves, surrounded the settlement. A large gate opened on the bridge that joined the island with the mainland. It may be as- sumed that fortified settlements of this type were the seat of the wealthier patriarchal families who protected their growing wealth from greedy neighbours. The genesis of the West Slavs may be traced to the modification of 32 Sl^za mountain. Woman with Fish. SLAVIC ANTIQUITY this Lusatian culture under the influence of the Slavs. It is no accident that this change coincided with economic changes, related on the one hand to the development of iron metallurgy — with the ore mined locally from the second and first centuries b.c. — and on the other to improvements in agriculture. It seems that the proximity of federations of Celtic tribes helped the ancient Slavs adopt a number of technical innovations. In the late fourth and the early third century b.c. the Celts reached across the lands on the Danube and the territory of Bohemia as far as Silesia where they established a settled community in the region of the Sl^za mountain. The magnificent sculptures ascribed to them which are scattered on the slopes and at the foot of the mount would indicate that this was their chief centre of worship, inherited later by other peoples. Another settlement was established in Upper Silesia while Celtic influence also extended as far as western Little Poland. The assumption is that the tribal name of the Lugii may refer to those Celtic groups. Other scholars, however, place them among Slavic tribes. THE SLAVIC WENDS AND THE GERMANS ON THE FRINGE OF ROMAN INFLUENCE Starting with Herodotus (fifth century B.c.) the Slavic peoples were recorded by geographers in the Mediterranean basin under a variety of names. More definitive remarks pertaining especially to the West Slavs appear in the first and second centuries a.d. The later chroniclers speak of the Wends who lived on the Baltic seacoast west of the Vistula, east of the Sudetes Mountains and north of the Carpathians, occupying an area that extended to the river Dnieper. Close study of the records left by Roman writers has led to the conclusion that the Wends are Slavic in character. Approximately at the beginning of the Christian Era, these peoples were threatened by the pressure of Germanic tribes who in a period of political activity invaded and settled for varying length of time various parts of the Wend lands. Among these Germanic peoples were the Goths who in the first decades 3 33 BEFORE THE RISE OF THE POUSH STATE of the Christian Era came to Pomerania from Scandinavia. They re- mained in a part of Gdansk -Pomerania until the third century and established trade between the lower Vistula and the Moravian Gate and the Klodzko Pass. The name of the Lugii was eventually extended to include all Celtic, Germanic and Slavic tribes which, no matter what their origins, lived in this area. At first the federation of the Lugii showed good will toward the Markomanns (a Germanic tribe) but at the end of the first century concluded an alliance against them with the Roman Empire. The Burgundians, originally from Bornholm and other Scandinavian countries, lived at that time on the lower reaches of the Odra only to continue soon their Odyssey towards the west and the south. The Gepidae lived at the mouth of the Vistula. Larger German groups departed from the territories of the Slavic Wends between the second and fourth centuries and moved closer to the Roman frontier. Thus about 250 the Goths reached the Black Sea. Soon after the Gepidae followed them bringing others in their wake. It may be accepted that in the fourth century the Slavic Wends become again the sole masters of the Polish territories. In the first centuries A. d. the Wends occupied some regions of these original territories side by side with other peoples although they remained the sole inhabitants of the major section of these lands. This period marked also a broad social and economic transformation of the Wends. Written record contain little information about this. Much more can be gleaned from abundant archeological evidence which indicates that the Polish territories were on the fringes of the influence of Mediterranean culture. When the Romans crushed the Celtic power in Gaul and in the Alpine countries, they opened trade routes to the north and east of Europe, to lands inhabited by German and Slavic peoples whose elders purchased Roman goods imported from the imperial provinces of the Rheinland, Gaul and the Danube valley. One may conclude that some of these communities knew how to set aside means for the purchase of such luxuries as glassware, vessels which bore the stamp of far-off producers (terra sigillata), amphorae filled with wine and bronze and silver vessels. Some of the graves of that period, called the “princes’ graves”, contain an astonishing wealth of objects. Valuable Roman imports, bronze 34 ON THE FRINGE OF ROMAN INFLUENCE vessels, silver goblets, dice and stones used in games and statuettes of Hellenic and Roman gods indicate, that the chiefs adopted a style of life which imitated that of the upper classes in Roman provincial society. The less opulent though more numerous graves of the warriors indicate that members of wealthier families maintained a personal relationship with the leaders. The luxury trade route from the countries of the Roman Empire ran from the direction of the Rheinland and Aquileia through the Polish territories to the Baltic seaboard. Pliny the Elder wrote of the amber trade which attracted a wealthy Roman trader, who in the days of Nero set out for the Baltic from the Danubian Carnuntum near Vienna. He made such large purchases of amber that the whole Roman amphitheatre could be adorned with it. He was one of the first Romans to explore the trading conditions and routes of this region. However, it seems that go-between agents played the dominant part in this trade. They carried skins, furs, honey, wax, some slaves and, above all, amber to frontier trade outposts in the Roman provinces. Impressive quantities of amber, called “the gold of the north”, were exported to the south, especially in the second century a.d. One of the stores discovered at Partynice near Wroclaw contained three tons of this valuable material. Roman silver coins made their appearance in the Slavic lands, and were in abundance in the second century, but became increasingly rare from the third century on. News of distant lands lying north of the Carpathians reached the Mediterranean writers through the traders. Thus in the middle of the second century, Claudius Ptolemy, the Alexandrian geographer, placed on his map the first place name in the Polish territories. Ptolemy’s Ka- lisia, identified with present day Kalisz on the Prosna river, lay on the amber route. In the southern Polish territories the crafts, practiced in an earlier period to satisfy domestic needs, were taken over later by specialists in some branches of production in certain regions of the territory. The development of iron smelting was based on turf ores mined in strip pits and partly, as in Swi^tokrzyskie Mountains, on mined red iron ore or haematite. From the third to the fifth centuries, after the departure of the Germanic tribes who did not engage in smelting, other important 3 * 35 BEFORE THE RISE OF THE POLISH STATE smelting centres operated in an area near Cracow where fifteen centuries later there was to be built one of the most powerful metallurgical com- bines in the country, known as Nowa Huta. A great many primitive smelting furnaces were discovered and studied at the time when Nowa Huta was built. It is assumed that the iron produced here was exported south beyond the Carpathians. The family community which continued as the basic unit of the social structure was undergoing diversification. Owing to the contact between the Slavic Wends and the martial Celtic and Germanic groups, certain families became engaged in fighting and looting, other in trading or even perhaps in the organization of industrial production on quite a large scale. The system employed in the production of pottery near Cracow in the first centuries a.d., has been compared with that of the Pannonian workshops which employed slave labour. However, these phenomena were neither permanent nor prevalent. From all the activities of these leading families, the Polish territories were still a land of free farmers and cattle breeders who lived on self- sufficient farms. As among all the Slavs, so here too, land was held in common. This organization was based on the principle of military aid and agricultural cooperation among neighbours. The common use of pastures and forests was widespread, though families tilled their own land individually. The existing farm tools enabled some leading families to work continuously the same strips of land. However, new areas of settlement were usually brought under the ard by the majority of farmers by the more primitive burnbeat method of cultivation. A noticeable rise in the number of settlements signified a growth in the population. Archeologists and historians put the hypothetical density of population in the second century a.d., in the area which corresponds to that of present-day Poland, at about 1.2 to 2 persons per square kilometer, or roughly a population of about 375,000. The distribution of the settlements and the concentration of Roman imports would indicate several territories which correspond to the later regional divisions of Medieval Poland. Several groups seemed to have gained considerable importance in the first centuries a.d. They settled in the vicinity of Wroclaw, Cracow and Sandomierz. This may have been the beginning of an important political organization in southern 36 ON THE FRINGE OF ROMAN INFLUENCE Poland, each of which embraced several tribes. In the plains of central Poland, the more significant groups of this type were settled around Poznan, Kruszwica, t^czyca and Plock. Similar communities were known in Pomerania and in the Baltic region of Pruthenia (Prussia) and Sudovia (Jacwiez). It is not known whether this phenomenon carried the seed of the rise of states on a regional scale. Notwithstanding their political activity, it would seem that these groups never advanced beyond the stage of tribal federations and that the twilight of the Ancient world engulfed in its descending shadows the Polish lands as well, retarding the formation of social classes by a few centuries. SLAVIC MIGRATIONS AND THE AGE OF CRISES (THE FIFTH TO THE SEVENTH CENTURIES The tribal federations of Slavs were at the peak of their prosperity in the third and fourth centuries. This fact enabled large groups of Slavs to spill beyond their native area between the Odra and the Vistula and the upper Dniester and middle Dnieper. Warrior leaders of the tribal federations of Slavs stood at the head of these expeditions which turned, especially in the fifth and sixth centuries, into migrations of large sections of the population. The economic, social and political reasons behind the Slavic migrations are not entirely clear. At any rate, it seems that the Polish lands were experiencing a period of a comparative population growth, because large groups of settlers issued from these regions and, as early as the fifth century, moved south to Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, areas which were completely absorbed by the Slavs. In the course of the fifth and sixth centuries they moved westwards to the area between the Odra and the Elbe which for many centuries hence was to be occupied by Slavs, who by their language and customs were most closely related to the Poles. Conclusive evidence is available regarding the original Veleti settlements in the Polish territories, especially in Pomerania, before this people moved west to the Odra. The Serbs lived here before they 37 2. Migrations of Slavic tribes, 5th-7th cent. SLAVIC MIGRATION AND THE AGE OF CRISES moved into the Lusatian area, and south to the Danubian lands. The Obodrits lived on the Odra before they moved to the lower Elbe. The Croats probably inhabited the upper Vistula before they moved off in different directions; their main body was carried to the Sava river. In the age of Slavic migrations, some of these names denoted only enterprising groups of warriors led by princes. The Slavic population subjugated by them in the Balkans came from the great East Slavic language family. In contrast with the impressive German march across the lands of the Roman Empire and its peripheries, the main feature of Slavic settlers was the complete mastery of the occupied areas by planting settlements and by affecting a permanent slavification, embracing not only the mass of incoming Slavs, but also other ethnic groups which assimilated the Slavic language. This expansion was facilitated by the economic, social and political cataclysm that struck the Roman Empire, and by the migrations of other barbarians across its territories. The westwards thrusts of the Huns set off a chain reaction. Numerous German tribes surged in the direction of the Roman Empire and at the end of the fourth century the Slavic peoples moved into the Danubian lands which were left vacant by the departing Germans and Roman garrisons. It is supposed that in the second quarter of the fifth century during the rule of Attila, the peoples which lived in the Polish territories were subdued by Huns. The signs may be read in the archeological finds of southern Poland. The graves discovered in Jakuszowice southwest of Cracow have yielded a bow embossed with gold, a symbol of authority among the Huns. Teophylaktos Simokattes, a Byzantine historian, wrote (book VI, chapters 2-4) that at the close of the sixth century an Avar Chagan (khan) sought the aid of Slav chieftains who lived on the Baltic and sent gifts to them. Their strength must have been considerable if the formidable Avars appealed to them for military and political aid against the Byzantines. In 562-567 the Avars probably not without the cooperation of some Slavic tribes, assaulted the Merovingian King- dom, launching the attack from southern Poland, which may have been under the control of the Avar empire in one way or another. Whatever the dependency it must have been rather loose, for archeology 39 BEFORE THE RISE OF THE POLISH STATE provides very little evidence of the presence of Avars north of the Car- pathians. The Polish word olbrzym, which means giant, may have come from the name of the Avars in the same manner, as the old French term ogre may be traced to the Hungarian invasions of the tenth century. No outline shall be given here of the Slavic migrations to the Balkans, particularly in the sixth and seventh centuries, where the East Slavs displayed a greater vigour in establishing their settlements. It is sufficient to say that this period witnessed a regrouping of the Slav peoples. In addition to the East and West Slavs there now emerged a third group, the South Slavs. The main role in the creation of this group was played by the East Slavic elements though not without an admixture of certain West Slavic elements. Later a further diversification made itself felt among West Slavs, in the form of a split into the Southwest Slavs, the ancestors of the later Czechs and Slovaks, and into the Northwest group, comprised of the Polish and Polabian Slavs. The material culture of the inhabitants of Poland declined on account of the emigration of large groups of the Slavic population — west beyond the Odra and up to the Elbe, and south across the Sudetes and the Carpathians, and owing to the severance of trade ties with the now depopulated Roman provinces. There was a pronounced slump in the living standards of the tribal elders as trade with distant lands deterio- rated. The descendants of the elders depended more on domestic products than on loot from distant lands and on external trade. This reversion to primitive culture affected chiefly the leading families. It was, however, not quite as catastrophic as in the case of the downfall of the Roman grandeur and the ruin of its high intellectual culture. The Slavic population which continued to live in rural conditions and whose demands or means of satisfying them were not exorbitant, may have breathed more freely when great potteries and metallurgical workshops, which were in no way integrated with their peaceful and easy-going life on territories held in common, were abandoned or destroyed following the nomadic invasions. The subsequent years did not bring peace. The Roman model was replaced by others. Most significant, however, was the development and expansion of the heritage of the by-gone epoch, that is the cultivation 40 SLAVIC MIGRATION AND AGE OF CRISES of soil and stock-breeding. Extensive burnbeat cultivation was still prevalent. It led to great mobility of settlement and internal colonization. Although intensive farming with the use of the ard was still limited yet it was common enough in southern Poland as early as the fourth and fifth centuries, as is borne out by the discovery of ploughshares. As the migrations of German tribes and nomads came to a halt, the seventh century ushered in a steady economic expansion which, though modest at first, bore promise of qualitative growth. Meanwhile, the Slavic peoples in the Polish territories were still organized into territorial tribes living under a democratic system. Byzantine observers reported that all problems whether favourable or not were discussed by the Slavs at assemblies attended by all the people. Here differences among the leaders were brought to light. The assemblies appointed princes whose authority was limited, because the general assembly had the power to vote for or against war and to make grants to the chosen ruler. In this type of society, conservative as all groups with little internal stratification, there were, however, the seeds of cultural change. Economic progress required time, but the impatience of certain sections of the community speeded development. The impetus came from the narrow group of lords who were eager to turn their influence to profit by the division of labour, the concentration of political power, and an exten- sion of territorial organization. With the dawn of the new age the proto-Polish tribes and peoples stood on a similar culture level to the other Slavic, Baltic and Scandinavian peoples. Their entry into medieval civilization still required a considerable re-structuring of all aspects of their social life. CHAPTER H The Origins of Poland ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF POLAND IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES Research of the last several years has established the fact that Poland and Polish nationality did not emerge suddenly in the middle of the tenth century, nor did they spring full grown from the head of Mieszko I, son of Siemomyst, the first Polish duke better known owing to written records and by and large an excellent ruler. The origin of Poland is spread over several centuries. The statesmen of that period remain anonymous. Their activity is but vaguely known while events and details are submerged in oblivion. The period of Poland’s origins in these centuries is marked mainly by the daily effort of the people who changed the features of history by clearing primeval forests for arable land, by building settlements and homes and by their concern to transmit to their successors the growing material, social and spiritual heritage. The period of emergence from obscurity, from the end of the Slavic migrations in the seventh century to the rise of a Polish State in the tenth century, was remarkable for events of special significance and long lasting effects. The foundations of a new and diverse medieval society following the course of feudal evolution and the development of Polish ethnic traits as distinct from the Slavic family as a whole and the West Slavs in particular, may already be perceived. Modern research has enabled closer study to be made of the economic founda- tions of the changes that occurred concurrently on many levels of human activity. The general progress noted in agriculture and stockbreeding before the formation of the State, was a factor in overcoming the social and 42 ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF POLAND political crisis, which marked the Slavic migrations. In the early Middle Ages social organizations again began to gain control over their natural surroundings in order to increase the yield of the soil. By the clearing of trees and burning of the brushwoods, human settlements cut deep swaths into the forests, and with the use of the iron ploughshares the lands around the settlements could be cultivated intensively. Grain crops, especially important in view of the growing population, seem to have been produced in larger quantities between the seventh and tenth cen- turies, a time when the major parts of the Slavic lands adopted the ard and abandoned, except in remote or outlying settlements, the older and more primitive methods of agriculture. The soil was the chief source of wealth in the Polish land. Its pro- ductivity was related directly to the improvement of farming imple- ments. The lighter soil of Great Poland, Pomerania and Mazovia w'ere easy to plough. When ploughshares w'ere armed with iron dur- ing the late period of Roman influence, it was possible to till the heavy and fertile soil of Silesia and Little Poland. The prevalence of the ard and the sickle must have effected changes in the quality of Polish agri- culture as early as the tenth century. The pursuit of agriculture and cattle farming gave the landscape of early Poland an appearance of uniform husbandry. There were regional differences of lesser impor- tance, resulting from the abundance of wild life or bees’ nests in the forests, or from an abundance of fresh water fish. The chief mineral mined in this period was bog iron ore which was found virtually in all Polish territories. In many parts of Poland iron smelting was con- ducted most probably as a seasonal occupation secondary to farming. Salt was extracted from salt springs by evaporation, principally at Kolobrzeg in Western Pomerania, in the Kujawy region, near Cracow and in other local salt springs. Skills in various crafts spread gradually. Having survived the critical period between the fifth and seventh cen- turies, such crafts as pottery and metallurgy revived under the in- fluence of new stimuli. Domestic products still fell far short of the luxury handicraft imported from near and distant countries to satisfy the needs of the leading social groups. As the upper ranks of society established their position on the new economic foundations, the severed or tenuous trade ties with other 43 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND countries were reestablished. Though not numerous, the archeological sites of the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries indicate that the eco- nomy of the Slavic, proto-Polish and Baltic tribal federations, though they still bore the traits of a primitive, natural economy conducted within settled groups, nevertheless had contacts with the external world. The trade of this period involved a small number of goods which were especially attractive to the ruling group. The most important items were weapons which domestic producers could not supply in sufficient quality and number; next came luxury goods, such as gold and other ornaments. It is known, although this informations pertains to other Slavic countries, that horses were used in the barter trade. One of the frontier posts through which goods from and to the West had to pass was Magdeburg on the Elbe, designated by Charle- magne’s decree as one of the places to which Frankish merchants, chiefly Jews, could come to trade with the Slavs. In the ninth and tenth centuries, the items exported were principally furs and slaves despatched usually from Mainz, the emporium from which the goods were carried to Gaul, northern Italy and even Islamic Spain, where Slavic slaves were highly valued. In southern Germany, Ratisbona (Regensburg) was an important market centre of a far-flung trade. Trade with Rus (Russia) was established at an early date. One of the routes between Russia and central and western Europe ran through Poland as early as the ninth century. The route led from Kiev to Cracow and thence through Bohemia and Bavaria. Imports from the Mora- vian metallurgy were also known in Polish territories. Sea commerce on the Baltic with the distant Frisian and the closer Scandinavian ports gains in vigour in the course of the ninth century. Wulfstan, the voyager and informant of King Alfred of Wessex, sailed at the close of the tenth century from Haithabu (Hedeby) at the base of the Jutland peninsula and down the Slavic coast eastwards to the market settlement of Truso-Druzno, an active buying and selling centre lying in the Vistula delta in the Slav-Prussian border area, not far from present lake Druzno and Elblqg. It may be inferred from written evidences supported by archeolo- gical data that in the early Middle Ages the forest frontiers between the lands of the Balts and the Slavs were crossed by both sides. In 44 ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF POLAND addition to the sea and coastal routes from the mouth of the Vistula to Sambia, renowned for her amber, the roads between the settlements of Chehnno region and the borders of Pomerania led deep into the Pruthenian region; an important Mazovian route joined by a southern branch from south Poland ran up the Narew towards Sudovia, a region situated between Poland, Russia, Lithuania and Pruthenia, which was for many centuries a neuralgic cross-road of economic and political interests in this part of eastern Europe. THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF REGIONAL STATES The early medieval trade expanded concurrently with the organiza- tion of the larger states which were capable of insuring a steady supply of the raw material sought by foreign merchants. The materials were collected from the tributes exacted from the population by their rulers. The rulers also guaranteed a supply of slaves, principally, though not exclusively, war hostages. In the Polish territories, as among the neighbouring peoples, this trade satisfied the demands of the higher social classes w'hich cut them- selves off from the territorial rights of common. These people accu- mulated more of arable land and more cattle because they worked their farms with slave labour made up of war captives and native serfs. As the accumulated movable wealth was inherited, the lords had a greater opportunity for conducting wars, for pursuing political in- terest and for leading the free population. Representatives of this group stood at the head of larger territorial federations and compelled the population to make free gifts and imposed tributes for the ducal treas- ury and for their own political activity. Wars of expansion and loot were conducted by means of a standing group of warriors and also troops raised by levy in the whole of the political organization. The new type of organization was heralded by the emergence of the castle-town ( grod , castrum), a fortified settlement raised as a centre of authority by several powerful families whose political influence 45 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND extended over the surrounding still fairly small territories. The archaeolo- gical remains of these wood and earth work are studied today as evidence of Polish history. The oldest, built between the seventh and ninth cen- turies, are of two types. There are the small forts built as seats of the leaders which were known in Great Poland, Lower Silesia and also in western Mazovia. The second type are the large structures which served as a refuge for the whole population of a given area. We know, however, from Little Poland that the whole of the fortified area was not occupied permanently. Political power vested in the most powerful economic groups tended to concentrate in both types of such castle towns. The political centres began to show great vigour. This fact may be ascribed to the aspirations of lords who, in the struggle with their rivals and with the population from whom they exacted tribute, created the military and financial foundations of the state structure. Among the Slavs and the Balts the political struggle for power took place most likely at the general assemblies of freemen called the wiec. Here the antagonisms between the interests of the freemen and the ambitions of the notables and between the rival tendencies of individual notables, came to light. Actually, policies of war and peace were re- solved by the assembly’s body of aldermen drawn from among the notables, who also chose or deposed their leader, the duke (Polish kngdz, later ksiqdz and ksiqzg, latin dux). The dukes were originally and for a long time only military com- manders, but they strove to increase their wealth and to secure office for life. Later they tried to make this honour hereditary also. The suc- cess of their endeavor depended on what interest could be excited among the notables in external expansion. Among the Polish and Russian Slavs, this expansion led to concentration of political power in the course of the ninth and tenth centuries. Among the Balts, this power did not cross the low threshold of territorial and castle-town districts until the emergence of the Lithuanian State in the thirteenth century, their expansion having been checked by powerful Polish and Russian neighbours. In the early Middle Ages, the duke led a small group of warriors which the Slavs called a druzyna. This institution was indispensable to the success of authority, though the warrior group alone did not 46 THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF REGIONAL STATES constitute a state. The state emerged from a struggle waged by the duke, the notables and the warriors on the one hand, against the free members of territorial communes on the other, upon whom they sought to impose heavy burdens to support the treasury and to defray military costs. The enactment of tribute and gifts signified that a machinery of the State was in operation. The ruling groups had a share in the income of the treasury and by this fact identified their interests with the policies of the highest authority, working to strengthen its position internally and externally. Noteworthy are the factors which secured an uneasy balance in this antagonistic social structure. One of these, and not the least important, was the fact that the free population still constituted the overwhelming majority in the expansive and defensive enterprises undertaken by the political organization, which also offered a chance of development for many of the inhabitants. They were still integrated by a common faith and belief, a common language and culture, a fluidity between the social groups and the way of life of individual groups of the population. A record written in the eastern part of the Carolingian Empire, most probably immediately after 843, and called the Bavarian Geo- grapher (Descriptio civitatum ad orientalem plagam Danubii), gives an account of the organization of Slavic and Baltic political associa- tions of the ninth century. Several other ninth and tenth century texts fill in the picture and disperse the mists of anonymity surrounding certain phenomena, which at this date had a long history of evolu- tion. Although not completely, informants of the Carolingian officials knew comparatively a great deal about the nearest neighbours of the Frankish State; but less about the territorial organizations that lay on the trade routes to the east and very little indeed about the politi- cal institutions of the lands of the Slavs and the Balts in the remoter areas. What were the oldest Polish territorial organizations? In Silesia we find at least five territorial organizations: the Dzia- doszanie (Dadodesani), Bobrzanie, Sl?zanie (Sleenzani), Opolanie (Opolini) and Gol^szyce (Golensizi). A large group of the Polanie (Polanes) inhabited all of central Poland. Some scholars hold that the 47 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND term Polanes was preceded by Ledzice (Lendizi) and that this term was extended from central Poland to embrace various other regions as far as the Russian boundary, where the Poles were known as Lachy; they were called by the Baltic peoples the Lenkai and by the Magyars (Hungarians) the Lengyel. It is probable, however that the term Ledzice was first applied to the south-eastern strip of proto-Polish lands on the forefield of Sandomierz. Written evidence reveals two smaller regions, one of the Wolinianie (Velunzani) and the Pyrzyczanie (Pris- sani) and of other smaller groups whose names have become extinct. Another large regional group known as the Vislanes (Wislanie) lived in southern Poland on the upper Vistula and its tributaries. Virtually nothing is known of the rest of the Polish lands and of their organization. The geographic extent of these groups mentioned above is often an object of scholarly controversy. It is possible to de- termine the territorial delimitations, bounds with permanent settle- ment, by the names which these large and small organizations carried, but only in rare instance did the names survive a greater length of time. This is an eloquent evidence of the political ferment in which the peoples who bore these names lived. Unrecorded battles and in- vasions, attempts to consolidate large areas and their subsequent dis- integration, was most likely the content of their political history. Two major centres proved capable of survival. One of these formed around Cracow, the capital of the small State of the Vislanes, and the second rose around Gniezno, the capital of the Polanes. In the second half of the ninth century the Moravian neighbours considered the Vislanes “very powerful” for having opposed the po- litical expansion and the attempts at conversion to Christianity that came from Moravia. However, this opposition ended in disaster for the duke of the Vislanes and his lands were incorporated into the Mo- ravian State. The Life of Methodius, an apostle of Moravia, gives an account written by a contemporary : “The pagan duke, very power- ful among the Vislanes, defied the Christians and caused them harm. Methodius sent to him and said ‘My son, it would be well for you to accept baptism of your own free will in your own land, for other- wise, taken captive you will be forced to accept Christianity in a foreign land. Remember my words!’ And so it came to pass”. 48 THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF REGIONAL STATES Despite its favourable geographical situation and a swifter, it would seem, economic development, southern Poland could no longer fulfil the role of being the nucleus of a growing State, owing to the pres- sure of more powerful neighbours to the south, Moravia and Bohemia, and later to the influence of the Polanes to the north. THE ORIGINS OF THE POLANES The Polanes inhabited a territory on the middle Warta. Their ex- pansion was most fruitful in political consequences. The term Polanes — Polanie is undoubtedly derived from the Slavic pole, the word for field. This testifies to the agricultural nature of settlement in an area under permanent cultivation, though surrounded and cut up by for- ests. Very little is known as yet about the earliest history of this po- litical federation. The large expanse of territory inhabited by the Po- lanes in the tenth century would indicate that their conquests must have begun at least in the middle of the ninth century. The duke, who ruled in Gniezno, succeeded in uniting in a state of considerable scope the smaller territories around such castle-towns as Poznan, Kruszwica, Lqd and Kalisz and to set it on a course of continued territorial ex- pansion. Recent archaeological excavations have yielded tangible evidence about the castle-town of Gniezno, which the written records name as the capital of the Polish duke in the tenth century. This well fortified town was founded between the eighth and the ninth centuries and expanded later several times. The names of the dynasty to which Mieszko I belonged are known. The name itself testifies to the fact that the ruling house was of native origin. Mieszko I succeeded to a throne upon which not a few predecessors had sat: his father Sie- momyst, his grandfather Leszek (also Lestek or Lestko) and great grandfather Siemowit preceded by yet another duke, called Chosciszko, a person who cannot be identified with the legendary Piast. There is a vague tradition that this dynasty ascended the throne by an act of violence committed most probably in the second half of the ninth 4 49 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND century. Medieval history created the legend that the dynasty was founded by Piast, a peasant of the Duke Popiel from the preceding dynasty. Modem history of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries bestowed upon the ruling house the dynastic name of Piast, although in the Middle Ages these rulers called themselves “the family of Polish dukes”. The shaping of the Polish State started a hundred year earlier, if not more, than about the year 963 when Mieszko I led Poland onto the stage of European history. Mieszko I and his predecessors ex- pressed the interests of the small group of lords who surrounded them. The organization of a strong Polish State accorded not only with the goals and interests of the centre of authority with its seat at Gniezno and not only did it protect the population from foreign invasion, but also insured a distinct ethnic and cultural evolution to the native ele- ments. The bell of history had sounded a knell for the West Slavs. The fact that the German State had frustrated the political development of the Polabian Slavs, led eventually to their loss of independence and to their gradual, but final disappearance from the map of Europe. After 955, following the twin victory of Otto I over the Hungarians and the Slavs, the Polanes brushed against the mounting influence of a large power that was rising in the west. The leaders of the Polanes showed considerable political sense at this hour of birth of their State. The prospects awaiting them were clearly extremely attractive unlike those offered to the small Polabian or Pruthenian States. It was incumbent upon them to meet the chal- lenge of history. The prospects were of expansion which promised to strengthen the central organization of the State, which was the re- pository of every type of revenue, loot and prisoners. One of the con- sequences in the evolution of an expansive political organization was the early emergence among the Polanes of the authority of a hereditary duke. However, this did not preclude the fact that the lords had to give their approval to the manner in which the title was transferred to the descendents. A large area was united in the course of the ninth and tenth cen- turies. It embraced, even before the reign of Mieszko I, a wide ex- panse of plain, and therefore all of central Poland, the later Great 50 THE ORIGINS OF THE POLANES Poland, the lands of tgczyca and Sieradz and all of Mazovia. It is quite probable that at this early date the Polanes had already reached across the Land of Chelmno for suzerainty over Gdansk-Pomerania, which was conveniently connected with central Poland by the course of the lower Vistula and roads alongside both its well populated banks. Apart from this loosely-connected territorial group there was still the northern zone of the lake and coastal countries of Western Pome- rania ruled by various dukes and local lords, and the uplands of Silesia and Little Poland, embraced by Bohemian influence. Most of these territories were drawn together by their similar social evolution. Physiographic links between the basins of the Odra and the Vistula, as well as the cultural, ethnical and language similarities, were conducive to unification. These factors were very important to the cohesion of early medieval States, although their architects did not always take them into account, trying instead with varying suc- cess to extend their rule beyond the related ethnic groups. THE SPIRITUAL AND MENTAL CULTURE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A COMMON STATE What common cultural heritage could attract to each other the population of the Polish territories in the tenth century? It is not easy to distinguish the features inherited from earlier development and flowering of the Slav community, from the changes introduced when the new political system began to emerge. A most notable feature of the beliefs held by the Slavic peoples is the subservient role of their pagan religions to the needs of the agri- cultural population. They worshipped fire and the sun, a mysterious power to the people of that age which gave them the means of liveli- hood, warmth and a good harvest, but one that could show its anger by causing drought, by hurling lightning bolts and wreaking fire. They worshipped the life giving properties of the mother earth. A few relics that survive in folk customs would indicate that, there was worship of water, of the springs, rivers and lakes, though this was not as im- 4 * 51 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND portant among the pagan Slavs. Mythical creatures were invoked in forests under trees of venerable age or of unusual appearance, and in enclosures designated as sacred groves. Here the people worshipped. Here auguries were made and large sacrificial feasts were held with gifts from the first fruits to insure a good harvest for the year. The most important cult, however, was sun worship, which must have come down from a very remote past as evidenced by the fact, that the chief god of sun and fire was known by the common name of Swarog — Swarozyc to many of the Slav peoples. According to ninth century Arabic accounts about the harvest rites practised by the Slavs, a handful of grain was cast upwards to the sky to propitiate the gods. Until the late Middle Ages, the Polish nobility took the oath by rais- ing the hand to the sun, and until quite recently the Polish peasant greeted the rising sun with a special prayer or bow. Inherited from the ancient times, this cult of the gods and of the phenomena of nature was practised on a family or local scale. The sacrifices were made by the head of the family or by one of the elders in behalf of the community. There were soothsayers who told fortunes and cast spells, who turned back evil and foretold good luck and who also acted as medicine-men. There is reason to believe, that as the new society emerged in the Polish lands, attempts were made to extend the scope of some cults and to invest them with political meaning, or at any rate, to bind them to the centre of authority. Among the Polabian Slavs this was accom- plished by evolving more elaborate sacrificial rites and by establishing special servants around the personification of the chief god. There are traces of a similar effort in the Polish territories. We know that the Sl?za — Sobotka mountain, whose lone peak looms in the middle of the fertile plain of Lower Silesia was a centre of a pagan cult at the close of the tenth century. “It was greatly honoured by all inhabitants”, wrote Thietmar Bishop of Merseburg (lib. VII, c. 59), “owing to its hugeness and purpose, for magic rites were performed here.” Archae- ological evidence of a ninth century cult centre was discovered on the summit of Mount Lysiec, later called Swi^ty Krzyz (Holy Cross) in the central Polish massif. This va;a 1.5 kilometres (about a mile) long stone wall that surrounded the summit of that mount. 52 THE SPITIRUAL CULTURE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A COMMON STATE The people had stone images and wooden gods. The heads of some of the oak statues have come down to our times. A bearded and mous- tached head of a natural size (22.5 cm together with the neck) carved in oak with a sure hand was found on a lake island at Jankowo, south- east of Gniezno. The hole at the base of the neck was made for fixing the head on a figure or post. Another head was discovered in the basin of the upper Warta, thereby offering tangible proof of the Old Russian chronicles’ story of the eradication of pagan cults, by casting the images into the water. Several large roughly carved stones have been pre- served in central and northern Poland. They are anthropomorphic in character as may be seen by the three images on the rock of Lezno in Gdansk-Pomerania. The Life of St. Adalbert charged that the Slavs worshipped stone and wood instead of god (Vita, I c. 1). The people worshipped their ancestors by invoking the ghosts of the forefathers. There was a gradual change in the funeral ritual. Owing to the influence that came from the south, from the Christian area of Moravia, cremation was abandoned and the bodies of the dead were buried. The victory of Christianity accelerated this process of change which, however, was completed only as late as in the twelfth century. The Mazovian custom of surrounding and covering the body with rocks has remained to this day as a trace of local beliefs. Although little is known of the cult and the rites, there is reliable evidence furnished by folklore and ample illustration provided by later day medieval records, regarding the various kinds of magic spells and taboos, which the Christian clergy combated for many centuries. The general level of intelectual ideas may be assessed by means of linguistic data, and especially the vocabulary, and from the abundant ethnographic evidence common to all the Slavs. On this basis it may be accepted that prior to the ninth and tenth centuries, when new and intensive intellectual and cultural contacts were established with the outside world, all the Slavic peoples, including those in the Polish territories, had a considerably diversified vocabulary. They had words not only to describe ideas relating to concrete objects used in their daily life, to the material culture and technical knowledge and to infor- mation about nature, but also words designating quite elaborate abstract 53 THE ORIGINS OF POLAND ideas, which would testify to a knowledge of the basic phenomena of abstract thought. The Slavs were broken up into language groups and began to evolve internally along different lines at an early period. The language group that settled the valleys of the Vistula and the Odra was uniform for genetic reasons because for centuries, at least from about 500 B.c., it had lived on the same territories, which may be regarded as the cradle of the Slavs. The vernacular spoken in these lands began to differ in the early Middle Ages from that spoken by the neighbours to the west, the Polabian and Czech Slavs, although the precise chronology of this event is a controversial matter. Archaeological excavations offer a better view of various aspects of culture among the earliest Poles. The modest finds provide evidence of an art that was as little differentiated as the society of the early Middle Ages. The need for monuments found expression in the mounds of earth raised as tribute to a great leader, or duke of the regional political organization. Few of the mounds have survived to our times. The most prominent height is the mound, called the tumulus of Krakus, which looms above Cracow on the right bank of the Vistula, a work of the seventh century, which is an impressive technical achievement of a society in which the territorial communities of free farmers were still a dominant feature. The mound is about 17 m (56 feet) high with a diameter of about 61 m (200 feet) and a volume of 16,000 cubic metres (571,000 cubic feet). Art handicrafts, metal objects, especially weapons and ornaments, were imported from the Rheinland, Scandinavia, the land of the Avars and Moravia. By the early ninth century, Arabic silver coins and objects made by Oriental silversmiths, were brought in by way of the Baltic. Before the middle of the tenth century, the Slavic countries on the Baltic organized their own handicraft industries, imitating the Arabic filigree work, to satisfy the growing demands of their native lords. From Russia there were the weaver’s shuttles made of pink Volhy- nian slate and glazed baby rattles. Pottery used in daily life which appear in great abundance in ex- cavations from before the tenth century represent a definitely native trend in ornamentation. The simple though varied decorative themes 54 THE SPIRITUAL CULTURE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A COMMON STATE could be executed under primitive conditions of production, and it seems highly probable that they were performed by women as a home craft. On the vessels from northern Poland the grouping of all kinds of lines, zigzags, herring bone design and arcs exhausted the decora- tive possibilities. We may assume that the geometric design was strongly entrenched and had a long history here. In southern Poland the de- signs were arranged in stripes. This pattern may have resulted from the fact that the pots, or parts of them, were shaped on a potter’s wheel. This technique spread across the whole of Polish territory by the tenth century, and the making of pottery became a trade performed by men, who worked in shops that were attached to the castle-towns. Although the level of the Slavic civilization cannot compare even with the reduced and barbarized heritage of the Mediterranean cul- ture, and even less with Oriental culture, yet it did not differ from the culture of other Scandinavian and Baltic peoples, who were new members of the large family of European races. The Slavic civilization was based on many centuries of native achievement which survived and defined their distinct character through the ages and to the present day. From earliest times, the Polish people participated in the heritage of the general Slavic traits and made contributions distinctly their own. Only later, after the acceptance of Christianity, did they establish cooperation with the more distant German and Latin neighbours, and also with the closer neighbours, Russia and Hungary. CHAPTER HI The Early Years of the Polish State THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATE AND THE BAPTISM OF POLAND IN 966 The second half of the tenth century marked the consolidation of the State machinery placing it on firm territorial foundations. Al- though the Polish State arose from the former state of the Polanes, there are reasons to view the political organization ruled by that ener- getic Duke Mieszko to be in many respects a novel achievement, effected during a turbulent transition to a higher form of organization. Ibrahim ibn-Yaqub, a Jewish traveller from distant Spain, wrote in 966 that the country of Mieszko, the King of the North, was the most extensive of the four known Slav states (the Obodrits — in present day Mecklen- burg; the Bohemians; the Bulgars; and the Poles). According to his report, the Polish State had an elaborate fiscal system, with tribute paid to the ducal court which performed the function of the country’s central administration. Tribute was used to pay the rank and file of the knights living in the environs of the castle-towns and to maintain a standing and battle seasoned squad ( druzyna ). Archaeological data reveal that at least a score of castle-towns were rebuilt in the second half of the tenth century or built afresh on new foundations, and that there were important changes in the re-distribu- tion of the castle-towns to locations that suited the needs of a more extensive State. The network of administrative, fiscal, defense and judiciary organs extended to all parts, of the land and united the com- ponents into one whole, which was governed personally by the duke and a circle of lords associated with him. The towns enjoyed the ser- vices of the peasant population which was compelled to pay tribute 56 THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATE and to render services for the benefit of the lords of the castle town and their garrisons of knights. Almost all these garrisons, whether deep in country or on its borders, were protected by a network of obstacles and fortifications in their approaches. Traces of these con- structions remain in contemporary place names such as Zawady (Ob- stacle), Slupie (Post), Stroze (Guards) and others. The organization of the administration must also have led to the fixing of State bound- aries by the annexation of small peripheral territories which, though independent, nevertheless vacillated in their fealty between one more powerful neighbour and another. Mieszko’s personal ability is evident in his initiative and energetic military and diplomatic activity. His vision embraced Europe from Rome to Kiev and from Hungary to Scandinavia. Owing to his great talent he could successfully undertake to carry out tasks which were also supported by his lords. The first task was to buttress the internal structure of a State organization constructed with admirable ingenuity, and then to extend the State’s administration over territories which were gravitating towards the Polish State by ethnical kinship, indis- pensable to a Polish State if it was to emerge safe, and sound from the competition with the states of central and east Europe, which were also consolidating their power in the tenth century. The second of these tasks was completed in the last few years of Mieszko’s rule, from 989 to 992. The frontiers of the State were extended to the Baltic coast, from the mouth of the Odra to the mouth of the Vistula, and included all of southern Poland from the western boundaries of Silesia to the upper reaches of the Wieprz river. The success may be ascribed to the pronounced internal cohesion in which a major role was played by the consolidation of the apparatus of authority further strengthened by the acceptance of Christianity in 966. The consequences of Christianization extended to all aspects of life, though not to all at one and the same time. The introduction of Christianity by the court was in the first place a political act. The con- version of the country was a necessity to the group which was building a powerful new State. Not only in Poland but also in other Slavic and in Scandinavian societies this group was alive to the fact, that a new system of beliefs and views was necessary to consolidate the group 57 THE EARLY YEARS OF THE POLISH STATE itself, and at the same time to exert an influence on the whole of so- ciety at large, in order to integrate it with the new State organization. Not without reason did the local Pruthenian leader of the opposition to the Polish mission of Bishop Wojciech (Adalbert) fear the alien Christian law under the cover of which the Poles sought to expand their power over their northern neighbours. In the same manner, the tribal duke, in the borderland town of Sudovia preferred to trust his own gods when he welcomed Brunon of Querfurt. There was no elaborate hierarchical system in the pagan religion of the Poles. Slavic rulers, who sought to reinforce their new States with a system of ideas, tried occassionally to reorganize and centralize the pagan religions. Tribal beliefs were organized and firmly implanted, as was the case in Kiev, before the Christian religion was ultimately accepted. Elsewhere the hierarchy of the priests of the chief god was raisen in status, examples of which may be found among the Polabian Slavs and in Pomerania. At that time Pomerania reverted to pagan beliefs and cast off Polish suzerainty. The most advantageous and effective solution of both the internal and the external political pres- sures exerted by the neighbouring Christian countries upon the pagans was to accept Christianity while independence was maintained. This course was followed in the late eighth century by the Slovene and Croat dukes, in the ninth century by the Bulgarian, Moravian, Bohemian and Serb dukes, in the tenth century again by the Bohemian as well as by the Russian and Hungarian dukes ; in the north by the Scandinavians. The Christian Church gave its sanction to the new social structure, lent support to and extended the authority of the duke. It provided models of organization and people well equipped to conduct corre- spondence and maintain international relations as well as to carry on the internal administration. The Church threw the gates wide open to the cultural heritage of the ancient world and to the achievements of the early Middle Ages by introducing writing, that basic tool of culture, and by establishing contact with more highly developed cen- tres of culture, education and art. The political conditions attendant upon Poland’s conversion were advantageous to the country. Nothing is known of any kind of foreign pressure to christianize Poland. It is clear, however, that the decision 58 THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATE to accept Christianity was made in order to strengthen her position with regard to the two Catholic neighbours in the west, Germany and Bohemia. Hence, this decision was justifiable as a measure of political expediency and to insure Poland equal rights in the international rela- tions. The choice between the Eastern and Western Church was de- termined by Poland’s proximity to countries that professed the Roman Catholic faith and by the close political ties with Catholic Bohemia. Embers of the Slavic rites, surviving from the Moravian State, still flickered in Bohemia, but the Court and the Church of Bohemia had close ties with the Church organization of Bavaria. There is no con- clusive evidence available that the Slavic rite survived the Moravian period in Cracow or that it had been implanted here in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The baptism of the Polish duke and his courtiers occurred in 966 in an agreement with the Bohemian Premyslids, a dynasty which had a year earlier provided Mieszko with a wife named Dobrava. Em- peror Otto I declared his support and confirmed the appointment of the first Polish bishop. The first mission, comprised of churchmen from the Holy Roman Empire, was headed by Bishop Jordan who, it is presumed, came from lower Lorraine, perhaps from Liege or from Italy. Bishop Jordan assumed the government of an embryonic Church organization. There may have been only one diocese extending over the whole of Mieszko ’s State and directly subordinated to the Apostolic See. The Polish mission’s independence of the German Church must be regarded as evidence of the political perspicacity of the Polish ruler as well as the testimony of his advantageous position in relation to Otto I who needed the Polish duke’s support in his struggle with the more powerful State of the Veleti that lay west of the Odra river. The Christian name of Lambert, which recurs in the ducal family (carried by Prince Lambert, son of Mieszko I, and by his grandson. King Mieszko II Lambert) was the name of the patron saint of the cathedral of Liege. Other western influences noted in the earliest Polish clergy came from Ratisbona (Regensburg) and Augsburg. Mieszko I was known to worship the grave of St. Udalrich at Augsburg. Although the Church organization of Poland subsequently reverted to the model established by the Holy Roman Empire, it was never- 59 THE EARLY YEARS OF THE POLISH STATE theless Bohemia, then still without a bishop of her own, which first helped the Poles adopt the Church terminology through the agency of her clergy and contacts between the Bohemian abbeys and the ear- liest Church of Poland. In consequence the terminology of the Polish Church is derived from that of Bohemia, Moravia and indirectly of Bavaria. It ought to be remembered that for many years before this, Christianity had exerted an influence on Little Poland, which was not governed by Mieszko I, preparing the ground for the conversion of his country. The Moravian mission which came to the land of the Vislanes at the close of the ninth century did not find the political conditions favourable to its aims, and there is reason to doubt whether the faint traces of a cult of the Moravian saints found in southern Poland can be connected with the mission of Methodius. On the other hand, the Bohemian mission of the tenth century did achieve its aim. For a time the Church of Prague maintained Bohemian influence north of the Carpathians. POLISH BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED IN THE ODRA AND VISTULA BASINS The Polish-Bohemian alliance helped Mieszko I adopt certain ele- ments of State organization which opened the door to foreign cultural influence. In the political sense this alliance covered Mieszko’s south- ern flank during his campaign to conquer Western Pomerania. The country at the mouth of the Odra played an extremely important role in the economy of the ninth and tenth centuries, and the Baltic littoral with some of its ports, such as Wolin and Szczecin on the southern coast, became a powerful factor in the extensive commerce through the northern Russian lands and to the Arab East. Large amounts of silver extant among the great many treasuries of Pomerania, Great Poland and Mazovia came this way from the Near East. In the tenth century, Poland entered the orbit of world commerce and politics via the Baltic. In the course of several decades, Mieszko tried to establish himself on the Baltic seabord from the mouth of the Odra as far as 60 POLISH BOUNDARIES IN THE ODRA AND VISTULA BASINS Pruthenia. For a number of reasons Western Pomerania became the most alluring prize. About 963 Mieszko I, rex Misaca as the Saxon chronicler Widukind called him, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Veleti who, living beyond the Odra, also reached out for the whole area at its mouth. Trying to safeguard his position with regard to the Holy Roman Em- pire by paying tribute for the contested territory, Mieszko arrived at the mouth of the Odra in 967. In 972, he defended his prize by de- feating Margrave Hodo, who had been greatly disquieted by Mieszko’s progress, at Cedynia at the confluence of the Warta and the Odra. In 979 Mieszko successfully repulsed a German expedition led by Otto II and soon established relations with the regency which ruled the Em- pire. The Polish State held its boundary on the Baltic and the Odra and also established political relations with Scandinavia. Evidence of these ties is established by the marriage of the daughter of Mieszko I, Swiqtostawa, identified by historians as Sigrid Storrada, first to Eric Segersaller, King of Sweden and Denmark, and then to Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark. She is known as the mother of Canute the Great. Under Mieszko Poland’s main problems came down to matters that were of vital importance to the Polish plains, in short establishing access to the Pomeranian ports and participating in the goods and metal exchange of that time. Apart from the ties with the Bohemians Mieszko allied himself with the Holy Roman Empire to fight the com- mon foe, the federation of the Veleti. This agreement proved valuable when the Poles parted company with Bohemia. The territory of the Polish State was finally rounded off in the war with Bohemia for Silesia and Cracow, which in 989-992 Mieszko in- corporated into his dominions. The order and chronology in which these lands were conquered is still a subject of controversy. The latest historical and archaeological data point to the difference and to the high level of the economy and culture of the Polish highlands. In- corporated in the Piast dominions they immediately began to play a prominent role and drew the country into political problems re- sulting from the proximity of Bohemia, Hungary and Russia. Mieszko I took it upon himself to perpetuate his acquisitions in the south and in the north by strengthening the Church. It is likely 61 THE EARLY YEARS OF THE POLISH STATE that he had hoped to achieve what was ultimately accomplished by his son, that is to set up a Church metropolis and a Polish archbishop who was to crown the future sovereigns of Poland."
