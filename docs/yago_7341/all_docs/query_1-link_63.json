This old house from Flanders moved to Brandeburgia in 1250, where they released the Albertus Rufus territory called Fleming on the Elbe, where some of them multiplied in Thuringia and others in Pomerania. Of these, Tham Fleming had two sons around 1295. One of them is called Curd, the other Erdman, one the Fleming line, de Bocken, the other de Martentin. Among them was Jakub Marshal von Pomerania, whose two sons: Jerzy Kasper, advisor to Kurfirszt Brandeburgski, who fathered three sons from Ostenovna: Joachim, Friedrich General, his wife de Watzdorfen, Jakub Henryk, horse of the Lithuanian field marshal of the Saxon army, Knight St. Jana, wife of his first Lithuanian Franciszek Sapieżanka, but the marriage ended in divorce. The second princess, Radziwiłł, Chancellor of Lithuania, however, had no descendants after him and Bogusław Bodon, a lieutenant general whose wife was de Wrechen and their children. The second son of Jakub Heino, Henryk, in the army of Sask and Brandeburg, Field Marshal, left with Elżbieta de Phulen four sons and two daughters: Elżbieta Marianna, Jan Przebendowski, Grand Treasurer of the Crown, the second of General Schak's wife, and sons : Jan Jerzy, Count Fleming, Major General of the Lithuanian Army and Artillery, then Treasurer of the great Lithuanian, whose wife Katarzyna de Segris de Bielken, whose family were the two Swedish queens.\n\nEquestrian Fleming Lit. Minister Augusta II came down childless. Two sons followed him. Of these, the younger one, who settled in Saxony, was initially the emperor's envoy from Saxony, [p. 43], then Minister of the Cabinet Saski. From Lubomirska, swordfish crowns. He left offspring of these daughters, the daughter was given to Przebendowski, sons also left some: this minister was the starost of Gniewski, who had this royal land from her father-in-law.\n\nJerzy, the older brother of the minister, was first general and chief of a guard regiment, then a great Lithuanian treasurer. He died in 1772. Governor of Pomerania, he was also Starost von Brzeski, Szadowski, Szereszowski, a man of great skill in the economy, and he came to immense fortunes, an honest industry and bought his inheritance to Pociej with debts, and left him back in an elite state. These properties are mainly located in the Brzesko Litewski Voivodeship, from Pociejów Włodowa, Rożanka, Terespol, Rzeczyca from Sapiehas successors to Chancellor Lit. with many neighborhoods. He also had Berckloo County in Holland, estimated to be more than two million. During the greatest conflict between Czartoryskie and Radziwiłł, he was once marshal at the Lithuanian tribunal. He had Princess Czartoryska, the daughter of Chancellor Lit, behind him. after his death, after the Roman dispensation, he married a second daughter. He left a daughter of his first wife, Izabela, the only heir to his immense wealth, which Adam, Prince Czartoryski, understood. - Krasicki.\n\nWielądek in the heraldry, as well as Niesiecki above, gave him Jan Jerzy, Treasurer Lit. Katarzyna de Segris and daughter Izabela later followed Czartoryski, who then wrote in the Czartoryski genealogy that this Flemish treasurer was the daughter of Fryderyk Michał Ks. Czartoryski and after her second full sister who supported Krasicki after her death. So I think Jerzy had three wives, and of the first was de Segris Izabela née Fleming, Duchess Czartoryska, who, after leaving two daughters, was Marianna after Prince Ludwik Wirtemberski, Zofia after the ordained from Zamojski (died 1838) and the sons of two Adam and Konstanty from the universal grief of all those who revere their exemplary family and their civic virtues, after having experienced great political changes in their beloved homeland, had great influence and influence on their families, she died in 1835. -\n\nFleming coat of arms (vol. 4 p. 42)\n\nFlemish coat of arms .

He also preserved the coat of arms of three lilies from his father's narymund, which was affixed to the pillars and pogoń, modeled on other Lithuanian princes, various coats of arms according to their preferences, as is clear from the testimony of Stryjkowski. Fern. and okay. Narymund first transformed Hippocentaur into Pogoń, Gedrojc into Róż, Donmant into a bison head, Gedymin conquered the city of the three pillars, Corybut after the hunt, first an eagle, then a month with crosses, the princes of Rozyń took crosses from a tree trunks hanging, others, even before the unification of Lithuania and Poland, either added coats of arms to the old aristocratic symbols or, after neglecting their own, began to use new ones.

By this heroic spirit, glorified by his deeds as the Swedes and Moscow, who swore by this kingdom, wanted to tear it apart, and almost all lowered their hands to its downfall, but watched with tears, a rare one who had his hand in arms, the army and the Lithuanian knighthood with the royal consensus, this Paweł chosen as his hetman and it made no mistake in his opinion, because first he gave Horus from the Moscow commander the first field in Brest; where I like skinny people with a handful of eighteen thousand who, with the help of St. Faustina, the martyr, the patroness of this occasion, put it down; He drove the Swedes out of Lublin; He first besieged Warsaw with them and kept their momentum until the camp's royal army was strengthened. Where the same Paweł will open the field of a Swede to victory with energetic attack, wise advice and bravery, albeit strengthened by Brandenburg's meals, and a leg would not have escaped had he not broken his leg after stumbling after the enemy Paul . In this case, the enemy understood that he would long be pleased to withdraw from the field of the royal camp, but he was wrong; for Paul, who had brought the army to first order and glory as if he had been conscious himself in a battle, he ruined him considerably for his hostile orderly in Prostki when he freed him from the camp and made a path for yourself to further victory.

After so many victories, it is unheard of for Paul to take a long hiatus, but reconsidered when the army turned to Moscow via Jerzy Dolhoruki, who was pondering deeper Lithuania, and closed reinforcements from Moscow for those who came after Miedniki: he forced the reins of the Moscow camp to flee. He snatched Minsko from the hands of the enemy.
