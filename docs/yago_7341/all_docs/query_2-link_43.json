        "text": "Source: \"Ave\" [The weekly magazine of the Radom diocese] no. 40 (119) p. 13, 14\n\nauthor: Fr. Stanislaw Makarewicz\n\nFrom the Old Records (113) - Kazimierz Pulaski was born in Warsaw\n\nThis sensational information is contained in two records which note the supplementary ceremonies that completed the baptism of two brothers at the Church of the Holy Cross: Kazimierz and Franciszek Pulaski, which took place on 14 March 1745. Both records are in the book of baptisms \"Liber Baptizatorum ad. a 1744 d. 22 Janu. ad. a. 1751 d. Julii indusive,\" and are on the left side of card 29. The records are in order, one after the other, on a page that is 9 by 32 centimeters, or in a book of the then most commonly used format known as a \"dutka.\" The page of record is confirmed by a seal with a rectangular frame (4 by 1 cm.) made with black ink containing the words: X.M.NARUSZEWICZ\n\nDZIE:WAR:.\n\nThe Latin text of the record tells us: \"14 March 1745. I, Krzysztof Faltz a priest of the Society of the Missionary Fathers, am completing the ceremony of the child of the lawful parents , the illustrious Jozef Pulaski the Warka starosta and Marianna his wife, by me on the day of 6 of this (month and year) baptized. Names: Kazimierz Michal Wladyslaw Wiktor. The witnesses of this ceremony were: the Illustrious Stanislaw Poniatowski, voivode of Mazowsze and the Illustrious (Maria Zofia) Princess Sieniawska Czartoryska, the daughter of the Ruthenian voivode. Second set: Kazimierz Rudzinski, the Czersk castellan and the illustrious Eleanora Princess Czartoryska, wife of the vice-chancellor of the Great Lithuanian Principality and others.\"\n\nThe record below it states: \"I, same as above, at this time have completed the ceremony for a child of the above parents, that was baptized not quite a month ago at the parish church in Grabow. Name: Franciszek Piotr August Stanislaw; The witnesses of the ceremony were: the illustrious August Alexander Prince Czartoryski, the Ruthenian voivode with the illustrious Maria Antonina Rudzinska, daughter of the Czersk castellan. Also: the illustrious Michal Prince Czartoryski, vice-chancellor of the Great Lithuanian Principality and the illustrious Konstancja Poniatowska nee Czartoryska, wife of the Mazowsze voivode and others.\"\n\nFrom the content of these records it appears that the events took place as follows: 4 March 1745 was the day of birth for Kazimierz Pulaski (probably he \"chose\" the name by being born on the feastday of St. Casimr); on 6 March 1745 he was baptized \"by water\" by Fr. Krzysztof Faltz CM (the actual baptism); on 14th of March 1745 the supplementary ceremonies took place. It was the celebration of the baptism and gathered the illustrious godparents and witnesses of the baptism.\n\nIt is characteristic that the supplementary ceremonies were carried out for both sons of Jozef and Marianna Pulaski, for the newly born Kazimierz and Franciszek, who was born earlier (1743?), but who was baptized at last in February 1745 at the church in Grabow. The earlier baptism of Franciszek could be considered as an anticipatory act\n\nbefore the completion of the ceremonies of baptism in Warsaw. No doubt they awaited the arrival of Kazimierz in Warsaw at the apartment of the Pulaskis which was in the Palace of Prince Czartoryski. Two days after his birth, Kazimierz was baptized -- as states the record -- in the capital.\n\nThe supplementary ceremony of baptism took place at the church of the Holy Cross in Warsaw. We think that because of the custom of noting in the parish records the place where the liturgical observances took place, in case these took place outside the church. That is why in some records we find the additional notes in Latin: \"at the church of the Visiting Sisters,\" \"at the church of the Carmelite Fathers,\" \"in the Palace of the Prince Czartoryski,\" \"at the chapel of the Princes Radziwill,\" at the chapel of the Princes Poniatowski,\" \" at the palace of the Lubomirski Princes,\" \"in the Czapski Palace,\" etc. Neither of the two records has this information.\n\nBiographical notes most often gave the date of birth for Kazimierz Pulaski as 1747. The record which was used as a source by the author of the \"Pulaski, Kazimierz\" entry of the Polish Biographical Dictionary (vol. XXIX/3, 1986 p. 386-395) gives the date of 4 March 1746. This \"record\" is at the Regional Museum in Warka. Unfortunately it is a falsification. This \"document\" has no authenticity, and not only are its outward appearances false, so are its contents. The \"record\" does not contain the date of the child's baptism. It only gives the date of birth as 4 March 1746. But church records note, above all, the date of the liturgical event, that is the date of baptism. This falsification also is not written according to the standard formula. Instead of \"Ego idem super\" it should read \"Ego idem ut supra.\" In the \"record\" there is no name given for the father of the child (!) which is an extraordinary omission, especially when this was the ceremonious baptism for the child of a nobleman. The third name of the child has been twisted about. The \"record\" from Warka has it written as Waclaw (Venceslaum), but it should be Wladyslaw (Vladislaum). Such a document could not have been created by a priest of that time, and probably not a modern one either.\n\nIt must be observed that the \"record\" from Warka is written on a page that contains other records, but each has a different year. Is it possible that in that parish there was only one child born per year? And then not every year?\n\nWarka is the family seat of the Pulaskis and fully deserves to be treated as such. After all, most likely at the manor in Winiary, Kazimierz Pulaski made an oath to be true to the ideals of the Bar Confederation, and then left for Lwow with his father. In the year 1771 he defended Czestochowa from the Jasna Gora monastery \"for law and fatherland, for the Faith and the [Blessed Virgin] Mary,\" protecting the territories of Rawa, Radom, Czersk and Warka -- his family lands.\n\nIt is too bad that we missed the 250th anniversary of the birth of this extremely popular and beloved citizen of Poland and the United States.\n\nReturn to Menu"
