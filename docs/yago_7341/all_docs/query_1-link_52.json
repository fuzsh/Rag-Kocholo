        "text": "The author presents the finds of amphorae of the Roman time, which were found on the island of Berezan. Materials that are introduced into scientific circulation are stored in the depositaries of the Odesa Archaeological Museum of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. They are mainly represented by fragments of amphorae, which were found as a result of the work of archaeological expeditions headed by M.F. Boltenko (1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1946) and V.V. Lapin (1960, 1961) at Berezan settlement. Some of the finds also came from the island of Berezan, but the year and place of their finding are unknown. A comprehensive study of amphorae fragments gives the opportunity to reconstruct the trade relations of the settlement, which was located on the island of Berezan in the first centuries AD. Products in transport amphorae appeared on the island in the early Roman time. Thus, in amphorae of type Vnukov S І, dating no later than the first third of the 2nd century AD, Heraclean wine, made according to Coan recipe, was imported. Subsequently, the products of Heraclea Pontica sporadically came in amphorae of variant Vnukov S IVC. The peak of trade activity of the settlement was attained in the end of the 2nd – the middle of the 3rd century AD. The range of products imported in transport wares during that period was rather wide. Heraclean wine was imported in large quantities (in amphorae of variant Vnukov S IVD) as opposed to much lesser quantities of the Aegean wine (in vessels of type Kapitän II) and Cilicia wine (in amphora of type Agora G 199). Probably, there was wine in amphora of type Zeest 72 or Zeest 73, which came to the island from an unidentified production site. Bosporus ‘salsamentum’, which had been very popular among the inhabitants of Berezan settlement since the end of the 2nd century AD was transported in amphorae of type Zeest 75 (variants A, C, D), and from the beginning of the 3rd century AD, also in a rather rare container of type Krapivina 27 (variants ‘a’ and ‘b’). Salted fish was also imported from the non-localized center in vessels of variant Zeest 75B. In addition, a small amount of purchased olive oil was imported in amphorae of type Zeest 80 from several production sites located in the Aegean and the Black Sea regions. Single items represent variants of amphorae that cannot be correlated with already known types. In Berezan collection of the Odesa Archaeological Museum of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, no ceramic containers were found, which could be dated only later than 264. However, vessels of types Zeest 72 and Kapitän II could come to Berezan in the 4th century AD.\n\nThis overview of transport containers from the Roman fort of Apsaros (modern Gonio) in Georgia, excavated by a Polish–Georgian expedition since 2014, presents the most common forms and fabrics based on a database that includes 1243 diagnostic fragments from both the Roman and Byzantine periods. These preliminary results (the excavations are still ongoing) show that the supply of amphora-born commodities came predominantly from the eastern and southern Black Sea region, making it thus a local or regional network. Interestingly, in the 1st–3rd centuries AD, Aegean imports, probably in the form of better quality wine and olive oil for the camp command elite, were much more popular than those from the northern Black Sea region, the latter occurring only sporadically. Moreover, the West Pontic area apparently played no part in supplying Apsaros because containers produced in the territories of modern Bulgaria or Romania have not been identified so far in any of the assemblages from the site. The pattern of supply did not change considerably from the Roman to the Byzantine period, but regionalization evidently increased as indicated by the statistically insignificant number of imports from outside the Black Sea region during Late Antiquity.\n\nThis paper presents a sample of early and late Roman amphorae fragments discovered during several excavations performed at Aegyssus–Tulcea-Colnicul Hora in the 1959-1996 period, with the purpose of bringing a small contribution to the study of the economic history of the Roman Empire. The sample consists of 458 fragments. Typologically, 17 amphora types were identified, some of which have different versions: Dressel 43, Dressel 2-5, Dressel 24, Zeest 72, Zeest 94 (Šelov B and C), Berenice Middle Roman Amphora 5, Kapitän II, Agora M273, Kuzmanov XV-XVI, Spatheion, Opaiț D II, Opaiț D III, Opaiț E I – c, Carthage Late Roman Amphora 1, Carthage Late Roman Amphora 2, Carthage Late Roman Amphora 3 and Carthage Late Roman Amphora 4. Furthermore, out of these 17 types, it was determined, based on macroscopic fabric comparison, that 5 types were of Aegean origin, 3 types from the Eastern Mediteranean Coast, 7 types of Black Sea origin, one type from North Africa, while the LRA 1 and even LRA 2 types were produced in various centres in the Eastern part of the Empire. Chronologically, 5 types were distributed during the Early Roman Period, 10 types during the Late Roman Period and 2 types have been traced to the period between the 3rd and 4th century AD. Last but not least, the paper also proposes a method of calculating quantities of imported wine and olive oil during the two time periods of the Roman Empire.\n\nA general interest towards medieval amphorae from the territory of present-day Bulgaria appeared in the late 1950’s. After a 40-years gap, a short article was published in the early 2000’s dedicated to “Dark Age” amphorae. Presently, there are about a dozen almost entirely preserved 8th to 10th century transport containers and about two dozen shards. Although quite similar, the amphorae are not identical and should be set in separate types due to differences in fabric and the shaping of the lips and handles. Some greatly resemble amphorae from the Northern Black Sea coast and the Eastern Mediterranean, suggesting their potential origin, while others are quite unique. Despite difficulties concerning the exact chronology, most of the materials can be dated to the 8th-10th centuries. The amphorae discovered were clustered in two major areas – mostly around Burgas Bay on the Western Black Sea coast and along the Maritsa River, exemplifying two major lanes of distribution. All “Dark Age” amphorae were found in territories controlled by Byzantium. The distribution patterns confirm the observation that, for the period under consideration, long-distance trade was replaced by more localized and short-distance contacts, and that food supplies and commercial exchange did not cease. The main challenges of identifying “Dark Age” transport jars are due to: 1) unrecognition of amphora fragments as such; 2) inability of distinguishing “Dark Age” amphorae from the Late Roman, especially when fragmented, due to similarities in shape and fabric composition; 3) ignorance of what “Dark Age” amphorae looked like; 4) inability of defining chronology due to the lack of dating materials such as coins or other items that could be used for comparison; and 5) lack of publications or information about the existence of such material from previous excavations. Future perspectives on “Dark Age” amphorae studies include: 1) identifying possible “Dark Age” amphorae assemblages; 2) defining their typological diversity; 3) identifying plausible production centers and areas of origin through typological comparison and fabric analysis; 4) confirming/rejecting established distribution patterns; and 5) determining how these results fit into the 8th-10th century Mediterranean economy.\n\nA late Roman shipwreck located off the cape of Plaka (Crimea, Ukraine) during surveys carried two main types of amphorae, LRA1 and ‘carrot’ amphorae. The typological study lead to propose a dating of the cargo between the second quarter of the 6th and the 3rd quarter of the 7th century. Preliminary results of petrographic and chemical analyses show that the two types of amphorae do not correspond to a single production. The hypothesis that the whole cargo came from the workshops of Sinop or of Seleucia Pieria, possible providers of both types, is thus not supported. An origin in Rhosos/Arsuz might be proposed for most of the LRA1 samples, thanks to reference chemical data provided by previous research carried out by Empereur and Picon. The attribution of Plaka ‘carrot’ amphorae requests further study, and especially the analysis of comparative material from Sinop. The amphorae in the cargo are shown to have multiple origins, a feature that may be common in the late 6th - 7th centuries."
