        "text": "Polish princess (1746–1835)\n\nFor other people with the same name, see Izabela Czartoryska (disambiguation).\n\nElżbieta \"Izabela\" Dorota Czartoryska (née Flemming; 3 March 1746 – 15 July 1835) was a Polish princess, writer, art collector, and prominent figure in the Polish Enlightenment. She was the wife of Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and a member of the influential Familia political party. She is also known for having founded Poland's first museum, the Czartoryski Museum, now located in Kraków.\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nShe was the daughter of Count Georg Detlev von Flemming (Polish: Hrabia Jerzy Detloff Flemming) and Princess Antonina Czartoryska.[1]\n\nOn 18 November 1761, in Wołczyn, she married Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, thus becoming a princess.[2]\n\nShe was rumored to have had an affair with the Russian ambassador to Poland, Nikolai Vasilyevich Repnin, who was alleged to have fathered her son Adam George Czartoryski.[3]\n\nShe had also an affair with the Duke de Lauzun, who says himself in his \"Mémoires\" he fathered her second son Konstanty Adam.\n\nIn Paris in 1772, she met Benjamin Franklin, subsequently a leader of the American Revolution, and the French philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, who were bringing new ideas to the old order.\n\nIn 1775, together with her husband, Czartoryska completely transformed the Czartoryski Palace at Puławy into an intellectual and political meeting place. Her court was one of the most liberal and progressive in the Commonwealth, although some aspects of her behavior also caused scandals.[4]\n\nIzabela discovered the talent of the young painter Aleksander Orłowski and financed him.\n\nWhile in Prussia with her daughter Maria Wirtemberska for the latter's marriage, she told Frederick II of her fears that her husband would be poisoned, which was what had caused a split between him and Stanisław August Poniatowski politically. Frederick laughed and told her that only monarchs were poisoned, and spread the conversation around his court to Izabela's detriment, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa.[5]\n\nIn 1784, she joined the Patriotic Party.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising, her sons Adam George and Konstanty Adam were taken as political hostages by Russia's Empress Catherine II.\n\nIn 1796, Izabela ordered the rebuilding of the ruined palace at Puławy and began a museum. Among the first objects to be included were Turkish trophies that had been seized by Polish King John III Sobieski's forces at the 1683 Battle of Vienna. Also included were Polish royal treasures and historic Polish family heirlooms. In 1801 Izabela opened the Temple of the Sibyl, also called \"The Temple of Memory\".[6][7] It contained objects of sentimental importance pertaining to the glories and miseries of human life. During the November Uprising in 1830, the museum was closed. Izabela's son Adam George Czartoryski, going into exile in Paris, evacuated the museum's surviving objects to the Hôtel Lambert. His son Władysław Czartoryski would reopen the museum in 1878 in Kraków, where it exists today.[8]\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nMyśli różne o sposobie zakładania ogrodów (1805)\n\nPielgrzym w Dobromilu, czyli nauki wiejskie (ca. 1818)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCzartoryski Museum\n\nRoyal Casket\n\n\"Mold of the Earth\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
