        "text": "Maria Agata was born December 14, 1789 from a Samonon ben Elisz family called Szloma z Rohatych. The entire family converted to Catholicism in 1759. Her father, Francizek Wo³owski, had a brewery in Warsaw. Her mother, Barbara Lanckoroñska, was well educated. They taught her to dance, to play piano, and to speak foreign languages. After two years of lessons, her teacher, Antonin LIsowski, advised them to find her better teacher than he. So she studied for four years under Tomasz Gremm. She not only played music, she composer music, and gave organized concerts. She was also a good painter.\n\nJósef Elsner, Franciszek Lesel. Karol KurpiñskiI were among the visitors to her parent's house. When the French soldiers arrived in Warsaw, Eloy de Vice and Pierre J. Rode, pianist Daniel Steielt and opera composer Ferdynand Paér were among their guests. Her parents, seeing her talent, sent her to Paris in 1810. The director of the Paris conservatory dedicated her Fantazja for piano. After her return, on March 21, 1810, she married Jósef Szymanowsky and tried to be a good wife for 10 years, spending summers in Otwock and winters in Warsaw. At her parents' salon, she met Gasapro Spontini, Jan Ladslav Disika (a Czech pianist and composer), August Klengel, the Italian singer Angelica Katalan, and a son of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. After five years of marriage, she decided on an art career, beginning with a concert at the Vienna Congress. Tzar Alexander was enchanted and invited her to St. Petersburg. Although she was a great success, her husband and parents were not happy, especially her husband who wanted to see her in the house. So they separated. She wanted to educate her three children alone. For two years, she practiced the piano and on April 2, 1822 began playing in Moscow and June 17 in St. Petersburg. The concerts were attended by Tzar Alexander and his wife. At the end of 1822, she received the title \"First Lady Piano Player of Her Highness Tzarina Elizabeth Alexandrowna and Maria Fiodorvna\". With her sister Kazimita and her brother Stanoslaw she traveled throughout Europe. Her title opened doors for her in Warsaw, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Wilno, Kiev, Lwow, Poznan, Drezden, Wroclav, Vienna, Berlin, Genev, Pariz, Mediolan, Parma, Florence, Rome, and London. On August 5, 1823 she gave a concert in Marianske Lazne where she met Gothe, who wrote Am Madame Marie Szymanowska (Asssoechnung). She was in Berlin on December 10, 1823 and in January 1824. One of her concerts was for Fredrick William III and his court. She had concerts in London before George IV, too. She composed minuets, polonaise, mazurkas, nocturne, fantazje, etudes. In 1816 Karol Kurpiñskishe dedicated one of his work to her, as did Jan Nepomucen Hummel in 1822. She was in contact with John Field, Felix Mendelssohn, Bartholdy, Fredrick Chopin, and Michal Glinka. Polish emigrants loved her.\n\nAfter 1827, she lived in St. Petersburg, ending her public concerts in 1828. She hosted a salon where she meet Alexander Puskin, Michal Glinka, and Adam Mickiewicz, whom she helped to get a passport and who later married her younger daughter Celina. She died 25 July 1831 in St. Petersburg."
