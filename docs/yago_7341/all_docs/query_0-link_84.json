        "text": "When speaking about Fryderyk Chopin (1810- 49), we tend to think of Żelazowa Wola, where he was born, of no. 12 Place Vendôme in Paris, where he spent the last months of his life, or of the church of the Holy Cross in Warsaw, the final resting place of his heart. But the place with which Chopin perhaps had the strongest ties was the campus of the University of Warsaw – a complex of buildings located at 26/28 Krakowskie Przedmieście. Chopin lived in one of those buildings for more than ten years (1817-27), and in the years following that, until his departure for Vienna and Paris in 1830, he visited the campus almoust every day as a student of the Main School of Music, and institution that was then an integral part of the University. This book discusses those formative ten years which Chopin spent among professors and students of the University of Warsaw. The young composer witnessed the erection of new University buildings, the opening of the University Museum of Fine Arts and its art exhibitions organised every two years since 1819; through his acquaintance with artists Chopin came to appreciate the visual arts. His friendship with Delacroix, as his visits to the Dresden Gallery, the Paris exhibitions of fine arts (the Salons) and the Palais des Beaux-Arts, described in his letters to his family, all are proof of the love of painting and sculpture that Chopin developed in Warsaw during his University years.\n\nThis small publication tells about those formative ten years which Chopin spent among professors and students of the University of Warsaw. The young composer witnessed the erection of new University buildings, the opening of the University Museum of Fine Arts and its art exhibitions organised every two years since 1819; through his acquaintance with artists Chopin came to appreciate the visual arts. His friendship with Delacroix, as his visits to the Dresden Gallery, the Paris exhibitions of fine arts (the Salons) and the Palais des Beaux-Arts, described in his letters to his family, all are proof of the love of painting and sculpture that Chopin developed in Warsaw during his University years.\n\nMany volumes have already been written about the Polishness of Chopin’s music and about his influence on composers of various nationalities active in the Romantic and later periods. In this text the author looks at how Chopin was viewed by 20th-century Polish composers regarding two aspects: 1) how they interpreted his music in the context of its links to Polishness and 2) whether and how they took on his musical concepts in their own oeuvres. This will allow to shed some light on the reception and resonance (to use the terminology of Mieczysław Tomaszewski, a distinguished expert on Chopin and 20th-century Polish music) of the figure and music of Chopin in Polish music of the previous century. There will be examined an extremely patriotic public speech given by Paderewski in 1910, as well as Szymanowski’s opinions from the 1920s. Moreover, the politically driven celebrations of Chopin Year in 1949 will be recalled. The special attention will be put on the musical genres associated ...\n\nReception of Chopin and his Music in Polish Society. In spite of the fact that Chopin is regarded as the greatest Polish composer neither his life, nor his music is well known by the mass audience in Poland. The paper presents the results of empirical study on the reception of Chopin in Polish society. The collected data allowed for examination of Polish listeners’ attitudes toward Chopin and the criteria used by respondents to evaluate his music. We also try to investigate the way people perceive Chopin. The specificity of Polish culture and mass culture are the background of the explanation why there is little interest on Chopin’s works in Poland"
