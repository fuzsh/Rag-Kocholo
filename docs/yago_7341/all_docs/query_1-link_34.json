        "text": "The palace of marshal Adam Kazanowski, one of the largest residences of its kind in Warsaw during the reign of the Vasa dynasty, has also been one of the most mysterious in terms of the history of its construction, since no comprehensive architectural research has been performed on its site until the early 21st century. It was only in 2007 that a survey of the most valuable section of the now-vanished palace – its eastern wing – was performed in the course of renovation works conducted by the Warsaw Archdiocese branch of the Caritas. This article presents the results of this survey which allowed to verify various hypotheses concerning the phases of the construction of the palace as well as its original appearance, to make a more precise determination as to the chronology of the construction of its individual sections as well as to reconstruct the spatial and functional layout during the subsequent phases of its existence. The most significant conclusions include the precise determination of the area covered by the main body of the palace and the arsenal, the determination of the location of original, 17th-c. window openings as well as the discovery of the remnants which allowed to reconstruct the original layout of the main staircase – a truly unique design in its times in Warsaw architecture. Another important issue is the nature and scope of alterations of the palace complex during the times when it served as a Discalced Carmelite convent and, later on, as the seat of the Warsaw Charitable Society.\n\nLudwik Michał (1780-1835) was one of the wealthiest people in the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he used his assets wisely, multiplying them in well-planned businesses and large-scale farms: his was one of the first mechanised farms in the former Polish-Lithuanian state. Pac developed his political career in Warsaw and needed a representative seat in the capital of the Kingdom of Poland, so he purchased the Radziwiłł Palace along with a spacious property on Miodowa street. In 1824, Ludwik Michał Pac started the reconstruction, which was led by Enrico (Henryk) Marconi, the co-creator of the palace in Dowspuda. The character of the entire palace complex was a combination of classicist, neo-Renaissance and Palladian motifs, and the Pac family's palace should be regarded as one of the most important examples of palace architecture in the era of the Kingdom of Poland. The palace was erected in modern style-an opposition of neo-Gothic Dowspuda, his main seat. In the palace of Warsaw the particularly interesting was the decoration of the dining room, which is described quite enigmatically as \"the room with Pacowski buildings\" (\"sala z budowlami Pacowskimi\") in the literature.\n\nThe palace in Kukizów of King of Poland John III Sobieski is known only to a narrow group of architecture and art historians. The palace and park complex ceased to exist in the 19th century. The architecture of the palace is known especially from the descriptions in the inventory documents from the early 18th century. Although the authorship of the palace design belongs to the well-known artists of the era – Augustyn Wincenty Locci and Piotr Beber, its architecture has not yet been reconstructed. A specific feature of the royal residence in Kukizów was the construction of royal buildings and town buildings in a wooden material. The intention to create a city complex and an entirely wooden residence was a unique experiment in the field of European architecture and urban planning of the 17th century. In the paper we present the results of our research on the architecture of the palace and town for the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe paper presents the results of research carried out in the palace at Żyrowa. The introduction discusses the architecture of the palace, analyses source references to the site and identifies successive owners. The architectural research into tech- nology, building material and architectural detail, as well as iconographic studies were the basis for the considerations. They gave grounds for the identification of the oldest building that dates back to the Gothic period and of the scope of the Mannerist expansion that was carried out in 1631–44 by Count Melchior Ferdinand de Gaschin. The scope of the Baroque and new-style transformations in the early 20th century is also discussed. The summary emphasizes the uniqueness of the layout which stands out from other Silesian residences in terms of size, programme and architecture.\n\nThe article aims to investigate aristocratic collecting practices in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 19th century, focusing on three points. First, we highlight the specific situation of the Polish aristocracy compared to most European countries and note the weakness of collecting culture in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the early modern period, followed by its slow emergence at the end of the 18th century. Then, we investigate the most important phenomena of 19th-century aristocratic collecting and distinguish two major trends within it: collecting art and collecting national memorabilia. We also highlight the importance of aristocratic collections for a stateless nation. Finally, to illustrate the overview, using a specific example to underline the key issues, we discuss the collections of Princes Czartoryski. In this essay, we summarize our previous research on the collections of Polish aristocracy and provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and systematic panorama of this phenomenon."
