        "text": "Z\n\nZabel (Isabella) â (1212 â 1252)Â\n\nQueen regnant of Armenia\n\nZabel was the younger daughter of King Leo II and his third wife Sybilla, the daughter of Isabella I, Queen of Jerusalem and Amalric II of Lusignan. Her elder half-sister Stephanie was the wife of the Crusader king of Jerusalem, Jean of Brienne. Leo II designated Zabel as queen of Armenia under the regency of Adam of Baghras, betrothing her to the son of Andrew II, King of Hungary. With Leoâs death (1219) King Andrew broke off the betrothal. Adam was murdered (1221) and replaced as regent by Constantine of Lampron, who married Zabel to his own candidate, Philip, the son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch. Philip proved unpopular and refused to embrace the Armenian Church, and was eventually capture in his wifeâs rooms, imprisoned at Sis, and later poisoned (1225).\n\nThe queen fled to Seleucia, but the Knights Templar to whom she had fled for protection, and who had supported Philip, handed over the town and the queen into the hands of the regent Constantine, who then forced Zabel to marry his own son Hethoum of Lampron, the marriage uniting the two rival branches of the Armenian royal house. Though much against the marriage at first, Zabel at length relented, and the two were crowned together (1226), her husband becoming king Hethoum I. Zabelâs three daughters, SibyllaÂ (1237 â 1290), who became the wife of Bohemond VI, Prince of Antioch, Euphemia (c1240 â 1309), who married Julian Garnier, lord of Sidon (died 1275), and Maria (died after 1310), who was married to Guy of Ibelin (died after 1270) and died as a nun in the convent of Notre Dame de Tyre, in Nicosia, Cyprus.\n\nHer granddaughter, Rita of Armenia became the wife of the Byzantine emperor Michael IX Palaeologus, and adopted the Imperial name of Maria. Queen Zabel died (Jan 23, 1252) at Ked, aged thirty-nine, and was interred within the royal mausoleum at Trazarg. With her death the throne passed to Hethoum who ruled till his death (1270), when he abdicated in favour of their son Leo III (1236 â 1289).\n\nZabelia of FoixÂ Â Â Â see Â Â Â Â Foix, Zabelia de\n\nZac-Kuk â (c584 â 640)\n\nMayan queen\n\nKnown officially as the âLady Zac-Kuk,â she succeeded as ruler of the Mayan empire at Palenque (612), on the Yucatan peninsula of Central America. Her son Pacal (born 603) succeeded as king of the Maya in 615, but Queen Zac-Kuk remained the real ruler of the kingdom until her death twenty-five years later.\n\nZaeske-Fell, JohannaÂ Â Â Â see Â Â Fell, Johanna\n\nZagorka â (1873 â 1957)\n\nCroatian novelist, dramatist and intellectual\n\nBorn Maria Juric, she was forcibly married to a wealthy Hungarian but the marriage was miserable and she left him three years later.

She founded the madrassa (Islamic religious school) at Shiraz.\n\nZaida (Isabella) â (c1070 â 1107)\n\nQueen consort of Castile (1100 â 1107)\n\nZaida was probably the daughter of Abn-Alheje, king of Dania. She was married firstly to Al-Mamun, king of Seville, and then became the mistress, and fifth wife, of Alfonso VI (1040 â 1109), king of Castile (1072 â 1107). With the death of her first husband Zaida became Alfonsoâs concubine, and bore him a son Sancho Alfonsez (1096 â 1107). Alfonso married her (1100) after the death of his fourth wife, Bertha of Burgundy, making Zaida his legitimate wife and queen, and legitimating their son.\n\nZaida then took the Christian name of Isabella (Elisabeth), which would be acceptable to her Christian subjects. This fact is behind the wrongly repeated story that Alfonso was married to a French princess called Elisabeth. Queen Zaida died (Sept 12, 1107) aged about thirty-seven, and was interred in the royal Abbey of Sahagun.\n\nZaimis, Eleanor â (1915 â 1982)\n\nGreek-Anglo pharmacologist\n\nBorn Eleanor Christides, she was raised and educated in Bucharest.

Though she was appointed as assistant to the director at the Royal Hospital Charite in Berlin, her desire for promotion was frustrated at home because of her youth, and she immigrated to the USA (1853). There she studied medicine at the Cleveland Medical College in Ohio, being one of the first four women to be admitted there. She graduated as a physician in 1856.\n\nZakrzewska worked alongside Elizabeth and Emily Blackwell at their New York Infirmary for Women and Children and was later professor of obstetrics at the Boston Female Medical College, in Massachusetts. She became involved in various social causes such as providing amenities for the working poor and the abolition of slavery. She established the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston (1863) and later the New England Hospital Medical Society (1878), the first such association to be inaugrated by a woman, and served as first president.\n\nZambelli, Carlotta â (1875 â 1968)\n\nItalian ballerina\n\nZambelli was born (Nov 4, 1875) in Milan, Lombardy, and studied at La Scala, making her stage debut at the Paris Opera (1894).

Her earlier works included Ensayos poeticos (Poetic Tests) (1887), El castillo negro (The Black Castle) (1906) and Rafagas (Squalls) (1914). Two of her works were published posthumously Pereginando (Travelling) (1943) and Cuentos breves (Short Novels) (1943).\n\nZanardi-Landi, Karoline Franziska â (1882 â 1935)\n\nAustrian adventuress and memoirist\n\nBorn countess Zanardi-Landi, she claimed to have been born in France, the illegitimate daughter of the ill-fated empress, Elisabeth of Bavaria, the wife of the Austrian emperor Franz Josef, who was tragically assassinated by an Italian (1898). Countess Larish maliciously supported this fraudulent claim in her own book Secrets of A Royal House (1935).\n\nKaroline became the mother of the famous actress, Elissa Landi (1904 â 1948), who had a celebrated career in the USA. The countess was the author of several published works such as The Secret of an Empress (1914), which was published in London The Royal Outcast (1916) and Is Austria Doomed ?

Zanuck, the co-founder of Twentieth Century Fox Studios, whom she had met on a blind date. He was then a struggling screenwriter and Virginia later bore him three children.\n\nVirginia retired from films after her marriage and established herself as a prominent hostess in California. Despite her husbandâs name being often coupled with glamorous starlets the couple resided apart, but were never divorced. With her husbandâs eventual retirement (1973) they became reconciled.

She later established her own drama school in Cracow and a touring troupe in Lemberg.\n\nZapolska was best remembered for her plays, which devolved around the themes of human selfishness and sexual taboos and mocked the bourgeois classes for the shallowness and hypocrisy. Adultery is the theme of two of her works Zabusia (My Darling) (1897) and Ich czworo (The four of them) (1907). Her most admired production Moralnosc pani Dulskiej (Mrs Dulskaâs morality) (1906) dealt with the hypocrisy of double moral standards. Her novels included Sezenowa mitosc (Seasonal Romance) (1905), Kaska Kariatyda (Kaska the caryatid) (1888) and Oczym sie nie mowi (What is not spoken of) (1909), which dealt with the lives of poor prostitutes.

Her father died during her early infancy and she was raised by relatives. Educated in a boarding school in Moscow, she then worked as a clerk and became involved with various radical groups. Her activities won hr a five year term of imprisonment within the Litovski fortress, and with her release Zasulich worked with the underground press in Kiev.\n\nOutraged by the actions of General Treptov, the despised Imperial governor of St Petersburg, who ordered a political prisoner flogged for not removing his cap, ZasulichÂ inveigled herself into the generalâs presence and shot him dead (1878). She was acquitted and Tsar Alexander II ordered her to be arrested again. Through the intervention of friends she was smuggled to safety in Switzerland. She was one of the founders of the Emancipation of Labour Group in Switzerland (1883) and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Two decades later Zasulich returned to Russia where she spent her later years working as a translator.\n\nZaturenska, Marya â (1902 â 1982)\n\nRussian-American poet and historian\n\nMarya Zaturenska was born at Kiev in the Ukraine. She immigrated to the USA with her family (1910) and was educated at Wisconsin. She became the wife of the noted American critic and poet Horace Gregory (1898 â 1982).

Her father arranged her marriage, at the age of eight (1884) to Ras Ataya Selassie Johannes (1867 â 1888) son of the emperor Johannes IV, by which arrangement Menelik succeeded Johannes as emperor (1889). Her next two marriages ended in divorce, and Zauditu married fourthly (1900) to Ras Gugusa Wate (1877 â 1930), the nephew of her stepmother, the empress Taytu, but their only daughter died in infancy.\n\nHer nephew Lij Iyasu V had been designated his gtandfatherâs heir (1913), but because of his unsuitability and conversion to Islam (1916) he had never been crowned. The government deposed him and proclaimed Zauditu as empress, with Ras Tafari as her regent and heir, though her divorce from Gugusa was insisted upon as part of the agreement. Her reign was torn between the conflicting political ideals of the pro-Western faction, led by Ras Tafari, and the conservative pro-Church faction led by the war minister Hapta Giorgis. Despite this distraction however, Ethiopia joined the League of Nations (1923) and abolished slavery (1924), besides regaining valuable port regions in the Gulf of Aden under Zaudituâs rule.\n\nRas Tafari coveted the throne, but dared not work openly against the empress. With the death of Hapta Giorgis (1928), Ras Tafari incited the empressâs bodyguard to instigate a palace revolution, and Zauditu was forced to crown Ras Tafari as emperor Haile Selassie I. The empressâs former husband Ras Gugsa organized a revolt which Haile Selassie succeeded in neutralizing only with great difficulty. After learning of his capture and execution, the empress collapsed and died at Addis Ababa (April 2, 1930).

She was the recipient of several military awards including the Order of the White Eagle. She then returned to teaching but several years afterwards Zawacka was arrested by the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (1951) and was interrogated and tortured before being sentenced to ten years detention for treason and espionage. She served only four years and was released (1955) whereupon she returned to study at Gdansk University.

A creative and imaginative writer, contemporary literary figures such as Castillo Solorzano and Lope de Vega acclaimed her work, and Zayas is considered the literary forerunner of the feminist movement in Spain.\n\nZeba, JehanÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Musa, Jennifer\n\nZedtwitz, Agnes Klaversahl, Countess vonÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Rasp, Agnes\n\nZeenat Mahal â (c1816 â 1882)\n\nMughal queen\n\nZeenat Mahal was the wife of Bahadur Shah, King of Delhi (1789 â 1862). Zeenat is thought to have been behind the murder of Sir Thomas Metcalfe, the British resident of Delhi (1853). Metcalfe had earned the queenâs hatred as a member of the British council that had decreed that after the death of her aged husband, the title of âkingâ would be allowed to lapse, despite the existence of her own son.\n\nQueen Zeenatâs hatred of the British never diminished, and she was prominent amongst those who urged Bahadur Shah to accept the mutiny against the British (1857). With the failure of the rebellion, the king and queen were captured, Zeenat being forced to beg for her elderly husbandâs life. They were placed in captivity, and were eventually exiled to Rangoon in Burma. Widowed five years later (1862), Zeenat Mahal was never permitted to return to India and died in Rangoon twenty years later.\n\nZehender, MargaretaÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Rottmayr, Margareta Maddalena\n\nZeigman, Celine see Carroll, Jean\n\nZeil-Wurzach, Maria Franziska von â (1630 â 1693)\n\nGerman princess-abbess\n\nCountess Maria Franziska von Zeil-Wurzach was the daughter of Count Johann Jakob von Zeil-Wurzach, and his wife Johanna von Wolckenstein-Trostburg.

Maria Franziska was also appointed as deaconess at the ancient abbey of Essen, in Westphalia. She desired further office at Buchau, the financial position of the order negated the appointment of any further office holders and she was refused (1673). Perhaps out of pique, the countess remained at Essen and was appointed archdeaconess (Propstin). She was denied the position of abbess there (1689) but was later elected as Abbess of Buchau (1692 â 1693)\n\nZein â (1915 â 1994)\n\nQueen consort of Jordan (1951 â 1952)\n\nBorn Zein Al-Sharaf (Aug 2, 1915), she was the daughter of Sharaf Jamal Ali ibn Nasr, who was related to the royal Hijaz dynasty.

She resided with her husband in Istanbul, Turkey, but with his death (July 7, 1972) she was welcomed back to the Jordanian court with all the honours due to a queen mother.

She toured Germany, Austria, France, and Great Britain, with great success. Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler died in Chicago, aged sixty-four (Aug 21, 1927).\n\nZelide Â Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Charriere, Isabella de\n\nZell, Katharina â (1497 â 1562)\n\nGerman Protestant reformer and writer\n\nBorn Katharina Schutz in Strasbourg, in Alsace, she was the daughter of a cabinetmaker. She was married (1523) to the religious reformer Matthew Zell, a former priest, who was excommunicated by the Catholic Church for marrying. Their two children died during early childhood. Katharina assisted her husband with his reforming work, and was heavily involved with the organization of food relief for refugees displaced by the Peasantâs War (1524 â 1525).\n\nApart from composing devotional verse, Zell wrote a treatise in defence of married clergy, and preached from the pulpit at her husbandâs funeral (1548). She edited a religious hymnal (1534) and her work the Brief an die ganze Burgerschaft der Stadt Strasburg (Letter to the Entire Citizenry of the Town of Strasbourg) (1557), was circulated between friends and acquaintances within the burgeoning Protestant community in Strasbourg.\n\nZelle, Margaretha GertruidaÂ Â Â Â seeÂ Â Â Â Mata Hari\n\nZenabe Worq â (1918 â 1933)\n\nImperial Princess of Ethiopia\n\nPrtincess Zenobia Worq was born (July 25, 1918) in Addis Ababa, the second daughter of the Emperor Haile Selassie I (1930 â 1975), being his eldest by his second wife, the Empress Menen.

Princess Zenobia died in childbirth (March 25, 1933) at Makalle, aged only fourteen.\n\nZenatello, Maria GayÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Gay, Maria\n\nZenobia, Septimia (Bat Zabbai) â (c241 â before 298 AD)\n\nQueen of Palmyra\n\nSeptimia Zenobia was the daughter of âAmr, of the tribe of Amila-el-Amalik, and was a relative of King Odaenath, ruler of Palmyra, prior to becoming his second wife (c255 AD). With her husbandâs death (266 AD), to which she may have been privy, Zenobia assumed control of the government in the name of her young son, Vaballath (born c257 AD). She is represented by surviving coinage.\n\nLed by unscrupulous advisers, the queen desired to remove Palmyra from the overlordship of Rome, and she invaded Egypt and occupied large areas of Asia Minor (269 â 270 AD). At first, the emperor Aurelian did little, but when she had her son proclaimed Augustus (271 AD), he quickly recovered both Egypt and Asia Minor, and defeated Zenobiaâs general, Zabdas, in two battles, Antioch and Emesa. The emperor then besieged Palmyra itself. After the surrender Zenobia, her son, and her councillors were taken into captivity. Zenobia was taken back by Aurelian to Rome, where she was publicly exhibited in his triumph, so laden with jewels that she could barely walk (272 AD).\n\nZenobia was granted her life, and a pension, though her son was probably executed. Zenobia was then married off by the emperor to a Roman senator. She is known to have had a villa long the Tiber River, and jewellery, popularly regarded as hers, has been recovered. By her Roman marriage she left several daughters, and her descendants were still traceable in the fifth century.\n\nZenonis, Aelia â (c430 â 476 AD)\n\nByzantine Augusta\n\nAelia Zenonis was the wife (c449 AD) of the usurper emperor Basiliscus (475 â 476 AD), who was brother to the Empress Verina, the wife of Leo I. The couple had three sons, Marcus, Basil, and Leo. When her husband assumed the imperial purple (Jan, 475 AD) Zenonis was accorded the rank of Augusta and figured on the coinage, examples of which have survived. Her eldest son Marcus was appointed Caesar and then joint-Augustus with his father.\n\nIt was due to her influence that Basiliscus offended the Gothic chief Theodoric by transferring the post of magister militium to his nephew Armatus, a young man of fashion, who held the favour of empress Zenonis, and whom gossip accused of being her lover. When the forces of emperor Zeno regained control of Constantinople, the empress fled with her family, and Armatus, to the church of St Sophia.

She was married (1911) to the Archduke Karl (1887 â 1922) who succeeded Franz Josef as emperor (1916). They were crowned king and queen of Hungary at Buda (Dec 30, 1916), but the throne was lost in 1918 and the monarchy abolished (1919). The emperor, empress and their children went into exile to Eckartsau Castle in Switzerland. After two unsuccessful attempts to regain their Hungarian kingdom, Karl and Zita were banished to Madeira, where the emperor died (1922).\n\nAn active, energetic woman, eager to leave an imprint on state policy, her judgement was not always precise. Politically the empress was a good deal more reactionary than her husband. When his ministers proposed abdication to prevent the anarchy of civil war, the empress became enraged, but she was finally persuaded to realize the inevitability of political events.\n\nAfter successfully raising her eight children, the former empress resided at Geneva in Switzerland, close to her eldest son, the Archduke Otto (born 1906) known as Dr von Hapsburg, and his family. For decades the empress was well known as an intrepid traveller, and she and her suite spent months on end in palaces and hotels in different parts of the world. In her last decades the empress made lengthy family visits to her brother Xavier de Bourbon, Duke of Parma and his family, and cared for the interests of her elderly unmarried sisters, especially Henrietta, who was of feeble intellect. She revisited Vienna, her Imperial titles intact (1982) reminding Republicans that her father had succeeded to the ducal throne of Parma in 1854. The last Hapsburg empress died (Nov 14, 1989) at Graubunden, Switzerland, aged almost ninety-seven, having survived her husband almost seventy years. As queen of Hungary, Zita is on record as the longest living queen (1991). Empress Zita was interred in the Kapuchin vault in Vienna. She was portrayed by actress Heather Page in the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) series Fall of Eagles (1974), with Roy McArthur as the Emperor Karl.\n\nZita of Lucca â (1218 â 1272)\n\nItalian servant and saint\n\nZita of Lucca was born at Monsagrati, near Lucca. She was attached to the household of the Fatinelli family from an early age as a domestic servant (1230). Known for her hardworking nature and generosity to the poor, which involved her in altercations with her fellow workers and her employers, her kindly and pious nature eventually won Zita the respect and admiration of all. Zita died (April 27, 1272) and was later canonized (1696) and was later declared the patroness of all those in domestic service (1953). Her popular cult spread to England during the Middle Ages and she was known there as St Sitha.\n\nZitz, Kathinka â (1801 â 1877)\n\nGerman writer\n\nHer marriage was disastrously unhappy, and eventually her worthless husband threw her out into the street and she tried to eek out a living by writing. She published many stories, using various pseudonyms, which dealt mainly with the themes important in ordinary life. Zitz also produced fictionalised biographies of several famous contemporary people such as Lord Byron, Heinrich Heine, and the salonniere Rahel Varnhagen von Ense.\n\nZiydah, May â (1886 â 1941)\n\nArab poet and essayist\n\nMay Ziydah was born in Palestine and was educated and raised in Lebanon. When her father took up the position of a newspaper editor in Cairo, Egypt, May accompanied him there with the rest of her family (1908). Fluent in French, she is considered the first professional female Arabic author, and established her own famous literary salon in Cairo, which was held on the Tuesday of each week. She received politicians, artists, and journalists in her home and was regarded as a literary muse to her devoted adherents. She reviewed the work of the poet Khalil Gibran entitled Broken Wings (1912) and this ultimately led to a seventeen year correspondence between the two (1914 â 1931). These letters were edited and published in Arabic only after her death, and translated into English as Blue Flame (1987).\n\nZmichowska, Narcyza â (1819 â 1876)\n\nPolish novelist\n\nNarcyza Zmichowska worked as a teacher and had links with various Polish patriotic groups. Her novel Poganka (the heathen woman) (1846), is considered one of the finest pieces of Polish romantic fiction. Her other well-known work was Czy to Powiesc? (Is this a novel?) (1877) was a psychological portrait of a fictional but contemporary female of Narcyzaâs generation. She sometimes used the pseudonym âGabryella.â\n\nZoe Karbonopsina â (c883 â before 944)\n\nByzantine Augusta\n\nZoe Karbonopsina came from noble patrician ancestry, being related to the noted admiral Himerios, and to the chronicler, Theophanes the Confessor. She became the mistress of the emperor Leo VI (866 â 912) after the death of his third wife Eudokia Baiana (901). Leo did not marry Zoe until after she had borne their son, Constantine VII (905), becoming his fourth wife, a situation which caused much strife with the religious authorities, which viewed this marriage as uncanonical. The young prince was baptized by the patriarch of Constantinople, but Leo married Zoe secretly. The patriarchâs continued opposition to the legality of the marriage led to his replacement with Euthymios (907).\n\nWith Leoâs death he was briefly succeeded by his brother Alexander (912 â 913) who caused the empress to be banished from the palace. She returned to the palace at his death but was again forced to retire to a convent before overthrowing the patriarch Nicholad Mystikos and being proclaimed as regent for her son (914). Aided by her trusted adviser, Leo Phokas, the empress revoked previous concessions made to Simeon of Bulgaria and renewed the war between the two countries. Her troops defeated the Arab forces in Armenia (915) but Phokas was crushingly defeated at the battles of Anchialus and Katasyrtai (917). These reverses led to renewed Arab raids, which forced Zoeâs government to make a humiliating peace treaty with the Arabs in Sicily. The empressâs hold on affairs continued to slide and eventually Zoe was removed from power in a political coup. The noted general Romanus Lekapenus gained power, married his daughter Helena Lekapena to Constantine VII, and was proclaimed co-ruler with his son-in-law (919).\n\nEmpress Zoe was forced to retire from court to a convent, and never emerged. She is thought to have died before Romanus I was deposed from power (944). Her popular surname of âKarbonopsinaâ was a reference to her beautiful âcoal-black eyes.â Surviving coinage portrays Zoeâs portrait jointly with that of her son.\n\nZoe âthe Macedonianâ â (978 â 1050)Â\n\nByzantine Augusta\n\nPrincess Zoe was born in Constantinople, the second daughter of the Emperor Constantine VIII and his wife Helena Alypina. A regal and beautiful woman, she was betrothed in her youth (1001) to the Holy Roman emperor Otto III, but his early death (1002) prevented this match from eventuating. After her elder sister Eudocia entered a convent after having been stricken with smallpox, Zoe became her fatherâs heir. He arranged her marriage to Romanus III Argyrus (968 â 1034), and with Constantineâs death (1028), the couple ruled together, Zoeâs younger sister Theodora being sent to a convent.\n\nThough a regal and beautiful woman (and Psellus actually knew her) Zoeâs marriage with Romanus III was not congenial, and the empress took as her lover Michael (IV) the son of a peasant. They caused Romanus to be drowned in his bath (1034), and then Zoe had Michael proclaimed emperor and married him. This marriage also turned out badly, the empress being confined within the womenâs quarters of the Imperial palace, where she devoted her time to perfecting different techniques for producing beauty unguents. Nevertheless Michael still managed to convince Zoe to adopt his own nephew, Michael V, as his successor and granted him the rank of Caesar before he himself abdicated and retired to a monastery (1041).\n\nMichael V then exiled the empress to a convent on the island of Prinkipos (1042), but the people, with whom she had always been a favourite, rose up in outrage at her banishment. The emperor quickly recalled Zoe to the capital, but was caught and blinded by the mob. Zoe and her sister Theodora now ruled jointly together, though the younger observed the elderâs seniority without any sign if rancour or resentment. Â Zoe remarried in 1042 to her third and last husband, Constantine IX Monomachus (c980 â 1056). The couple ruled together till Zoeâs death, the empress amicably accepting Constantineâs mistress, Maria Sklerena at the Imperial court. With Zoeâs death (1050), Constantine rued alone till his own death, passing the throne to her sister Theodora (1055 â 1056), the last of the Macedonian dynasty.\n\nZofia of HungaryÂ Â Â see Â Â Sophia\n\nZorach, Margeurite â (1887 â 1968)\n\nAmerican painter\n\nBorn Margeurite Thompson in Santa Rosa, California, she studied at Stanford University, and the La Palette modernist school in Paris (1908 â 1911).

She became the first wife (1505) of Gerald Fitzgerald (1487 â 1534), ninth Earl of Kildare, to whom she bore several children. The countess was a well-known and respected figure during her lifetime. Her husband was much attached to her and it was only when death removed her sensible advice, that his career downturned.\n\nElizabeth Zouche was a woman in intellectual pursuits who fostered education. Lord Devlin, the son-in-law of the eleventh Earl of Kildare, prepared a primer of the Irish language for Queen Elizabeth I, for whose encouragement he observed that, ââ¦men yett lyvinge, which knewe Elizabethe Zouche, daughter to the Lord Zouche, sometime Countesse of Kyldare, do affirme that in short tyme she learned to reade, write and perfectly speak the tongue.â Lady Elizabeth died (Oct 6, 1517) at Lucan, aged under thirty.

Zubaidahâs refusal to seek revenge, and her generosity towards her stepson and his wife Queen Buran, ushered in a period of political and dynastic peace. Zubaidah then resided in retirement and made her last public appearance during her sixth pilgrimage to Mecca, shortly before her death.
