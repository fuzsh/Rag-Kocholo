Notes on the Musicians of Stanisław Ciołek Poniatowski (1676–1762) - Free download as PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read online for free. This document summarizes a recent study by Irena Bieńkowska analyzing archival materials from the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw regarding musical activity at the court of Stanisław Poniatowski from 1676-1762. The study uncovered new details about the musicians and musical ensembles at Poniatowski's court. Poniatowski came from a noble family and had a successful political and military career. Documents found describe a band of 7 Polish musicians who served at his court for many years. The study provides new insights into musical patronage at 18th century Polish noble courts.",
