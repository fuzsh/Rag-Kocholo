A member of the "Familia," in 1763 he declined to be a candidate for the Polish crown, preferring instead to be a patron of the arts, and withdrawing in favor of Stanisław August Poniatowski.[1] Together with his wife, he created at the Czartoryski Palace in Puławy a major center of Polish intellectual and political life.

He served from 1758 as general starost of Podolia.[1] Founder of the "Little Monitor", in 1765 he co-founded the Monitor, the leading periodical of the Polish Enlightenment. In 1766 he reorganized the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1] In 1767 he joined the Radom Confederation.[1] In 1768 he became the commander of the School of Chivalry (Corps of Cadets).[1] In 1788-1792 he was Deputy from Lublin to the "Four-Year Sejm."[1] Drawing closer the king once again, he became a leader of the Patriotic Party and co-founder of Poland's Commission of National Education.[1] He supported the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, and headed a diplomatic mission to Dresden, attempting to convince Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony to support the Commonwealth and accept its throne (after Poniatowski's future death).[1] He refused to joint the Targowica Confederation established to bring the Constitution down.

He received the Order of the White Eagle on November 25, 1764.
