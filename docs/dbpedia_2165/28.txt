BBC America announced Friday that we can look forward to new seasons of both Planet Earth and Frozen Planet â€” even if their respective premieres are a long way off. Frozen Planet II will air in 2021, while Planet Earth III will not premiere until 2022.

Frozen Planet II will take audiences back to the wildernesses of the Arctic and Antarctica. Ten years on from the original Frozen Planet, this series tells the complete story of the entire frozen quarter of our planet that's locked in ice and blanketed in snow.

The BBC claims that Planet Earth III will be the most ambitious natural history landmark ever undertaken by the BBC. Combining the awe and wonder of the original Planet Earth, the new science and discoveries of Blue Planet II and Planet Earth II, and the immersive character-led storytelling of Dynasties, the series will take the 'Planet Earth' experience to new heights.
