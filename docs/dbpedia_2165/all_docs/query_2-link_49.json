        "text": "Frozen Planet is a BBC nature series narrated by David Attenborough that looks at the environment and life in the Antarctic and Arctic. It sets out to provide a visual record of the polar regions and how climate change is impacting landforms made of ice and sea ice.\n\nThe series shows the impact that the changes to landforms and sea ice are having on wildlife. It depicts the challenges that various animals face as a result, including polar bears, wolves, penguins, seals, and eider ducks.\n\nFrozen Planet is beautifully filmed and presents facts in a realistic manner which at times means disturbing images. It is visually striking with a compelling storyline and narration to make a strong impact on a topic that is important and relevant."
