In addition, the network released today the all-new official trailer for the series. Executive produced by Emmy® Award-winner Mike Gunton (Planet Earth II, Dynasties II) and series-produced by Emmy® Award-nominee Matt Brandon (Cities: Nature’s New Wild), renowned naturalist and three-time Emmy® Award-winner Sir David Attenborough (Planet Earth II, Blue Planet II, Frozen Planet II) presents the eight-episode groundbreaking and cinematic series.\n\nSeven years after the Emmy® and BAFTA® Award-winning Planet Earth II, the eagerly anticipated Planet Earth III will journey across the continents revealing the wonders of our planet. This spellbinding series will feature never before seen behavior, and dive deep into the stories and animal characters which reflect the new challenges that wildlife face in our modern, crowded world. The series will also highlight the growing need to preserve and restore nature. In the final episode, viewers will meet some of the dedicated ‘heroes’ across the globe who put their lives on the line to protect the wildlife and the critically important ecosystems of Planet Earth.\n\nComposers Hans Zimmer, Jacob Shea, Sara Barone and Bastille’s Dan Smith collaborated across the Planet Earth III series score. These stunning soundscapes feature Dan Smith’s vocals on the opening title theme song, as well as within all episodes of the series. Their collaborative reworking of Bastille’s hit single Pompeii, entitled Pompeii MMXXIII, features on the series end credits.\n\nPlanet Earth III is BBC Studios Natural History Production co-produced with BBC AMERICA, ZDF and France Televisions in partnership with The Open University for BBC.
