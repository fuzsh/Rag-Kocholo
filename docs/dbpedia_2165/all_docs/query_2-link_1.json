The production team, which includes executive producer Alastair Fothergill and series producer Vanessa Berlowitz, were previously responsible for the award-winning series The Blue Planet (2001) and Planet Earth (2006), and Frozen Planet is billed as a sequel of sorts.[citation needed] David Attenborough returns as narrator.[3] It is distributed under licence by the BBC in other countries, Discovery Channel for North America, ZDF for Germany, Antena 3 for Spain and Skai TV for Greece.[4]\n\nThe seven-part series focuses on life and the environment in both the Arctic and Antarctic. The production team were keen to film a comprehensive record of the natural history of the polar regions because climate change is affecting landforms such as glaciers, ice shelves, and the extent of sea ice. The series was met with critical acclaim and holds a Metacritic score of 91/100.[5]\n\nWhilst the series was broadcast in full in the UK, the BBC chose to make the series' seventh episode, which focuses on climate change, optional for syndication in order to aid sales of the show in countries where the issue is politically sensitive. The US Discovery Channel originally announced that they would air only the first six episodes of the show, but they later added the seventh episode to their schedule.[6][7]\n\nIn 2012, the US broadcast won four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Nonfiction Series.[8] A sequel titled Frozen Planet II began aring in September 2022, which covers more frozen habitats than just the polar regions, while also emphasizing more on the threat of climate change.\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nFrozen Planet finished filming in 2010 and focused on the challenges facing polar bears and Arctic wolves in the north and Adelie penguins and wandering albatrosses in the south, although many other storylines are developed. After an introductory episode, the subsequent four episodes depict the changing seasons at the poles, before an episode focusing on mankind's activities there.[9] The final episode, \"On Thin Ice\", examines how global warming is affecting the polar regions.[10] Filmmakers worked in new locations, including Antarctica's active volcanoes and the Russian Arctic. Sequences captured include migrating eider ducks, footage of a fur seal colony from the air, and pack hunting of seals by killer whales. The aerial photography used the Cineflex and Gyron cameras pioneered on Planet Earth, which enable steady footage to be captured from long range without disturbing the animals.\n\nFrom late April to early May 2009, BBC crews were in Hay River, Northwest Territories, Canada[11] filming the annual breakup of the river of the same name, which flows into Great Slave Lake.\n\nZoo-filmed material\n\n[edit]\n\nThe BBC was accused of staging after it was reported that one scene of a polar bear giving birth was filmed in a Dutch (initially reported as German) animal park.[12][13] The BBC defended its faking of the shots,[14] explaining that it would have been impossible to film the event in the wild without endangering the cubs, that the commentary was careful not to mislead the audience,[15] and that the Frozen Planet website had already explained how the scene was captured before the story appeared in the media.[16]\n\nBroadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nFrozen Planet was broadcast on BBC One starting 26 October 2011. Each of the first six episodes comprises the main programme followed by a 10-minute featurette called Freeze Frame, which shows how some of the sequences were filmed. David Attenborough's principal role is to narrate the programmes, but he appears briefly on camera to give an introduction and a closing statement. For the seventh programme, \"On Thin Ice\", he serves as writer and presenter for what was billed by the BBC as a personal statement on the effects of climate change at the poles. A special programme called \"Frozen Planet: The Epic Journey\" featuring re-edited highlights from the series was broadcast on BBC One on 28 December 2011.\n\nIn the United States, Frozen Planet premiered on the Discovery Channel on 18 March 2012 with Alec Baldwin replacing David Attenborough as narrator of the first six episodes.[17][18] The \"Autumn\" episode from the BBC series was replaced by \"The Making of Frozen Planet\", a compilation of the Freeze Frame featurettes, and the title of the sixth episode was changed from \"The Last Frontier\" to \"Life in the Freezer\". The network originally decided not to broadcast Attenborough's \"On Thin Ice\" episode, citing \"scheduling conflicts\", but later reversed their decision,[19][20] and \"On Thin Ice\" was broadcast on Earth Day, 22 April 2012.\n\nIn Australia, the series was broadcast on the Nine Network beginning on 27 October 2011. In France, the series has been acquired by France Television, and aired in March–April 2013 under the name \"Terres de Glace\".[21]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nAll episode names from BBC website.[22] Ratings include overnight audience shares, with consolidated viewers supplied by BARB.[23]\n\nNo.TitleOriginal air dateUK viewers\n\n(millions)1\"To the Ends of the Earth\"26 October 2011 ( )8.81 million viewers[23] (27.4% audience share)[24]\n\nThe opening travels from the North Pole to the South Pole encountering different climates and landscapes on the way.

Most animals give birth to their offspring. Animals highlighted in this episode include the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) hunting for ringed seal (Pusa hispida), the narwhal (Monodon monoceros), a species of sea gooseberry (phylum Ctenophora), a species of sea slug, a species of sea snail, the Arctic cod (could be Arctogadus glacialis or Boreogadus saida), the Arctic woolly bear moth (Gynaephora groenlandica), the Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), the macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), and the killer whale (O. orca).\n\n3\"Summer\"9 November 2011 ( )8.84 million viewers[23] (29.0% audience share)[26]\n\nThis episode follows the short polar summer: the sun does not set for months and the ice is largely gone. Animals highlighted in this episode include the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), the red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius), the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), the common eider (Somateria mollissima), the snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), the Lapland bunting (Calcarius lapponicus), the Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos) hunting for muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), the king penguin (A. patagonicus), the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), the crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus), the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the humpback whale (M. novaeangliae), the Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) being hunted by killer whales, and the Adélie penguin being hunted by south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki).\n\n4\"Autumn\"16 November 2011 ( )7.29 million viewers[23] (22.3% audience share)[27]\n\nThis episode follows the polar autumn: temperatures are dropping, seas are freezing, and arctic animals migrate south away from the expanding ice.

In the north, Longyearbyen and Norilsk are among the coldest permanent settlements in the world. The Dolgan tribe of northern Russia is dependent on reindeer while the Inuit of Chukotka risk their lives hunting for walruses and collecting guillemot eggs. Also, Special Forces defend the Danish claim to Greenland, and in Alaska, rockets are used to study the spectacular aurora borealis.\n\nAntarctica has no permanent human residents, but people visit the continent for various reasons. Tourists visit to see king penguins, biologists use robot submarines to discover new life forms, geologists study the active volcano Mount Erebus and its unique caves, and astronomers use balloons to study cosmic rays. Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station is located exactly at the South Pole; it is named after the leaders of the first two expeditions to reach the Pole, Roald Amundsen (in 1911) and Robert Falcon Scott (in 1912).\n\n7\"On Thin Ice\"7 December 2011 ( )8.07 million viewers[23] (27.4% audience share)[30]\n\nThe episode follows about the climate change, global warming, the melting of the ice caps and their consequences.

Ten networks that would have run the episode opted out, citing fear of controversy.[34]\n\nOn 6 December 2011, the Discovery Channel announced it would air the seventh and final episode of Frozen Planet.[7] \"On Thin Ice\" includes on-camera shots of Attenborough, who narrates the British version, discussing what shrinking glaciers and rising temperatures mean for people and wildlife that live in the region, as well as the rest of the planet. The music for this episode was composed by Barnaby Taylor.\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series quickly became a ratings success in the UK, with the second episode broadcast on 2 November 2011 becoming the highest-rated natural history programme there since 2001.[35] The series drew an average audience of 8.67 million viewers.[36]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2012, Frozen Planet won in three categories at the British Academy Television Craft Awards, collecting prizes for best sound, best editing, and best photography.[37] At the BAFTA Television Awards, Frozen Planet was nominated for Best Specialist Factual and the YouTube Audience Award, but lost in both categories.[38] It was also nominated for a Royal Television Society award.[39]\n\nThe US broadcast won four prizes at the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in September 2012, including outstanding nonfiction series, cinematography, sound editing, and picture editing.[40] The following month, it won in three categories at the Wildscreen Festival in Bristol, UK, taking the Panda Awards for best sound, best cinematography, and best series, the latter shared with Human Planet.[41] In January 2013, the series won the public vote for Best Documentary Series at the UK's National Television Awards, beating out Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, One Born Every Minute and Planet Earth Live.[42]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee Result Ref. 2012 Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards Outstanding Nonfiction Series Alastair Fothergill, Susan Winslow, Vanessa Berlowitz Won [40] Outstanding Cinematography for a Nonfiction Program Cinematography Team (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won Outstanding Picture Editing for a Nonfiction Program Andy Netley, Sharon Gillooly (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won Outstanding Sound Editing for a Nonfiction or Reality Program (Single or Multi-Camera) Kate Hopkins, Tim Owens, Paul Fisher (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Nonfiction or Reality Program (Single or Multi-Camera) Graham Wild, Archie Moore (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Nominated British Academy Television Awards Best Specialist Factual David Attenborough, Vanessa Berlowitz, Alastair Fothergill, Mark Linfield Nominated [43] YouTube Audience Award Frozen Planet Nominated British Academy Television Craft Awards Best Director: Factual Vanessa Berlowitz, Chadden Hunter, Kathryn Jeffs (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Nominated Best Editing: Factual Nigel Buck, Andy Netley, Dave Pearce (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won Best Original Music George Fenton Nominated British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Photography: Factual Camera Team (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won Best Sound: Factual Kate Hopkins, Tim Owens, Graham Wild (for \"To the Ends of the Earth\") Won\n\nMerchandise\n\n[edit]\n\nDVD and Blu-ray\n\n[edit]\n\nThree disc region-free Blu-ray and Region 2+4 DVD box sets were released on 8 December 2011, and include the complete series as broadcast in the UK,[44][45] although On Thin Ice is considered a special feature on the third disc.
