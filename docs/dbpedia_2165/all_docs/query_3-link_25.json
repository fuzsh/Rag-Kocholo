        "text": "The ultimate portrait of the earth's Polar Regions.\n\nIn 2012 the Discovery Channel will broadcast Frozen Planet, the long-awaited third installment in the BBC Earth series of which Blue Planet: Seas of Life and Planet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before won multiple Emmy awards.\n\nFrozen Planet is the companion book to the TV series. It follows the world's best wildlife photographers as they capture animal behavior and landscapes never seen before, including Antarctica's active volcanoes and the previously restricted Russian Arctic. Custom-designed HD cameras allowed undisturbed observation. Traveling by nuclear submarine, military helicopter, icebreaker and snowmobile, the filmmakers endured piercing polar winters and the dangerous summer \"melt\" to record what may be the dying days of Earth's frozen regions.\n\nFrozen Planet has seven sections:\n\nPole to Pole\n\nSpring: Life Wakes Up\n\nSummer: Life Multiplies\n\nAutumn: Life Retreats\n\nWinter: Life Closes Down\n\nOn Thin Ice\n\nTales from the Poles\n\nIt follows four polar residents that reveal the health of the planet and what the future may hold: the polar bear and arctic fox in the north; the Adelie penguin and wandering albatross in the south. \"Behind the scenes\" segments describe the making of the TV series.\n\nSome of the fascinating stories are:\n\nIcebergs the size of New York skyscrapers\n\nThe first record of killer whales hunting in packs\n\n80,000 smelly macaroni penguins on Bird Island\n\nA very rare blond fur seal pup\n\nSatellite tagged wandering albatrosses raising their chicks\n\nKing penguins catching a wave\n\nA lone white wolf eyeing a photographer\n\nGrass-eating polar bears\n\nThe creeping glaciers of Svalbard\n\nAdelie penguin chicks learning to swim\n\nKiller whales using their tails to wash seals off ice flows\n\nCanada's Barrenlands coming to life in the spring\n\nA polar bear stalking a film crew\n\nScuba diving with beluga whales in the Russian Arctic\n\nThe elusive Greenland shark\n\nSales of the companion book to the Blue Planet television series topped 6 million dollars. Frozen Planet promises to be an equal or greater success. The important topic, the expected demand from Discovery Channel viewers and an excellent price make it an essential purchase."
