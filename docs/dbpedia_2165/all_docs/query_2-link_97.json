        "text": "The filmmaker behind the season, Mark Brownlow, recently spoke to Radio Times magazine about balancing \"the gloomy to the glorious\" and making sure the series is reflective of current times.\n\n\"We have to tell the contemporary story of what’s happening,\" he said. \"Long gone are the days when we could show you a paradise and forget about the issues – I think we’d be laughed out of the room if we didn’t nail climate change.\"\n\nSo, when will Frozen Planet II be coming to BBC One and how can you watch it? Read on for everything you need to know.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe new series kicks off on Sunday 11th September at 8pm on BBC One, with new episodes set to air weekly.\n\nThere will be six episodes in total, all of which are narrated by Attenborough.\n\nWill Frozen Planet II be available on iPlayer?\n\nThe new series will also be available on BBC iPlayer, where the original Frozen Planet can also be streamed.\n\nWhat is Frozen Planet II about?\n\nFrozen Planet II will lift the lid on how a host of extraordinary creatures battle to survive in frozen realms across the globe, from the Arctic and the Antarctic to mountains, forests, oceans and even deserts.\n\nThe new series will feature footage of a range of spectacular animals, as well as looking at how their habitats are undergoing devastating change.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Times magazine, Brownlow pointed out how the new series will bring environmental storytelling to the fore.\n\n\"We’re taking the audience to Narnia, with what I hope is going to be the right mix of wonder, entertainment and education,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of new stories, breath-taking new drama, wonderful moments of humour, stunning landscapes, but underpinned with the message that these places are changing and changing faster than we ever imagined. We are capturing this fast-changing, dynamic world in its exquisite beauty but also telling the story of how these changes are impacting the wildlife.\"\n\nFrozen Planet II — is there a trailer?\n\nYes, a trailer has landed for Frozen Planet II, teasing breathtaking footage of seals, penguins and a majestic Siberian tiger.\n\nPolar bears, killer whales, walruses and even a bumble bee also feature in the footage.
