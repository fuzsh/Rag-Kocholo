        "text": "Frozen Planet\n\nFrozen Planet is a nature documentary series, co-produced by the BBC, the Discovery Channel and The Open University, focusing on life and the environment in both the Arctic and Antarctic. The series consists of seven episodes which provide a portrait of Earth's polar regions: the last great wilderness on the planet. The first episode introduces the program, taking us on an extraordinary journey across the polar regions of our planet, North and South. The subsequent four episodes depict the changing seasons at the polar regions - Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The sixth episode focuses on mankind's activities in the regions. And the seventh and final episode investigates what rising temperatures will mean for the people and wildlife that live there and for the rest of the planet.\n\nEpisode 1 - To the Ends of the Earth\n\nEpisode 1 - To the Ends of the Earth\n\nDavid Attenborough travels to the ends of our planet, the Arctic and Antarctic that are the greatest and least known wildernesses of all.\n\nEpisode 2 - Spring\n\nSpring arrives in the polar regions, and the sun appears after an absence of five months; warmth and life return to these magical ice worlds - the greatest seasonal transformation on our planet is underway.\n\nEpisode 3 - Summer\n\nIt is high summer in the polar regions, and the sun never sets. Vast hordes of summer visitors cram a lifetime of drama into one long, magical day; they must feed, fight and rear their young in this brief window of plenty.\n\nEpisode 4 - Autumn\n\nFor the animals in the polar regions, autumn means dramatic battles and epic journeys. Time is running out - the Arctic Ocean is freezing over and the sea ice is advancing at 2.5 miles per day around Antarctica.\n\nEpisode 5 - Winter\n\nThere is no greater test for life than winter, as temperatures plummet to 70 below and winds reach 200kph. Darkness and ice extend across the polar regions and only a few remarkable survivors gamble on remaining.\n\nEpisode 6 - The Last Frontier\n\nThis episode reveals the extraordinary riches and wonders of the polar regions that have kept people visiting them for thousands of years.\n\nEpisode 7 - On Thin Ice\n\nDavid Attenborough journeys to both polar regions to investigate what rising temperatures will mean for the people and wildlife that live there and for the rest of the planet.\n\nRelated Links Frozen Planet - wikipedia\n\nFrozen Planet is a nature documentary series, co-produced by the BBC, the Discovery Channel and The Open University.
