        "text": "A Chance Scientific Discovery\n\nTo capture unique wildlife behavior, we often rely on the help of scientists in the field and filming the Lapland bumblebee was no exception. Our team was joined on location by biologists Pierre Rasmont, Baptiste Martinet, and Kimberly Przybyla from the University of Mons and Richard Gill from Imperial College London.\n\nHowever, during the filming we get to spend a lot of time observing our subjects and sometimes this leads us witness behavior that is new even to science. On this occasion, I was lucky enough to discover the nest of a Lapland bumblebee queen — something that had never been recorded before. Not only did this allow us to film the behavior of the nesting queen for the first time, but it also led to new insights in bumblebee biology that Martinet and his colleagues published in a scientific paper.\n\nProduction Details\n\nDocumentary series\n\n6 × 58 minutes, 1.78:1\n\nProduced by BBC Studios\n\nReleased on BBC One in 2022\n\nArctic: Our Frozen Planet is an IMAX and giant screen feature adaptation based on some of the same original stories\n\nOfficial website\n\nCredits\n\nEp. 5, “Frozen Lands”: Director of Photography for the Lapland bumblebee sequence\n\nEp. 6, “Our Frozen Planet”: Additional Photography"
