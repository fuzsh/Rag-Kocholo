In our warming world we are losing ice at a rate which is changing life at our poles and life far beyond them. This is inspiring perhaps the greatest technological revolution ever seen as we develop solutions to stop our planet warming.\n\nDid you know?\n\nClean, renewable energy is key to saving our frozen worlds. China is on its way to producing 40% of all the world's clean energy by 2022 and India's renewable generation energy is set to double in the next four years."
