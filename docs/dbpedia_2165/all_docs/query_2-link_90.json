        "text": "About:\n\nSir David Attenborough returns with a third (and likely final) series of his flagship documentary series, Planet Earth. Following the sequel series' to Blue Planet and Frozen Planet, this landmark series will once again take us on a journey around the globe revealing the natural wonders of our planet.\n\nFilmed over five years, Planet Earth III uses groundbreaking drone cameras \"to reveal the greatest wonders of life on earth\", from remote jungles to scorching deserts. In a first for the series, the final episode - 'Heroes' – will take a look at the people who have devoted their lives to protecting the planet's wildlife.\n\nBlockbuster composer Hans Zimmer scores the visuals, this time collaborating with Bastille's Dan Smith. The pair have even created a new version of the band's hit 'Pompeii' to be used over the end credits of each episode. Behind the scenes, Planet Earth II producer Mike Gunton returns, alongside Matt Brandon (Cities: Nature's New Wild).\n\nWhat was the hardest sequence to film?\n\nNick Easton, Producer-Director for Coasts/Freshwater episodes of Planet Earth III:\n\n\"Coasts was a particularly ambitious undertaking, with completely new, never-before-studied (let alone filmed!) stories in garter snakes and archer fish, outright gambles in filming Namibia's elusive lions on the coast, some extraordinary crew endeavour to capture flamingos in a storm, technological firsts in southern right whales and a very… long… wait… for specific conditions for the opening surfing sequence. But one story stands out for me.\n\n\"The struggle between the Cape fur seals and the great white shark has been a developing story on the South African coast for the last few years. The sharks' increased presence on this stretch of coast is still poorly understood, as is their behaviour generally. And of course, they are notoriously dangerous predators. The crew themselves had to become the experts in order to capture the most complete telling of this scene ever told. This took a nail biting four years.\n\n\"With each year, and every shoot, the team (including local boat and camera operators, and international crew, all overseen by Assistant Producer Georgie Ward) refined their understanding of the sharks and the fur seals, and the methods required to capture the action safely, but up close on camera. The final shoot in 2021 was a culmination of all that hard work, delivering some of the most compelling shots of great white sharks ever captured, and an extraordinary record of their interaction with their plucky prey.\"\n\nPlanet Earth III in numbers:\n\nTotal number of filming days: 1,904\n\nTotal number of shoots: 134\n\nTotal number of shoots managed remotely: 50\n\nTotal number of countries filmed in: 43 countries across six continents\n\nCrew from 27 countries were involved with this production\n\nRarest animal filmed: Morona-Santiago Harlequin Frog (Atelopus halihelos), appears in episode eight, there are no more than 49 individuals left.\n\nQ&A with Mike Gunton, Executive Producer:\n\nMike Gunton is the Creative Director of Factual and The Natural History Unit for BBC Studios. Within this role, Mike works as an executive producer on titles for the BBC, Apple, NBC, and Nat Geo/Disney+, and is responsible for bringing new and pioneering stories about the natural world to global audiences. Mike's recent series include the record-breaking Planet Earth II, winner of four BAFTAs and two Emmys, followed by the ground-breaking animal behaviour series Dynasties. In 2022 he turned his attention to the world of plants in The Green Planet, and the world of dinosaurs with Prehistoric Planet.\n\nHow does Planet Earth III build upon the previous series of Planet Earth?\n\nThe first series of Planet Earth was about witnessing the wonderful spectacle and awe-inspiring beauty of our planet and taking the viewer to the last remaining areas of wilderness that were still untouched by humanity. Planet Earth II was about connecting the viewer intimately with the animals, to be alongside them, experiencing their triumphs and their struggles. Planet Earth III is about the resilience and adaptability of nature, and the remarkable animals that are changing their lives to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world dominated more than ever by a powerful force: us. It's full of surprise and wonder but seen from a new perspective.\n\nDid you have any unique wildlife encounters during filming for this series?\n\nMy answer might surprise you because it doesn't involve a remote location or an exotic species. It was actually a very simple moment. Our final day of filming for the series was with David in a quintessential English flower meadow on a sunny late summer's day. It was the very meadow that Charles Darwin used to observe and explore while he ruminated on his theories about the natural world and evolution. The meadow was alive with bees and insects, grasshoppers were singing out their melodies all around us and there was an abundance of butterflies floating on the warm air. Both David and I said it was truly magical and it gave me hope that if we can protect and restore and allow nature to work its miracles, then future generations will be able experience that magic for many years to come.\n\nWhat was it like to work with David Attenborough again?\n\nIt was a privilege as always. David was able to bring the wisdom, enthusiasm, knowledge and, in places, the fun we needed for this series. At 97, he still possesses a unique ability to immediately captivate the viewer with his presence and his words. He was passionate about the stories we needed to tell and wanted to be part of the show from the outset.\n\nHow do you maintain a balance between due concern and wide-eyed wonder?\n\nThis has always been something we have had to grapple with - to connect the viewer to the places and the animals we film in a way that cannot fail to create affinity and empathy, while at the same time exploring the harder truths in a way that does not make people want to turn away, or leave them feeling helpless. I think audiences now, more than ever, want to know the truth, they want to understand it, and they look to us for answers. We hold a great responsibility as filmmakers to create that spark of deep passion for our natural world, and to bear witness to the challenges that it now faces.\n\nWhat do you hope personally that people will take away from this new series?\n\nThat we are pushing species, habitats and individual animals to the brink of their ability to survive and adapt, but the natural world has an extraordinary capacity to heal itself if we give it the chance. We need to make space, make sacrifices and use our remarkable human ingenuity and creativity to bring change for the benefit of these wild places and wild animals, and ourselves.\n\nTrailer:\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNWXMAJF7ww\n\nEpisode list:\n\n1.
