        "text": "Plus! The chance to win a double ticket to an exclusive pre-screening in Joburg – let David Attenborough take you on a tour of the world’s frozen places, this time with ultra-high definition and the latest camera technology\n\nThe brand-new, breath-taking BBC natural history landmark series, Frozen Planet II, premieres on BBC Earth (DStv channel 184) on Monday 13 February at 8pm. The seven-part series, including the Making Of, takes viewers around the world’s coldest places, and just because we’re known for our heat and droughts, don’t think Africa is excluded.\n\nIn 2011, Frozen Planet gave BBC viewers an unprecedented insight into life in the Poles. Now, 11 years later, Frozen Planet II - narrated by Sir David Attenborough – returns to the Arctic and Antarctic, but also explores life beyond the Poles: our high mountains, frozen deserts, snowbound forests, and ice-cold oceans.\n\nExecutive Producer Mark Brownlow – who also worked on some of the most famous nature documentaries including Blue Planet II, Planet Earth II and Seven Worlds, One Planet – says as documentary makers, their team want to surprise the audience in every episode. “I felt that we could broaden out the series to really surprise the audience with the breadth and variety of all the different frozen worlds scattered across our globe. Remarkably, at any given time, a fifth of our planet is covered in snow or blanketed in ice,” he points out. “And particularly now, because this is the fastest changing region on Earth due to human-caused climate change. We felt that there was a universal film to be made that was contemporary, fresh and had real relevance, linked in to the audience’s greater consciousness around climate change.”\n\nIn this series you can tune in to see a rare chameleon that lives on the high slopes of the mighty Mount Kenya, where frost descends as nightfall sets in and the tropical sun warms it up during the day. In these two extreme climates, the cold-blooded reptile must ensure she gives birth at the right time to save her babies from a freezing death.\n\nThese cold regions fall in the last true wildernesses on earth, places so challenging for survival that only a heroic cast of animals can live here. From polar bears to penguins, Siberian tigers to snow monkeys, each species must overcome unique challenges to survive their extreme environments.\n\n“With the help of scientists we installed ruggedized time lapse cameras at the top of Quelccaya in the Andes, and down in Rothera in Antarctica, as well as up in Svalbard in the Arctic. We've positioned time lapse cameras long term to show the change taking place on our watch. We have also commandeered satellites to capture these changes from space, to get the bigger picture,” says Brownlow.\n\nThe new technology and broader scope means Frozen Planet II is truly a chance to experience the wonder of our planet’s frozen realms as they stand on the brink of major change."
