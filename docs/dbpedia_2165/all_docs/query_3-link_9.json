        "text": "The documentary genre’s roots lie in education. A form in which television critics and academics alike have subjected it to criticisms in the way in which truth has been deployed. The long debated question in regards to documentary is it’s purpose to both inform and and the same time entertain and engage the audience in its context. In this essay I will be examining the ways in which documentary, and in particular the nature documentary sub-genre is subject to the contemporary shift of dramatisation. Where narrative and personalisation have taken precedent over factual and observational ‘truth’, which has resulted in what some see as a “dumbing down” (Kilborn, 2003: 2) of the genre. This will be applied in context to the six part documentary series Planet Earth II (2016) with reference to Planet Earth (2006) and Frozen Planet (2011). The main issues addressed will be the way truth is deployed and interpreted in the series, as well as how Planet Earth II follows a continuing trend in television documentary of genre blurring. To do this I will be referring to the work of academics Kilborn (1997 / 2003), Austin (2008), Bruzzi (2006), Hall (1978), Hill (2005), Holland (2000), and Storey (2012)\n\nIdeology as a concept is where ideas of one group are articulated to the masses but as storey states, sometimes “texts and practices present distorted images of reality. They produce what is sometimes called false consciousness” (Storey, 2012:3) for their ideological benefit. In the context of documentary ideology can quickly become a conflict of interest as “almost 80 per cent of the public were interested in watching documentary television, and nearly 60 per cent believed documentaries provided accurate information.” (Hill 2005: 59), this implies that the forty percent understand that documentary like any form of media is a take on reality, but the majority still believe that documentary is synonymous with factual. The selection of information already shifts documentary away from being this unbiased, central and factual content many see it as, but in order to engage and speak to the audience many documentarists do dramatise their content. Kilborn and Izod state that “the task of the documentarist is not only to record reality but to give the recorded material a form that allows the resultant film or programme to speak to its audience.” (1997:4) and it’s this definition of documentary that many filmmakers use to justify the convergence of formats to what is now being labelled infotainment.\n\nAt the core of the documentary genre is the pedigree it has historically held as factual content. Not solely to entertain the masses as most popular television and film is fictional, where as documentary has a place in our society to inform and educate. Kilborn asserts however that “Wildlife is becoming just another form of factual entertainment” (2003: 148) due not to the form or presentation but the increasing search for dramatic animal footage such as hunting and fighting. The key features of the genre can be traced back and seen in work such as John Grierson in the 1930s, in his documentary Housing Problems he demonstrates the rigid and formalised modes of address where he commentates over footage of a social issue. As it is aimed at informing citizens in a mass democracy, with a motive behind it of social reform it is undoubtable seen as propaganda. The observational documentary is another form, derived from cinema vértié it is about observing and recording the reality of everyday. However as seen in the work of Fred Wiseman (1968) he placed static cameras in different scenarios, and though it is interesting it doesn’t capture the interest of the audience due to no framing of what is happening. Dai Vaughan’s definition of documentary is pertinent here “What makes a film ‘documentary’ is the way we look at it; and the history of documentary has been the succession of strategies by which film-makers have tried to make viewers look at films this way” (1999: 84). However in the case of Planet Earth II it’s not just the history of documentary but the developments it has had due to the changing nature of film and television making in general. This is the shift to where cinematic and unique directorial film-making has become celebrated, and new ways of presenting a scene to engage an audience rather than just putting a camera somewhere and expecting to have engagement. I believe this is a shift in most television making, but it’s especially potent in documentaries as they have gone from being majorly static to this more personal moving camera.\n\nPlanet Earth II’s first episode was “the most watched natural history programme in the UK for more than 15 years, drawing in 9.2 million viewers” (The Guardian, 2016) This wildlife documentary reached one of the largest audiences, and as such as become a landmark in the wildlife documentary genre. In 2006 what set Planet Earth apart to its predecessors was the focus on creating a cinematic experience. A key example for when documentary, along with many other forms of media has become a hybrid genre of sorts, “the contemporary debate on the blurred boundaries between genres has been ubiquitous,” (Austin, 2008: 147) the main reason for this is how film-making has changed and the generational differences as current filmmakers are the ones who have studied film and as such have personal influences from all sorts of media. Executive Producer of Planet Earth II, Mike Gunton said this about the show’s influence from cinema, “when we go to the cinema the camera is never static, it’s always on the move… And I think we wanted to reflect that in our approach… because the reason why cinema does that is because as soon as you have that sense of moving camera it feels more immersive, it feels more connected” (cited in Vox, 2017 00:33). Which is why Planet Earth II can be labelled as “infotainment” (Kilborn, 2003: 2) due the different underlying intentions of not just to inform and educate the audience, but to immerse them, to engage them, and to entertain them. However, as Kilborn and Izod write “the task of the documentarist is not only to record reality but to give the recorded material a form that allows the resultant film or programme to speak to its audience,” (1997: 4) this gives the claim for Planet Earth II that it is simply following the contemporary trajectory of documentary, as making it cinematic is the form which keeps the audience connected.\n\nThe importance of narrative placed in Planet Earth II is another feature seen in many contemporary documentaries, and as such have to “consider the ethical implications of dramatization” (Austin, 2008: 7). Producer Elizabeth White noted that “we’ve gone for a much more emotional narrative in these, it’s much more trying to put you in their world… taking the viewer on a journey where they can start to relate to how that animal might work in that world. A warmer and closer take on planet earth” (cited in Vox, 2017 05:42), this narrative was achieved by following individual animals very closely to not just see how their species worked, but to create this narrative where the audience relates and empathises with the individual. Prior to Planet Earth, nature documentaries were limited by numerous factors, a major being the technology and as such quickly edited clips of animals was the norm rather than storytelling. However as Austin states the major difference between the narratives seen in cinema to that of documentary is the “symbolic richness” (2008: 21). Yet I believe this isn’t necessary when we look at what Holland claims that “most narrative theories hinge on the creation of a coherent and convincing fictional world, sustained by certain codes of realism” (2000: 121), even though he is discussing about drama and fiction this can be applied to Planet Earth II, as in the same way the audience is shown a version of reality in which they accept as truth due to the editing and framing of the scene. This is what sets this documentary apart from others in the genre in many ways, as rather than simply showing the audience something and letting them interpret it for themselves, Planet Earth II is like a film in which it frames scenes in a specific way, which is also assisted by the voice overs which again may be more important in terms of ideology than the footage itself. Counter to this however is what Gunton states about the wolf hunting scene in the fourth episode, “once that wolf starting hunting you could just fly along, and in one shot you could just see how that drama played out… It was so gripping because it was unmediated,” (cited in Vox, 2017 04:12) so even though sometimes it seems highly edited, other times there is no narration and no cuts. which is why discussing Planet Earth II in absolutes is difficult, as it uses so many different film-making and documentation techniques, to create these different narratives in each episode.\n\nHowever controversy still surrounds these techniques, The Sun for example published the headline, “PLANET OF THE FAKES Planet Earth II viewers blast BBC over fake sound effects” (2016, online). This debate about performance and what is real is something that permeates documentary, many have seen this documentary series as overly dramatic, maybe due to features such as Hans Zimmerman’s soundtrack which is reminiscent of his other works in cinema, notably in the action genre. However as Bruzzi states here, “When one discusses performance and the real event, this fusion has more usually been applied to documentary drama, where a masquerade of spontaneity can be seen to function at an overt level… within such a realist aesthetic, the role of performance is, paradoxically, to draw the audience into the reality of the situations being dramatised, to authenticate the fictionalisation” (2006 :153), this for me is the reason why Zimmerman’s soundtrack and the fast paced editing which goes beside it is there, as it makes the scenes more interesting, and once again keeps the audience interested.\n\nHowever this does led to controversy in some aspects of film-making, for example in spin-off of the series, Frozen Planet, a scene was filmed in a zoo with a recreated ice cave, which was mixed with real arctic shots. The Mirror reported on it with “Frozen Planet Fakery” said, “documentary makers fooled the audience into believing the footage was gathered by intrepid cameramen,” (2011). However the reason as Kilborn states “is the case that filming an animal in the wild might, on occasions, expose the film makers to risk and danger or, alternatively, being such a degree of disturbance to the wildlife environment as to drive animals away from this habitat… There are thus some sound reasons why film makers consider that the inclusion of ‘captive sequences’ in wildlife programming is justifiable” (2003:146). And why that scene was necessary and included in this documentary was to push the message that our ice worlds were melting and the ideological message for us, a “call to action” (Austin, 2008: 7). However Planet Earth II is arguably a lot less ideological, Martin Hughes-Games even criticized the series claiming “these programmes are still made as if this worldwide mass extinction is simply not happening… lulling the huge worldwide audience into a false sense of security” (cited in The Guardian, 2017). This raises an interesting question which is that Planet Earth II is not ideological enough, and after all ideology and pushing a message is “what makes a film documentary… To see a film as documentary is to see its meaning as pertinent to the events and objects which passed before the camera” (Vaughan, 1999: 84–5). It’s arguable that indeed Planet Earth II doesn’t really have a clear ideological message like it’s prequels did. This is even backed up by what Coward said in 1997, “While the spectacular programmes of individual animals and species have flourished, programmes dealing with conservation have slipped in schedules, and environmental issues have been pushed to the margins” (1997: 45). It’s as simple as that, entertainment and dramatisation is what engages the audience and brings in the most viewers. And as such pushing ideological messages of conservation and the propaganda model about the damage of humans, even in a genre like the nature documentary, has taken a become less relevant compared to infotainment.\n\nA final feature of the documentary yet to be mentioned is the primary definer, Sir David Attenborough himself, arguable the most ideological figure in this documentary series. Stuart Hall states primary definers as “constantly turning to accredited representatives of major social institutions — M.Ps for political topics, employers and trade union leaders for industrial matters, and so on,” (1978: 58). Attenborough is an expert in the field, not just a voice actor but actually interested and knowledgeable about nature, and the topics discussed in Planet Earth II. Most of Planet Earth II politically holds a central position, even it’s final episode on cities which has the potential to be extremely critical of the actions of humans, instead focuses on the harmony between the two. However Attenborough still uses the opportunity to be critical, but also more importantly dramatic which is arguably for the sake of infotainment and engagement. In the final episode of the series, he uses indicative and emotive language such as “the alpha must evict every single one of them from his territory” or even when he is talking about an ordinary street light he describes it as “it has become more — and more — powerful,” with a booming voice, dramatic music, and fast time-lapse footage. It can definitively be argued that Attenborough’s role pushes the ideology of the series more than any other element. He also represents the personalisation in the documentary, as the audience not only like him, but have this affinity and trust in what he says. This follows the classic documentary form, with Attenborough’s highly formal modes of address a sort of “voice of God” (Austin, 2008: 55) bestowing his knowledge onto the audience.\n\nTo conclude, for many critics the power of documentary is to report the truth, to expose hidden agendas and ideological malfeasance. However the genre has its origins in educating and informing, and the attempt to speak any truth is always going to be ideological due to what the filmmaker selects and structures it. However what Kilborn states about the nature documentary is undoubtedly the trajectory for the sub genre, “the increasing number of wildlife programs which lure viewers with the promise of action-packed scenes featuring spine-tingling acts of predation and other types of violent encounter,” (Kilborn 2003:148) does relate to Planet Earth II yet this isn’t the only feature in it. The genre blurring; from the personalisation and observational style of the animals, the cinematic camera and directing style, the very Hollywood-like soundtrack, the expositional form guided by voice over from Attenborough as a personality, but finally the editing into a narrative I find to be the most valuable aspect in the documentary. Dramatisation has taken the forefront in documentary, now not just educational but engaging and captivating. Executive Producer Mike Gunton had this to say, “The imagery is of course that first thing that catches the eye catches the attention, but without the revelation the storytelling brings, in the end it falls quite quickly, so no technology will ever replace the ability to tell a story that grips and fascinates and emotional connects with an audience,” (cited in Vox, 07:48). It’s storytelling, not truth, a distortion of how reality is represented, but it undoubtedly captures viewers attentions and makes them feel more attached to animals than arguably any wildlife documentary prior.\n\nOriginally wrote: 17.05.17\n\nBibliography:\n\nAttenborough, D (2006) Planet Earth.
