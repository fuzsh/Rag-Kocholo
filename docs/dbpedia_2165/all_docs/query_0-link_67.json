It is a diverse, fascinating environment that was wonderfully brought to life on the giant screen by the exceptional cinematography of the Arctic team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit, allowing audiences to be transported to this breath-taking environment. At a time when our polar regions are under severe threat, we are incredibly grateful for the recognition of the skill, expertise and endeavour of everyone involved in making this giant screen film”.\n\n“It is a great honour in the Giant Screen filmmaking world to have won in six categories at the 2023 GSCA Achievement Awards.
