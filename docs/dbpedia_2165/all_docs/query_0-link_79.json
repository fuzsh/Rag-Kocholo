        "text": "It is beyond doubt that the release of Frozen planet has triggered anxiety and celebration as a natural history documentary. This can be backed up by the interesting coverage of the documentary which takes the Pavlovian cues and the marvelous dramatic pullback zooms that resemble the production of Planet Earth and Life or the Blue planet.\n\nDavid Attenborough goes from the northern to the southern hemisphere, a distance of 15,000 miles in the coverage of the documentary hence bringing the two geographical regions together in a documentary. He appears on camera other than producing the voice-over, a role that he has played for many years to show the extraordinary dimension of the documentary.\n\nIt is vivid that most of the natural history documentaries never lack “holy shit” that ends up amazing most viewers hence the astounding shots in Frozen planet. Some of these shots include the wolf attacks and lightning attacks that cause death. Nevertheless, I am very pleased by the fact that the documentary does not only specialize in the wild creatures in the cold geographical regions but also focuses on the life of the people who habit such places.\n\nIn the documentary, Attenborough gives his own viewpoint comparing the Antarctic and Arctic. He is not implicit but explicit while showing the peculiar changes that are taking place at the north and south poles and goes further into addressing the creatures that take advantage of environmental changes. He covers the astonishing transformation of the polar geographical areas and leaves it to the viewers to make their own judgment on the causes.\n\nBesides the child stories of “Mother nature’s creation,” the documentary also depicts the unfair and vindictiveness nature of the wild. Shots of the battle between wolves and muskoxen are captured. This does not leave behind the seals and their orca hunting skills.\n\nIt is also fundamental to note that Frozen planet is child-friendly. This means that children find it interesting as it is featured as a cheat for those who are willing to watch the longer version. In addition, one can also decide to watch the complete documentary with an isolated sore of tracks. This can apply in most cases at parties where one plays the documentary in such a way that people think of it as a stereo track play.\n\nThe documentary can be viewed as a unique documentary because it covers a wide range of audiences. This is unlike other television series that do not interest viewers of all ages the same way Frozen planet does. It brings about topics that adults and children can view. For example, parents can sit and watch these vibrant series with their children, unlike some shows that major on children or adult topics that separate the children from their parents.\n\nThis is because what may seem to be interesting to the parents may be boring to the children hence the need for a general topic documentary that both parents and children can watch together. Frozen Planet is also a significant documentary that offers geographical knowledge to students and also general geographic knowledge to the society besides entertainment.\n\nIn conclusion, the documentary ends with its own advert by requesting people to buy a copy of Frozen Planet to experience an awesome view of the planet. The documentary is also depicted as being special unlike other documentaries in the advert as it also promotes the sale of Planet earth and life for the benefit of viewers in learning the geography of the earth. The whole idea of the documentary is therefore to bring a new viewpoint of planet earth into the minds of the viewers."
