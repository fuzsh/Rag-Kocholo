        "text": "So, I went to an advance screening of the first ep of Frozen Planet yesterday morning down at a nearby cinema, and wow!\n\nIf you haven't seen the trailers yet, Frozen Planet is the latest and greatest production from the BBC NHU, following on from Planet Earth, Blue Planet, etc. It features absolutely stunning videography, brilliant music and wonderful stories.\n\nUnlike other NHU productions Frozen Planet does not focus exclusively on animals - it spends almost as much time looking at ice formations, caves, volcanoes etc. Of course there are the animals there, but it's not exclusive! It's not just about climate change though - yes it's there and yes it's mentioned, but it's not rammed down your throat or anything.\n\nAlso features a few people, and has some wonderful 'making of' at the end. Has humorous sequences as well, really great stuff. It's narrated and presented by David Attenborough.\n\nIt's on this Wednesday, BBC1 at 21:00. Check it out and see what you think, and especially for those with HD projectors and surround sound! It really is beautiful!\n\nJust to add, I was told some stats about it (which I can't quite remember!) but it involved 4 years of filming, hundreds (actually hundreds) of dive hours under arctic ice, dozens of sled dogs, some camels, a Royal Navy patrol boat, 2 ice breakers and some other stuff! Annoyed I can't remember it all!\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfl7n\n\nDid anyone have a glitch with the audio at the very beginning?\n\nyep\n\nI saw parts of this last night. Was a shame when the seal gave up\n\nThat poor seal\n\nYeah, the seal part was pretty sad!\n\nLook of resignation straight down the camera, almost as if it knew it was there\n\nLuckiest penguin in the world!\n\nPoor seal tho - very sad to see it just not have the final bit of energy to make it to safety, and the Killer Whale just gently tug it into the sea, to it's death\n\nSame with the Bison - it was probably going to die at the jaws of the wolves anyway, but to be knocked down by another bison... Sad, but thats life in the wild!\n\nI'm watching it in SD (Freeview), so no glorious HD or surround sound for me, but even so, the Beeb have racked up the bit rate for it (as they often do for their flagship nature docs), so it actually looks ok. Must be awesome in HD tho!\n\nThe penguin who kept nicking his neighbours nest material (rocks) - the way he had his back to him, sneakly looking over his shoulder, then hurrying over when he wasent looking - was like watching a pixar short, but much more entertaining .\n\nIt was astonishing.\n\nThe thief clearly understood what was going on in the other's mind and knew when he could steal stones.\n\nI thought that this \"Theory of Mind\" had only ever been observed in higher primates (chimps) ... and even then it is still a matter of some controversy.\n\nRegards\n\nOnly seen last weeks so far, but this is up there with the other BBC nature docs I think. Some of the pictures are stunning IMO. The slow mo with the owl in the gliding through the snow was as good as I have seen in other HD documentaries. The DD sound is awesome as well. When that large ice shelf broke off...... had my sub working like a dream!\n\nHope this weeks lives up to the challenge."
