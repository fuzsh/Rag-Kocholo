        "text": "The AutoNation® IMAX® 3D Theater at the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS) will premiere SK Films and BBC Earth’s documentary, Arctic: Our Frozen Planet, on Friday, May 19. The epic film, narrated by award-winning actor, Benedict Cumberbatch, will take the audience on a yearlong adventure through the seasons in the Arctic while shedding light on the tremendous effects that global warming in the Arctic has on the world.\n\n“We are overjoyed to bring the magical and impactful film, Arctic: Our Frozen Planet, to the Museum,” said Joseph P. Cox, president and CEO of MODS. “As the Hub for Resilience Education, it is critical that we encourage people of all ages to act and mitigate climate change. Sharing this powerful documentary showcases the importance of taking action.”\n\nAudience members will be immersed in the astounding world of narwhals, belugas and polar bears as they navigate ice floes. Hear the thunderous sound of stampeding caribou and muskox trying to escape hungry wolves. Be amazed by hooded seals that blow up red balloons and ice-covered bumblebees that emerge gloriously from their winter lairs and learn that as the planet’s climate is experiencing rapid changes, so is the Arctic.\n\n“We set out to make a film that celebrates, first and foremost, the wonder and magic of the Arctic and the incredibly diverse life that survives and thrives there. We also wanted giant screen audiences to understand how deeply connected to the Arctic region we are and how we depend on it.” states Jonathan Williams, executive producer and head of commercial, BBC Earth.\n\nWendy MacKeigan, CEO SK Films, says, “We’re so excited by the breathtaking cinematography and never-seen-before footage which are the trademarks of BBC Studios Natural History Unit. The world-renowned actor Benedict Cumberbatch has superbly narrated this film. His passion for this unique environment and for the future of our planet resonates with every word. The immersive IMAX medium and giant screen enhance the viewer experience of the vast landscape, the indigenous people, and the wildlife in Arctic: Our Frozen Planet.”\n\nTo view the trailer and learn more about the film, please visit thearcticfilm.com."
