The astonishing diversity of life on earth depends on these global connections.\n\nFrozen Worlds\n\nOur poles are some of the earth's last remaining wildernesses. And yet just as we are beginning to understand these extraordinary places, they are changing fast.\n\nJungles\n\nIn jungles, everywhere is special. Host to a staggering array of species, they are the oldest and most diverse ecosystems on our planet.\n\nForests\n\nWe are uniquely reliant on trees – without them, life as we know it would not exist. We’ve exploited our forests through the ages, but if we give them the chance, they will bounce back.\n\nForests\n\nWe are uniquely reliant on trees – without them, life as we know it would not exist. We’ve exploited our forests through the ages, but if we give them the chance, they will bounce back.\n\nGrasslands\n\nOur planet’s grasslands are the rich home to our big land animals, but they’re also shrinking. Life in our grasslands depends on space.\n\nFresh Water\n\nWithout fresh water, life on land wouldn't exist. It is the most precious resource on our planet, but it's finite. Every drop is vital for all species and us humans that rely upon it.\n\nFresh Water\n\nWithout fresh water, life on land wouldn't exist.

Traversed by whales, sharks, turtles, tuna and albatross and home to mysterious deep-sea creatures, these are the true wilds of our planet."
