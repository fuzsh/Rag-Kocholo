        "text": "Expectations are high when David Attenborough and the BBC Natural History Unit get together. Beginning with “Life on Earth” in 1979, they have set the standard for plush nature shows studded with arresting moments, and their latest, the seven-episode “Frozen Planet” (beginning on Sunday on Discovery), has its share of spine-tinglers.\n\nAmong the things you’ll see in “Frozen Planet” that you haven’t seen before, perhaps the most striking is a blitzkrieg attack by a quartet of killer whales on a seal perched safely atop a large chunk of Antarctic ice. Swimming in perfect side-by-side formation, the orcas pass under the ice and thrash their tails in unison at just the right moment, creating a mini-tsunami that washes the unfortunate seal into the water. At Sea World, this would be worth a lot of fish meal.\n\nSwitching back and forth between the Antarctic and the Arctic, the “Frozen Planet” camera crews — who spent four years braving blizzards, shifting ice floes, angry leopard seals and subfreezing ocean dives — captured other stunning images through the usual combination of talent, superior technology, endurance and dumb luck.\n\nTime-lapse photography shows an underwater stalactite of ice quickly descending to the ocean floor, where it spreads and freezes alive any creature too slow to get out of its path. Similar sequences, on a larger scale, show glaciers moving, rivers thawing and the Greenland ice sheet melting in the spring. Lovely momentary images abound: a seal appearing in a wave like a ghost, seeming to float above the heads of the penguins watching it from the shore; the Antarctic sea ice, looking like a colorful abstract painting because of the dead marine creatures pinned underneath it.\n\nThese images will stick with you. But so will an overall sense that “Frozen Planet” is more — a lot more — of the same: an aestheticized, sentimentalized, anthropomorphic abstraction of the natural world, in which gentle soundtrack music, winsome narration (by Alec Baldwin, replacing Mr. Attenborough for most of the American version) and the judicious use of slow motion combine to put us in a pleasant stupor on the couch.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
