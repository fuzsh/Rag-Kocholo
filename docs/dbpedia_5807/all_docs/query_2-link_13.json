Terms, $2.00 a year. 50 cents a number. Back numbers, as far as they can be supplied, 30 cents each, 1897-1913; 50 cents each, 1914- Volumes 1-6 consist of ten numbers, vol. 7, of 7 numbers, with title and index.

Correspondence concerning the BULLETIN is solicited, and lists or articles suitable for publication are desired. Address The Boston Book Company, 83-91 Francis St., Fenway, Boston, Mass. EDITORIAL COMMENT HAPPY NEW YEAR The Bulletin of Bibliography wishes all its readers a most pleasant and prosperous New Year. The Boston Book Company extends the season's greetings to all its customers and hopes to merit their orders during the coming twelvemonth. THE NEW SERIES OF THE BULLETIN With this issue we appear in a new cover, and with the page trimmed slightly, so the magazine can be shelved on ordinary shelves. Inside, however, is the greater change, — the addition of two new features, which we hope will be acceptable, especially to the smaller libraries. The series of Portraits of Librarians and Biblio- graphers, which here begins with Justin Winsor, the first president of the American Library Associa- tion, and the new department of Applied Library Economy in which we hope in each issue to describe one phase of one library's work, and to give a series of \" Useful hints\" on as broad a variety of subjects as possible. Contributions to this department are solicited if you have some useful method, or some short-cut that would interest others. Perhaps you have a better way of handling some of the problems which this issue mentions? Write us, and make this new department a forum for the exchange of ideas. INDEX TO REFERENCE LISTS, 1913 We give in this issue, in addition to the regular departments, the Annual Index to Reference Lists published in Library Bulletins. This will be especially useful to smaller libraries. Copies of the Bulletins noted may usually be had if stamps for their mailing are sent to the library issuing them. SWEDISH BOOK TERMS Another of Mr. Axel Moth's compilations — Swed- ish book and printing terms — is begun in this issue. NEW BOOKS We have in press, by Mr. J. B. Kaiser, an exhaustive manual on \"Law, Legislative and Municipal Reference Libraries, which with its appendices and index will make a work of over 400 pages, the first to cover this field, now so much in the forefront of recent library progress. The Dramatic Index for 1913, and the Magazine Subject Index for 1913 are well under way, and should be ready by the end of February. Several new peri- odicals have been indexed. MAGAZINE NOTES Our old friend the English Illustrated Magazine is no more; August, 1913, was the final issue. The rush of magazine publishers to increase the size of their magazines goes merrily on: Book News Monthly for November, volume 32, no. 3, appears as a quarto with this naive statement: \"The greatest blunder that people who do things can make in the present day is to contribute to the general monotony of life,\" and later, \"We wish to give its exterior the same note of freshness that typi- fies its contents.\" Let us hope freshness will not demand more changes in the middle of a volume. Pity the poor binders ! Independent became quarto in size with the issue of October 2d, 1913. \"New in appearance, but old in spirit; modified only to meet the changing condi- tions of new times.\" The new size begins vol. 76, the publishers having had the foresight abruptly to terminate vol. 75, and thus avoid possibility of any new suicides among the binders. New York Teachers Monographs becomes a quarto with Oct. 1913, vol. 16, no. 1, and changes its name to \"Teachers Monographs of the Public Schools.\" No comment appears in this issue con- cerning the changes made. Moody s Magazine, formerly octavo, became quarto in size with the July 1913 issue, vol. 16, no. 1, and has thus also joined the rapidly increasing list of quartos of which American Magazine, Metropolitan, Chautauquan, and Survey are also members. New York Libraries, issues, with its November number, an index to vols. 1-3, making that useful periodical easily available for reference. The Journal of the American Chemical Society will absorb The American Chemical Journal beginning with 1914 issues. We have received the first issues of Journal of Agricultural Research (vol. 1, no. 1, Oct. 10, 1913), published by the Department of Agriculture, Wash- ington, and of The Psychoanalytic Review, a journal devoted to an understanding of human conduct (vol. 1, no. 1, Nov. 1913), published quarterly at $5.00 a year by the Journal of nervous and mental disease publishing Co., Lancaster, Pa. Bulletin of Bibliography Vol. 8. No. 1 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF LIBRARIANS AND BIBLIOGRAPHERS JUSTIN WINSOR, 1831-1897 Among the eminent men who laid the foundations, broad and deep, of the modern library movement in this country, Justin Winsor holds an exceptionally distinguished place. He was born in Boston, Jan. 2, 1831, and died in Cambridge, Oct. 22, 1897; he was deeply interested in books all his life; and the last thirty years of his life were intimately associated with library work. A man who served as the first President of the American Library Association, and who also served, in turn, as the chief executive officer of two such important libraries as the Boston Public Library and the Harvard University Library, could hardly have lacked some elements of distinction, in any case, but Mr. Winsor's personality was such that his distinction would inevitably be due less to the positions which he might hold, at one time or another, than to his own inherent qualities and characteristics. As more than one student of Mr. Winsor's career has observed, there are few men of his time who have united in their own persons so exceptional an equip- ment of scholarly tastes and accomplishments with so exceptional a capacity for administration. His natural endowments were well supplemented by his early training. Born in Boston, of an ancestry linked for successive generations with the history of the Plymouth Colony, he profited both by the thorough training of the Boston Latin School, and by that of Harvard College. After entering college, however, he was attracted, after a year or two, by a welcome opportunity of going directly to Europe, where he pursued his studies, at Paris and at Heidel- berg. Although not graduating with his class, in 1853, Harvard University later granted him the degree of Bachelor of Arts, as of the class of 1853. It is natural to conceive of Mr. Winsor, after all these years, as essentially a specialist in history. While this is true, he was a man of so wide interests that an attempt to \"label\" him too specifically would surely be misleading. It is well known that one of the unrealized aims of his life was the publication of a Life of Garrick, for which he had accumulated a large amount of material; and on such recondite subjects as the bibliography of the Shakespeare quartos and folios, few men on this side of the Atlantic were so completely at home. Mr. Winsor came naturally by his strong bent for history, however, having very early begun the collection of materials for his \"History of Duxbury, Mass.,\" which was published in 1849. A note- worthy volume of his which appeared in 1880 was entitled \"The reader's handbook of the American Revolution.\" Under his editorship, there were issued in the years 1880-82 the four noble volumes of the \"Memorial history of Boston.\" This was one of the earliest instances (as it is, to this day, one of the most conspicuously successful,) of co-operation on a large scale, in historical work, under the direction of a single mind. The reception given to this notable work led naturally to Mr. Winsor's other great work of a similar nature, \"The narrative and critical history of America,\" the eight volumes of which were published in the years 1884 to 1889. A notice- able feature of the latter work is the very unusual bibliographical equipment supplied with each chapter, usually from the hand of the editor, Mr. Winsor. Four other substantial contributions to American history, from his pen, appeared within the next eight years, namely, \"Christopher Columbus,\" \"Cartier to Frontenac,\" \"The Mississippi Basin,\" and \"The Westward Movement.\" The volume last named was completed only a short time before his death, in 1897. Mr. Winsor also gave much care and pains to the editing and publication of the \"Record of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Harvard College, 1886,\" published in 1887. In his mastery of geographi- cal studies and the digesting of the information supplied by early maps, Mr. Winsor occupied a position where he had few rivals; and his labors in this field have had a marked influence on subsequent researches in American history. It is interesting to notice that Mr. Winsor's en- trance into the librarian's profession, like that of some other eminent librarians, was through the gateway — so to speak — of service on the governing board of a library. He became a member of the Board of Trustees of the Boston Public Library in 1866, and was chosen Superintendent in 1868. One of the first fruits of his vigorous administration of the Boston Public Library was the publication of the very welcome and practically useful guides for readers, which made the work of that library widely known. These included not only special annotated lists under the head of history and other subjects, but detailed lists of references, appended to the quarterly bulletins. Some of the latter were expanded later into the volume already mentioned, entitled \"The reader's handbook of the American Revolution\" ; and in the \"Preface\" to this book he has summed up the underlying principles, as follows: \"I wish the user of this Handbook to understand its purpose and limitations. It is like a continuous foot-note to all histories of the American Revolution.\" \"I believe it a part of the duty of a public librarian to induce reading and gently to guide it, as far as he can, because I know that as a rule there is much need of such inducement and of such guidance. I am no great advocate of courses of reading. It often matters little what the line of reading is, provided it is pur- sued, as sciences are most satisfactorily pursued, in a comparative way. The reciprocal influences, the broadening effect, the quickened interest arising from a comparison of sources and authorities, I hold to be marked benefits from such a habit of reading.\" Mr. Winsor remained at the head of the Boston Public Library from 1868 to 1877; and then followed the twenty years, crowded with skilful service, not only to undergraduates, but to a wider public, in which he acted as Librarian of the Harvard University Library, from 1877 to 1897. Of the men who were pre-eminently leaders in the American library movement, one may well say of each one of them, (as Mark Antony said of Brutus,) that \"the elements were so mix'd in him\" as to call for admiration and gratitude, but these \"ele- ments\" were mixed in noticeably varied proportions. In one, enthusiasm was plainly predominant. In another, insight was the conspicuous element. In Jan., 1914 Department of Applied Library Economy Mr. Winsor the predominating quality was sanity of judgment. Chosen President of the American Library Association, at its beginning, in 1876, he served with distinguished ability until 1885, leaving on all its proceedings the impress of his strong per- sonality and his organizing mind. No account of Mr. Winsor would be complete without some reference to the influence which he exerted, both consciously and otherwise, on the younger men who were brought more or less closely in connection with him. To quote from what the present writer has said of Mr. Winsor, in another connection, — \"He had that higher faculty, possessed by only the greater teachers, of inevitably setting the principles themselves in such relations that they, and not the teacher, seem to compel the pupil to their adoption.\" William E. Foster. DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED LIBRARY ECONOMY I. SOMERVILLE'S REFERENCE WORK II. HELPFUL HINTS The Editor requests contributions for this new department of the BULLETIN, whether articles of a page or more on some phase of one library's work or paragraphs for the \" Helpful Hints.'' Possible improvements on any hints given will be printed, provided they have actually been tried. REFERENCE WORK IN THE SOMERVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY What are reference books? All books are refer- ence books in the broader sense of the word ; they are different in degree, not in kind, from other books. The present organization of the reference department of the Somerville Library is intended to prove this statement. terms, the shelf arrangement was next considered. How could the most extensive use by the public be assured? How could the staff be made to realize that any book may be useful in reference work? A separate reference room would be decidedly antago- nistic to this idea. The book room of the new build- CITY OF SOMERVILLE— PUBLIC LIBRARY Special Loan of Reference or other Restricted Books I have tkts day received Author the Library Title 191. Number within..

Reference and information work has at least three different aspects: social, the effort to create the proper atmosphere, guidance in the choice of light reading; serious research; and suggestive and instructive work. In the light of this interpretation, every member of the staff who meets the users of the library has a share in reference work. The first step in the reorganization was to select the reference books. Taking Kroeger as a basis, only books distinctly reference in form were included in the new selection. At least one half of the old reference collection was made circulating, shelved either in the Book Room or stack. With the reference collection reduced to its lowest ing, containing about 40,000 volumes, the working collection of the library, is arranged on the alcove plan. If the reference books on scientific and techni- cal subjects could be placed in the alcoves with the circulating books on these subjects, they would not be overlooked by the public. For this reason, the collection was divided into \"Reference,\" or, those treating of general and miscellaneous subjects, and \"Alcove reference,\" or, those dealing with specific subjects. The \"Reference\" books are shelved in one alcove near the information desk as a hub or cfcnter. \"Alcove reference\" are placed in the alcoves at the beginning of their subjects — classification being by the Dewey decimal. So arranged, all the 600 alcove reference books are at the beginning of the useful arts in the Book Room. Besides bringing these books Bulletin of Bibliography Vol. 8, No. 1 before the public, this method obliges the staff to consult the section, where practically all the library resources on a given subject are shelved. A natural criticism of the scheme is that people will wish to take out alcove reference books. Would that be entirely objectionable? Reference books might well circulate for limited periods. To permit this a special \"limited loan\" form was devised, bound in books of fifty; on the stub the borrower's name and data are filled in, and also on the \"tear-off,\" which is two by five inches to file in the tray of book-cards. The reference books have neither book cards or pockets, but are provided with dating slips. When the book is returned, the slip is taken from the time tray and filed for statistical purposes, the entry can- celled on the stub in the reference charging book, and the book returned to the shelf. The decision in each individual case as to whether the book shall circulate, and if so, the time of circulation, is left to the person in charge. Many of the details of the scheme may be revised to meet conditions, but the motive purpose of central- izing and socializing reference work in the public library is certainly of permanent value. M. W. HELPFUL HINTS 'Novel Notes. Generally speaking, all fiction is ordered by this Library on approval. Each book upon receipt is assigned to a member of the Library staff for review. This novel-reading is wholly voluntary, and is done outside of Library time. When a book is approved for acceptance, a note is made by the reviewer accord- ing to the following plan: Scene and time. Subject. Treatment. Recommend to ? These notes are typewritten, inserted in a loose- leaf note-book and kept in the Circulating Depart- ment for ready reference on the part of the staff. Borrowers may not have direct access to the \"Novel Notes,\" but the members of the Circulating Depart- ment employ them constantly to assist borrowers in their choice of reading. Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn. Filing Current Periodicals. A method of keeping current numbers of periodicals in the reading room is to treat them like books on shelves with the backs only showing. This involves placing the periodicals in temporary binders of some kind, with name on the back. It is also well to divide the shelves into sections perhaps a foot wide by par- titions. The saving in space over the common method of displaying periodicals broadside is very great, as well as saving of expense of a periodical case often- times. The periodicals may be arranged in three series according to height, with distances between shelves of about 12, 15 and 20 or more inches for the three heights. New Haven Public Library. Large Weeklies Without Binding. All back numbers of technical periodicals indexed in the Engineering Index are kept. Some are bound, others, principally the large weeklies, are cared for as follows : Advertising pages are removed, and the numbers for one month are sewed through three holes stabbed along the back. A piece of bond paper two inches wide is folded to make a hinge and pasted on edge of front and back page over sewing. To these hinges are pasted covers from one of the numbers. A strip of book cloth is then pasted on the back, extending about half an inch over the sides and on this is printed title and date. The same method is used for monthly periodicals, three months making a volume. Free Public Library, Newark, N. J. Reserve Fiction. In order that a borrower may not be obliged to leave a post card to secure a work of recent fiction. half of the number of copies of such a work are placed on the open shelves for general circulation. The other half, which may be reserved, bear the letter R in red ink on the 7 day label and book pocket. Cambridge Public Library. Improved Book Supports. Libraries having steel shelving might do well to inquire of the makers whether they cannot furnish more satisfactory book supports than what are generally used. The New Haven Public Library has a very satisfactory support furnished by the makers of the stack, which fits in the turned front edge of the shelf, is easily put in place, easily moved and perfectly firm in use, and without the thin edge which invites the injury of books inadvertently pushed over it by the public. It is quite likely that the manufacturers of steel stacks can furnish satis- factory supports if the demand is made for them. The support used in this library is not of my in- vention and I have no interest in the matter except to wish that all libraries may have a satisfactory book-support. Willis K. Stetson. Inexpensive Book Supports. The New Bedford Public Library uses bricksf or book supports, but instead of covering them as so many have done in the past, paste-board boxes of grey color are used. These little boxes, the covers of which are just as deep as the boxes themselves, are just the size of a brick. They cost $8.75 for 500, and the cheapest sort of bricks costing $11.50 a thousand are used. \"Banners\" instead of \"Dummies\". Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn. Through the first floor of the Circulating department (the open shelves) banners are used instead of dummies for representing all circulating classed books shelved elsewhere. Duplicates of circulating books which may be found in the Reference departments are also noted in this way. The \"banners\" are hung at the end of the stacks containing books with the corresponding class numbers. These banners are 27 inches long by 7 inches wide. They are made of binder's board covered with binder's cloth, and, on the principle of the postal card album, each banner allows for the insertion of seven cards. The cards used are L. B. 33 size cards; light weight; commercial ruling; buff; without punch. The class numbers, each noted but once, are entered in large figures to the left of the cards. The book numbers, with location letter written above, are placed well apart to allow room for inserting new numbers when necessary. \"Processions\" of New Books. In the Yale University Library, new books received are dated and shelved by themselves, arranged under Jan., 1914 Reading List on Eugene Brieux some 26 separate subjects — a shelf being allowed for each. After one month's exhibition, during which the professors and others interested have examined I and gotten acquainted with them, the books take I their regular places in the stack. In each division ' these books, while on view, are shelved in order of receipt, so that the right end volumes are the newest, j and the left end volumes are constantly being re- 1 moved to stack as the thirty-day period expires. Binding Pointers. 1. In binding periodicals never use leather unless the volumes are to be constantly used. 2. All books should have French joints. 3. It is never wise to stitch sections lengthwise by machine and then sew by hand. Modern methods of overcasting are much preferable. Wilmington Institute Free Library. Art Exhibits. \"I wonder why more libraries that have the means, do not take advantage of the opportunities given by the American Federation of Arts, Washington, D.C., which loans exhibitions of paintings at the bare ex- pense of transportation one way, and a proportionate expense of insurance, boxing, etc. We have had several of these exhibitions and they are extremely satisfac- tory.\"— George H, Tripp, New Bedford Public Library. Exhibits of Photographs. In the Hartford Public Library, strips of picture moulding placed horizontally from one to two feet apart, at convenient height, are used for supporting exhibits of mounted pictures and photographs. The mounts are held in place by the little tin clips, which hang onto the moulding, and are thus given a rigid support, much better than cords give, no matter how tightly stretched. An Inexpensive Record Blank-Book. A useful blank-book is one used by teachers called a roll-book, and found at stationers. It has vertical columns for the days of the month, but no printing. It is useful for entering receipt of current periodicals, also^ has sufficient number of columns for all the Decimal classes, both adult and juvenile, hence circulation records, and any other records according to classification can easily be kept with a minimum of trouble, and the cost of the blank books is small. — Willis K. Stetson, New Haven Public Library. To Induce Needed Appropriations or Gifts. Surrounding a placard reading, \"What we need\", one library posts the beautiful series of exterior and interior views of the Denver branch libraries, recently sent out by the librarian. Here is an idea worth copying where branches are wanted. Seen at Hart- ford Public Library. Paper Towel Rolls. Most libraries as well as other public buildings, place the rolls of paper towels so high that in reaching for them the drip from the wet hand runs up the sleeve. Towels should be elbow high.

WoodrufE, Pratt Institute Free Library, Brooklyn, N. Y. EUGfiNE BRIEUX. Eugdne Brieux, the son of a carpenter, was born in Paris, on the 19th of January, 1858. To his humble as- sociations and surroundings in youth and early manhood is undoubtedly due his understanding and appreciation of working-class character, shown in many of his dramatic studies. Having failed in his early efforts to make a living by his pen in Paris he removed to Rouen where he joined the staff of The Nouvelliste de Rouen later becoming its editor-in-chief. It was while he was engaged in editorial work that his first plays were written and unsuccessfully offered to various managers. The tide finally turned with the production of Menages d' Artistes by Antoine at the Theatre Libre. Two of his plays, L'Evasion and La Robe Rouge, have been crowned by the French Academy. In 1909 Brieux was elected to the chair of Hal^vy in the Academy. All of his plays \"are essentially didactic, being aimed at some weakness or iniquity of the social system.\" A list in chronological order follows: Bernard Palissy (1879) in collaboration with M. Gas- ton Salandri; Menaged' artistes (1890); Blanchette (1892) ; M. de Reboval (1892); L'engrenage (1894); Leshienfaiteurs (1896); V evasion (1896); Les trois files de M. Dupont (1897); Le risultat des courses, (1898); Simone, (1898); Leber ceau, (1899); La robe rouge, (1900); Les remplacantes, (1901); Les avariis, (1901); La petite amie, (1902); La couvie, (1903); acted privately at Rouen, (1893); Maternite, (1903); La deserteuse (1904), in collaboration with M. Jean Sigaux; Uarmature, (1905); Les hannetons (1906); La Francaise (1907); La foi (1909); Suzette (1909); Lafemme seule (1912). There are slight disagreements in dates given in various lists. Those used have been taken from the Encyclo- pedia Britannica up to the year 1906. Later ones have been found in the article by Temple Scott in the forty- seventh volume of the Forum and more recent magazine articles. WRITINGS.

He does not expose himself to the suspicion of seeking notoriety for the sake of profit by the means of cheap sensationalism, although, in his zeal to demonstrate his case, he is often guilty of some of the most flagrant tricks of sensa- tionalism, such as violent exaggeration, illogical deduction of general results from specific instances, the excessive use of coincidence, the employment of unnecessary grossness, both of speech and incident.\" Nation.
