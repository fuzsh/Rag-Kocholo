He argued that the emergence of a middle class challenged both the city fathers and the Prussian state.2 He believed that “even a child of the revolution could not deny that the city council was his mother,” and he encouraged “the community of citizens” to make this new council, with the Magistrat, the lone municipal authority and the expression of the Berliners’ general will. For Gneist, the city council represented the “basic conditions of a constitutional monarchy.”3 Legal historian Andreas Heusler argued in 1872 that municipal administration generated the “free Bürgertum” and “civic liberty,” which were “the basis of the modern nature of the state.”4 A similar liberal world view shaped areas distant from politics and economics. The city planner Gustav von Rössler wrote in 1874 that abstract legal norms in city planning – such as the height of buildings and the width of streets – created the foundation for freedom: a gridwork of roads would “preserve the freedom [of the owner] to use his property” and create reliable, consistent size and shape of plots of land.5 Under these conditions, real estate was measured against every other plot on the market or potentially on the market, so, Rössler contended, when a property owner sought to develop his or her property, and “without any intervention of the city or state,” building plots could\n\n4\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nbe brought to market, and “unrestricted competition” could regulate land prices.6 In both municipal administration and city planning in the mid-­nineteenth century, liberal assumptions and world views pervaded the understanding of urban life. Furthermore, contemporaries believed that this liberalism was merely an expression of a natural state of affairs, of nature freed from the fetters of privilege and superstition. By the 1920s this liberal world view was gone. In its place one finds a corporatist outlook that fused organic and mechanistic metaphors to grasp urban life and that focused on coordinating the totality of the population. Comparing social theorist and Berliner Georg Simmel’s descriptions of urban bustle in 1903 to the visions of urban life put forward in films such as Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, both from 1927, clarifies this vision.7 Simmel wrote, “Thus the metropolitan type – which naturally takes on a thousand individual modifications – creates a protective organ for itself against the profound disruption with which the fluctuations and discontinuities of the external milieu threaten it.”8 The depiction of a bustling and industrial Berlin in Ruttmann’s film, however, is symphonic, in that while it certainly is complex, it is highly organized and carefully structured. The extensive imagery of machines in the first act gives one a strong sense that Ruttmann viewed the movement of Berliners in the same way, as parts in one vast and complex but ultimately orderly machine. In the metropolis of Lang’s film, the city has no money, market, or civil society, all of which are traditional components of a more abstract vision of a city and are key to liberal understandings of the city. (They played a central role in the mental life of a metropolitan, for example.) Lang’s vision of a future city comprised only oppressed workers, parasitic and indulgent factory owners, and the unpredictable and potentially corrupting engineer. Lang’s city is a massive factory, but it produces no commodities for the market; it just keeps the rest of the city functioning. This book is an urban-­environmental and intellectual history of the appearance, function, and perceptions of Greater Berlin that examines how historical actors understood and responded to challenges of the built environment and regional government of Greater Berlin between 1871 and 1933. Its central focus, however, is the period between roughly 1900 and 1933, to which the nineteenth century provides a necessary prehistory. For many, the metropolitan region of Greater Berlin drew together modern social and cultural problems, creating an intensified crisis: rapid industrialization, working-­class radicalism, dramatic population growth, poor-­quality housing, and\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n5\n\nregional administrative incoherence. This book focuses on Greater Berlin because the transformations that occurred in the late-­nineteenth and early twentieth-­century Greater Berlin were acute. This book argues that a significant change in the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin occurred in this period. This change took place across many ostensibly separate disciplines, including forest preservation, city planning, jurisprudence, and municipal administration. Nonetheless, a pattern appears in the way these disciplines shifted. In the 1870s they were largely liberal, but by the 1930s they had become corporatist. The changes in Greater Berlin share many common elements with other industrial cities throughout the world. However, a more traditional empiricist study or discourse analysis will not fully grasp this transformation. Therefore, this book offers both a new, synthetic methodology and a theory for understanding urban transformations in the period that is the central focus of the book, but also in other periods as well. This book holds that a methodology and a theory should be developed simultaneously and through an examination of the research object. Both the method and the theory will be introduced in what follows and unfolded in full in the body of the book. This book will contribute as much if not more to theories of urbanism as it will to the history of Greater Berlin. From the beginning of the Kaiserreich in 1871 to the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, the form, function, and perception of the city of Greater Berlin were transformed in discourses on city planning and municipal administration. This transformation from a city constituted through liberal social forms to one organized along “corporatist” social forms was dialectical and, as such, it was not smooth or teleological. At the level of the metropolitan region, during this period, the condition of Greater Berlin structured the theory and practice of city planners, municipal administrators, and concerned citizens, giving rise to a wide variety of attitudes from the sanguine to the pessimistic. The regional social transformations, such as rapid urbanization, population growth, inadequate housing, working-­ class radicalism, and administrative incoherence, gave rise to a variety of cultural responses, which, in turn, shaped the social transformation. This transformation, in its regional form, was also mediated by national processes that were the dialectical consequence of the shift from liberal to corporatist social forms. These processes include the failure of liberalism, the rise of socialism, the First World War, the November 1918 Revolution, the hyperinflation of 1921–3, the Great Depression, and the rise of fascism.\n\n6\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, German municipal administration expanded its autonomy and expanded its liberal political structure, notwithstanding the persistence of the conservative Prussian bureaucracy. Across this period, industrialization slowly undermined the basis of this autonomy. Social conflict, expanding welfare services, and geographic-­economic influence and integration all became focused on cities. These urban issues attracted the attention of the higher levels of government. In this same period, a form of city planning developed that was structured around basic ideas of liberal political economy and politics. The planners understood the principles of liberalism to be the natural and rational response to the demands of the city developing these ideas, even though they were not necessarily liberal in an overtly political sense. This liberal city-­planning framework was undermined by industrialization and urbanization in Greater Berlin. The ideas about abstract equality so central to a liberal understanding of the world were challenged by the concrete consequences of liberal city planning, politics, and economics. Liberals had predicted that the freedom of the market and of the private property holder would create the conditions of possibility in the built environment for a just society; however, that did not happen. Liberals were forced by the poor-­quality housing, monopoly of real-­estate property ownership, inefficient (from the point of view of capitalism) layout of the city, poor hygienic conditions, and the absence of green space to reconsider their previous ideals. They began to advocate addressing the spatial consequences of capitalism through intervention in the functioning of the market and private property. Liberal city planning and municipal self-­administration were weakened by these conditions, but these liberal social forms were metamorphosed by the First World War and the November 1918 Revolution. Tendencies inherent in the Kaiserreich were accentuated by the war and revolution, but the war and revolution altered these tendencies. In the war economy, the market and liberalism more generally appeared to capitalists to be impediments to efficiency. A new ideology forced city planning and municipal administration to emphasize a new cohesive character of the society and on expanding the territory of planning. The social transformation brought about by revolution shifted to emphasize a planned, unified, productive society, especially with regard to housing. Finally, the war economy demanded new institutions, which, in turn, created new possibilities for the unification of Greater Berlin into\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n7\n\na single city. While the liberal mode of planning and administration valued individual autonomy, abstract law, private property, and rational self-­interest, this new corporatist mode of planning emphasized the integration of the individual into the collective, rule by decree, expropriation of private property, and planning for the social totality. By the 1920s new theories and practices of city planning and municipal administration were established that valued social integration and greater state intervention in urban administration and the economy. During the Weimar Republic, Berlin’s city planning and municipal administration was shaped by an expanded territory for planning, a shortage of capital, the politics of birth rates and living space, and a new aesthetic that emphasized form that followed function and productivity. In the discourses of city planning and municipal administration, Germany’s well-­being and power were connected to the productivity of the nation and the productive dimensions of capitalism. In particular, these discourses emphasized a belief that new spatial arrangements could remove the perceived fetters on production. While particularly articulated in city planning, architecture, and municipal administration, this shift in social forms pervaded the society. It extended beyond obviously political or economic realms, to the law (e.g., it affected the legal definition of a municipality), the social relevance of city parks, architectural aesthetics, and the function of working-­class homes. This transformation in social patterns is linked to larger changes in the nature of capitalist modernity. The sections of this introduction that follow have several goals: The book will develop a critical analysis of the ways that others have understood the key categories of this history, such as liberalism and corporatism. It will provide context for the relationships between society, politics, culture, and capitalism in the era that this book analyses. It will engage critically with the historiography in order to demonstrate its shortcomings, but more importantly, to justify the turn to social theory that this book makes, and it will expose the ways that the prevailing literature is structured by a series of antinomies. It will then begin to propose a way of considering changing forms of urbanization and the perception of urbanization that sees these practical and ideological dimensions as intrinsically related and root the changes in a theory of capitalist modernity. Finally, it seeks, retrospectively, to suggest the ways that the prevailing literature itself is shaped by the historically specific logic of capitalism.\n\n8\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nLiberalism and Corporatism A shift from a liberal to a corporatist appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin occurred between 1871 and 1933. To develop adequate concepts of liberalism and corporatism, this introduction will examine the dominant ways of understanding these categories. Furthermore, understanding liberalism and corporatism as social forms and the transition from one set of forms to the other requires a more abstract, theoretical lens than is common in the historiography. In his classic essay on German urban liberalism, James Sheehan argues that in 1850, liberalism shaped urban life from politics, to economics, to the public sphere.9 However, by the 1870s the liberal advance was halted, and liberal reforms inadvertently created right-­and left-­wing radicals and a society where liberal ideas no longer seemed adequate.10 In response, liberals found refuge in local politics, where they defended undemocratic measures that assured their privileges.11 Liberal ideas were taken for granted to such an extent that a liberal urban policy could be seen as unpolitical.12 Sheehan’s concern for social relations and political economy, on the one hand, and the conditions of possibility of liberal politics, on the other hand, is valuable, though Sheehan does not sufficiently mediate between levels of abstraction. Responding to this inadequacy in Sheehan’s work and believing that Sheehan regarded German urban liberals as unpolitical, Jan Palmowski sets out to debunk the idea that liberals in Frankfurt were apolitical. Seeking to avoid the problems of mediation that affected Sheehan and deeming that synthetic analysis of the form or timing of those politics in other cities and general arguments about urban liberalism mask key differentiating details, Palmowski rejects the feasibility of such efforts.13 This book, however, will argue that a synthetic analysis that works at a higher level of abstraction and generality, but that does not lose the fine-­grained detail that Palmowski emphasizes, is possible, and for certain key insights, necessary. The Sonderweg or German “special path” historiography of liberalism, of which Sheehan is an example, made a valuable contribution to addressing social relations and political economy, on the one hand, and the conditions of possibility of liberal politics, on the other hand. This literature is often dismissed as teleological by the historiography of German liberalism. However, it does attempt to connect politics and ideology more broadly to the social relations and political economy within which those ideas function. Furthermore, it attempts to develop\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n9\n\nan analysis of why liberalism stopped being an effective ideology whose explanation reaches beyond a series of contingent events. According to the Sonderweg, after 1873 the grounds for the existence of liberalism were eroding. The Sonderweg attempts to explain this growth of governmental responsibilities and their relationship to transformations in capitalism. Importantly, it emphasizes that, while liberals regarded their market-­based social order as an “inevitable result of quasi-­natural laws,” in fact liberalism was a historically specific phase of capitalism. Furthermore, according to this approach, the state and the economy constituted and changed each other as the state responded to economic turbulence with counter-­cyclical measures.14 For Sonderweg historians, the inner dynamic of liberalism concentrated ownership and undermined the social basis for that liberalism, as businesses pressured the state to increase state economic regulations and used liberal social forms such as contracts and private-­sphere associations to develop illiberal defensive cartels and syndicates.15 In the place of liberalism, “organized capitalism” developed, wherein the increasing concentration of capital, especially into the hands of the large banks, and the interventions of the state made it possible to pacify business cycles and social unrest.16 According to Hans Ulrich Wehler, this state intervention angered orthodox liberals but benefited “the preindustrial agrarian elite” and the “new lords of heavy industry,” who constituted “a cartel of anxiety.”17 This new social alliance between the agrarian aristocracy and the big-­business elite was powerful in Greater Berlin, which had a large number of industrial elites as well as aristocrats who served in military, royal, imperial, and bureaucratic capacities. Beginning in the late 1970s, the lack of mediation between the more abstract claims made by the Sonderweg and the self-­understanding of historical actors became a focal point of critique. Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn were the lead proponents of this critique, which will be more fully discussed in chapter 1, and a brief summary will have to suffice for now. Eley and Blackbourn argue against the Sonderweg and the way it attributed the weakness of German liberalism to the failed revolution of 1848. Eley and Blackbourn contend that liberalism triumphed over the ancien régime, not through one swift blow, but through a long, reconstitution of social forms to fit the needs of capitalism.18 This transformation of society appeared to be natural, but this apparent naturalness in the face of a significant break in social history is a testament to the power of capitalist social relations and their ability to adapt to local history and geography.19 Their central criticism of the Sonderweg was\n\n10\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nthat it did not mediate sufficiently between the structure of the society and economy on the one hand and political or cultural ideas on the other hand. However, this approach, in the hands of Eley and Blackbourn’s followers, treated cultural and political social forms idealistically, as separate from the social world they inhabit. Criticizing the same lack of mediation that Eley and Blackbourn addressed in the Sonderweg literature, though in a later historical period, Charles Maier introduces the category of corporatism in response to the weaknesses of “organized capitalism” as a category. While the Sonderweg historians argued that the social relations and political economy of the Kaiserreich and the Weimar Republic were essentially the same, Charles Maier introduces the category of “corporatism” to grasp the historical specificity of the Weimar Republic as a period distinct from German society during both the First World War and the Great Depression. As this study is interested in grasping a historical shift in the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin, Maier’s attention to historical specificity and to understanding the uniquely modern features of the corporatism are invaluable. He argues that, during the Weimar Republic, the state continued to transform the political economy of Germany, now under peacetime conditions, from a market economy into “a predictable and planned capitalist economy.” He contends that capitalism and the state transformed the traditional liberal boundaries between public and private and between the state and business.20 Unlike the Sonderweg historians, Maier contends that big-­business interests and agrarian interests did not always coincide. Of particular importance for this book, he argues that these powerful interests mis-­recognized their world and took steps that resulted in situations quite contrary to their original intent.21 For example, German liberals and conservatives achieved a “bourgeois victory” but did so “only by resorting to the corporatist settlements that undermined the basic anchoring conceptions of the bourgeoisie.”22 The idea of misrecognition that Maier introduces is more than just a question of unintended consequences; rather, it is a tendency of the society to produce systemic misrecognitions. This idea should not just be posited, as Maier does. Rather, in this book, it will be rooted in a theory of society that can account for the other features of the society. Demonstrating the overly broad claims of Sonderweg historiography and the weakness of accounts of industrial paternalism that treat it as pre-­modern, Dennis Sweeney insightfully shows that proponents of a corporatist society regarded that society as a progressive,\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n11\n\nscientifically based advance from nineteenth-­century liberalism. Furthermore, he shows that the transition from liberalism to corporatism began earlier than Maier claims; it began before the First World War. At the 1905 meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik, a shift in the discourse about labour conflict and large-­scale industry crystallized, constituting a new form of corporatism. In a speech at the meeting, Max Weber attacked paternalist industrial policies of owners of modern steel factories from a liberal perspective that saw the owners’ policies as antiquated.23 However, when the employers defended themselves, they criticized Weber’s liberal perspective from what they regarded as a more modern, economic, scientific, and even biological position.24 They believed that global economic competition made their corporatist approach to their employees necessary.25 Sweeney asserts that this moment exemplified a corporatist restructuring occurring in the society.26 This shift supports the contention of this book that a significant transformation in the structure of German society began in the early twentieth century towards a more corporatist society. Such an ideological shift from an industrial paternalism that liberals could regard as antiquated into a corporatism that regards itself as more advanced than liberalism can be and should be accounted for by an approach that sees social forces and ideologies as intrinsically related. However, such an approach demands that one consider society at a higher level of abstraction than the typical, discourse-­analytical historiography can sustain. However, the rise of this corporatist thinking was broader than ideas about the workplace and political economy. Similar theories about the organic cohesion of society and the social character of nature developed at roughly the same time. For example, Ferdinand Tönnies’s idea of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft contrasted “‘order and freedom’ or ‘relations based on obligation,’ on one side (Gemeinschaft, or community), and those based on ‘exchange,’ on the other (Gesellschaft, or society).” Lynn Nyhart places Tönnies’s organicist understanding of community in the context of zoologist Karl August Möbius’s ideas of “‘Biologische Gesellschaft’ (biological society)’… [and] Lebensgemeinschaft, or living community,” which “viewed the organism as a living being embedded in nature.”27 Both Sweeney and Nyhart provide important insights and pose a question about the relationship between corporatism and culture; however, their analyses of discourse and intellectual networks are inadequate. To explain the rise of this organicist and corporate vision of society, historians must turn to a theory of social mediation\n\n12\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nand capitalism, such as those offered by David Harvey and especially Moishe Postone. The Antinomies of Contemporary Urban Historiography This book brings together an analysis of a transformation of liberal to corporatist social forms through the critical engagement with the work of Sonderweg historians, Eley and Blackbourn, and historians of corporatism with a study of urban history and geography. The historiography of Berlin is vast and covers many features of Berlin’s variegated history. This book will address those more particular historiographies as the topics they address arise in the body of the text. Therefore, this section will contend with paradigmatic examples of four important modes of historiography on Berlin and on cities more generally: urban politics, urban society, urban culture, and urban governmentality. The history of Greater Berlin, and of urban history in Germany more generally, began with urban biographies that trace the political history of the city since its founding, such as late nineteenth-­and early twentieth-­century studies of Berlin by Wolfgang von Oettingen and Oscar Schwebel.28 This literature describes the large-­scale development of city politics and government, and, in the case of more specialized studies, the subtle vacillation of local politics amidst key political events, such as the Revolution of 1848 or the fortunes of smaller social groups, such as the Jews.29 This politically focused approach to the history of Greater Berlin, however, assumed that social processes such as industrialization and urbanization were quasi-­natural forces and, as such, could not adequately come to terms with political responses to industrialization and urbanization. Beginning in the 1950s, in response to the weaknesses of the existing political historiography, historians took a social science–oriented approach to German urbanization and industrialization. This social historiography is valuable for the ways that it demonstrates the existence and constitutive power of social processes that are beyond the control of individual agency. This research interrogated historical developments that the political historiography had regarded as parts of the natural evolution of civilization, such as the location of cities, the character of their urbanization, the relationship between industrialization and urbanization, neighbourhood and industrial network formation, social mobility, and mass migration. However, these developments are not natural; they are the consequence of historically specific social relations. Understanding these developments is key to grasping the\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n13\n\npolitical as well as the social and cultural dynamics that underpinned changing appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin. This social science–oriented literature argued that quantitative measures could accurately describe social forces in urban history. The work of Lothar Baar and of Ingrid Thienel marked the high point of this literature’s exploration of Greater Berlin.30 However, critics correctly argued that this literature did not mediate effectively between the social forces it described and the self-­understanding of the individuals experiencing these social forces. Historians also demonstrated that the statistics gatherers held the political, social, and cultural presumptions and revealed that the “hard facts” on which social-­science history was built could create a weak or skewed foundation, because of the historically specific cultural ideas that shaped the counting and categorization of the statisticians.31 However, in their rejection of social history, these cultural historians sacrificed and forgot important insights from social history. In the 1970s a cultural historiography responded to this lack of mediation between the self-­understanding of historical actors and social forces in the social history. It peaked in the 1990s and remains the prevailing mode of historical scholarship. The work of Andrew Lees and Peter Fritzsche represents some of the best of this cultural history. Lees uses the reaction to the rapid urbanization of Greater Berlin as a way to understand attitudes towards modernity.32 Lees does an excellent job of grasping a wide variety of ideas about Berlin and cities more generally and demonstrating “not only the paradigmatic centrality but also the complexity and the variability of the often heated conversation that revolved around the Prussian-­German capital.”33 According to Lees, the response also had an influence “on patterns of thought and feeling” and “generated a vast outpouring of inquiry, research, reflection, and debate.”34 While Lees’s work demonstrates a multiplicity of “thoughts and feelings,” this book will seek to understand the “patterns” that shape this multiplicity, why they exist, why they take their particular form, and why they change over time. Peter Fritzsche analyses the “‘word city,’ the accumulation of small bits and rich streams of text that saturated the twentieth-­century city, guided and misguided its inhabitants, and in large measure fashioned the nature of metropolitan experience.” True to this culturalist approach to cities, he seeks to examine “the terms of mediation between city and text.” Fritzsche regards the city through a textual lens: “reading and writing in the city invited as well as contained public movements through the city.” He hopes to demonstrate this textuality through maintaining “the broad strokes\n\n14\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nof narrational order,” but also “bring[ing] in the sharp counter-­strokes of interpretative disorder, both of which emerge out of the relations between readers and texts and contexts.” Fritzsche contends that this “word city” can mislead inhabitants.35 The possibility that urbanites can be misled and misrecognize their world suggests that a social world exists that is beyond the intertextual realm that Fritzsche lays out. For Fritzsche, the city is a site of circulation and consumption and a locus of critical indeterminacy and resistance. He celebrates the metropolis as city, which he associates with market anarchy, and compares to the metropolis as capital, which he associates with “regimentation and discipline.”36 In other words, for Fritzsche, the market and the state stand opposed to each other. In Fritzsche’s vision, Berlin is a dynamic social chaos, yet it is also capable of creating forms of misrecognition. Explaining the possibility of such misrecognition demands a theorization of society that is not possible within the standard discourse-­analysis or empiricist approach to history. This book attempts to explain the misrecognitions that Fritzsche and Maier describe and the patterns of urban consciousness that Lees outlines with reference to the dynamic structural forces that the quantitative historiography delineates while mediating between the self-­understanding of historical actors and these structural forces, as Eley and Blackbourn encourage. The cutting-­edge contemporary literature picks up the same opposition that Fritzsche expresses between the power of the state and a purported natural anarchy of social life, often associated with the market. This most recent literature employs Michel Foucault’s idea of “governmentality” to grasp the ways that modern society is structured by abstract forms of mediation such that a society ostensibly built on freedom and rationality could be dominating.37 This literature has important insights into this peculiar, modern form of abstract domination and finds the cause of abstract domination in concrete social practices. Leif Jerram treats massive and rapid urbanization as the consequence of individual choices, rejecting the insights gained by the social-­science-­ oriented historiography, which grasped urbanization abstractly and quantitatively.38 Jerram ascribes significant cultural changes such as new notions of selfhood, of the interiority of psychic life, and of privacy to concrete changes in urban social space, such as the separation of work and home and the division of the home into rooms. He notices an important shift in the appearance, function, and perception of the city in the early twentieth century: “The nineteenth-­century obsession with the superficial appearance of buildings was displaced by a\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n15\n\nrevolutionary obsession on the part of ‘experts’ and states with what went on inside of buildings.” Jerram asserts that intervention and social planning necessarily led to domination, even mass murder.39 Here Jerram reveals a common problem with discursive and governmentality-­ focused accounts of social change. His approach cannot account for the new power of experts or the shift in the population from desiring privacy to seeking intervention “in the minutest details of people’s everyday lives.”40 Jerram cannot explain how experts, who were subjected to this same liberal, privacy-­oriented ideology, could step outside of this ideology and transform it. This book develops an approach that is adequate to the research problem that Jerram raises and can explain this shift in both expert and popular subjectivity. The pioneering text of this urban governmentality historiography is James Scott’s Seeing like a State. It focuses on the abstract rationality of the state, which it roots in the Enlightenment. Scott claims that this abstract rationality drives the state’s purported desire to make cities visible and legible and is the view of the foreigner, and prefers “a repetitive, abstract logic that would allow a newcomer to orient herself.”41 He sides with the locals against the “outside elites” and celebrates illegible spaces as defensive fortresses and refuges.42 Like Jerram, Scott associates the horrors of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries with a desire to plan.43 This literature claims that planning necessarily leads at best to tragic failure and at worst to mass murder. This literature is important for the ways that it reveals that certain abstract, dominating modes of thought can constitute social life; however, it is limited, because it sees this mode of thought as imposed from the outside, as separate from and prior to social relations, and as driven by an ontological will-­to-­power of the state. This governmentality-­influenced scholarship opposes the abstract, superficial, and rational character of state actions to the concrete, chaotic, authentic, and unplannable character of social life.44 This literature is valuable for the ways that it describes forms of abstract domination embodied in concrete social practices. However, the theoretical approach it employs cannot explain why the abstract domination exists, why it has this concrete embodiment, and how and why this domination changes. This urban governmentality literature reifies the dominating structure of knowledge out of its social context, that is, out of capitalism. The approach developed in this book will attempt to account for the historical specificity of this abstract domination and its concrete form. The discourse of the dominating state and the free, authentic, and anarchic local market that is evident in Fritzsche, Jerram, and Scott\n\n16\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nis a very common ideology in the present era – and is employed in far more areas than this specific context of late nineteenth-­and early twentieth-­ century city planning. Jan van Ballegooijen and Roberto Rocco insightfully criticize this ideology in the context of the contemporary celebration of informal urbanization, revealing the ubiquity of these ideas and suggesting that intellectual networks and influences cannot explain their proliferation. They demonstrate the centrality of a celebratory vision of informal urbanization in contemporary discourses about cities and housing that emphasizes the creativity, anarchism, and authenticity in informal urbanization and that attacks the dominating, abstract, uniform manner of state-­supported planning. They show the way that this opposition between the local, unregulated market and the overweening state reflects neoliberal visions of the world and reveals the historical specificity of this critique of the state. They argue that this celebration of informal urbanization lost its critical valance with the end of Fordist-­Keynesian state regulations, and informality became idealized. They argue that this celebration amounts to “the aestheticization of poverty” and reifies it from its political and economic context.45 The authors demonstrate how what began as an “anarchist or liberal leftist” discourse became a neoliberal critique of the remnants of the Fordist-­Keynesian state.46 The point here is not to condemn the form of city planning, architecture, or historiography for reflecting the prevailing, in this case neoliberal, vision of the world. Rather, the problem arises that when authors regard this discourse as critical, when, in fact, it affirms the status quo. Moishe Postone cautions that just as “in an earlier global transition of capitalism, Marxists frequently opposed general rational planning to the anarchic irrationality of the market” in a way that “legitimate[d] a subsequent state-­centric capitalism,” this celebration of a natural chaos in human society in opposition to state planning and intervention “can serve to veil and legitimate a new global form that combines decentralization and heterogeneity of production and consumption with increasing centralization of control and underlying homogeneity.”47 The literature on urban governmentality is still battling with the state of the mid-­twentieth century and doing so in a neoliberal or conservative fashion. The City and Culture If scholars are to move beyond the idealism that characterizes discourse analysis and the concretism that delineates the historiography of the spread of an idea or of the constitution of urban liberal subjects, they\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n17\n\nneed to begin to relate the practical world of modern capitalism to the ideas about that world. This is not an immediate relation; rather, it is mediated by a wide variety of social and cultural ideas and forces, but theory and practice are nonetheless connected in fundamental ways. Grasping the transformation of ideas about Berlin (as well as other cities) between 1871 and 1933 demands an understanding of how Berlin, as a geographic and economic process, was itself being transformed. This book relates the dual transformation of theory and practice to broader changes in the character of capitalism. However, this book has no model to follow. It cannot apply this or that theory or use this or that historiographical method, because such a theory or urban historiography does not exist. Therefore this book attempts to develop a new approach through a critical engagement with primary sources, historiography, and social theory. Incorporating the work of Neil Brenner, this book suggests that a reterritorialization of urban economic geography, territory, and scale occurred in the early twentieth century.48 It attempts to respond to Henri Lefebvre’s provocation in The Production of Space, “The fact is that around 1910 a certain space was shattered.”49 While Lefebvre moves on without substantively addressing this comment, David Harvey answers Lefebvre with an eclectic list of new ideas about space coming around 1910, revealing lack of theorization of the relationship between culture and capitalism.50 To account for this simultaneous shift in culture, economy, and geography, this book draws on Brenner’s idea that the “second industrial revolution” led to cities that were “engines of Fordist mass production,” and a global, liberal economic system became “compartmentalized into distinct territorial states” in which “a relatively tight fit was established between urban dynamism and national economic growth,” though transnational connections between cities did remain important.51 An era of relatively vibrant global capitalism and financialization ended, and in its place arose a more nationally based and autarkic system.52 This book will offer an account, on a more concrete level, of this change in the theory and practice of urban space. An approach adequate to the transformation in the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin from ones structured by liberal social forms to ones structured by corporatist social forms needs to be able to bring politics, social forces, and culture into a dynamic relation. Furthermore, it must be capable of understanding the historical specificity of politics, social forces, and culture and explain a shift at various levels from a liberal society and culture to a corporatist society and culture. This book builds upon David Harvey’s concept of a regime of\n\n18\n\nUrban Transformations\n\naccumulation that periodizes modern history according to the relationship between historically specific global social, political, cultural, and economic configurations that are generated by and facilitate the continued accumulation of capital. However, this book attempts to account for the subjective dimension of a regime of accumulation and a transition between regimes.53 Harvey’s concept is helpful for the ways that it grasps the fact that the form of appearance of capitalism can change while remaining, fundamentally, capitalism. This book seeks to move beyond Harvey by seeing capitalism and culture as intrinsically related and graspable by the same set of categories.54 Grasping this transformation in the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin and other cities, as this introduction has argued, requires considering these transformations at a higher level of abstraction and theoretical considerations of social processes. Urban space did change fundamentally around 1910, and, through the example of Berlin, this book will examine that change in the character of modern, capitalist, urban space. As Max Horkheimer argued, “The fortunes of the individual have always been bound up with the development of urban society. The city dweller is the individual par excellence.… The antagonism between individuality and the economic and social conditions of its existence … is an essential element in individuality itself. Today, this antagonism is supplanted in the conscious minds of individuals by a desire to adapt themselves to reality. This process is symptomatic of the present crisis of the individual, which in turn reflects the breakdown of the traditional idea of the city.”55 Employing the work of Max Horkheimer and his colleagues in the Institute for Social Research, this book argues that a specific form of individuality and selfhood is closely related to a specific form of urban space.56 In the early twentieth century, concepts of individuality, selfhood, and urban space began to change and change in the same way, such that integration and adaptation were valued over individuality and liberalism. Engineers guided the city planning of Greater Berlin, but by the late nineteenth century, aesthetic planners, who were often also architects, sought to introduce beauty into urban design. After the First World War the dominant mode of planning came from functionalist architects who argued that form followed function but also tried to make functionality beautiful. Debates about what constitutes a beautiful city and what about urban life is culturally deleterious or edifying run throughout the sources for this book. Furthermore, the perception and reality of the functionality of cities – and their relationship to beauty – drive\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n19\n\nsignificant changes both in the aesthetics and the policy of urban government and city planning. Drawing on “The Affirmative Character of Culture” by Herbert Marcuse, this book argues that this form of the opposition between the functional and the beautiful is distinctly modern. While feudal society ensured the undesirable practical existence of most people and the beautiful existence of a few, with the advent of capitalism the good and the beautiful were viewed as available, applicable, and obligatory values for the lives of all people. While capitalism deems practical life not directed at continued accumulation of capital to be superfluous, from the perspective of these affirmative cultural values, the beautiful can transform social life.57 This affirmative form of culture removes ideas of beauty from their specific moment in social history and assumes, incorrectly, that they are universal and an end in themselves capable of transforming individuals while leaving the prevailing society intact.58 Freed from the constraints, protections, and responsibilities of feudal society, liberal subjects provide for their own needs and satisfaction through mass-­produced commodities available on the market. However, this equal access to happiness is abstract only; the concrete inequality of capitalist society meant that for much of the society, such happiness is unattainable, but acknowledging that this abstract equality was insufficient for most people would surrender liberalism’s claim to universality.59 However, Marcuse points out, this idea of culture is double-­sided: “It contains not only the justification of the established form of existence but also the pain of its establishment: not only quiescence about what is but also remembrance of what could be.”60 In the movement from a city organized by liberal social forms into a city organized by corporatist social forms, this book argues, the First World War marks a significant crux point. Furthermore, this shift is evident not just in the functioning of the city, but also in the ideas about what does or could make a city beautiful and culturally edifying. Marcuse suggests that under the pressure of total mobilization during the First World War, the form of affirmative culture changed, undermining the progressive dimensions of individuality, though not changing the content of affirmative culture. This new form of affirmative culture was transformed from focusing on an “abstract internal community” to demanding that the individual is integrated and integrate himself into “a false collectivity (race, folk, blood, and soil).” However, in both cases, this ideology of culture perpetuates capitalism and demands “renunciation and subjection to the status quo, made bearable by the real appearance of gratification.”61 In this new form, affirmative culture\n\n20\n\nUrban Transformations\n\ncelebrates “humility, sacrifice, poverty, and dutifulness on the one hand, and extreme will to power, impulse to expansion, and technical and military perfection on the other.”62 The form of culture underwent a significant change between liberal and corporatist ideas of culture, but they remained capitalist ideas of culture and were thus affirmative. Liberalism and Corporatism as Historically Specific Social Forms This transformation in the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin from ones structured by liberal social forms to one structured by corporatist social forms constitutes and reconstitutes political, social, and cultural dynamics, all while remaining essentially capitalist. The approach to this problem needs to understand the historical specificity of politics, social forces, and culture and to explain a shift from liberal to corporatist social forms. Drawing on the arguments of Georg Lukacs, this book regards social forms as constituted and reconstituted in and through processes of social history. Social forms appear ontological but are part of a social process called reification, which is historically specific to capitalism.63 To grasp this process of reification, this book relies on a historically specific category of theory and practice: the commodity form. Using the commodity form, this book endeavours to understand the embeddedness of culture in its historical moment, and in particular the transition out of liberal politics and political economy and into mid-­twentieth-­century capitalism. This book argues that the commodity form enables the historian to mediate between the deep structure of the capitalist dynamic and its historically specific forms of appearance. The problem of this transformation in the form, function, and perception of Greater Berlin from one mediated by liberal social forms into one mediated by corporatist social forms demands a theory that can address, with the same apparatus, both social relations and cultural ideas in capitalism. As already suggested, the visions of the capitalist dynamic take on a dualistic form. This dualism is constituted by the commodity form, which is a historically specific form of mediation linked to capitalism that brings together and shapes all of the subjective and objective dimensions of capitalist society.64 The commodity is both the consequence of labouring activity in the form of an object, and the objectification of the social relations that went into the creation of the commodity. These social relations are both expressed and veiled socially in this commodity, and they have no expression independent from this commodity.\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n21\n\nThis notion of the commodity form suggests that fundamental dualisms characterize capitalism and attempt to ground those dualisms socially and historically. As Moishe Postone explains, the commodity has “an abstract, general, homogeneous dimension (‘value’) – ­including a system of abstract domination and compulsion which, although social is impersonal and ‘objective’ – and concrete particular, material dimension (‘use-­value’). Moreover, because they are mediated ‘objectively,’ both dimensions appear to be natural rather than social.” The abstract dimension appears in the form of abstract and “objective” natural laws, and the concrete dimension manifests itself as pure “thingly” nature.65 With this approach, one can offer a more compelling account of the historical specificity of this dualistic thinking in general and of the systematic forms of misrecognition described by Fritzsche and Maier. One can also suggest the further historical specificity of each side of the duality. Furthermore, it can provide social historical grounding for the forms of abstract domination and their concrete carriers that the governmentality-­oriented historians describe, and because it is linked to a theory of social dynamics, it can explain the changing character of these abstract forms of domination. The visions of the city, which contemporaries often conflated with capitalist modernity and with capitalism itself, underwent a significant shift from “liberal” to “corporatist” frames of reference. This book accounts for this historical change as an effect of the way the commodity form mediated social relations. Following Postone, this book argues that as capitalism develops, it sheds the dominant mechanistic vision of the world characteristic of the early modern period and “the naturalization immanent to the commodity fetish becomes increasingly biologized.… Society, as well as historical process[es], becomes increasingly understood in biological terms.” As Postone explains, the “double character” of the commodity form “allows concrete labor to appear as a purely material, creative process, separable from capitalist social relations, and allows the commodity to appear as a purely material entity rather than as the objectification of mediated social relations.” This brings about a dichotomy between industrial production, “as a purely material, creative process, separable from capital,” and finance capital as “parasitic.” The “biological interpretation” facilitates a “glorification of industrial capital and technology” in that “both are on the ‘thingly’ side of the antinomy.”66 Such a dichotomy exists in the discourse on Greater Berlin. Over the course of this study, contemporaries changed the side of that dichotomy that they privileged, but the\n\n22\n\nUrban Transformations\n\ndichotomy persists. Capitalism appeared in this discourse as a duality, one concrete and the other abstract, because of the peculiar and historically specific character of labour in capitalism. Especially in developed capitalist societies, the economy as a whole appears divided in two, with the abstract dimensions of capitalism – finance, liberalism, the market, and speculation – expanded so that they are perceived to be the totality of capitalist relations, while production, labour, technology, and other more “concrete” social forms appear as outside of capitalism and thus natural. This dualistic vision of the world often leads people to criticize the abstract aspect of capitalism as distinguished from the concrete dimension. Planners and administrators understood the concrete as a unified, deeply rooted, perhaps racially particular organism beset by the rootless, parasitic, unproductive abstract.67 The Plan of This Argument Chapter 1 addresses the growth and development of Greater Berlin in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It explores the growing sense that Berlin represented a social and cultural crisis and then attempts to address this crisis through the means of municipal administration. Chapter 1 explores the political and economic development of liberalism in Berlin and in Germany, with the goal of showing that liberalism is best understood not as just an ideology of economy and politics; rather, liberalism is best understood as the formal structure of culture and society during a historically specific period. The dynamics of capitalism shaped and reshaped the political and social history of Greater Berlin. Chapter 2 focuses on the sense of crisis in the built environment and analyses liberal forms of city planning. This chapter proposes the existence of a distinctly liberal form of city planning and then examines liberal city planning and its subsequent crisis of both theory and practice. It provides context for liberal planning within prevailing territorialization of the economic region, municipality, state, and Reich, arguing that they are historically specific to a liberal regime of capital accumulation. Chapter 3 examines two major efforts to create a single city – ­administratively and as an urban space – to address the historical development of capitalism and the contemporary historical reterritorialization. The first part analyses a city-­planning contest held to organize the rapidly agglomerating urban space of Greater Berlin. The second section interrogates the creation of a new regional administration – the Verband\n\nTowards a Critical Historical Study of Greater Berlin\n\n23\n\nGroß-­Berlin – and the ideology that it brought to its specific tasks and its practical efforts. Both of these efforts illustrate the limits of liberal city planning and municipal administration and offer up a new direction. It is here, around 1910, that one can begin to see liberal space shatter. Chapter 4 argues that while the transformation from liberal to corporatist social forms took roughly sixty years between 1871 and 1933, the First World War and the November 1918 Revolution represent a crucial point. The chapter contends that the social conditions of the First World War restructured the relationships among the state, civil society, the economy, and the military, changing how the urban region was understood and functioned, and eroded the conditions of possibility for liberal capitalism, introducing the expectation of significant levels of planning. Chapter 5 contextualizes the struggles of municipalities in the Weimar Republic within the broader socioeconomic conditions of the period. This chapter proposes that a coercive political economic dynamic developed between the state, banks, industry, and municipalities and the housing industry. It argues that there was a significant shift in the scale of city government and in the living space necessary for a healthy community and a dynamic economy and that the crisis of the Great Depression deepened the commitment, on all levels of government, to a corporatist state. Chapter 6 follows the development of city planning and architecture in the Weimar Republic. In particular it focuses on the perceived connections between access to living spaces, nature, modern city planning, and a healthy, productive society. As was the case with the expansion of the scale of city government, city planning significantly increased its scale and pressed for more intensive and extensive planning. This book examines a transformation from liberal to corporatist in the form of the discourses and practices that shaped the appearance, function, and perception of Greater Berlin. I show that around 1871, city planners and municipal administrators emphasized free markets, the rule of law, and trade. By the early 1930s, however, they emphasized an integrative, corporate, and productivist vision. I argue that this change was a broad transformation in the social forms that shaped popular understanding of Greater Berlin and relate this change to contemporaneous shifts in the cultural and social history of global capitalism. The volume engages city planning, municipal administration, architecture, political economy, and jurisprudence sources held in the Landesarchiv Berlin, Geheimes Staatsarchiv, and Archiv der Akademie der Künste, as well as digitized and hard-­copy published sources.\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\nIntroduction: The Limits of Liberalism Berlin was “an infinitely expanding image of crisis” that “still could be five times larger,” claimed Karl Scheffler in 1910.1 This common perception grew out of the social, political, geographic, and cultural conditions of capitalist industrialization and the way those circumstances transformed the form and content of German cities and in turn changed their administrations.2 This transformation also reconstituted spheres of urban life that were not immediately connected to either politics or economics. The sense of crisis arose from a conflict between the prevailing view of society, which was liberal, and the trajectory of both capitalism and the state. Carl Schorske frames a similar sense of crisis among Viennese liberals as turning away from a celebration of rationality to a romantic glorification of irrationality and intuition due to a political defeat.3 Schorske’s account, however, underestimates the social complexity of this sense of crisis. At one time a liberal world view seemed in tune with capitalism and government and to exemplify the achievements and aspirations of modernity, such that it appeared that liberal political and social revolutions were stripping away a history of innocence and superstition to reveal the essence of humans and their society. By 1900, however, capitalism was transforming itself away from structures that coincided with liberal principles and fabricating a new social framework, a new regime of accumulation.4 Around 1910, the form, function, and perception of Berlin shifted away from ones structured by a liberal world view and practices to ones structured by a corporatist world view and practices. To understand\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n25\n\nthis shift, it is necessary to understand this liberal structuring of Greater Berlin and to grasp the tendencies in liberalism that gave rise to this shift. This shift was a global change in the character of capitalism that had local consequences in Germany and in Berlin. This change affected the character of political and economic relations and of governmental structure, part of a “reterritorialization” of the municipality, the province, the state, and the empire (though this book will focus on the municipal level).5 This shift transformed the prevailing ideological assumptions about the world and especially about cities. It extended beyond stereotypically liberal realms of economics, state structure, or jurisdiction; rather, it reconstituted social and cultural perceptions of the world, including of Berlin. The sense of crisis and the disjunction between a liberal world view and the society and culture it attempted to comprehend, however, arose from the contradictions within liberalism itself. This chapter will chart the political, social, and economic development of liberalism in Germany, and in Berlin in particular, to then demonstrate that liberalism cannot be understood merely as one among many modes of the economics and politics. Rather, liberalism is best understood as the formal structure of culture and society during a historically specific period. This chapter will argue that capitalism fundamentally transformed German society and cities, but this transformation appeared natural and silent as if guided by the natural laws that govern society. Despite this appearance, this new structure was radically different from what had come before. Though institutions from earlier historical epochs endured, formally, such as the aristocracy, their content changed. Historians, at times, miss the change in content and thus misinterpret this endurance of older institutions as evidence that the society in question was caught in a pre-­modern social structure and miss the ways that the content of that institution had been reconstituted to seek modern ends. The chapter will explore an example of such changes: the changing legal justification of municipal self-­administration, a pre-­modern institution, which survived into the nineteenth century. To historians, the structure of municipal administration seems to be a legal question distinct from capitalism; in fact, capitalism shaped and reshaped this legal institution. Municipal administration attempted to address the problems and opportunities generated by industrial capitalism. The form, function, and perception of Greater Berlin were transformed from entities based on liberal principles into one built along\n\n26\n\nUrban Transformations\n\ncorporatist principles, a shift reflected in capitalism itself. This change in capitalism also entailed a “reterritorialization” of the municipality, the state, and the Reich. This chapter will examine the social forms of liberal capitalism in the urban context of Berlin and then trace the growing contradiction between the urban social order in Berlin and liberal ideas. Finally, it will address attempts by liberal thinkers to understand and account for the failure of liberalism to effectively grasp this increasingly post-­liberal world. In so doing, the chapter establishes the condition of possibility for a crisis of liberal social forms in the context of Greater Berlin. The Social and Political Transformation of Nineteenth-­Century Germany and Its Cities As the liberal era of capitalism was constituting itself, it reorganized social relations – including municipal administration and city ­planning – according to abstract principles that seemed to express the essence of social relations. In the nineteenth century, industrialization, intensified interconnection of the global economy, and rapid urbanization transformed societies globally and, though many locales had their own iteration of this new society, capitalism subsumed existing societies into itself. Capitalism, in overcoming the ancien régime, expressed itself as liberalism and structured society according to abstract principles that liberals believed expressed the essence of society. Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn argue that the “bourgeois society” arose slowly through a longue durée reconstitution of social forms.6 For Eley, liberalism was the manifest politics and the revolutionary edge of this process: it meant eliminating impediments to private enterprise, a free market for all commodities including land, the equality before the law for citizens, a separation between church and state, commercial law, meritocracy, and some representative government. This social transformation affected the form, content, and perception of social relations. The formal changes Eley enumerates coincided with a society increasingly organized by capitalism and a capitalism increasingly able to reconstitute the content of social relations to fit its needs.7 Liberals believed that their economic and governmental reforms revealed an essence of social relations, which tradition had obscured. As capitalism transformed society, Blackbourn argues, the victories of this liberal social revolution appeared “natural,” a testament to how\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n27\n\nfundamentally it changed both the activities of social life and how society understood these activities.8 The global revolution, Eley explains, took a form in Germany that was specific to the country’s history and culture, to Germany’s mid-­nineteenth-­century industrialization, and to the specific form of absolutist society that capitalism was transforming.9 The essence, which liberals believed they were revealing, was abstract. Liberal economic and legal reforms began in the late eighteenth century with the development of abstract social categories of the citizen, the law-­based state, the private individual, private property, and distinct systems of “public and private law.” They broke radically from the pre-­modern corporate state and society. During the Napoleonic era in German-­speaking states, liberals instituted reforms including emancipating peasants, eliminating guilds, and secularizing charitable foundations.10 This legal and economic vision guided the North German Confederation of 1867 and the German Reich of 1871 and made the bureaucracy subject to the law in the 1870s. Blackbourn suggests that these reforms, along with rights to free speech and petition, made citizens formally equal before the law.11 Furthermore, the nineteenth-­ century penal and civil code was based on the rights of private citizens.12 Even those who were ambivalent or opposed to liberalism implemented liberal reforms, illustrating the apparent naturalness of this revolution.13 Through these reforms, liberalism constituted society and did so on a distinctly abstract basis.14 In Germany, as in Britain, liberals believed that expanding the franchise would constitute individuals and citizens. They trusted that this abstract form of representation would counteract concrete and pre-­ modern corporate relations. Elaine Hadley’s argument about mid-­ nineteenth-­ century British liberalism is also valid for Germany: liberalism offered a private and “abstracted individuality,” freeing people from their particular, concrete bodies and social spaces.15 This market-­centred revolution replaced corporate mores and rights with openness and formal equality. Furthermore, as Blackbourn notes, members of society met most of their needs through a market, shared a legal system, and, as abstract individuals, constituted “the ‘public.’”16 These individuals were freely associating as abstractly equal citizens, and the market mediated their production and consumption. This transformation of social relations according to the abstract principles of liberal capitalism appeared “natural,” not simply because it was slow or silent, but because key categories of capitalism – like time,\n\n28\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nmoney, and labour – appear commonplace, despite their radically new form. If this transformation of legal and economic relations was not the agentive project of the bourgeoisie or of liberals, one must ask what caused this change and why it appeared so organic. The liberal revolution that Blackbourn describes is peculiarly abstract and universalist, and its slow pace is insufficient to explain the relative silence and apparent naturalness of this radical transformation. Blackbourn relates this process to capitalism but pursues that issue – beyond concerns for legal protections for property – no further. Liberal assumptions about social relations having an abstract, law-­ like essence have shaped the reforms of municipal government after the French Revolution. These reforms introduced a key legal and political category: municipal self-­administration. When German-­speaking Länder were under Napoleonic control, Karl Freiherr vom Stein, a Franconian aristocrat with a family estate in Nassau who briefly served as minister of the economy and finance but went into exile for his anti-­Napoleonic views, orchestrated reforms that opened municipal and provincial government to property owners, to harness their talents to the public good.17 Stein proposed new representative institutions to counteract the Hohenzollern civil service and hereditary nobility. Edicts in 1807 and 1808 abolished serfdom in Prussia, opened up the professions, made private property a commodity, and created local self-­administration.18 The new institutions established an elected city council, the Stadtverordnetenversammlung, which in turn elected an executive branch, the Magistrat, which included the Oberbürgermeister (Lord Mayor). The council had budgetary powers and supervised the executive branch of the municipal administration, which was staffed by salaried employees elected to six-­or twelve-­year terms, and worked with unpaid city fathers, whose number depended on the size of the city. Geographically determined wards elected the councils, and estates and guilds held no special power. Only citizens could vote, but the city could not deny citizenship to residents of “reputable character,” including unmarried women. Business people were required to become citizens and had the franchise, as did owners of property of a certain size; all others needed to demonstrate that they received a modest income. Aspiring citizens needed to apply and pay a fee. Citizenship did not guarantee suffrage, and residence did not guarantee citizenship: wives, children, servants, and apprentices, and those without permanent residence, including soldiers, were excluded. Women and Magistrat members could not vote. The numbers with the franchise remained remarkably small.19\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n29\n\nWhile the 1848 Revolution challenged the illiberal aspects of municipal government and advanced a liberal municipal agenda, the counter-­ revolution retrenched the Prussian elites and incorporated new capitalist elites. However, the Prussian elite power was no longer based on aristocratic privilege, but on their role as large-­scale capitalist farmers.20 The counter-­revolution curtailed municipal self-­administration, making it a liberal goal. The Städteordnung of 1853 opened citizenship to all men over twenty-­five years of age residing within the city boundaries, grounded the roles of the Magistrat and the city council, and set up the municipality as a legal corporation.21 The ordinance also reduced the fraction of city councillors who needed to own residential buildings from two-­thirds in Stein’s ordinance to one-­half.22 However, the 1853 Städteordnung also tightened state control over municipal affairs in the six eastern provinces (which included Brandenburg, home to Berlin) and maintained the property restrictions on who could hold office.23 The ordinance banned discussion of general political questions in the city council, and if such questions arose, the state could immediately dissolve the council and hold new elections. In addition, the 1853 Städteordnung established a three-­class voting system in Prussian city elections.24 The power of votes was determined accordingly: the full range of direct tax payments was divided into thirds, and each of those thirds elected a third of the representatives. Because of rapid urbanization and proletarianization, this division roughly translated into less than 5 per cent of the population in the first tier, less than 15 per cent in the second, and more than 80 per cent in the third. By the 1890s wages had increased enough so that workers could qualify for citizenship and membership in the third tier, placing 90–94 per cent of the electorate in that third tier.25 In Berlin, in 1900, 1,446 first-­class voters elected the same number of representatives as 304,418 third-­class voters.26 When Otto von Bismarck created a German nation state in 1871, liberals achieved a central political goal; however, as the result of Bismarck’s role it had a conservative, bureaucratic, and Prussian character. With this goal achieved and Bismarck turning away from liberal allies, liberal politics began to retreat. Two Prussian laws in the 1870s addressing municipal self-­administration registered the liberal acquiescence to a capitalist modernity that brought together liberal and aristocratic social orders. After 1871, Bismarck turned to protectionist economic policies in response to the Depression of 1873–96, and a revolutionary workers’ movement was founded. These pressures from the right and left made liberals more comfortable in their retreat. The first Prussian\n\n30\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nlaw addressing municipal self-­administration, in 1874, gave cities the power to expropriate land to build streets. The second, in 1875, and known as the Fluchtliniengesetz, “clarified and expanded” the municipality’s right to set street and building lines and to assess property owners for the cost of streets and sewers, and to prohibit building in areas without street layouts.27 This constitution of society in the image of liberalism, a testament to the ways that the transformation worked behind the backs of those carrying it out, was often undertaken by people who were ambivalent or even opposed to liberalism. Though the state established a more genuine self-­administration for municipalities in the 1870s, it retained police powers, including control over building inspection. In most major Prussian cities, the police force was a state institution, and the Polizeipräsident was appointed by and responsible to state authorities.28 However, the existing society was fundamentally transformed, and while liberals were forced to acquiesce to the continued existence of the aristocracy, aristocrats had become capitalists. The Particularity of Municipal Administration in Greater Berlin The national-­and state-­ level liberal politics and the consequences of capitalism on legal and administrative structures had important, though varied, consequences for local politics. The capitalist transformation and reform of administrative structures of Greater Berlin spurred rapid industrialization, working-­ class radicalism, dramatic population growth, poor-­quality housing, and regional administrative incoherence. These social changes spurred cultural concerns among Germans about modernity, but the first urban historiography of Greater Berlin treats this transformation as a political question; for example, the important work of Hans Herzfeld and Otto Büsch focused on parties and personalities in the city council, the Magistrat, the police, and the state.29 Their research was part of the early period of urban historiography in Germany, the United States, Britain, and France.30 Berlin’s municipal self-­administration was unique for a variety of reasons. It had unusual local voting laws and had uniquely fractious local politics. The municipal administration’s autonomy was newer and weaker than in most German cities. The Berlin municipal self-­ administration was directly subordinate to the will of the minister of the interior and to the Kaiser and king. And finally, Berlin was a massive centre of military power.\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n31\n\nWhen liberals confronted the conservative Prussian state, universal male suffrage had been a central goal of liberal politics, in the belief that this would register the general will and empower liberal politics. However, with the combination of industrialization, the expansion of the franchise, and the growth of working-­class politics, liberal responses to working-­class electoral power reveal a fissure in a society structured by liberal norms. Berlin’s municipal government and its role in higher levels of German government were structured by the systematic undermining of the power of Berliners’ votes. Changes in municipal voting laws in 1850 led to the municipal legislative body in Berlin shrinking to a third of its former size, with the conservatives winning 76 per cent of the seats. Despite an electorate that nearly quadrupled between 1850 and 1870, the voting turnout for the city council fell from 70 per cent in 1850 to 18 per cent in 1870.31 Meanwhile, the three-­tier system prevailed in Berlin communal elections. In 1867 the state divided Berlin into six geographical wards, which remained unchanged until 1918. As the population ballooned, especially in working-­class districts, these wards remained the same. In 1871 the wards varied from 16,000 voters at the smallest to 22,000 voters at the largest; however, by 1912 – the year of the greatest electoral success for the Socialists in the Kaiserreich – the smallest ward had 13,000 voters and the largest counted 220,000 voters. The state denied workers a true franchise in order to block the growth of opposition parties, especially the Social Democrats (SPD), in the Reichstag. However, in 1912 the SPD garnered more than 34 per cent of the vote nationally and five out of the six seats representing Berlin, as well as four more seats from Greater Berlin. A left-­liberal politician had represented most wards by 1881, but by 1884 the Socialists were able to win the vote in two wards. Beginning in 1903 the Socialists held growing majorities in five of the six wards.32 The rise of the socialists as an urban electoral power challenged the liberal view of the world. The responses to this socialist power contributed significantly to the transformation of liberalism into something else. The politics in Berlin were fractious because, in addition to the military and the sizable bureaucratic presence, Berlin was also the home to significant right-­wing populist, liberal, and Socialist politics. When the state allowed local politics to exist in Berlin, it tended to have a strong petit bourgeois leaning. Even though the city was a major centre of industry, commerce, and banking, “artisans and shopkeepers (and often the property owners association) set the tone of city government.”33\n\n32\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nOne example of this tilt towards the petit bourgeois was the success of Adolf Stöcker’s anti-­Semitic Berlin Movement.34 This tendency was one that Berlin shared with Vienna.35 Prussia and the Reich constrained Berlin’s municipal self-­ administration more than in most German cities. Both the Polizeipräsident and the Oberbürgermeister were directly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior and to the kaiser and king himself. This, combined with the left-­leaning politics of the city, meant that governing Berlin was “a question of domestic power of the first rank,” provoking special constitutional regulations – breaks from liberal legal norms.36 Berlin never gained the right to police powers during the Kaiserreich.37 As city councillor Heinrich Dove argued about Berlin in a 1906 Verein für Sozialpolitik project on city government, Berlin retained “only a small measure of its allotted independent activity,” and Berlin’s “rapid development … went hand in hand with the expansion from above of the structure of the state itself and with the rise of Hohenzollern princely power.”38 The changes wrought in Berlin through the rise and collapse of liberal politics and the industrialization of the city shaped and were shaped by the major political forces and how they interacted with the municipal administration. In many circumstances, the results of voting in Berlin were of little consequence, because the municipal administration was not under the control of elected bodies. Rather, its authority lay with the chief of police, who reported to the Prussian minister of the interior, and with the Prussian military and ministerial building commission.39 In the aftermath of 1848, Karl Ludwig Friedrich von Hinckeldey, the Polizeipräsident, had his power massively expanded; he militarized the police and created a secret police. The chief of the Berlin police was also the chief of all Prussian police.40 As Berlin concentrated liberal civil society and cultural power, liberals worked to reform Berlin politics. Prominent left-­liberal reformers included the physician Rudolf Virchow, founder of the Progressive Party, opponent of Bismarck, and member of the city council and of the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus, and Theodor Mommsen, a jurist and historian, a Prussian legislator from 1873 to 1882, and a member of the Reichstag from 1881 to 1882. Berlin also had a number of prominent liberal Oberbürgermeisters: Karl Theodor Seydel, who served from 1862 to 1873; Arthur Hobrecht, a National Liberal in office from 1873 to 1878; and Max von Forckenbeck, a member of various splitting and joining left-­liberal parties, who served for fourteen years after Hobrecht.\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n33\n\nRobert Zelle, Martin Kirschner, and Adolf Wermuth, the first mayors of the twentieth century, were also cut from this same left-­liberal cloth. In addition, Berlin was home to the liberal anti-­Bismarck press, which included Rudolf Mosse’s Vossische Zeitung, Peter Langmann’s Berliner Tageblatt, Eugene Richter’s Tribune, Leopold Ullstein’s Berliner Morgenpost and Berliner Zeitung, and Maximillian Harden’s Zukünft.41 The Socialists considered Berlin to be theirs and the capital of the German labour movement both politically and culturally, even if this was meaningless electorally under the prevailing political structure. Despite Berlin’s prominent role in the working-­class movement, the historiography of the politics of the local working-­class movement is relatively short. It narrates the numerical growth of the working class as well as the banning and subsequent legalization of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), its rapidly growing membership, and its success in labour conflicts and in the ballot box.42 Once Kaiser Wilhelm II lifted the ban on the Social Democratic Party (SPD) participation in elections in 1890, the SPD was increasingly able to overcome the three-­tier voting system and vote their members onto city councils. Moreover, even though the party representatives were illegal, they managed to get their members onto the ballot as independents. Berlin was a major industrial centre – closer to Chicago in character than to London or Paris – and so had a large working class. The political and organizational leaders of the party included Berliners like the party founder August Bebel; head of the Socialist unions, Carl Legien; and the millionaire party financial backer and the first representative in both the Reichstag and the city council, Paul Singer. The revisionist Eduard Bernstein was a Berliner, as were the revolutionaries Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Finally, the main press organ of the Socialists, Vorwärts, was centred in Berlin.43 The expanding social diversity of the councils closely coincided with the wealthiest families removing themselves from local politics in response to both the changing character of the councils and the demands of their businesses.44 However, the concerted entry of the SPD into local politics, by its own assessment, came relatively late. In 1902, for example, Hugo Lindemann, a Socialist municipal expert, argued that the historical conditions that made the state and the Reich the centre of power, and thus of agitation, had begun to change: the growth of the union movement, the Social Democratic Party, and industrialization in Greater Berlin challenged municipal electoral representation as well as the municipal, state, and Reich welfare apparatus, and in important ways put liberals on the defensive.\n\n34\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nBetween 1894 and 1905 the number of unionized food workers in Berlin nearly quadrupled, unionized service workers grew more than six times, unionized building workers more than eleven times, metalworkers more than seven times, woodworkers more than three times, clothing and leather workers four times, and workers in the paper and publishing industry more than three times. Together the unionized workers in Berlin expanded by nearly 485 per cent, from 38,152 to 223,077.45 Because of the growth of the municipal welfare system, the city had become a key battleground for Socialists. Lindemann’s main concern was the full autonomy of the municipality from the state and from there, reforms in voting laws and social welfare.46 Finally, Berlin was a massive centre of military authority. The capital of a rapidly ascending world power, Berlin had a martial tradition older than its metropolitan character. In many ways Berlin was an armed camp, and the state focused the military’s attention domestically, as the working-­class population grew and became radicalized. Military parades played an important role in the culture of the capital, and at the start of the First World War, Greater Berlin could be considered the largest military base in central Europe.47 Before 1860 the military so dominated the municipal bodies that it could circumvent most liberal reforms. After the 1860s the military was integrated into the built environment of Berlin, dotted with armament factories and depots, barracks, uniform factories, and administrative buildings.48 The military played a central and exalted role in the culture of civil society in Berlin. In the tourist literature for the Berlin Business Exhibition of 1896, for instance, an article claimed, “The Berliner, in general, loves the military and grants it a preferential position … in civilian life.” Furthermore, “Each offence against this special position strikes the Berliner … unpleasantly and brings censure.” This state of affairs, the booster explained, was “presumed by soldiers and non-­commissioned officers” and only increased in degree with higher ranks. If a soldier were to act “rapidly and independently under private responsibility” and out of “a strongly developed expression of self-­confidence,” no one could possibly object. The booster continued, “On the other hand, a strict condemnation in the public will meet a person who conducts himself inappropriately toward a military figure.” Even in the “low classes of the population,” one would find “unexpected appreciation” of the military, and an officer who would “nearly never meet a h ­ ostile … action in the public.”49\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n35\n\nThis statement was both descriptive and proscriptive. The Prussian state deployed the military to quell social conflicts with Socialists, Poles, Catholics, and, early on, liberals. However, the 1889 national miners’ strike and the legalization of the SPD forced the military to reconsider the practicality of the use of the military to quell popular protest. (The military and upper levels of the state planned for a violent and general repression of Social Democracy until 1918.)50 Like liberals before them, Socialists knew that Prussian militarism was not only about fighting an external enemy, but also about repressing internal foes.51 As Karl Liebknecht commented in 1907 in a lecture that led to an eighteen-­month prison sentence for treason, any police action against the striking working class implied a military threat, where, behind the police and gendarmerie, the military was “always ready to help even with the everyday work.”52 The Berlin Garrison remained directed towards internal security, despite the extension of civil authority, especially when Berlin became the Reich capital. Guards constantly protected royal, military, and major civil office buildings, residences, and individuals.53 As Alexander Schwab noted, the military located the barracks in the city strategically throughout working-­class districts to project military power so that “the city centre with its political and commercial office buildings, with government, banks, business houses and newspaper districts, [could be quickly walled off] against actions in the outskirts” where workers lived, isolating rioting workers.54 The problem of municipal administration was politically contentious during the nineteenth century, and in Berlin it took specific forms because of that city’s position as capital, as a city with a large and radical working class, and as one with a large and integrated military presence. The form and content of municipal administration and municipal politics became a key point of disputation for liberal politics in Germany in general and in Berlin in particular. Although liberal activists or Prussian bureaucrats could carry out liberal reforms as a revolutionary project or as an ameliorative undertaking, they envisioned a separation of powers between legislative and executive powers and a constitutional legal structure where the “law [was] king,” not to mention adequately abstract and general. It presupposed that property-­holding citizens, at first, and later all citizens, created the sovereignty of the government and guided its politics. Furthermore, these legal conditions were intended to make free and equal exchange possible, to open all occupations to all people, and to defend private property.\n\n36\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nMunicipal Administration and Industrial Capitalism The intensive and extensive industrialization in Berlin contributed to the crisis of liberalism and the transformation in the form, function, and perception of Greater Berlin from ones structured by liberal assumptions about the world to ones structured by corporatist principles. During the nineteenth century, capitalism changed cities and subsequently their government, introducing large-­scale industry, socioeconomic disparities, migrant farmer-­peasants, and problems of the built environment. Social forces, like industrialization and proletarianization of neighbourhoods and towns, played a fundamental role in constituting the problems of Greater Berlin. The politics of Greater Berlin both facilitated the growth of these problems and responded to them. This development transfigured municipal government, the territory of the municipality, and urban space. Berlin’s urbanization belongs in the context of global urbanization and industrialization, as well as their historiography. This section of the chapter will argue that this industrialization transformed the economic geography of the region in a manner that was similar to the ways it transformed other large cities of the period: it created new responsibilities for the municipality, and ultimately it pressured administrations to reterritorialize the municipality, the state, and the Reich. In the 1950s, urban history, as part of a broader project to understand society as a totality, relied on statistics and, with social history, qualitatively changed historiography. In the United States, Arthur Schlesinger Sr, Oscar Handlin, and Blake McKelvey practise a synthetic historiography that aimed at studying urban society rather than urban politicians.55 McKelvey seeks to grasp “multiple urban developments” that appear as elements in a total historical process through analysis of demographic transformations. He suggests that the modern city was organized by a number of antitheses: “diffusion versus centralization, heterogeneity versus standardization, expressionism versus planning, to mention only a few.”56 This tendency to understand urban questions through antitheses was and is not specific to an American context, and as we shall see, many of these same antitheses structure German urbanism. Political historiography and social historiography both, though to differing degrees, assumed a relationship between urbanization, industrialization, and modernization that they did not explain. This category, “modernization,” groups together a variety of social processes, such\n\nThe Rise of Industrial Berlin\n\n37\n\nas bureaucratization, democratization, industrialization, and urbanization and posits a connection between these processes but does not explain the relationships among them. Modernization has acquired several contradictory meanings over the course of the twentieth century: from increasing state intervention in the economy in the 1960s to removing the state from the economy in the 1980s. In the realm of urban questions, increasing population density and industrial concentration were considered processes of “modernization” until roughly the eve of the Second World War. After about 1945, the suburbanization of industry and population were considered processes of “modernization.” Since the 1980s, a de-­industrialized re-­concentration of population in cities is considered “modernization.” Many historians criticize “modernization” by attacking the teleological assumption that supposedly all societies develop along the same path in favour of the idea of multiple modernities. However, the idea of multiple modernities does not address the relationships among the different social processes gathered under the heading “modernization.” This has important implications for this book, which examines a transformation from one vision of what a modern city should be into quite a different vision. This book argues, that capitalism, understood as a set of social relations and processes that constitute a historically specific form of society and culture, can address the contradictory shifts in the meaning of modernity. While the political history-­ oriented city biographies assume that industrialization and urbanization proceeded hand-­in-­hand as part of a natural process of modernization, the social history of the city investigates this relationship more deeply, though still regarding them as separate processes. For example, Wolfgang Köllmann details the ways that they combined and intimately reinforced each other, fundamentally transforming the social and economic life of both the city and the country.57 Eric Lampard and Oscar Handlin, both historians of the United States, similarly argue that urbanization and industrialization concentrated productive activity in cities, drew masses of workers into the cities, and facilitated economic growth by creating systems for the division of labour.58 Lampard argues that to understand the empirical details, the complexity of the modern city and its dynamics demanded a level of theorization and abstraction that was not necessary for political history.59 Berlin rapidly and intensively urbanized and industrialized, making the crisis of liberalism especially acute. Population growth began to accelerate in 1841 in Berlin and its Brandenburg hinterland, but it remained a fortress and garrison city with a limited industrial sphere,\n\n38\n\nUrban Transformations\n\nwhich was focused on milit"
