Ever since the late eighteenth century, Hungarian intellectuals molded public opinion, launched new political movements, and alternately bolstered and undermined the existing government. All this was taken for granted by Hungarians: if the country's professional politicians were traditionally short-sighted and ruthless, true leadership rightfully belonged to the more imaginative and graceful literati. Even the avowedly anti-intellectual regime of Admiral Nicholas Horthy could not prevent the literati from dazzling the nation with magnificent revolutionary programs. And the intellectuals were taken so seriously that in 1945 several were given leading political positions. As an adult, I came to recognize the heavy debt that Hungarian literati owed to the men of ideas abroad. Just as the previous generation had looked to Paris for inspiration, the Hungarian intellectuals of the interwar period, whether Communists, democrats, populists, conservative revolutionaries, or fascists, looked to Berlin. But the German intellectuals, to whom I inevitably turned, proved to have had neither power nor influence in their political world. In twentieth-century Hungary the literati were at least partly responsible for two revolutions, those of 1918-1919 and 1956, and for the political and social ferment of other years. Their brilliant German counterparts achieved almost nothing. My first attempt to understand why led to a doctoral dissertation, written at Columbia University, on Carl von Ossietzky, a martyr among the German left-wing literati. More comprehensive attempts led to the present work.\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nI wish to thank the many friends and acquaintances who let me share their knowledge of Weimar Germany; some gave me valuable information and I would like to record their names. Heinz Pol, Kurt R. Grossmann, Kurt Hiller, Walther Karsch, Hilde Walter, and the late Manfred George, all former writers of the Weltbiihne, told me of the journal and of their own Weimar experiences. Raimund Koplin and Norbert Muhlen, writers, and Hellmut Jaesrich, editor of the Berlin Der Monat, permitted me to draw on their expert knowledge of German affairs. Ferdinand Fried, Giselher Wirsing, and the late Hans Zehrer, all former writers of the Tat, and the late Rudolf Pechel, editor of the Deutsche Rundschau, described to me their days as conservatives and conservative revolutionaries of Weimar and their polemics with the left-wing intellectuals. Reverend Hanno Stapel in Hamburg opened to me the literary Nachlass of his father, Wilhelm Stapel; Mary GeroldTucholsky put documents at my disposal from the rich Tucholsky archives in Rottach-Egern, Bavaria. The government of the German Federal Republic provided a fellowship which permitted me to spend the year 1960-1961 in Heidelberg garnering material; the Columbia University Council for Research in the Social Sciences gave me a grant for the summer of 1966 to aid in the writing of the manuscript; the European Institute of Columbia University (Director Professor Philip E. Mosely) helped cover the costs of typing the manuscript. My heartfelt thanks to these benefactors. I would like to thank Professor Werner Conze and Dr. Wolfgang Schieder of the University of Heidelberg for their valuable advice. Of my American friends and advisers, special gratitude is due to Professors Peter Gay of Columbia University; Robert A. Kann and Harold L. Poor of Rutgers University; Klemens von Klemperer and Allan Mitchell of Smith College; Henry L. Roberts of Dartmouth College; Helmut Gruber of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and Werner T. Angress of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Some of them spent many hours trying to argue me out of false conceptions; others read and corrected the manuscript in one or all its forms. Of Professor Fritz Stern, my friend, colleague, and master at Columbia University, I can say only that without him I would be neither a writer nor a teacher. Mr. Max Knight of the University of California Press helped me immeasurably. His assistance I can only interpret as love for the profession and for the subject matter of which he is in any case a foremost expert. I received valuable assistance from several Ph.D. candidates at\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nColumbia University. Miss Manuela Dobos-Schleicher did extensive research for me and wrote an outline for some sections; more importantly, through the brilliant mind of this young left-wing intellectual, I came to a closer understanding of her spiritual antecedents. Miss Ingrun Lafleur, Miss Sophia Sluzar, and Mr. Trevor Hope did valuable research for me and read parts of my manuscript. Mrs. Florence Aranov, Miss Ene Sirvet, and Mrs. Hilda McArthur typed the manuscript, the first two out of generosity, the third professionally, but all three with expert care and great forbearance. My wife—herself a writer—edited, reedited, and again reedited the manuscript. She also raised a child while I was writing. And our threeyear-old daughter viewed my manuscript as so many more sheets to be scribbled on: I am indebted to her for this new perspective of my work.

They appointed themselves the conscience of Germany and as such, in the period leading to the National Socialist takeover, they were singularly unsuccessful. But they were a vibrant part of the Weimar scene and it is surprising that, until now, their politics have been given so little scholarly attention. Historians have concentrated largely on the ideologies and behavior of the Right in Weimar; the studies that have been made of the Left have been confined to individual political parties. The most vociferous and consistent opposition to the nationalists, however, came not from the hesitant liberals or Social Democrats, nor from the supremely inconsistent and suicidal Communists, but from the left-wing intellectuals. Moreover, these literati, and such Communists as Bertolt Brecht, Ludwig Renn, Erwin Piscator, and Anna Seghers, to whom they stood very close, were responsible for much of the cultural brilliance and vitality of the Weimar period. Die Weltbuhne, a weekly journal which printed the views of most of these literati, is the subject of this study. There were various terms used to designate this band of intellectuals. Some called them \"radical democrats,\" some \"radical humanists,\" and others \"radical leftists.\" Thomas Mann spoke of \"the left Notes indicated by arabic numerals follow the text in the back of the book.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nside of social philosophy,\" and Heinrich Mann of \"revolutionary democracy.\" 1 \"Left-wing intellectual\" is adopted here because it was the term most familiar to the politically articulate of that period. Linker Intellektuelle in the Weimar days evoked images in the public mind which varied from the lone defender of justice or humanity— Prometheus or Don Quixote?—to the offensive Asphaltliterat, a despicable product of big-city immorality engaged in the subversion of sacred German values. Their enemies also called the left-wing intellectuals Rulturbolschewisten. Carl von Ossietzky, an editor of the Weltbiihne, showed that the latter term was most elastic. The Kulturbolschewist, he wrote in 1931,2 was the latest version of the eternal subversive: in the Middle Ages he was called a witch; under Bismarck \"he wore royal Hannoverian Junker boots, a worker's beret, a red shirt and a black cassock. In his inner pocket he carried the statutes of a freemasonic lodge and a freshly printed copy of the Vossische Zeitung.\" * In the twentieth century, the eternal subversive became a\n\nKulturbohchewist.\n\nKulturbolschewismus is when Conductor Klemperer takes tempi different from his colleague Furtwangler, when a painter sweeps a color into his sunset not seen in Lower Pomerania; when one favors birth control; when one builds a house with a flat roof; when a Caesarean birth is shown on the screen; when one admires the performance of Charlie Chaplin and the mathematical wizardry of Albert Einstein. This is called cultural Bolshevism and a personal favor rendered to Herr Stalin. It is also the democratic mentality of the brothers Mann, a piece of music by Hindemith or Weill, and is to be identified with the hysterical insistence of a madman for a law giving him the permission to marry his own grandmother.3 The camp of cultural Bolshevism's enemies is large, wrote Ossietzky. It includes the \"two Josephs\": Joseph Goebbels and Joseph Wirth,\" P. N. Cossmann,\" and the entire bourgeois press. It includes the Social * Die Vossische Zeitung, the oldest daily newspaper in Berlin (founded in 1704) opposed Bismarck on progressive liberal grounds. \"Joseph Wirth (1879-1956), leader of the democratic wing of the Catholic Center Party (\"Zentrum\"), was Reich Chancellor from October 1921 to November 1922. After World War II, Wirth headed a small political movement for the reunification of Germany through East-West reconciliation. In 1955, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for Peace. The coupling of this staunch republican with Goebbels was certainly not accidental. Ossietzky was suspicious of Wirth and his \"black\" party. 0 Paul Nikolaus Cossmann (1869-1942), a Catholic conservative, was the editor from 1905 to 1933 of the Süddeutsche Monatshefte. During World War I, Cossmann demanded total victory. In 1922, he was instrumental in staging the anti-Versailles \"War Guilt Trial,' yet he was also an opponent of the \"Stab in the Back\" legend. In 1930, he opened the pages of his journal to both Jews and\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nDemocrats whose press avoids this term in print but echoes it in spirit. And the Communists? Well, \"when one reads what feelings certain Communist papers express towards the writers of the Weltbühne, one often feels like offering the Communists a helping hand and urging them to go ahead: 'But children, say it! You too would love to call us cultural Bolshevists. Say it, at last!'\" 4 The left-wing intellectual could often overcome the isolation traditionally imposed on the free publicist by thinking of himself as a better sort of German who belonged to das andere Deutschland, \"the other Germany.\"d On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Weltbühne, Kurt Tucholsky, another editor of the journal, wrote: \"As long as Die Weltbühne will be Die Weltbühne, we will give it our utmost. And this utmost will serve a good cause . . . that of transforming this Teutschland * into a Deutschland, of proving to all that, besides Hitler, Hugenberg, and those fish-eyed academicians of the year 1930, there are also other Germans in Germany.\" 5 The left-wing intellectuals continually haggled over their identity as well as their purpose. Yet perhaps the best, because the most characteristic, formulation of their views comes not from a Weimar manifesto but from a recent autobiographical novel by Leonhard Frank, an expressionist writer and a collaborator of the Weltbühne. The title of the work itself, Links wo das Herz ist (\"Heart on the Left\") aptly describes the tenor of the left-wing intellectual's beliefs. Frank says about his hero: He believes that under a capitalist economy . . . human virtues, both in the rich and the poor, are unable to develop. It says much for men and women that in an economic order of extreme inequality they are as good as they are. He believes that history is moving, impelled by its own laws, towards a Socialist economy; that the oppressed, whether individuals or nations, act in their forward drive as executive organs of history, as grains of sand in the wheels of what is at present the established system. He proclaims to all, whether they wish to hear or not, that the grains of sand anti-Semites in a debate on the Jewish question in Germany. Cossmann loathed the Asphaltliteratur of the period and hailed Hans Grimm (Volk ohne Raum) and other völkisch authors. Of Jewish descent, Cossmann died in the ghetto of Theresienstadt. 4 The expression \"the other Germany\" probably originates from the title of the pacifist journal, Das andere Deutschland, founded in January 1920 by Friedrioh Küster in Hägen, Westphalia. In Hitler s era it was used extensively by the German emigres and the Western press in a careful attempt to differentiate between \"good\" and \"bad\" Germans. See, for instance, Erika and Klaus Mann, The Other Germany (New York, 1940). * Teutschland is an archaic form occasionally used both by the conservatives and their opponents to designate traditional, historic Germany.\n\n4\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nwill triumph, for the movement towards the Socialist economy cannot be stayed. . . . He believes that the acquisitive economic system [Habenhaben-haben Wirtschaftsordnung] will be replaced, even without an atomic war, before the dawn of a new century, by a Socialist economic order. He believes that our children's grandchildren may have greater happiness than we have ever been allowed to know. . . . He believes that man can and will become humane only when nothing compels him to be inhumane. He believes in mankind for he accepts what he sees in the eyes of innocent children.6 Socialism, democracy, and a belief in the inherent goodness of man were the main tenets of the left-wing intellectual creed. A child of the Enlightenment and of the French Revolution, the left-wing intellectual dreamed of a world where the heretofore impossible combination of peace, individual liberty, and social equality would prevail. He fondly wished to \"debarbarize\" society and \"unromanticize\" war if by no other means than by his burlesque assaults upon solemnity and cruelty. He believed that society could and should be changed, that it is the inherent right of man to be happy, and that world solidarity was far from being a hopeless proposition. Such views were obviously compatible with the platforms of the great democratic and socialist parties, and some left-wing intellectuals gave these parties their allegiance. But those who did so invariably felt uneasy. Had the Independent Socialist Party,' a product of the Great War, survived the troubled postwar years, it would probably have attracted most of these intellectuals. But the USPD disappeared in 1922. So it was that the left-wing intellectual in the SPD* reproached his leaders for betraying the cause of the German workers to the bourgeoisie; that his counterpart in the K P D 1 resented his leaders for sacrificing the interest of the German workers to that of the party apparatus, and that the left-wing intellectual in the DDP 1 imputed to his leaders the surrender of free thought to bigotry and the betrayal of the educated man's foremost task: the defense of the lower classes. In every instance, the left-wing intellectuals reproached their parties for ignoring the literati and entrusting leadership to dullwitted functionaries. Most of them were not so unrealistic as the phif \"Unabhängige sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\" (USPD). Its members were often called the \"Independents.\" ' \"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands,\" the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Its members were also often called Majority Socialists. 11 \"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands,\" the Communist Party of Germany. It originated from the war-time \"Spartakus\" movement. 1 \"Deutsche Demokratische Partei,\" the German Democratic Party—the organization of the liberal and republican German bourgeoisie.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nlosopher Kurt Hiller who pleaded for a Logokratie, a government of philosopher-kings where \"the morally and intellectually superior would reign.\"7 What all of them did demand was a Vergeistigung, an \"intellectualization\" of the political life of Germany. There was a great deal of naivete in these aspirations. Far removed from political power, even from its illegitimate or revolutionary variety, the left-wing intellectuals often eschewed considerations of means and spun out lovely visions of what might be. In political terms, their dedication to the good of mankind was insufficient, their claims often impossible. Yet perhaps what Germany needed was to tackle the impossible. The republican moderate who preached compromise with the Right masked his fear of forceful action, as did the Communist militant who, because he was preparing for the \"final struggle,\" refused to work honestly with the republicans, not to speak of non-Communist workers. In the final analysis, both paved the way for the triumph of Hitler. The revolution for which the left-wing intellectuals clamored in the pages of the Weltbiihne, however imprecisely defined, was meant to revitalize both republicans and Communists, and to bring them together on a common platform of antifascist action. \"Die Weltbuhnel\" wrote Kurt Hiller in his recent reminiscences, \"It wasn't a journal. It was an institution! It wasn't the journal of the so-called homeless Left alone; it belonged to those who had a home but weren't quite satisfied. . . . Around 1930 . . . it was considered uncouth not to have read the latest issue of the Weltbiihne.\"8 Hiller was one of the journal's main contributors, but other writers, much less rhapsodic about Die Weltbiihne, had no hesitation either in giving it its due: \"The majority of its [Die Weltbiihne's] readers were recruited from among coffeehouse intellectuals (Literaten), bohemian types, students, agnostics, sceptics,\" writes Hermann Behr, a liberal critic of the left-wing intellectuals, \"yet thanks to the sharp and masterly style of its articles, it came to be regarded as the best-written journal in Germany and its influence extended far beyond the circle of its main readers.\" 9 Nor were the Weltbiihne's rightist enemies unappreciative of its influence and significance. When, on the night of May 11, 1933, on the Opera Square in Berlin, Nationalist1 and National-Socialist stu1 The term \"nationalist\" had a dual meaning in Weimar politics designating ( 1 ) all right-wing enemies of the republic, ( 2 ) members of the \"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\" or DNVP (German Nationalist Party), the major conservative political movement which concluded a tactical alliance in the early 1930's with Hitler's \"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\" or NSDAP (National\n\n6\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\ndents and professors ceremoniously burned piles of books, student \"callers\" enumerated the particular sins of the authors. Of the fifteen they named, thirteen had, at one time or another, made contributions to the Weltbühne. Of the two others, one, Theodor Wolff,* editor of the Berliner Tageblatt, was a close friend of the Weltbühne. The other was Karl Marx.10 Established in 1905 in Berlin as Die Schaubühne (\"The Theatrical Stage\"), this weekly organ of the performing arts began to dabble in politics in the years immediately preceding World War I. Thereafter, columns dealing with political issues multiplied, and with the change of the journal's name in 1918 to Die Weltbühne (The World Stage), politics dominated its pages. This publication attracted hundreds of contributors, German and foreign. They delighted in the journal's self-sufficiency—it was independent of sponsors and advertisers—in its casual and free atmosphere, its courage, the sarcastic violence of its style, in its \"causes\" and its campaigns, and in the talents of its three successive editors, Jacobsohn, Tucholsky, and Ossietzky. Siegfried Jacobsohn, the journal's founder, and its editor until 1926, was a formidable theater critic and a demanding stylist; he also had a remarkable political flair. Kurt Tucholskys editorship was brief (1926-1927), but as the journal's star contributor, he issued a torrent of polemical writings marked by extraordinary insight. He was, in turn, exasperatingly arrogant, jocularly kind, and naive; today, he is one of the prophets of German youth. Carl von Ossietzky, editor in chief between 1927 and 1933, and a more enigmatic personality, was a firstclass journalist and a man of great courage. Later he achieved world fame as a prisoner of the Gestapo and as the recipient—while still a prisoner—of the Nobel Prize for Peace. He died in 1938, still in the hands of the Nazis. We must not, however, exaggerate the importance of the Weltbühne. There were other left-wing intellectual publications. Das Tage-Buch, a weekly journal founded in 1920, resembled Die Weltbühne in style, in format, in its manifold preoccupations, and often in its political message. Led by two able journalists, Stefan Grossmann and Leopold Schwarzschild, it was often more successful Socialist Party). Members of the DNVP are often referred to in English as \"Nationalists\" (with a capital \" N \" ) in an attempt to distinguish them from other members of the rightist or \"nationalist\" camp. * A brief resumé on Theodor Wolff, as well as on some other individuals, journals, and political organizations frequently mentioned in the pages of the Weltbühne is included in Appendix II. This Appendix contains information on some of the \"Friends and Enemies\" of the Weltbiihne.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nin attracting famous names, especially from abroad. Das Tage-Buch appealed to the same audience as did Die Weltbiihne and employed almost the same writers (Ossietzky, for instance, came from the Tage-Buch to the Weltbiihne)—with little love lost between the pugnacious Jacobsohn and the editors of the rival paper. If Die Weltbiihne and not Das Tage-Buch was chosen here for examination, it is because Das Tage-Buch was less radical and, as years went by, became increasingly friendly to the failing republic, whereas Die Weltbiihne stepped up its attacks.1 Das Tage-Buch had no revolutionary message while Die Weltbiihne was commonly accepted as the principal paper of the radical writers. A certain magic surrounded the name of the Weltbiihne which the rival paper never enjoyed. Ultimately, the journal and its circle were chosen for this study as an example: a start on the very difficult problem of left-wing intellectual politics in the Weimar era. There were at least two other noteworthy journals: Die Zukunft, edited by Maximilian Harden, and Die Fackel, edited by the brilliant Karl Kraus. Both were highly controversial and their editors fiercely hated. More will be said about them later. What is significant here is that in the Weimar era the importance of these journals had begun to decline. Disillusionment—and a brutal beating by \"patriotic\" assailants—forced Harden, this unique political critic of the Wilhelmian era, to put an end to Die Zukunft. As for the Viennese Karl Kraus, his savage political and social commentaries were relished by the sophisticated reader but Die Fackel was little more than a private mouthpiece. Whether Kraus was truly of the Left is at least doubtful. Moreover, what had sounded like welcome nonconformity on the part of Kraus in the old regime became plain viciousness in the republican era. A maniacal hatred for the liberal press and politicians eventually distorted Kraus's vision of the dangers from the Right and—in the words of Arnold Zweig—he \"abandoned his struggle against tyranny at the very moment when it was most needed, namely in 1933.\" 11 The left-wing intellectuals did not write for the Weltbiihne alone. Those who were members of political parties contributed to the party organs; others wrote for the officially nonaffiliated Miinzenberg concern. This curious private chain of newspapers and journals, cleverly directed by Willi Miinzenberg, a functionary of the Comintern in Germany, succeeded in attracting many who might otherwise have 1 After 1933, the exile editions of the two papers no longer resembled each other: Die Weltbiihne was gradually taken over by Communists and Das TageBuch became more and more critical of Communists tactics.\n\n8\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\nnever written for the Communist press. In addition, many in the Weltbühne worked for the big liberal and democratic dailies. The Berliner Tageblatt owned by the great Mosse concern and also the newspapers of the more prestigious House of Ullstein were open to the left-wing intellectuals and published some of their best pieces. There was undoubtedly some opportunism in this willingness to be in print on opposite sides, but the attraction of the good life in Berlin was irresistible and asceticism unknown to these writers. Mass-circulation papers paid far better than Die Weltbühne. What motivated this literary proliferation, however, was more likely the fact that the leftwing intellectuals, justifiably convinced they had something to say, were prepared to say it anywhere in the corridors of Left or Center. There was also a certain hauteur in their feeling that they would remain unsullied. Weren't they, after all, the uncrowned rulers of the Berlin stage and of literary life? Weren't many in the Weltbühne circle —Heinrich Mann, Alfred Polgar, Erich Kästner, Alfred Döblin, Leonhard Frank, Theodor Plievier, Carl Zuckmayer, René Schickele, Lion Feuchtwanger, Fritz von Unruh, Ernst Toller, Arnold Zweig—among the great novelists, essayists, and dramatists of Weimar? It is hard and perhaps unjust to attribute uniformity of any kind to men of this caliber, to intellectuals who held so tenaciously to the sovereignty of their minds. But this particular brand of stubbornness and the things they did share in common—their Utopias, their ambivalences, their ideals, their passions, and their radicalism—clearly bind them. And these intellectuals were united further, in a more significant way, by their certainty that revolution alone could save Weimar Germany. In the attempt by others to bind them, they have been characterized as \"homeless,\" an oft-repeated political epithet that has a much wider meaning. Although very German in some of their characteristics—idealism, sentimentality, undialectical either-or-ness, unwillingness to accept halfway measures like the republic—they were out of place in Germany. In a country where society's ideal was the functionary, where everybody wished to belong, they generally shied away from affiliation. In a country where the bourgeois flaunted his idealism and the apolitical nature of his existence—and then voted the nationalist ticket—they threw themselves into politics with the enthusiasm of converts. In a culture generally characterized by provincialism, bigotry, and narrow nationalism, they believed themselves the first true cosmopolitans since the lonely giants Marx, Engels, Nietzsche, and Burckhardt.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nFurthermore, the writers of the Weltbiihne were the archetypes of a Central European phenomenon: the journalist who was also a literary figure, an intellectual, a social critic, a reformer, and a revolutionary. They combined within themselves features of the bourgeois, the artist-intellectual, and the revolutionist—a volatile blend of personality ingredients which accounts for much of their personal and artistic ambiguity. In an age of specialization, it is refreshing, and sometimes exasperating, to reckon with those who thought themselves protean. They considered themselves \"tribunes of the German people\"—guardians and innovators who, because they were not covered with dust as were the Bonzen (the bosses) of political parties, knew better how society ought to be run than Germany's tired bureaucrats. Finally, left-wing intellectual politics in Weimar Germany has its parallels in the efforts of Western European literati in the late 1930s. The British poet or French writer in the Spanish republican trenches had his precursor in the Weimar man of letters who, like his counterpart in the International Brigade, fought militarism, intolerance, and social injustice, and believed that international Communism was an ally in this struggle. Because of the unique character of Weimar, the writers of the Weltbiihne were confronted, well before their Western counterparts, with fascism, popular ennui, political disengagement, and the collapse of republican and democratic ideas. Their unsuccessful call for a unity of antifascists was a tragic rehearsal for the Popular Front appeals in the late 1930's when Western literati belatedly tried to avert the catastrophe which had engulfed Germany in 1933.\n\nChapter I\n\nTHE WRITERS OF THE WELTBUHNE BERLIN\n\n\"Travel across the world from the North Pole to the South Pole\"— wrote Kurt Tucholsky—\"you will find that everything takes place among two hundred people.\"1 So it must have seemed to the buoyant literary establishment of the 1920s in Berlin where Doblin wrote Berlin Alexanderplatz and Brecht Die Dreigroschenoper; where Erwin Piscator crowded the stage with mechanical devices and Leopold Jessner used only a stairway; where Fritz Lang produced Dr. Mabuse and Werner Krauss frightened his audience in the \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\"; where Emil Jannings acted, Lotte Lenya sang, and Kurt Weill composed. It was the Weltbuhne's achievement to capture the moods of this particular world and to recruit most of Berlin's intellectual elite as collaborators. Only extreme—and fairly rare—political commitment, orthodox Communist or conservative, stopped a Berlin writer from contributing to the journal. The cultural eminence of Berlin was of relatively recent date, for Germany had traditionally been without a cultural center as well as without a political capital. Even after its elevation in 1871 to the rank of Imperial capital, Berlin, for a while, bore the marks of its original designation as a garrison town. But now it was gripped by the fever of real-estate speculation and its expansion in the 1870's, unguided by any architectural tradition, gave it the aspect of a Teutonic Chicago. Twenty years later it was culturally still overshadowed by Munich and the more gracious capitals of Germany's lesser princes.* What gradu* \"In implicit opposition to Berlin the southern capital of Munich seemed raffish and Bohemian. It was known as a city of painters and creative writers, of French influence, and of a teasing esprit frondeur. In the prevailing humorlessness\n\n13\n\n14\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nally invigorated its cultural life was the formation of the big newspaper concerns which had followed in the footsteps of big business, and the many new theaters where the newly affluent were invited to spend their money and to receive their weekly fare of shock and provocation in the form of theatrical \"realism\" and \"naturalism.\" By the early 1900's, Berlin was an important gathering place for artists who casually defied Imperial and bourgeois cultural standards, and cultivated everything that was artistically modern. Even so, it was only after 1918 that Berlin truly became Germany's cultural capital. The reason for this was political. While Munich turned savagely reactionary and most of the other great German cities remained conservative, Berlin suddenly became progressive. Not only was it now the seat of a republican Reich administration, but also that of democratic Prussia, and of two clashing, but active working-class parties. Of course, even in the Weimar era, Germany remained culturally decentralized to some degree. Leipzig continued to be the headquarters of Germany's book trade and of a radical and intelligent regional socialist movement; Frankfurt had a democratic university and the illustrious Frankfurter Zeitung; Cologne was the seat of German Catholicism, and Hamburg was always regarded as the window to Britain. Theaters flourished in these and dozens of smaller urban centers. But the small towns gradually fell into a cultural blight reflected in the decline of provincial journalism and its gradual submission to the big syndicated press of the nationalist-conservative Hugenberg variety. A victim of this blight was the Bauhaus school of Hugo Gropius and Wassily Kandinsky: in 1925, the citizens of Weimar expelled the Bauhaus artists from their town. Berlin harbored those who elsewhere might have been subjected to ridicule or persecution. Comintern agents, Dadaist poets, expressionist painters, anarchist philosophers, Sexualwissenschaftler, vegetarian and Esperantist prophets of a new humanity, Schnorrer (\"freeloaders\" —artists of coffeehouse indolence), courtesans, homosexuals, drug addicts, naked dancers, and apostles of nudist self-liberation, black marketeers, embezzlers, and professional criminals flourished in a city which was hungry for the new, the sensational, and the extreme. Moreover, Berlin became the cultural center of Central and Eastern of Wilhelmian Germany, the Munich review Simplizissimus was almost the only voice of irony and satire. . . . It was no accident that the young Thomas Mann— like many other refugees from the unsympathetic north—just after the turn of the century should have settled in Munich and associated himself with Simplizissimus.\" H. Stuart Hughes, Consciousness and Society (New York, 1958), 46.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbiihne\n\n15\n\nEurope as well. Those who now dictated public taste and morals, who enlightened, entertained, or corrupted their customers were not only Germans but Russian refugees from the Red and Hungarian refugees from the White terror, voluntary exiles from what was now a withering and poverty-stricken Vienna, Balkan revolutionaries, and Jewish victims of Ukrainian pograms.\" There was nothing degrading about being a newcomer to the city; it wasn't even important to have been bom a Prussian.' Of Tucholsky's two-hundred elite—or rather seventy-five, the appropriate figure for the story of the Weltbuhne— more than three-fourths were not natives of Berlin. Some were not even Germans but came from Austria, Hungary, the Ukraine, and Poland.\" The famous \"Berlin style\" of the 1920's was largely a product of these non-Berliners who forged new traditions in the theater, in art, in literature, and in journalism. The city's native inhabitants, speaking a delightful dialect and capable of a biting wit (immortalized, among others, by Tucholsky), were a world unto themselves. The talented outsiders who now peopled hospitable Berlin transformed the city from a political capital to a genuine nerve center of the nation, creating in the process a cosmopolitan audience for their cosmopolitan ideas. THREE GENERATIONS\n\nIn the Weimar era alone Die Weltbuhne attracted about three hundred contributors. To be sure, most of them wrote only a few articles but there were at least seventy-five who could be termed assiduous and important collaborators. Who they were, and the nature of their political message, will form the basis of the collective image of the Weltbuhne circle attempted in this study.\" The oldest member of the b The Hungarian Marxist philosopher Gyorgy LukAcs, the Austrian theater director Max Reinhardt, the Prague journalist Egon Erwin Kisch, the phenomenal operetta singer from Budapest, Gitta Alpdr, and the Polish embezzlers Leo and Willy Sklarek were some of these famous \"Berliners.\" \"This was not the case in Munich, for instance, where Bavarian particularism and xenophobia were rampant in the 1920's. d There was, among others, an astonishingly large number of Hungarian writers at the Weltbiihne, all Communists or left-wing Social Democrats, whom Tucholsky half jestingly accused of incurable nostalgia and chauvinism. * The choice of these seventy-five writers is, of necessity, arbitrary. For instance, such prolific contributors as Bemhard Citron, Adolf Weissman, Ossip Kalenter, Bruno Manuel, Frank Warschauer, Wolf Zucker, Hanns-Erich Kaminski had to be omitted because too little is known about them. In fact, the many literary and political \"Who is Who's\" of the period are of no great help to the researcher for they list mainly the officially honored luminaries of the time. Information on many of the writers was culled from contemporary accounts, autobiographies\n\n16\n\nWeimar Germany's\n\nLeft-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\nWeltbûhne circle, Georg Ledebour, an independent socialist politician and the Eugene Debs of German socialism, was born in 1850; the youngest, Walther Karsch, last editor of the journal in Weimar Germany, was born in 1906. Between these two extremes lay the three generations of the Weltbûhne: the oldest, which knew Bismarck and the aging William I; the middle generation, which achieved maturity under William II; and the youngest, which grew up during World War I. The oldest generation of the Weltbûhne was the most \"respectable,\" not only because of the advanced age of its members in the Weimar era, but because of their conviction that only moral means lead to moral ends. Having grown up in the atmosphere of confidence and bureaucratic probity which had characterized the Bismarckian era, and still firmly anchored in the upper-middle class milieu of their youth/ they were the least \"alienated\" of all Weltbûhne writers. Characteristically, most of them had traveled a long political road before they became radical democrats or socialists. The democrat and pacifist Hellmut von Gerlach began his political career as an antiSemite; 2 the pacifist Lothar Persius as a nationalist naval officer.3 It was in the Wilhelmian period that most of these men went into opposition. They were, of course, not alone among the intellectuals in opposing the Wilhelmian regime: some of the greatest lights of German culture—Max Weber, Friedrich Meinecke, Ernst Troeltsch, Thomas Mann, and Lujo Brentano—strongly objected to the philistinism of the German bourgeoisie and the coarseness of the Imperial court. But unquestioning patriotism moderated their opposition.4 Not so their counterparts among the Weltbûhne writers. The historian Ludwig Quidde risked imprisonment with a satire on the Kaiser; 8 Hellmut von Gerlach resigned as a civil servant and Lothar Persius as a naval officer; Heinrich Mann wrote Der Untertan (\"The Patrioteer\"), his derision of Germany's ruling classes, shortly before the (very rare), and the personal reminiscences of the survivors. For brief individual résumés on the \"seventy-five,\" see Appendix I. * Heinrich Mann, the brother of Thomas, was a Liibeck patrician; the theater critics Oskar Bie and Arthur Eloesser, and the writer Arthur Holitscher were sons of rich businessmen; Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, the founder of \"sexology,\" was the son of a Sanitatsrat (a physician decorated by the government); the democratic journalist Hellmut von Gerlach was a Junker; the pacifist General von Schoenaich the son of a landowning aristocrat; the historian Ludwig Quidde descended from a long line of civil servants and so did the pacifist Captain Persius whose father sat in the Prussian Upper House; the satirical writer Alexander Roda Roda ( Sândor Friedrich Rosenfeld) was the son of a bailiff who had been a career officer in the Austro-Hungarian army.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbiihne\n\n17\n\nwar.6 Furthermore, when the war broke out and Weber, Troeltsch, Meinecke, Brentano, and Thomas Mann threw their reservations to the four winds, the members of the Welthuhne's elder generation were among the first ones to join the antiwar organizations. After 1918, when Meinecke and the other giants of German culture became Vemunftsrepublikaner—republicans not by conviction but by reason —the members of the old Weltbiihne generation were enthusiastic republicans. The middle generation constituted the great majority of the Weltbiihne writers. Siegfried Jacobsohn, Kurt Tucholsky, and Carl von Ossietzky, the three successive editors of the journal, belonged to this generation, as did Alfred Polgar, Walter Mehring, Kurt Hiller, Ernst Toller, Rudolf Leonhard, Arnold Zweig, Walter Hasenclever, Leonhard Frank, Erich Miihsam, and a host of other famous collaborators. Turning into adults in the Wilhelmian age, this middle generation had experienced none of the political triumphs of the Bismarckian period. On the other hand they initiated, or participated in, the cultural awakening that marked the turn of the century. For them, Imperial Germany was an age of intellectual excitement, a prelude to some great cataclysm. They were the \"war generation\" who, as H. Stuart Hughes explains in his study of the conflict of generations in Western culture, doubted the wisdom of their elders and searched for a faith and an ideal. Their intellectual imagination had been aroused by the Russian revolution of 1905 and the first Moroccan crisis, the consequences of which they—\"the generation of 1905\" as Hughes terms them—had personal reasons to fear. \"It was this prospect of war service,\" writes Hughes, \"which most sharply marked off the new generation from those who had reached intellectual maturity in the 1890's.\"7 During World War I, this generation began to turn its cultural rebellion into a political crusade. The republic was to be its responsibility. The members of this generation demanded a new beginning but could not help making constant references to the Wilhelmian past. They called in the Weltbiihne for a republic unencumbered by the remnants of Imperial Germany but were nostalgic for an age which suddenly seemed invested with an aura of decency. To give only one example, these writers often compared postwar with prewar Social Democracy, and they could find in the postwar leaders none of the qualities of courage, honesty, and purposefulness of the old leadership. Little did it matter that the prewar leaders of the SPD had prepared the way for the post-1918 policy of that party. It was difficult for this generation not to fight the battles of the old, and even more\n\n18\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\ndifficult to detect, behind the figure of the authoritarian opponent, the shadow of the totalitarian enemy. As to the young \"postwar\" generation, it knew nothing of Imperial Germany. For them, the Kaiser meant war, in which some were called up to serve.\" Others were in school and were constantly hungry. \"The war, that's our parents,\" exclaimed the hero of Ernst Glaeser s popular novel, Jahrgang 1902. 8 They viewed the Weimar Republic not as an answer to Wilhelmian decadence (the concept of the old generation), nor as a perpetrator of the worst in Imperial Germany (the general opinion of the middle generation), but as a true beginning. Again, unlike their elders, they were immune to nostalgia and looked beyond the republic for a political solution. Composed mainly of journalists, the postwar generation of the Weltbuhne circle was more dynamic, more versatile, and more radical than their elders; their youth had been less secure and their world more agitated. Some changed their politics in a bewildering fashion. Unlike the oldest generation which moved gradually from a conservative to a democratic progressive position, they often started out on the extreme L e f t and changed later to an apolitical or strongly anti-Communist position. Arthur Koestler, Ernst Glaeser, Bruno Frei, Heinz Pol, Odon von Horvath, Gerhart Pohl were Communists or Communistsympathizers in the 1920s. Of these, only the Austrian journalist Bruno Frei is today an avowed Communist. Koestler s break with the Communist Party became a matter of world renown. 9 Ernst Glaeser, whose books were burned by the National Socialists on their first pyre, and who had to flee Germany, returned to his homeland in 1939 to become the editor of a German army newspaper. Glaeser, incidentally, was the only writer of the Weltbuhne to make his peace with Nazi Germany. The others of the young generation mostly went into exile; if they stayed in Germany, they either remained in opposition, or, at least, abstained from political writing.11 HERITAGE AND EDUCATION\n\nCommunists and Social Democrats were right in asserting that the writers of the Weltbuhne were bourgeois who had no contact with the ' At least three of these writers were soldiers in World War I. Four were too young for front line duty in that war, and two served in World War II (Walter Kiaulehn in the German and Arthur Koestler in the British army). 11 Gerhart Pohl, Walther Karsch, Walter Kiaulehn, and Erich Kastner chose to remain in National Socialist Germany. Axel Eggebrecht was put in concentration camp and, after his release, became an office worker. The rest of the young generation: Bruno Frei, Odon von Horvath, Hermann Kesten, Arthur Koestler, and Heinz Pol fled abroad.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbiihne\n\n19\n\nmasses: even those among them who belonged to the Communist Party seldom addressed the workers directly. Moreover, some of them showed distinctly upper-middle-class inclinations. Wasn't, after all, their intellectual and political idol the renegade Communist Paul Levi, a successful and wealthy lawyer, a connoisseur of antiques, and of beautiful women? And of Kurt Tucholsky, an admirer wrote: \"There was nothing conspicuous about his appearance. He was always soberly and meticulously dressed. He put great emphasis on cleanliness and he had inordinately good manners. He was an accomplished gentleman; nay an aristocrat.\"10 Or as Kurt Hiller described his encounter in 1919 with Carl von Ossietzky: \"Ossietzky visited me. I recall it well. He came wearing a frockcoat and gave me frightfully stiff bows.\" 11 The members of the Weltbiihne circle were born into upper-middle-class or middle-class families. Their fathers were physicians, professors, music teachers, civil servants, landowners, wholesale merchants, or manufacturers. Even among these \"better people,\" members of the commercial, financial, and professional bourgeoisie formed the vast majority. None of them was a proletarian, and there were only a few artisans and shopkeepers, as well as two fairly well-to-do peasants.1 There is nothing surprising about the professional distribution of the fathers (have not most socialist intellectuals been of bourgeois background?), but it certainly distinguishes the collaborators of the Weltbiihne from the writers of die conservative revolutionary Die Tat, whose fathers were mainly Protestant ministers, officers, or civil servants; or of the Communist Die Linkskurve, where bourgeois offspring were colleagues of genuine proletarians.12 Most of the Weltbiihne writers had received an excellent education. Only two, Leonhard Frank and the sailor-poet Joachim Ringelnatz were bona fide self-taught men. The others had attended a Gymnasium1 or a university, with the latter group forming a very large majority. Only the fact that about one-third of the \"academics\" did not care to acquire the coveted title of \"Herr Doktor\" shows that, at least for some of these intellectuals, creativity was a primary urge. There were among these publicists some practicing lawyers and physicians, two 1 The father of the pacifist expressionist writer René Schickele was a winegrower in Alsatia, the father of the left-radical journalist Kurt Kersten was an Urbauer, the owner of an ancestral holding in the Rhineland. 1 The Gymnasium, was equivalent to the French lycée and therefore more exclusive and demanding than the American high school. Its graduates were fullfledged gentlemen as they qualified both for officer's school in the army and for dueling.\n\n20\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\ncareer officers (both retired), and nine professors.1 The others drew a regular income as journalists, reporters, theater critics, editors, readers for publishing houses, or as unattached novelists, dramatists, and song writers. These writers were no Bohemians, not even of the coffeehouse variety.1 Although they traveled more and changed domiciles more often than the average Burger, most of them lived \"respectably.\" Only in their personal relations with women did they violate convention: several lived in common-law relationships (a popular practice in intellectual circles); some proudly exhibited a series of girl friends, and many were married at least twice. But here again most members of the first generation must be excepted. It was customary for the Right to call the left-wing intellectuals shirkers who, in \"characteristic un-German\" fashion, had evaded military service in wartime. This was a deliberate confusion of left-wing intellectual antimilitarist ideology with personal conduct. In fact, the left-wing intellectuals contributed to the creation of this malevolent legend by their campaign against the German practice of sizing up a civilian in terms of his military service. Nothing exasperated them more than the customary question: Haben Sie gedient? (Did you serve?). \"It is no business of the court of the republic, whether or not I served in the army of the former Kaiser,\" Ossietzky snapped at the examining judge in the course of one of his trials. Ossietzky, in fact, had served during the war. The enthusiasm with which some of these young intellectuals marched off into the war in 1914 has been written about a good deal. Ernst Toller, for instance, volunteered for the front in a mood which he later described as an \"emotional delirium.\"13 Almost one-third of the \"war generation\" saw front-line service and several were wounded. (Arnold Zweig was almost blinded at Ver* The historians Ludwig Quidde and Veit Valentin, the architect and city planner Werner Hegemann, me jurist Max Alsberg, the economist Alfons Golclschmidt, the mathematical statistician Emil J. Gumbel (he taught, until his death in 1966, at Columbia University in New York City), the philosopher Ludwig Marcuse (later at the University of California in Los Angeles), the musicologist Oskar Bie, and the international jurist Hans Wehberg (later at the Institut Universitaire des Hautes fitudes Internationales in Geneva). 1 There were, however, a few jacks-of-all-trades among these writers. Joachim Ringelnatz, originally a sailor, was also a painter and a cabaret singer and tried —according to nis own boastful admission—at least thirty other professions before he became a successful poet and writer. Axel Eggebrecht began his career as a clerk and a traveling salesman, but by 1925 he already had a good income as a radio and screen writer. Egon Erwin Kisch was a magician, choir singer, busboy, sailor, film extra in Algiers, etc., mostly in performance of his duty as rasender Reporter for a number of well-paying journals.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbiihne\n\n21\n\ndun.) Of course, some had opposed the war from the beginning; others turned against it because of their front experiences. Leonhard Frank, René Schickele, and Max Brod went to Switzerland early in the war and wrote pacifist articles. Rudolf Leonhard, who had volunteered in 1914, was later court-martialed for pacifist agitation. Ernst Toller, who received a medical discharge after two years of front-line service, was imprisoned in 1918 for incitement to revolution. Erich Muhsam, a revolutionary anarchist from the prewar days, declined to perform even labor service during the war and was put under surveillance. Although none of the \"old\" generation went into exile, almost all joined the antiwar organizations. This too demanded courage and brought about a good deal of police harassment and social ostracism. Clearly, little of what has been said until now explains why these writers were in opposition. They did not share in the miseries of the workers and salaried employees, nor in the fears and frustrations of the upper classes. They had, as it must seem, no personal grounds for opposing a state and a society that allowed them freedom of expression and economic comfort. Nor did they share in the general Weltschmerz or \"cultural despair\" of the conservative intellectuals. They were philosophical and social optimists whose hopes often survived the National Socialist oppression. Was their opposition then an act of will due to compassion and to premonition? This is undoubtedly true to some degree. They were genuine humanitarians, horrified by social injustice and the suffering of the poor; they were also prophets who foresaw the coming triumph of nihilism. But there were other considerations: their historical heritage as unattached, free German intellectuals, and the Jewish background of most of these writers. The role of the free writer in German society was never an easy one; the craft of writing was not respected unless the writer was a recognized scholar. Men of letters who hoped to gain a following for their ideas generally sought to do so within a university or learned society. This is borne out by a random listing of the outstanding intellectuals in nineteenth-century Germany who were, for the most part, academicians. Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling held university posts, as did a very large number of the German savants who came after them: Niebuhr, Ranke, Dahlmann, Treitschke, Harnack, Weber, and Meinecke, to name a few. The university professor commanded, and still does, a prestige very near the top of the country's social scale. Schopenhauer's unsuccessful attempt to become a lecturer at one of the great German universities made him bitter for the rest of his life. The professor, with his traditional role, his central place in the history of his country and\n\n22\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\nhis acknowledgment of authority, enjoyed almost a monopoly of respectability in the intellectual world. Even the radical poet Heine, with all his unruliness, sought a university post and went abroad when he failed tofinda niche for himself in the official life of Germany. This situation changed somewhat late in the nineteenth century, but even when successful the independent writer never gained that respect which the public reserved for academics.m More often than not he was regarded by the public with suspicion: he had no \"official\" identity; he moved outside of authority within an urbane and frivolous society, and he was arrogant enough to venture into political criticism. If his political views inclined to the Left, he was regarded as that obnoxious Literat whose disrespect for German traditions bordered on treason. Academicians knew well enough, especially after 1848, to leave politics to the politicians; Hermann Baumgarten, who taught at the technical academy of Karlsruhe in Baden and who played a part in the political life of that state, made this point very clear not only on behalf of himself and his fellow academicians, but all educated Germans: \"It is one of the most ruinous errors to believe that a good scholar, lawyer, merchant, or civil servant, who is interested in public affairs and reads the newspapers assiduously, is able to participate actually in political life.\"14 In Britain and in France, the man of letters had an honored place in society, and he often outshone the scholar. In Germany, a high-school teacher of pedestrian talent (actually there were many brilliant Germans who taught in the Gymnasiums) was apt to feel himself superior —because he was a respected servant of the state—to a celebrated journalist or writer. Heine, the successful Literat who left Germany at the age of thirty-four and never returned, was something of an enigma to his countrymen. To live such a scandalous existence as Heine did, to criticize harshly one's country, and to glorify the German language while consorting in Paris with French revolutionary rabble violated all the criteria for respectability. Although Heine had considered himself a German patriot, these circumstances complicated his relations with his fatherland: he had a French esprit which serious-minded Germans interpreted as a lack of depth or sincerity, and he was a Jew. Maxim Golo Mann, \"The Intellectuals,\" Encounter, June 1955, p. 43. Mann reports that a public-opinion poll conducted in Western Germany in 1954 on the prestige of professions in that country brought the unequivocal response that the university professor ranked above the parliamentarian, the industrialist, and the trade-union leader. No profession ranked above that of the academician. The writer was ranked far below the teacher in an elementary school.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbuhne\n\n23\n\nmilian Harden had similar difficulties; he began his career as a Prussian conservative but in the end, his rebelliousness and his Jewishness caused him to repudiate his conservative past and to be repudiated by German society in turn. There was still another aspect of the writing of the free publicist which the \"true\" German found irritating: its frequent Western orientation. A bitterness toward the West, its political institutions and modes of life had taken root in German thought after the Napoleonic invasion. The alleged materialism and rationalism of the West was considered a threat to all that was uniquely German. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, this reaction in Germany led in some intellectual quarters to an intense preoccupation with a \"Germanic\" ideology.11 The proponents of this ideology regarded Germany's historical destiny as a thing apart because, it was said, the German personality recoiled from the hollow values trumpeted by the West, values which would drag Germany down from her spiritual heights in the leveling process of democracy. Such philosophical patriotism was to be repudiated by the Weimar literary radical who sincerely believed, as did Heine, that Germany's greatest contributions could only be made within the mainstream of Western traditions. Because of the conflict between these two schools of thought, the so-called Westerner among German intellectuals easily passed for subversive. A very high percentage of the Weimar left-wing intellectuals combined all the characteristics repugnant to the Germanic ideologists: Francophile, Jewish, Western, rebellious, progressive, democratic, rationalist, socialist, liberal, and cosmopolitan. Heine's contrast of French and German patriotism was as much pertinent for the Weimar period as it was in his own day: The patriotism of the Frenchman consists in the fact that his heart is warmed by it . . . it expands and spreads. . . . The patriotism of the German . . . makes his heart narrower, so that it contracts like leather in the cold—he hates whatever is foreign, and does not wish to be a citizen of the world, or of Europe, but only a cabined and cribbed German. 16\n\nIt was because of their sense of isolation that the unattached German intellectuals, not only of the Left, but also of the Right, tended to show an intolerance, an extremism generally missing from their French, British, or American contemporaries. Zola could pride himself \"Fritz Stern, The Politics of Cultural Despair (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1961) , p. xiii, shows that the principal goals of Germanic ideology were \"the revival of a mythical Deutschtum and the creation of political institutions that would embody and preserve the peculiar character of the Germans.\"\n\n24\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nat the time of the Dreyfus affair for having shaken the French nation from the bottom; German writers never had such power. As a consequence, they wanted a fundamentally altered society that would listen to their exhortations. When accused of demagogy, they countered with heightened criticism. Their criticism became even more radical, or at least more conspicuous, if they suffered from the additional burden of being Jewish. This was true of most Weltbuhne collaborators. Of the sixty-eight writers whose religious origin could be established—and this, admittedly, was a difficult and delicate task—forty-two were found to be of Jewish descent, two were half-Jews and only twenty-four were non-Jews. Of the latter, three were married to Jewish women.0 The term \"Jewish origin\" is being used here in full consciousness of its ambiguities. The criterion for \"Jew\" and \"non-Jew\" used in this study actually bears some resemblance to the stipulations of the Nuremberg laws because \"Jewishness\" was generally defined in Germany in the spirit of these laws well before their enactment in 1935. Not only the Rightists, but many liberals and Jewish writers on Jewish accomplishments in Germany (such books were at that time very popular) diligently qualified anyone a Jew who had at least one Jewish parent. Even less did it occur to anyone to treat such converts as Karl Marx and the conservative theoretician Friedrich Julius Stahl, or the anti-Semitic Jew Walther Rathenau as non-Jews.\" This German usage must be accepted here if our examination is to make sense. For it must be borne in mind that \"Jewishness\" in Weimar Germany was a publicly imposed condition. A significant minority of those whom the German public considered Jews were not aware of their Jewishness or, rather, denied this awareness. Even smaller was the number of those who practiced the Jewish religion. Only a few of the Weltbuhne circle 0 It might be more than a coincidence that in the middle or \"war generation\" of the Weltbuhne the Jews outnumbered the non-Jews by more than two to one. In the two other generations the ratio was about one to one. It was around the tum of the century that Jews predominated in the German press. By the 1920's, the non-Jews were in a stronger position and by 1930 \"Aryanization\" was proceeding at a high speed in the big Berlin press, especially in the Jewish House of Ullstein and in the Christian Scherl (Hugenberg) concern. It might also be of interest to note that all foreign-born collaborators of the Weltbtihne (or at least those who are under consideration here) were of Jewish descent—a reflection on the great Western migration (or, re-migration) of the Jews in the twentieth century. p See, for instance, Rudolf Schay, Juden in der deutschen Politik (Berlin, 1929). The author, definitely philo-Semitic, devotes a separate chapter to each one of these political thinkers.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbuhne\n\n25\n\nopenly acknowledged that they were Jews and hardly anyone (Jew or non-Jew) was a believer. Yet, as the years passed, what had been avoided as a delicate question in liberal circles began to be openly discussed. And the references to Jewishness were all the more painful when they came from liberal friends. Alfred Kerr, the drama critic, wrote: Even people of sensitive nature could put up with such things as when, on the Day of Atonement, a boor would call a gentleman with a prayer book \"damned Jewish dung!\" Or when a major of the \"Eleventh\" [regiment] would publicly declare on the streetcar: \"There are so many pregnant Jewish women—makes you want to vomit!\" These things did not hurt. But when enlightened, well-meaning, and considerate friends said \"The Jewish gentlemen\"—that hurt.16\n\nJewishness indeed was determined not so much by one's enemies as by one's friends; and it was a source of humiliation, for—all the hypocritical assertions of the courts of the Weimar Republic to the contrary— \"Jew\" was a pejorative term. The Jewish writers of the Weltbuhne grew up, for the most part, in a bourgeois milieu where religion was seldom taken seriously, but where certain family practices and the circle of friends made Jewishness a foregone conclusion. The rebellion of these intellectuals against their bourgeois heritage included their rejection of the formal Judaism of their parents. It involved a tacit recognition that Judaism and unquestioning German patriotism were mutually exclusive propositions and that assimilation, heralded since the days of Moses Mendelssohn, had failed in the face of German middle- and upper-class opposition. Thus some converted to Lutheranism (if the conversion was only for the sake of convenience), others to Catholicism (if they had some interest in religion).\" The rest generally proclaimed themselves to be agnostics or atheists. In a way, these intellectuals proposed their complete assimilation, not into Germandom, but into a community of progressive Europeans. There was, however, no such community; therefore they felt themselves \"homeless.\" \"Homelessness\" might become an advantage if it allowed the individual the freedom of unemotional and uncommitted observation. But these intellectuals 9 Oskar Bie, the essayist Egon Friedell, and Kurt Tucholsky were Lutheran converts. The novelist Alfred Doblin renounced Judaism in 1917 and twenty-four years later converted to Catholicism. In his old age Doblin published several religious essays. (See the similar case of Franz Werfel, another Die Weltbuhne contributor.)\n\n26\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\nwere neither unemotional nor uncommitted; nor were they allowed to be impartial observers. On the contrary, they were urged to alternately identify themselves as Jews and as Germans—being alternately chided, when they tried, for clannishness or for \"infiltration.\" They were told that not even their style was their own but an expression of \"Jewish agony.\" A moderation of zeal brought accusations of subterfuge; a heightening of zeal was damned as Jewish arrogance. Consequently, the Jewish intellectuals labored under the impression that their ideologies were less a product of intellectual conviction than of an imposed alienation, that anything they said or wrote would be interpreted as abject self-justification. In the words of Jakob Wassermann, himself an occasional contributor to the Weltbuhne: Vain to adjure the nation of poets and thinkers in the name of its poets and thinkers. Every prejudice one thinks disposed of breeds a thousand others, as carrion breeds maggots.—Vain to present the right cheek after the left has been struck. It does not move them to the slightest thoughtfulness; it neither touches nor disarms them; they strike the right cheek too. They say: He dares to open his mouth? Gag him!—Vain to act in exemplary fashion. They say: We know nothing, we have seen nothing, we have heard nothing.—Vain to seek obscurity. They say: The coward! He is creeping into hiding, driven by his evil conscience.—Vain to go among them and offer them one's hand. They say: Why does he take such liberties, with his Jewish obtrusiveness?—Vain to keep faith with them, as a comrade-in-arms or a fellow citizen. They say: He is Proteus, he can assume any shape or form.—Vain to help them strip off the chains of slavery. They say: No doubt he found it profitable.—Vain to counteract the poison. They brew fresh venom.—Vain to live for them and die for them. They say: He is a Jew.17 There is no attempt here to imply that this too was the attitude of the non-Jewish writers of the Weltbuhne: there is no trace of antiSemitism among them and they risked their lives in defense of the Jewish community. Yet, even they expected from their Jewish colleagues in the Weltbuhne that they show solidarity with their harassed and ridiculed former coreligionaries. This, of course, contradicted a very basic belief of the left-wing intellectuals: that they should not be looked upon as Jews, but as Europeans. From all this the Jewish left-wing intellectual could deduce only one thing: that his Jewishness enslaved him. \"The Jews are proletarians,\" wrote Arnold Zweig in 1933.18 \"They are proletarians, despite their luxury, their ten-room apartments, their university education, and their intellectual professions. The essence of proletarian existence\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbuhne\n\n27\n\nis also symptomatic of their lives: they have no way of securing their present or their future, because they possess neither political guarantees, the right to participate in political decisions, nor do they possess the instruments of production.\" The Jew in Germany, Zweig argued, was a proletarian even at a time when he was granted a privileged position. These privileges were always revokable. Consequently, there were only two sorts of Jews in Germany: those who persisted in their dream of equality and assimilation, and those who, recognizing their true condition, joined the working-class movement or at least aligned themselves with the proletariat. There is no reason for disagreement with Zweig's argument to this extent: the Jew in Germany always bore a stigma. And the only way to rid himself of it was to conclude a \"silent contract,\" in Zweig's words, with that group—the workers—which had no interest in being antiSemitic. Many Jews took this step, from the founders of the socialist movement to such twentieth-century figures as Rosa Luxemburg, Paul Levi, or Hugo Haase; the Jews in the Weltbuhne were proud to be their followers, short of an unconditional submission to either of the two parties which claimed these socialist leaders. The enthusiasm of the Weltbuhne writers for revolutionary socialist propositions was to a great part due to the recognition of their inescapable Jewish condition. With this recognition came a growing pride in particular Jewish accomplishments. Or, if it did not come, there was always the consolation of that \"characteristic Jewish humor\": \"A Jew has said once\"— wrote Kurt Tucholsky—\" 'I am proud to be a Jew. Were I not proud, I would still be a Jew—then I might as well be proud!' \" 1 9 In the years after the National Socialist assumption of power, German exile literature gradually abandoned what had initially been one of its favorite occupations: the documenting of Jewish accomplishments in science and culture. In the growing Popular Front atmosphere where Communist and anti-Communist emigres referred to each other as \"antifascist patriots,\" specific Jewish contributions to German life were passed over in silence to make common cause with the non-Jewish political emigres. It was considered indelicate, and even suspicious, to mention that most of those \"other Germans\" who had represented German democratic culture, were in fact Jews. Indeed not the émigrés, but the National Socialists (and a few Jewish nationalist organizations) were the Jewish intellectuals' best propagandists with their many accounts of Jewish accomplishments in pre-1933 Germany. Inaccurate as these accounts were, they generously granted the title of\n\n28\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing\n\nIntellectuals\n\n\" J e w \" to many outstanding non-Jews.' On the other hand, Western liberal historians generally underplay the cultural significance of the German Jews while the Communist historians do not mention it at all. Yet there is no reason why it should not be acknowledged that, in twentieth-century Germany where the Jews formed less than one percent of the nation's population, 20 Jews were responsible for a great part of German culture. The owners of three of Germany's greatest newspaper publishing houses; the editors of the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt; most book publishers; the owners and editors of the Neue Rundschau and other distinguished literary magazines; the owners of Germany's greatest art galleries were all Jews. Jews played a major part in theater and in the film industry as producers, directors, and actors. Many of Germany's best composers, musicians, artists, sculptors, and architects were Jews. Their participation in literary criticism and in literature was enormous: practically all the great critics and many novelists, poets, dramatists, essayists of Weimar Germany were Jews. A recent American study has shown that thirtyone of the sixty-five leading German \"expressionists\" and \"neo-objectivists\"' were Jews. 2 1 It is well known what fatal damage the emigration of Jewish physicists and other scientists caused to Germany after 1933. If cultural contributions by Jews were far out of proportion to their numerical strength, their participation in left-wing intellectual activities was even more disproportionate. Apart from orthodox Communist literature where there were a majority of non-Jews, Jews were responsible for a great part of leftist literature in Germany. Die Weltbühne was in this respect not unique; Jews published, edited, and to a great part wrote the other left-wing intellectual magazines. Jews played a decisive role in the pacifist and feminist movements, and in the campaigns for sexual enlightenment. * See, for instance, such standard anti-Semitic diatribes as Theodor Fritsch, Handbuch der Judenfrage ( L e i p z i g , 1 9 3 7 ) or Adolf Bartels, Jüdische Herkunft und Literaturwissenschaft ( L e i p z i g , 1 9 2 6 ) . Not only do these \" m a n u a l s \" list the names of thousands of eminent Jewish Germans, but they qualify as Jews such people as Karl Liebknecht (whose mother was J e w i s h ) , the Mann brothers ( w h o h a d Jewish wives), Willi Münzenberg, Bertolt Brecht, and the Weltbühne writers Leonhard Frank, Annette Kolb, and Friedrich Wolf, none of whom was Jewish. T h e same excess of zeal characterizes some Jewish publications as, for instance, S. Winniger, ed., Grosse jüdische Nationalbiographie ( 1 9 2 5 - 1 9 3 6 ) . For a rectification of these common errors, see Siegmund Kaznelson, ed., Juden im deutschen Kulturbereich (Berlin, 1 9 6 2 ) , 1 0 4 3 f f . ' \"Neo-objectivism\" or Neue Sachlichkeit was a major literary movement in the second half of the 1920's in Germany.\n\nThe Writers of the Weltbuhne\n\n29\n\nThe left-wing intellectuals did not simply \"happen to be mostly Jews\" as some pious historiography would have us believe,22 but Jews created the left-wing intellectual movement in Germany. The extraordinary Jewish participation in German culture is to be explained by the peculiarities of the Central European Jewish intellectual tradition and by the Jews' historic exclusion from the more \"respectable\" professions as the civil service, the army, the judiciary, or university teaching. The even higher Jewish participation in leftist culture, however, is due to a specific development: their recognition of the fact that business, artistic, or scientific careers do not help solve the Jewish problem, and that Weimar Germany had to undergo dire transformation if German anti-Semitism was to end. In summary, the \"typical\" Weltbuhne writer in the Weimar era— with due respect to significant exceptions—was born into the \"war generation\"; he was the son of bourgeois parents; he belonged to the educational elite, and he was more likely to be of Jewish than of non-Jewish origin. As a Jew, as a man of the Left and as an intellectual, he undoubtedly belonged to a very small minority of Germans. Hence the frequent reference by historians to the \"small group\" around the WeltbuhneBut the group was not small, nor was the Weltbuhne archetype as isolated from the mainstream of German life as he felt he was, or as he is often depicted as being. For one thing, he was obviously at home in Berlin. For another, as a member of the \"war generation,\" he—as many other German intellectuals—had gnawing doubts about the purpose and justification of Imperial Germany, of German society, and of his own life. As a patriot in 1914 and as a soldier in the war, he experienced the same exaltations and the same disillusionments as did the other Germans. As a revolutionary in 1918 he voiced the hopes of millions of Germans. Finally, as a disaffected German in the Weimar era, he showed the discontent of most of his compatriots. These experiences, particularly the militant role he played, made him a part of German history. * For instance, Koppel S. Pinson writes in his Modern Germany (New York, 1954), 459: \"A small group of pacifist, antimilitarist, and antinationalist humanitarians gathered around the Weltbuhne, edited by Carl von Ossietzky, were dedicated to the cause of deflating the pompous façade of the still flourishing Prussianism and of exposing the secret machinations of the old order of officers and Reichswehr.\"\n\nChapter II\n\nDIE WELTBUHNE AND ITS EDITORS SIEGFRIED JACOBSOHN\n\nWhen Prussian police and the SA seized the editorial offices of the Weltbiihne on March 7, 1933, and forbade further publication, the journal was precisely twenty-seven and a half years old.1 The first issue of the Schaubuhne appeared on September 7, 1905, in Berlin, and immediately created a stir through the quality of its contents. In it appeared a scene from Hugo von Hofmannsthal's until then unpublished Odipus und die Sphinx; a remarkable essay on Maximilian Harden, and a spirited jibe at contemporary German drama by Julius Bab, a young critic, who spared only Frank Wedekind and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The Berlin theater, into which Die Schaubuhne entered with such lusty energy, was a battlefield where naturalists, realists, symbolists, neoromantics, and the advocates of Sttldrama * relentlessly slaughtered each other. Through the audacity and talent of its editor, Die Schaubuhne soon rose to the front rank among the theatrical journals. When he founded the journal, Siegfried Jacobsohn2 was only twenty-four years old but already an authority in a field dominated by such devastating critics as Alfred Kerr, Fritz Mauthner, Arthur Eloesser, and Oscar Blumenthal (one of Jacobsohn's relatives). Jacobsohn's family history reflected the profound effect of nineteenth-century legal emancipation on German Jews—indeed it is an example of the radical transformation achieved within three generations. Jacobsohn's grandfather was devout and orthodox; he spoke Yiddish. Jacobsohn's father, * Writers who insisted on the primacy of form and rejected both the rigidity and drabness of naturalism and the unbridled emotionalism of neoromantic theater.\n\n30\n\nDie Weltbühne and Its Editors\n\n31\n\na wholesale merchant in Berlin, was a liberal in politics and religion who gave the son a Teutonic name and a good secular education. The son turned against his father when he was sixteen. He quit the Gymnasium to become a Theatromane (a \"theater maniac\"), and a professional critic.3 In 1901, a Hamburg newspaper printed his first theater critique and in the same year he was given charge of the drama section of the Welt am Montag, a Berlin newspaper. Three years later Jacobsohn published a learned study of the Berlin theater which he liked to call his \"unrequested doctoral dissertation.\"4 The book brought him fame as well as serious trouble. On November 12, 1904, the Berliner Tageblatt accused him of plagiarism for having borrowed a few lines from someone else's critique. It needed the cultural ferment of Berlin for the mushrooming of such a petty crime into a major affaire. Almost all Berlin newspapers gave it prominent coverage and well-known writers (Maximilian Harden, Arthur Schnitzler, and others) as well as psychologists (C. G. Jung!) came out in Jacobsohn's defense. He himself wrote a book on the subject.\" The fact that twenty years later Bertolt Brecht could borrow with casual elegance, and with relative impunity, reflects, if not the extent of the moral revolution that had meanwhile taken place, then at least the wide conquests made by the concept of artistic freedom. Jacobsohn had less luck. He lost his position at the Welt am, Montag and decided to found his own theatrical journal. Die Schaubühne, after some initial difficulties with financial backers, soon became a successful enterprise.\" When Jacobsohn left the Gymnasium, the idea of becoming a critic was for him not so much a profession as an exalted avocation. The b S. J. [Siegfried Jacobsohn], Der Fall Jacobsohn (Charlottenburg, 1913). Jacobsohn argued that the plagiarism had not been a conscious act of pirating but was due to his extraordinary memory which retained—often word for word— everything of value that he read. c During the first few years of its existence Die Schaubühne was published by various businessmen but in October 1912, Jacobsohn set up his own publishing house, the Verlag der Schaubühne. Besides printing the journal, the Verlag also published about half a dozen books, mostly collections of articles which had appeared in the journal. The latter experiment was unsuccessful and cost Jacobsohn a good deal of money. Following Jacobsohn's death, his successors abandoned the book-publishing business. Jacobsohn was anything but a financial wizard and he barely eked out a living from his very successful journal. (See, for instance, Tucholsky's letter to Fräulein Hünicke, administrative secretary of the Weltbühne, June 19, 1925, Kurt Tucholsky, Ausgewählte Briefe, 106 ff.) Jacobsohn's wife, Edith, a translator, also engaged in the publishing business as owner of \"Williams and Co.\" This too was a financial debacle, but then Mrs. Jacobsohn, who was related to Eugen Schiffer, vice-chancellor of the Weimar Republic from 1919 to 1921, was independently wealthy. (See Kurt Hiller, \"Aufstieg, Glanz und Verfall der Weltbühne,\" Konkret, June 1962.)\n\n32\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nBerlin theater critic at the turn of the century was not simply a frustrated playwright and professional grumbler; he was a priest assisting the dramatist and the theater director in the performance of a sacred function. That function was to inculcate culture and progress in the heart of the Wilhelmian Bürger. Through the ruthless presentation on the stage of \"truth, nothing but the truth,\"—the creed of the \"naturalists\"—the Bürger, by definition servile, materialistic, pompous, bigoted, and conventional, was to be persuaded to become a modern and, therefore, better man. He was to stop prostrating himself before the higher orders and through a moral and aesthetic regeneration become a self-respecting bourgeois.\" Clearly, this metamorphosis could not be accomplished through the medium of the officially sponsored theaters of the \"Hoftheater\" variety, nor through the other established theaters whose directors rejected \"naturalism\" as an unaesthetic aberration. New society had to be molded by new, free theaters. This, at least, was the concept behind the \"Freie Bühne,\" a club founded in 1889 at the instigation of Maximilian Harden. The leader of the Freie Bühne, which issued its own journal, called Freie Bühne, and organized theatrical presentations, was Otto Brahm, who in the \"Deutsches Theater\" introduced Hauptmann, Shaw, Strindberg, Ibsen, and Wilde to the Berlin audience. The crucial piece in Brahm's repertory was Gerhart Hauptmann's \"Weavers,\" a drama shocking in its stark naturalism and in its social-revolutionary implications. As a theatrical trend, \"naturalism\" was in vogue for only a few years; by the time Die Schaubühne was founded, it was already outmoded. But many succeeding movements—and succession occurred at an amazing pace—were also understood to perform a revolutionary function. Missionary theater did produce some masterpieces, but the intellectuals' attempt to lead the Bürgertum through the medium of the stage proved a failure. It gradually dawned on the Freie Bühne circle that its influence was limited to the hours the audience spent in the theater, and it was particularly disheartening that not only the Bürger but the working class itself proved to be immune to the call for an ethico-aesthetic upheaval. One year after the founding of the Freie Bühne club, Bruno Wille founded the \"Freie Volksbühne,\" an association expressly designed to attract the masses. \"Art shall belong to the people and not a The German word Bürger is not equivalent to the French bourgeois, at least not in the modern German usage of these words, for the first has a feudal connotation and denotes an estate (Bürgerstand) to which one belongs by birth or by one's profession, the second has a French revolutionary and Marxist meaning and denotes membership in the capitalist or entrepreneurial class.\n\nDie Weltbühne and Its Editors\n\n33\n\nbe the privilege of one class,\" Wille announced in his first speech to the members of his association. The new experiment was not without promise, for many workers trained and educated by Social Democracy were ready for the theater. But as it turned out rapidly, it was education through the classics they were interested in and not the revolutionizing of their consciences. According to Erwin Piscator, the great Communist theater director of the 1920s, the workers at the turn of the century were not ready for the political theater.5 For them, the theater remained a Feiertagskunst, a holiday affair, for which they wore their Sunday best and were shocked to discover their week-day worst paraded on stage. It was not until the Freie Volksbühne was taken over by the trade unions that it became a powerful instrument of popular education. By then the Freie Volksbühne's original revolutionary purpose was forgotten. Whether Piscator was right in asserting that \"naturalism\" and the Freie Volksbühne, being typically bürgerlich, were bound to remain ineffective because of their indirect appeal 8 is too complicated a question to examine here. (Piscator s own grandiose experiment with political theater in the 1920's, although very \"in\" among snobs, did not have a demonstrably greater impact upon the proletariat.) The fact remains that in the first decade of the twentieth century both social drama and socially conscious directors tended to disappear from the great Berlin stage. Social rebelliousness fled to the small theaters of the new expressionist literature. The great theater gradually succumbed to the genius of Max Reinhardt, whose scenes combined the festive with the fantastic, the spiritual with the sensual. The founders of the Freie Bühne either retired, as did Otto Brahm, or turned to politics, especially to political journalism (Theodor Wolff, one of the founders of the Freie Bühne, became a crusader of political democracy as editor of the Berliner Tageblatt). More and more the former drama critic waxed political, enlarging his sphere of influence through a combination as yet unheard of: culture and politics. The changing names of the intellectual journals reflected this new direction. Thus the Freie Bühne, the journal of Brahm's club, changed its name with successive shifts in editorial emphasis: it became the Freie Bühne für modernes Leben (Free Stage for Modern Living), then the Freie Bühne für den Entioicklungskampf der Zeit (Free Stage for the Evolutionary Struggle for Our Time), and, finally, in 1904, it became the all-encompassing Die Neue Rundschau. Die Schaubühne was relatively slow in going over to politics. As Enseling points out, Jacobsohn, who was a member of the Freie Bühne club, insisted with a perseverance bounding on \"monomania,\"7 that\n\n34\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\nthe theater alone was called upon to regenerate society. The primary preoccupation of the journal remained the theater almost until World War I, yet Die Schaubühne was by no means the most progressive review of its kind. Because it refused to accept much of the real avant-garde literature, it was ultimately less successful than such small magazines as Der Sturm, Die Aktion, or Pan in exploiting new ideas or in appreciating the revolutionary significance of the newest literary trend, expressionism.* When the journal began to make the shift from theater to politics, it was not Siegfried Jacobsohn but some of his collaborators—especially young Kurt Tucholsky—who provided the impetus. And it was Tucholsky's phrase, coined in April 1914, \"We dislike our radicals precisely because they aren't radical\" 8 that might have served henceforth as the motto of the journal. With its commitment to political agitation, Die Schaubühne now energetically sought the commitment of others. \"We have a hundred dogmas on meditation but hardly one on action,\" complained Tucholsky.9 Taking up Heinrich Mann's demand for the bridging of Macht and Geist, of political and intellectual power, he let loose his agile aliases Peter Panter, Theobald Tiger, and Ignaz Wrobel (his fourth alter ego, Kaspar Hauser, made his début only after World War I ) against the German Bürger. Tucholsky and Die Schaubühne were at the beginning of their political campaign when they were interrupted by World War I. Because they had not yet set themselves a definite political course, most writers of the Schaubühne threw themselves into the August war enthusiasm. Julius Bab proclaimed that he himself would \"stand or fall with Germany.\" The Viennese essayist Egon Friedell, an habitué of the Café Central, who had mocked patriots, politicians, journalists, Zionists, Jewish assimilationists, left-wing and right-wing radicals, and all other conceivable ideas and organizations,10 asserted that it was Germany's task to colonize France culturally \"so as to raise those crude Celtic tribes [the French] at least half-way to the level of Central European civilization.\"11 He declared in the same article that the English were a \"nation of dumb criminals\" and that Prussian militarism was equivalent to \"self-sacrifice, dutifulness, fear of God, humanitarianism, knowledge, and progress.\"12 It is enough to know to what paroxysms of exaltation avant-garde writers rose in those days to • Julius Bab pointed to fundamental shortcoming of \"expressionism\" when he questioned in the Schaubühne the feasibility of a fusion between \"brotherly love and aristocratic seclusion.\" See Alf Enseling, Die Weltbühne (Münster, Westf., 1962), 48.\n\nDie Weltbiihne and Its Editors\n\n35\n\nbe quite confident that Friedell meant what he said and that he, like so many of his Jewish fellow intellectuals, was now certain to find a warm place in the bosom of the fatherland. Jacobsohn was sober enough to protest against the gushy patriotic plays and operettas that had invaded the German stage and to ask for serious drama in serious days but, in the first years of the war, Die Schaubuhne had no radical message. Political commentaries were written by Robert Breuer (he signed his name as Germanicus), an experienced socialist politician, who followed the patriotic line of the Majority Socialists.* In 1917, a literary revolution transformed Die Schaubuhne. Now, as prowar idealism gave way to antiwar idealism, the writers of the journal began to talk of the \"triumph of morality over narrow nationalism.\" They no longer spoke of Germany but of humanity, and shortly before the end of the war, Alfred Polgar called the war \"God's great antagonist.\"13 In April 1918, Jacobsohn changed the journal's name to Die Weltbiihne. The following years brought contributions by Germany's best leftist writers and sensational revelations in the journal about the \"Black Reichswehr,\" illegal rearmament, and the antirepublican judiciary. The political image of the Weltbiihne for all later years was molded by Jacobsohn who now found in politics his true vocation. He was a man in whom everything exuded passion: he was enthusiastic, fanatical, obstinate, often ruthless, and unduly suspicious. \"This man was full of extremes of emotion,\" wrote a Danish friend14 after Jacobsohn's death, \"yet his extremism was genuine. Genuineness attracts and repels at the same time. So does Die Weltbiihne . . . because it is Siegfried Jacobsohn's soul and his truth.\" Many of Jacobsohn's writers developed a deep affection for him. \"There was abundant goodness and sensitiveness in this man; much leniency and understanding,\" wrote Walther Victor.15 Enseling writes of Jacobsohn's \"Old Testament fanaticism,\"18 of his obstinate search for truth relieved by an occasional lightheartedness. Jacobsohn was an unyielding pedant with regard to linguistic purity but he did not refrain from colorful Yiddish or Berlin jargon. He was a dictator of style: \"His almost automatic stylistic mechanism permitted no wild innovations,\" wrote Tucholsky,17 \"no violent punctuation signs, no dash fallowing a period (a mortal sin) . . . he was always on the alert. And so our contributions were really letters addressed to him; written for him, f In a postwar apology Jacobsohn explained to Kurt Hiller how he had been presented, in 1914, with a choice between military service or lending the pages of his journal to war propaganda. He chose the latter. See Hiller, \"Aufstieg, Glanz und Verfall der Weltbiihne,\" Konkret, March 1962, p. 7.\n\nWeimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals\n\n36\n\nwith our mind on him. We hoped to meet with his approval, his agreement—his pleasure.\" Jacobsohn was a model editor because he allowed his collaborators a maximum in thematical freedom and a minimum in stylistic extravagance, but his passionate nature helped to give the journal the epithet \"hysterical.\" He transplanted into the political Weltbiihne the petty professional squabbles of a theatrical magazine. He hated with a passion Alfred Kerr, Maximilian Harden, and Karl Kraus. Stefan Grossmann, his competitor from the Tage-Buch and Montag Morgen, he accused—not quite unjustly—of having taken bribes from a dramatist and of being a plagiarist.18 The result of all this was a good number of libel suits. In the spring of one year alone (1925), Jacobsohn fought simultaneous legal battles with the radical socialist writer Wilhelm Herzog (whom he had accused of having pocketed the money of the workers), Gustav Stresemann (whom Jacobsohn had accused of currency manipulations), the German Nationalists (because the Weltbiihne had asserted that the international smuggler Honnef was a prime force in that party), and, of course, Stefan Grossmann. Jacobsohn seems to have been in the wrong in most of these cases.19 These disputes were characterized by great vulgarity in which \"dung\" was a common epithet. When Tucholsky and, later, Ossietzky assumed leadership of the Weltbiihne, personal attacks on fellow left-wing intellectuals disappeared from the journal. But as long as Jacobsohn was its editor, Arnold Zweig's generalized judgment applied to the Weltbiihne: \"They were Heine's successors . . . these founders and publishers of the small, courageous weeklies, who hated each other as Heine hated Borne, as the several schools of Greek Sophists or the French philosophes of the eighteenth century hated each other.\"20 On December 3, 1926, Jacobsohn suddenly died in an epileptic fit. A few months earlier he had won Ossietzky over to the Weltbiihne. Now it was agreed that Tucholsky should become editor with Ossietzky as his deputy. At this time Tucholsky was living in voluntary exile in France; he now reluctantly agreed to return.21 KURT TUCHOLSKY\n\nKurt Tucholsky was born in 1890 in Berlin.22 Like Jacobsohn, he was a member of the \"war generation,\" and he too was the son of a prosperous and assimilated Jewish merchant. But there was nothing rebellious, passionate, or dedicated in the young Tucholsky. His father, to whom he was devoted, was sensitive, warm-hearted, melancholy, with\n\nDie Weltbühne and Its Editors\n\n37\n\na considerable gift for music; his mother, whom he apparently loathed, was cold, calculating, and something of a tyrant.* After the death of his father in 1905, Tucholsky left home, but he never broke away from his family and remained profoundly attached to his brother and sister. He attended the French Gymnasium in Berlin, founded in the seventeenth century for Huguenot émigrés, which was considered liberal and progressive and attracted the richest offsprings of the old and the new aristocracy. At his best Tucholsky was an indifferent, at his worst a failing student. Writing many years later, he attributed his low marks to the shortcomings of his teachers: Our school wasn't so nationalistically stirred up as today's. Our teachers weren't any more unintelligent, lazy, industrious, or smarter than other teachers. . . . And what did we learn? German: A ridiculous dismembering of the classics; fatuous essays, sloppily and injudiciously corrected; Middle High German poetry was learned by heart; no one had an inkling of its beauty. History: A senseless, incoherent complication of dynastic dates. We never had history instruction. Geography: Tributaries. Government districts. Names of cities. I don't think back to my schooling with hatred—it has become a matter of complete indifference to me. We never had any tragedies in school, nor terrible grievances. Bad teaching is what we did have.23\n\nIndifferent or not, Tucholsky did not forego those diplomas which would qualify him for privileged treatment in the army and for admission to a university. He completed his studies, after much coaxing by hired tutors, at a less fashionable Gymnasium. He then registered at the faculty of law of the University of Jena but again he made a poor student; his doctoral dissertation was at first rejected. Again he appealed to the assistance of tutors and in 1915 finally became \"Herr Doktor.\" By then, he was a celebrated writer; he also had a private income. In the same year, he was drafted into the army. As manager of a barbed-wire depot at a quiet sector of the Eastern Front, as a librarian at a school for aviators, and, finally, as a police commissioner in occupied Rumania, he never fired a weapon nor was ever in serious danger. Later he claimed that his war experience had taught him to hate the war and the military.
