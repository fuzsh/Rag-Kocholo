The critique of language marks the point of significant convergence: Brentano’s emphasis of reism and nominalism goes together with (1) his descriptive-semasiologic critique of language as a logical doctrine of the categories, and (2) his critique of language as a genetic semasiology, both bound by the view of the intentional nature of language. It is pointed out at lenghts that and how the component of genetic semasiology in Brentano allows comparison with the communicative, pragmatic and performative perspective of Mauthner’s Sprachkritik due to a shared emphasis on the rhetorical force of language.”\n\n———. “Nominalismo E Critica Delle Idee in Brentano.” Idee (1990): 217-235.\n\n———. “Brentano, Twardowski, and Polish Scientific Philosophy.” In Polish Scientific Philosophy.

Husserl’s version of descriptive psychology, a pure phenomenological psychology, according to its author tries to overcome Brentano’s (naturalistic) description of internal experience by explicitly considering the intentional content of mental events, and the different categories of objects as objects of a possible consciousness. Husserl’s investigations on internal time are an example of a quite specific sort of genetic inquiry, complementary to the descriptive one. Meinong, when discussing the relation of representation and perception of time, differentiates between the time as given in a representation (act time), in different sorts of (Meinongian) objects (object time), and in contents (content time). These questions of a Brentanist temporality problem are reconsidered and brought to a Husserlian conclusion.”\n\nAlbertazzi Liliana, and Poli Roberto, eds. Brentano in Italia.

Both schools of thought share, in fact, the same cultural background and their same initial stimulus in the thought of Franz Brentano. And one outcome of the subsequent rift between them was the oblivion into which the figure and thought of Brentano have fallen.\n\nThe first step to take in remedying this split is to return to Brentano and to reconstruct the ‘map’ of Brentanism.\n\nThe second task (which has been addressed by this book) is to revive interest in the theoretical complexity of Brentano’s thought and of his pupils and to revitalize those aspects that have been neglected by subsequent debate within the various movements of Brentanian inspiration.\n\nWe have accordingly decided to organize the book into two introductory essays followed by two sections (Parts 1 and 2) which systematically examine Brentano’s thought and that of his followers. The two introductory essays reconstruct the reasons for the ‘invisibility’, so to speak, of Brentano and set out the essential features of his philosophical doctrine. Part 1 of the book then examines six of Brentano’s most outstanding pupils (Marty, Stumpf, Meinong, Ehrenfels, Husserl and Twardowski). Part 2 contains nine essays concentrating on the principal topics addressed by the Brentanians.\n\nIn order to facilitate cross-referencing between the various essays contained in the book, each chapter concludes with a table giving the other points in the book where the same topics are dealt with.” (Foreword by the Editors).\n\nAlbertazzi Liliana.

Brentano’s metaphysics is not speculative; it is instead a programme for scientific research. 2. Some components of his metaphysics, especially those relating to the problem of perceptive continua — and many aspects of it developed experimentally by his pupils — are today discussed not only by philosophy but also by the cognitive sciences, more or less accurately, more or less consciously. 3. Some areas of the cognitive sciences express the need for a scientifically — even neurophysiologically — founded theory of intentionality.”\n\n———. “The Psychophysics of the Soul.

Disregarding Brentano’s distinctive psychological method, analytic philosophers have typically read him as a philosopher of mind, and his intentionality thesis as a contribution to the Cartesian project of clarifying the distinction between the mental and the physical. Phenomenologists, while more attentive to his method, tended to read Brentano as merely “on the way” to a truly phenomenological approach. I offer a third reading of Brentano thesis, one that attends to both the motivating concerns and the distinctive methodological features of his psychological project.”\n\n———. “Reading Brentano on the Intentionality of Ther Mental.” In Intentionality.

Aldershot: Ashgate, 2001.\n\n“Franz Brentano’s interpretation of Aristotle’s philosophy has attracted the attention of scholars right up to the present day. It has been considered important above all for two reasons: a) because it constituted the origin of the famous theory of intentionality, which was found in his book on Aristotle’s Psychology (1867); and b) because of the influence that the theory of the several senses of being, developed in his Dissertation of 1862, exercised on the birth of Heidegger’s thought. However, Brentano’s attempt to attribute to Aristotle the concept of creation and the theory of the immortality of the human soul has been almost completely rejected.\n\nThe first point was illustrated particularly by R. George and R. Sorabji, (1) but Brentano’s interpretation of Aristotelian psychology was also at the centre of the debate on the “Mind-Body Problem”, which involved several important philosophers, such as H. Putnam, the same R. Sorabji, M. Burnyeat, M. C. Nussbaum and others. (2) A part of his book on Aristotle’s Psychology was included in the recent collection of Essays on Aristotle’s “De anima”.(3) The second point, to which Heidegger himself drew attention in his famous letter to Father Richardson, (4) was studied first by F. Volpi and afterwards by many others, including myself. (5)\n\nThe interpretation of Aristotle’s theology expounded by Brentano in an additional essay to Aristotle’s Psychology, was criticised by Eduard Zeller in the third edition of his monumental history of Greek philosophy (1878). This criticism induced Brentano to write an essay on Aristotle’s Creationism (1882), followed by a reply from Zeller, a new intervention on the part of Brentano and a further reply by Zeller (1883), which seemed to close the discussion.(6) But Brentano reprinted his essay of 1882, with some additions, in the volume Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung der menschlichen Geistes (1911) (7) and in the same year he also published a monograph, Aristoteles and seine Weltanschauung, where he repeated the main lines of his interpretation. (8) The controversy was definitively resolved, in my opinion, only with W. D. Ross’s introduction to his edition of Aristotle’s Metaphysics, where the famous English Aristotelian refuted any possibility of conceiving Aristotle’s God as a creator, explicitly attacking the interpretation proposed by Brentano.(9)\n\nOn this occasion I do not wish to return to the theory of intentionality, even if I will make some reference to it. I would like, on the contrary, to see what consequences the interpretation of Aristotle’s ontology, developed by Brentano in his dissertation of 1862, and his interpretation of Aristotle’s theology, developed in his later writings, had for the modern and contemporary image of Aristotle; that is, how Brentano’s Aristotle influenced contemporary philosophers’ judgements of Aristotle’s metaphysics.” pp. 135-137\n\n(1) Cf.

Taking as his ontological data certain intentional phenomena that are apprehended with certainty, he conceives the substance-accident relation as a define-able type of part-whole relation which we can apprehend in “inner perception”. He is then able to distinguish the following types of individual or ens reale: substances; primary individuals which are not substances; accidents; aggregates; and boundaries.”\n\n———. “Brentano’s Analysis of the Consciousness of Time.” In Midwest Studies in Philosophy.

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1981.\n\n“Franz Brentano’s conception of philosophical analysis is illustrated by his aanalysis of our consciousness of time. The analysandum is not a linguistic expression or a concept; it is an experience of a certain sort. Hence the analysis might be called “phenomenological,” but Brentano prefers to say it is a matter of “descriptive psychology.”\n\nAn analysis of our consciousness of time is not, or course, an analysis of time. Hence Brentano’s analysis is consistent with a number of different conceptions of time. But it does presuppose that tense is to be taken seriously. In other words, Brentano does not accept the philosophical view, advocated by many contemporary philosophers of science, according to which distinctions of tense are merely “subjective” or otherwise “illusory.” Nor does he believe that all truths can he expressed in untensed sentences.\n\nI shall begin by formulating what Brentano takes to be a fundamental problem of descriptive psychology — that of accurately describing our awareness of temporal succession. Then I shall set forth the development of his views with respect to this problem.”\n\n———. Brentano and Meinong Studies. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1982.\n\nContents: Foreword 1; 1.

Some of the papers are expositions and commentaries. Others are developments of certain suggestions first made by Brentano or by Meinong.\n\nThe first two papers are concerned with the basic presuppositions of Brentano’s theoretical philosophy. “Brentano’s Theory of Substance and Accident” was presented to the Congress on the Philosophy of Franz Brentano held in Graz in September 1977; it first appeared in the Grazer Philosophische Studien, Vol. V (1978). The second paper – “Brentano’s Theory of Judgment” – has not been published before; but a preliminary version of part of it, entitled “Brentano’s Nonpropositional Theory of Judgment,” appeared in the Midwest Studies in Philosophy, Vol. I (1976). It should be noted that Brentano’s Kategorienlehre, to which many references are made in these two papers, has now been translated into English as The Theory of Categories, The Hague; Martinus Nijhoff 1981.\n\n(…)\n\nThe four papers that follow are concerned with the theory of value, as it had been conceived by Brentano and developed by Meinong. “Correct and Incorrect Emotion” and “The Quality of Pleasure and Displeasure” are both adapted from “Brentano’s Theory of Correct and Incorrect Emotion,” which first appeared in the Brentano issue of the Revue Internationale de Philosophie, Vol. 20 (1966).\n\n(…)\n\nThe final paper – “Beginnings and Endings” – is a revision of a paper entitled “Brentano als analytischer Metaphysiker,” which first appeared in the special volume of Conceptus entitled Österreichische Philosophie und ihr Einfluss auf die analytische Philosophie der Gegenwart, Jg. XI (1977), Nr. 28-30, pp. 77-82. A later version appeared in Time and Cause, edited by Peter Van Inwagen (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1980), pp. 17-25. It has been revised once again for the present volume.\n\nI hope that these essays will be thought of as carrying out the tradition of the Brentano school.” (From the Foreword)\n\n———.

It is the fact that intentional phenomena have logical or structural features that are not shared by what is not psychological.\n\nIt was typical of British empiricism, particularly that of Hume, to suppose that consciousness is essentially sensible. The objects of consciousness were thought to be primarily such objects as sensations and their imagined or dreamed counterparts. In the Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt, Brentano makes clear that intentional phenomena need not be sensible. He is aware that, even if intentional phenomena are always accompanied by sensible or sensational phenomena, they are not themselves sensational or sensible phenomena. And the presence of certain intentional attitudes is at least as certain and indubitable for us as is the presence of our sensations. If I make a certain judgment or ask myself a certain question, then I can know directly and immediately that I make that judgment or ask that question. (This is not to say, of course, that every intentional attitude may be the object of such certainty. Perhaps there is a sense in which you may be said to like or to dislike a certain thing without realizing that you like or dislike that thing.)\n\nIf I can know directly and immediately that I am making a certain judgment, then, I can know what it is to make such a judgment. And if I know what it is to make a judgment, then, in making the judgment I can know directly and immediately that there is a certain individual thing – namely, the one who makes the judgment. Arid I, of course, am the one who makes my judgments and does my thinking. The same is true, obviously, of my other intentional activities – such activities as wondering, fearing, hoping, desiring, considering, liking and disliking.”\n\n———. “Spatial Continuity and the Theory of Part and Whole. A Brentano Study.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 4 (1993): 11-24.\n\n“The concepts of a spatially continuous substance, of spatial dimension and of spatial boundary are here “analyzed out” of the concepts of individual thing, of constituent and of coincidence. The analysis is based upon the theory of spatial coincidence that was developed by Brentano. Its presuppositions are essentially these: (1) if there are spatial objects of any kind, then there are continuous spatial substances. (2) such substances are possibly such that they are not constituents of any individual thing; and (3) they contain constituents (namely, boundaries) which are necessarily such that they are constituents of spatial substances.”\n\n———. “Brentano on “Unconscious Consciousness”.” In Consciousness, Knowledge and Truth, edited by Poli, Roberto. 153-160.

Brentano’s views on intentional objects are first discussed, with special attention to the problems connected with the status of the intentional objects. It is then argued that Husserl overcomes these problems by help of his notion of noema. Similarly, in the case of perception, Brentano’s notion of physical phenomena is argued to be less satisfactory than Husserl’s notion of hyle, whose role in Husserl’s theory of perception is briefly sketched.”\n\nFugali Edoardo.

Brentano’s contribution to Aristotle scholarship is illustrated by reviewing some of his arguments against Zeller’s claim that Aristotle’s God, contemplating only himself, is ignorant of the world.

The immanence thesis is documented, together with its critical reception in Alois Höfler’s Logik, Twardowski’s Zur Lehre vom Inhalt und Gegenstand der Vorstellungen, and Meinong’s mature Gegenstandstheorie, in which immanent thought content and transcendent intentional object are distinguished, and Brentano’s thesis of immanent intentionality as the mark of the mental is reinterpreted to imply that only content is the immanently intentional component of presentations. Brentano’s thought from the early immanence thesis through the so-called Immanenzkrise and his later reism is explored against the background of his students’ reactions to the original 1874 intentionality thesis and its idealist implications, in the emergence of Meinong’s object theory and Edmund Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology. Finally, Brentano’s reism in the later ontology is critically examined, as his solution to ontic problems of immanent intentionality, limiting intentional objects to transcendent concrete particulars.”\n\n———. “Brentano’s Concept of Intentionality.” In The Cambridge Companion to Brentano, edited by Jacquette, Dale. 98-130.

Secondly the difficulties are discussed which Brentano saw in the Aristotelian semi-materialistic conception concerning the intellectual, as distinct from the sensitive soul from Brentano’s reistic point of view which and that it is an immaterial substance. Finally there follows a presentation of what is taken to be Brentano’s conception of the soul as it appears from a reistic interpretation of his analyses of the act of sensation and of the subject of sensation in order to shed some light on the reistic ontology that may be taken to underlie Brentanos’s psychology.”\n\n———. “Brentano’s Revision of the Correspondence Theory.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 3 (1993): 79-88.\n\n“Franz Brentano took exception to the classic statement of the correspondence theory of truth, the thesis: veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus. His reasons for objecting to it, and his proposed revision of the thesis, are interesting considered in themselves as well as for the light they shed on Brentano’s view of the relation between the thinker and the world. With regard to the former, it is shown how Brentano analyzes the adaequatio thesis word by word in order to demonstrate what he takes to be its fundamental incoherence. With regard to the latter, it becomes apparent, by contrast with the Thomistic understanding of the adaequatio thesis, that Brentano’s revision of it in the direction of a phenomenological theory of truth also involves a revised understanding of the nature of the thinker or knower.\n\n———. “Brentanian Unity of Consciousness.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 4 (1993): 89-100.\n\n“Brentano’s thoughts on unity of consciousness are of central importance to an understanding of his psychology and of his ontology. By means of a reistic interpretation of his views on unity of consciousness, and in contrast with the Aristotelian approach to unity of consciousness, one begins to see the paradoxically objective and realistic spirit of Brentano’s subjectivism in psychology.”\n\nKraus Oskar.

He categorized such ‘thoughts’ into three main groups: presentations, judgments, and love. By this unexpected latter term, he meant affectual attitudes.\n\nThe notion of ‘presentation’ in his system is both fundamental and difficult to grasp. Its essence is the idea that a cognitive agent can have a presentation of an object without it being the presentation of any particular object. One can entertain presentations of objects which do not nor could not have any real existence, like unicorns, golden mountains, and I suppose round squares. Achieving a presentation of something is the first step toward the other two types of acts, of which judgments concern us most.\n\nJudgments (and affectual attitudes or reactions) come in contrary pairs of affirmation and denial, the two modes of judgment. The basis for a judgment is a simple or compound presentation, so the root of the thetic/categorical distinction is in the definition of possible bases for judgments.\n\nThe basis for a thetic judgment is a presentation of an object: an entity or eventuality. An affirmation of such a presentation commits the judger to the existence of something which satisfies the presentation; a denial by contrast expresses a negative existence judgment.\n\nThe basis for a categorical judgment is compound: first a presentation which is clarified into a particular object satisfying the description, and then a property to be affirmed or denied of the object.\n\nDespite the conceptualist foundation of this system, I think we can model it with some familiar objects. Let us equate the notion of a presentation of an object for a description of an object. A description is something which can be satisfied by an object. Take object to range over both individuals and eventualities, and we have two sorts of descriptions: descriptions of an individual and descriptions of an eventuality. Properties we can take as basic, but crucially not as descriptions of an individual or an eventuality. The modified ontology then is summarized in (12):\n\n12.

Berin: de Gruyter, 2010.\n\n“It is not usual to think of Fichte as a logician, nor indeed to think of him as leaving a legacy that shaped the subsequent history of symbolic logic. But I argue here that there is such a legacy, and that Fichte formulated an agenda in formal logic that his students (and their students in turn) used to spark a logical revolution. That revolution arguably reached its culmination in the logical writings of Franz Brentano, better known as a founding figure of the phenomenological movement. In logical writings that were published only posthumously, but that were fully elaborated in the decade prior to the publication of Frege’s Begriffschrift, Brentano (together with his collaborator Anton Marty) developed a radically innovative logical calculus that was explicitly designed to overthrow the orthodox logical analysis of judgment and inference. At the center of this revolution was the notion of thetic judgment [thetische Urteil], a form of judgment upon which Fichte had insisted in the first published version of the Wissenschaftslehre, and which his students subsequently set out to accommodate within the framework provided by Kant’s general logic. But thetic\n\njudgment proved resistant to such assimilation, and it was left to Brentano to use the analysis of thetic judgment in his attempt to topple a long-standing logical tradition.\n\nIn what follows I reconstruct the main episodes in this century-long drama in the logical theory of judgment. My discussion is divided into four sections. I begin with a review of Fichte’s most explicit call for logical revolution, together with his introduction of the notion of thetic judgment, set against the backdrop of an anomaly within Kant’s logical commitments. In the second section I trace the logical treatment of this anomaly among Fichte’s philosophical progeny, in particular Johann Friedrich Herbart and Moritz Drobisch. The third section explores Brentano’s position, and his more radical solution to the anomaly bequeathed by Kant. In the final section I return to Fichte, to consider to what degree these subsequent developments remained faithful to the logical agenda Fichte had projected.”\n\nMayer-Hillebrand Franziska. “Franz Brentanos Wissenschaftlicher Nachlass.” Zeitschrift für Philosophische Forschung 6 (1952): 599-603.\n\n———. “Remarks Concerning the Interpretation of the Philosophy of Franz Brentano: A Reply to Dr. Srzednicki.” Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 23 (1963): 438-444.\n\n———. “Franz Brentano Einfluss Auf Die Philosophie Seiner Zeit Und Der Gegenwart.” Revue Internationale de Philosophie 20 (1966): 373-394.\n\nMazzù Antonino. “Psychologie Empirique Et Psychologie Métaphysique Chez F.

Edmund Husserl, while discarding much of Brentano’s conceptual framework and presuppositions, located intentionality at the core of his science of pure consciousness (phenomenology). Martin Heidegger, Husserl’s assistant from 1919 to 1923, dropped all reference to intentionality and consciousness in Being and Time (1927), and so appeared to break sharply with his avowed mentors, Brentano and Husserl. Some recent commentators have sided with Heidegger and have endorsed his critique of Husserl and Brentano as still caught up in epistemological, representationalist approaches to intentionality. I argue that Heidegger is developing Husserl, focusing in particular on the ontological dimension of intentionality, not reversing or abandoning his account. Heidegger’s criticisms of representationalism merely repeat Husserl’s. Furthermore, I argue that Husserl’s account of cognitive intentionality, which recognizes the importance of the disinterested theoretical attitude for scientific knowledge, has been underestimated and misunderstood by Heidegger, who treats scientific cognition as a deficient form of practice. In short, Heidegger is more dependent on Husserl than he ever publicly acknowledged.”\n\n———. “Franz Brentano: Descriptive Psychology and Intentionality.” In Introduction to Phenomenology. 23-59.

The exact nature of an object of our mental acts has, however, been first the subject of steady discussion in Brentano’s writings and consecutively gave rise to controversy for contemporary philosophers of mind; e.g. Chisholm, Castañeda. What follows is an elucidation of the relationship between Brentano’s final theory of sensation and its interpretation in Chisholm’s Direct Attribution theory as a consideration of a recent challenge by Castañeda: that while the Brentanian-Chisholmian account is exemplary in dealing with tacit self-reference at the level of unreflective consciousness, this theory needs to be developed even further to be adequate to those cases of self-reference involved in reflective consciousness.”\n\n———. “Kotarbinski and Brentano on Truth.” Topoi Supplement 4 (1989): 98-106.\n\n———. “Brentano and Aesthetic Intentions.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 4 (1993): 235-249.\n\n“Brentano’s philosophy of art, contained primarily in his book, Grundzuge der Ästhetik, is the result of an original theory of intrinsic value that was derived from Brentano’s philosophical psychology. In his aesthetics, Brentano endeavored to find an objective ground for the value of aesthetic contemplation through his theory of the intentional objects of emotions and desires. The lack of attention Brentano’s aesthetics has received is surprising, given that two of the many students Brentano influenced, Husserl (through the development of the phenomenological movement) and Ehrenfels (through the development of Gestalt psychology) have had an extraordinary influence on twentieth century perceptions of art. In this paper I will attempt to redress some of this neglect by outlining Brentano’s analysis of aesthetic intentions and the relationship his aesthetics bears to his overall philosophical system.”\n\n———. “Intentionality, Phenomenology and Sensation in Brentano.” Southern Journal of Philosophy 40 (Supplement) (2002): 269-279.\n\nPavlik Jan. “Brentano’s Theory of Intentionality.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 3 (1991): 63-70.\n\n“Brentano’s intentional psychology is an attempt at overcoming the Humean tradition characterized by probabilistic empirism, subjectivism and psychologism.

We will analyse Brentano’s proposals against the background of traditional logic. In his Formale Logik, Bochenski explicitly warns us that logic not only “does not give proof of a linear continuity of evolution”, but that the logic which follows a long period of decadence “departs, for the most part, from different presuppositions and points of view, uses a different technique, and develops previously neglected aspects of the problematic. It is a different form of logic”. I shall bear these remarks of Bochenski’s carefully in mind and I shall argue that mathematically-based modern formal logic and syllogistic theory of the past exemplify two distinct formal paradigms. My reference to two different paradigms, and not just to two different calculuses, implies that most of the syllogistic reformulations of this century are, broadly speaking, suspect; and specifically because they take the syllogistic to be a part or a fragment of first-order predicative calculus. Careful study of traditional logic immediately shows that traditional logic expresses specific ontological perspectives which are deeply embedded in its formal structures. From this point of view, Brentano’s theory is a brilliant attempt to escape from some of the most difficult impasses of traditional logic and offers tools for new developments. Unfortunately, it arrived too late, just as the Fregean paradigm was about to burst on the scene.”\n\n———. “Kotarbinski, Ajdukiewicz, Brentano: The Dispute About Reism.” In Polish Scientific Philosophy.

Even if the width and the depth of Brentano’s intellectual legacy are now well known, those asked to list the principal philosophers of the nineteenth century very rarely mention his name. We may call this puzzle the problem of Brentano’s ‘invisibility.’\n\nIt is obvious that Brentano’s invisibility has serious consequences on assessment of his philosophical theory. The reconstruction of Brentano’s thought is still flawed and incomplete. Moreover, Brentano’s emphasis on oral teaching, and the meagreness of his published work, compared with the enormous quantity of his manuscripts and correspondence, are also of theoretical importance because they are rooted in Brentano’s method of ‘doing’ philosophy. We know that the distinguishing feature of his philosophy was its empirical bias, its insistence on rigorous and partial answers rather than on the construction of systems. Given these features, it comes as no surprise that the same problem should be examined on several separate occasions and that different solutions should be proposed for it.\n\nThis procedure has a certain amount of inner coherence. Although Brentano always began his analysis with specific topics and problems, he proposed solutions which then reverberated through the entire edifice of his philosophy. This is a manner of philosophising which takes the natural sciences as its model. These factors also account for the different solutions that Brentano proposed for the problems he addressed. His thought, in fact, displays a continuity of method and a permanence of problems, but not a univocity of solutions. It is this aspect that allows one to talk of a school of Brentano among his pupils, to detect a ‘family resemblance’ among philosophers and scholars belonging to different disciplines. That is to say, the school is defined more by problems and the method used in their analysis than by their solutions in the strict sense. Accordingly, his heterodox followers, such as Carl Stumpf, Anton Marty, Alexius Meinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Edmund Husserl and Kazimierz Twardowski, were more faithful to their master’s thought than the orthodox Brentanians like Oskar Kraus, Alfred Kastil and Franziska Mayer-Hillebrand.\n\nOne further component of the Brentano puzzle is that a number of Brentano’s outstanding pupils achieved their own success and founded their own schools. Suffice it to mention Husserl’s phenomenology, Twardowski’s Lvov-Warsaw school and Meinong’s Graz school. The personal success and academic recognition attained by these exponents of Brentano’s school (in the broad sense) have come to obscure their common thematic origins. The sub–)`;Ýësequent split between analytic philosophy and phenomenology generated, as a side-effect, the oblivion into which Franz Brentano’s thought then fell.\n\nNevertheless, Brentano and his school display surprising affinities with Frege and the tradition that he inspired. Perhaps the most interesting reconstruction of these connections is that accomplished by a number of works in German by Paul Linke. It was thought that a survey of Linke’s thought might prove useful to English readers.

As far as the relation to the object exists, it is infallible – contrary to the fallible directedness at an external object. Brentanian intentionality is based on the evidence, and does not allow for degrees. Brentano has been careful to delimit his project of “Psychognosie” from the physical and from the physiological. The thesis of intentional gradation is discussed, which allows for three degrees. The first form of intentionality involves simple tropisms. The second grade of intentionality is the one of generality, as opposed to specificity and particularity. The third intentional grade would enable directedness to the singular.\n\nAs human organisms only are able to entertain directedness to the singular, brentanian intentionality would fall under the second kind of directedness, the one involving generality. Supposition that this thesis is right might then lead to the question whether Brentano really described intentionality specific for human organisms.”\n\nPrechtl Peter. “Die Struktur Der Intentionalität Bei Brentano Und Husserl.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 2 (1989): 117-130.\n\nRancurello Antos.

Though Meinong’s philosophical investigations from early on were very Brentanian in character, he came to develop views that diverged from certain doctrines of his mentor. In epistemology Meinong introduced the notion of immediate evidence of surmise in his views on memory and perception, whereas Brentano found this notion unacceptable. In descriptive psychology Meinong regarded feelings and desires as two distinct classes and introduced an additional class of mental phenomena called “assumptions”. Thus he opposed Brentano’s classification of mental phenomena into presentations, judgments, and acts of love and hate. In ontology Meinong allowed for non-real objects. In value theory he even introduced the notion of special irrealia corresponding to feelings and desires. Brentano, however, came to reject irrealia altogether. Such differences are discussed here, but attention is also given to the underlying and enduring philosophical affinity between Meinong and Brentano, namely their commitment to the ideal of scientific philosophy as attainable through descriptive psychology (what might be called “descriptive phenomenology”), which is concerned with intentionally directed consciousness as its subject matter and does not in any way differ methodologically from natural science.”\n\n———. “Brentano’s Logic and Marty’s Early Philosophy of Language.” Brentano Studien.Internationales Jahrbuch der Franz Brentano Forschung 12 (2006): 77-98.\n\n———. “Brentano’s Psychology and Logic and the Basis of Twardowski’s Theory of Presentations.” The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication (2009): 1-23.\n\nRossi Guido.

The latter concept cannot be grasped apart from its scholastic background and the Aristotelian-Thomistic doctrine of the multiple use of Being (to on legetai pollachos). The fact that Brentano abandoned the theory of the intentional inexistence in the course of time does not contradict the thesis that it is intentional inexistence and not the modern conception of reference or directedness to something other which comprises the essence of intentionality for the early Brentano.”\n\nRusso Antonio. “Franz Brentano E Heinrich Denifle: Un Carteggio Inedito.” Studium (2003): 333-356.\n\n———.

It will be shown that neither the pre-reistic Brentano espoused anything of an ontological account of the intentional object in that he both distinguished it sharply from the intentional correlate and definitely rejected the idea of there being different sorts of existence, and it will be argued that the apparently ineradicable inclination to ascribe to the pre-reistic Brentano an ontological account of the intentional object stems from ignoring the Aristotelian background of Brentano’s thinking about relations.”\n\nSchaar Maria van der. “Evidence and the Law of Excluded Middle: Brentano on Truth.” In The Logica Yearbook 1998. 110-120.

In later texts Brentano appears sharply critical of Aristotle, mainly in respect to Aristotle’s mereology, or theory of part and whole, and to his theory of substance and accident.\n\nIt is argued that Brentano hadn’t observed that Aristotle’s belief that there are as many predicative senses of ‘be’ as there are categories of being is based not on his mereology but on his theory of definition. Overlooking this Brentano was led to far reaching inadequate ontological consequences.”\n\nSimons Peter M., and Wolenski Jan. “De Veritate: Austro-Polish Contributions to the Theory of Truth from Brentano to Tarski.” In The Vienna Circle and the Lvov-Warsaw School, edited by Szaniawski, Klemens. 391-442.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.\n\n“Although Brentano generally regarded himself as at heart a metaphysician, his work then and subsequently has always been dominated by the Psychology. He is rightly celebrated as the person who reintroduced the Aristotelian-Scholastic notion of intentio back into the study of the mind. Brentano’s inspiration was Aristotle’s theory of perception in De anima, though his terminology of intentional inexistence was medieval. For the history of the work and its position in his output may I refer to my Introduction to the reprinted English translation. Alongside Aristotle the work shows influences of Descartes, Comte and the British empiricists. The theory of intentionality presented in the Psychology is much less modern and less plausible than almost all recent commentary would have it, and was in any case not where Brentano’s main interest lay. Intentionality simply served to demarcate mental phenomena from physical, in Book One, but the main aim was a classification of the mental, outlined in Book Two. Books Three to Five were to have dealt in detail with the three main classes of presentations, judgements and feelings, with the final book considering the metaphysics: mind-body and the immortality of the soul. Brentano’s shifting views, recently documented in English with Benito Muller’s translation of Descriptive Psychology, a work from the transitional 1890s, made the original plan obsolete. The role of an a priori, philosophical or descriptive psychology, methodologically prior to empirical-experimental genetic psychology, foreshadowed and influenced Husserl’s notion of phenomenology, and Brentano’s Comtean methodological epoche of desisting from controversial metaphysical statements in favour of an examination of the phenomena likewise presaged Husserl’s more ponderous phenomenological reductions.\n\nBrentano’s other work covers most areas of philosophy, notably ethics, where he upheld a form of a priori intuitionism much admired by G. E. Moore, the philosophy of religion, metaphysics, philosophy of language, deductive and inductive logic, and the history of philosophy. I shall mention just two areas. In his logic lectures from 1866 onwards (a compilation published 1956) Brentano rejected the subject-predicate analysis of simple judgements and proposed instead (for which he apparently secured written assent from Mill) that all judgements are logical compounds of positive and negative existential judgements. For example the universal judgement All men are mortal becomes the negative existential There are no immortal men. On this basis Brentano radically simplified the inference rules of deductive logic. While unlike de Morgan, Frege and others he does not go beyond logic’s traditional scope by recognising relations, within its bounds his reformed-term logic is simple, elegant and easily teachable. Some of his ideas in logic influenced the young Husserl. Unfortunately Brentano took against mathematical logic, which he wrongly associated exclusively with Hamilton’s confused doctrine of the quantification of the predicate. His inductive logic, which takes up by far the greater part of his logic lectures, remains unresearched to this day.” (pp. 118-119)\n\n———. “The Four Phases of Philosophy: Brentano’s Theory and Austria’s History.” Monist 83 (2000): 68-88.\n\n———. “Judging Correctly: Brentano and the Reform of Elementary Logic.” In The Cambridge Companion to Brentano, edited by Jacquette, Dale. 45-65.
