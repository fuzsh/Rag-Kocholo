Wittgenstein reminds us, “One keeps forgetting to go down to the foundations. One doesn’t put the question marks deep enough down”. In this book we have drilled down deeply to the foundations of the marketing discipline in order to understand the ideas, assumptions, and values of early marketing scholars and the intellectual influences on them. The research for this book draws extensively on the archives of those institutions that gave birth to the marketing mind.\n\nFoundations of Marketing Thought: The Influence of the German Historical School goes beyond the shallow chronicle of textbooks and university courses that has characterized much of the literature dealing with the history of marketing thought.
