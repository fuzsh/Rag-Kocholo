CHECK LIST OF REFERENCES ON CITY PLANNING Compiled by the DIVISION OF BIBLIO- GRAPHY, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, and the DEPARTMENT OF LANDSCAPB ARCHITECTURE, HARVARD UNIVER- SITY, under the editorial direction of H. H. B. MEYER, Chief Bibliographer, Library of Congress. PREFATORY NOTE. This list is based on material in the Li- brary of Congress and the Library of the Department of Landscape Architecture of Harvard University, with the addition of titles received from the State Librarians or the Legislative Reference Librarians of In- diana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachu- setts, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Is- land, Virginia and Wisconsin. The scope of the list is City Planning, defined by Frederick Law Olmstead, Charles Eliot professor of Landscape Arichitecture, Har- vard University, as “the intelligent con- trol and guidance of the physical- con- formation, growth, and alteration of cities, towns, or considerable parts thereof, con- sidered in their entirety.” This check list is divided broadly into two sections: one, devoted to writings dealing with the general subject, the other, devoted to writ- ings dealing with particular localities. In the former section the definition has been rather rigidly applied; in the latter, with considerable latitude. In its final form the list will be arranged according to a scheme of classification prepared by the Depart- ment of Landscape Architecture, Harvard University, printed in outline at the end of this list. The purpose of this preliminary check list is to meet an immediate demand, to show the extent of easily accessible material, and to disclose other material not in the list, so that in its final form the list may ap- proach more nearly to a true bibliography of the subject. It seemed desirable to have this check list in print in time for the Fourth National Conference on City Planning which is to be held in Boston on the 27th, 28th and 29th of May, 1912. The brief time available for its preparation has made it necessary to include certain entries in the form in which they were contributed by the several co-op- erators. In the final printing these will be made to conform to the practice of the Di- vision of Bibliography, Library of Congress. April 24, 1912. BIBLIOGRAPHY. American Institute of Architects.
