To an extent that should not be underestimated even today, this no doubt welcome development was due to the arguments about the war and its origins that the Hamburg University historian Fritz Fischer advanced in the 1960s. The controversies that he unleashed shifted research from the Weimar years and the Third Reich toward the pre-1914 period and the question of continuities and discontinuities in modern German history “from Bismarck to Hitler.”1 However, this is no more than a partial explanation of the rich scholarship on which the following chapters were able to rely. Our understanding of the Imperial period has also been expanded by research and debates whose scope went far beyond Fischer’s original concerns. Above all, the historiography of this period has benefited enormously from the pluralization of perspectives and methods that the discipline of History has experienced internationally. If political history continued to be at the center of academic teaching and research during the first two postwar decades, economic, social, and cultural history soon began to catch up, moving the discipline in many new directions. Indeed, what continues to characterize historical writing around the world today is its methodological and thematic diversity. There may still be “fashions,” but their influence is no longer comparable with the hegemonic position that political and diplomatic history once enjoyed. These developments have also provided us with a more colorful and sophisticated picture of modern German history. Historians began to research topics about which virtually nothing was known only a few decades ago. Whoever tried to write a comprehensive history of the years 1871–1918 in those earlier years would have found it impossible to synthesize developments in the country’s economy, society, and culture in ways that, at least theoretically, are available today. This dramatic change poses a great and daunting challenge. Those critical readers of this book who believe that we live in an age of specialization and fragmentation will presumably point out that the days of grand synthesis are over. I happen to believe that we should not—indeed must not—abandon the\n\nIntroduction\n\nattempt to write the history of an entire society in a given epoch instead of merely examining one or two of its microscopic parts. At the same time it would be naive to think that the richness of contemporary scholarship opens up the possibility of producing a perfectly wellbalanced textbook. Any general text is bound to take positions on past and current controversies; it will deal with open and perhaps unresolvable questions. When such points will be reached in later chapters, I will attempt to be fair and provide enough historiographical context without dubbing a particular argument that I happen to disagree with unceremoniously as “wrong.”2 Knowledge is too precarious to permit such apodictic judgments. It also seems to me more honest to clarify up front the most important premises that run through this study, as I certainly would not wish to mislead the reader into believing that I have all the “right” answers. What are these premises, and what is the larger historiographical context of this book? If the Fischer Debate was initially centered on the decisionmaking processes of July 1914 that triggered World War I, subsequent work, perhaps inevitably, turned toward the underlying causes of that catastrophic conflict. In this process, firmly held convictions about the basic principles of German foreign policy between 1871 and 1918 to the effect that they were exclusively determined by the country’s exposed geographical location “in the middle of Europe” came to be challenged.3 According to the older view, both Bismarck, the first Reich chancellor, and his successors had been haunted by the nightmare of foreign coalitions and by 1914 in fact felt “encircled” by a hostile combination of Britain, France, and Russia. The historian Eckart Kehr was the first to counter this view in the early 1930s when he rejected the notion of a “primacy of foreign policy” and put the concept of the “primacy of domestic politics” in its place.4 He agreed that the international predicament of the Hohenzollern monarchy was quite desperate in the years before World War I. But to him this was the result of a policy initiated by the Kaiser and his advisers in the 1890s. It was in those years that Germany embarked upon tariff and armaments policies that permanently antagonized Russia and Britain, the two major powers to the east and west of the country. Both responded by trying to contain the Kaiser’s ambitions. However, according to Kehr, German policies of the 1890s were not in themselves defensive reactions to an increased foreign threat; rather they resulted from a domestic pact that industry and agriculture concluded at this time against the perceived threat of a growing working-class movement at home that had begun to demand, ever more persistently and loudly, changes in the distribution of wealth, power, and influence inside Germany. It was Hans-Ulrich Wehler, above all, who subsequently applied Kehr’s “primacy of domestic politics” argument to the Bismarckian era.5 Like his successors, Bismarck, too, was assumed to have been driven not by a cauchemar xii\n\nIntroduction\n\ndes coalitions, but by the nightmare of a threatening social revolution. At first he attempted to deflect foreign policy dangers to the periphery of Europe by posing, in the wake of his wars of unification, as a man of peace. By claiming that the newly founded German Empire was a satiated power, he could concentrate on consolidating the internal power structures of the monarchical state. And when the success of this policy proved ephemeral at home, he tried—Wehler continued—to divert attention from his domestic difficulties by announcing a policy of colonial expansion. His main interest was not in overseas possessions but in blocking shifts in the existing imbalance of forces that favored the socioeconomic and political groups supporting the status quo and rejecting the demands of the lower classes and the industrial working-class movement in particular. It did not take long for the “Kehrite”6 position to be challenged by the diplomatic historians, who objected to the idea of seeing foreign policy as one element of a more comprehensive “history of society” (Gesellschaftsgeschichte) and reasserted the autonomy, if not the predominance, of a “political history in modern perspective.”7 Like their predecessors, they insisted that foreign policy making, operating, as it was forced to, in an anarchic international system and wedded to the principles of Social Darwinist power politics, had a dynamic of its own. In other words, scholars such as Andreas Hillgruber and Klaus Hildebrand refused to accept Wehler’s notion that foreign policy was an extension of domestic politics. Accordingly, they revived, in the 1970s, the older interpretation of the course of German history before 1914. They saw the containment of Germany by Britain, France, and Russia not as a backlash to the ambitious foreign and naval policies initiated by Germany at the turn of the century. Expanding on the positions of the 1950s, they now interpreted the world war as a consequence of the failure of the other powers, most notably Britain, to accommodate the dynamic and politically unpredictable Hohenzollern monarchy within the existing international system.8 With the burdens of responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1914 already reallocated in opposition to Fischer’s views, the British historian Niall Ferguson shifted the scenes even more radically. In a book published in 1998, he developed the theory that Britain’s entry into the conflict “was nothing less than the greatest error of modern history,” to which he then added a counterfactual that most of his colleagues thought even more dubious.9 However, the Fischer Debate also continued at another level. Even scholars like Wehler never accepted the Hamburg historian’s notion that German foreign policy before 1914 was in effect an aggressive “grasping for world power” that the Reich government had supposedly prepared ever since the famousinfamous War Council of December 1912.10 In this respect they found themselves in rare agreement with the diplomatic historians in their perception xiii\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat Germany’s plunge into war in 1914 amounted to a Flucht nach vorn, a flight forward from the impasse that the country was facing in those years.11 In other words, the Kaiser and his advisers did not exacerbate the crisis after the assassinations at Sarajevo in an overconfident mood, seizing this opportunity of establishing Germany’s leading position among the great powers; rather they made their fateful decisions in a pessimistic spirit in the face of a seemingly desperate situation of turmoil and isolation both at home and abroad. In searching for the causes of this impasse, some scholars have highlighted the incompetence and pathological learning that, they believed, marked the decision-making processes within the Prusso-German monarchy. Others have taken a more structuralist approach and related the seemingly ever more insoluble problems of the German Empire to the unstoppable advance of long-term processes. They saw industrialization, urbanization, and the increasing participation of the “masses” in politics as the cause of the impasse of 1914. What united the two historiographical camps was the conviction that the country had sunken slowly into a “polycratic chaos” and that it had become less and less governable.12 Finally, the 1970s also saw a revival of an older debate concerning the basic character of the Bismarckian Constitution of 1871 and its reformability. This time the issue was not so much whether or not the “personal rule” of Emperor Wilhelm II amounted to a degeneration of a political system that was basically sound;13 rather the question was whether the Prusso-German constitutional order had come to the impasse of 1913/14 as a result of a permanent crisis that had existed from the start.14 Manfred Rauh argued against this latter interpretation that the Kaiserreich was on the path of gradual constitutional change and was experiencing a silent parliamentarization. The center of political power, he maintained, was shifting from the monarchy toward the Reichstag, the democratically elected national assembly—a position that, as will be seen, was subsequently queried by Gerhard A. Ritter and others.15 However, more serious and more profound in its impact on the direction of research has been the challenge that the Kehrites faced from a group of British historians.16 Although, as confirmed social historians, they too had little taste for a return to a “primacy of foreign policy” approach, they began to criticize the type of “history from above” that Wehler and others had been writing. In their view, the history of the German Empire could not just be seen as the history of small manipulative elites, dominated by the big estate owners (Junker) and the archconservative captains of heavy industry, by an “alliance of rye and iron.” They maintained instead that, if one wished to understand the development of Germany, especially after 1890, the focus should be on the study of new social groups that were mobilizing themselves “from below” and were becoming increasingly vocal and organized in Wilhelmine politics. xiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe strength of this approach, which was indebted to Edward P. Thompson’s writings,17 was that it involved a shift toward the intensive study of living conditions, lifestyles, and daily experiences of the lower classes. Thenceforth, the door to this kind of social history was pushed wide open, encouraging a younger generation to explore its potentialities. More than that, Geoff Eley soon began to expand his earlier critique into a more fundamental challenge by questioning the viability of the Sonderweg hypothesis that was underlying not only the Kehrite view, but also much of the early postwar Anglo-American writing on modern German history.18 This older interpretation had postulated a divergence from the Western path and had drawn a more or less straight line of continuity back from the Third Reich to the late nineteenth century where, it was said, the roots of later disasters were to be found. These disasters were supposedly the result mainly of elite behavior and their politics that failed to respond to reformist pressures and to put the country on a track of modernization similar to that of the West. To Wehler this failure was a case of pathological learning. Eley now rejected the Sonderweg position, asserting that Germany, too, had undergone a “bourgeois revolution” like that in Britain and the United States. Proposing to “depathologize” the course of modern German history with its presumed failure of bourgeois liberalism, he also took the view that the one-sided emphasis on the dominance of preindustrial elites and their manipulation of the “masses” had obscured a more interesting and complex historical reality. Although in the Kehrite view the industrial workers had already found their own voice, causing much alarm among the elites, Eley stressed the self-articulation and autonomy of other social groups, and the lower middle classes in particular, that Wehler had seen as part of the antisocialist front.19 The Sonderweg debate with its various ramifications thus became the other major controversy of the 1970s and 1980s. It continued into the 1990s after Eley published an anthology that was designed both as a stock-taking of what had been achieved and as a stimulus to future research. Wehler could not find anything pathbreakingly new in the volume and expressed his disappointment in a sharply critical review.20 Overall, the situation therefore remains unclear. Thomas Nipperdey, agreeing with Eley, though coming from a different ideological vantage point, has insisted that modern German history has many continuities rather than just one leading directly to the Nazi seizure of power. Wehler and others have recently been more conciliatory and moved some distance toward Eley. Still, in the view of Jürgen Kocka, “key elements” of the Sonderweg hypothesis have “not been refuted by critical research, but have been confirmed.”21 This view is not shared by a younger generation of historians on both sides of the Atlantic who moved even further than Eley in the direction of a xv\n\nIntroduction\n\n“history from bottom up” and away from broad structuralist perspectives of the 1970s. In this respect they were influenced by larger trends in the discipline that stressed the fragmentation and indeterminacy of modern life and modernity. Interested in the daily lives of ordinary people, in women and minorities, they tried to retrieve the agency of individuals and collectives. They were seen to be in search of their identities, refusing merely to be swept along by larger anonymous historical processes. Accordingly, these scholars were looking for human subjects, often living at the periphery of the nation rather than in Berlin and Prussia, who were forging their own destinies. In short, many historians of Germany, like their colleagues specializing in other fields, took the “culturalist turn.” At the center of their work is not so much the analysis of the autocratic features of the Bismarckian empire, but its federalist diversity and its supposedly remarkable modernity.22 Accordingly, we now have studies that analyze not merely the no doubt rich cultural products enjoyed by Germany’s urban elites, but also the many varieties of popular and regional culture.23 In the course of this work, political culture also became a major interest. Following the arguments of David Blackbourn, who had criticized the Kehrites for their excessive Prussocentrism, he and others produced studies on the “second Germany” in the south and southwest. Soon came the Canadian historian James Retallack, who, by homing in on the kingdom of Saxony, discovered a “third Germany.”24 Brett Fairbairn, in taking up problems of voting behavior and political culture, argued against a narrow definition of the concept of democracy. Mention should finally be made of Margaret L. Anderson’s important study on how many ordinary Germans were “practicing democracy.”25 She shows that, notwithstanding many legal and political impediments put up by local elites and bureaucrats, Catholics, Left Liberals, and Social Democrats pursued their rights as voters courageously and insistently. This interest in processes of a fundamental democratization and of the multifaceted character of German society and politics on the American side was complemented and expanded on the German side by detailed work on the role of the middle classes and on the question of nation-building in the nineteenth century.26 After the industrial working class and their organizations had been at the center of research during the 1960s, the new focus on the Bürgertum yielded many fresh insights into the economic, political, and cultural history of this stratum in its various guises and into the emergence of a civil society in Imperial Germany.27 In this respect, too, the historiography of the country has been part of a larger current that was further enhanced by developments in Europe and other parts of the world since 1989. All this research and these debates have had a major influence on what is to be found in subsequent chapters. They will highlight the progressive pluralization of German society in this epoch. However, if the element of diverxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nsity is to be emphasized, we cannot ignore the slow formation of class lines, the “pillarization” of the Kaiserreich, and the emergence of larger political and ideological blocs. What follows revolves around the two concepts of pluralization and polarization, all the while also bearing in mind the question of who were the winners and losers in the historical process up to 1918. Indeed, in trying to assess the overall modernity of the German Empire and its ability to change and adapt politically to the diversifications of its society, economy, and culture, it is instructive to look at the losers. This is particularly true of the situation of minorities whose history—studied in considerable depth by the “new” social historians—is given a good deal of attention in this book. Overall it is my hope that a synthesis of recent research, that is, a history of German society in all its aspects, offers an opportunity to clarify not merely the contradictions but also the broader outlines of the development between 1871 and 1918. In this sense, this study is also an attempt to explain not why Germany ended up with Hitler in 1933 but rather why she went to war in 1914 and lost that conflict four years later. This, it seems to me, is an assignment that is difficult enough. A final word about the structure of this book. As a glance at the table of contents will show, it is not conceived in the tradition of a grand chronological narrative. Instead it is thematically organized, and, while each part follows a basic chronology, individual sections are designed to provide an overview of a particular topic. Whoever is interested, for example, in housing or the Polish minority will find relevant information in the respective subsection rather than having to look for it throughout the text with the help of the index. Among the various criticisms that the first edition of this volume received was the complaint that it ended with 1914. In response to this, a new section on World War I has been added. Finally, I hope that the statistical tables in the Appendix will be found useful. For easier use, their numbers appear in parentheses within the text, while cross-references in the footnotes together with the index should help the reader find related information in other sections of the book. For the first edition, I benefited from the comments of Klaus Bade, Keith Bullivant, Ute Frevert, Robin Lenman, Uta Poiger, Mark Ruff, and Hanna Schissler. I continue to be most grateful to them and to the authors of many excellent studies, both in German and in English, without whom I could not have developed this synthesis. The second edition was read critically by HansUlrich Wehler, Jürgen Kocka, and, as the first edition, by Marion Berghahn. It is again dedicated to her.\n\nxvii\n\nPart I: Economy\n\n1. Economic Sectors and Structural Change A. Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Services It is of fundamental importance for an understanding of Germany’s economic development in this period that the upward trend that had set in before the founding of the Kaiserreich continued in principle until the eve of World War I. There were, it is true, ups and downs, and there were also setbacks. But although these were perceived by contemporaries as severe depressions, we can now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that they were in effect periods of retarded growth, not reversals of the general trend. The net domestic product (NDP) provides a particularly clear gauge of these shifts. It saw a moderate rise from the 1860s onward, before it began to shoot up quite steeply from the 1890s. By 1890 it had reached a level of 20 billion reichsmark (RM), and by the outbreak of the war the figure had more than doubled again. Knut Borchardt, it should be added, has warned that the poor state of the available statistical material undermines the reliability of many of the detailed figures;1 but the task here is to discover the macroeconomic trend, and that is clearly discernible. The relative prosperity of the German national economy is also reflected in the fact that the additional millions of people that the population explosion of the late nineteenth century had produced were overwhelmingly absorbed by the labor market without a decline in living standards. Although income differentials remained large, in the long run a majority of Germans even enjoyed a higher living standard. Admittedly, the overall improvement was helped by some 1.8 million people who left the country during the third wave of emigration in the nineteenth century.2 The contribution made by different sectors of the economy to the generation of prosperity varied considerably, however. If we take the respective shares of the gross national product (GNP), we find that until the 1880s agriculture retained its lead at 35 to 40 percent over industry’s 30 to 35 percent. Thereafter the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and market gardening) went into relative decline. By 1913 the share was less than 25 per-\n\nEconomy\n\ncent. In that year the share of industry, mining, crafts, putters-out, and domestic manufacture amounted to 45 percent. Meanwhile the commercial and service sector hovered, more or less continuously, around a mark slightly above 30 percent. These changes were indicative of a structural transformation, related to the Industrial Revolution, that all European countries, sooner or later, began to experience during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, it would be mistaken to speak of a simple shift from an Agrarstaat, a nation based on agriculture, to one defined by its industrial base (Industriestaat). Klaus Bade is probably more accurate here when he spoke of a metamorphosis from an “Agrarstaat with a powerful industry to an Industriestaat with a strong agrarian base.”3 For this reason, we do not immediately turn to an examination of the process of German industrialization, but focus, in the first instance, on agriculture as the older sector of the economy. Indeed, up to a point it was the emergence of an agrarian capitalism in the first half of the nineteenth century that helped to pave the way for industry. Nor did mechanization and rationalization remain exclusively confined to the factory system. If agriculture saw a quantitative expansion of its production in the second half of the nineteenth century, this development was no longer due primarily, as in the past, to an extension of land utilization, but to increased productivity (Tables 1, 2, 4). Between 1903 and 1905 the increases for animal products and agricultural produce were even quite steep, before taking another dip toward 1914. In 1870 total agricultural output after deducting seeds, animal feedstuffs, and wastage reached 4,080 million marks in current prices. A peak was achieved in 1912 with 12,348 million marks, after which the total declined to 11,740 million a year later. Considering that the number of those employed in agriculture vacillated only slightly from 1895 to 1905 between 9,788 million and 9,926 million (Table 23), the above figures reflect productivity gains that were stimulated in part by increased demand from a rapidly growing population, but also by the more widespread use of fertilizer, better irrigation, improved winter feeding methods, and the introduction of modern agricultural machinery. If there existed some 268,000 simple threshing machines and 75,500 steam threshers in 1882, their number had expanded to 947,000 and just under 489,000 respectively by 1907. The number of mowers rose from 19,600 to 301,000 during the same period. In the 1860s, German agriculture had been an exporter of grain, before being hit by the overproduction crisis of the 1870s when American and Russian competitors appeared on the world market. For several decades Germany’s grain-growers huddled behind the protective tariff walls that, at their prompting, the government had erected after 1879. But after the turn of the century the Kaiserreich once again became a grain exporter. Still, not even these favorable developments were able to mask the structural problems of German agriculture during this period of continuous indus2\n\nEconomic Sectors and Structural Change\n\ntrialization. Time and again, industry proved more dynamic and productive. Employment figures mirror this very neatly. In 1913, it is true, agricultural employment reached its peak at 10.7 million (Table 23). But by this time industry (including crafts) had already overtaken the agricultural sector and now employed some 11 million people. This was an impressive change, also considering that the national economy, in which 18.6 million people had found employment in 1875, provided livelihoods for 31.3 million in 1914. Between 1900 and 1914 alone just under 6 million garnered jobs for the first time, most of them in industry and the tertiary sector. While many of them were children from the major cities, which had high birth rates, the rest were longdistance migrants, mainly from the agricultural northeast or the surrounding rural areas closer by. Millions of people left agriculture hoping for a better life in the cities and in industry (Tables 34–37). In his book Das Leben eines Landarbeiters (The Life of a Land Laborer), published in 1911, Hans Rehbein has described what it was like when he and other migrants saw the lights of the big city from their approaching train. The economic superiority of industry emerges even more impressively if we look at the expansion of production and employment in individual branches and their investment activities. In 1865 mining employed some 209,000 people; thirty years later there were 432,000, and the sector experienced another doubling of its workforce to 863,000 by 1913 (Table 23). The metal producing industries tripled their workforce between 1875 and 1913 from 150,000 to 398,000. Metal manufacturing saw similar increases. The textile industry employed some 926,000 in 1875, a figure that declined slightly to just under 900,000 by 1913. However, the clothing industry witnessed an increase in its workforce from a little under 1.1 million to over 1.5 million. The construction industry also registered remarkable growth from 530,000 in 1875 to 1.63 million in 1913. The most impressive growth rate can be found in the chemical industry, where employment increased from 65,000 to 290,000 during the same period. If we follow Rolf Wagenführ’s calculations, the annual industrial growth rate between 1866 and 1872 was 4.5 percent.4 During the years 1873–1890, which came to be seen as the period of the “Great Depression,” the average rate remained at 3.0 percent per annum before jumping to 4.5 percent between 1890 and 1913. After the founding of the Empire, the growing demand for raw materials and energy led to a further rise in coal production from 47 million tons in 1880 to 191 million in 1913. Germany was now in third place in coal production behind Britain and the United States. Meanwhile iron and steel saw even greater production increases. In this field, Germany moved into second place before World War I, outproducing the British (Table 5). Up to the 1870s, demand for iron and steel was particularly strong in railway construction. During the 1850s the length of track in Central Europe had almost 3\n\nEconomy\n\ndoubled to 11,326 kilometers. Close to another 8,000 kilometers were added in the following decade, only to be outdone by the addition of 9,000 kilometers in the first five years after the founding of the Kaiserreich. After this, the network’s growth proceeded at a slower pace to reach a total of 61,000 kilometers by 1910, of which just under 12,000 kilometers of track had been laid since the turn of the century. The length of the road system also doubled. During the boom period after the founding of the German Empire, railways had been the leading sector. Thereafter it lost this role to other branches, above all to steel, machine tools, and the new industries of the “second Industrial Revolution” (especially electrical engineering and chemicals). In 1861, some 8,647 machines had been manufactured in Prussia. In 1875 their number had risen to almost 36,000. Later automobiles and electrics experienced their first boom period. By 1907 Germany had close to 26,000 cars and 1,211 large trucks. During the next five years alone these figures rose to 83,000 and 9,700 respectively. Unlike the steel and automobile industries, chemicals had a very wide range of products. In addition to the steep rise in its workforce, already mentioned above, the success of this branch is best reflected in two statistics. To begin with, its average annual growth rate was 6.2 percent; second, so impressive was the expansion of the most successful chemical companies that no fewer than 12 of them ranked among the 100 largest German enterprises a mere twenty years after their first boom period. Concentrating increasingly on the production of synthetic materials, organic chemistry quickly reached a leading position on the world market for dyes and pharmaceuticals. In 1900, Germany’s share in dyes was 90 percent of world production. Another good indicator of major structural changes affecting the national economy is provided by net investment rates. After 1870 the figure usually hovered around 10 to 11 percent for agriculture (Table 7). With the exception of a period of retarded growth between 1875 and 1879, industry’s share was at least three times that figure, finally reaching a mark around 43 percent between 1905 and 1913. At the time of the founding of the German Empire, capital invested in industry came to just under 10 billion marks in current prices; the figure for 1913 was over 85 billion. This was also the year in which industry’s return on capital (including mining) was almost twice as large as that of agriculture. In view of the rapid overall growth of industry, it was almost inevitable that the tertiary sector would also benefit. The connection is clearest with respect to commerce and banking.5 The abolition of customs barriers when Germany became unified as well as the boom of the founding years are very directly reflected in the expansion of financial institutions. As regards commerce, it must be remembered that Germany by the late nineteenth century had become one of the world’s major trading nations. In 1880 it exported 4\n\nEconomic Sectors and Structural Change\n\nproducts (including foodstuffs) to the tune of 2.9 billion marks, among them finished goods worth 1.4 billion. By 1913, exports had risen to just under 10.1 billion marks. The share of finished goods was now almost 5.4 billion, that of semi-finished goods 2.1 billion. However, the trade balance remained marginally negative for most years before 1914, reflecting the country’s great appetite for imported raw materials (Table 8). All in all the German Empire became an exporter par excellence of high value-added goods promoted on the world market through repeated export offensives. Meanwhile capital exports reached 23.5 billion marks by 1914, reflecting the growing importance of banking. Nevertheless, the share of the tertiary sector in the number of employed or the NDP was never as high as that of the industrial sector. While the number of jobs grew in commerce, banking, and insurance, the figure for domestic servants declined sharply, even if—as will be seen—there were not merely economic but also social reasons for this (Table 23). B. Wealth and Incomes The macroeconomic processes that have been described so far had inevitable consequences for the hierarchies of wealth and income in the Kaiserreich. The differences were most striking with respect to wealth. In 1896/97 the top 10 percent of the Prussian population owned no less than 59 percent of all personal assets. By 1911, this share had increased further to 63 percent. These disparities, which were only in part due to huge income differentials, provided the critics of the existing social order with plenty of ammunition. The long-term structural changes that worked against agriculture and favored industry can also be traced in this particular field. The developments of the late nineteenth century demonstrated ever more clearly that ownership of factories carried with it greater productivity and higher profits than could be achieved by the owners of agriculturally used landed property. After land prices had been high in the 1860s in the wake of the agricultural boom, they declined during the following two decades and recovered only marginally thereafter. Only those who held land in areas with expanding cities saw their property values rising sharply. Selling landed property was frequently also made difficult or even impossible because of high mortgages or legal restrictions (e.g., estates held as a Fideikommiß and thus subject to strict inheritance rules within the family). Nevertheless, in the mid-1880s there existed close to 18,000 estates of over 100 hectares in Prussia’s eastern provinces and some 25,000 in the whole of Germany (Table 3). Among the wealthiest estate owners were the Pless (83 estates with 70,139 hectares), the Henckel von Donnersmarck (58 estates with 38,388 hectares), and the Schaffgotsch (939 estates with 31,011 hectares). Many landowners were thus sitting on assets whose value was considerable, if declining. But inheritance rules and other restrictions made it difficult for 5\n\nEconomy\n\nquite a few of them to realize their assets. If, on top of it all, owners were ignorant of financial affairs or too conservative to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace, estates and farmsteads could quickly become a burden whose weight was further increased by mortgage debts. Only through rationalization could the individual farmer hope to cope with the impact of the above-mentioned structural crisis of agriculture. Some were astute and lucky, and thus able to turn the corner. Many more did not prove competent enough to operate successfully in the capitalist marketplace. They were now forced to tighten their belts, if they hoped to retain their property and save it from the great “butchery of the estates” that occurred. Between 1885 and 1900 alone, some 5,000 large estates went bankrupt. A telling example of the anguish that this engendered is the case of Udo Count Stolberg-Wernigerode, descendent of an ancient noble family. In the middle of the 1890s he had to sell his townhouse in Berlin because he could no longer afford the high overheads of running it. Such experiences reinforced a sense of bitterness and led to political activism.6 As Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, very much a Prussian Junker and Conservative deputy in the Reichstag, put it in 1904, “being poor,” as large numbers of Germans then were, was in his view “no misfortune”; but he had no doubt that falling into poverty definitely constituted one.7 A way of life, so it seemed to many, was simply being obliterated by the forces of capitalism and modernity, with political consequences that will be analyzed in Part IV below. Meanwhile, those who had invested their money in industry and commerce no doubt found the long-term augmentation of their wealth very gratifying, provided they had spread the risk and were good at exploiting market opportunities (Table 7). To be sure, there were also those who found that the risks they had taken had been too high. They could easily lose all their assets unless they had limited their liability in line with the provisions of the Commercial Code of 1861. Whoever was shrewd enough to survive the difficult early phases of building a business or recurrent recessions could look forward to a bright future, especially if he had hitched himself to one of the growth industries. It is difficult to know the exact increases in wealth to be gained in industry, commerce, or finance. The statistics of the Inland Revenue Service offer at least a few glimpses, even if they presuppose considerable trust in the individual taxpayer’s honesty. Thus, in 1896 the Prussian tax inspectors counted 1,600 individuals with an annual income of over 100,000 marks. That year also showed up 9,265 individuals who declared incomes between 30,500 and 100,000 marks. This was a gigantic sum at a time when the average annual income from wages and salaries was around 740 marks (Table 14). Until 1912 the number of individuals in the two categories above increased to 4,456 and 20,999 respectively. If\n\n6\n\nEconomic Sectors and Structural Change\n\nin 1896/97 some 5,440 Prussian taxpayers were listed as millionaires, their number had grown to 9,349 by 1911 (Table 17). That those who were making their money in industry were doing very well is also reflected in the impressive homes they built for themselves. In 1873 the Villa Hügel of Friedrich Krupp, the Prussian “Cannon King,” was completed, overlooking Lake Baldeney south of Essen in the Ruhr area. As square and forbidding as it was ostentatious, the building had close to 270 rooms. Benjamin Disraeli, the British prime minister and a man quite used to imperial splendor, has left us a description of a reception that he attended at the residence of Gerson Bleichröder, Bismarck’s private banker.8 Walther Rathenau, who, together with his father Emil, was the driving force behind the rise of the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG, General Electrics) and who by 1909 had business links with no less than eighty-four other large companies, acquired a stately home, Schloß Freienwalde, near Berlin, and there were others like him who bought up imposing country homes that had once been in the hands of aristocratic families. However, it is not even necessary to inspect these manifestations of rising prosperity. It is sufficient to walk through the Hamburgian suburb of Pöseldorf today, through Bismarckallee in Bad Godesberg on the Rhine just south of Bonn, or through the posher parts of Berlin to look at some of the Jugendstil villas to gain an impression of the wealth that the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie began to accumulate from the late nineteenth century onward. Of course, not everyone who had started in a small workshop or as a retailer made the leap into big money. For many of the self-employed it remained a hard struggle. They lacked capital, initiative, or simply good luck. And many craftsmen stubbornly put out goods that machines could produce much more cheaply. Although they formed associations for their economic self-protection and occasionally succeeded in obtaining government help, capitalist competition time and again proved too much for the less efficient. If, on the other hand, a small workshop was able to become a supplier to a larger enterprise or to move into a new business niche such as electrical installation or precision tool making, a firm base for further expansion might be reached. In the meantime the existence of most members of this so-called Old Mittelstand of artisans and small shopkeepers remained precarious. Accordingly, the share of the self-employed declined from 25.4 percent to 18.8 percent between 1882 and 1907 (Table 22). The New Mittelstand of white-collar employees in industry and commerce, whose share in the labor force rose from 4.7 percent to 10.7 percent during the same period, presented a different picture. According to Prussian statistics, the number of those who earned 900 to 3,000 marks per annum increased from 2.5 million to 6.8 million between 1896 and 1912, that is, by\n\n7\n\nEconomy\n\n167 percent (Table 16). To be sure, not all of them saw their salaries go up. At Maschinenfabrik Esslingen near Stuttgart, for example, white-collar employees received around 1,800 marks per annum. During the boom year of 1900 salaries averaged around 4,151 marks, but between 1910 and 1912 they declined to 3,500 marks (Table 14). The electrical engineering firm of Siemens paid its white-collar employees around 2,800 marks in 1895, but barely more than 2,620 marks per annum in 1912. Civil servants were not only well provided for in their retirement, but they also witnessed an improvement in their annual incomes from an average of 1,306 marks in 1870 to 2,607 marks in 1913. During that year Bavarian public servants even achieved an average of 2,823 marks. At the time of the founding of the German Empire, postal employees, who had civil service status in Germany, earned 698 marks per annum; in 1913 the figure had more than doubled to 1,550 marks. During the Wilhelmine period the head of a provincial district (Landrat) could expect an annual income of 3,300 to 4,800 marks. On top of this he would receive some 6,000 marks in expenses, from which he had to pay his assistants and entertainment. At the turn of the century, the famous physicist Max Planck disposed, as full professor at Berlin University, of a salary of 4,400 marks to which was added a housing allowance of 900 marks per annum. His membership in the Academy of Science gave him another 900 marks for expenses. Meanwhile, in 1884, the great majority of physicians practicing in Berlin earned up to 3,000 marks per annum. All these statistics must be seen in context, however. They were average incomes, and by 1914 the average annual earnings of the German population as a whole (i.e., including top earners) had not reached more than 1,334 marks (Table 16). In 1912 there were some 8.2 million working men and women in Prussia who took home less than 900 marks per annum and who, except for a few pieces of furniture, did not have any assets (Table 18). This represented no more than a 5 percent decrease on the same category for 1896. It means that well over half of all the taxpayers of Prussia, where two-thirds of the total German population lived, belonged to the lowest income group and that these people participated in the wave of prosperity during the two decades prior to World War I in no more than a very limited way. In 1870 the average annual income of industrial workers and craftsmen had been 506 marks (Table 14). Twenty years later, they earned 711 marks, and finally in 1913 they reached 1,163 marks. Miners, who belonged to the labor elite, saw their wages rise from 767 marks in 1870 to 1,496 marks in 1913. The average wages paid in agriculture mirrored the general economic difficulties of this sector. Annual earnings here (including forestry and fisheries) were a mere 350 marks in 1870. This figure increased to 417 marks by 1890 and to 682 marks by 1913. In addition, land laborers and servants had free room and board. 8\n\nEconomic Sectors and Structural Change\n\nA high percentage of these servants were young women whose remuneration varied considerably but was regularly lower than the wages of their male counterparts (Tables 29–31). Many of them therefore moved to the cities to seek employment as domestic servants with middle-class families. Housework was often onerous, and the workday was long. In Berlin, the city with the highest wages, an Alleinmädchen could expect 100 to 250 marks per annum. If the woman decided to find a job in industry, she could expect better pay and also more leisure time, but suffered even greater wage discrimination in comparison with men. There are a few statistics relating to gender-specific wage differentials in Stuttgart in southwestern Germany for 1900. The average weekly wage there for men was 22 marks, for women a mere 9.57 marks, that is, 43 percent of the rates for men. In some other occupations the share was as low as 36 to 37 percent. Wage scales also reflect these inequalities. Thus no more than 1.1 percent of the males—but 70 percent of the women— earned below 12 marks per week. Among the professions (for example, in education) discrimination was no less glaring, and in comparison with men, women were also less frequently promoted.9 All statistics that have been quoted so far merely relate to nominal incomes and therefore provide an incomplete picture of the economic situation of millions of people. They must be correlated with the development of prices. Taking the period 1871–1914, it can be said that the living standards of the majority of the population increased slightly, and certainly there was no recurrence of the mass pauperism that Central Europe had experienced before the onset of the Industrial Revolution. We still lack reliable calculations of real wages (i.e., inflation-adjusted) for the period up to 1914. Some scholars have spoken of increases of 92 percent, others of 37 percent. In the 1880s the index of real wages dipped repeatedly. It recovered in the 1890s, and in the last years before 1914 wages and salaries kept just ahead of the rate of inflation. The figures that D.V. Desai has calculated give a more favorable overall picture (Table 13).10 More importantly, averages tend to veil the difficulties that many families experienced, especially in times of recession. This becomes very evident if we compare the above-mentioned average wages with the figure issued by the Reich Statistical Office as a minimum living standard: 1,300 marks per annum. For the city of Bochum in the Ruhr industrial district we also have a list of welfare recipients (Table 71). According to this document, 20 among every 1,000 inhabitants required permanent assistance, while another 20 on average needed help on a temporary basis.11 Meanwhile many families, who did not rely on welfare, time and again slipped below the poverty line, even if the wife and children took up part-time or temporary jobs. These conditions can also be reconstructed from a number of family budgets that have been found (Table 67). At the time of the founding of the Ger9\n\nEconomy\n\nman Empire, workers spent some 60 percent of their income on food and drink. After the turn of the century, the figure was closer to 40 to 45 percent. In 1907/8, a skilled worker needed no less than 51.5 percent of his annual wages for food, 16.8 percent for rent, 11.2 percent for clothing, and 4.2 percent for heating and light. Once the sums for personal hygiene, insurance, and leisure had been deducted, there remained 1.1 percent for emergencies. This was not much, and if unemployment or illness struck, the larger items had to be cut back—with far-reaching consequences for housing and the nutritional standards of the whole family.12 In this respect the consumption power of the middle classes was not only considerably bigger, but their greater ability to put aside savings also prepared them better for harder times. The figures presented above appear to confirm the introductory statement that the German national economy experienced a period of overall growth up to 1913/14. But we have also found that there were ups and downs, and even underlying structural problems. Furthermore, different social groups were very differently affected by these developments. Finally, there were not only sectoral but also regional shifts. The next section will deal with this set of questions.\n\n2. National and Regional Economic Developments A. Gründerboom, “Great Depression” (1873–1895), Expansion and the Onset of Recession (1896–1913/14) The above-mentioned ups and downs in the German national economy hinted at the importance of conjunctural factors. Although the macroeconomic trend was broadly upward, the economy was prone to overheating or spluttering from time to time. The very long waves in the development of the world economy since the Middle Ages are relatively well researched. More immediately relevant for the history of the German Empire are the more short-term vacillations that Wassili Kondratieff and Arthur Spiethoff among others have studied.13 They identified two phases during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first phase began with an upswing that lasted from 1844/51 to 1870/75. There then followed a slowdown that came to an end two decades later, to be replaced by the second upswing phase that continued, with various smaller vacillations, until just before World War I. Economic and social historians have worked particularly intensively on the years from 1874/79 through 1890/95, known as the “Great Depression.” However, most experts agree today that these years were in effect a period of retarded growth. Nor was it a deflation across the board. Industries were affected unevenly, some sooner and others later; some were on the road to recovery as others began to experience difficulties. If the years from 1874/79 through 1890/95 no longer seem to justify the term “Great Depression,” on 10\n\nNational and Regional Economic Developments\n\nthe basis of the available economic data, the question of contemporary perceptions still remains, and here it has to be said that many people firmly believed the 1870s and 1880s to be very bad times—an important point to bear in mind, also to understand people’s political responses in this period (as examined in Part IV). Looking at the more short-term oscillations, there is first of all the boom that began just before the founding of the German Empire in 1871. The year 1866 was the last one to see a mild recession and a credit crunch. Thereafter, helped by the prospect of German unification under Prussian leadership following the violent ouster of Austria from Central Europe, and also accelerated by the magnetic force that the Ruhr, the industrial heart of Prussia, exerted on southern German states, the economy began to pick up very quickly. A few indices, such as the rapid expansion of the railway network, have already been mentioned.14 Pig iron production, which in 1866 had reached 1 million tons, had similarly experienced a 50 percent increase by the time of the founding of the German Empire (Table 5). Coal production stood at 26 million tons in 1870—a 114 percent increase since 1860. Other indications of an impending boom can be found in feverish investment activities and in the growth of the banking industry. Railroad stocks were doing so well that some companies were able to pay dividends of up to 8 percent, the Berlin-Magdeburg Railroad Company even 20 percent. Commerce and the chemical industries also began to flourish. For the moment, agriculture was not doing badly either. There was strong demand, and production of cereals, meat, milk, and eggs went up (Table 1). All this prosperity paled in comparison with the boom that set in after 1870/71. During the next four years the same number of iron works and machine manufacturing companies were founded as “in the seventy years since 1800.”15 The capital sunk into these and hundreds of other stock-holding firms amounted to 2.8 billion marks, thus surpassing by 400,000 marks the total of investments made in the previous two decades (Table 7). During the twenty years before 1870 the coal and iron industries had attracted some 69 percent of investments, followed by textiles (16 percent). The share of metal manufacturing and chemicals was a mere 8.5 and 2.0 percent respectively. The years 1870–1874 witnessed a marked shift in these shares. Coal and iron shrank to 38 percent, textiles to a mere 6.5 percent. Metal manufacturing now attracted 22.5 percent, while chemicals more than doubled their share to 4.5 percent. Some companies in the industrial centers of unified Germany had more orders than they could fill. In Essen, Krupp expanded his workforce between 1870 and 1873 from 7,000 to 12,000. In 1846 the “Cannon King” had employed a mere 140 workers. However, the upswing was much more muted in the textile industry than elsewhere, and more generally it is important to bear in mind a highly differ11\n\nEconomy\n\nentiated picture. As before, banks played a key role during those years, and not just in the channeling of French reparations payments, which likely provided an additional economic stimulus. No less than 103 banks were registered on the stock market between 187l and 1873. The bigger ones among them fared so well that they were able to pay dividends of between 12.5 and 20 percent (Table 9). The average dividend payments between 1870 and 1872 were 12.49 percent, implying an equivalent yield of 8.64 percent. The industrial boom coincided with favorable conditions in agriculture. The value of cereal production rose continuously from 1,698 million marks in 1870 to 2,692 million marks four years later (Table 1). Meat production went up by 50 percent. But the “crash” was not far away, ushering in the period of retarded growth from 1874/79 to 1890/94. The coal industry was hit hard from the start. The index of its prices fell from 116 points in 1873 to 49 in 1879. Prices for textiles meanwhile declined by a mere 23 percent, while other branches tried to balance the shrinking of their domestic markets by increased exports. Accordingly, the volume index for German foreign trade rose from 17.7 to 24.9 points between 1873 and 1878. Other companies resorted to price fixing in collaboration with their competitors and began to form cartels.16 Workforces were reduced, in some cases quite drastically, and production was further rationalized. This helps to explain why the number of blast furnaces fell from 379 to 210 between 1873 and 1879, whereas the iron production that had reached its peak of 2.2 million tons in 1873 never slipped lower than just under 2.0 million tons. Indeed, in 1879 it had almost climbed back to the 1873 figure, and it continued to rise slowly throughout the 1880s. Similarly coal production only once fell below the 36.3 million tons of 1873, and this was in 1874. It then hovered between 37.5 million and 39.5 million tons, until reaching just over 42 million tons in 1879. Thereafter the slow growth continued during the 1880s. These figures have led Reinhard Spree to argue that the “Great Depression” first started as a trend reversal in heavy industry and began to affect the consumer industries only from 1876 onward.17 The economy restabilized from 1877, albeit on a lower level of production, employment, and profitability. Spree also believes that the banking crash has been exaggerated. The retrospective analyst who looks at the available statistics may come to this conclusion with equanimity. But there is also the fact that 73 of 139 credit institutes had to close their doors and that the number of bankruptcies also rose in other branches. The stock market reacted nervously, and some 444 stockholding companies saw their prices cut almost in half. In the late 1870s, most large banks barely paid more than a dividend of 6 percent (Table 9). Shareholders in Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft did not receive any dividends between 1876 and 1878. Not everyone had enough in the kitty to absorb losses. 12\n\nNational and Regional Economic Developments\n\nAbove all, the psychological impact of this period cannot be overestimated. Businessmen experienced setbacks; they heard what was happening to their friends and competitors; they read about the crisis in the newspapers. The cumulative effect of all this influenced the economic climate for years to come; much of the optimism of the early 1870s was gone; people were less inclined to invest in risky ventures; above all, they complained loudly and constantly about the low prices and the allegedly unfair practices of their competitors. The depth of these feelings explains why the basic mood showed no marked change when the economic situation improved for a brief period in the early 1880s. The next slowdown followed in 1886–1890, though it was less dramatic than that of the 1870s. If the net domestic product had been negative during the previous ten years, in 1886 it edged back to 0.6 percent, rising to 4.0 percent in the following year and reaching 4.2 percent and 4.7 percent in 1888 and 1889 respectively. Yet, even now the business world did not regain its former bullish mood. Whoever had capital to invest would put it into bonds and securities. Investments beyond the borders of the Reich became more popular and should probably also be seen in connection with the clamor for the acquisition of a larger colonial empire.18 While the “Great Depression” occurred more strongly in the minds of entrepreneurs and businessmen, it is much more directly reflected in the period’s agricultural statistics. Here the downturn after the years of prosperity in the early 1870s coincided with a structural crisis that—as has been mentioned— was a consequence of the fact that the wealth-creating capacity of industry simply proved so much greater than that of agriculture. Despite continued population growth, the value of grain production declined from its 1874 peak of 2.7 billion marks by about 20 percent in the years thereafter (Table 1). Meanwhile meat production stagnated, while the total worth of milk and egg production oscillated around the 1874 level. Unlike in the industrial sector, these figures barely saw an improvement during the temporary upswing of the early 1880s. A glance at net investment figures confirms this picture of stagnation (Table 7). In comparison with 1865/69 they had declined by more than half to 10.3 percent as early as 1874, and until 1895 they never went above the average of 11.5 percent. Even during the most gloomy years, the rate in industry was more than three times this average. It was clear that, faced with poor results, the agricultural sector lacked the means to modernize and thus to improve its prospects for the future. In the early 1890s, the end of the “Great Depression” finally appeared on the horizon. In 1891 the net domestic product (in 1913 prices) had once more slumped to 0.0 percent. However, it reached 4.1 percent in the following year and 5.0 percent in 1893. Thenceforth the economy experienced an upswing that lasted until 1913.19 It was interrupted in 1900/1 and 1907/8 by two brief, though serious, recessions. Next to the stock market figures, the period of pros13\n\nEconomy\n\nperity can also be traced through investment levels in the industrial sector (Table 7). In 1896 they reached 2 billion marks (in current prices) and climbed to 3 billion marks in 1898. After the turn of the century, the average remained below the 2-billion-mark level for several years, before rising again to an average of just under 2.8 billion marks between 1904 and 1906. Following a peak of 3.7 billion marks in 1907, the average until 1911 leveled out once more at around 2.3 billion marks. The highest level of the entire prewar period was finally achieved in 1912 at 4.0 billion marks. Many of these investments could not have been made without resorting to the capital market. The issue of new shares may serve as a convenient guide to the measure of industrial growth in this period. And indeed, total stockholdings increased from just under 6 billion to over 16 billion marks between 1895 and 1913. After the recession of 1907/8 Germany saw another “strong increase in the issue of industrial shares” in 1909,20 with lower levels in the following two years. But this did not affect profitability nor the level of dividends. The year 1912 was the last year before the war with high rates of growth and investment, accompanied by many new share issues. It was a sign of a possible further reversal of the prewar trend that the volume of trade in industrial shares witnessed a tangible decline thereafter. A contemporary explanation of this may be found in the following comment by the Volkswirtschaftliche Chronik: “Conjunctural influences can be recognized clearly here. It shows at the same time that banks, in view of strongly rising inflation and unfavorable stock-market conditions, found it more difficult to convert short-term loans to industry into stocks and long-term loans. This is also why they held back with making new loans.”21 How well German industry had been doing between 1895/96 and 1912/13 may also be gauged from the fact that iron production doubled and steel production trebled during this period (Table 5). By 1893 Krupp had around 24,000 workers, in 1912 as many as 68,000. The production index for textiles reached 63 points in 1900 and rose to 102.9 in 1912, before declining to its yardstick of 100 a year later. The ascendancy of the industries of the second Industrial Revolution has already been mentioned.22 Cars were manufactured in larger and larger numbers. If the production index for the chemical industry had reached 42.5 points at the turn of the century (1913 = 100), it had almost doubled by 1910 (Table 6). Similarly commerce could look back in 1912/13 on a 20-year era of almost continuous growth, which took it from 60.9 index points in 1895 to 100 in 1913. Banking, which had a major share in the upswing of the national economy, grew from 22.8 index points in 1895 to 100 in 1913; credit cooperatives even grew from 16.5 (in 1895) to 100 (in 1913). As has been mentioned, agriculture participated in this prosperity. Total production increased, and yet the agricultural sector was unable to exploit the opportunities in the same way as the other two sectors (Tables 1, 2, 4). Exist14\n\nNational and Regional Economic Developments\n\ning gaps grew wider. It could not raise enough capital for long-term investments, and it remained more vulnerable to the ups and downs in the economy (Table 7). Thus the recession of 1900/1 resulted in a sharp decline in wheat production from 3.2 million tons to 2.0 million tons, which a simultaneous 12 percent increase in potato production could hardly compensate for. Once this recession was over, a moderate growth in agricultural production was restored, but it was undermined by occasional years of underproduction. Meat production developed along similar lines. Finally, the unemployment figures, now more systematically collected, provide a rough guide to how the economy was faring (Table 21). B. Regions and Regional Shifts, Infrastructural Change Just as the sectors and branches experienced the macroeconomic movements differently, the same can be said for the various regions of Germany.23 In agriculture, regional variations were determined by the size of the units, the quality of the soil, and local inheritance laws. In 1878, the total agricultural area was 36.7 million hectares, of which 25.8 million had been taken under the plough. The rest consisted of grassland, orchards (10.5 million hectares), vineyards (0.13 million hectares), and gardening (0.4 million hectares). In the nineteenth century, the line of primogeniture ran along a line quite close to the western coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the north to the Dutch border and the Lower Rhine. Here it turned sharply east into Thuringia (with the exception of parts of Hesse), before making another turn through Franconia, finally dividing Baden and Württemberg from Bavaria in the south. By this measure, the regions east of the river Elbe from Mecklenburg to East Prussia may be regarded as a contiguous agricultural region. This was the land of large-scale estates, whose sandy soils were best suited for cereal and potato crops. There were also the woodlands that as late as 1905 made up some 46.4 percent of landed property in Prussia. Although this region had been opened up to market-oriented methods of land management, it remained rooted in many ways in practices and attitudes that were precapitalist.24 As far as the northwest of the Reich is concerned, Schleswig-Holstein may be seen as a region that was structured differently from the territories east of the river Elbe. Particularly along the North Sea coast, freehold farmsteads of five to fifty hectares predominated, whose specialties were meat production and dairy farming (Table 3). The fertile soils of Dithmarschen, just north of the mouth of the river Elbe, were well suited for cabbage and sugar beet. In the eastern parts of Schleswig the soil became sandier again, and farmers concentrated on animal husbandry. The arable land was used “primarily for the production of animal feedstuffs.”25 There were also a number of large estates near the Baltic Sea coast; but most of the so-called Geestbauern had small farms, situated like those of Holstein in a landscape of hills and woods. 15\n\nEconomy\n\nThere were many regional similarities between Schleswig-Holstein and the northern Rhineland, the Province of Westphalia, and the areas stretching further east towards Hanover and Celle, known as the North German Basin. The west’s rich soil, it is true, is replaced further east by sandier soil up to the more fertile region around Magdeburg; but there were few large estates here, and agriculture was devoted to dairy farming as well as the production of cereals, potatoes, and beetroot. In the Rhineland and in Westphalia a mere 1 percent of all farmsteads were larger than fifty hectares. Small farmers were also found in large numbers in the entire Rhine valley region further south all the way up to the Swiss border and eastward in Württemberg. Unsuited geomorphically for large-scale agriculture, the family enterprises along the river Rhine and its tributaries (Nahe, Main, Neckar) specialized in wine and fruit production. Animal husbandry and dairy farming, as well as the production of grain and hops, prevailed further east in Franconia and Bavaria. The region had a number of large estates; but the majority of peasants did not own more than one to ten hectares of land. Hesse and Thuringia also had mostly small holdings, with forestry as an important element in this mountainous region. Mixed patterns of agriculture were found in Saxony, whose real significance lay in the fact that it was one of the oldest industrial regions of Central Europe. Since the eighteenth century, if not before, the kingdom of Saxony and the Silesian territories further east had been a center for textile production that for a long time had been organized on a protoindustrial basis. Here underemployed peasant strata had adopted cottage-industrial production. Raw materials were provided by putters-out, who also marketed end-products. As early as the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries many villages in the Eichsfeld east of Göttingen, in the Thuringian Forest, and in the uplands along the rivers Elbe and Oder in Saxony and Silesia had a high percentage of weavers and spinners. Slowly, with the advent of larger power looms and steam engines, these industries underwent a process of concentration, leading to the building of factories that would house dozens of workers under one roof. However, many of the old putting-out networks did survive into the 1870s. The textile industry’s decline thereafter was further hastened by the rise of the chemical industry, which developed around Halle-Merseburg and Leipzig and, in conjunction with the exploitation of the region’s lignite deposits, transformed the area into central Germany’s industrial heart. With the elevation of Berlin to Reich capital, however, there arose further north not only a commercial and financial center, but also an industrial competitor for Saxony. Berlin became the home to many companies in the fields of metal manufacturing and electrical engineering. Yet, neither Berlin nor Saxony, nor much less Hamburg, a focal point of shipbuilding and metal manufacture, was able to compete with the industrial region along the rivers Rhine 16\n\nNational and Regional Economic Developments\n\nand Ruhr, or with the Wupper River Valley and the Siegerland. However severely its heavy industries had at first been affected by the “Great Depression,” the region, which had a long tradition of coal and iron production, benefited from the growing importance of the metal industry. Technological developments, moreover, made possible the mining of deeper-lying coal deposits of the so-called Emscher Zone on the northern fringes of the Ruhrgebiet. It also proved advantageous that the Rhine provided a major waterway and that western Europe and many of Germany’s important trading partners were within easy reach. Further south, Frankfurt emerged as a manufacturing center, promoted, as in the case of Berlin, by the city’s long-standing position as a hub of commerce and finance. Among the older industrial regions, mention must also be made of the upper and lower Neckar River Valley. In Stuttgart and Neckargemünd, metal manufacturing had a long tradition. Further north, on the banks of the Rhine and the mouth of the Neckar, Mannheim and Ludwigshafen attracted the flourishing chemical industry. Munich, the Bavarian capital, never achieved the significance of Berlin or Frankfurt as an industrial center. But apart from Augsburg, the region around Nuremberg established itself as a manufacturer of toys and metal goods. Location was obviously an important factor in the success of a particular industrial region. But in view of the continued growth of the German economy— which slowed during the 1870s and 1880s but expanded rapidly thereafter— it is difficult to speak of a decline in any of them, only of a strengthening of one region over another. The region of the Rhine and Ruhr unquestionably gained a dominant position, which it defended into the second half of the twentieth century. At the end of the nineteenth century, Saxon industry tried to overcome its locational handicap with the building of the Mittellandkanal. The project ran into bitter opposition from agrarians, to whom the canal represented not a waterway for the transportation of raw materials and finished goods to and from Saxony, but an avenue for a flood of cheap grain imports from North America. Building canals and making rivers navigable became an important state activity, and shipping grew from 1.6 billion ton/kilometers in 1870 to 17.8 billion in 1913. Meanwhile the railroads were of even greater importance, for all industrial regions. It is no accident that the first German railroad line was opened between Nuremberg and nearby Fürth in 1840. Other lines soon followed between Munich and Augsburg in Bavaria and between Magdeburg and Dresden via Halle and Leipzig in Saxony. By 1912 over 60,000 kilometers of tracks had been built. In 1870 the railroads transported 5.3 billion ton/kilometers of goods; by 1913 this figure had risen to 67.7 billion. The comparable figures for railroad passengers increased almost tenfold between 1871 and 1913. Wolfgang Schivelbusch has written a fascinating book about this “industrialization 17\n\nEconomy\n\nof time and space” and about the impact of the railroads upon the mentalities of contemporaries.26 Thenceforth, distances that had seemed huge began to shrink. Remote villages suddenly were brought into the catchment area of cities. Fresh fruit and vegetables reached the markets of densely populated industrial regions. Time-keeping became standardized. In 1893, Central European Time was introduced for the whole of the Reich. Road traffic meanwhile also proliferated. In the countryside and in villages, carts and coaches remained the most important means of transportation. The first horse-drawn streetcar opened in Berlin in 1865. By 1881 Siemens had developed an electric tram that ran between Berlin and nearby Lichterfelde. The western city of Wuppertal erected the Schwebebahn, which, suspended from pylons, ran above the meandering river Wupper. In 1896 Berlin opened the Hochbahn, a commuter system on elevated tracks. Hamburg built a similar system. Bicycles enjoyed a rising popularity toward the end of the nineteenth century. From the middle of the 1890s automobiles became the craze for those who could afford them. The slow expansion of paved overland roads promoted bus and motorized postal services. They were able to reach remoter parts of the country that the railroad companies had bypassed. To be sure, this was not yet the age of mass motorization. Germany remained behind the United States, France, and Britain in the number of cars per capita. Passenger cars remained luxury items, custom-made mostly in small workshops. It is important to emphasize that this was not yet the age of mass production and mass consumption. At most mass entertainment had arrived on the scene, mainly in the form of movies. In the centers of many of the big cities, it is true, the first department stores opened their doors, trying to attract customers to buildings that looked like palaces and to entice them with lavish displays of desirable goods. Department stores tended to attract the well-todo and particularly middle-class women with time on their hands and money to spend. Given the tight budgets of working-class families, they might travel, for example at Christmas time, from their poorer neighborhoods to the center to window-shop and to look at the festive glitter. The building of railroads and the advent of automobiles also benefited postal services. The invention of the telegraph and later of the telephone further accelerated and facilitated communication in unprecedented ways. In 1872 the German postal service expedited around 972 million messages of all kinds. By the turn of the century, this figure had risen to 5.7 billion. In 1913 the number of letters and parcels alone handled by the Reichspost amounted to 5.9 billion. In 1872 some 12 million telegrams were sent; in 1910 it was four times that number. Similarly, the number of telephones spread quickly after the turn of the century. In 1910, Germany had l million telephones, and the exchanges connected some 1.8 billion calls.\n\n18\n\nThe Organization of Industry\n\nUnder British leadership the global cable network was greatly expanded, reinforcing the integration also of German industry and commerce into the world economy. The above-mentioned growth in exports and imports (Table 8) stimulated not only shipbuilding but also commercial shipping. Until the mid-1880s the transport capacity of tall ships continued to be larger than that of steamboats. By 1910 the latter had a combined space of 2,185,890 register tons (BRT), and it doubled once more to 4.4 million BRT by 1913. By then the total for tall ships had declined to around 440,000 BRT. Technological developments, such as the steam turbine and later large diesel engines, further enhanced the position of the German commercial fleet. Norddeutscher Lloyd and the Hamburg-Amerika-Paketfahrt Aktien-Gesellschaft (HAPAG) became the two major shipping companies. In 1913 no fewer than thirtythree large passenger steamers and freighters of over 10,000 BRT had been put into service, and several of these even had a capacity of over 50,000 BRT. Germany now held second place behind Britain among the world’s commercial fleets. All in all it may be said that the expansion of communications provides a good mirror of the modernizing impulses that the German national economy received before 1914. Even if structural changes, the ups and downs in the economy, and geography affected some individual branches and sectors negatively, overall the German Empire gave the impression of strength and vitality. Only agriculture fell more and more behind—with consequences we shall investigate in later chapters.27\n\n3. The Organization of Industry The evolution of capitalist industrialization and urbanization is inseparably connected with the phenomenon of increased organization that affected both the economy and all other spheres of life in the second half of the nineteenth century. We first turn to the organization of the various local and national markets. A. Labor Markets, Capital Markets, and Cartels There was a marked increase in the number of working men and women between 1871 and 1913 from 17.3 million to 30.9 million (Table 28). This amounted to an average annual growth rate of 1.2 percent. However, considerable imbalances developed due to the migrations from agriculture to industry and to the tertiary sector.28 Moreover, the above absolute figures must be correlated with the employment rate, which was partly determined by the country’s age structure, the share of working women, the age of entry into the labor market, and the average retirement age (Tables 27, 29). Until 1880 the\n\n19\n\nEconomy\n\nemployment rate vacillated around 43 to 44 percent, rising to 46 percent by 1913. Similarly the share of working women saw little change, remaining at around 30 percent, notwithstanding the shifts that occurred between agriculture and industry as well as within the tertiary sector, where the number of domestic servants declined, while that of female office workers (“white-blouse” occupations) went up (Tables 29–31).29 Furthermore, the decline of child labor and the extension of education and training for young people must be taken into consideration when we look at the relative stability of the employment rate. Reasonably reliable calculations of the unemployment figures and rates exist only from 1887 onwards (Table 21). But these statistics refer only to industry and crafts, and therefore the actual figures were certainly somewhat higher. In 1887 the unemployment rate was below 1 percent, but hovered around the 4-percent mark a year later. There was another decline in unemployment in 1890 and 1891, before it reached a peak at roughly 6 percent the following year. Later, at the end of the 1890s, the rate leveled off again at a little higher than 1 percent. It reached a high of 7 percent during the recession of 1901/2 (with over 630,000 unemployed). After this date the statistics that had been kept by trade unions up to then were complemented by official records. Above all, the rate stabilized at between 2 and 4 percent until 1913. In the last year before the war some 350,000 unemployed were once more on the books, which was seen by some as another sign of a trend reversal in the economy. These developments as well as the steady stream of people looking for employment put pressure on the labor market to become better organized. Agriculture—except in the case of purely family-run farms—had for a long time hired its laborers on a daily basis every morning in accordance with demand. But the massive flight to the cities and into industry moved the estate owners to offer steadier employment conditions, whose further advantage was that it facilitated firmer social control and, in the age of mass politics, also control over the land laborers’ voting behavior.30 Faced with a scarcity of labor, the large-scale estates in East Elbia were moreover forced to rely on migrant workers, most of whom were Poles from the Russian parts of the former “Congress Poland” who were sent back at the end of each season. These employment practices increased tensions with the Tsarist empire, especially toward 1914; it also undermined the anti-Polish Germanization policies of the Prussian government.31 In any case, as early as the 1890s the Agricultural Chambers in the east began to organize regional labor exchanges. In 1903, with the support of the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, the nationalist Society of the Eastern Marches (HKT) and the Pan-German League temporarily appeared on the scene. Finally, in 1905 the Central Office for German Land Laborers was founded, which, after considerable bureaucratic wrangling, ulti20\n\nThe Organization of Industry\n\nmately succeeded in 1908/9 in centralizing the existing systems of labor exchanges. Through this system, as well as innumerable private agencies, well over 500,000 migrant workers came to Germany every year, most of them Poles. One can easily imagine the social and openly racist prejudices encountered by these poorly paid “Polacken.” Their situation as third-class laborers was reinforced by political and ideological problems.32 At this point it must suffice to note that it was an odd agricultural labor market that emerged in the east, one in which the workers—indigenous ones included—had virtually no rights. Industry could not have survived with this kind of a system. Cottage industries were suited only for certain types of jobs. Factory production and the handling of fairly complex machines required workers who could not simply be hired on an ad hoc daily basis. Although industrial workers remained virtually without legal protection against dismissal, the employers’ interest in uninterrupted production demanded that most branches acquire a core of skilled workers, and these in turn could insist on greater job security than agriculture was able to offer. These circumstances affected the organization of the nonagricultural labor markets. At first the employers merely kept lists designed to prevent the hiring of Social Democratic “agitators.”33 Later employers developed and ran exchanges, that is, organizations that acted as intermediaries between employers and those looking for work. Increasingly, the government began to assume a role in this field. Thus, local authorities organized exchanges through which domestic servants and unskilled laborers were placed. Although the employers, above all in mining and the metal industry, were able to preserve their predominance in this area, the government did gain a foot in the door. Its role became fixed in the Prussian Placement Law of 1912, which indicated that those looking for work would no longer be completely at the mercy of the employers. The introduction in the 1880s of a social insurance system had enhanced workers’ material and legal positions, even if Bismarck had his own political considerations when he devised this system.34 In short, there was a close connection between the growing demands of modern factory production and the organization of the labor markets. The same is true of the organization of the capital markets. The capital requirements of the national economy, the rise of financial institutions, and the changing needs of employers and the public administration have already been mentioned. In organizing capital markets, banks were bound to assume a key role, and not just because private bankers were personally liable and shareholding institutions operated under limited liability. The latter were able to expand their capital basis considerably during the early 1870s and thus gained levers to influence the national economy as a whole. However, it is the model of the “universal bank”—developed from the concept of the French crédit 21\n\nEconomy\n\nmobilier institution—that is fundamental to the increased power of the German banks. As the name indicates, “universal banks” were not just credit institutions that attracted savings accounts and then provided short-term loans to whoever was deemed credit-worthy. Unlike their British and American counterparts, German banks were allowed to act as brokers on the stock market and even to acquire and sell shares for their own gain. Indeed, they could engage in virtually all financial matters. They could acquire a stake in an industrial or commercial enterprise and then exercise their voting rights at the annual meeting of shareholders. These organizational and legal conditions explain why German credit institutions were less interested in short-term high profits than in the long-term health of those companies in which they had a direct or indirect interest. Whereas British banks rarely offered more than an overdraft facility, German banks made a long-term commitment to the firms of their choice. Thus, a close relationship developed between banking and industry as a result of which expanding and successful enterprises were able to base their investment planning on strategic projections. Even before Rudolf Hilferding published his famous book in 1910 under this title, the argument could be heard that “finance capital” had gained the upper hand in this relationship. More recent research indicates, however, that it was a more balanced, genuine symbiosis that both sides nourished as mutually beneficial and without a constant desire to dominate. The rise of joint-stock companies such as the Deutsche Bank, Commerz- und Disconto Bank, or Dresdner Bank was certainly promoted by their links with rapidly growing firms such as Siemens and AEG, although some companies, particularly in the chemicals industries, also reinvested a large share of their profits. Private bankers, because of unlimited liability requirements and other factors, had to be more cautious, but their role in the organization of Germany’s capital markets should not be underestimated. Many of them were active in the field of industrial investments or they floated lucrative public loans, often also as agents of foreign governments. The wealth that Gerson Bleichröder accumulated not only for his most famous client, Otto von Bismarck, but also for himself was generated by a long string of successful transactions on the capital markets of Europe. Among the large banks, Deutsche Bank’s growth was particularly impressive. Its share capital, which included that of several larger regional banks, amounted to 691 million marks by 1911. It had reserves of 238.5 million marks. Siemens & Halske and Norddeutscher Lloyd were among its major customers. Deutsche Bank, in cooperation with Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft and Bankhaus Delbrück, Leo & Co., supported Emil Rathenau in building up his AEG empire. Its top executives were represented on the supervisory boards of other important industrial and commercial enterprises. In the southwest, Darmstädter Bank in conjunction with Schaafhausener Bankverein mediated 22\n\nThe Organization of Industry\n\nagreements in 1905 between Badische Anilin- und Sodafabriken (BASF), Bayer, and Agfa, three of the up-and-coming chemical firms. Meanwhile Dresdner Bank promoted the further expansion of Saxon industry, but also of the Felten & Guilleaume Cable Works in Cologne. Other well-known big banks were engaged in the mining and steel industries. Given their commitments to industry, most larger banks were more interested in attracting major investors rather than ordinary people, who held relatively small savings. The latter, whose cumulative wealth was anything but insignificant, were courted by communal savings banks (Sparkassen). Nor were their customers interested in risk papers like stocks; rather, they wished to have their funds securely invested for retirement. Accordingly, the amounts held by these institutions trebled in the decade after 1870. At the time of the Kaiserreich’s founding, Saxony alone had no fewer than 142 savings banks with some 474,272 accounts. They held a total of 115.7 million marks. Twenty years later the number of savings banks had risen to 220, with 1.6 million accounts and 581.7 million marks. In 1914 the total for Saxony was 361 institutions, holding just over 2 billion marks (Table 19). By 1913 the customers of all savings banks had entrusted to them some 19.7 billion marks. This was four times the amount that was held by the eight largest joint-stock banks. To be sure, individual savings banks often remained so tiny and bound to their localities that they could do no more than provide small loans. However, the credit needs of artisans, shopkeepers, and farmers were often considerable, especially in economically hard times. This is where cooperative banks came in. They were credit associations whose members shared, through the capital they had put in, the cooperative’s profits and losses. Members could also obtain loans at favorable rates. The great popularity of this type of credit institution is reflected in its membership figures. In 1870 cooperative banks had 314,656 members; by 1913 this number had increased to over 800,000. The total number of these associations doubled to 1,500 during the same period. A separate system of cooperatives developed to cater to the credit needs of agriculture, three quarters of which belonged to the Reichsverband der landwirtschaflichen Genossenschaften, the rest to the Raiffeisen-Verband. The latter was more centralized and offered its members other services besides loans. With the agricultural sector’s indebtedness rising under the impact of the “Great Depression,” and given the above-mentioned general structural crisis of this sector, the traditional system of lending continued, that is, private loans at often very high interest rates. This kind of lending had a bad reputation, though not always justifiably so. Of course, there were many cases in which the usurer unscrupulously exploited the plight of a particular peasant. But there were as many lenders who would not immediately confiscate property the moment a borrower was in arrears with his payments. This, and the 23\n\nEconomy\n\nfact that many usurers were non-Jews, did little to prevent the fanning of antiSemitic resentments in many rural areas on which politicians then tried to capitalize in the age of the universal male suffrage.35 Finally, mortgage banks emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as an alternative to credit associations. Like the universal bank, this type of credit institution was modeled on the French example. Mortgage banks operated under strict legal rules, which were further strengthened at the turn of the century, that did not allow them to help in any emergency. Moreover, the lending activities of these banks shifted increasingly from the rural to the urban market. In the face of the country’s demographic explosion, there arose a growing demand for mortgages to finance city housing. Builders and developers were as a rule also able to offer better securities than farmers whose properties were frequently overburdened with other mortgages. Founded in 1875, the Reichsbank stood at the top of this highly diversified financial system with responsibility for currency and interest rate policies. Reichsbank shares were held by private investors who had little influence on its policies, though. The bank’s president was appointed by the Kaiser. The banknotes issued by the Reichsbank were increasingly backed by the country’s gold reserves, by 1913 up to 45 percent. The base rate was held as low as possible to promote economic growth. Yet, however well the German banking system may have been equipped organizationally and legally to support the expansion of industry and commerce, the available capital resources always remained tight and in fact became even scarcer toward 1914. The serious indebtedness of agriculture sucked too high a proportion of investors into a sector that was structurally weak and declining. The public sector’s growing need to borrow proved an even greater drawback. The costs of armaments, which kept mounting from the late 1890s because of the Kaiser’s ambitious naval program, bloated the Reich budget. At the same time the federal states and local governments became no less reliant on the capital market to cover their deficits, which they found more and more difficult to remove through politically sensitive tax increases.36 Ultimately, the capital markets suffered from the fact that Germany—where more broadly based wealth was a recent phenomenon—did not stand on as firm a financial basis as, for example, did Britain. In no other area is this weakness evidenced more clearly than in the difficulties to make foreign investments on a larger scale, even if this seemed desirable for both economic and strategic-political reasons. Even in the years of prosperity before 1914, the cake was simply too small to cater for all those needs, private and public, at home and abroad. Finally, there were the commodity markets. In organizational terms, they underwent a major change that was to have consequences for the development of Germany’s industry and commerce well beyond the lifetime of the German Empire. According to liberal-capitalist theory, these markets were to 24\n\nThe Organization of Industry\n\nbe exclusively subject to the laws of supply and demand. These laws supposedly determined the movement of prices and the volume of production. The market was thus endowed with a self-healing capacity. It would correct temporary imbalances in supply and demand by making adjustments in prices or production respectively. Another advantage of this system was said to lie in the mechanism of competition in the open marketplace, which would result in the disappearance of weak enterprises. The slowdown of the 1870s with its many bankruptcies demonstrated that there was some truth in this argument. Prices slumped, and many firms that had been founded in the heady days of the Gründerjahre lacked the financial strength and stamina to survive until demand picked up again and the economy righted itself. Faced with hard times, businessmen had been inclined before to throw their professed support for the principle of competition overboard and to seek p"
