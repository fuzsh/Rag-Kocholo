        "text": "In wars called the Crusades, Christians from Europe fought Muslims for control of Jerusalem and other holy places. The word crusade comes from the Latin word crux, meaning “cross.” The Christian soldiers, called Crusaders, wore the cross as a symbol of their religion. The Crusades took place between 1095 and 1291.\n\nJerusalem is a holy city to several religions. Muslims controlled Jerusalem for hundreds of years before the Crusades. However, they allowed Christians to make pilgrimages to the city. In 1071 a new Muslim group called the Seljuk Turks took control of Jerusalem. They were hostile to Christian pilgrims. They also attacked the nearby Byzantine Empire, which was Christian.\n\nThe Byzantine emperor feared that the Muslims would attack Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), his capital. He asked the pope in Rome for help. In 1095 the pope urged Christians to take back Jerusalem.\n\nThe main army of the First Crusade left Europe in August 1096. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem on July 15, 1099.\n\nMost of the Crusaders returned home after the First Crusade. Others stayed in the Holy Land and established Christian states. In 1144 the Turks captured one of the Christian states. German and French rulers then called for the Second Crusade. It was a failure for the Christians.\n\nThe Muslim leader Saladin conquered Jerusalem in 1187. The kings of England, France, and Germany launched the Third Crusade against him. They were not able to recapture Jerusalem. However, the English king signed a peace treaty with Saladin in 1192. It allowed Christian pilgrims to visit holy places in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade started in 1202. The Crusaders planned to attack the Muslims in Egypt. However, the plan changed when the Crusaders passed through Venice. The Venetians got the Crusaders to capture Zara (now Zadar, Croatia), a Christian city that competed with Venice for trade. Then the Venetians and the Crusaders seized Constantinople. In 1204 they looted the city.\n\nIn 1212 two separate groups of children set out for Jerusalem. Some children died during the difficult journey. Others were captured and sold into slavery. Neither of the Children’s Crusades got near Jerusalem.\n\nFrench and German Crusaders reached Egypt in1218 as part of the Fifth Crusade. In 1219 the Muslims offered to give up Jerusalem if the Crusaders would leave Egypt. The leader of the Crusaders refused. Later he was defeated.\n\nFrederick II, the Holy Roman emperor, set out on the Sixth Crusade in 1228. He signed a treaty with the leader of Egypt that gave the Christians control of most of Jerusalem. In1244, however, the Turks took Jerusalem back. This led to the Seventh Crusade in 1249. Louis IX, king of France, was the leader. He was captured and held before being released in 1250. In 1270 Louis led the Eighth Crusade. He died of plague, however, and the Crusade failed.\n\nThe Crusaders then lost their fighting spirit. In 1291 the Muslims recaptured the last of the Christian states in the Holy Land."
