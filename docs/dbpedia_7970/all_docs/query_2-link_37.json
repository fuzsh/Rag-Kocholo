        "text": "Introduction  The Story of the Crusades\n\nJerusalem was the Holy City of the Christian religion, but it was part of the Turkish empire, and the Turks were Muslims.\n\nIn 1095, the Pope asked the people of Europe to go on a crusade to conquer the Holy Land for Christianity. Over the next four hundred years, thousands of Christians went to fight the Muslims:\n\nStudy these Sources, then answer the question sheet by clicking on the 'Time to Work' icon at the top of the page.\n\nWhy go on Crusade?\n\nThere were many reasons why people went on crusade. Some were genuinely religious men. Also, the Pope promised all crusaders forgiveness for their sins; this was important for knights who had killed people in battle, and believed that they were going to hell. Other knights actually went to kill and steal  at home, kings encouraged the most violent nobles to go on crusade, because it got them out of the country!\n\nTo go on a crusade was adventure. The Holy Land was full of different sights and unknown goods. Young knights could prove how brave they were. Sometimes the younger son of a great lord  who did not expect to inherit his father's lands  would go on crusade to win land. Villeins joined the crusades, because the Pope promised them freedom if they went to fight.\n\nResults of the Crusades\n\nIn the East, the crusaders discovered all sorts of things they had never seen before, such as lemons, apricots, sugar, silk and cotton. They discovered new spices (used in cooking) and new perfumes. While the crusaders were fighting the Muslims, European merchants were sailing to the Holy Land and trading with the Muslims for these goods!\n\nThe crusaders realised that in some ways the Muslims were more civilised than the Europeans. The Muslims knew much more about medicine. They were also better at mathematics: Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, 4. etc.) were easier to use than Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.).\n\nThe Muslims knew more about geography. In the Holy Land, the crusaders heard about unknown lands in the Far East, and they realised that the world was a bigger place than they had thought. In 1275 a European, Marco Polo, visited China.\n\nThe crusades led to improvements in armour and castle design in the West. One Chinese invention that found its way to Europe was gunpowder  a discovery that changed warfare.\n\nThen, in 1492, Christopher Columbus tried to find a new way to bring spices from the Far East to western Europe without going through Muslim lands. He used Muslim mathematics to work out the size of the earth, and Muslim geography to find a way to sail west to China. As a result, he discovered America ... and 1492 is often said to be the date when the Middle Ages came to an end."
