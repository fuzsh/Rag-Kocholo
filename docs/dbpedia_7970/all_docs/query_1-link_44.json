        "text": "Do we really need another “Batman” story?\n\nThat’s one way of looking at it. You could also ask if there can ever be enough “Batman” stories and, as a longtime fan, I can answer with a resounding NO.\n\nWhich is why I recommend “Batman: Caped Crusader,” the new 10-episode animated series that comes to Amazon Prime on Thursday, Aug. 1. It’s not the best Batman ever. (I’ll go with “The Dark Knight.”) It’s not the worst Batman ever. (Like everyone else, I’ll go with George Clooney in “Batman & Robin” — including George Clooney.)\n\nIt’s not even the best animated Batman, an honor that goes to “Batman: The Animated Series,” with which it has something important in common: creator Bruce Timm.\n\nBut I liked it, with its period-piece details and its tweak on the origin story of Batman and some of the more famous villains (the same, only different) and most of all the pervasive darkness of the whole thing, in both look and depiction.\n\nWho is the voice of Batman in 'The Caped Crusader'?\n\nHamish Linklater is the voice of Batman and Bruce Wayne in \"The Caped Crusader.\"\n\nHow does 'Batman: Caped Crusader' stack up against other Batmans?\n\nIt’s more than a worthy addition to one of the most storied franchises.\n\nThe series is set in what appears to be the 1940s, all art deco and dramatic lines, and a throwback to the original Bob Kane and Bill Finger comics — a look I like. I don’t know if the sun ever actually shines in Gotham City, but there doesn’t seem to be much need for sunscreen. The vibe of the city fits the darkness, with its crooked cops and deranged villains running amuck — just the kind of thing Batman wants to stop.\n\nThere are rumors of a vigilante who dresses like a bat, but most people dismiss them. Of course, there is a Batman, who is also Bruce Wayne, the super-rich playboy who gallivants around town when he’s not psychologically avenging the murder of his parents when he was a boy. (Unlike the many, many tellings of that story, here his parents' deaths are alluded to, not shown, but the effects on Bruce are just as devastating.)\n\nThe series makes some interesting changes in the characters we know. The Penguin, for instance, is a woman (Minnie Driver), whose purple top hat and tails and monocle are more for her cabaret act than a disguise.\n\nShe shows up in the first episode, engaged in a mob war with local crime boss Rupert Thorne (Cedric Yarbrough). This sets the stage for the recurring theme of the season, with overambitious district attorney Harvey Dent (Diedrich Bader) running for mayor, putting him in conflict, but maybe also in cahoots, with Thorne.\n\nWe meet familiar characters like Harley Quinn, but they're different\n\nThat’s interesting enough, and Bader’s voice acting as Dent and later as Two-Face carries some dramatic weight. But much as with “The X-Files,” while there is a through line to the season, the best episodes are the standalone ones, where we meet, and Batman pursues the odd criminals who populate Gotham, like Firebug (Tom Kenny, voice of SpongeBob Squarepants), Gentleman Ghost (Toby Stephens) and Clayface (Dan Donahue). They’re freaks and all the better villains for it. My favorite is probably Onomatopoeia (Reid Scott), whose name is hilariously appropriate.\n\nOf course, we also meet some of the better-known characters, though they’re tweaked a little, too. Barbara Gordon (Krystal Joy Brown), the daughter of Jim (Eric Morgan Stuart), the police commissioner, is a public defender. Catwoman (Christina Ricci) is an embittered divorcee. Harley Quinn (Jamie Chung) is a psychiatrist with no Joker in sight.\n\nWhich, by the way, leads to one of the more original ideas, though you wonder what took so long: Bruce Wayne actually goes to (court-ordered) therapy. The payoff isn’t as satisfying as you would hope, but it does make you long for at least a glimpse into what’s going on in that troubled mind of his. He is, of course, too reserved and guarded for much of that, but the idea is intriguing.\n\nSo is the series. It won’t make you forget any of the versions that have come before it, but why should it? The Batman franchise isn’t a zero-sum game so much as it is an evolving story, even when it’s one we’ve seen so many times.\n\nBatman movies ranked: One dark knight movie reigns supreme\n\nHow many episodes will 'Batman: Caped Crusader' have\n\nThere are 10 episodes of \"Batman: Caped Crusader.\"\n\nWhere to watch 'Batman: Caped Crusader'\n\nAll 10 episodes stream on Prime Video on Thursday, Aug. 1."
