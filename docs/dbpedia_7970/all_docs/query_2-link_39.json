Countless lives were lost and the chasm between East and West remained as fragile and precarious as ever.\n\nThe memory of the Crusades would live on in fantastical story-telling, becoming the stuff of legends with ferocious characters evoking an era of chivalry and bravery.\n\nToday, the word still has great significance, denoting a vigorous campaign for change (whatever form that takes).\n\nThe Crusades would have a defining impact not only on generations of men who fought, died and survived the battles but for later generations with no memory of such events. The Crusades are evocative of a mentality of us vs them, good vs bad and provokes in much the same way the feeling of resentment, righteousness and justification for violence which the modern world still grapples with today.\n\nJessica Brain is a freelance writer specialising in history.
