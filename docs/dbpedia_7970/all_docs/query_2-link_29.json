        "text": "Threatened by the growing and vibrant Islamic Empire between 1095 and 1291 CE, the Latin Christian Church based in Rome joined the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople to lead a series of religious wars known as the Crusades. Armies faced off in the Levant, home to many sites revered in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religions. There were nine Crusades to the Holy Land during this period, although most historians tend to highlight the first three or four because they were the most significant. As is typical in the study of wars, most scholars focus their attention on the actions of men in their roles as religious or political leaders and as soldiers. However, women took part in the Crusades in a variety of ways, including as leaders and even as soldiers. ​\n\n​\n\nThe Crusades\n\nIn theory, when Pope Urban II issued a call to arms for the First Crusade in 1095, no one expected women to make the trip. Church leaders appealed to women with wealth to fund expeditions and new military orders. By the Second Crusade, some male authorities actively discouraged women from participating, saying that women would hinder the armies on the campaign. However, as going on Crusade offered distinct spiritual benefits, the experience had to be available to any devout Christian. In this respect, the Crusades were a super-pilgrimage, and women had been taking part in pilgrimage for centuries in Europe. Noblewomen looked to their ancestors for inspiration and hoped to leave a legacy to their descendants. Furthermore, medieval society was thought to be represented by three orders: Those who pray, meaning the clergy; those who fight, meaning the nobility; and those who work, meaning everyone else. If being noble meant being willing to fight, then noblewomen had to have a place in that order.\n\n​\n\n​Dozens of women went on Crusades. Matilda of Tuscany never got to go on an official Crusade, but she paved the way for women who did. Matilda had a reputation for military leadership before the Crusades began. She had long been a loyal defender of Pope Gregory VII who had a conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor. Initially, church and civil law prohibited anyone but a secular male warrior from taking up arms. However, anyone could fight, and fighting monks emerged. Like many daughters of feudal lords, Matilda had been trained in strategy, even if she never personally wielded a weapon. Sources say she was a brilliant strategist and that she was passionate about defending holy causes. Matilda was prepared to lead forces against the Turks as early as 1074, when they defeated the Byzantine army at Manzikert. When the first Crusade was announced in 1095, Matilda was still wrangling with the Holy Roman Emperor and his supporters.\n\nMost of the crusaders traveling from Western Europe to the Holy Lands had to pass through the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Although she was only a child during the First Crusade, Anna Comnena’s historical account is the only source from a Byzantine perspective.\n\nAnna was the daughter of Emperor Alexios I Comnenos, and she wrote a history of his reign after she retired to a monastery in the 1140s. She based her history on eyewitness accounts from members of court and veterans, but she also had access to the Imperial archives. Her work, known as the Alexiad, describes the tension at court over the influx of heavily armed crusaders passing through Byzantine lands. She described both the Latins and the Turks as “barbarians.” She stated that her father did not trust the Turks very much even though he hoped the Franks and Latins would help keep his Empire intact.\n\nOne of the most famous women to go on Crusade is Eleanor of Aquitaine. She was the sole heiress to the territory of Aquitaine in southwestern France and was married to the French prince Louis when she was only thirteen or fourteen. In 1147, Eleanor and her husband, who was by then the king of France, together joined the Second Crusade. Louis knelt in the cathedral to “take the cross,” and inspire the faithful of France to join the fight. Eleanor then knelt beside him to take the cross in the name of Aquitaine and call on those loyal to her family. She also inspired numerous noblewomen to accompany their husbands and brothers. The entire entourage was said to be glorious.\n\nHowever, as the army slowly made its way down the coast towards Antioch, disaster struck. Torrential rains swept away equipment, men, and horses. The terrain was brutal, and supplies ran low. Worse yet, the vanguard under the leadership of Eleanor and two of her noble vassals set up camp farther ahead than Louis and the rest of the army expected them to. The army was unable to catch up before night fell. Turkish forces took advantage of the gap between Eleanor and Louis’ forces, attacking the exhausted army when Eleanor’s guard was too far away to send supplies. After that defeat, the royal couple and what was left of their army returned to the coast to find ships to carry on with the Crusade. They eventually arrived at Antioch, which at the time was ruled by Eleanor’s uncle. Relieved to be among familiar faces and customs, Eleanor seemed happy to settle in for a while, but Louis became jealous and impatient. He forced her to come to Jerusalem with her troops. She did but refused to participate any longer in the war. The Second Crusade ended in humiliation for Louis, and they had their marriage annulled not long after they returned to France. Eleanor’s reputation after the Crusade was a poor one, as many blamed her leadership for the loss.\n\nEleanor regained her lands and married the grandson of Henry I of England, Henry Plantagenet, count of Anjou and duke of Normandy. They had eight children all of whom would be entered into political marriages to secure peace and power. Eleanor earned the title “grandmother of Europe” as so many of her descendants ruled. Although they had many children, her new husband was not faithful to her. She instigated a revolt by her sons against her husband. The revolt failed and she was held in captivity until her husband died.\n\nEleanor’s son, Richard the Lionheart, became king, and Eleanor played a greater political role than ever before. When he led a Crusade to the Holy Land, she kept his kingdom running smoothly and defeated his brothers when they tried to take his crown. He was captured and Eleanor came to save him, collecting his ransom and personally returning him to England. Richard’s brother, John, succeeded him and almost all of his successes could be traced back to his mother. Other women described her as “beautiful and just, imposing and modest, humble and elegant… who surpassed almost all the queens of the world.”\n\nTombs of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II Plantagenet, flickr\n\nWomen Crusaders\n\nWhen it came to the crusades, did women actually participate in combat? It seems that some did. Christian male writers debated whether or not women should fight in the Crusades and very few of them broached the topic as it related to combat. One Greek historian from the First Crusade wrote of women among the warriors, noting that they rode on horseback “in the manner of men, not on coverlets side-saddle but unashamedly astride, and bearing lances and weapons as men do.” Islamic sources also confirmed that women were among the combatants. The twelfth century historians Imad ad-Din and Baha ad-Din reported that a noblewoman arrived by sea in 1189 with an escort of 500 knights. She led her army on raids against the Turkish camps. Both historians also wrote of women in armor, wielding weapons, who were not discovered until their armor was removed after death. Baha further commented on the women who would stand on the walls of the city, firing arrows down on their enemies. Perhaps the Christian writers had mixed feelings about women in combat and preferred to focus on their other activities while on Crusade.\n\nWomen, children, and men too old to fight accompanied the armies and sought to make themselves useful and worthy of the spiritual benefits that came with participation. They brought water and food to the warriors, offering encouragement and prayers.They dug ditches and cleared rubble. Albert of Aachen reported in 1099 that women helped weave the material needed to build a siege engine. There were also some prostitutes in the mix. But most women, whether Christian or Muslim-, were associated with the vital preparation of food, laundry, and care for the sick and wounded. During the Second Crusade, Louis of France relied on a woman named Hersenda who was identified in other sources as a medical practitioner in Paris. Much medical knowledge passed from Islamic practitioners to Christians, and European medicine expanded its range of knowledge. Trota of Salerno practiced medicine in the south of Italy in the twelfth century; she is often regarded as the first gynaecologist.\n\nFrom the male Christian point of view, women who ruled were as dangerous a proposition as were women who fought. This led to mixed and contradictory accounts of the women who helped stabilize the Latin States. Alice of Antioch, for example, gained a reputation as an evil and greedy usurper for trying to take over the principality of Antioch. Her husband of four years was killed in 1130 when their daughter, his heir, was only an infant. Alice had support among her vassals, but her father, Baldwin II of Jerusalem, wanted a male regent to run Antioch until the baby Constance grew up. He sent forces to remove Alice from power. She retreated to Latakia and Jabala, cities she had received as dowry upon her marriage. From there, Alice consolidated support and went on to make two more attempts to take over Antioch. During all this time, Alice created the tools of government, appointing a constable and other offices, setting up a scriptorium to handle her decrees and alliances, and establishing a clear court culture. It was all for nothing. Alice finally admitted defeat when Raymond of Poitiers arrived and was chosen as Constance’s consort. Once the heir had a male partner to cement her claim to the principality, all of Alice’s supporters shifted to what seemed like a more stable option.\n\n​At the end of the First Crusade, victorious Christian leaders claimed rulership of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and surrounding territories. We call these the Crusader States or the Latin States. These states were regularly involved in continued fighting as the Latins tried to claim more territory and the Islamic leaders sought to reclaim what they had lost. Many male leaders on both sides died in this ongoing conflict, and women became essential for stability in the region. Even leaders from kingdoms that had never recognized a woman’s claim to rule, such as France, supported the right of daughters to inherit their father’s titles. The frequent loss of male guardians also meant that women needed to serve regents and feudal lords. Finally, marital alliances created ties between people from the West and Christian leaders among the Greeks, Syrians, and other areas within the Levant. The existence of stable Latin states made pilgrimage to the Holy Land easier and encouraged even more women to make the journey.\n\n​Melisende of Jerusalem, Alice’s sister, had a different fate and much more support for her claim to Jerusalem. Baldwin II had married Melisende to Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Upon Baldwin’s death, Fulk and Melisende ascended to the throne. Together, they resisted one of Alice’s attempts on Antioch and it was Fulk who chose Raymond to marry Constance. However, at Melisende’s request, Fulk agreed to stay out of Alice’s affairs in the future.\n\n​In 1143, Fulk died and Melisende remained on the throne. It was under her leadership that the Crusader state of Edessa fell. She sent word to the pope and inspired the call that launched the Second Crusade. In 1150, Melisende had to fight her own son, Baldwin III, to hold onto Jerusalem. She used many of the same tactics Alice had tried, and ultimately settled for serving as a regent while Baldwin was still young or away on campaign. Unlike Alice, Melisende is remembered fondly in the chronicles because of her involvement in the Second Crusade."
