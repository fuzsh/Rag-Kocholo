        "text": "Synopsis\n\nWalpole presents The Castle of Otranto as the English translation of a recently discovered manuscript. The preface to the first edition suggests that the manuscript was written sometime between 1095 and 1243 (during the Crusades), “or not long afterwards,” and subsequently printed in Naples in 1529. The manuscript tells the story of Manfred, a prince of Otranto. At the beginning of the story, Manfred impatiently awaits the marriage of his sickly son, Conrad, to the princess Isabella. Manfred’s subjects note his impatience. They suspect that Manfred has arranged the marriage in the hope of avoiding an ancient prophecy that predicted his castle and his rulership of Otranto “should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz\n\nThe wedding date is set for Conrad’s birthday. On the day of the nuptials, however, Manfred’s son is nowhere to be found. In the courtyard a servant discovers that an enormous helmet has fallen from the sky and crushed Conrad to death. Upon realizing that his only male heir is dead and his wife can no longer bear children, Manfred decides to marry Isabella himself. He approaches Isabella with this proposition. When she refuses to marry him, Manfred seizes her, apparently intending to rape her. Fortunately, a series of supernatural events, including an appearance by the ghost of his grandfather, distract Manfred, and Isabella manages to wrestle free. As she makes her escape to the nearby church of St. Nicholas (with the help of a peasant named Theodore), Manfred is confronted by his guards, who claim to have seen a giant armoured leg in the gallery. Later he and his guards are joined by a group of knights seeking Isabella on behalf of her father, the Marquis of Vicenza.\n\nOutside the castle grounds, Theodore bravely defends Isabella from a knight. He wounds the knight and discovers—much to his dismay—that the wounded knight is actually Isabella’s father, Frederic. Together, Theodore, Frederic, and Isabella return to the castle. Frederic recovers and explains to Manfred’s wife, Hippolita, how exactly he came to be in Otranto: while away at war, Frederic had a vision warning him that his daughter was in danger. The vision directed him to a forest where he met a hermit. The hermit directed him to a gigantic sword inscribed with a prophecy:\n\nWhere’er a casque that suits this sword is found,\n\nWith perils is thy daughter compass’d round;\n\nAlfonso’s blood alone can save the maid,\n\nAnd quiet a long restless Prince’s shade.\n\nManfred, suddenly observing the resemblance between Theodore and the hero Alfonso, tries again to secure Isabella’s hand in marriage. This time he proposes to Frederic that they marry each other’s daughters. At first Frederic agrees, but he is haunted by the ghost of the hermit from the forest and ultimately decides not to go through with the double marriage.\n\nManfred is furious—and more so after he learns that Theodore is meeting a lady in Alfonso’s tomb. Manfred, convinced that Isabella is having an affair with Theodore, sneaks into the tomb and fatally stabs the lady. In horror, Manfred realizes that he has slain not Isabella but his own daughter, Matilda. Moments after Matilda’s death, the castle wall behind Manfred crumbles, revealing a gigantic vision of Alfonso. The image of Alfonso declares that his grandson, Theodore, is the true heir of Otranto. Manfred thereupon reveals that his grandfather poisoned Alfonso and usurped his throne. In an attempt to atone for his wrongdoing, Manfred agrees to abdicate the throne. The novel ends with Frederic offering Isabella’s hand in marriage to Theodore. Although he eventually agrees to marry Isabella, Theodore mourns the loss of his true love, Matilda, for many years.\n\nAnalysis and interpretation\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn The Castle of Otranto, Walpole combines ancient and modern literary motifs. Walpole draws fantastic and supernatural elements from the medieval romances of the 12th and 13th centuries and blends them with elements of contemporary realist fiction of the 18th century. As he explains in the preface to the second edition (1765) of his novel:\n\n[The Castle of Otranto] was an attempt to blend the two kinds of Romance, the ancient and the modern. In the former all was imagination and improbability: in the latter, nature is always intended to be, and sometimes has been, copied with success.\n\nWalpole maintains a pretense of reality in The Castle of Otranto. In the preface to the first edition, he establishes a plausible history for the manuscript, and he suggests that “the ground-work of the story is founded on truth.” He builds a realistic world populated by realistic characters and grounded on realistic premises. But, by introducing elements of the supernatural into this world, Walpole effectively bends reality. He reconciles the natural and the supernatural, in essence creating a new genre of fantasy: fantasy grounded in reality.\n\nIn many respects, The Castle of Otranto resembles Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Both works address questions of marriage, bloodlines, and familial bonds. The central issues in the works are the same: in each, a prince struggles to secure his lineage and maintain his power. The princes even experience similar supernatural phenomena: Hamlet is haunted by the ghost of his father and Manfred by the ghost of his grandfather. As in Hamlet, deception plays a central role in The Castle of Otranto, formally and thematically. In the preface to the second edition of his novel, Walpole acknowledged his indebtedness to Shakespeare. He praised Shakespeare as a literary genius and drew connections between his work and that of the playwright—perhaps hoping to elevate his work to the level of Shakespeare’s.\n\nPlace in the Gothic tradition\n\nWalpole was a pivotal figure in 18th-century England. He wore many hats in his lifetime: a member of Parliament, an English historian, an architect, and an author. Before The Castle of Otranto, Walpole published the biographical compendia Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–71), and he was considered an expert source on antiquarian artifacts and Gothic architecture. Walpole himself lived in a Gothic-style mansion. In 1747 he acquired a small villa in Twickenham, England, and subsequently transformed it into a grand estate featuring cloisters, turrets, and battlements. The estate, fondly called Strawberry Hill House (or simply Strawberry Hill), suggests in its atmosphere the setting of The Castle of Otranto. According to Walpole, The Castle of Otranto was in fact inspired by a nightmare he experienced at Strawberry Hill House. Walpole claimed he saw a ghost in the nightmare—specifically, a “gigantic hand in armour.” Walpole incorporated imagery from his dream into the novel, and he drew on his knowledge of medieval history to supplement the story.\n\nMany of Walpole’s plot devices and character types became typical of Gothic literature. Hidden identities, secret passageways, supernatural forces, and virginal damsels in distress all feature prominently in later Gothic novels. Indeed, The Castle of Otranto marked the beginning of a vogue for this type of novel. Despite mixed reactions from readers and critics, Walpole’s novel went into a second print run in April 1765, just a few months after its initial publication in late 1764. In 1765 Walpole added the subheading “A Gothic Story” to the title. The Castle of Otranto inspired a slew of imitators, including Matthew Gregory Lewis, whose seminal novel The Monk: A Romance (1796) was modeled on the formula of The Castle of Otranto. Walpole also likely influenced Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) as well as Jane Austen’s satirical take on the genre, Northanger Abbey (written c. 1798 or 1799, published 1817).\n\nHaley Bracken"
