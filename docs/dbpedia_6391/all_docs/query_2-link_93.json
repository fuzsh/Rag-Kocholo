        "text": "I was recently watching the movie “Us” by Jordan Peele, starring the famed actress Lupita Nyong’o. Like any Jordan Peele movie, the storyline left me in thought about the deeper meaning and symbolism portrayed.\n\nAfter a quick google search, I found, as suspected, its main theme to be about the haves vs. the haves not, about privilege, and inequality; the paradox between rich and poor. While Jordan Peele himself has left the interpretation of the film open to the public, it is quite clear that there are many hints alluding to this theme.\n\nSo what is this movie about? “Us” is a psychological thriller about a suburban family who goes on vacation and is confronted by a group of doppelgangers who are out to get them. The doppelgangers are revealed to be part of an elaborate tunnel system beneath the earth’s surface.\n\nThe symbolism revealed in this film reminded me of the non-fiction book “Outliers” by Malcom Gladwell, which touches on the notion that it is easy to fall prey to the belief that our successes are the result of individual actions and efforts. I think many of us, including myself, fall prey to this trap, while in reality it is rather complex, with our backgrounds, the families we have been born into, and mere luck playing a larger role than we think.\n\nLike Gladwell, Peele very well conveys the distorted view of success that results from a flawed system of inherent inequality.\n\nAfter watching Peele’s thriller, I was reminded of the obliviousness that comes with this distorted image of success; I catch myself in the trap of believing that my achievements have resulted from my own sole effort, adopting an almost egocentric view.\n\nAs portrayed in the movie “Us”, the reality is that there will be always be someone like us that could have made the same achievements were in not for their circumstances holding them back. Moreover, Peele conveys the concept of the outlier, someone who stands out; that 1%.\n\nIn this case, the outlier is depicted as the main character’s doppelganger, representing someone from an underprivileged background who manages to escape the tunnel system and replace her privileged counterpart’s life, against all odds.\n\nWhile in our society we highly admire outliers, Peele displays how in the process the outlier wears a mask to cover her true identity, has to step over others to achieve her success, and make significant sacrifices, reflecting the inherent flaws to our society, one where the person with privilege will always have the upper hand.\n\nThis idea is very well illustrated during a scene where both the main character and doppelganger give the same ballet recital, but the underprivileged doppelganger always ends up falling just short of their privileged counterpart\n\nTo conclude, I found “Us” to be an insightful and thought-provoking film. Have you seen this film? what were your thoughts?"
