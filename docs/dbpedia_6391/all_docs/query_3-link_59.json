        "text": "Yorgos Lanthimos never gives audiences an easy time, but The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a truly dark trip. It follows a cardiac surgeon (Colin Farrell) who introduces his family to a teenage boy (Barry Keoghan) with a connection to his past, but things start to fall apart once the true nature of their relationship and the ties that bind them come to light. For the director who has dabbled in surrealist arthouse and dark comedy period pieces, this is arguably his most unsettling film to date due to its eerie proximity to reality. netflix.com\n\nThe first rule of Fight Club is that you probably already know what happens in it but you need to see it nonetheless. Like The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, the film’s twist ending has become film folklore, but that’s not all it has to offer. We follow an insomniac (Edward Norton) who, after becoming disillusioned by capitalism, forms an underground fight club with Tyler, a soap salesman played by Brad Pitt. Soon, their venture starts to spiral into something bigger and beyond them. If you don't already know where this is going, the less said the better. disneyplus.com\n\nIs anything better than Jake Gyllenhaal in one of his creepy little weirdo eras? Velvet Buzzsaw takes the psychological thriller into the black comedy realm as it dumps us in the pretentious contemporary art scene of LA. The film revolves around a gallerist, and the crowd of sycophants around her, who decides to build a show around the work of a recently deceased, unknown artist. Soon, everyone in her orbit is plucked off one by one in increasingly horrifying ways. A satire of commercial greed, Velvet Buzzsaw is deliciously dark and deeply weird in the best way. netflix.com\n\nPossibly the most famous psychological thriller in cinema history, and one that’s still being debated today thanks to Kubrick's commitment to obscurity, The Shining is an icon in its own tier. In it, elastic-faced Jack Nicholson, hired to tend an abandoned ski resort in its off-season, unravels inch by inch. Nicholson’s Jack descends into madness as the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel come out to keep him company. Or, are they all in his head? Rent on amazon.co.uk\n\nParasite winning Best Picture was a rare, surprise moment of joy at the Oscars back in 2020. If you somehow missed out on the groundswell of hype that this South Korean film got in the run-up to its historic win, now is the time to watch it. It’s a thriller quite unlike anything else, following the interweaving lives of the haves and have-nots that hinge upon each other precariously. A poor family infiltrates the working staff of a rich household, slowly inserting themselves into every position available within the home. However, they don’t realise there’s something lurking within the walls that could upend their meal ticket. Rent on amazon.co.uk\n\nThe gripping format of watching a crime being solved is why there are roughly 876 procedurals on television on any given night, and partly why Fracture is so compelling. Anthony Hopkins teams up with a then-young buck Ryan Gosling, a mastermind criminal and the attorney trying to prosecute him respectively. Thinking he has an open and shut case after Hopkins admits to shooting his wife for having an affair, Gosling is taken through the wringer as he realises what seemed like a simple guilty verdict is not as it seems. amazon.co.uk\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola had a pretty good run in the 1970s. Of course, the heavy hitters like The Godfather and Apocolypse Now get the much-deserved glory, but he also had the chance to knock out this gem of a psychological thriller about a man growing increasingly paranoid while surveilling a couple. It’s the blueprint of any solid thriller: a person, emboldened by their own perception of things, is stirred into a frenzy when the rest of the world doesn’t seem to see what they do. The Conversation revolves around a murder, but which murder? amazon.co.uk\n\nIn an attempt to spice up their sex life, married couple Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) invest in a pair of sturdy steel handcuffs. Chained to the bed, Jessie's arousal soon turns to panic as her husband dies from a sudden and unexpected heart attack. What's more, there are no neighbours for miles, the handcuffs are too strong to break and the phone is just out of reach. Far more than just a sex game gone wrong, this suspense-driven Stephen King adaptation, from Haunting of Hill House director Mike Flanagan, tests the viewer's psychological endurance almost as much as Jessie's, who, at one point, must helplessly watch a dog begin to eat her husband while she remains unable to move. netflix.com\n\nIf you ever suffering from gifting anxiety, just know nothing can ever be as bad as what Michael Douglas has to endure in The Game. The film tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious present by his brother - the chance to participate in a strange, immersive game that quickly turns nightmarish. The '90s were full of these high-concept, elaborate mind-bending thrillers, and The Game is a slightly silly but nostalgic ride that will make you feel tense until the end credits. netflix.com\n\nAnother one to file under the black comedy tab of the psychological thriller genre, The Menu hides some of its more mind-melting motives under razor-sharp dialogue and some truly see-them-to-believe-them set pieces. It follows a young couple, played by Nicholas Hoult and Anya Taylor-Joy, who travel to a remote island to eat at an exclusive restaurant fronted by an eccentric chef with a lavish menu. Fine dining has never looked messier. disneyplus.com\n\nAfter a run as a hugely successful and deeply unsettling stage show, The Woman in Black took its ghostly horror to the big screen. Post-Potter Daniel Radcliffe plays a young widower who, after arriving in a remote village, discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is hellbent on terrorising the locals. This really does turn the dial close to the horror end of the thriller spectrum, but it’s a fantastic example of less is more when it comes to bone-chilling spooks and scares. disneyplus.com\n\nWhen you think of David Lynch, it’s probably best to assume your mind is going to get twisted; conventional isn’t really his thing. Blue Velvet is a classic of his portfolio, a rich and delicious noir thriller that has divided and enraptured audiences since its release in 1986. Starring Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini and Laura Dern, it follows a young college student who, after returning home to visit his ill father, discovers a severed human ear in a field. A mass conspiracy then unfolds in front of him as he strikes up a romance with a troubled singer. You’ll leave feeling bemused, flummoxed, frustrated, and a little bit nauseous, just as Lynch intended. amazon.co.uk\n\nThe modern-day classic when it comes to psychological thrillers, Shutter Island is a masterpiece of the genre, twisting and turning until the very end. Headed up by Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, and directed by Martin Scorsese, this neo-noir follows a U.S. Marshal investigating a psychiatric facility on a secluded island after one of the patients goes missing. Things could not be less as they seem, however, as the unsettling vibe of an island full of the criminally insane starts to interweave with the trauma of DiCaprio’s character. It probably contains one of the most satisfying and brain-melting twists in film history, but the ride to get there is also a big thrill. netflix.com\n\nNotes on a Scandal, may look like a muted domestic drama, but its power is in showing that the most unsettling tension can be found in unexpected places. Judi Dench plays a lonely history teacher who latches on to a new, younger recruit at the school, played by Cate Blanchett. But when she discovers that the new object of her obsession is having an affair with a 15-year-old student, she uses it as blackmail to stay close to her. As tension builds, our loyalties to characters are tested as each one reveals to have an ugly side with a different breaking point. disneyplus.com"
