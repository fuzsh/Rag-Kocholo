        "text": "It was supposed to be the year horror finally got some respect.\n\nWhile 2017 brought some stylish small films (“It Comes at Night,” “Raw”) and a megablockbuster (“It”), the real reason for optimism was “Get Out,” Jordan Peele’s trenchant indictment of liberal white orthodoxy told in the language of a paranoid gothic nightmare. Critics rightly received it as a weighty work of art, and it became the kind of prestige film that gets talked about during awards season, especially in the lead-up to the Oscar nominations coming on Jan. 23.\n\nBut when it was recently nominated for a Golden Globe, it landed in the comedy and musical category, and Mr. Peele weighed into the ensuing controversy with concerns that the comedy label trivialized the subject matter. At the same time, Mr. Peele didn’t insist on it’s being labeled horror, either. He said “Get Out” doesn’t fit into a genre, and described it as a “social thriller.” (It still didn’t win anything at the Golden Globes.)\n\nHe isn’t the only one distancing the movie from the horror genre. At the National Board of Review gala this month, the screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher presented Mr. Peele with an award after saying that if “Get Out” is a horror film, “Jaws” is a “beach movie.”\n\nTo an unapologetic lover of horror, the attempt to push “Get Out,” a movie with body snatching, jump scares and plenty of blood, out of the genre stings, in part because it’s so familiar. Arguing over the definition of a genre, I should stipulate, is only slightly sillier than fighting over what movie should win an award, which doesn’t mean that I haven’t spent considerable stretches of my life doing both. But how we describe movies does matter, telegraphing value judgments and informing their context.\n\nThere’s a long history of movies being too good to be considered horror. Brian De Palma said he never thought of “Carrie,” his movie based on Stephen King’s novel, as horror, and William Friedkin has also rejected that label for “The Exorcist.” In his review of “Jaws,” Roger Ebert called it an “adventure movie,” while The New York Times’s Vincent Canby described it as “science fiction.” When “Rosemary’s Baby,” an inspiration for “Get Out,” premiered, the Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin panned it as “sick and obscene,” before adding bluntly in a subsequent essay that it was “too well done” for a horror movie.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
