        "text": "01 of 24\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\nMeet the carefully curated facade of Patrick Bateman — a man who not only slays a morning skincare routine but also, well, slays. Adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' controversial 1991 novel, American Psycho follows Bateman as he leads a double life, hobnobbing with his narcissistic co-workers as a slick N.Y.C. investment banker while moonlighting as a serial killer.\n\nThis satirical horror brilliantly dissects the soulless '80s capitalist culture, where materialism reigns supreme and vanity is a virtue, while Christian Bale conjures a monumental character study with his mordant and monstrous Bateman. EW's critic writes, \"Funny, pungent, and weirdly gripping, American Psycho is a satire that feels like a hallucination\" draped in a \"tone of rambunctious, light-fingered malevolence.\" —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch American Psycho: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mary Harron\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Chloë Sevigny, Samantha Mathis, Cara Seymour, Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon\n\n02 of 24\n\nAnon (2018)\n\nPrivacy and anonymity are luxuries afforded to no one in the 2018 British-American sci-fi thriller Anon. Clive Owen stars as Det. Sal Frieland, a troubled cop operating in a dystopia where the entire populace is implanted with an ocular device intended to record and track the movements of the people around them. The government's transparency methods ensure that all criminal activity is caught on tape — but when a mysterious woman with no digital footprint (Amanda Seyfried) crosses paths with Sal, he realizes she might have a connection with a series of unsolved murders he's investigating.\n\nDirector Andrew Niccol tells EW, \"I always wanted to do a movie about privacy and the fact that there was never a war for privacy because we already lost — we gave away our privacy without a fight, all for convenience.\" —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Anon: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Andrew Niccol\n\nCast: Clive Owen, Amanda Seyfried, Colm Feore, Mark O'Brien\n\n03 of 24\n\nA Simple Favor (2018)\n\nThere’s nothing simple about the plot to A Simple Favor, a thriller about a mommy blogger’s (Anna Kendrick) quest to find her friend Emily (Blake Lively) who disappears under mysterious circumstances. A romantic thriller with a fair amount of dark comedy thrown in courtesy of director Paul Feig, A Simple Favor benefits from excellent performances, Hitchcockian vibes, and a duplicitous tension that carries the audience through the film’s many zig and zags — even the ones that fail to pay off.\n\nAs EW’s critic writes, the movie is “full of panache, from its sexy French score to its glistening gin martinis, and it weaponizes style, using it to keep audiences off balance as the mystery unfolds.” Enjoy A Simple Favor, and keep an eye out for the sequel, which was greenlit in March of 2024. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch A Simple Favor: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Feig\n\nCast: Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding, Andrew Rannells, Linda Cardellini, Rupert Friend, Jean Smart\n\n04 of 24\n\nBird Box (2018)\n\nSight becomes a handicap in Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller where the enemy must go unseen, or else. Sandra Bullock stars as Malorie Hayes, a woman responsible for transporting two young children down a river while wearing blindfolds, a strategy intended to help the survivors avoid seeing the entities that attacked Earth five years earlier, and who cause those who look upon them to commit suicide.\n\nJumping between their present journey and the past events that led Malorie and the children to this point, director Susanne Bier leans into the tension of the unknown and relies on her talented but eclectic cast to do the rest. Released the same year as A Quiet Place, and possessing a somewhat similar premise, Bird Box received less attention when it first premiered, but this sci-fi horror film is a great option for fans of both genres. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Bird Box: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Susanne Bier\n\nCast: Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes, John Malkovich, Danielle Macdonald, Sarah Paulson\n\n05 of 24\n\nCaptain Phillips (2013)\n\nInspired by the Maersk Alabama hijacking incident in 2009 where four Somali pirates seized a U.S. cargo ship sailing through the Indian Ocean, Captain Phillips features the expected tour de force performance from Tom Hanks, while also debuting an astonishing new face, and staying true to the story on which the film is based. Hanks takes on the role of Capt. Richard Phillips, a man who squares off with pirates armed only with his thick Massachusetts accent. Meanwhile newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who plays the desperate pirate leading the raid on Phillips' ship, balances violence with vulnerability in an Oscar-nominated turn.\n\nThe kind of film where you find yourself rooting for the heroes while still empathizing with the villains, Captain Phillips' performances and script are tough enough to navigate the most dangerous waters. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Captain Phillips: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Greengrass\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Catherine Keener, Barkhad Abdi\n\n06 of 24\n\nThe Devil All the Time (2020)\n\nA Netflix original and period thriller, The Devil All the Time explores several interconnected groups of people living in two small towns in Southern Ohio between the end of World War II and the mid-1960s. Linked by religious evangelism, war, corruption, suicide, abandonment, and serial murder, the cast — which includes a host of young Hollywood heavy hitters — makes the most of the story's melodrama and dark subject matter.\n\nBased on the 2011 novel and directed by Antonio Campos (The Staircase), The Devil All the Time takes the \"all the time\" portion of the film's title literally: the sins are multitudinous and the depths of human depravity on full display. Still, EW's critic writes that Campos' biggest accomplishment as the film's director is \"toeing a tricky line between art-house atmosphere and Southern Gothic soap opera, and somehow still managing to land on the grim side of fascinating.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Devil All the Time: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Antonio Campos\n\nCast: Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Riley Keough, Eliza Scanlen, Haley Bennett, Bill Skarsgård, Mia Wasikowska, Jason Clarke\n\n07 of 24\n\nEl Camino (2019)\n\nThe best meth cook in Albuquerque is back, bitch. Breaking Bad's Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) return for El Camino, a film based on AMC's beloved show, with far more attention paid to Pinkman's character. Freewheeling through time and flashing back to events depicted in the series, El Camino picks up right where Breaking Bad left off, and includes a host of cameos from the show's five-season run.\n\nJane, Skinny Pete, and Badger are all back in one form or another, but it's Nazi Todd (Jesse Plemons) who informs most of the film's plot. Breaking Bad fans will be gratified to see Jesse Pinkman finally get the time to mentally process the last couple years of his life — even if Paul looks markedly older than he did when the show wrapped in 2013. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch El Camino: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Vince Gilligan\n\nCast: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Jonathan Banks, Matt Jones\n\n08 of 24\n\nEmily the Criminal (2022)\n\nDrowning in debt and student loans, Emily is one of Los Angeles' many broke artists on the verge of financial ruin. With a former felony conviction preventing her from finding a job that might pay enough to survive, Emily finds purpose — and quick cash — by getting involved with a credit card fraud ring. What starts as a survival tactic soon balloons into much more, as Emily distances herself from the corporate world she can never quite crack and leans into the world of criminality.\n\nAubrey Plaza is in her element here, her blunt practicality and signature deadpan delivery serving as the perfect stand-in for an audience whose dreams of hitting milestones like home ownership and retirement have been deadened by current economic realities. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Emily the Criminal: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nCast: Aubrey Plaza, Theo Rossi, Bernardo Badillo, John Billingsley\n\n09 of 24\n\nFair Play (2023)\n\nFor newly engaged couple Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) and Emily (Phoebe Dynevor), their sizzling, can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other love must remain discreet within their workplace. However, when Emily secures a managerial position at their dog-eat-dog hedge fund, the power shift within the bullpen begins to splinter their romantic bliss.\n\nPraising its \"lean, crackling script,\" EW's critic observes how Fair Play's final act is \"so freighted with increasingly unhinged possibilities\" yet \"both leads hang on, throwing themselves headlong into the tar pits of contemporary workplace politics and gender roles without being drawn into clumsy, one-dimensional ideas of victimhood or villainy.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Fair Play: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Chloe Domont\n\nCast: Phoebe Dynevor, Alden Ehrenreich, Eddie Marsan, Rich Sommer\n\n10 of 24\n\nThe Gift (2015)\n\nNot to be confused with Sam Raimi's 2000 fortune teller movie, Joel Edgerton's directorial debut (which he also wrote and starred in) starts out like a typical stalker thriller. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play Simon and Robyn, a married couple who move from Chicago to California, where they run into Simon's old high school classmate Gordo (Edgerton). Gordo soon becomes clingy, with frequent unexpected drop-ins, and floods the couple with a series of unsettling gifts. When Simon tries to cut the relationship off, the trouble starts in earnest.\n\nAs EW's critic colorfully describes, The Gift \"effectively sees what other films in the genre do for their scares, shakes its head, and says, 'No, no, no. I'll show you messed up.'\" But The Gift transcends the usual stalker movie tropes because it's not content to stack all the blame on the obvious heavy. Instead, it expands on the concepts of villain and victim, exploring how difficult it is sometimes to keep the past in the past. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Gift: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Joel Edgerton\n\nCast: Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Tim Griffin, Allison Tolman, Katie Aselton, Wendell Pierce, Beau Knapp, Adam Lazarre-White, David Denman, P.J. Byrne, Busy Philipps\n\n11 of 24\n\nThe Good Nurse (2022)\n\nNurses are angels with the power to do the work of demons. In the Netflix original psychological thriller The Good Nurse, Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) is a night nurse with a work husband: Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne). A single mom with a serious heart condition, Amy is shocked to learn that the recent death of one of their hospital's patients is thought to have occurred intentionally, and that Charles might be involved. And the more Amy digs, the more she realizes the co-worker she trusts is actually someone far more nefarious.\n\nBased on the true story of how the real-life Amy Loughren helped authorities take down serial killer Charles Cullen, The Good Nurse is good old-fashioned, ripped-from-the-headlines cinema with a story made all the more terrifying because so little of it is exaggerated. Trust us — you've never seen Eddie Redmayne like this before. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Nurse: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Tobias Lindholm\n\nCast: Jessica Chastain, Eddie Redmayne\n\n12 of 24\n\nI Care A Lot (2021)\n\nRosamund Pike builds on her Gone Girl villainess status to portray Marla Grayson, a con artist who fronts as a professional \"legal guardian\" to fleece the elderly of their life savings. But Marla takes it a step too far when she meets Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest), who seems infirm at first but actually has ties to important, dangerous people (like Peter Dinklage) who Marla would do well to stay clear of. Pike's duplicitous performance is a blast to witness, but seeing Marla meet her match is just as gratifying. As EW's writes in their review, \"There's good fun in I Care a Lot's setup, and in Marla's ruthless M.O.\" —Gwen Ihnat\n\nWhere to watch I Care a Lot: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: J Blakeson\n\nCast: Rosamund Pike, Dianne Wiest, Peter Dinklage, Eiza González, Chris Messina, Isiah Whitlock Jr.\n\n13 of 24\n\nI Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore (2017)\n\nAfter Yellowjackets, Togetherness, and Mrs. America, we'd straight-up watch Melanie Lynskey in anything, but even we missed Macon Blair's 2017 sleeper. Lynskey plays Ruth, a down-on-her-luck nursing assistant who decides after her house gets broken into that she's fed up. She hooks up with her odd neighbor Tony (Elijah Wood) to go out on a quest to get her stuff back, leading to a quirky journey that's both suspenseful and inspiring for the downtrodden.\n\nSecond only to Lynskey in luminescence in this movie is Wood, whose Tony named his dog Kevin and specializes in nunchucks and ninja stars. And Jane Levy is unrecognizable as one of the unsavory thieves. As EW's critic points out, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival for its reconfiguration of \"the buddy-cop film — at one point, Ruth even flashes a toy police badge.\" —G.I.\n\nWhere to watch I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Macon Blair\n\nCast: Melanie Lynskey, Elijah Wood, Jane Levy\n\n14 of 24\n\nThe Little Things (2021)\n\nThe Little Things spent more than 25 years in development hell before finally making its way into production in 2019. And while the film may have cycled through several different directors in its early years (including Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood), the story never deviated from the ‘90s time period during which it was written and set.\n\nGenre lovers who value conclusive endings and mysteries tied up in neat little bows may find themselves disappointed by The Little Things’ climax — or lack thereof. But thriller fans who can appreciate obsessive detectives, a slow burn plot, and a trio of strong actors — Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, Jared Leto — who know how to bounce off each other and play up the story’s intensity, will find much to enjoy in this suspenseful thriller. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Little Things: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Lee Hancock\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, Jared Leto, Natalie Morales\n\n15 of 24\n\nLou (2022)\n\nAllison Janney knows how to deliver a line, and thanks to stunt training for her new Netflix film, Lou, she also knows how to deliver a punch. Janney stars as the film's titular character, a misandrist landlord who rents a home to a single mother named Hannah (Jurnee Smollett) and her young daughter, Vee. After Vee is kidnapped, Lou agrees to help Hannah bring her back, but saving Vee's future will require Lou to confront her own messy past.\n\nDirector Anna Foerster asked a lot of her cast during production, as evidenced by the fact that both Smollett and Janney spend much of the film covered in mud. (Smollett tells EW, \"The mud is a character in itself!\") As for Janney, she hopes this role will showcase her rarely-seen physical abilities — and maybe land her a role in the next John Wick movie. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Lou: Netflix\n\nDirector: Anna Foerster\n\nCast: Allison Janney, Jurnee Smollett, Logan Marshall-Green\n\n16 of 24\n\nMissing (2023)\n\nOne might have suspected that the novelty of \"screenlife\" thrillers had run its course after Searching (2018), but Will Merrick and Nick Johnson exalted the genre with its standalone sequel, Missing: a story about a teenager (Storm Reid) investigating her mother's (Nia Long) disappearance in Colombia via all her digital resources. While the film's logic sometimes flirts with absurdity, the infinite pathways of the internet prove to be an imaginative tool for peeling back the mystery's myriad layers.\n\nGlowing with a sharp and witty portrayal of 2023's techno-centric culture, Missing grounds itself with a heartfelt journey of repairing a strained mother-daughter relationship. (And when the credits roll, you might want to reconsider using the same password for everything!) —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Missing: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Will Merrick, Nick Johnson\n\nCast: Storm Reid, Joaquim de Almeida, Ken Leung, Amy Landecker, Daniel Henney, Nia Long\n\n17 of 24\n\nNatural Born Killers (1994)\n\n\"Oliver Stone's vision has changed the way we saw our past. Now he takes a look at where we are and where we’re going.” So begins the official trailer for Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone’s 11th — and arguably most evocative — movie. Starring Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as Mickey and Mallory Knox, feral lovers with a fetish for murder, Killers follows as the couple’s homicidal rampage is broadcast nationally, transforming the Knoxes into overnight celebrities.\n\nOffered up by Stone as a satirical jab at a culture overstimulated by media and underwhelmed by empathy, Killers remains one of the most polarizing films around. If you can stomach the gore, Natural Born Killers is worth a watch, if only to see Stone’s masterful filmmaking at work. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Natural Born Killers: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Oliver Stone\n\nCast: Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Sizemore\n\n18 of 24\n\nThe Novice (2021)\n\nThe obsession with perfection crosses the line from competitive to dangerous in Lauren Hadaway’s directorial debut, The Novice. Orphan’s Isabelle Fuhrman stars as a compulsive college student who is determined to make her school’s varsity rowing team at all costs. Fuhrman gives a virtuoso performance as Alex, a queer first-year student whose addiction to being the best torpedoes her mental and physical health, her academic performance, and her social and romantic life.\n\nAnyone who has ever met a self-destructive, Type A teenager will recognize the anxious thrill that comes with watching someone who can’t relax work themselves into a terrifying state, and The Novice transforms that feeling into a thriller with aplomb. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Novice: Netflix\n\nDirector: Lauren Hadaway\n\nCast: Isabelle Fuhrman, Amy Forsyth, Dilone, Charlotte Ubben, Jonathan Cherry, Kate Drummond\n\n19 of 24\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\nSouth Korea’s Oldboy — not to be confused with the American version directed by Spike Lee — is considered one of the greatest films ever made, and since its release more than two decades ago, the movie’s fight sequences have challenged action directors and stunt coordinators to up their game. Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) is a businessman who has spent 15 years in captivity with no idea of who his kidnapper is or what they want with him. After his release, he wants vengeance — but he only has five days to hunt down his captor.\n\nBeloved for its memorable plot twist, hallway fight scene, and terrifying use of a living octopus, the film is beyond memorable. At the time of its release in 2003, EW’s critic writes, “Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It’s an onslaught made to cause a sensation.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Oldboy: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\n\nCast: Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae, Kang Hye-jung\n\n20 of 24\n\nOxygen (2021)\n\nA nightmare come to life for claustrophobics everywhere, Oxygen is a French language sci-fi film that thinks outside the box in terms of action. At the genesis, an unidentified woman (Mélanie Laurent) awakens in an airtight medical unit, unsure of who or where she is. Interactions with the system's AI — dubbed M.I.L.O. (Medical Interface Liaison Officer) — provide some clarity as to her identity, but no matter what she tries, she cannot escape her prison.\n\nAs she seeks to understand who placed her in the box and why, truths about her personal life and the current state of the world come into focus — but her search for context is actually a race to outwit the slowly depleting oxygen levels. Laurent is excellent, and despite being forced to perform on her back, she manages to imbue the film with a strong sense of determination and humanity. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Oxygen: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Alexandre Aja\n\nCast: Mélanie Laurent, Mathieu Amalric, Malik Zidi\n\n21 of 24\n\nSociety of the Snow (2023)\n\nIn 1972, the Andes Mountains became a crucible of survival when a Uruguayan flight crashed en route to Santiago, Chile. Sixteen remaining passengers found themselves stranded in one of Mother Nature's most life-threatening terrains, pushing them to take ineffable means to find their way back. While Hollywood attempted to soften this tragedy with a more glossy depiction in Alive (1993), Society of the Snow delivers a far more raw and emotive experience — enriched by the director's conversations with the real-life survivors — that sinks viewers into the gut-wrenching terror of the situation without being overly insensitive.\n\n\"A story that is based on humanism,\" J.A. Bayona (the director who also helmed another intense disaster film, 2012's The Impossible) describes the story as \"more about emotional survival. It's not only physical survival. It's to understand that there's something bigger than yourself.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Society of the Snow: Netflix\n\nDirector: J.A. Bayona\n\nCast: Enzo Vogrincic, Matías Recalt, Agustín Pardella, Felipe González Otaño, Luciano Chatton, Valentino Alonso, Francisco Romero, Agustín Berruti, Andy Pruss, Simón Hempe, Juan Caruso, Esteban Bigliardi, Rocco Posca, Esteban Kukuriczka, Rafael Federman, Manuela Olivera, Agustín Della Corte, Tomas Wolf\n\n22 of 24\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone (2023)\n\nA single genre isn't enough to contain one of Netflix's 2023 releases, They Cloned Tyrone. A sci-fi comedy that combines '70s Blaxploitation with mystery and social satire, the film has similar vibes to movies like Get Out (2017) or Sorry to Bother You (2018) while employing a far more absurd premise. Fontaine (John Boyega) is a drug dealer living in an impoverished area called the Glen. While trying to collect funds owed to him by a local pimp named Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx), Fontaine is shot and killed — but that doesn't stop him from showing up on Slick's doorstep the next day to collect his money.\n\nJoined by a sex worker named YoYo (Teyonah Parris), the trio attempts to get to the bottom of what appears to be a massive government conspiracy aimed at exploiting their disenfranchised community as medical subjects. A satirical romp that has as much to say about class and racial injustices as it does about mystery movie tropes, They Cloned Tyrone is smart, silly, and uniformly well-acted. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch They Cloned Tyrone: Netflix\n\nDirector: Juel Taylor\n\nCast: John Boyega, Teyonah Parris, Jamie Foxx\n\n23 of 24\n\nThe Weekend Away (2022)\n\nLeighton Meester stars in this murky mystery as Beth, a married new mom who goes off to visit her more glamorous friend Kate (Christina Wolfe) in a palatial apartment in Croatia. But when Kate disappears, Beth runs into one dead end after another trying to find her, until she eventually becomes a suspect in her friend's disappearance herself. The gripping whodunnit is only augmented by the idyllic seaside backdrop, which may make you long for a (less-eventful) weekend in the Balkan region yourself. —G.I.\n\nWhere to watch The Weekend Away: Netflix\n\nDirector: Kim Farrant\n\nCast: Leighton Meester, Christina Wolfe, Ziad Bakri\n\n24 of 24\n\nWild Things (1998)\n\nA late-‘90s mystery thriller with more twists and turns than a NASCAR racetrack, it’s easy to see where Wild Things starts and much harder to predict where the film is headed. Set in an upscale, fictional South Florida town, the film focuses on two high school girls (Neve Campbell and Denise Richards) who accuse their guidance counselor (Matt Dillon) of rape. As the trial and police investigation — led by Kevin Bacon — unfold, the question of who is working together and who is sleeping together becomes much harder to answer.\n\nScandalous, violent, and sexually progressive for its time, Wild Things pairs all the high school drama of Beverly Hills, 90210 with the duplicitousness of Gone Girl, and comes out with a pulpy, daring thriller. Full of beautiful people, luxurious shots, and lurid, murderous moments, Wild Things is like a car crash: You might not love every moment, but you certainly can’t look away. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Wild Things: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: John McNaughton\n\nCast: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Denise Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Robert Wagner, Bill Murray"
