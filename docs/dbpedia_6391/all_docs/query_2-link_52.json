        "text": "I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Get Out is one of the best movies released in the past decade. If you think otherwise, try giving it another watch (promise). As Jordan Peele's directing debut film, it opened up the gates for a genre that goes beyond the typical jump scares, monsters, and serial killers. I mean, if you ask me, surreal horror is just as scary if not MORE scary than any Freddy Krueger or Jason. Instead of men in masks and supernatural forces, the real villains look just like us.\n\nBefore we get into the list of movies, I think it's important to lay the groundwork for those of you who may have not seen Get Out yet (plz, exit and go !). Here's the rundown: Chris and his gf, Rose, have reached a major milestone in their relationship—meeting her parents. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of disturbing discoveries leads him to a truth he could have never imagined.\n\nSo, if you're a fan like me, I compiled a list of all the best movies like Get Out that cover similar topics and give the same heebie jeebie vibes. Think Black-led horror films, twists and turns, utopian environments becoming absolute nightmares, social commentary regarding race and sex, and little dashes of humor. So, if that piques your interest, let's get right into the list. Shall we?\n\nNope\n\nWe can't possibly start this list without Jordan Peele's latest horror movie masterpiece, also starring Daniel Kaluuya (yes, just like Get Out) and Keke Palmer. Filled with social commentary about exploitation, a brother and sister duo discover something sinister is living in the sky above their California horse ranch.\n\nUs\n\nYep, this is yet another cinematic stunner full of unexpected twists from the mind of Jordan Peele, where a family returns to their mom's beachfront hometown. Soon, the family's worst fears become a reality when four masked strangers descend upon their vacay and force them into a fight for survival.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nGet ready to reconsider everything you think you know. In this recent Netflix film, petty criminals unwittingly stumble upon an eerie government conspiracy taking place in their predominantly black neighborhood. They soon realize it's up to them and the rest of their community to stop it.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nThe Menu\n\nComedy, horror, and the media's current obsession with fine dining (thanks, The Bear) combine in this film full of twists and turns. Starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Fiennes, a young couple visits an exclusive destination restaurant on a remote island where the acclaimed chef has prepared a...lavish menu.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nReady or Not\n\nSimilar to Get Out, it's important to know exactly what you're getting into before you visit your significant other's family. After happily marrying the man of her dreams, a newlywed woman's in-laws force her into a deadly game of cat and mouse as she tries desperately to survive the night.\n\nAntebellum\n\nThis psychological thriller has plenty to say when it comes to this country's history of racism and discrimination. When an author suddenly wakes up to find herself enslaved on a plantation, she plunges into a horrifying reality that forces her to confront her past, present, and future before it's too late.\n\nCandyman\n\nWritten by none other than (you guessed it!), Jordan Peele, this remake of the 1992 film revisits the tale of the infamous hook-handed killer who preys on the housing projects of Chicago. But this time an artist begins to explore the macabre history of the legend of Candyman, not knowing it would unravel his sanity and unleash a wave of violence.\n\nBad Hair\n\nLike Get Out, Bad Hair is full of social commentary, except this film tackles the topic of beauty standards thrust upon Black women. Set in the 80s , the movie follows an ambitious young woman who gets a weave to succeed in the image-obsessed world of music television. However, her career may come at a greater cost when she realizes her new hair has a mind of its own.\n\nParasite\n\nIn this Oscar-winning film, greed, stark class differences, and inequality threaten the newly formed symbiotic relationship between the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kim clan.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nDon't Worry Darling\n\nSet in an idyllic community in the 1950s, this perfect town is not all sunshine and rainbows. While the husbands toil away, the wives get to enjoy the beauty and luxury of a seemingly perfect paradise. However, when cracks in their reality begin to appear, it exposes something much more sinister lurking beneath the surface.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nThe Stepford Wives\n\nBefore there was Don't Worry Darling, there was The Stepford Wives. Starring Nicole Kidman, a woman relocates to a Connecticut suburb, where she struggles to adjust to the town and the overly accommodating attitude of its local women. While her husband quickly warms up to their new location, she soon suspects something isn't right about the picture-perfect town.\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner\n\nReportedly a source of inspiration for Get Out, this 1967 film tackles the subject of interracial dating and what it's really like to bring someone you love home just to be met by the shock of your parents. Starring Sidney Poitier, a woman brings her Black fiancé to meet her wealthy parents, who are forced to confront their racism.\n\nSorry to Bother You\n\nFilled with dark humor and a look at a Black man's attempt to fit into a society that has often swept them to the side, telemarketer Cassius Green finds himself in an alternate reality after discovering a magical key that allows his career to take off, but soon he falls under the spell of a CEO who offers a salary beyond his wildest dreams.\n\nThe Shining\n\nSometimes it be your own family! Like Get Out, the person you thought you could trust the most can quickly turn against you. In this adaption of the Stephen King novel, a writer who moves his family to an isolated hotel in Colorado is driven into madness, and the hotel's dark secrets begin to unravel a homicidal maniac hell-bent on terrorizing his family.\n\nMidsommar\n\nAlthough this film doesn't tackle the issue of racism and discrimination, it gives the same eerie vibe that Get Out does when you realize what you thought was something good is actually leading to your demise. When a couple travels to Sweden to visit a midsummer festival, the idyllic retreat quickly devolves into a violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.\n\nThe Invitation\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Evie discovers a long-lost cousin she never knew she had. Invited by her newfound family to a lavish wedding on the English countryside, she's thrust into a nightmare of survival as she uncovers twisted family secrets.\n\nSTREAM NOW\n\nThe Hunt\n\nTwelve strangers wake up in a clearing with no idea of where they are or how they got there. Soon, they learn that they are being hunted by a group of ruthless elitists for sport, but their master plan is derailed when one of the hunted turns the tables on her pursuers.\n\nThe Blackening\n\nWhen a group of friends go away for the weekend, they find themselves trapped in a cabin with a killer who has a vendetta. They must put their street smarts and knowledge of horror movies to the test in order to stay alive."
