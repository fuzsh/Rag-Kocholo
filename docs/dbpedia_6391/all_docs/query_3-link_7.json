        "text": "Writing A Psychological Thriller\n\nIf you want to write a psychological thriller, youâ€™ve come to the right place! Iâ€™ve written a stack of these types of book, such as:\n\nThe Other Twin â€“ This psychological thriller is about a young woman who believes her sister was murdered. This is because the dead girl left behind a blog that throws suspicion on pretty much everyone they know, including the protagonistâ€™s ex-boyfriend and even their own parents.\n\nDo No Harm â€“ In this book, a couple get married â€¦ but her ex-husband and the father of her son stalks them in order to get his family back. Pretty soon their lives are ruined and even in danger.\n\nNever Have I Ever â€“ This book is about a writer who moves back to her hometown in Devon â€¦ only for mysterious and threatening notes to start arriving, referencing a dark secret from her past. (No, itâ€™s not an autobiography! Arf).\n\nToxic â€“ This YA novel I released in 2018 has an element of psychological thriller to it. Itâ€™s about a young teen who has to take on some â€˜Mean Girlsâ€™ that summer â€¦ and ends up waaaaaay over her head, even breaking the law.\n\nKill For It â€“ In this serial killer thriller, thereâ€™s a real battle of wits between a veteran journalist and her protege. The latter decides to break the glass ceiling by killing people so she can be first on the scene to report on the murders!\n\nThe Good Mother â€“ This dark, gory satire on parenthood asks the reader: what would YOU do if you discovered your teenage son was a serial killer? What the protagonist does next is shocking!\n\nMy new one! This one will be out in summer 2024. So, watch this space ðŸ˜‰\n\nSo if you want to write a psychological thriller too, hereâ€™s some of my top tips to help â€¦ Ready? Letâ€™s go!\n\n1) Start with an intriguing premise\n\nYour story should start with a bang! Draw your readers in with an enticing and mysterious premise. Ask yourself what dark secrets your characters are hiding, or what could drive someone to commit a crime.\n\nIn my psychological thriller Never Have I Ever, it starts with my protagonist receiving an anonymous note. It reads: â€˜Never have I ever â€¦ been punished for what I have done.â€™ But what could THAT be about?? Eeek!\n\n2) Create believable characters\n\nPsychological thrillers centre around characters who are often flawed and damaged, which can make them difficult to create. Pay attention to their backstories, motivations, and needs in order to make them fully fleshed-out individuals.\n\nItâ€™s important to ensure that your characters feel real and relatable, even if theyâ€™re not always likeable. (Remember, female characters are often accused of being â€˜unlikeableâ€™ anyway, no matter what they do! I call this the â€˜female burdenâ€™).\n\n3) A Compelling Protagonist\n\nA compelling protagonist is particularly important in this genre. Itâ€™s important to choose someone readers can empathise with and root for throughout the novel. Create a detailed character sketch of your main character, including their motivation for solving the mystery at hand.\n\n4) Intriguing Secondary Characters\n\nIn addition to a well-developed protagonist, your story will also need believable and interesting secondary characters. These characters should contribute to the plot in a meaningful way, without taking away from the mystery itself.\n\nSince secondary characters should HELP or HINDER the protagonist, I always recommend putting your secondary characters on â€˜team protagâ€™ or â€˜team antagâ€™. This way, you can be sure secondaries are pulling their weight in the story.\n\n3) Build suspense slowly\n\nA successful psychological thriller takes its time in ramping up the suspense and tension. Keep your readers guessing by slowly revealing information about your characters and their pasts, while also raising the stakes as the story progresses.\n\nAvoid rushing things â€¦ a slow burn really is key in this genre! Make sure you study visual representations of structure and plotting archetypes so you can make the most of tension and suspense.\n\n4) A Richly Described Setting\n\nThe setting of your story is just as important as the characters populating it. Choose a location that is rich in history and detail, then use vivid descriptions to bring it to life for readers.\n\nIn my books, I frequently write about seaside towns out of season. This is because my characters are often outsiders, cut off from others. If youâ€™ve ever been in such a place in winter, you will know seaside towns are often shut down and cut off during the winter months. This is an example of the storyworld reflecting the charactersâ€™ lives and dilemmas.\n\n5) Choose your VERY ending carefully\n\nThe ending of a psychological thriller is especially importantâ€”it should be both climactic and satisfying without being too predictable or pat. Twist endings can be particularly effective in this genre, so long as they make sense within the context of the story as a whole.\n\nNever, ever, ever fly in an ending out of the â€˜left fieldâ€™. Sometimes it can help to start with your ending and plot backwards to â€˜findâ€™ the beginning when it comes to twists.\n\nEditing, Polishing and Setting Your Story Free\n\nEditing, polishing and setting your story free are all important aspects of writing a psychological thriller. It is important to keep your readers engaged by making sure your story is well-written and edited.\n\nThere are many ways to edit your story, but it is important to take your time and do it right. Here are some tips for editing, polishing and setting your story free:\n\n1) Take your time!\n\nDonâ€™t rush through the editing process. Once you have written your first draft, put it away for a few days or weeks before you start editing. This will give you some distance from the material and allow you to come back with fresh eyes.\n\n2) Be ruthless\n\nWhen you are editing, be ruthless in cutting out anything that doesnâ€™t move the story forward or add anything new. Get rid of any unnecessary details or scenes that drag on too long.\n\n3) Make sure everything makes sense\n\nAs you are editing, make sure that everything in the story makes sense. Check for any plot holes or inconsistencies and fix them before moving on.\n\n4) Pay attention to dialogue\n\nDialogue is an important part of any story, but it is especially important in a psychological thriller. Make sure that each characterâ€™s dialogue sounds natural and believable. Listen for any awkward phrases or stiffness in the dialogue and revise accordingly.\n\n5) Let others read it\n\nI know itâ€™s scary, but you need othersâ€™ opinions and suggestions on your work. I always recommend going as far as you can with peer review, or writersâ€™ group critiques BEFORE you pay for notes or feedback though. Why not join the B2W Secret Facebook Group â€“ we have a dedicated peer review chat thread!\n\nGood Luck!"
