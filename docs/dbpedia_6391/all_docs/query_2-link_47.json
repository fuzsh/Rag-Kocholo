        "text": "There’s something about psychological thriller books that invokes 10 different ranges of emotions within a short period of time. The rush and excitement you feel because of their gripping, suspenseful nature is like taking a shot of adrenaline. These books have the tendency to immerse you in twisted plots and complex characters, triggering a mix of anticipation, fear, and curiosity. It's like riding a roller coaster—heart pounding, palms sweating, and occasionally peeking through your fingers. The thrill of it is in unravelling mysteries, uncovering dark secrets, and navigating unpredictable twists.\n\nHere are some lesser-known psychological thriller books that are even more unnerving than some popular thriller movies\n\n1. I Know What You've Done by Dorothy Koomson\n\nPublished in 2021, this is a gripping psychological thriller that delves into secrets, betrayal, and redemption. The story follows a group of friends haunted by a tragic event from their past, which resurfaces years later with–wait for it–devastating consequences, obviously. Koomson skillfully weaves together suspense and emotional depth, keeping readers on the edge of their seats while exploring themes of guilt, forgiveness, and the complexities of human relationships. This compelling novel challenges perceptions and unfolds a riveting narrative that will leave readers questioning loyalties and the true nature of trust.\n\n2. House Woman by Adorah Nworah\n\nThis book will spook you out of meeting your partner’s family or getting into an arranged marriage situation of any sort. The book follows Ikemefuna who dreams of an All-American life in Texas but faces stark realities when she moves in with her in-laws. As pressure mounts for a grandson, she grapples with her husband's family influence and unsettling family secrets. Honestly, not to be read before tying the knot.\n\n3. Speak of the Devil by Rose Wilding\n\n“All of us knew him. One of us killed him…” If this hasn’t hooked you already then let me convince you why you should invest your time in this 300-page novel. Speak of the Devil is a 2023 book where seven women are gathered in a hotel room at midnight with a man's head sitting in the centre of the floor. They all had a motive to kill him, but they all swear they didn't. Fans of Bad Sisters on Apple TV+ would love this fast-paced thriller.\n\n4. A Short Stay in Hell by Steven L. Peck\n\nThis short novella explores existential themes through a unique and unsettling narrative. The story follows the protagonist, Soren Johansson, who finds himself in a surreal and incomprehensible afterlife—a library containing every possible book ever written. As Soren navigates this infinite and bewildering space, Peck raises profound questions about the nature of existence, knowledge, and the human condition. This captivating and philosophical work challenges readers to contemplate the vastness of the unknown and the limits of human understanding.\n\n5. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara\n\nThe book that coined the term “trauma porn” in the literary world is a profound and emotionally intense novel that delves into themes of friendship, trauma, and resilience. The story follows four college friends living in New York City, with a focus on Jude St. Francis, a complex character haunted by a dark past. Yanagihara masterfully portrays the intricacies of human relationships and the lasting impact of trauma on identity. Through vivid prose and deep characterisation, this novel explores profound themes of love, suffering, and the enduring strength of the human spirit. It is a brick of a novel to read, but if you want to feel intensely, then be prepared to go through a range of emotional turmoil with every twist and turn.\n\n6. The Guest List by Lucy Foley\n\nIf you’re a fan of White Lotus, then add Lucy Foley’s The Guest List to your TBR list. The book is a thrilling and atmospheric mystery set on a remote island off the coast of Ireland. The story unfolds during a lavish wedding celebration marred by tension and secrets among the guests. Foley skillfully weaves together multiple perspectives, building suspense and intrigue as hidden motives and betrayals come to light. With vivid descriptions and complex characters, this gripping novel will keep you guessing until the shocking finale.\n\n7. I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid\n\nThis is a weird book and if you’ve seen the Netflix movie, then you know it. Iain Reid plots this haunting and atmospheric psychological thriller, exploring themes of identity, memory, and existential dread. The story follows an unnamed narrator on a road trip with her boyfriend to visit his parents' secluded farm. As the journey unfolds, unsettling events and eerie encounters begin to unravel the fabric of reality. Reid's masterful prose and suspenseful pacing create a chilling narrative that keeps readers on edge, culminating in a mind-bending conclusion."
