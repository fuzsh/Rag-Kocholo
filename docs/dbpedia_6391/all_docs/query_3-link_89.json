But for those willing to boldly explore the messy tangles where moral certainties fray, tantalizing tales await twisting common sense into arresting revelation.\n\nLet these provocative ideas infect your imagination with the delirious fever of infinite possibility.

Fearlessly explore what would, could and should happen next when decorum dissolves and our species’ untamed heart races past reassuring rhythm.\n\nWith inspiration spanning repressed memories, mystery illnesses, sinister doubles, behavioral contagions, hallucinated commands and more, these provocative psychological thriller prompts lock loaded and await your dangerous imagination’s sparking trigger finger.
