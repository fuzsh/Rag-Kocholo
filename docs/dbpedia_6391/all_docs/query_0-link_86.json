        "text": "The new thriller/horror movie Split (rated R) is not your normal “horror movie” with ghosts or demons. This horror is in one man and his multiple personalities. Manoj “M. Night” Shyamalan, writer and director of Split, and director of several popular horror films, puts on a psychological show that will be remembered.\n\nThree girls are kidnapped and trapped inside a car and are later taken to a mysterious shelter. Casey, Claire, and Maria struggle to find where they are, get out, and get help. After hearing a woman’s voice outside their door, they begin to call for help. Simple enough. Confused and afraid, they realize the woman is the man who has abducted them. Little do they know the man suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder.\n\nDissociative Identity Disorder is when a person believes he/she has more than one identity in their body. It changes the person’s mood, actions, and feelings.\n\nJames McAvoy plays the kidnapper, Kevin Wendell in Split. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula (three girls) play key roles in the movie, but no one will remember what or who they played as. Wendell has 23 identities, and they all try to “protect” Kevin from danger. The three main identities who take control are Dennis, Patricia, and Hedwig. These three tell the girls that the “beast” is coming for them. This would be Kevin’s 24th identity, that has yet to be revealed.\n\nShyamalan said in an interview, “I’ve always been interested in how the brain works, and I’ve always been intrigued by DID [Dissociative identity disorder]. I’ve always been fascinated with the elements of psychology and why we believe what we believe.”\n\nSplit is an amazing and outrageous movie. Shyamalan sets a high bar for scary stories. Split introduces a new kind of creepy, and James McAvoy’s brilliant acting switching role to role makes everyone see the dark side of the disorder. The way it is filmed keeps everyone on the edge of their seats, especially during the big finale when “the beast” is revealed.\n\nJames McAvoy’s words in the big scene as Hedwig (9 year-old boy) gave the chills to everyone watching saying, “He’s done awful things to people, and he’ll do awful things to you.”\n\nSplit was Shyamalan’s first big horror movie ever since The Sixth Sense. He did, however, direct The Visit two years ago, but that movie wasn’t as big (in potential) as Split was.\n\nI rank this 4.5 out of 5 stars because Split was an electrifying comeback for Shyamalan, but it has too much humor to add to the creepiness. Hedwig is the funny personality in the movie.\n\nOne scene is where Hedwig says “My name’s Hedwig. I have red socks. He’s on the move.”\n\nMovie review website, Rotten Tomatoes said, “Split serves as a dramatic tour de force for James McAvoy in multiple roles – and finds writer-director M. Night Shyamalan returning resoundingly to thrilling form.”\n\nAnother movie review website, Roger Ebert said, “‘Split,’ such an exciting return to form. A rare, straight-up horror film from Shyamalan, ‘Split’ is a thrilling reminder of what a technical master he can be.”"
