Night Shyamalan shared his vision of the apocalypse in Knock at the Cabin (2023). In the film, four strangers appear at a remote cabin to tell two fathers and their daughter that one of them must die to prevent the apocalypse. Watching the family struggle with the monumental decision turns the film into much more than just a horror movie: It’s also deeply emotional and thought-provoking. The film stars Dave Bautista, Rupert Grint, Ben Aldridge and Jonathan Groff.\n\nWatch Knock at the Cabin on Amazon Prime Video\n\nMax\n\nJoker\n\nIn the gritty streets of early-1980s Gotham City, aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) paints his face with blotchy makeup for his job as a clown, longing to carve out a space for himself in the world. Yet, as society subjects him to perpetual bullying and neglect, Fleck's tenuous grip on reality falters — paving the way for the dawn of his villainous identity, the Joker. (Be sure to catch this one before the highly-anticipated sequel starring Phoenix and Lady Gaga hits theaters in October 2024.)\n\nWatch Joker on Max\n\nBlack Swan\n\nIn this 2010 psychological thriller, Natalie Portman gracefully steps into the pointe shoes of a dedicated ballerina named Nina.

The police and town grapple with a murder that doesn’t make sense — and consider that supernatural forces may be at play. Bateman is joined in the cast by Ben Mendelsohn and Cynthia Erivo, among others.\n\nWatch The Outsider on Max\n\nPeacock\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nEmerald Fennell's directorial debut — which snagged her an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay — follows Cassie (Carey Mulligan), a med school dropout who orchestrates her own form of justice: playing the drunken damsel at nightclubs to expose predatory men. Reconnecting with a former classmate, Ryan (Bo Burnham), Cassie's journey takes a dark twist as she takes revenge on those who've wronged her best friend.

The indie film's cast includes Jake’s sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze.\n\nWatch Donnie Darko on Peacock\n\nParamount+\n\nShutter Island\n\nThe 2010 blockbuster hit Shutter Island, directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a U.S. marshal who travels to a psychiatric hospital for criminals located in the middle of Boston Harbor to search for a missing patient. But the hospital is not what it seems, and the movie is loaded with enough twists to make your head spin.\n\nWatch Shutter Island on Paramount+\n\nBeau Is Afraid\n\nFrom the creative genius behind psychological horrors like Hereditary (2018) and Midsommar (2019) comes a surrealist tragicomedy about a fear-ridden, agoraphobic man named Beau Wasserman, who confronts his biggest fears on an emotional odyssey to get home to his mother. With Joaquin Phoenix playing the adult Beau and Armen Nahapetian as his younger self, Beau Is Afraid showcases outstanding performances from a talented cast including Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Parker Posey and more.\n\nWatch Beau Is Afraid on Paramount+\n\nWhat Lies Beneath\n\nThe hit 2000 supernatural thriller What Lies Beneath stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford as a married couple, Claire and Norman, who seemingly have the perfect life, until a supernatural entity reveals a tragic secret. Claire begins to put the pieces together — but she realizes she might be trapped in a deadly game.\n\nWatch What Lies Beneath on Paramount+\n\nRed Eye\n\nIn Wes Craven's Red Eye (2005), hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) finds herself embroiled in a high-stakes assassination plot when she meets a winsome yet menacing Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) during a red-eye flight to Miami. As Jackson holds Lisa's father hostage, he coerces her to aid in his plan by reassigning the target's hotel room, leaving her with a moral dilemma between saving her dad or preventing a terrorist act — all while 30,000 feet above the ground.\n\nWatch Red Eye on Paramount+\n\nThe Machinist\n\nIn 2004's The Machinist, Christian Bale stars as Trevor, a factory worker who suffers from severe insomnia and hasn't slept in a year. After Trevor causes an on-the-job accident, he begins having hallucinations and becomes paranoid that his co-workers are out to get him. Not even viewers will know what is real in this gripping psychological thriller, which Bale famously lost more than 63 lbs for.\n\nWatch The Machinist on Paramount+\n\nSignificant Other\n\nIn 2022’s Significant Other, invading aliens begin harvesting humans and taking their shape. Their first target before launching a full-blown invasion is a couple hiking in the woods. It’s impossible to know who is real and who is a decoy in this wildly trippy ride. The film stars Maika Monroe and Emmy nominee Jake Lacy.\n\nWatch Significant Other on Paramount+\n\nDisney+\n\nWandaVision\n\nElizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany reprised their roles as Avengers Wanda Maximoff and Vision in the 2020 miniseries WandaVision.

Also in the cast was Kathryn Hahn, who stole the show as audience favorite Agatha Harkness.\n\nWatch WandaVision on Disney+\n\nMoon Knight\n\nThe 2022 series Moon Knight was notable for taking a much darker tone than other Marvel productions. It follows Steven Grant (Oscar Isaac), a gift shop employee who realizes he has an alter ego, Marc Spector, a mercenary with connections to Egyptian gods. On top of being an action-packed series, the show is one of the most unique Marvel entities to date.\n\nWatch Moon Knight on Disney+\n\nWerewolf by Night\n\nWerewolf by Night is a standalone Marvel special centered on a group of monster hunters gathered at a castle, all hoping to gain possession of a rare and powerful gem. However, many in the competition aren’t who they seem to be. Leading the cast is Gael García Bernal, best known for his Golden Globe-winning performance on Mozart in the Jungle."
