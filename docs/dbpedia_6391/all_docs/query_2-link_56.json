        "text": "What is a thriller film ?\n\nA thriller film usually consists of a battle between the protagonist the leading character of the film and the antagonist which is the hostile person to the protagonist. The story shows that a chain of bad events building tension and suspense for the climax. The aim for the protagonist is to restore justice while the antagonist seeks to destroy it.\n\nConventions of a thriller\n\nCharacters\n\nThemes of a thriller\n\nLow key lighting\n\nQuick cuts\n\nshadows\n\nTension music\n\nBlack and white shots\n\nMontage editing\n\nCamera movement and angels\n\nVladimir Propp's theory\n\nVladimir Propp had a theory that a certain type of character had to be used in every narrative structure. His theory has changed many different film-makers to make many successful narrative stories. Propp also had a theory that every fairy tales follow a specific narrative structure.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe protagonist is often a brave male who seeks to restore the equilibrium\n\nThe antagonist will have a hidden identify that the audience will uncover as the film progress. Often the antagonist goes out for revenge from a past event.\n\nThe protagonist in the thriller Batman the Dark Knight (2008) is Batman himself\n\nThe antagonist in Batman the Dark knight (2008) is the Joker\n\nActing\n\nActing is one of the most important roles in film, if everything in a film, if everything in the film goes perfectly well and then it comes to the acting in the film and it is bad it will ruin the whole film. This means that actors/actresses have huge amounts of responsibility to transform the storyline and what the director wants from them has to be done exactly right to make the narrative clear to the audience, actors have to include all of the emotions in the film to relay to the audience and to make them see the narrative and storyline.\n\nThemes of a thriller\n\nThe themes of a thriller are usually Action thriller,Crime thriller, Psychological,Science Fiction and Religious.\n\nLow key lighting\n\nLow key lighting is a lighting effect that uses a hard light source enhance shadows in a scene. Low key lighting is all about shadows and different contrast which creates a dark mysterious atmosphere which suits the genre thriller. This atmosphere can create tension as the audience are unaware of what could be happening around a character or even in the scene.\n\nThis is a example of low key lighting from a scene of the thriller film fight club 1999,David Fincher. From the example you can see that one light is directing the lighting at one part of the face and the other part of the face is not.\n\nQuick cuts\n\nQuick cuts is a film editing technique which refers to several consecutive shots of a brief duration. It can be used to get a lot of information across to the audience very quickly, or to show a lot of energy and chaos in the scene.\n\nShadows\n\nThe use of shadows in thriller films links to the convention of low key lighting in a different way. Shadows can be used to show and represent the inner darkness within a character. This also helps creates tension and eeriness.\n\nTension Music\n\nMusic is commonly used within thrillers in order to add more suspense and tension into a scene and is usually used to add more attention to a scene and to hint to the audience something is going to happen.\n\nBlack and white\n\nBlack and white is a convention used because they help highlight the use of the shadows and low key lighting whilst also helping to create an eerie and unsettling vibe.\n\nThis is an example of a black and white used in thriller film. This is the 1960 Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock. One reason why Hitchcock shot it in black and white was because he thought it would too gory in colour. But the black and white created these shadows in the film creating that unsettling vibe.\n\nMontage editing\n\nMontage editing consists of editing short shots into a sequence in order to condense the amount of information, time and space. Two- three or more shots are played at the same time. This is used in order to make the audience feel uneasy and on the edge of their seats eager to see what will happen next.\n\nCamera movement and angles\n\nCamera movement are useful within thriller films as they can help the audience identify the atmosphere and power of a character. Close ups are used to show emotion of the characters.Low angle shots can be used to show how little/how much power of the character.\n\nCinematography\n\nCinematography is the art of motion picture photography. In a thriller film there will be a lot of close ups and extreme close ups of the protagonist character, this is often to show their emotions, also it can e used to focus on props to aid the narrative. The shots of the antagonistic character will be cut quickly and will aim to hide their identit.\n\nEditing a thriller\n\nThe director will include lots of jump cuts because there will be things happening that the audience is unaware of but is essential for the film to make sense. cross cutting is a key point in editing as it is used to build suspense which is essential for a thriller. Continues editing is used to help the audience understand the film better.\n\nMise en scene\n\nThe location is important for the film because it help the audience establish the theme\n\nLighting is often low key\n\nCostumes- antagonist will be in dark clothes if you see them. Protagonist will be in ordinary everyday clothes\n\nComposition\n\nMakeup and hair styles\n\nActing\n\nFilmstock (Black and white, or colour, fine grain or grainy )\n\nCOdes and conventions of editing\n\nMatch cut\n\nA match cut,also called a graphic match, is a cut in film editing between either two different objects, two different spaces, or two different compositions in which an object in the two shots graphically match, often helping to establish a strong continuity of action and linking the two shots metaphorically.\n\nFlash cutting\n\nFlash cutting is editing sequences so that the durations of the shots are very brief. Also referred to a shortcut a cut that has a brief duration.\n\nSubliminal Cut\n\nA cut consisting of a few frames which move so fast that the viewer is only subliminally aware of them.\n\nCross cutting\n\nEditing that alternates shots of two or more lines of action occurring in different places, usually simulations.\n\nDiscontinuity Editing\n\nAny alternative system of joining shots together using techniques unacceptable within continuity editing principles. Possibilities include mismatching of temporal and spatial relations, violations of the axis of action, and concentration on graphic relationships.\n\nElliptical Editing\n\nShots transitions that omit parts of an event, causing ellipsis in plot and story duration.\n\nJump cut\n\nA jump cut that appears to be an interruption of a single shot, It occurs within a scene rather than between scenes, to condense the shot. Either the figures seem to change instantly against a constant background, or the background changes instantly while the figures remain constant.\n\nOverlapping Editing\n\nOverlapping Cuts that repeat part or all of an action, this expands the plot duration and viewing time.\n\nInvisible Editing\n\nEditing that is so smooth that viewers become engrossed in the movie and don't notice the individual cuts also referred to as seamless editing\n\nHistory of editing\n\ntitle sequence\n\nA title sequence is a short introduction before the movie starts crediting the cast and staff\n\nwho helped make the film. It uses sound and picture with some text to help give credit out where it is due.\n\nTitle sequence should include:\n\nName of production companies\n\nDirector\n\nProducer\n\nOther key crew\n\nExecutive producer\n\nMain actors\n\nThe movie title\n\nNarrative in a title sequence\n\nThe narrative for a title sequence is like a storyboard of what is expected in the film. It is a very simple title sequence, someone is actually talking over the screen. It allows the audience to make a guess of what the character is like by hearing their voice before the movie starts. This can be done by using different tones of voice and the pitch of the voice. The audience will also get to hear whether they think the character is male or female and also give a insight into their age.\n\nStylish title sequence\n\nA stylish title sequence is a combination of straight into it and discrete. The opening of a film goes straight into the action, It uses a lot of editing with the font and text on the screen, if the font is sharp the audience could guess that the film will involve some action. For example for the title sequence for catch me if you can is very stylish and shows the narrative of storyline is show by cartoon sketches that are animated with using bright colours.\n\nDiscrete\n\nThese are separately filmed parts before the movie starts, these are used to set the mood and tone for the rest of the film.\n\nSe7en title sequence\n\nThe start of Se7en's title sequence straight away gives the audience that spooky dark feel for the film and gives the feel of suspension as well. It also doesn't tell you a lot about the narrative of the film and keeps it hidden from the audience. Linking back to thriller genre and my film I will be making I want this sort of style for my own title sequence keeping the narrative hidden but giving the audience key elements like some of the props used in the film which is very important for the film.\n\nTitle sequence practise\n\nI practised making a title sequence similar to one I would want in my final product. I used different effects whilst editing this like colour grading and the titles on wall or knife for example. This theme and tone is what I am looking for my film, the very dark and gritty theme with some violent manor.\n\nSounds used in films\n\nDiegetic sound\n\nDiegetic sound is any sound that the characters or characters on screen can hear. So for example the sound of one character talking to another would be diegetic. Normally diegetic sounds would be voices of characters, sounds made by objects in the story, music coming from instruments in the story.\n\nSound bridge\n\nA sound bridge is a type of sound editing that occurs when sound carries over a visual transition in a film. This type of editing provides common transition in the continuity editing style because of the way in which it connects the mood , as suggested by the music, throughout multiple scenes.\n\nAsynchronous\n\nAsynchronous- controlling the timing of operations by the use of pulses sent when the previous operation is completed rather than at regular intervals. Out of sound for example you might see a character die for ma gun shot but you wont hear the gun shot at the same time of when it was shot.\n\nSynchronous sound\n\nSynchronous sound is sound that is matched to certain movements occurring in the scene e.g when footsteps correspond to feet walking. Synchronous sound: Synchronous sound can be recorded on a tape or magnetic film.\n\nNon-diegetic\n\nNon- diegetic sound is any sound that the audience can hear but the characters on screen cannot. Any appearance of background music is a prime example of non-diegetic sound. Non - diegetic would normally be narrator's commentary,sound effects which is added for the dramatic effect or music.\n\nTimbre\n\nTimbre is the texture or feel of a sound and timbre would help articulate portions of the sound track. It would be the quality of a musical sound with reference to its pitch, quality and strength.\n\nTone\n\nThe tone is the mood or atmosphere of a film scene. So for example it could be serious, humorous, amusing etc..\n\nSound effect\n\nA sound other than speech or music made artificially for use in a film. Sound effects are used to simulate reality, to add or create something off scene that is not really there and it also helps the director create a mood. The simulation of reality can be anything like a door opening and closing on a spaceship or it could be a complex creation of language like Ewoks in \"Star Wars\". besides setting a mood, sound can introduce important parts of the plot.\n\nAmbient Sound\n\nAmbient sound is the background sounds which are present in a scene or location. Sounds like wind, water, birds, crowds, office noises, traffic etc... Ambient sound provides audio continuity between shots and it prevents a unnatural silence when no other sound is present.\n\nVoice-over\n\nA Voice-over is a piece of narration in a film and is not accompanied by an image of a speaker/person.\n\nCode and conventions of cinematography\n\nCinematography is the art of photography and camerawork in film making. It is also a way in which the camera is used to communicate different meanings . Also communicates essential information to the audience . Cinematography is made up of shots,angels and movement.\n\nThe History of cinematography\n\nCamera shots\n\nMedium close up (MCU)\n\nA medium close up is half between a mid shot and close up. For a shot of a person, an medium close up will include the head and shoulders. The focus will be on the subject for this shot as it only shows a little bit of the surroundings. You can still see the facial expressions of the subject.\n\nClose up (CU)\n\nA Close up shot, is a certain feature or part of the subjects takes up most of the frame. For example a close up of someone usually means a close up of their face. Close ups are very useful for showing detail and also be used as a cut in. A close up of a person's face can show their emotion of the character and it can draw the audience into the subjects personal space and their feelings.\n\nExtreme close up (ECU)\n\nThe extreme close ups shows all the extreme details in the subject. The extreme close up though is too close to show general reactions or emotion. Filmmakers use extreme close ups for many reasons like lack of room on the set when a wider shot is not possible. An extreme close up is often used in crucial points as the pace of the action quickens and scenes jump quickly from one to the next.\n\nMid shot (MS)\n\nThe mid shot shows some part of the subject in more detail in the frame. But the audience will still feel as if they were looking at the whole subject. The mid shot is appropriate when the subject is speaking without too much emotion or intense concentration.\n\nWide shot (WS)\n\nIn the wide shot,the subject will take up the full frame. It shows a lot of the area and environment around the subject. FIlm makers use this shot allow the audience to clearly see the subject and the immediate environment and area around them.\n\nVery wide shot (VWS)\n\nIn a Very wide shot the subject is visible here but only just in frame. The meaning of the shot is to place the subject into the environment, that's why it's often used as a establishing shot in which the audience is shown the whole setting. The very wide shot also allows plenty of room for action to take place or have multiple subjects appear on the screen\n\nExtreme wide shot (EWS)\n\nThe extreme wide shot is so far away that you can't see the subject and isn't even visible. The point of this shot is to show the subjects surroundings. This shot is often used for an establishing shot (The first shot of the new scene) to show the audience where the action is taking place. Also helpful in scenes where the action is very spread out.\n\nCamera angles\n\nThe bird's eye view\n\nThe bird's eye view is scene shot from directly overhead which is very unnatural and strange angle. This shot does however put the audience in a good position on looking down on the action.\n\nHigh angle\n\nFor a high angle the camera is elevated above the action using a crane to give a overview of the action in the scene. High angels make objects or even characters seem smaller and less significant. The object or characters often get swallowed up by their setting - they become part of the wider picture.\n\nEye level\n\nThe eye level is a very natural shot. The camera is positioned as though it is a human actually observing a scene so that the actors heads are on a level with the focus. They often have no dramatic power whatsoever.\n\nLow angle\n\nA low angle increases height and give a scene of speeded motion. The low angles help give a sense of confusion to a viewer, creating a powerlessness sense within the action of the scene.\n\nCamera movement\n\nDolly\n\nA Dolly is when the camera is mounted on a cart which travels along tracks for a very smooth movement.\n\nDolly zoom\n\nA dolly zoom is a camera movement technique in which the camera moves closer or further away from the subject on screen while adjusting the zoom angle to keep the subject the same size in the frame. A dolly zoom creates an unnatural effect but it does depends on the direction of the camera movement.\n\nTilt\n\nTilt movement is when you Move the camera's lens up or down while keeping it horizontal axis constant. A example would be to mount a camera on your shoulder and nod it up and down.\n\nPan\n\nThe pan movement is a horizontal camera in which the camera moves left and right about a central axis. It is normally mounted in a fixed location, on a tripod or shoulder,rather than a dolly - like movement in which the entire mounting systems moves.\n\nFollow\n\nA follow shot is when the camera follows the subject or the action. The following distance is usually kept more or less constant. The movement can be achieved by dollying or tracking.\n\nPedestal\n\nA pedestal shot is moving the camera vertically with respect to the subject. The term comes from the type of camera support know as pedestals. They are used in studios as unlike tripods pedestals have the ability to move the camera in any direction.\n\nTracking\n\nThe tracking shot is very similar to a dolly shot. The tracking shot tho is a shot in which the camera is mounted on a cart which travels along tracks. Tracking is different to a dolly shot as the camera moves parallel to the action.\n\nCinematography and sound in Inception\n\nInception cinematography and sound analyse\n\nMedia essay\n\nFocus-cinematography\n\nFilm-Inception\n\nHow is cinematography and sound represented to the audience in Inception ?\n\nCinematography plays an important part in inception and creates techniques to help build specific emotions within the audience.\n\nThe scene where Arthur is in the hotel and Yusuf was driving the van around the city impacts the audience because at this time both the characters are in different dreams and are in a multi-levelled dreams so it get more difficult to follow the story and what's going on. The audience may think that they are both in the same dream but when in fact they are in multi-levelled so it could confuse the audience. The cut backs to the dreams get faster and faster and the scene speeds up a lot until the end when Arthur fires a bullet and kills off the pace this can draw the audience to the scene more and more causing them to feel more tension and then the tension dying off when the bullet is fired. Also when dreams keep switching it puts the audience on edge because both dreams have a different action going on.\n\nThe camera movement is very fast pace and a lot of different movements is used in the scene. The Van scene used a lot of dolly/truck shots so it had a smooth movement about the scene. When Arthur is the hotel the camera movement used on him is a lot of follow movement so the camera is following more constant distance as he was going around the hotel. Also in the hotel tilt movement was used when the gravity went off the camera was following Arthur and the other guys from the ceiling to the floor this impacts the audience showing how weird this dream was and how confusing it can be .The camera movement used in the hotel scene with Arthur emphasizes the action in the scene as it mixes fast paced action with the fear of the main protagonist which has a big impact with the audience. When Yusof is driving the speeding van way from the other security forces the camera follows the rear of the speeding van and slowly moves around to the side and then to the front wheel it then slowly moves up towards the driver windows creating a smooth camera movement.\n\nThe camera shots used in the scene are very similar throughout the scene. At the start of the scene a wide shot is used to show Arthur and the other team which are sleep. A Lot of close ups of Arthur as well and over shoulder shots when Arthur is in the corridor. A lot of close ups are used when and Yusuf is driving the van getting is reaction to all the carnage which is happening in the scene. Also the fighting scene when Arthur is fighting the security a lot of wide shots are used to show them fighting and showing the impact of the violence. The different camera angle combined with the camera movement in the scene has a vast impact on the audience and they can get engrossed in the film. The director uses them to increase emphasis on certain points of the scene especially at the end of the scene when Arthur shots the security guard because the camera movement slows down and the camera shot goes back to close up to show the importance of the scene.\n\nThe camera angles used in scene are very similar throughout the scene. Most of the camera angels are at eye level like when Yusof is in the van most of the angles are at eye level but some are at a low angles when it’s filmed outside the van. High level shots are used when the van is tipped over and when Arthur is fighting on the ceiling in the hotel. Camera angles used in the scene provide depth into the shot and help the audience to become engrossed in the film as they become more intrigued with what is actually happening on screen. A really effective scene which uses good camera angle is when the low angle shot when the gun slides on the floor towards Arthur that angle focus on the gun being the main point on screen.\n\nThe sound used in the scene is very high and loud throughout the scene. The first part of the scene is a motorbike and van going through the streets with gunshots being fired and glass smashing. Both of these sounds were synchronised sound. The most of the louder sound is coming from the dream where Yusuf is driving the van. There are a lot of gunshots and glass smashing and even cars crashing. All of these sounds are diegetic sound which the characters can hear. The music builds up creating an impact for the audience as the music builds up and gets more dramatic they are on the edge to see if something will happen at the end of the scene. The music stops when Arthur shoots one of the security and the gunshot stops all the music and sound in that end of the scene.\n\nAmbient sound was used in the scene when Yusuf was driving in the rain and rainfall was very loud on the window screen. This impacts the audience by adding in ambient sound it makes it sound a lot more realistic. Sound bridge was also used in the scene as the music continued through both dreams and throughout the montage of sequences to tie the scenes together to have that impact on the audience of building up suspense.\n\nI think cinematography and sound used in films brings out a lot of impact on the film itself but also the audience. The cinematography used in inception and that scene are brilliant, the different types of shots, camera angels and camera movement were all very different. It made the scene more exciting to watch and having different types of cinematography in it affects the audience on how they are feeling through the scene. The sound was a good factor of the scene with all the gunshots and glass smashing really making it intense to watch and gives u a good idea what the action is. But overall I think both cinematography and sound is such a major part of films now and it has to be used in order to make a good, exciting film.\n\nPractical sound and cinematography task\n\nEvaluation\n\nThis was the first practical task for this course. The task was to make a 1 minute thriller film using elements like cinematography and sound. I feel like I have more of a understanding of cinematography and sound after making this video. The uses of different angles and movements make scenes more interesting and has more meaning to the film. The sound was probably the hardest element to do because we had many impacts to the raw sound when shooting the film. For example the scene where the girl is running and the man is chasing her the wind was very strong that day meaning it blocked our sound effects in the film.\n\nPeer Feedback and comments\n\nName: Lee Howarth\n\nDate: 17/10/2016\n\nWhat was good: I think the film is great and has brilliant sound that blends with the cinematography,\n\nImprovements: Location between the road and the building needs to be changed and the enthusiasm coming from Victoria.\n\nName: Lewis Hall\n\nDate: 17/10/2016\n\nWhat was good: The location was very good. The camera angles and some of the shots were very good as well. The music matched the actions and effects that happened in each scene.\n\nImprovements: The ending ruined it and needs to be improved.\n\nName: Jordan perks\n\nDate: 18/10/2016\n\nWhat was good: Shots were creative and used different angles and heights. Different techniques were used which made the film more pleasing to watch. Your location was good for your theme and set an appropriate mood for what was about to happen. Music was alright too i guess.\n\nImprovements: Contingency outside could have used some improving and the acting was a little iffy at some times.\n\nProgression- What have I learnt so far\n\nWhat I have learnt so far is different elements of sound in a thriller film like soundbridge, asynchronous and diegetic sound. Also learning all the techniques in cinematography like the angles,shots and camera movement. When we did the practical cinematography and sound task we learnt that changing the camera shots was important to make the film flow. Also getting more raw sound when filming sound.\n\nAudience theory\n\ntODOROV'S tHEORY\n\nIn 1969 Todorov displayed his theory of which he thought was in every film.He stated that there were 5 narrative stages in the film; Equilibrium: which was a normal everyday life for the characters. Disruption of the equilibrium: which is where something changes in an everyday life and disturbs the normality of the day. Recognition of the disruption: The disruption gets noted and the characters start to figure out what has gone wrong. An attempt to repair the damage: this is where the problem is noted and the characters start to try and change the disruption and try to make it back to normal. New Equilibrium: this is where the problem gets solved and all the characters go back to normality.\n\nTarget audience for a thriller film\n\nMost common themes in most thrillers are violence, psychological issues. These both may be a problem for younger audiences, but sometimes may be also too intellectually demanding for younger audiences. Because of this, the thriller genre as a whole is often aimed at more adult audiences. Thriller films are usually certificated 15 due to the content of the film. Thrillers also appeal to both female and males. Males are interested in Thrillers due to the action and females are usually attracted to thriller because they like to watch something that plays questions in there head and to try and figure out puzzles.\n\nMise en scene in Seven\n\nSe7en Mise-en-scene Analysis\n\nMedia essay\n\nFocus- Mise-en-scene\n\nFilm- Se7en\n\nHow is Mise-en-scene represented to the audience in Se7en ?\n\nMise-en-scene is the five recognizable attributes of the film so what you can see on the screen. Mise-en-scene is a French term meaning 'what is put into a scene or frame'. The five elements of Mise-en-scene is setting and props, costume, hair and make up, Facial Expressions a body language, lighting and colour and position of characters/objects in the frame. Each aspect of Mise-en-scene has hidden meanings within a film and sends signal to the audience about how we are supposed to feel at a certain point. The elements of Mise-en-scene are pointers of what the genre would be and what the audience would expect to see in the film. The film se7en is directed by David Fincher and has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as star actors. The film is about Two Detectives who are hunting down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins to kill his vitamins.\n\nThe opening of the film begins with an establishing shot of one of the main characters (Morgan Freeman) who is shown in his home. The audience are able to see that it is his home as its well organised, tidy and decorated home. This may put the audience off because its not what u except to see at the start of a thriller film as they stereotypical start off dark and a gloomy setting as in this film it starts of with a bright setting. Getting to see the characters home gives the audience clues into what sort of person he is and what key characteristics of the character allowing them to become more familiar with the character so it makes them more engaged in the film.\n\nFrom this opening scene you can see that the character starts putting on a suit and tie and dressing up smartly in a stereotypical detective clothing representing his career and giving him that sense of importance. This may give the audience a sense that he may be the main character of the film if he is in a deactivate clothing meaning he is important. Genre of film it is the main character in the film needs to keep the audience feeling that the character is superior to the audience. It is largely important that the audience builds some kind of relationship with the main character he can be well liked by the audience.\n\nAfter the first opening scene we are then introduced to a second character (Brad Pitt) who is a very young character and is not as caring as the other deactivate. This is shown through his relaxed body language and cheeky personality. The contrast in behaviour is also represented in the different costumes they wear differently between both men. Deactivate somerset (Morgan freeman) is dressed in very typical old fashioned detective clothing whereas brad is wearing more casual clothes with a leather jacket. The audience is shown the house that the crime is located and the differences in how both scenes are presented become drastically apparent. The look of the entire opening scene is very rough and raw. The house is run down and undecorated and a dull and gloomy atmosphere is created by using low key lighting which is typical of the thriller genre and this film has mostly in low key lighting with lights being the same most of the time. This is to keep the tension high and the mood dark, it also links the film with dark ideas such a murder and serial killers. This technique is used to give the audience the idea that something terrible has occurred or is about to occur, creating a sense on tension and eeriness.\n\nThis scene when they leave the crime scene they come out into a typical busy urban city that the film is set in but the lighting hasn't changed. This suggests to the audience that the worst is not over. This also connoted from the rain pouring down on the characters suggesting that something bad has happened and its not leaving. But this setting is showing the audience what it looks like and to familiarise themselves with the setting of the film showing the poorer, dirty and run down area of America.\n\nThe setting used in the film Se7en is a dull urban city where it is mostly pouring down with rain all the time and the streets are always busy. The vitamins are always normally found in a dark gloomy room showing the darkness of the film in general. As for the props, guns play an important role in the film Almost every main character owns one and uses, or attempts to use one somewhere down the line. They also use there flash lights when they go into the murder scenes this creates a spotlight and they pick out certain things in the room with this only light giving the audience something to keep a eye out.\n\nThe detective costumes are all very smart looking as they are wearing a suit and a tie making look important for the job. The police force also wearing the body armour and police uniform. The people in the street wearing costumes are causal clothes but not smart giving a expression of the whole film that the setting there in is very ruin down and poor where people don't have smart clothes but the detectives making them stand out. The make up used is very effective in the film and towards the audience. One scene detective mills has blood and cuts on his face making feel realistic helping the audience in vision it making see what's going on.\n\nThe facial expressions and body language is different with all the characters as detective mills (Brad Pitt) is more relaxed body language as detective somerset (Morgan Freeman) is more on edge with the crime cases and the whole case itself. The serial killer as well is very cool and relaxed body language as he knows his plans already. The facial expressions on the characters in the film stern you cant see there emotional as they are very professional and mills shows his emotional more as he cant find the killer as Summerset is more professional so he doesn't show his emotional.\n\nlighting is same throughout the film very dark, gloomy places so very low key lighting. But when there is light its this grey light outside and when inside its more of a orange light in the rooms. This could create high tension and the moody atmosphere. The colours are dark creating shadows in the film and creating this black colours in the scenes. Dark arc colours like red, black and grey colours creating danger and tension.\n\nSymbolic meaning in the film is the ticking sound of the clock on the side of the bed in detective summersets house. The ticking sound from the clock could mean time is running out for them to find the killer.\n\nThe film se7en represents Mise en scene by using the use of costumes, colour and lighting and editing and location. For example the clothing wore by the detectives are smart meaning the audience know they are important characters in the film. The colours and lighting used in the film are very dark with low lighting creating a dark atmosphere and building tension. So I think Mise en Scene is very important in this films and in thriller films in general it creates signals and feelings to the audience at certain points.\n\nPractical Mise-en-scene Task\n\nTo practise using and getting with grips with Mise en scene I made a short film in a post apocalyptic world were some survivors are trying to find shelter and set a camp before night and when they do set up camp a creature is lurking from the bushes and is ready to kill. In the film we experimented with Mise en scene by having different costumes and make up for the film to set the post apocalyptic theme. Also the location used was very isolated and fitted the theme and tone for the film. Even some of the props used are tins of food for the survivors.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThis was the third practical task for this course. The task was to make a 1 minute thriller film focus being Mise en Scene . I feel some more understanding of Mise En Scene meaning everything on screen that the audience see. I really focused on creating good visual costumes for the the theme of the film. There clothes are ripped and very rough looking giving it that gritty look. The make up and effects on the zombie creature at the end of the film was very effective and looked realistic. The location used was perfect for the post apocalyptic film as its very isolated in the woods.\n\nPEER FEED back and comments\n\nName: Tyler Nation\n\nDate: 13/01/2017\n\nWhat was good: The costume and make was very good and realistic also a good location was used as well\n\nImprovements: The camera needed to be on a tripod more often really shaky\n\nName: Lewis Hall\n\nDate: 13/01/2017\n\nWhat was good: The location was very good. The camera angles and some of the shots were very good as well. The zombie creature was very cool as well.\n\nImprovements: The lightning was too dark and needed improving\n\nPreliminary task\n\nMy potential audience\n\nMy potential audience for my film would be looking towards the age rating of 12A or 15 depending on the content used in the film eg violence, swearing etc. Doing research I found out that both male and female Like watching thriller films. So going from this I want my target audience to be for mix genders and looking at a age range between 15-35.\n\nAnalysis of research\n\nGetting all of this research will help me with my pre production and my final piece. I now understand the codes and conventions of a thriller and the different elements within film cinematography,mise en scene, sound and editing. I also know about the target audiences for thriller films which will help me a lot for my very own film."
