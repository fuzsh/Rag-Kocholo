        "text": "This article discusses how the movie “Get Out”, directed by Jordan Peele, introduces sensitive experiences about horror and racism in contemporary societies. The concept of horror is understood through Eugene Thacker, for whom the genre fruition occurs by the act of thinking in an unthinkable world, non-hu-man and unknown. Considered as the other in the Western society, the condition of being black, category created during the slavery and colonization process for the dehumanization of Africans (GILROY, 2007), answers this genre definition. The act of being black provokes horror in whom ignores the human condition, at the same time its affected in their humanity by the racism. This essay promotes the encounter between two researches that investigate the characteristics of aesthetics experiences of horror in contemporaneity: thinking the phenomenon beyond fear (ACKER, 2018) with that one proposes a criticism to structural racism in the media (CAMPOS, 2018).\n\nJordan Peele’s Get Out: Political Horror is a collection of sixteen essays devoted to exploring Get Out’s roots in the horror tradition and its complex and timely commentary on twenty-first-century US race relations. The first section, “The Politics of Horror,” traces the influence of the gothic and horror tradition on Peele’s film, from Shakespeare’s Othello, through the female gothic and Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby and The Stepford Wives, to the modern horror film, including the zombie, rural, suburban, and body-swap subgenres of horror. The second section, “The Horror of Politics,” takes up Get Out’s varied political interventions—notably its portrayal of the continuation of slavery and the deformation of the black body and mind in white, so-called progressive America. Contributors address Peele’s film alongside African American figures such as Nat Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, and James Baldwin. Taken together, the essays illuminate how Get Out stands as both a groundbreaking intervention in the horror tradition as well as a devastating unmasking of racism in the contemporary United States.\n\nRacism is a belief or ideology that all members of each racial groups possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially to distinguish it as being either superior or inferior to another racial group. Continuation of a racism is stereotype. Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category. Literary works applying this concept in many worked and one of them is film. Therefore, the writer is interested in discussing the mentioned topic with objective of the research: To identify how racism constructed in Get Out movie and to analyze the stereotype of racism appeared in Get Out movie. The method used in this research is sociology of literature, because it is appropriate to analyze literary work which focused on the racism attitude in Get Out movie script. The grand theory for the topic is Racism a Short History by George M. Fredrickson and Stereotype as Explanations by Craig McGarty. While the obj...\n\nI have been the evolving field of grassroots social justice education. I call the tradition that I grew up in \" grassroots \" because we were interested in how to teach and learn effectively on social justice, \" diversity and inclusion \" , and related issues. I have been deeply involved in the use of films as a resource for powerful learning conversations about social issues. Two other films that I have written about the use of both documentaries and hollywood feature films in the classroom. It never occured to me that the horror genre film could be an exceptionally potent tool for a social justice educator, or any educator interested in pushing learning into the transformative, paradigm-shifting, life-changing dimension. I get it now. Get Out​ is an exceptional resource for transformative learning for several reasons: Firs​ t, the mind naturally thinks in stories. Human beings are story-telling animals. Sharing and conversing, aka \" conversating \" about stories is a basic human practice of entertainment and sharing and creating knowledge. Scary stories have always been a part of the teaching canon of people all over the world.​ Get Out ​ is completely aligned with the oldest traditions of communal storytelling. ​ Get Out​ is only one of innumerable stories that terrifies, teaches and entertains us all at the same time. After the story-telling, the \" storytelling about the story \" , the communal meaning-making, tacit collaborative learning. ​ Get Out​ is the work of an afrofuturist griot. Second​ , learning that changes hearts and minds generally needs a strong emotional catalyst to activate the process. Events like the slaying of Michael Brown, or the death in custody of Sandra Bland can be a real-life trigger for transformative learning and change. The Mississippi church bombings and the Kent State Massacre were catalytic events Creative works that elicit strong feeling can be as catalytic as real events that disrupt sense of stable knowledge about ourselves, our relationship to others, or our world. Third, ​ Horror, is a genre of film and literature which explores human fears and questions about the nature of evil, survival in the face of violence and absurdity. As such, although I have never thought about it until now, it is a vehicle of cultural expression that Black people have that predates the history of cinema. Black America has always been intimately acquainted with personal and pervasive social horror. All Black people recognize the horror in Chris's face. Only"
