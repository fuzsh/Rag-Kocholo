        "text": "Any list of the best psychological thrillers needs to start by answering a basic question: what separates a psychological thriller from a regular old thriller? As the phrase implies, it mostly has to do with the mind. In the best examples, special attention is paid to the mental disposition of its characters, and the thrills themselves are derived from how those motivations influence the movement of the plot.\n\nThat might sound a bit cold, maybe alienating. But the greatest psychological thrillers play on elemental fears, traumas and delusions. As one particularly disturbed young man once said, we all go a little mad sometimes – and that’s what makes the genre so relatable…and often frightening. These are 32 of the absolute best.\n\nRecommended:"
