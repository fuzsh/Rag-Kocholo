        "text": "Some of my favorite psychological thrillers have been massive commercial hits that were also nominated for many major awards; for example, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and FATAL ATTRACTION. Yet no movie in the genre has ever disturbed me as much as FRAILTY — a low-budget, largely-ignored gem released in 2002 as the directorial debut of the late Bill Paxton. It revolves around an FBI investigation into a string of serial murders occurring in the Dallas, Texas area. They are referred to as the “God’s Hand” killings because the first victim was found with a note saying he had been taken by “God’s Hand.” The point person on the case, Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) is visited one night by a haunted-looking man, Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey.) Meiks claims he knows the identity of the killer — his brother Adam, who just shot himself in the head.\n\nThe film largely unfolds in flashback as Meiks describes his background to Doyle. He and his brother grew up in the small (fictional) town of Thurman, Texas, where their childhood was initially tranquil and their single father (Bill Paxton — only referred to as “Dad”) was kind. Their peace is shattered when Dad wakes them up one night to tell them he had a vision. An angel told him that there are demons disguised as humans and that God has tasked the family with destroying them — designating the trio as “God’s Hands.” Fenton is worried his father is losing his mind, and this worry turns to horror when Dad begins kidnapping and killing local residents after being “sent a list” by God. In the present, adult Fenton believes that adult Adam took up his father’s mission, taking out the “demons” himself.\n\nFRAILTY is more unsettling than the standard psychological thriller because of the nature of its antagonist. Instead of an unstable stranger, we have a family member — someone you are supposed to trust. There is nothing scarier than having that trust violated, and having to fear the familiar. More distressingly, the witnesses to this instability are children. Children are supposed to feel a certain sense of security. Thus, when Dad appears to lose his bearings and engages in violent acts, seeing the kids cope with this is more upsetting than it would be to watch an adult endure similar circumstances. In fact, it feels like witnessing abuse.\n\nThis situation is disquieting, but what makes the film most disturbing is its portrait of gradual indoctrination. While young Fenton steadfastly rejects Dad’s ramblings, young Adam quickly accepts them and becomes more of a believer over time, to the point that he desperately wishes to carry out a killing himself. This situation speaks to how repeated exposure to certain viewpoints from a parent can result in children embracing ideas rejected by decent society. In that sense, the movie could serve as an allegory for the brainwashing of kids into adherence to harmful belief systems such as racism, sexism, xenophobia, and homophobia.\n\nThese elements put FRAILTY (written by Brent Hanley) in a class above the average psychological thriller. It’s sad that it hasn’t achieved more awareness and recognition, but now you know. Go check out this solid first-time behind-the-camera effort from Paxton — one that also manages to subvert your expectations of its genre. Just don’t be surprised if you’re as haunted as Fenton by the end."
