Some of the films include modern indie horror flicks like \"Saw,\" \"Cube,\" \"The Exam,\" \"You're Next,\" \"Nerve\" \"The Collector/ The Collection,\" \"Identity,\" \"Vile,\" \"Would you Rather,\" \"The Game,\" \"The Strangers,\" just to name a few. There are both Modern Psychological Thrillers and Classic Horror films on this list. The majority of these films on this list involve a twisted plot, game, mystery or puzzle for both the audience and characters within the films to solve in order to survive. Some of the films feature a group of strangers, friends, or an individual who is stuck in the middle of a twisted plot. Opposite the audience and protagonist(s) in these films is the antagonist(s) and usually an overarching darker, more sinister universal horror representative of society. \n\nWhile there are many psychological/mind game horror movies on this list, it also includes many \"classic\" horror and Halloween films. Many of the films on this list toy with your mind in some way and feature twisted mind games, suspense, and psychological horror. The List also includes some made-for-tv thrillers and horror/thriller television series and limited series.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these films are in no particular order.
