Condition: Bueno. Nobody around here reads any more. Why bother, when you can just use a mindprobe needle and shoot all the images and excitement straight into your brain? I've heard of books, but they were long before I was born, in the backtimes before the Big Shake, when everything was supposedly perfect, and everybody lived rich. In real life, nobody comes to your rescue. Believe me, I know. But then I met Ryter, this old gummy who had a lot of crazy ideas. Together we tried to change the world.EAN: 9780746090794 Tipo: Libros Categoría: Título: The Last Book in The UniverseAutor: Philbrick, Rodman Editorial: Usborne.
