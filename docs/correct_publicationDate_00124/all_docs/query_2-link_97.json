        "text": "In The Book Freak The Mighty And The Mighty there are significant differences.The significant differences I saw was in the characters. The three main characters I saw were was Maxwell, Freak, And “Killer Kane” A.K.A Kenny Kane., And I will point out the changes from the book and the movie.

Well, what I tried to tell you that there are more comparisons that I could’ve done, but these are the ones that stood the most out to me so I feel like I should share them with you so I could see what you thought about them.Well, I wrapped up Maxwell, Freak, And Kenny Kane for"
