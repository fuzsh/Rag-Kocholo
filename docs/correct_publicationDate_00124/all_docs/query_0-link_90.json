        "text": "by Rodman Philbrick\n\nHas anybody read this book?\n\nIt is so good. And if you like the Hunger Games or Uglies series, this might be right up your alley. It's a super easy read. My daughter (10th grade) and son (7th grade) just had to read it for school. I read it last year and loved it so much I bought the book. (I NEVER buy books. LOL -that's what the library is for, right?)\n\nAnyhoo, my son has to do a project about the book. He currently has a D+ in the class, so not like him. Little turd. And so he HAS to do good on this project. So, obviously, I am helping him, probably helping him too much. (Thank goodness I read the book! HA!)\n\nHe has to come up with 25 NEW words........ The book uses/makes up words for items, people and places in the book. If you've read the book you'll understand. But he has to come up with a dictionary definition, pronunciation AND a picture... for 25 words!!! OY! and it's due tomorrow. LOL\n\nofcourse, he didn't tell me that last part until Tuesday. Oy, again, he's a turd. HAAAAAAAA\n\nLast night we finished all the word definitions, today he has to draw 25 pictures. Gonna be hard for verbs and places. AND extra hard for him because despite his D+ grade he is sooooooooooo the smart/perfectionist type and NOT much of an artistic bone resides in his little 13 year old body. ROFL.\n\nSo, again, I am helping him a bit more than I should on this project, but he HAS to get an A. End of Story. LOL\n\nHowever, I'm finding it difficult coming up with images for words like:\n\nbork off, googan, holoquarium, mope, proov and needlebrain.\n\nBUT thankfully, words like:\n\ncarboshake, choxbar, chetty blade, splat gun and takvee should be much easier. LOL"
