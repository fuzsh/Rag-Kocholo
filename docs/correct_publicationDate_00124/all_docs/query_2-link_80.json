        "text": "American author\n\nNathaniel Philbrick (born June 11, 1956) is an American author of history, winner of the National Book Award, and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His maritime history, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, is based on what inspired Herman Melville to author Moby-Dick, won the 2000 National Book Award for Nonfiction and was adapted as a film in 2015.[1][2][3]\n\nPhilbrick was born on June 11, 1956, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Marianne (Dennis) and Thomas Philbrick, an English professor.[4][5] He grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[6]\n\nPhilbrick attended Linden Elementary School and graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School[7] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe earned a BA in English from Brown University and an MA in American literature from Duke University,[3][8] where he was a James B.

The same year, he won the Sunfish North Americans in Barrington, Rhode Island.[9]\n\nFollowing graduate school, Philbrick worked as an editor at Sailing World magazine for four years and then as a freelancer for a number of years, during which time he was the primary caregiver for his two children while writing and editing several books about sailing, including The Passionate Sailor, Second Wind and Yaahting: A Parody.\n\nIn 1994, he published his first book about the island's history, Away Off Shore, followed in 1998 by a study of the Nantucket's native legacy, Abramâ€™s Eyes. He is the founding director of Nantucket's Egan Maritime Institute and is a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association and a leading authority on the history of Nantucket, Massachusetts.\n\nPhilbrick is married to Melissa Douthart Philbrick, former executive director of Remain Nantucket.
