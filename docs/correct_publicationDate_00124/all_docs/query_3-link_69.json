How will humans react when suddenly faced with a world that seems so different? A world without heat? A world without wi-fi?Facing the remaining  months of winter, the town must cut enough wood to keep the fires going.  Conspiracy theorist and local loudmouth U.S. government hating  compound owner  Webster Bragg has his own ideas how to handle the outage. He feels like survival of the fittest. Why waste good food and good fire wood for  old or sick people? He plans to take care of his compound and hoard weapons and goods. He's sure the government caused the black out and he says he knows for a fact that there is no more government  left.School janitor and part time volunteer police officer Reggie Kingman takes his duties seriously. He is able to calm the crowds and helps to silence Bragg. When their only grocery store burns down, the townspeople are distraught. All this hardship and now no groceries?A medical emergency forces Charlie Cobb to risk his own life by heading to a nearby town to find medical supplies.Philbrick makes dystopian fiction approachable for middle grades in The Big Dark. Similar to Bick's Ashes and Stephen King's The Dome, the townspeople drive the plot. There is a good versus evil fight and issues are  raised for book clubs to debate.The Big Dark is likely to earn Philbrick many state recognition lists  and possibly another coveted Newbery Honor.\nA quick read (178 pages) for reluctant readers. This book is available on Scholastic Book Fairs and at Scholastic warehouses. Recommended grade 4-up.\n9780545789752  Ages 9-13  178 pages\nRecommended by:  Pamela Thompson,  Library Media Specialist, Texas USA",
