        "text": "Kelli Fitzpatrick\n\nKelli Fitzpatrick\n\nWriter & Creative Producer @ Disney\n\nPublished Dec 29, 2021\n\nIn the wild year that was 2020, I read—and wrote about—40 books. Subconsciously, perhaps, this number has become a benchmark, as I yet again read 40 books in 2021! (And I'm currently working on 41 – Milk Fed by Melissa Broder.)\n\nMy reading habits this year took me through a landscape of brilliant memoirs, fantastic escapism and diverse storytellers—a few of which I discovered at my neighbor’s Free Library.\n\nBelow are my top picks of 2021 (I couldn’t bring myself to pick just 10 this year, so I’ve laid out my favorites in both memoir/nonfiction and fiction), followed by a full list of everything I read, listed in chronological order of my completion. Please comment with your recommendations for 2022!\n\nP.S. Would you be interested in a list of my “letdown” reads—the buzzy titles of 2021 that actually underwhelmed? Let me know!\n\nMEMOIR & NONFICTION\n\nA Promised Land by Barack Obama\n\nIntensely detailed, insanely intelligent and endearingly real all the same. Hearing from President Obama stirred up feelings of nostalgia and amazement, page after page.\n\nOver the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love by Jonathan Van Ness\n\nI’ve always been a JVN fan—and even met him at the West Hollywood Pride Parade, #humblebrag—and reading his brutally honest—and funny and emotional—memoir made me love and respect him even more. What a journey indeed to self-love and -acceptance! I really appreciated hearing his unfiltered, personal tale.\n\nThe Power of Ritual by Casper ter Kuile\n\nI took copious notes from this exploration of “How to Create Meaning and Connection in Everything You Do.” Casper shares countless ways to infuse ritual, spirit and meaning into daily routines. He is a truly awesome voice in this space, as he aspires to see the sacred and majestic in everything—compelling even a secular, agnostic gal like me to do the same.\n\nBetween the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nPowerful, heartbreaking and resonant. A father’s raw and honest reflections as written to his young son, about being a Black man in America. The great Toni Morrison called it “Required reading,” and I completely agree. I put this up there with Stamped from the Beginning as far as books that will shake you to your core and awaken you.\n\nFour Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019, edited by Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain\n\n400 years of history, culture, life and death, told through 90 artists and authors. Further reminders that there is so much we continue to miss in history class and modern discussion. A wonderful and illuminating must-read.\n\nHeart of Fire: An Immigrant Daughter’s Story by Mazie Hirono\n\nAn awe-inspiring memoir from the amazing Senator Hirono of Hawaii. I loved reading her stories of childhood and family, from Hawaii to Japan to D.C. Her commitment to the greater good, to the American people and to her own family and culture are inspiring and heartwarming.\n\nThe Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green\n\nMy nonfiction list concludes with a review of a book of…reviews! This collection of fun and well-researched essays examines the Anthropocene era (AKA, today, when human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment) through many wide-ranging topics—from Super Mario Kart to sunsets to CNN to whispering—prompting one to consider the outsized role of humans in all, and how we may correct the wrongs we’ve caused.\n\nFICTION\n\nQueenie by Candice Carty-Williams\n\nI flew through this book in two days at the top of 2021. Protagonist Queenie is relatable, complex and complicated. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout a tale of heartbreak, growing up, mental health, bad dates, dashed hopes, smelly apartments, loving grandparents and ride-or-die friends (whom she calls “corgis!”).\n\nThe Girl with the Louding Voice by Abi Daré\n\nA unique tale that follows Adunni, a headstrong girl who perseveres through many hardships—marriage at 14, loss of loved ones, abuse—with a determined focus on education, love and strength.\n\nThe Midnight Library by Matt Haig\n\nA lovely, original novel that explores: If you could live another life, would you? Probing thoughts about string theory, multiverse and alternate realities are kept afloat with themes of love, self-acceptance and kindness. Such a fresh and unexpected story.\n\nFreak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick\n\nA sweet and surprisingly suspenseful children’s book that my mom read with a student and wisely suggested to me. Two misfit boys find strength, adventure and friendship in one another, proving one is never too old to learn from children’s literature.\n\nThe Other Black Girl by Zakiya Dalila Harris\n\nEasily a top favorite novel of the past five years, let alone 2021. I could hardly put down this page-turner for three days straight. I read everywhere, anytime I could, because I couldn’t tear my eyes way! Killer suspense, pacing and sense of eeriness at every turn. I loved the narrator’s perspective and uncompromising wit. A nugget dropped near the end provides an opening for a sequel—I’ll be here for it!\n\nYolk by Mary H.K. Choi\n\nCouldn’t put this one down, either! I love when I fall into a nonstop novel, and Yolk is certainly one of those. Poignant and nearly poetic in its portrayal of a young woman on the edge of losing herself, then finding her sister and learning to love—herself, her family and her life. Both jarring and heartbreaking at times, this novel has a peaceful and beautiful ending.\n\nThe Office of Historical Corrections by Danielle Evans\n\nA brief and brilliant collection of short stories examining race and society. Very well done, breezily readable yet deeply resonant.\n\nAnimal by Lisa Taddeo\n\nNot for the faint of heart. Dark and gruesome, and at times difficult to read, but by the emotional end, I was glad I did. Subtly powerful in its slow-building, dual tales of trauma, strength, instinct and survival. A cliff-hanger-y ending but with closure and resolution.\n\nStay with Me by Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀\n\nA tale of family, deceit, life and death in Nigeria. A couple will do whatever it takes to have a child, but it comes at a dire cost. Another page-turner, mostly from a wife’s perspective, perfectly interjected by the husband’s. Lots of twists and a shocking ending, but full of heart and hope, against all odds.\n\nAlif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson\n\nI caught wind that a workplace book club was reading this novel as their January pick, and I got ahead by flying through it in mid-December. Fantasy meets adventure with Arabic and Islamic focuses—what a wildly fun, epic tale! I loved exploring the characters and learning about the kinds of jinn. So many vivid scenes, suspenseful trials and heartfelt relationships, set against a changing city and technological landscape.\n\nIn order of read – titles in bold are my 5-star rated!\n\nA Promised Land – Barack Obama\n\nQueenie – Candice Carty-Williams\n\nInterior Chinatown – Charles Yu\n\nThe Henna Artist – Alka Joshi\n\nThe Water Dancer – Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nMemorial – Bryan Washington\n\nAyiti – Roxane Gay\n\nShit, Actually – Lindy West\n\nThe Girl with the Louding Voice – Abi Daré\n\nHere Comes the Sun – Nicole Dennis-Benn\n\nThe Night Circus (reread) – Erin Morgenstern\n\nOver the Top – Jonathan Van Ness\n\nThe Midnight Library – Matt Haig\n\nDetransition, Baby – Torrey Peters\n\nThe Power of Ritual – Casper Ter Kuile\n\nBetween the World and Me – Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nFreak the Mighty – Rodman Philbrick\n\nFour Hundred Souls – Edited by Ibram X.
