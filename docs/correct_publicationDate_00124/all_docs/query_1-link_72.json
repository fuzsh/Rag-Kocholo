        "text": "Author: Rodman Philbrick\n\nPage Length: 221\n\nReading Level: 6\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nPLOT SUMMARY: The story is set in the future in a world that has been hit by a severe earthquake known as “The Big Shake”. As the story begins, Spaz, an epileptic 14 year-old boy is talking to Ryter, an old man, who constantly refers to books, something Spaz knows nothing about. Spaz tells Ryter that he has been kicked out of his home and forbidden to see his sister, Bean. However, he has received a message from Bean that she is sick. Together, Spaz and Ryter, along with Little Face (a young boy who likes Spaz because he gives him chocolate), set out to find Bean. They travel through the “Urbs”, using a futuristic dialect in a post-modern world.\n\nREVIEW: For those who are fans of Rodman Phibrick and science fiction, you will enjoy the world of the future that Spaz, Ryter, and Bean adventure through. I especially enjoyed the language of the future world that is used, much of it associated with the current language of today. Also, the importance of books that Ryter emphasizes to Spaz is used throughout the book. I especially like Ryter’s quote, “The only real treasure is in your head. They are memories and no one can steal them from you.” These words and Spaz’s memories inspired him to write, The Last Book in the Universe.\n\nAREAS OF TEACHING: Character, Sequence of Events, Setting, and Compare/Contrast\n\nRELATED BOOKS: Freak the Mighty, Max the Mighty, REM World\n\nRELATED WEBSITES:\n\nwww.scholastic.com/titles/features/fantasy/lastbook_rrr.asp\n\nwin.org/library/…/yas/book reviews/last book in the universe.htm\n\nwin.org/library/…/yas/book reviews/last book in the universe.htm\n\nwww.education-world.com/a_books/books170.shtml\n\nwww.avondale.k12.mi.us/meadows/yoda/forms/LastBookUniverse.html\n\nwww.answers.com/topic/w-rodman–philbrick\n\nwww.rodmanphilbrick.com\n\nREVIEWED BY: Shirley Wagner"
