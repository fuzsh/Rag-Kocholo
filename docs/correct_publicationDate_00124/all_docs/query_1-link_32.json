        "text": "“there comes a time in life when you have to choose between turning the page and closing the book” said author Josh Jameson. This quote by Josh Jameson connects to “the last book in the universe” by Rodman Philbrick by showing how good the book really is and not wanting to put it down. The author of “the last book in the universe” uses bad grammar, interesting vocabulary and short chapters to intrigue young readers who do not like to read.\n\nThe first way the author reaches his intended audience is through the use of interesting vocabulary. He uses made-up words for the futuristic world he creates that would appeal to a younger audience. For example, immediately in chapter 1 of the book, the reader is bombarded by strange, new words that …show more content…\n\nHaving short chapters intrigues readers that don’t like to read, want to read more and keep on going with their book. For example, when reading a formal book with long boring chapters, it takes forever to get through a chapter and you don’t want to keep reading because you spent forever on this one chapter, you can keep going when your book has short chapters because it’s easier to get over with it. Another way Philbrick uses short chapters in his book is because you don’t know what will happen next. “sooner or later i’ll have to go back to the stacks to find out” (Philbrick 26).when you read books, the author likes to leave cliffhangers to make you want to read the next chapter, but when you have 20 page chapters, you're not going to want to read the next chapter because it was to long, but with short chapters you can get through it faster to find out what the cliffhanger was about. The last way the author uses short chapters in his book is because it’s good to keep reading and see what happens. Rodman Philbrick uses short chapters and grammar to intrigue young readers to go out and read his book. “the Outsiders” by S.E. Hinton and “The Last Book In The Universe” by Rodman Philbrick use similar writing strategies by making up names for characters and groups. They are also different because the outsiders is for a younger audience and the last book in the universe is for a older and more mature"
