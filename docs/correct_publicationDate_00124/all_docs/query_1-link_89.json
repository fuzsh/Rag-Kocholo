        "text": "This book tells a tale of ancient myths and legends, ghostly phenomena, black and white magic and the blurring of god and evil. But this is not fantasy. There is plenty of magic in the real world if you know where to look. In a land dominated by vicious gangs and mind probe entertainment, Spaz is alone. His foster sister is the only good thing in his life and she is dying. Determined to save her, Spaz bravely sets out into dangerous and forbidden territory, accompanied only by an old man, with his philosophies and memories of what the world once was.\n\nAuthor biography Rodman Philbrick has been writing since the age of sixteen. He had published more than a dozen novels for adults before the publication of Freak the Mighty, his first book for younger readers. Since then, he has won numerous awards and honours, including the prestigious ALA Best Book for Young Adults, the California Young Reader Medal, the Arizona Young Readers' Award and the New York State 'Charlotte' Award. Lobster Boy has been awarded the 2004 CHILD magazine Best Children's Book Award."
