        "text": "About the Book\n\n\"It's Maine, 1924, and the Ku Klux Klan is on the rise. Davy and Jo Michaud have been recently orphaned. Taken in by a distant relative-a famous aviator-they are now working with a group of stunt pilots who spend their time wing walking, leaping from plane to plane, and flying through fireworks! But though the stunts are dangerous, the real threat is building behind the scenes. The KKK is on the rise in Maine that summer, inspired by the racial fears promoted in Birth of a Nation. They spew hatred of immigrants, Blacks, Jews, and French Catholics-that last, a rage that will be directed at Davy and Jo. When Davy and Jo cross paths with the Klan, they get tangled up in a terrible revenge plan, and held as hostages. Can they escape with their lives?\"--\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nA thrilling historical adventure by the master of adventure himself, Rodman Philbrick.\n\nIt's Maine, 1924, and the Ku Klux Klan is on the rise.\n\nDavy and Jo Michaud have been recently orphaned.
