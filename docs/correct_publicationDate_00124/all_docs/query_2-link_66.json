During the read aloud, I often thought about how much I would have loved this books when I was a kid. I think a lot of readers, like me, that fell in love with Hatchet, were looking for the next book. Wildfire is going to be that book for todays Wildfire readers.\n\nVideo book talk below!\n\nCheck out the official book trailer!\n\nIf you’d like to purchase the book I mentioned in this video, please click on the affiliate links below:\n\nhttps://amzn.to/2wv9MEg\n\nBook Description from the publisher:\n\nNewbery Honor author Rodman Philbrick sends readers straight into the nightmare of a raging wildfire as 12-year-old Sam is trapped by explosive flames and deadly smoke that threaten to take his life. Can he survive?\n\nFlames race toward Sam Castine’s summer camp as evacuation buses are loading, but Sam runs back to get his phone. Suddenly, a flash of heat blasts him as pine trees explode. Now a wall of fire separates Sam from his bus, and there’s only one thing to do: Run for his life. Run or die.\n\nLungs burning, Sam’s only goal is to keep moving. Drought has made the forest a tinderbox, and Sam struggles to remember survival tricks he learned from his late father. Then, when he least expects it, he encounters Delphy, an older girl who is also lost. Their unlikely friendship grows as they join forces to find civilization.\n\nThe pace never slows, and eventually flames surround Sam and Delphy on all sides. A powerful bond is forged that can only grow out of true hardship-as two true friends beat all odds and outwit one of the deadliest fires ever.\n\nAt the end of the novel, information about wildfires and useful safety tips add to the reader’s understanding of one of the US’s most dangerous natural disasters.\n\n*************************\n\nGame Changer!
