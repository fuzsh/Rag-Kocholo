No one can read and everyone is addicted to \"probing.\" But, when Spaz's sister is in trouble, he starts out on an incredible journey with his new friends. Encountering danger along the way, Spaz and friends attempt to close the gap between the waring world\n\nShow More\n\nand the perfect Eden.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member sgerbic\n\nReviewed Dec 2002\n\nI purchased this book for Stirling and couldn't put it down once I started it. A lot like other books, Ender's Game, Clockwork Orange, and various Star Trek episodes. But it is fresh in its own way with much hope for the future. You can't help but cheer for Spaz and friends as\n\nShow More\n\nthey venture to save Bean's life. Its a lot idealistic but we all need a bit of that now and again. I hope Stirling enjoys this as much as I did.\n\n21-2002\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member missmath144\n\nThis is the story of the Spaz, a boy living in a post-Apocalyptic world -- colorless and virtually lawless. He meets (while robbing) an old man called Ryter, a feral boy called Little Face, and a Prove (improved species) from Eden. Eden is where the improved people live, where the sky is blue and\n\nShow More\n\nthere is green grass on the ground. Ryter, Little Face and Prove help Spaz get through forbidden territory to see his sister Bean before she dies. Not only did I enjoy the story, but I really enjoyed the reader. He has such a soothing voice that I kept falling asleep, but that's okay since I was listening to it at night for just that reason, and I just had to start the tapes over many times before actually completing the book, even though it was only 3 cassettes.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member coriblake\n\nI loved this book! The exact time period is unknown however we know the book takes place far into the future when even in the back times, people traveled in flying cars. This is a time when those living in the urb live in fear everyday. They live in fear of being cut off, having no place to live,\n\nShow More\n\nor in fear of the mind probe. They are just normal and really want to be like those living in Eden who are genetically perfect. Eden is perfect in every way. The problem is, if you're a normal, you will never be allowed into Eden. If you are a proov living in Eden, you will never mix with the normals. This is the story of a normal; a young man named Spaz who travels across forbidden lands to find his sister who is deathly sick. Along the way, Spaz gets help from some unexpected individuals to lead him to his destination. Will Spaz get to see his sister one last time? Read The Last Book in the Universe and find out.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member SamuelW\n\nMost people, upon picking up The Last Book in the Universe, would be instantly intrigued by the summary provided on the back cover. “Why bother reading when you can just shoot all the excitement straight into your brain?” On this intriguing note, I expected a thought-provoking journey into this\n\nShow More\n\nvery interesting concept. Once I actually started reading, I found that the issue of reading versus probing features less prominently in the book than I expected. It was, however, still a thought-provoking journey. The Last Book in the Universe is a book that explores issues of human suffering, leadership, struggle and what it means to live forever. Unusually deep for a book aimed at younger readers, it succeeds spectacularly at being everything it attempts to be. There is no point trying to judge this book as a work of mid/late teenage fiction, because it isn’t one, and although Philbrick hasn’t produced one of the finest adventure stories ever written, in this novel he has achieved what matters.\n\nThe world created in The Last Book in the Universe is rich and realistic; a place where the colours fill readers’ heads and control their emotions, from the wretched greys of the latches to the lush paradise of Eden. Philbrick has also done a very good job of thinking outside the box. Readers should prepare themselves to learn a whole new vocabulary of futuristic slang, including phrases like ‘cut my red’, ‘takvee’ and ‘the Big Shake’. One of the most incredible things about Philbrick’s books has always been his ability to write brilliantly in the first person from a different character every time. It almost seems as if he can pour himself inside a character, tell himself, “Today I am Spaz,” and start writing, and not once does the character falter. It is this skill that sets Philbrick’s books apart from the rest.\n\nOne that is sure to hold a special place in the hearts of writers and English teachers, The Last Book in the Universe is touching and inspiring – a fantastic introduction into deeper reading for younger bookworms.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member cejerry97\n\nThis book is about a young boy named Spaz who lives in a futuristic world. The world is divided into separate places, where people of different social hierarchies live. Spaz finds a friend named Ryter and the two go on an adventure to find Spaz's sister, who is sick and might be in danger of dying.\n\nShow More\n\nAlong their journey, Ryter and Spaz meet many different friends and visit different places, such as \"Eden,\" which is forbidden to \"normals\" and only allowed for \"proovs.\" This book would probably be a good read for middle schoolers.\n\nType: Chapter book, intermediate\n\nGenre: Science fiction\n\nIllustrations: none\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member SHeineke\n\nThe main character, Spaz, suffers from seizures and lives in a world seperating the genetically improved humans, \"proovs\" who live in Eden from the others who live in the Urb. The story takes place after the \"Big Shake\" or world wide destruction and revolves around Spaz, his quest to find and help\n\nShow More\n\nhis foster sister who is quite ill., and his relationship with an old man who is the last writer (and thinker) in the Urb.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member katiejanelewis\n\nWhat if you could not read? What if your friends couldn't read? Your parents? What if books don't even matter?\n\nWhat if the world looked nothing like it does today?\n\nThe Last Book in the Universe raises these questions and so many more. Our journey is led by Spaz, an orphan living on the outskirts of\n\nShow More\n\nthis futuristic dystopia of a city. Spaz discovers that his sister (who lives in a different part of town) is dying. Though it will be risky, Spaz (and a few other characters) set off to see his sister.\n\nThis adventurous tale is exciting, but also raises many questions.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member smendel18\n\nThis was an amazing book! I truly enjoyed it. This book could be used for upper grades as a read aloud or as an assigned reading. It takes you into an entirely new futuristic world. The \"big shake\" changed the way we live, and it takes you way into the future. I highly recommend this book!\n\nLibraryThing member aelambert\n\nThis book is about what happens in the future of the world after a big earthquake. The main character, Spaz, learns a lot about life as he travels to save his adoptive sister. He meets new people and utilizes resources to help his sister.\n\nLibraryThing member vabrazzolotto\n\nSpaz lives in a future world that has been disrupted by an earthquake, \"The Big Shake.\" He lives with adoptive parents who maek him leave because he has epislepsy. The only place people can go to be safe/happy is Eden, but to get in there one must be genetically improved. These people are called\n\nShow More\n\nProovs. Spaz receives a message from Bean, his adoptive parents daughter, telling him that she has The Blood Sickness, now known as leukemia. Spaz meets several people and they go get Bean and journey to Eden. They get Bean into Eden and she is cured. They are thrown out and Bean retuens home. Bean is told that he has the last book in the universe because he has knowledge of the presence.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member mcdarden\n\nAwesome book to have students read in literacy centers. Students can discuss the story, give their own input, and listen to other students in puts.\n\nLibraryThing member torinotbarbie\n\nSpaz has never seen green grass, trees, or blue sky. His world is gray- the ground, the concrete cubicles he lives in, and most of all, the sky.\n\nDoing what he has to in order to survive, Spaz doesn’t want to hear about the” back times” before the Big Shake, when people read books and everyone\n\nShow More\n\nlived rich.\n\nOne day the old man Spaz is sent out to rob not only welcomes him into his hovel, but begins to tell him things. Things he doesn’t want to know about. The old man says he is a writer, and that everyone has a story to tell. Soon Spaz will find himself on an adventure he never wanted to have, and will discover that he, too, has a story to write.\n\nStrengths of the book include the dialog, which is rich with creative slang and acronyms, as well as vivid descriptions of the setting, that invoke images of those found in George Orwell’s 1984. The main character, Spaz, is also likeable, although hardened and ignorant.\n\nSome of the characters in this book appear to be less –than- believable, and some situations are a bit predictable. However, most readers who enjoy Science Fiction should find the novel entertaining, as well as thought provoking. This novel would be a good addition to any middle or high school library collection.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member srrush\n\nThe last book in the universe is a great book for children with alot of adventure involved. It's the story of a child and an old man going on a journey to save the boy's little sister from illness. Throughout all their obstacles, the young boy learns many things from the old man and in the end they\n\nShow More\n\nare reunited with the little sister.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member cemccamy\n\nThis post-apocolyptic story is set in a time when no one reads books. Corruption is everywhere. Spaz is told that his sister is dying and tried to save her.\n\nLibraryThing member meotoole\n\nI thuoght this book was very interesting. It has a lot of differnt hings going on so that the reader is always guessing what is coming next.\n\nLibraryThing member kefoley\n\nThis books was a fun read. It was a different world where books did not exist and people were not all the same. Spaz is living off the street in a gang and finds out that one of his loved one's is in trouble. HIm and two other characters go on a dangerous adventure to try and save her.\n\nLibraryThing member mcbalducci\n\nThis book was very interesting! i was happy that i could not predict the book until the very end. This book could be used in upper level elementary for science unit.\n\nLibraryThing member Nmaki\n\nanother great book. highly reccomend it.\n\nLibraryThing member fnborries\n\nThis book to me seemed like a difficult book for children to read unless they have a wonderful imagination. I found it very hard for me to read. It is a science fiction book which you want to encourage any reading to students. I found it difficult because of the new language. It is about a boy\n\nShow More\n\nnamed Spaz who is on a mission to find his little sister because she is sick.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member setonhansen\n\nThis book is about a boy living in the future where there are no books. He has to travel out of the area he lives in in order to go home to see his sister. The only thing is he is forbidden from going in that or any other area he is not currently living in.\n\nLibraryThing member eastahlhut\n\nThis is a great book for 4th graders and above. It is a book set in the future where there are no books anymore. No one knows how to write anymore either. From the beginning, I found this book very hard to read. I would recommend this to students who have a wild imagination or are really into\n\nShow More\n\nscience fiction books.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member bloftis\n\nThis book tells the story of Spaz, a young boy in the distopian future, and his quest to save his younger sister. Spaz encounters two different worlds, one a utopia of genetically improved humans, and the other a dark, ugly, and heavily censored world.\n\nThe book is very effective through its first\n\nShow More\n\nperson point of view of Spaz and his adventures. In many ways, this book seemed to be a young adult combination of Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, dealing with ideas of censorship, distopias, and the possibility of genetically improved humans. While an exciting read, the book also particularly emphasizes the importance of books, stories, and the written word.\n\nShow Less"
