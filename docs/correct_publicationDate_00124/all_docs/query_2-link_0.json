Whether you are a young reader or an adult, there is sure to be a story that draws you in, challenges your thinking, and peaks your imagination.\n\nRodman Philbrick wrote his first novel when he was sixteen. His themes often present adventurous stories of individuals facing difficult challenges that must be overcome.\n\nHis first novels were for adults–thrillers, mysteries, detective stories, medical thrillers. It wasn’t until later that he wrote his first book for young readers, Freak the Mighty, that eventually led to the movie, The Mighty.

His stories and engaging characters help spur discussions that relate to challenges in student lives, and help foster a love for reading.\n\nWith more than 40 published books to his credit, plus numerous short stories written as early as sixth grade, Rodman always loved to read and write. It started when he and his young brothers would act out stories they read in books.\n\nHis acclaim as a writer is exceptional and his awards and honors are numerous. Most notably, his detective stories for adults have been recognized by the prestigious Shamus Award for being among the best detective stories published. His books for young people have received countless honors, including the much sought after Newbery Honor. For a full list click on the Awards page.\n\nPrompted by his publisher, in addition to publishing under his own name, he has also published under the pen names of William Dantz, W. R. Philbrick, and Chris Jordan.\n\nWhether you are new to his books or already a fan, spend some time exploring a book you haven’t yet read. Sit back then and let the adventure begin!"
