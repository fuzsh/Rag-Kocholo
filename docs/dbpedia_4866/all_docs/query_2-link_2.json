GeorgHH • talk\n\nThank you for providing images to the Commons. Please keep in mind that images and other files on the Commons must be under a free license and should be useful to the Wikimedia projects. To allow others to use your files, some additional information must be given on the description page. Most importantly:\n\nDescribe what it is about in a short sentence. (What does the image show?)\n\nState the author and the date of creation. If you made it yourself, say so explicitly. If it is from another Wikipedia user, link to the person's local user page. Best use CommonsHelper\n\nIf you did not create the file yourself, state the source you got it from.\n\nAdd a copyright tag - images without an appropriate license tag will be deleted.\n\nAdd the image to one or more gallery pages and/or appropriate categories, so it can be found by others. To find out where an image belongs, you can use CommonsSense.\n\nIf you copied the file from another wiki, please copy all information given there and say who uploaded it to that wiki. Use CommonsHelper.\n\nIt is recommended to use Template:Information to put that information on the description page. Have a look at Template talk:Information for details of the use of this template.\n\nYou can edit the description page and change the text. Uploading a new version of the file does not change the description of the file.\n\nPlease add as much information as possible. If there is not sufficient information, the file may have to be deleted. For more information, follow the Commons:First steps guide. If you need help or have questions, please ask at the Help desk.\n\nThank you.\n\nThis message was added automatically by Filbot, if you need some help about it, ask its master (Filnik) or go to the Commons:Help desk. --Filnik\n\nYou've uploaded a derivative work We're sorry, but Image:Uhlspo10.png has been marked as a copyright violation. Wikimedia Commons only accepts free content, that is, images and other media files that can be used by anyone, for any purpose. Photographs of copyrighted works are also subject to the same copyright, and therefore this photo must unfortunately be considered non-free.

Please keep in mind that images uploaded to Commons should be useful to all users of Wikimedia projects. This is possible only if the images can be found by other people.\n\nTo allow others to find the images you uploaded here, the images should be in some place that can be found by navigating the category structure. This means that you should put the images into appropriate topic pages, categories, optionally galleries, or both of them (see Commons:Categories). To find good categories for your images, the CommonSense tool may help.\n\nYou can find a convenient overview of your uploaded files in this gallery.\n\nThe important point is that the images should be placed in the general structure somewhere. There are a large number of completely unsorted images on Commons right now. If you would like to help to place some of those images where they can be found, please do!\n\nThank you.
