        "text": "Professional career\n\nProfessional Billiard Player, businessman: Staton was regarded by others in the billiard circuit as one of the classiest gentlemen on the tournament pool circuit. He started playing pool at 22 years of age. As his game developed, he used his pool earnings to support his business enterprises. When he became an accomplished pocket billiards player, Staton made several appearances on \"Wide World of Sports\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\" and was interviewed by David Frost. Bill Staton also appeared on the TV show \"I've Got A Secret\". His \"secret\" was the ability to sink a full rack of balls into the pockets. At the conclusion of the show on live TV he performed this trick shot of sinking all the balls in the pockets of the Pool Table with only one hit. He performed trick shots in the Academy Award-winning film, The Color of Money, and is also credited with giving Rudolph \"Minnesota Fats\" Wanderone his nickname.\n\nSome of Staton's titles include the World Championship One-pocket Tournament and the Stardust Open One-pocket Championship in Las Vegas, and he won the Virginia State Pool Championship five times, as well as other tournaments. In the 1960s he won the European Billiard Championship.\n\nAn avid golfer, Staton played with Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, and so he moved to golfing haven Myrtle Beach after developing a love for the game.\n\nStaton was inducted into the One-pocket Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nHe died at his home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
