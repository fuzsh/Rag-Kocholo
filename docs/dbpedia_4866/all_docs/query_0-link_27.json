        "text": "In light of the fact the Blues are trialing a Dutchman called Gus I am now asking for your favorite trialists. I am sure Wayne Grays cousin will win but I am looking for some players that came and went leaving us with some comedy moments.\n\nI am going for the Yugoslavian bloke, central defender who came, looked good and then disappeared again a few seasons ago.\n\nDoes anyone remember Rupert Pif, the barrel-chested ex-France u-21 left winger who hooked up with the side back in 2001?\n\nNot my favourite though, that was Byron Bubb or Stephane Pounewatchy.\n\nI thought Nikola Jozic was alright. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeast.\n\nI had a soft spot for Abderrahmane Mssassi though. He looked to have a fair bit about him in the games I saw and I thought he was worth a years deal to be honest.\n\nI saw Leon Britton play for the reserves away at Millwall about 6-7 years ago and thought he was brilliant. He completely ran the show, and I was really excited that we might sign him.\n\nImagine my surprise when our then manager (Rob Newman) was quoted in The Echo saying none of the trialists were better than what we already had! Him and Maher would have made a very impressive midfield.\n\nI thought Nikola Jozic was alright. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeast.\n\nI think that's the guy DtS was referring to..... The best trialist we never signed that bloke... awesome he was!!\n\nDarren Blewitt. He came. He played. He Blew it.\n\nThank you, Thank you. I'm here all week.\n\nHate to be picky but he wasn't a trialist, we signed him on loan for the end of the 04/05 season (along with Luke Guttridge I believe) but he didn't play a game."
