Go through them and prepare a short speech about humanity.\n\nHumanity Speech in English\n\nHumanity can be defined as a basic quality that differentiates human beings from other living organisms. Simply put, it is a trait that is expected to be exposed by humans. Humanity is a collective term to represent human beings’ love, affection, compassion, and concern for others. When given a choice between being right and being kind, a person with humanity chooses to be kind without much contemplation. The unconditional love for all human beings is the foundation of humanity. It eliminates the consciousness of gender, religion, caste, nationality, etc. from the minds of the people and connects everyone under one umbrella term – ‘humans’.\n\nHumanity is not just about the actions that are happening between human beings; it’s also about how human beings interact with the whole world. Who are ‘humanitarians’? Any person who seeks to promote the welfare of all human beings is called a humanitarian. Humanitarians are the greatest blessings to a nation. The purity of our planet has been sustained with the presence of numerous great humanitarians in it. Some of the popular humanitarians are Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Oskar Schindler and Malala Yousafzai.\n\nPeople all over the world celebrate the spirit of humanity on World Humanitarian Day. World Humanitarian Day promotes human welfare, and honours everyone who engages in humanitarian services in their lives. It is a commemoration of the day in 2003 when twenty-two workers were killed in a bombing at the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\n\nSpeech on Humanity and Kindness\n\nHonesty and kindness are the two ways of expressing love to humankind. By being born as humans, we are gifted with the advantages of perceiving, thinking, choosing, and acting according to our own objectives to make our lives better. We are provided with the power to enjoy our lives. Like that, everyone around us also enjoy the same power. We have to realise the fact that we are all different souls living on the same planet. So finding happiness by stealing from others is never the course of action for human beings. We have to use the advantages of being human for the goodness of our lives and for others. Such deeds mark the dawn of kindness. Being kind is not just about bringing direct effects on others; it has a positive impact on ourselves as well.\n\nHumanity and kindness are two inevitable characteristics required for the progress of the human race. However, as the living conditions of human beings are changing day by day, the purity of humanity has been expelled from the hearts of many. Replacing humanity with money, fame, and power marks the beginning of the human catastrophe. Humanity is not about serving humans; it means serving our nature. Like the words said by Ronald Reagan, “We can’t help everyone, but everyone can help someone.” By doing so, the smile of humanity could be brought to everyone. Let’s be humane and turn the world into a wonderful place.\n\nMotivational Speech about Humanity\n\nHumanity is the path to happiness. A person performing deeds with concern for humanity will be the happiest person on this planet. Serving people with humanitarian considerations provides a lot of satisfaction to a person’s life. The real happiness of a person is the result of inner satisfaction. A person doesn’t have to be wealthy in order to show qualities of humanity. Any person can show their concern for the world through simple acts of kindness and love.\n\nHave you heard the term ‘humanitarian crisis’ before? A humanitarian crisis can be defined as an emergency situation that threatens the well-being of an entire community or a large group of people. Some of the major causes of humanitarian crises include global warming, pollution, lack of biodiversity, the war between nations, the outbreak of diseases, etc. A majority of such crises is happening as an aftereffect of people’s negligence toward humanity.\n\n“You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate – the unloved and the unnatural!” These are the final words from the final speech in Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator. With the power of humanity within us, let’s comprehend the truth behind the statement – ‘We rise by lifting others.’\n\nTop Quotes to Use in a Speech on Humanity"
