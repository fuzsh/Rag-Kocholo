Questions and Answers Pdf, Notes, Summary Class 10 English Karnataka State Board Solutions to help you to revise the complete Syllabus and score more marks in your examinations.\n\nThere’s a Girl by the Tracks! Questions and Answers, Notes, Summary\n\nQuestion 1.\n\n“It’s a regular scene”. What was regular about the scene? (Para -1)\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn a most populated metropolis like Mumbai the commuters (one who travels to the workplace daily) were more. Evening times they are hurried to go back home, so they rushed to board the trains. If they missed the particular train, they are in trouble and get late to reach their home. So it is a regular scene for those people. No one has time to think about others.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\n“Roma Talrej a tried to settle into a corner near the door in the train”, was she right in doing this? What would you have done, if you were there?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, it’s always better to avoid standing near the door. If I were in her place, the first thing I would try to do would be to move into the compartment, away from the door. However, it’s easier said than done. The trains are so jam-packed that movement is almost impossible and quite often we expose ourselves to grave danger.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\n“There’s a girl by the tracks”, the voices cried out.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe voices came from the passengers who stood at the door Of the train which was coming from the opposite direction.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nBaleshwar was impulsive in taking a decision because “there is a girl by tracks!”\n\n(Fill in the blank appropriately), (para-3)\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nThe dictionary says ‘callous’ means ‘unconcerned’. In this situation, who do you think was ‘callous’ towards the accident?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe people who saw the scene that Roma had Men on the tracks. Though they had seen, they did not volunteer to help her. They were considered as callous towards the accident.\n\nQuestion 6.\n\n‘Baleshwar rushed to help the girl”. His movement has been described with verbs like ‘shoved’. Identify two more such verbs/ verbal phrases in paragraph (5).\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe two more verbal phrases are\n\n1) Jumped off and\n\n2) landed on\n\nShare your Responses\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nWhere did Baleshwar find Roma at last?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAt last Baleshwar found Roma by the side of the tracks between the two stations approximately five kilometers apart.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\n“Behenji, aap teek hai ?” But there was no response and no help in sight. Why was it so? Read paragraph 6 and answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRoma had fallen by the railway track while commuting by an electric train and Baleshwar also had jumped off a still-moving train after pulling the chain. Both the trains had moved on with the rest of the passengers as if nothing untoward had happened. Since it was the railway tracks somewhere between two stations which were five kilometers apart in Thane district, there weren’t people around and there was no help in sight. Roma couldn’t answer the question as she had blacked out after the fall because of a gash in the head.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nFill in the table with appropriate details.\n\nAnswer:\n\nName Age Education State they belong to Profession Reasons for boarding the train Roma 21 years Graduate Maharastra Working in call centre back to home Baleshwar Mishra 20 years High School drop out Uttar Pradesh (U.P) Un employed back to home\n\nShare your Responses :\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nWho volunteered to help Baleshwar?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe middle-aged tempo-truck driver who spoke Gujarati volunteered to help Baleshwar.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\n“Roma stirred and her eyes fluttered open”. What could have made her react so?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRoma was shifted to back of the tempo truck with Baleshwar, she lay on the seat. When the vehicle moved unsteadily it made her stir and her eyes fluttered open.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nSome details of Roma’s brother are given in Paragraph 14. Read and fill in the columns appropriately.\n\nAnswer:\n\nName Job Place Vehicle Dinesh Talreja Marketing job Ulhasnagr motorcycle\n\nShare your Responses:\n\nQuestion 1.\n\n“Oh, I couldn’t thank him”, Balesh-war thought. Who do you think he couldn’t thank ?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBaleshwar couldn’t thank the tempo truck driver because he was busy to admit Roma to the hospital and spoke with Dr. Anil Agarwal.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nWhy did Baleshwar revisit the spot where Roma had fallen?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBaleshwar revisited the spot to find out Roma’s belongings. Dinesh told him that her mobile phone and handbag were missing.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nBaleshwar got some assurance from a railway employee.\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen he was looking for her belongings at the spot, where Roma had fallen a railway employee assured that Roma’s belongings had been found already found.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nRoma said, “I think it’s astonishing”. What was astonishing?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe manner in which she had been rescued was astonishing. According to Roma, it was astonishing because a stranger would jump off a train and risk his life for her. She was also a stranger to him.\n\nThink About The Text\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nSome incidents relating to Roma Talreja are given below. Put them in the right order.\n\na. Roma lost her foothold.\n\nb. The train hurtled ahead.\n\nc. Roma was thrown out of the coach\n\nd. Roma was jumped, between two women.\n\ne. Roma panicked.\n\nAns :\n\nb\n\nd\n\na\n\ne\n\nc\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nBaleshwar jumped into action to save the girl. His actions in doing so are given in a jumbled manner. Set them in the right sequence, as in the text.\n\na. Baleshwar crossed the track\n\nb. He carried the girl.\n\nc. He saw the girl bleeding\n\nd. He requested motorists to help him\n\ne. He prayed silently.\n\nAns:\n\nc\n\ne\n\nb\n\na\n\nd\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nWrite briefly about the personal details such as qualification and profession of Roma Talreja and Baleshwar Mishra after discussion with your classmates.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRoma Talreja is 21 years old, B.Com., graduate from Pune. She is working as a call centre executive for two years. She loved her job, talking and connecting to customers and making new friends. She is feeling happy and active. Baleshwar Mishra is 21 years old, high school drops out. He is tall and thin youngster from Mirzapur, UP, he is unemployed recently came to Mumbai. In Mumbai, he is living with his two elder brothers and hunting a job, but his effort is not fruitful.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\n“Take the girl to Airoli”, suggested the cop. But Baleshwar disagreed. Why did he do so?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAiroli was at least 10 kilometers away and Baleshwar knew of a small hospital at a closer place. Moreover, Roma, who was bleeding, was unconscious and Baleshwar must have considered each minute crucial. So he disagreed with the suggestion given by the cop.\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nSome incidents mentioned in paragraph 12 are given in a jumbled order below. Ar¬range them sequentially,\n\na. The on-duty physician advised Baleshwar to take Roma to a nearby hospital.\n\nb. Baleshwar and Roma Telreja arrived at a small hospital.\n\nc. The nurses in the hospital helped Baleshwar to take the young woman in.\n\nd. The hospital lacked the facility and personnel to treat Roma.\n\nAnswer:\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\na\n\nQuestion 6.\n\nWas Baleshwar right in asking Roma her name while she lay in a critical condition? Justify your answer.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, he had to know who she was so that he could inform her near ones. He had done his best. But there were other things which only family members could decide on. So it was imperative that Baleshwar make Roma talk to get the required piece of information.\n\nQuestion 7.\n\n“Baleshwar had a good memory”. Do you agree with this ? Give examples to support your view.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, I agree with this, when Baleshwar asked her whom should he inform, for that Roma said her brother Dinesh and his phone number. There is no time to write, he memorized that number and called him. This incident shows that Baleshwar had a good memory.\n\nQuestion 8.\n\nThe doctor at the Divine Multi-Speciality hospital admitted Roma without any formalities. What made him do so ?\n\nAnswer:\n\nOn seeing the head injury, the doctor must have decided that the girl needed immediate attention. Though the injury turned out to be less serious than what it was feared to be, there was no way for the doctor to know that before an examination. Moreover, irrespective of the extent of the injury, the fact remained that Roma had been bleeding for quite some time. So the doctor, who did not stand on formalities, but cared for human beings, admitted Roma without any formalities so that immediate treatment could be given. If we have more doctors like the doctor at the Divine Multi-Speciality Hospital, many lives can be saved.\n\nQuestion 9.\n\nIf Baleshwar had not come forward to help Roma, what would have happened to her?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThere are many possibilities. The worst possibility is that Roma could have bled to death even though the head injury was not severe, with no one either spotting Roma or everyone being indifferent to Roma. A more optimistic viewpoint at the possibility of another passer-by helping Roma and Roma being saved by the kind gesture of that passer-by. However, there is also the possibility of Roma being handicapped or paralyzed for life, even if she were to get help because of the time lapse between the accident and the time of treatment.\n\nQuestion 10.\n\nHow did the truck driver help Baleshwar?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe truck driver was also a selfless, kind-hearted man. He helped Baleshwar in taking Roma to a nearby hospital. When it was known that Roma had to be taken toa bigger hospital, he continued to help Baleshwar. He lent Baleshwar his cell phone so that Roma’s people could be informed. After there was no more need of his help, he quietly moved away without waiting for words of gratitude or appreciation. It’s people like Baleshwar and the driver who make us believe in the goodness of human beings.\n\nQuestion 11.\n\nBaleshwar felt that the people of Mumbai were afraid. What were they afraid of, according to his opinion?\n\nAnswer:\n\nPeople of Mumbai were afraid of getting involved. They were afraid that if they helped accident victims, they would get trapped in the courts or with the police.\n\nQuestion 12.\n\nThe Dalai Lama says, “Love and Compassion are the true religions to me. But to develop this, we do not need to believe in any religion”. Does this relate to the lesson “There is a Girl by the Tracks”? How? Discuss it with your friends.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, Dalai Lama’s sayings are related to this lesson. Here Baleshwar didn’t know the religion of Roma when he decided to help her. Really to love and show concern to the people do not depend on religion. Here Baleshwar had real love, compassion, and concern about human beings. This is the true religion. In this aspect, it relates to Dalai Lama’s sayings.\n\nEnrich Your Vocabulary:\n\nTask -1: Verbs related to different actions are given below. Pick them and put them in their respective columns.

The force with which he fell could be surmised from the fact that part of the sole of his rubber slipper was torn off. Fortunately, there was no real damage though a burst of pain shot up his ankle. However, Baleshwar ignored his own pain to go in search of the fallen girl.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nWhat does the phrase ‘treading water’ mean? Who is said to be treading water? Why?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe phrase ‘treading water’ is an idiom. Someone who is treading water is not doing anything to make progress. Here Baleshwar is said to be treading water because his job hunt had proved fruitless.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nWhy did Baleshwar want to thank the truck driver?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAs Baleshwar stood on the road holding the bleeding girl in his arms, no one helped him take her to the hospital. Just when he had begun to lose hope, a tempo-truck pulled over and, its driver, a middle-aged man who spoke Gujarati, stepped out and helped Baleshwar take her to the hospital. But before Baleshwar could thank him for the noble deed, the man had disappeared, having done his duty.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nWhat did Baleshwar Mishra do as soon as he saw the girl lying by the tracks?\n\nAnswer:\n\nOn seeing the girl by the tracks, Baleshwar immediately pulled the red emergency chain of the train. As the train slowed, he asked the other passengers to come with him to help the girl. No one came forward. Then Baleshwar bravely jumped off the still-moving train and rushed towards the girl.\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nHow did the doctors at Divine Multi-Specialty Hospital treat Roma?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Medical Director of the hospital saw the extent of Roma’s injuries and immediately admitted her to the ICU without any paperwork. X-rays were taken and the doctors found that she needed surgery. She was taken care of very well and recovered soon.\n\nQuestion 6.\n\nAfter Roma’s recovery, what did she say about Baleshwar?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRoma was amazed to hear about the manner in which she had been rescued. She wondered how a stranger could jump off a train and risk his life for her. She could not imagine what would have happened to her if Baleshwar had not been there. She felt that she could never repay him for what he had done.\n\nAnswer the following questions in 5-6 / 8-10 sentences each:\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nHow did the two hospitals respond to Roma when she was taken there?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt’s heartening to see that the hospitals didn’t respond in a disgraceful manner. Sometimes even hospitals are indifferent to accident victims and refuse to help. But, fortunately for Roma, if the first hospital gave her first aid, the bigger hospital offered treatment without standing on formalities. However, one question stands unanswered. Why did Baleshwar have to take Roma in the same truck to the next hospital? Shouldn’t the first hospital have arranged for an ambulance? Luckily Roma survived. But the story could have been different if her injury had been of a more serious nature. That is why it’s necessary that we, as citizens of India, impress upon our government the need to revamp the legal implications of helping an accident victim.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nHow did Baleshwar save Roma?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAs soon as Baleshwar saw a girl lying by the side of the tracks, he pulled the chain, jumped off the train, and ran back to where she had fallen. He found her unconscious, with a gash in the head. He carried the bleeding girl across the tracks. But, even after he reached this road, no one stopped to help him. Fortunately, a tempo truck driver helped Baleshwar take the girl, whose name he learn’t was Roma when she regained consciousness for a brief while, to a nearby hospital. On coming to know that the hospital lacked the required equipment and personnel to treat the girl, the truck driver took them to another bigger hospital, the Divine Multi-Speciality Hospital at Ghansoli. The doctor admitted her immediately without standing on formalities and gave her first aid. As the doctor said, although the injury was not of a very serious kind, if no one had bothered to help Roma, she could have bled to death.\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nAccording to the Dalai Lama, ‘Love and compassion are the true religions’.\n\nHow does this relate to the lesson ‘There’s a Girl by the Tracks!’?\n\nOR\n\nThe Dalai Lama says, “Love and compassion are the true religions to me. But to develop this, we do not need to believe in any religion.”\n\nHow can this be related to the lesson ‘There’s a Girl by the Tracks!’? Justify.\n\nAnswer:\n\nBy caring for a total stranger Baleshwar shows that his religion is of love and compassion. When all the other passengers remained inactive, Baleshwar jumped out of the moving train so as to reach the girl by the tracks before it was too late to help her. In spite of being an uneducated and unemployed youth, Baleshwar showed more refinement than all the others in the train. He hurt himself and went through a lot of hardship as he carried the girl across the tracks and ran looking for help. After many motorists had driven away showing no concern for the grievously injured girl, a tempo-truck driver showed the same nobility as Baleshwar and helped him get medical help for the girl. Thus we see that two gentlemen who save the life of a girl show that there is still goodness in humanity.\n\nRead the following extracts and answer the questions given below them:\n\nQuestion 1.\n\n“Now he was treading water, and had resigned himself to the fact that he was running out of options.”\n\na) What does the phrase ‘treading water’ mean?\n\nb) Who is referred to here?\n\nc) Why is he said to be ‘treading water’?\n\nAnswer:\n\na) Someone who is treading water is not doing anything to make progress.\n\nb) Baleshwar.\n\nc) He is said to be treading water because his job hunt had proved fruitless.

Summary in English\n\n‘ There’s a Girl by the Tracks ! ” is the extract taken from an English Journal. This is written by a well-known writer Deven Kanal in English. This is one of the terrible accidents which W happened at Mumbai suburban station in Thane district, which borders Mumbai. One evening at 6.32 pm an electric train halts at a station. As usual the station is full ofpeople and everybody hurried to catch the train. At Mumbai this is the regular scene because it is India s most populated Metropolitan city. Roma Talreja a 21 years old call centre executive tried to settle into a corner near the door of an electric train As it was very rush and already the train was already moving fast, Roma jammed between other women.\n\nShe tried to find some space to stand safely but all of a sudden she got pushed, she was not able to manage herself to standfirmly. Her weak and shaky foot lost their grip and her hands tried to hold the steel railing above, but finding only air she was thrown out of the coach. She fell on the ground more than a meter below. She was knocked senseless. The low sound of her fall was silenced by the loud sound of the train. No one observed her fall. Another train was coming in the opposite direction passed beside this train.\n\nBaleshwar Mishra, twenty years old standing near the door couldn’t believe his eyes. He saw the fall of Roma fall. Wearing a black Salwar- Kameez, her body was lying next to the tracks. Those who saw this scene screamed and the people cried out “There’s a Girl by the Tracks!”. Quickly Baleshwar went and grabbed the train s red emergency chdin and pulled it down with no hope. But luckily the train slowing down its speed comes to a stop. He saw the worried faces of the people surrounded and asked them to come and help her. But nobody came forward to help her. Baleshwarjumped off from the moving train. As he landed on the ground, a burst of pain shot up in his ankle, but there was no damage. His old rubber slipper s sole tom off as a result of his jumping from the train. When he got down from the train, the train again started to move and disappeared.\n\nBaleshwar started to run very fast between the tracks to find Roma. He was so far away from her. That he couldn’t see her. After running for several minutes he found her lying stretched by the side of the tracks. When he found her, he asked “Behenji, aap theek hai ? ” But there was no response and no help in sight. He could see bloodflowing out of a deep cut behind her head. Saying a silent prayer, he carried her and searchingfor a way out. He crossed through some shrubbery, and reached the road. He was seeking help from motorists but no one stopped. The day was December 10, 2010, a Friday. Roma Talreja a B.Com., graduate from Pune was working in call center as an executive for two years.\n\nShe loved her job. After her day’s duty she went to cafeteria, where she and her friends joked, laughed and made plans for the weekend. When she was returning home the accident happened. Baleshwar Mishra a lanky youngster from Mirzapur, UP, was unemployed. He had recently come to Mumbai. He is an highschool dropout, living with his two elder brothers. He was hunting for a job till that day it is not fruitful. So, he had lost his hope. That day he spent his time, had lunch and watched a movie with his friend. When he was returning home, thinking about his future he boarded the train. The terrible accident happened, at that moment he could only think of saving a stranger s life.\n\nBaleshwar was struggling very hard to hold the blood-stained woman in his arms. Though innumerable motorists drove by, no one came forward to help him. Atlast a tempo-truck stopped. Baleshwar begged earnestly to help him, he agreed and helped. Baleshwar was quickly telling the driver what had happened. The traffic policeman arrived and suggested them to take the girl to Airoli where there is a hospital. But Baleshwar did not agree because that hospital was 10 kilometers away from that place.\n\nBaleshwar knew that there was a hospital nearby and they went to that hospital. It was a very small hospital, nurses helped to take the young woman inside the hospital. The physician gave basic First Aid to her and advised them her to take to a nearby Hospital. Baleshwar and the truck-driver carried her back into the truck. When the vehicle moved unsteadily her eyes opened slightly. Baleshwar was with her, asked her name, she managed to tell her name as Roma. Baleshwar asked her whom should he inform to. She said that her brother Dinesh and with much effort she gave his mobile number. Soon she lost her consciousness and went back into the darkness.\n\nBaleshwar took the mobile from the truck driver and informed Dinesh. When Dinesh Talreja was closing the days business, he got the call and agree to come immediately. He had marketing job at a retail shop in Ulhasnagar. Roma was admitted to Divine Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre. Dr. Anil Agarwal, the medical director, seeing the condition of Roma admitted immediately to the ICU without any paper work or formalities. He asked Baleshwar to wait until Roma’s family arrived. After this, Baleshwar noticed that he couldn’t thank the truck driver because the driver already left the place. Roma s X-rays showed that she needed only deep wounds sutures although the injuries looked severe.\n\nThere would be no lasting damages. Dr. Agarwal s opinion was that she could have bled to death if nobody helped her. Baleshwar had brought her to the hospital at the right time. Baleshwar came to meet her next morning she was still partly sedated. Dinesh told him that Roma s cell phone and handbag were missing. So Baleshwar went to the spot and was looking for her belongings. A railway employee informed that some of Roma s belongings had been found. Roma made full recovery in a few days. She was thinking about the accident and said that she could n’t imagine what would have happened if Baleshwar hadn’t been there. She was (amazed) surprised to learn of the manner in which she had been rescued.\n\nReally she was astonished that a stranger would jump off from the train and risk his life for her. She thought that-she could, never repay Baleshwar This is the real compassion and it is a great virtue. Without any expectation, Bcdeshwar did this. According to’ Baleshwar Mumbai people are afraid to help because they had the fear of getting trapped in the courts or police; If anybody asked him why he had done that, he simply said that she needed help, that day it was Roma, tomorrow it could be some other like you or me. Helping is necessary for those who needed, especially timely help will save the life. Here author’s intention is to love everybody, help the needful, that is the great virtue. It changes the world and it becomes paradise and man becomes divine.\n\nThere’s a Girl by the Tracks! Summanry in Kannada"
