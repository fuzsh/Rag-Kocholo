        "text": "In development: Be Safe: Stories from Ukraine\n\nCurrently in development, the film Be Safe: Stories from Ukraine features in-depth interviews with a range of Ukrainian citizens including neighbors, children, soldiers and priests. Told in their own words, they relay the shock of going from regular daily life to living amidst a brutal and relentless Russian campaign designed to terrorize and destroy their way of life.\n\nOutraged by the images coming out of Ukraine, California-based filmmaker Rick Ray (10 Questions for the Dalai Lama, Lynching Charlie Lynch) traveled to Ukraine to help document first-hand accounts as told by Ukrainian citizens. These individual narratives now form a mosaic of the struggles of ordinary people in Ukraine as they stand against Russian aggression. The hope is that in sharing these stories with a wide audience, the film will help broaden awareness of the war and maintain support for the people of Ukraine.\n\n“Be Safe” is in early post-production and is seeking distribution and post-production financing."
