        "text": "This essay was updated on May 4, 2023 to improve flow and comprehension. I took the time to make these updates because I view the June 29, 2019 BBC story as a precursor to the poor journalism and cultural silencing exhibited in the April 2023 story and its aftermath. I was working on my PhD when I wrote this essay, which I quickly composed with the help of two frjends who are credited at the end.\n\nMy name is Tenzin. I’m a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley’s Rhetoric Department, born to Tibetan refugees in India who weren’t formally educated past high school. I’m also a transgender person.\n\nThe internet is buzzing with an excerpt from an edited BBC interview with the Dalai Lama and journalist Rajini Vaidyanathan. Vaidyanathan brings up a 2015 BBC interview in which the Dalai Lama commented that a future Dalai Lama, if a woman, “must be very attractive, otherwise not much use.” The comment reflects a Tibetan cultural joke that was left unexplained. The Dalai Lama was being asked to discuss whether the legacy of the Dalai Lama might continue, via the process of reincarnation as observed by Buddhist Tibetans. (Identification of reincarnate lamas is a practice long cultivated and observed by Buddhist Tibetans that the Chinese government has interfered with since its colonization of Tibet, to the point of asserting that only they have the authority to recognize the next Dalai Lama.)\n\nAs a Tibetan familiar with the format of jokes in my community and how different they sound in English, I immediately knew what the Dalai Lama was saying in his 2015 interview (6:06–6:12). I could see him try and explain the humor in his comment, in which he is trying to make himself the butt of a joke about being ugly. Self-deprecatingly pointing to his face, he unsuccessfully tries to convey how any female Dalai Lama would be, “must be” attractive in comparison. Putting yourself down and complimenting others is a common Tibetan way of joking. It shows you don’t take yourself too seriously. But the joke is lost in translation, and the Dalai Lama seems not to understand how the BBC journalist is interpreting his remark.\n\nSince learning to read and write in English, I have always been watchful of the Dalai Lama’s remarks. He’s the same age as my grandmother, and when I look at him I don’t see a Nobel Peace Prize laureate or a celebrity. I see an elder with limited fluency in English and its nuances. I see a refugee who is a permanent guest in a foreign land (India), responsible for the well-being of 80,000 other Tibetan refugees in India and therefore under pressure to stay in India’s good graces. I see someone with a deep spiritual understanding who does not accept compensation for any of his talks or appearances. Someone who terminated his own political authority while other leaders seek to indefinitely extend their own political power.\n\nEarlier this week BBC journalist Rajini Vaidyanathan revisited the comment. You can see the Dalai Lama immediately launch into a retelling of the joke. Here, I want to share with you — as a Tibetan and someone familiar with the violence of misogyny and gender stereotypes — what went through my mind as I watched him make this joke.\n\nFirst, it is not appropriate for anyone to be discussing the appearance of a woman or any person as a barometer of performance. The mention of make-up shows how unaware the Dalai Lama is of the social pressures on women.\n\nNext, I could see him misunderstand why the journalist brought it up. He thinks he’s being asked to repeat the joke, to engage in something lighthearted. But no, she is asking him to reconsider his words. That doesn’t get across. He looks slightly mystified and like he doesn’t quite follow the beats of the conversation. This is where it’s helpful to keep in mind that not only is the Dalai Lama a non-native English speaker, he is a refugee. Since his youth, he has learned the welfare of his people rely on the good graces of others. He does everything with genuine sincerity and compassion, and he also (in my opinion) embodies that trait common to all refugees — he tries to please his host, to set others at ease. A refugee’s welcome can be revoked at any time. Every refugee knows this, and the Dalai Lama is no different.\n\nI am certain the Dalai Lama will clarify his remarks and offer an apology. [Update: The Dalai Lama’s office issued this statement of clarification on July 2. The quote he was asked to revisit in 2019 and 2015 goes back to a 1992 interview with Vogue magazine.]\n\n“His Holiness consistently emphasizes the need for people to connect with each other on a deeper human level, rather than getting caught up in preconceptions based on superficial appearances. This is something everyone who has the chance to meet with him recognizes and appreciates. The original context of his referring to the physical appearance of a female successor was a conversation with the then Paris editor of Vogue magazine, who had invited His Holiness in 1992 to guest-edit the next edition. She asked if a future Dalai Lama could be a woman. His Holiness replied, “Certainly, if that would be more helpful,” adding, as a joke, that she should be attractive. He was at least partially responding to the unfamiliar ambience of working with a team whose prime focus was the world of high fashion.”\n\nSource: Clarification and Context of Remarks Made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in a Recent BBC Interview. July 2, 2019.\n\nIt is a common refrain among Tibetan parents to cultivate a compassionate heart, to not be jealous or speak ill of others, to engage in right conduct and intention, and that even with all of this, the inner goodness won’t be seen if you don’t tend to your presentation. Be as clean as you can in your attire, adopt a good mood and easy manner so that others will feel happy in your presence. These are common sayings in the Tibetan diaspora, and I can see his mind switch to a philosophical mode when Vaidyanathan asks, isn’t what’s inside more important? When he answers ‘both’, he isn’t taking a moral position on character versus looks, but is rather thinking about how the onus is, at a practical level, always on the individual (or oppressed group) to make a case for themselves. He is a Tibetan, after all. If what’s on the inside is what was most important, Tibet would have genuine autonomy instead of a security checkpoint network imposed over several hundred thousand square miles. Tibetan refugees in Nepal would not be denied identity documents over the last two decades. The Tibetan language would not be at risk of becoming endangered in its own land. No, unfortunately, the material world matters.\n\nRegarding his most recent statements on the current refugee crisis, the Dalai Lama will likely issue remarks clarifying his opinion. But he will probably not think to explain what is obvious to me, though perhaps not to others who cycle through headlines and don’t know (and perhaps don’t even care) about the reality this 84-year-old refugee comes from.\n\nIt would be a game-changing event if the Dalai Lama were able to safely return to Tibet. Diaspora Tibetans call ourselves “in exile” because the vast majority of us are unable to actually get a visa to return. We cannot get in, and most of our brethren inside Tibet cannot leave. So when the Dalai Lama says refugees should receive training and education and “go back”, his words reflect the landscape of his most hopeful imagination — one where Tibetans have the option to return home, reunite with their relatives and neighbors, and help improve conditions in their communities they have dwelled painful decades away from.\n\n(The Dalai Lama’s statement in an extended version of the 2019 BBC interview about not anxiously waiting to return to Tibet reflects a polite consideration for the feelings of his host, the Indian government. By saying he will go wherever he is most useful, he can avoid entanglement in the political maneuverings between India and China. The link to the extended interview is now inaccessible, but 4:32–5:42 was the time code of the remark.)\n\nWhen I first heard his comments on Europe accepting refugees and that everyone cannot stay because Europe cannot become Muslim or African, I was very pained. On paper, the sound bite is identical to racist verbiage by far-right nationalists who barely feel the need to hide their sense of white supremacy these days. But I would ask you to consider his intention and actions of record. The Dalai Lama has repeated time and again that Muslim refugees ought to be welcomed and that Islam is a peaceful religion. Homeland is a sacred idea to him, and it is this priority that drives much of his language, to the point where it sounds like he is against migration. I read him as trying to offer a suggestion that meets multiple needs — allay the discomfort of Europeans who are clearly making a swing rightward, and promote free education and other resources for refugees.\n\nReading the July 2, 2019 statement issued by the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama clarifying and contextualizing his words in the 2019 BBC interview may help illuminate readers who lack a deep understanding of the Dalai Lama and his values.\n\n“In the same BBC interview His Holiness’s views about the current refugee and migration crisis may have been misinterpreted. He certainly appreciates that many of those who leave their countries may not wish or be able to return, and that Tibetans, who cherish the idea of returning home, would find their country irrevocably altered. However, His Holiness also understands the uncertainties and difficulties of those in countries where refugees and migrants make their new homes. What His Holiness wrote in an op-ed piece for the Washington Post, June 13, 2016, captures the essence of his views on this important issue:\n\n“It is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. As a refugee myself, I feel a strong empathy for their situation, and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them. I can also understand the fears of people in host countries, who may feel overwhelmed. The combination of circumstances draws attention to the vital importance of collective action toward restoring genuine peace to the lands these refugees are fleeing. Tibetan refugees have firsthand experience of living through such circumstances and, although we have not yet been able to return to our homeland, we are grateful for the humanitarian support we have received through the decades from friends, including the people of the United States.””\n\nSource: Clarification and Context of Remarks Made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in a Recent BBC Interview. July 2, 2019.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s visitors and audiences span the range of the world. He harbors no ill will when countries refuse his visa requests. Nor does he try to shame or condemn the many formerly colonized nations who avoid speaking up for Tibet at the United Nations and other arenas. He knows these nations’ leaders are being practical and that they don’t want to risk angering China. But he doesn’t criticize them because he has a compassionate, open outlook on the world and its many priorities and possibilities. Wherever he is allowed, he speaks a few simple words for Tibet and peace and doesn’t say anything negative if someone doesn’t want to be an ally to Tibetans.\n\nPragmatism is common to Tibetan character, and similarly part and parcel of who the Dalai Lama is (though non-Tibetans are usually only familiar with his spirituality, optimism, and ethics). He knows firsthand that refugees don’t leave their homes as a lark, and are only driven to it from dire circumstance. At the same time he knows support from neighboring countries is never guaranteed. Thousands of Tibetans died in refugee camps and walking across the Himalayas when first escaping Tibet, including my paternal grandmother. He understands the desperation, and this is what makes him be the first to suggest compromise in order to secure something, anything for a people in need.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to be the first to acknowledge what most of the world was perhaps unaware of before this week. Yes, the Dalai Lama is human. He makes mistakes. He is no stranger to pain and suffering, and he will regret having caused pain and confusion to people taken aback by his words. And I also want to note something I think the world too easily forgets.\n\nLike every person, the Dalai Lama comes from somewhere. His mother-tongue, the Tibetan language, is being systematically eradicated throughout Tibet by China. Tibetan Buddhism has vastly influenced popular culture in the West, but Tibetan self-determination is not on anyone’s mind. It is a source of anguish for many of my fellow Tibetans. It is also in my opinion a small moral failing on the part of the world that the media and public seem more interested in a clickbait headline but hardly stop to consider how fluency in English is a prerequisite to understanding much of what is going on in today’s world, as well as to being understood.\n\nI hope this incident can be an educative one, for the Dalai Lama and for this rapidly more connected world. I’d like to end with two quotes from the Dalai Lama. The first reminds me of advice my Tibetan parents gave me as I was growing up.\n\n“…a truly compassionate attitude toward others does not change even if they behave negatively. Genuine compassion is based not on our own projections and expectations, but rather on the needs of the other: irrespective of whether another person is a close friend or an enemy, as long as that person wishes for peace and happiness and wishes to overcome suffering, then on that basis we develop genuine concern for their problem. This is genuine compassion…the goal is to develop this genuine compassion, this genuine wish for the well-being of another, in fact for every living being throughout the universe.” (Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.)\n\nThe following is an excerpt from His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s statement clarifying and contextualizing the remarks he made in the 2019 BBC interview.\n\n“It is encouraging that we have seen many ordinary people across the world displaying great compassion toward the plight of refugees, from those who have rescued them from the sea, to those who have taken them in and provided friendship and support. As a refugee myself, I feel a strong empathy for their situation, and when we see their anguish, we should do all we can to help them.
