Iyer is the author of 10 books, including\n\nand\n\nHe was born in England and grew up there and in California, graduating from Oxford and traveling widely. He's more settled now, in Japan, and talked about how he's spending more time traveling inward than around the world. This is the first half of a 90-minute interview with Iyer, conducted on March 31. Iyer talks extensively about the\n\nand\n\nI'll post the second half on Monday, after I finish editing it.\n\nQ: What have you been up to over the last 12 years?\n\nA: Descending deeper and deeper into seclusion, and therefore into books, and therefore into self. When I last saw you I was here with this collection of essays but I was about to write \"The Global Soul\"so I was still pinballing around the world. Having felt that I satisfied my quota of movement, I've been spending a lot of time in stillness. I haven't moved into the last 12 years, I would say, and have been experimenting with a different kind of writing, and of reading.\n\nI know you and I always talk books, and so many of the writers I couldn't get before are now my heroes, like Alice Munro and Colm Toibin.\n\nQ: You haven't moved from Japan?\n\nA: Yes, rural Japan. And as you remember, that part of my life hasn't changed one iota -- no newspapers, no TV, no high-speed Internet, no bicycle, no car. It's almost like living in a monastery. For months on end, I only spend my time really within four square blocks. It's luxurious. I can't imagine a better thing for me. It's also a safe distance from watching the Titanic sink ... I think if I were here, I might get a little disspirited because so many of the things out of which I make my living -- books, newspapers and magazines -- seem to be endangered species. But there I can forget all that and spend time just reading Proust and Melville and taking these big voyages through them.\n\nQ: When you say it's like living in a monastery, you're speaking from experience.\n\nA: (laughs) I am, because the rest of the time I am in the monastery. I think that experience so moved me that it just filtered into the rest of my life and I found that the greatest luxury in my life is to be without a cell phone or a laptop or a computer screen. Interesting experiment for me to be in one place.\n\nQ: How's your Japanese?\n\nA: No better (laughs). Barely better. One thing I do there every day is play pingpong with a group of very elderly retired Japanese people who are incredibly kind to me. Most of them are in their 70s and I'm the only foreigner so I'm there sort of pet. That has forced me to learn a little Japanese, even if it's only service return or out (laughs). I tell myself that it's a virtue an illiterate and all this is about being free of distractions.\n\nMy sense is right after I last saw you I wrote this book \"The Global Soul\" about how we're so surfeited with distraction, stimulation and data that the human soul seems to be crying out for the opposite. I felt that sufficiently myself that I've been trying to take myself away from data and stimulation. It's a curious thing. I'm still like you, I'm a functioning journalist, but I'm a journalist who doesn't follow the news, or who follows the news by reading Emerson and Melville rather than watching CNN. I think I'm in the position of being about a quarter-millimeter from what's happening in the world and being unable to discern, really, what's going on because it's coming at us with such intensity.\n\nQ: How does this fit in with the Dalai Lama, who you've spent a lot of time with?\n\nA. Not explicitly. Though I would say that insofar as the two poles in my life are movement and stillness, I'm very interested in those monks who move around a lot. I've written a lot about Leonard Cohen, especially in the last 12 years, and I've been writing about the Dalai Lama a lot, but I wouldn't say he's related to this because I've been writing about him since about 1985, I would say. He is an interesting example of a man who's in the political sphere who because he's taking a much longer view and seeing things against a much broader backdrop has a wisdom and a clarity that I think most of our politicians who are always campaigning don't have. So I suppose the Dalai Lama is confirming my prejudices rather than giving me useful new prejudices.\n\nQ: If you've been writing about the Dalai Lama since 1985, did you plan to do the book since 1985?\n\nA: I didn't. I'd been writing more and more and more and more articles for 18 years and then I finally thought I should think about this in a sustained way and write a book. Also I'd noticed ... in '85 he would come to New York and he'd give a press conference and three people would show up, two Tibetans and me. Most of my friends didn't know who or what he was. I never anticipated there would be such global interest, but I found more and more of my friends would say 'you've been lucky enough to spend all this time with him. What's he like? Is the hype true? How much is distorted?'\n\nI thought I would ask some of those questions because so many people are interested in him and he offers such an interesting ... like our current president, such an inclusive, non-polar view of things that I thought it was a good moment to look at his vision.\n\nQ: How did that go?\n\nA: (laughs) I learned a lot. I think at this point I only write books about questions I really want to figure out. They're indulgences, essentially. I think 'what would I like to spend five years really thinking about? What could I gain from thinking about for five years?' He is a perfect example. I do think he's one of the richer and more unexpected public figures and philosophers around and I'm lucky enough to have access to him.\n\nI'm not a Buddhist, and when he talks to non-Buddhists like us he's really offering general principles for living. A bit like even the stoics. I was just reading Marcus Aurelius and thinking he and the Dalai Lama would have a good conversation. So, tips for mental health, essentially. I felt that could only be a good thing to think about for five years.\n\nI think before, when I last saw you, I felt that I was trying to write ahead of the curve. Each of my books was aimed to anticipate the theme of the country, or a theme of the country, two years later. Now I'm probably trying write against the curve because I believe the world has speeded up much too fast, much too intensely for me to keep up with it, so maybe I'm offering a counter view rather than an anticipating view.\n\nQ: Would an example of that be your Canada book?\n\nA: Certainly I think Canada is many years ahead of the curve and still the great global pioneer. One example is that \"Global Soul\" book that came out the first month of this millennium and it was about some of the issues that we're going to have to address and I think we are addressing. Actually the Dalai Lama book came out the week Tibet was suddenly in the press with the uprising but it's not about the events of the day so much as how to make sense of the events of the day.\n\nThe first impulse is to gather as much data as possible and the second is to step as far back as you can to begin to thread those into a pattern that makes sense.\n\nQ: When you say you have access to the Dalai Lama, what does that mean? You've known him for a long time and he's comfortable around you?\n\nA: Essentially that. I stumbled, lucked into this acquaintance with him when I was 17, at a time when nobody was seeking him out. Then when he became more prominent, partly because he has such a good memory and he's such a kind person, he would always remember that my father had met him in 1960 and I'd met him thereafter. I always felt that the foundations of an easy working relationship were laid a long time ago.\n\nQ: What's he up to now?\n\nA: Trying to tell people to go to Tibet, people like us. Mostly what he's been up to for a long time is to prepare the Tibetan people for his succession and when he's no longer around. That I think has been his big challenge and one I'm not sure he's answered successfully. I don't think he ever could answer and that's how to make them non-dependent on him. He's set up a full democratic system there and done everything he can to try to essentially depose himself, but understandably after 400 years of turning to the Dalai Lama it'll take awhile for them to get out of that habit. It's interesting we've seen the same thing in Bhutan where the king deposed himself and imposed democracy on the people, who didn't want it. Nepal is moving in that direction now.\n\nQ: In fits and starts.\n\nA: (laughs) Exactly. Very fitfully. Obviously in exile Tibetans have been looking to the Dalai Lama to be the human glue, the one thing holding them together.\n\nQ: How old is he?\n\nA: 75 this year, in July. I think his health is pretty good. His stamina is amazing. Whenever he comes to Japan I travel with him for eight or nine days and I'm exhausted just from watching him go through his schedule and I'm 25 years younger than he. It goes back to your first question: I think part of the reason why his stamina is so amazing is he spends his first four hours every day in meditation. I think seeing people like him or Leonard Cohen, who is doing three-hour concerts at the age of 74 and 75, has if nothing else shown me that it's only by composing yourself and sitting still for a long, long time that you can really bring the focus and clarity to guide you when you start moving. Those two are good examples of that.\n\nQ: I was going to wait to ask you about Leonard Cohen but he keeps popping up.\n\nA: He does keep popping in.\n\nQ: Start from the beginning: What's your connection to him?\n\nA: Like many people, maybe you, I was a devotee growing up. I remember when I was 17 I went to India, really for the first time, for three months and all I had was an acoustic guitar, a very worn copy of his first album, and the dream of becoming the Indian Leonard Cohen. I would traipse along with long hair, English boarding school, and every time I'd see a beautiful Mogol garden I'd sit down and strum something horrible and try to create some moon/June terrible verse to replicate him. I was a fan for a long, long time.\n\nThen in 1995, to my delight, a magazine asked me to spend some time with him in his Zen temple where he'd gone on retreat because I had written a book about Japan and Zen. Since then, because he's such an open, generous and humble man, as his monk-ly robes would suggest, disarmingly so. It's almost shocking when people meet him how much he's left Leonard Cohen the celebrity behind. He presents himself as somebody who just wants to look after you and tend to you anonymously. He was really nice enough to keep up the connection.\n\nI reviewed his album in 2001, \"Ten New Songs,\" and I think he liked that piece. He often asked me to write, I guess the text for his Essential Leonard Cohen album and then something about his next album and the text for his recent concert program and the bio for his Web site. I think it's mostly because maybe two reasons. One is he's such a literary person at heart. As you know, he began his life as a poet and he's always hungering for a literary appreciation for his work, not just the typical music critic response. And also he doesn't know so many people who spend a lot of time in a monastery and that seems to make a connection whereby I could understand him in a certain way that made sense to him. Of course he's ... like any charismatic person who's been in the public eye for 40 years but more than most he exerts such a fascination for people. He, like the Dalai Lama in a different way, has set up such an elaborate screen of myths and projections. When people hear the words Leonard Cohen they think of all kinds of things but probably not of the monk or the poet. Maybe he was glad to have someone respond to that.\n\nQ: I was disappointed he didn't come here. Did you travel with him?\n\nA: I didn't but I saw a couple of the concerts.\n\nQ: I heard they were both artistic triumphs and rapturously received.\n\nA: Rapturous. I've never seen anything like it. I went to see the first concerts in Toronto, which were the start of the official tour, and for Leonard Cohen to return to a big arena in Canada is like the Pope to show up in St. Peter's square or whatever it's called. He only had to come out onstage and the whole place was up, and then regularly after every song. It was very touching. I've never seen such an intimate connection between an audience and a star onstage. I think that's because his skill at demystifying himself and creating that air of intimacy, even in a big arena. I thought a lot about what it is that holds people so about his work and I think there is a pitiless, unsparing honesty that very few writers in any form can conjure up. I more and more think that he is one of the enduring poets of English literature. I would put him right next to Emily Dickinson.\n\nQ: Do you think that his performing aged well? He is a spare arranger and his voice is not considered classically beautiful and maybe sounds better now than it did when he was younger.\n\nA: That's a very interesting point and makes a lot of sense to me. I think it's also that he's sitting apart from the time and that he's singing to the tune of his own drummer. I think what people respond to is a composure and a wisdom to his delivery that we're not accustomed to seeing even among his contemporaries like Bob Dylan. I think they feel that he's not trying to keep up with the moment or traffic in the latest MTV styles or playing elaborate games of that kind.\n\nHe's presenting himself almost as a monk in prayer on the stage and that cuts through some of the stuff I was saying we're so tired of. We feel more and more manipulated by image and more hostage to the moment and he's not about moment and not about image. And yes his voice, which was always a little uncertain, is now more hauntingly uncertain. When I play it in Japan my Japanese wife runs out of the room holding her ears. She says 'this is just Buddhist chanting. This is like going to a Zen temple.' (laughs) And she's right. That has a certain appeal now.\n\nThe arc of his career is so interesting. He began as the bright troubadour romantic and then in the 70s his songs were all about self-hatred and being messed up and lost and then he went into the Zen temple and came out with these very worldly songs, \"First We'll Take Manhattan,\" almost like a prophet returning to the mountaintop. I do feel, and maybe it's just my prejudice, that those years as a monk prepared him for being able to come out in the world and an extraordinary collected energy that almost no other musician can command. One reason the concerts were so successful was his transparent humility. We're not used to a performer thanking the audience over and over and not trying to hog the spotlight.\n\nQ: As far as putting him in the pantheon of poets, I've read comments from him that writing is a very painstaking process for him and he wants to make sure to get it right.\n\nA: Yes, exactly. I remember when I was staying with him in the Zen temple in this little rickety cabin on the mountainside and he had all these notebooks up there and he pointed and said those six notebooks are one song. For something like \"Halleluyah\" he wrote 80 verses and recorded four verses and he sometimes sings a version with two different ones so he's employed six out of the 80. I think that perfectionism, that absolute meticulousness that you see in his dress and his presentation of himself, means that he'll continue to make minor changes in a song even after it's recorded.\n\nHe approaches life as a poet and I think he's almost unique in the rock and roll domain in that there are many people like Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan and subsequent ones who have a great gift for poetry but are musicians first. I see Cohen as being very similar to Thomas Merton. I was just up at the monastery reading Merton and it's word for word similar but even more Emily Dickinson with those riddled quatrains where each word is so uncanny but so perfectly put together in this little jewel box that can explode in your hand. It's a very rare thing even in poetry because not much mainstream poetry is rhymed and observes so specific a rhythm as his.\n\nQ: The current Bob Dylan is revealing himself to be what he was when he was 20, a troubadour and a collector and interpreter of old folk songs. He'll reinterpret himself differently every time where Cohen will make sure to get it exactly right.\n\nA: Yes, and invested with the changes himself. When he sings \"Suzanne\" it's note for note the same as in 1967 but what you're hearing is a 75-year-old man singing a 40-year-old song of love so it instantly has a different coloration. But you're right, he's not playing games with it, he's counting on the years to speak through it. I think Dylan is the great minstrel of people when they're young and walking down the road and they don't know what's beyond the next mountain and the excitement of exploration and leaving everything behind and Cohen is about what's on the other side of the mountain. He's the only person I know in the contemporary music world who's speaking for the wisdom of the 75-year-old rather the questing nature of the 20-year-old.\n\nI was listening to some early Dylan recently from the Scorsese documentary \"No Direction Home\" and there's some early songs when Dylan was 19 and I suddenly got it and I realized when he was 19 he sounds like he's 1,000 years old and he sounds like a prophet who's come down from the mountain or forest and it's really uncanny to me now. In some ways he's gotten younger and younger as the years have gone on whereas I think Cohen is more about how we've watched him deepen and mature and go from this person singing about division and confusion to this sage who's beyond it all.\n\n--"
