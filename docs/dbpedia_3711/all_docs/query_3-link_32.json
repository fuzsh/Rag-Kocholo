        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Nobel laureate and Buddhist spiritual leader Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, will make his first journey to Birmingham on Oct. 25-26. He will give two public appearances and one private meeting for neuroscientists. The community is prepared to greet him with thousands of prayer flags and visitors are expected from around the nation.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's visit recalls appearances by former South African president F.W. de Klerk and Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 2002. All are Nobel Peace Prize recipients and their homelands have had to endure severe oppression. It also brings into sharp focus Birmingham's human rights history and the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, who received the Nobel Prize 50 years ago this past Tuesday, Oct. 14.\n\nThose common themes unite the 79-year-old civil rights activist and religious figure with Birmingham Human Rights Week. The public events occur on Sunday, Oct. 26 -- a moderated Interfaith discussion titled \"Beyond Belief\" at 9 a.m. at the Alabama Theatre, and \"An Afternoon With His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama,\" which starts at 2 p.m. at Regions Field. His will also speak at \"Neuroplasticity and Healing,\" a invitation-only session at UAB for neuroscientists that will be streamed live on YouTube.\n\nHere is more about the 14th Dalai Lama:\n\nBecoming the Dalai Lama\n\nBorn Lhamo Dhondup on July 6, 1935, in a small farming village in northeastern Tibet, the future Dalai Lama was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13 previous Dalai Lamas by identifying objects belonging to the 13th Dalai Lama (who died in 1933) as his own. \"It's mine. It's mine,\" the 2-year-old repeatedly exclaimed as he chose the objects presented to him. In 1940, he was officially installed as the 14th Dalai Lama, clothed in maroon monk's robes and his head shaved.\n\nScience and arts\n\nThe young Tenzin Gyatso (his new given name) studied logic, Tibetan culture, Sanskrit, medicine and Buddhist philosophy while taking special interest in the sciences. Scientists have embraced his insights on transformation of the human mind through meditative practices.\n\nExile to India\n\nFollowing the invasion of Tibet by China's People's Liberation Army of Tibet, the Dalai Lama became the political leader of Tibet as well as its spiritual leader. A decade of negotiations and appeals to the West yielded little but continued Chinese oppression in Tibet. The Dalai Lama, his entourage, and as many as 100,000 fellow Tibetans fled over the Himalayas in 1960 to Dharamsala, India.\n\nWhat the Dalai Lama practices and teaches\n\nThe Dalai Lama is a member of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. In his public talks, common themes are happiness, kindness, compassion, and peace and understanding among all faiths. He has written, co-authored or provided forewords for dozens of books, from practical guides to Buddhism to more esoteric subjects such as brain science.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe long and complex relationship between Tibet and China is one of power struggles mixed with scattered periods of peace. The Chinese takeover resulted in the destruction of centuries-old temples and monasteries and a death toll estimated at between 400,000 and 1.25 million Tibetans. As head of the Tibetan government in exile, the Dalai Lama has advocated for an autonomous Tibet within China, which China has rejected.\n\nIn the West\n\nThe Tibetan leader's appearances in the West have met with condemnation from the government of China, and most recently he was denied a visa to a ceremony for Nobel laureates in South Africa, a nation that awarded him the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Reconciliation and Peace in 2011. Desmond Tutu and F.W. de Klerk condemned the action. He has held private meetings with U.S. Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter.\n\nAwards, Honors and Travel\n\nUnited States, India and several European countries have bestowed awards, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize, U.S. Congressional Gold Medal and dozens of honorary doctorates. In 2007, the Dalai Lama was appointed Presidential Distinguished Professor at Emory University in Atlanta, his first university appointment. His travel schedule takes him to every corner of the globe.\n\nCelebrity followers\n\nRichard Gere (Tibet House co-founder, International Campaign for Tibet, Gere Foundation), Robert Thurman (Columbia University author and Tibetologist, father of actress Uma Thurman, Tibet House co-founder), Eva Longoria, Keanu Reeves, Jim Carrey, Sharon Stone.\n\nAt the movies\n\n\"Kundun\" (biopic directed by Martin Scorsese); \"Seven Years in Tibet\" (Brad Pitt as Heinrich Harrer); \"10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nSee the Time magazine photo essay of the Dalai Lama at home in Dharamsala, India.\n\nDALAI LAMA EVENTS:\n\nOct. 20-26. Prayer Flags at UAB. Opening reception, Oct. 22, 5-6:30 p.m., Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts.\n\nThrough Oct. 23. Free screenings of \"10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nTuesday, Oct. 21, noon, Avondale Library\n\nTuesday, Oct. 21, 6:30 p.m., Springville Road Library\n\nWednesday, Oct. 22, 6:30 p.m., East Lake Library\n\nThursday, Oct. 23, 10 a.m., Smithfield Library\n\nThursday, Oct. 23, 11 a.m., Titusville Library\n\nSaturday, Oct. 25, 9 a.m. Neuroplasticity and Healing. Live-streamed on YouTube. Norman Doidge, moderator. Initial remarks, The Dalai Lama. Presentation and Dialogue, Michael Merzenich, Edward Taub.\n\nSunday, Oct. 26, 9 am., Alabama Theatre.
