Award-winning cinematographer, writer, editor, and director Rick Ray has traveled the world to capture images of its peoples and cultures. His film introduces this country poised to become the “next big thing’ tourist destination for world travel. Rick Ray has produced numerous films on regions as diverse as Israel, Bali, Borneo, Lebanon, Syria and Iceland with titles that include Raise the Bamboo Curtain with Martin Sheen, the highly regarded The Soul of India, and the award-winning film 10 Questions For The Dalai Lama. In addition, he is founder and president of the web-based stock footage companies DVarchive.com and RetroFootage.org, and is a frequent lecturer at performing arts centers, universities and other venues including the College Endowment Association.\n\nhttps://www.rickrayfilms.com/about"
