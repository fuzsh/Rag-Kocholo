        "text": "How does one contact the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet?\n\nYou can ask director and filmmaker Rick Ray when he visits Waubonsee Community College in Sugar Grove at 11 a.m. April 2.\n\nRay, who makes travel documentaries, was filming another project in India when he realized he was relatively close to Dharamsala, where the Dalai Lama lives in a monastery.\n\n\"Why not?\" he thought.\n\n\"Ray will speak about what went into getting the interview,\" said Cherie Westfall, manager of student activities at Waubonsee. \"You don't just call the Dalai Lama. He reached one of his representatives, and when he received word about the interview, he was told he had one hour and could ask 10 questions.\"\n\nQuite appropriately, his film is called \"10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nRay will show clips of his film when he visits April 2. It will also be screened at 11 a.m. and 12:30 and 2 p.m. March 17-20 in Bodie Hall, Room 150, on the Sugar Grove campus.\n\nThe film's Web site describes it as \"part biography, part philosophy, part adventure and part politics.\" It has won awards at several film festivals, including the Australian International Film Festival.\n\nWestfall learned about Ray and his film while attending a national conference on student affairs. She was interested enough to successfully pursue him to talk to students.\n\nRay lives in California and attended the Brooks Institute of Photography, which is based in Santa Barbara and Ventura, Calif.\n\nFor details, call Westfall at (630) 466-2317.\n\nGetting closer to spring: An information meeting on the Sugar Grove Farmers Market will be at 7 p.m. March 18 at the Sugar Grove Community House, 141 Main St.\n\nThe market features local produce and products, and organizers are looking for vegetable and fruit producers, specialty crop growers, food vendors and crafters.\n\nThe market opens June 7 for its fifth season at a new location, the parking lot of the Sugar Grove village hall, 10 Municipal Drive, near Route 30.\n\nThis move from the elementary school will make it possible for the market to feature wine from local wineries. The market runs from 8 a.m. to noon Saturdays through Sept. 27.\n\nFor details, visit www.sugargrovechamber.org or call (630) 466-1014 and leave a message.\n\nSupport sports boosters: Kaneland Sports Boosters will have a trivia night fundraiser and auction from 6 to 11 p.m. Saturday at the Kane County Fraternal Order of Police Lodge, 42W635 Ke-De-Ka Road, Sugar Grove.\n\nThe boosters provide Kaneland sports teams with equipment, such as weight room machines, and the group recently purchased the new sound system for the football field.\n\nAmong items that will be available at the auction are Bears tickets and a two-week pass to the 2009 Solheim Cup, an international golf tournament that will be in Sugar Grove.\n\nGuests must be 21 or older. Tickets are $20 per person and include appetizers and beverages for the evening.\n\nFor details or to make a donation, call Melanie Kuhar at (630) 365-9003 or Phyllis Catalano at (630) 365-6773."
