        "text": "by Gereon Willamar\n\nA friend of mine who is not a Buddhist asked:\n\nI read some interesting online news that some Tibetan Buddhist people are not allowed to pray to this deity called Dorje Shugden. Why is this so? I thought Buddhism taught freedom of religious views and practices, tolerance, acceptance, love, giving, non-violence, compassion etc?\n\nGood question.\n\nWhy are Dorje Shugden practitioners not allowed to attend Dharma teachings in certain monasteries and Dharma centers all over the world?\n\nWhen teachings were conducted by resident or visiting lamas, certain Dharma centers advertised, “All are welcome.” But a sign was put up in their center saying that Dorje Shugden practitioners are not welcome. A dog would have a better chance of attending a Dharma talk in these Dharma centers!\n\nThese centers falsely claim that Dorje Shugden is a demon yet the Dharma centers’ committee members do not ask other attendees if they worship spirits or worldly gods. So, it means that shamans, black arts practitioners, spirits worshipers, worldly gods’ worshipers, etc are welcome at these Dharma centers. But they deny entry to worshipers of the enlightened Dharma Protector Dorje Shugden.\n\nA demon is described as a usually malevolent spirit that may be conjured and controlled. These Dharma centers vehemently claim that Dorje Shugden is a demon but no fire puja rituals by any Tibetan lama, including all the Dalai Lamas, could subdue this demon. How is this possible? It would be easier, spiritually and politically correct and humane to snuff out Dorje Shugden, if he was a demon, rather than enforce a ban on his practice – a ban that has brought on so much suffering to innocent Dharma practitioners. In actuality, Dorje Shugden could not be harmed nor killed because He is an enlightened Dharma protector.\n\nIn fact, many lamas have not given up on Dorje Shugden at all. Some may indeed be practicing secretly for good reasons, while others are practising openly despite living in fear for their lives, because they practice real guru devotion, compassion, and upload their commitment to Dorje Shugden’s lineage, and to protect and defend the teachings of Lama Tsongkapa. Some of these great lamas include Kyabje Zemey Dorje Chang, H.E. Denma Gongsar Rinpoche, Lama Jampa Ngodrup Rinpoche, Kensur Rinpoche Lobsang Chojin, Ven. Zawa Tulku Rinpoche and recently Kyabje Trijang Choktrul Rinpoche, just to name a few.\n\nIt seems that compassion is just an intellectual word that is analysed and spoken of but not practiced. So is the word Tonglen (Tibetan), loosely translated as “giving and taking.” The practice of Tonglen involves all of the Six Perfections; giving, ethics, patience, joyous effort, concentration and wisdom. These are the practices of a Bodhisattva. H.H. The Dalai Lama, who is said to practise Tonglen every day, has said of the technique:\n\nWhether this meditation really helps others or not, it gives me peace of mind. Then I can be more effective, and the benefit is immense.\n\nBut where is the giving, when it comes to Dorje Shugden practitioners? For the Tibetans, there is no democracy, no religious freedom and no rights for Dorje Shugden practitioners. Only dictatorship and a military-like government. One is damned if one does not listen and do as the CTA say. All the problems arising from the Dorje Shugden ban stemmed from the dictates of one man (the Dalai Lama), blindly followed and executed by his government (the CTA) and the citizens of his country. No wonder the Tibetan ex-government lost their country and now they have no choice but to exist and operate in Dharamshala through the kindness of the Indian government and its people."
