        "text": "The London, England premiere screening of \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" at the historic Central Hall, Westminster - London. Because of audience demand, the festival scheduled a second screening of the film.\n\nHow you can host a Special Screening of:\n\n\"Dalai Lama Awakening\" Documentary Film\n\n\"Compassion in Action\" Documentary Film \"Dalai Lama Renaissance Vol 2: A Revolution of Ideas\n\nOur films featuring H.H. the Dalai Lama (including the award-winning 'Dalai Lama Renaissance') have screened in front of sold out film festival audiences throughout the world, has received many positive reviews, has won numerous awards at international film festivals, and and has touched, impacted and inspired many thousands of people.\n\nThey have been very successful in theaters, screening in over 100 cities in the U.S., as well as in cinemas around the world.\n\nWe would like to provide the opportunity for organizations to schedule a Special Screenings of \"Dalai Lama Awakening\" (i.e., 'A Poetic ReVision of the award-winning Dalai Lama Renaissance Film'), \"Compassion in Action,\"or \"DLR Vol. 2: A Revolution of Ideas\" for their community.\n\nOur main intention and goal in producing our award-winning Dalai Lama films was to inspire and positively impact as many audiences as possible, and to serve the Highest and Greatest Good. Making these films available to as many audiences as possible is important so that the film fulfills its purpose of serving the Highest Good of others.\n\nSee the positive impact on audiences around the world\n\nof our recent 'Dalai Lama Renaissance' Film, here:\n\n** We understand that some centers and organizations may not have projection equipment to project the film, or a large hall. We recommend that centers rent a video projector (which are not costly to rent), and screen the film in the room that they have available. For smaller centers and organizations, please email us about the possibility of screening one of our films with the equipment (and space) that your center has available to you. We would like to do our very best to accommodate every center that wants to screen our life-affirming films for its audiences. Our goal is to do everything we can to enable as many people as possible to see our films which many audiences have described as films that have deeply impacted their lives. Please email us concerning your special circumstances, and we will do our best to work with you to enable you to screen the film.\n\nWhat organizations are saying about their screenings of our films:\n\nHi Khashyar,\n\nWe had a wonderful event; everyone loved the film and the dialogue after was very rich. Thanks for creating such a beautiful and thought-provoking film.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nReba V.\n\nCommunity Film Series\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nThose who attended were impressed and 5 said they'd like to buy dvds when they come out...\n\nThere was an excitement in the air as people left, though, as if something that had seemed out of reach was not so far after all.\n\nBlessings always,\n\nRuth M.\n\nUnity Church\n\nOregon\n\nThe film was a big success, all loved it!\n\nKathe O.\n\nNew Thought Spritual Center\n\nSouthern Florida Thank for for making this film. Hi Khashyar,\n\nWe hosted our screening of the \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" this past Monday and had a wonderful turnout. What a beautiful film! We all really enjoyed it.\n\nWe would love to show it again, but I just wanted to check in and see what, if any the deadline is. Thanks again. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nPeace,\n\nCeleste S.\n\nYoga Center\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nExciting conversation and discussion of the film went late and was thought provoking and inspiring. Thank you for making a film that is both a gift and service.\n\nYour generosity has been awesome and everyone at the monastery is grateful. Good luck with it, and we wish you every success in the months ahead.\n\nDeep Bow,\n\nAngelina\n\nBuddhist Center\n\nMount Tremper, NY\n\nDear Khashyar, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and all involved in this film,\n\nThe three showings of the \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" in Loveland, Colorado was a true success. I believe that the seed that has been planted is growing amazingly. We do not know the numbers yet as of this morning who attended, but feel that the showings were very successful. Many attendees thanked us for hosting the showings and asked how they may host a showing. We sent them to your website for more information.\n\nWe humbly request that you create a banner link as we also had many people interested in purchasing the DVD when it comes out.\n\nThis was a powerful experience that left me personally inspired to keep up the good work we are doing at Monk Yoga giving by people a tool to find inner-peace and happiness. As the \"synthesis\" groups found that compassion is a more difficult art than it seems, so too have I had difficulty in trying to be a yogi, while running a business in the \"real\" world. I have struggled with whether or not I am capable to persevere, especially with our economy in trouble. I am committed, now more than ever, to being the change. I was reassured that following my favorite quote by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, \"Happiness is a Birthright,\" that I am doing good work. I have much hope that the people who attended this film will feel the way I feel and be the change also. My spirituality has been defined by knowing my own inner-peace includes service to humanity.\n\nMy deep gratitude to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, to you and your film team and all who participated in the making of this film. Thank you for such a wonderful tool in showing my community and the world that we can solve the worlds problems with compassion.\n\nAs you may know we are donating 1/3 of our profit from the film to helping homeless families with children in Loveland. We also set out a donation box which was filled during our three showings. Thank you very much for this gift.\n\nPlease let us know if we can be of service to you again.\n\nMay you have peace, happiness and loving kindness.\n\nNamaste,\n\nJennifer M.\n\nYoga Center\n\nColorado\n\nClick here to read what AUDIENCES have said after seeing \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\"\n\nOne thousand people attended the \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" opening night screening at the Frozen River Film Festival in Minnesota, where \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" had two sold out screenings, and won the festival's \"People's Choice Award.\"\n\nInstructions for Hosting a Screening:\n\nHere is how you can host a Sneak Preview Screening of one of Wakan Film's Documentary Films in your theater or for your organization:\n\n1) Decide which film(s) that you would like to screen. (In some cases, you may be able to screen multiple films for the same screening deposit).\n\nMany Audiences have found it powerful to first screen the \"Dalai Lama Awakening\" Documentary Film , and then afterwards, or on a different date, to screen \"Compassion in Action\" and/or \"DLR Vol. 2,\" with group discussions after each screening. We highly recommend this.\n\nChoose the film that you would like to screen:\n\n*Please be aware that \"Dalai Lama Awakening\" is a feature length award-winning documentary film (narrated by Harrison Ford), and \"DLR\" Vol. 2 is an in-depth experience of the profound dialog between the Dalai Lama and these innovative thinkers like Michael Beckwith (from \"The Secret\"), Fred Alan Wolf (\"The Secret\" and \"What the Bleep Do We Know\"), Amit Goswami (\"What the Bleep Do We Know\" and the \"Quantum Activist\"), Jean Houston, Thom Hartmann and others.\n\n2) Decide which film(s) and choose what date(s) that you would like to hold one or more screenings.\n\n3) Read and fill out the screening form, here: http://dalailamafilm.com/submit-film-screening-request\n\n4) So that the screening of Wakan Films documentary films continue to serve the Greatest Good, and is a benefit to audiences, your organization and Wakan Films (in helping us pay back our expenses in producing the film and to help us produce more films in the future), we believe in equally sharing the ticket revenue from screenings of of our films with the hosting organization and Wakan Films. This is a similar model as other \"spiritual cinema screenings\" used with other spiritual films.\n\n5) The Sneak Preview screening fee is a minimum of $150 USD. We ask that you charge $10 USD per ticket sold to the screenings (and $15-$20 per ticket per screening if Director Khashyar Darvich is present for a personal appearance and Q&A), and so $150 covers half of the total ticket sales of 30 people who can watch the film at your Sneak Preview Event. We ask that you pay the $150 minimum to reserve a date for your screening(s). One screening deposit covers multiple screenings of one or more films. You can pay this amount by check, money order, or credit card. *(So that every organization will be able to share Wakan Films' Documentaries with their community, we are committed to work within the budget of all organizations in determining a screening deposit, so please contact us if you would like to screen the film, cannot afford the $150 screening deposit, and would like to request a lower screening deposit).\n\n6) To pay the $150 screening deposit fee (so that your screening date(s) will be reserved for one or more of the films), you may pay by credit or debit card, or contact us by email for directions as to where you can send a check or money order. Once you have filled out and sent the screening form below, you will be taken to the webpage where you can make your $150 screening deposit payment.\n\nFrequently Asked Question: Question: If I purchase a DVD of one of our films, then don't we have the right to screen it for our church, group or audience without asking permission to do so?Answer: We are not a big film studio, we are an independent film company that has made a deep personal commitment to create films that inspire audiences and serve Humanity and the Greatest Good.\n\nBecause we felt that each of our films were important to produce and share with audiences, we spent our own funds (even taking out loans) to produce our films when necessary.\n\nScreenings help us share the film with audiences, as well as to help pay back to expenses we incurred to create the film, and allow us to create other inspiring, life-affirming films in the future.\n\nPurchasing a DVD (otherwise known as \"home video\") gives an individual the right to view the DVD privately in their home. But screening a DVD or film for a group or in public involves receiving a different permission from the filmmaker to do so. Many people do not realize that it is against the law (a violation of copyright law) to screen a film in public or for a group with the filmmaker's permission.\n\nFor more information regarding this, you may read more here:\n\nhttp://www.mpaa.org/protecting-creativity/\n\nWe just want to do what is fair and serves everyone's Highest Good. Copyright law helps protect the rights of artists whose work is to create art that (in our case) has the intention of inspiring audiences and serving Humanity and the Greatest Good.\n\nPlease feel free to email us if you have any questions regarding this or any other question.\n\n7) One week before your screening, IF the Director or other Wakan Films' Team Member is not appearing in person, we will send you two DVDs of your scheduled film(s). You can download promotional materials from the www.DalaiLamaFilm.com website. We will email you the link to the materials once a screening has been reserved.\n\n8) Please feel free to contact your local newspapers and press to help promote your screening. To help you promote your screening, the filmmakers will be available for interviews with the press in your city or community. We ask that you make the first contact with the press in your community, and then have them contact us for an interview.\n\n9) Your $150 deposit covers half of Wakan Film's share of the first 30 tickets that you sell for your event. For each $10* ticket that you sell above 30 tickets, the ticket price sold is split evenly between Wakan Films and your organization. For example, if you sell 200 tickets to your screening (for a total ticket sales of $2,000), your organization would keep half of that amount ($1,000), and then you would send the other half (minus your $150 deposit) to Wakan Films, which would equal $850. *($15-$20 per ticket per screening if Director Khashyar Darvich is present for a personal appearance and Q&A)\n\n10) 7 days after your screening, please send back the two DVDs, as well as make the payment to Wakan Films from your ticket sales.\n\n11) Also, we would like to help your organization fundraise by offering DVDs of our films to your audiences after your screening. Audiences have shown great interest in purchasing our films after screenings, to watch again and to share their experience with friends. You may purchase wholesale copies of the DVD (Please see: http://dalailamafilm.com/wholesale-dvd-purchase ).\n\n12) Producer-Director Khashyar Darvich has conducted many Q&As with audiences after screenings of his films around the world. His appearance at screenings brings more press coverage for your screening, as well as offers a special experience for your audience whereby audience members may ask Khashyar his experience with the Dalai Lama, and the process of making the film. Please email us if you are interested.\n\n12) If you have any questions, please email us at:\n\nProducer-Director Khashyar Darvich answers questions from the audience after an 800-seat sold out show of \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" at the Boulder International Film Festival in Boulder, Colorado. \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" was the only film in the history of the festival that received a second screening.\n\nPlease fill out this Screening Hosting Form and Agreement. Once we have received the form, we will contact you about scheduling your screening:\n\nThe second sold out screening of \"Dalai Lama Renaissance\" at the Frozen River Film Festival in Minnesota."
