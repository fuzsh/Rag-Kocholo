        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. What is the name of the Dalai Lama who was born in 1935 and became Dalai Lama at age 15?\n\nAnswer: Tenzin Gyatso\n\nTenzin Gyatso became Dalai Lama in 1950 and, at the time this quiz was written, had held the position for well over fifty years. His whole name is Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso. However, he was born Lhamo Döndrub. Every Dalai Lama since the second has had the surname of Gyatso.\n\n2. What Bodhisattva is the Dalai Lama an incarnation of?\n\nAnswer: Avalokitesvara\n\nAlso known as Chenrezig, this is the bodhisattva of compassion. Some consider him to be the reincarnation of Buddha as well, but Avalokiteśvara is known as the Tibetan Bodhisattva, who incarnates into the Dalai Lama and other high Lamas as well. Lama is the Tibetan word for teacher or guru.\n\n3. What is the number of the incarnation of the Dalai Lama who was born in 1935?\n\nAnswer: 14\n\nTenzin Gyatso is the 14th Dalai Lama. He has said on several occasions that he may be the last. This is controversial because, although some feel the Dalai Lama has the power to decide how his reincarnation works out, others feel that as long as the people need him, he must keep coming back. Tenzin Gyatso has said he will not be reincarnated in any lands controlled by China and that he may come back as a woman.\n\n4. In what year was Tenzin Gyatso enthroned into the position?\n\nAnswer: 1950\n\nAt the age of 15, Tenzin Gyatso became the spiritual and supreme leader of Tibet. He was two years old when he was proclaimed the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. In order to find the 'soul child,' as it is called, the Tibetan monks use clues from the previous Lama, as well as putting the child through tests once he is found.\n\nItems belonging to the previous incarnation are presented and if the child picks all the correct items, they pass the test.\n\n5. Who forced the 14th Dalai Lama to sign the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet?\n\nAnswer: The Chinese\n\nMany consider this agreement to be ironically named, as it secured Chinese control over Tibet. China had moved into Tibet in 1950 and Tibetan defenses were no match for the Chinese. Under military pressure, the Dalai Lama and others were forced to sign the treaty, giving control of the country over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nThis treaty has been the major point of contention in the battle of control over Tibet.\n\n6. What significant event happened in 1959?\n\nAnswer: A failed uprising caused the Dalai Lama to flee Tibet\n\nAlthough the Dalai Lama had tried to use diplomacy to free Tibet, his government was receiving financial aid and weapons from America. In 1959, the Dalai Lama's followers feared that China would try to assassinate him. The military uprising was quickly defeated, however. Along with 80,000 followers, the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet.\n\n7. When they left Tibet, where did the Dalai Lama and his followers flee to?\n\nAnswer: India\n\nHe crossed the border into India on March 30 of 1959. The journey took him and his people through Assam and eventually they ended up in Dharamsala. Some time later he set up the Government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamsala, India. He has been the head of this government ever since.\n\n8. In what year did the 14th Dalai Lama win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nAnswer: 1989\n\nThey said he won because of his views on handling issues non-violently and that it was in memory of Gandhi. During his acceptance speech, the Dalai Lama criticized China for their actions in Tiananmen Square during the student protests held that year. He promised that those who died (some being rolled over by tanks) would not have died in vain.\n\n9. Is the Dalai Lama a lifelong vegetarian?\n\nAnswer: He tried it but not for long\n\nThe Dalai Lama was a vegetarian for a short time, but he developed jaundice. He had to go back to eating meat. Because of the lack of farming land in Tibet, meat has been a staple of their diet for many centuries. For some cultures, this may make it hard for them to become strict vegetarians. The Dalai Lama does value animal life but can't be a vegetarian for health reasons.\n\n10. In March of 2009, what country refused the Dalai Lama a visa?\n\nAnswer: South Africa\n\nThe Dalai Lama wanted to go to South Africa to attend an international peace conference. The Dalai Lama has had a strong relationship with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and they would have attended the conference together. After the Dalai Lama was denied the visa, Tutu withdrew from the conference in protest. South African officials later admitted they wanted to maintain positive relations with China and that letting the Dalai Lama into the country might have hurt those relations.\n\nSource: Author foxbarking\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor CellarDoor before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
