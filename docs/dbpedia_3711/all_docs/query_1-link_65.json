        "text": "Syracuse -- Producers and promoters of the One World Concert scheduled for Tuesday at the Carrier Dome have said they believe the event is the biggest musical collaboration to ever roll through Central New York.\n\nWith 26 artists on the musical lineup, they might be right.\n\nBut producers have said little about the event’s schedule — who is performing with whom and for how long?\n\nA list of frequently asked questions on the One World Concert's website says the event will be 7 to 11 p.m. and the Dalai Lama will speak for about 50 minutes.\n\nThat leaves three hours and 10 minutes for the music — or a little more than 7 minutes per artist. That’s not counting any time for the evening’s emcee, Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nHere is a link to the scheduled performers.\n\nThe website goes on to say that each artist will perform at least one song. Some artists will perform together, according to the website.\n\nSeveral artists plan to perform a joint song for the Dalai Lama, according to Mark Emery, spokesman for World Harmony Productions, the company producing One World Concert.\n\nEmery could not say more about that collaboration, if musicians were bringing their own bands or give additional details about the event’s schedule.\n\nSU students were able to purchase discounted $25 tickets and general admission tickets have sold for $35, $45 or $55. Tickets for seats in the first 15 rows cost $200.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the event was not sold out."
