        "text": "HAMILTON – In preparation for April’s visit from the Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, Colgate University will be hosting a Tibetan and Buddhist film series every Thursday through April 17. For the last half-century, the Dalai Lama has been an international leader in advocating for freedom of the people of Tibet, opposing violence and calling for respecting human rights worldwide. The Nobel Peace Prize winner has visited 62 countries on six continents and met with elected officials, crowned royalty and religious leaders. The next film, “Travellers and Magicians,” is the story of two men hitchhiking through the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan in search of a better life. One man, Dondup, shares the road with a Buddhist monk, an apple seller, a papermaker and his daughter and, along the way, learns about what is important in life. The showing will be Thursday, Feb. 28 at 7 p.m. in the Golden Auditorium in the Little Hall. Other films in the series will be: * March 6 – “Dreaming Lhasa,” the story of an American filmmaker who is visiting Dharamsala, India, the Dalai Lama’s exile headquarters, to make a documentary about former political prisoners from Tibet, one of whom she becomes involved with. * March 13 – “Little Buddha.” Three children, including one from Seattle, travel to Nepal where the Buddhist monks are in search of the reincarnation of their teacher. * March 27 – “Saltmen of Tibet,” a film detailing the lives of nomads of Western Tibet. * April 3 – “The Cup,” a comedy set in 1996 about a group of boy monks in a Tibetan monastery in exile in India who are determined to watch the World Cup soccer tournament. * April 10 – “Dreams of Tibet,” in which journalist Orville Schell explores the clash of values between the American opinion of China’s human rights record and the uncomprehending and intransigent Chinese leadership. * April 17 – “10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.” Ten questions are asked of the Dalai Lama by filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray, who examines some fundamental questions of the modern age by weaving together observations from his own journeys and the wisdom of the Buddhist spiritual leader. All films will be shown at 7 p.m. in the Golden Auditorium, save “Dreaming Lhasa,” which venue is unknown. The Dalai Lama will be at Colgate University Tuesday, April 22."
