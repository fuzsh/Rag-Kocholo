        "text": "Some things will never change. Some things will always be the same. Lean down your ear upon the earth and listen…..All things belonging to the earth will never change–the leaf, the blade, the flower, the wind that cries and sleeps and wakes again, the trees whose stiff arms clash and tremble in the dark, and the dust of lovers long since buried in the earth–all things proceeding from the earth to seasons, all things that lapse and change and come again upon the earth–these things will always be the same, for they come up from the earth that never changes, they go back into the earth that lasts forever. Only the earth endures, but it endures forever – Thomas Wolfe, in You Can’t Go Home Again (1940).\n\nThere are numerous influences in my childhood that propelled me to a career in the Earth sciences; a father that loved to prospect and collect minerals, hundreds of family camping trips to the most interesting geologic province in the world (the Rocky Mountains!), and a progressive high school that offered a rich course in geology. In hindsight, one of the most important influences was the fact that I grew up on the flank of a huge volcanic complex, the Jemez Mountain Volcanic Field. The terrain of deep canyons, flat mesas, and a beautiful grass valley, the Valle Grande, surrounded by ponderosa pine covered peaks frame my childhood memories and help define home for me. The Jemez Mountains rise some 5000′ above the Rio Grande River and are remnants of a massive volcanic system that experienced two “super” eruptions about 1.4 million years ago. The Jemez don’t really look like a volcano today if one’s idea of an active volcano is Mt. St. Helens or Kilauea – it is a large circular depression surrounded by the high peaks that once where the steep slopes of a series of craters that spewed forth hundreds of cubic km of hot ash. The figure at the top of this column is an aerial view of the Jemez, and the depression and surrounding peaks protect a series of valleys that once were filled with rain water after the great eruptions. These valleys, or valles in spanish, are a unique feature of the Jemez. These mountains shaped me in many ways. Out my back door was a riveting geologic panorama that provided an open invitation to explore nature. Although most of the Valle Grande proper was off limits during my youth – it was a working cattle ranch that we just called “The Baca” in recognition that it was part of a old Land Grant called Baca Location Number 1 – the surrounding mountains and forest lands were our play ground.\n\nI learned about hiking, camping, wildlife, and calm call of nature. I even learned some things about mineral collecting; in general, there is not much “mineral wise” in the Jemez, with the one exception. My first vehicle was a hand-me-down four wheel drive Toyota Land Cruiser. Not many things worked on it (including the gas gauge which more than once left me stranded), but it did afforded me the freedom to explore the Jemez on my own. My favorite trip was to the ghost town of Bland, a short-lived gold mining center located a few miles south of the Valles Caldera. The mineral deposits were not formed by the volcanic processes that built the Jemez Mountains, but were from an earlier epoch of magmatic activity that injected quartz dikes into surrounding bedrock. The Jemez volcanics covered these dikes, and later, through the randomness of erosion, were exposed in a narrow canyon (Bland Canyon). In 1893 the first of a dozen claims was staked on these dikes for gold and silver. A rush ensued, and soon a town was built and the population grew to more than a 1000 people. The town was named Bland in honor of Richard Bland who had advocated for the governmental purchase of silver, and in turn, that bullion was minted into silver dollars. The Bland act, and further requirements for the government to purchase silver (in particular, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act) were repealed in 1893 causing a collapse in silver prices — just as the mines in Bland were being discovered.\n\nI drove to the ghost town of Bland every chance I got in the early 1970s. There was a “back way” in that required delicate 4WD navigation; I was rewarded with a harrowing journey through the Jemez Mountains, and a chance to search through all the old building looking for artifacts and the mining dumps for some sign of gold or silver. Mostly my searches were unsuccessful, but I had taste of the treasure hunter.\n\nIn the year 2000 the Federal Government purchased the “Baca” and it became the Valles Caldera Natural Preserve. The charge of the Preserve was to remediate the effects of logging and cattle/sheep grazing, and eventually make the Valles Caldera a multi-use facility. Although access is still carefully controlled to the Valles it has become the home to several special events. In 2006 it became the site of a trail run – first a marathon, and later a half marathon and 10 km run were added. The course has changed over the years, and a fire in late May of 2013 forced a change to a partial out-and-back route. The chance to run in a certified super volcano, only a few miles from my house is a huge draw – the Valles Grande Caldera Runs are a geologist’s dream.\n\nThe volcano in my backyard\n\nThe Jemez Mountains and Valles Caldera are a spectacular sight from space. The satellite image above shows the circular depression that is about 13 miles across that formed after a series of very large eruptions of ash-flow tuffs emptied a large, shallow magma chamber. Nearly 800 cubic km of ash were propelled from various volcanic vents, and the “hole” left by this erupting ash caused the volcanic edifice to collapsed back into itself producing a broad valley. Later, renewed magmatic activity pushed rhyolitic magmas up through the fractures formed during the collapse, producing a ring of domes breaking up the original valley into smaller, isolated valleys. The largest of these magma extrusions, known as resurgent domes, is Redondo Peak, which has an elevation of 11,258′ and towers some 2500′ above the valley floor. Redondo Peak is not a volcano – it was not “erupted” but extruded from the magma chamber beneath the Valles much like tooth paste would be extruded from a tube as it is slowly squeezed.\n\nThe Valles Caldera remarkable symmetric, and incredibly well preserved — there were no major eruptions after the last collapse a million years ago to obscure the valley, resurgent domes and ring fractures that were formed during that collapse. These qualities attracted geologists from around the world, and it has become the archetype volcanic caldera referenced in hundreds of studies and textbooks. Although the Jemez Mountains were recognize being volcanic by the later part of the 19th century, it was not until the 1920s when C.S. Ross of the USGS visited, and later teamed with R.L. Smith in 1946 that the area was mapped in detail. This mapping was done in part to understand the potential for supplying the new Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory with fresh water, and whether it was possible to bring a large natural gas line across the Valles to provide energy for my home town. In 1970 Smith, Bailey and Ross published a beautiful geologic map of the Jemez Mountains and the Valles Caldera (figure below), and was the first map to grace the wall of my bedroom (I wish I could find that original wall hanging, but alas, it was packed away when I left for college and no doubt is today been composted and returned to the soil…).\n\nThe colors of the map hint at the extraordinary history of the Jemez Mountain Volcanic Field (JMVF). The exact reason that the JMVF exists remains a bit of a mystery; it is located at the intersection of the western margin of the Rio Grande Rift and a trend of volcanic fields called the Jemez Lineament that has been postulated as a ancient “zone of weakness” that allows magma generated in the mantle to rise up into the crust. I think that it is far more likely that the Jemez Lineament is the lucky connection of dots on a map, and that a more plausible explanation is that marks the boundary between a thick and stable crust (the Colorado Plateau) and thinner, more tectonically active crust. Irregardless, it is clear that the opening of the Rio Grande rift caused volcanic activity to began about 13 million years ago in the vicinity of present day Los Alamos. For about 10 million years the volcanism was dominated by basaltic lava flows. Black Mesa, near Espanola, is one of the most famous landmarks representing this period of volcanism (Black Mesa is about 3.7 million years old). About 3 million years ago eruption of more silica rich magmas commenced and the Jemez Mountain began to grow — there were probably 6 to 10 major volcanoes that tapped interconnected magma bodies. These volcanoes conspired to create a major eruption about 1.5 million years ago that erupted what is known as the Otowi Member of the Bandelier Tuff. Nearly 450 cubic kilometers of ash was erupted over a short period (probably a few years, but certainly less than a few decades). This resulted in a collapse of the volcanic system, and the creation of the Valle Toledo Caldera. This caldera is obscured by a similar sized eruption about 1.2 million years ago that ejected about 350 cubic kilometers of ash, the Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff. On the eastern margin of the Valle Toledo is the highest peak in the Jemez, Tschicoma Peak (elevation 11,561′), an remnant that survived both collapses. The second eruption, and subsequent collapse created the now familiar Valles Caldera.\n\nThe widely popular phrase “super volcano” has its roots in the 20th century, but mostly it is a phrase invented by the media around 2002 to dramatize the power of big volcanoes. By 2003 the phrase appeared in more than 100 stories that covered everything from global warming and cooling to mass extinctions. The USGS tied the phrase to the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), a measure of “explosiveness of eruptions”, and a VEI value of 8 became the definition of a super volcano, and implies a volume of material erupted that is at least 250 cubic km. There have been 3 super volcanic eruptions in the US in the last 1.2 million years; the Jemez, Long Valley, California and Yellowstone in Montana/Wyoming. All three of these eruptions resulted in the creation of a caldera. Of course, our human centric view of geologic time — i.e, a million years is a long time — distorts the sense of “super” volcanic eruptions. Although Yellowstone was a large eruption, it was dwarfed by an eruption 28 million years ago that created the La Garita Caldera near Creede, Colorado. Over the same time that it took the Jemez to erupt the Tshirege tuff, the La Garita erupted the Fish Canyon Tuff — all 5,000 cubic km of it (more than 15 times larger!). Despite the size of La Garita, Los Alamos is perched on the shoulder of a real super volcano.\n\nThe relative tranquility of the Valles Caldera belies its violent history and magnificent history. The most recent significant volcanic activity in the Jemez is the Banco Bonito rhyolite flow, which is located smack dab in the middle of the Jemez Caldera marathon. The Banco Bonito is a very silica-rich rhyolite, and filled with large blocks of obsidian. Although most everyone recognizes obsidian, and thinks arrowheads and black shiny pebbles, the geologist thinks about very rapid cooling of a volcanic rock. Obsidian is silica glass – same material as a chunk of quartz, but it has no crystalline structure due to the rapid quenching of the hot lava. The Banco Bonito rhyolite was extruded (probably not erupted) 40,000 years ago. Although the Jemez Mountain Volcanic Field will be active again in the future, it is mainly showing signs of exhaustion, and the likelihood of a future, large scale eruption is extremely small. Running through the Valles Caldera on a marathon is a unique experience. Laid out along the course is every aspect of a few million years of violent tectonic history. Ash fall, resurgent domes, ancient lake beds that filled with water in cooler and wetter times.\n\nThe Valles Caldera Marathon\n\nThe Valles Caldera runs – there is a marathon, half marathon, and a 10 km – are not classic trail runs per se. Most of the courses utilize dirt roads that once were used to move cattle or cut timber, and only some short segments are single track. However, this does not diminish the spectacular setting of the race. It does mean that most people run the distances much faster than a typical trail run (I say “most” because single track versus tire rutted roads has nearly zero impact on my speed – sadly). The races start at Banco Bonito Staging Area within Valles Caldera National Preserve. The name “Banco Bonito” is applied to a modest plateau that is composed of the rhyolite-obsidian conglomerate that goes by the same name. It is easy to find very attractive pieces of obsidian at the starting line — just look down. There are more than 300 people signed up for the half marathon and 10k, but only about 45 of us toe the line for the full marathon at 7:30 in the morning.\n\nThe course for the marathon heads due east, climbing up the Banco Bonito lava flow along a logging road. The lava flow is probably not obvious to most of the runners as it now is forested, and only along certain sections are there stratigraphic sections exposed. But the topography of the lava flow is evident; over the first three miles we climb about 450 feet (not much elevation gain, but enough to slow old runners down). The pack of runners sorts out pretty rapidly, and good runners like Dave Coblentz disappear with a doppler shift over the horizon. At the three mile mark the course comes to an aid station on the edge of a large bowl shaped depression — El Cajete. This is a very significant geologic formation (but not such a significant aid station). El Cajete is the crater that last had significant volcanic activity in the Valles Caldera. It is responsible for the Banco Bonito lava flow 40,000 years ago, as well as a massive eruption of pumice sometime after the lava flow. The pumice fell close to the El Cajete, and dammed the Jemez river creating a lake in the Valle Grande.\n\nFrom El Cajete the course drops off the plateau and the run is downhill for 2 miles. Fast and easy. Unfortunately, the elevation lost is a penalty for the next part of the race. At mile five there is a steep climb up a pass between Redondo Peak and another resurgent dome called South Mountain. In a little bit more than a mile we climb 550 feet to the high point of the race, 9150′. The top of the pass is a reward, but also a harbinger of things to come since we have to repeat this climb on the return from the Valle Grande.\n\nFrom mile 6 to mile 12 the course is in the Valle Grande – well, strictly speaking, skirting around the edge of the Valle. The grass “meadow” of the Valle Grande is due to the fact that it was a reoccurring lake bed in the last million years, and it is not particularly friendly nutrition wise to trees. The last time the lake had a significant extent was after the El Cajete pumice eruption, and probably lasted for 4 to 7 thousand years (there have been smaller lakes during damp cool periods usually associated with glacial epochs). The picture below is a view across the Valle towards Pajarito Mountain. That summit, all 10,400 feet of it, is the high point of the Jemez Mountain Trail Runs — which will be run a month from now.\n\nRunning through the Valle is always wonderful. It is sensational scenery, and mostly flat topography. At mile 9.4 I get passed by the leader of the pack returning towards the finish. This means that the leader is about 4 miles ahead of me already. Once the first runner passes by me it is a steady stream; strangely, all the runners that are ahead of me look like they are strong and running very easily. I, on the other hand, am beginning to lose focus and daydreaming of the geology. Dave Coblentz passes me with a group of 5 or 6 runners at mile 9.7. The course “turns around” is at a point just beyond another resurgent dome — Cerro Pinon. The milage here is just about 12 miles; there is a mental boost knowing that the “out and back” is done, but I also realize that there are 14 miles to go. For the next 5 miles I pass by a few runners (a very few) that are slower than me, but mostly see no one. I am alone – happy, but alone. The climb back up the pass at South Mountain is brutal, but once that is done I am certain that I will finish the race largely unscathed. The run down from South Mountain is fast, but as I expected, hard on my legs. The run between miles 18 and 22 is a descent of nearly 800 feet. It should be fast, but my legs are tired. There is a great aid station at mile 19, and I stop for way too long to eat oreo cookies. The descent ends at a broad meadow called Redondo Meadow. This meadow is an wildlife experiential station, and there are lots of people working in the area. The course route is always confusing here because there is no real trail across the meadow, and there are meandering streams. The course is marked, but that means you actually have to pay attention to the flagging (not my best skill – however, I have memorized the maps, so I don’t get detoured). Once across the meadow the home stretch begins. A steep climb up the Banco Bonito lava flow, and then a lonely run back to the finish. I pass a couple of slowest runners of the 1/2 marathon, and try to encourage them (however, they are really tired).\n\nI rambled into the finish line in a little over 5 1/2 hours. It is a nice marathon – not exactly a trail run, but much harder than a street run. The total elevation gain is about 3000 feet and the average elevation along the course is 8400′. However, it is the geology that makes this run so great. The Valles Caldera is truly a marvel….\n\nThe universe is built on a plan the profound symmetry of which is somehow present in the inner structure of our intellect, Paul Valery, 19th century French Poet\n\nWhen I first started building a mineral collection — back about 1960 — the single most compelling criteria for determining if a specimen was a “keeper” or just something for the beer flats filled with colorful, yet, unworthy rocks, was whether there was a euhedral crystal. My fascination with the perfection of a sharp crystal face is not at all uncommon for beginning collectors. The fact that nature could take time to construct something so perfect strikes a deep chord; the vast universe created by the ultimate act of violence – the big bang – and ruled by entropy, and inevitable decay, still values symmetry. I recall an early discussion with my mother on the beauty of spring flowers – I asked her why she thought they were beautiful, and she responded with a joyful exposition on the bright and varied colors and the delicate nature of the pistil, and remarkable symmetry of the petals. I told her that the petals were exactly like crystals since they are always alike, and must be following some sort of “rules”.\n\nThe English word symmetry comes from the Greek symmetria; in turn, symmetria is a concatenation of Greek words sun and metron, meaning “together” and “measure”. There is a substantial body of Greek literature that refers to symmetry as “harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance”. This philosophical definition of symmetry deviates from the strictly mathematical definition, but still projects the power of something that is predictable and has a geometric balance to be pleasing to the eye. This “pleasing to the eye” is a euphemism for beauty — hard to define exactly, but beauty excites our aesthetic senses.\n\nTo me, there is nothing more pleasing to the eye than a silver specimen exhibiting spinel twinning – repeating patterns of crystals that produces a highly geometric weave. The photograph at the top of the column is a silver from the Kearsarge Mine, Houghton Co., in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The specimen is defined by a central rib — an elongated stack of silver octahedrons, and branches intersecting the this rib at angles of approximately 60 degrees. In turn, these branches have secondary branches exiting at similar angles. The repeating geometry yields a specimen architecture that is clean and sharp – an exemplar of what the Greeks meant by symmetry.\n\nSilver: a special element\n\nSilver is a remarkable element that can form an array of minerals; about 180 different species. Thankfully, elemental silver is sufficiently inert to occur in nature and is widely distributed throughout the world. Native silver is a metal of bright white color; it has the highest reflectivity of any metal. Silver is also the best metallic conductor of heat and electricity and extremely malleable and ductile. These properties are, of course, a result of crystal and atomic structure, which is a face-centered cube with metallic bonds. The atomic radius of silver is nearly identical to that of gold – and gold commonly substitutes into the silver crystal lattice.\n\nSilver crystallizes in the isometric system, and although individual, sharp macro crystals are rare, the octahedron and cube forms are most common. The largest individual crystals are from Kongsberg, Norway, where some octahedrons 3-5 cm on a side grace a few fortunate collections.\n\nAs a rule, crystals of silver are equi-dimensional or platy. The platy nature comes from the propensity from silver to twin (this is similarly seen in gold and copper) on octahedral faces {111}. This twinning is known as spinel twinning and is described below. The conditions for when spinel twinning occurs appears limited – although silver masses of spinel twins are known from hundreds of locations, there are only three or four localities where this type of silver crystallization is common. The two most famous localities are Batopilas, Mexico and Chanarcillo, Chile.\n\nBy far, the most common form of silver in a mineral collections is the wire – which is a secondary growth from the decomposition of silver sulfides and sulfosalts. Any silver deposit that undergoes supergene enrichment inevitably has silver wire specimens. The picture at the top of this section of the article is a fine silver wire mass from Tongchong in China. The wires in this specimen are attached to a very small piece of acanthite, no doubt the host material that provided the silver. All silver sulfides and most silver sulfosalts will produce silver wire upon disassociation — especially promoted by heating. Although wires can be extremely interesting and coveted specimens for collectors, there are been numerous cases where the wires were “grown” by unscrupulous collector/dealers and passed off as “natural” specimens.\n\nBeauty in Nature\n\nWhen I hear the word “beautiful” used to describe minerals by collectors I often ask what they mean. More often than not, the answers seem wanting to me. Mostly, it is about color — pink and red minerals are always “beautiful”, but black and brown minerals are “interesting”. Although color can transfix, and certainly evoke emotion, I can not relate to it as the primary metric of natural beauty. I am also looking for structure in my surroundings – a window into the soul of nature, order out of the chaos all around me.\n\nA seminal event for me was attending “math summer camp” during the summer between 7th and 8th grade. The instructor was an outstanding teacher named Jack Gehre, and his focus was geometry and trigonometry. Early in the class Mr. Gehre introduced Euler’s formula; for any normal polyhedron, the sum of the number of faces plus the number of vertices, minus the number of edges always equals 2. I spent the rest of the summer camp trying to understand why. I suddenly had a “rule” in nature that I could apply to my mineral collection — a rule mysterious and powerful, but incredibly simple. It was beautiful. I did not know much about Euler then, but later in college I was introduced to another “law” by Leonhard Euler — an incredible 18th century Swiss mathematician — that has to be the most beautiful equation in all of nature. I was in a class on series analysis, and the professor, Alan Sharples, walked in the first day of the semester and wrote the following on the black board:\n\nSharples said, “this is Euler’s identity, a remarkable assertion. Prove it. That is all for this first day of class.” Turns out that this is pretty easy to prove, but when I viewed this on the blackboard I was transfixed — it was pure beauty. Imagine three essential mathematical constants – e, pi, and i – combined to equal -1. Wow – simple, brief, and exact. To this day I view this as a definition of beauty (Euler’s identity is routinely identified as the one of the most beautiful equations in science).\n\nEuler’s identify may seem a long ways from realm of beauty in the mineral kingdom. However, to me, they are very much related. Simple, surprising, and an expression of natural symmetry.\n\nRespect the Spinel Twin\n\nCrystal growth in nature is quite complex; the crystal form, crystal size, crystal chemistry all are expressions of the paragenesis. Crystallization for most geologic materials involves the precipitation of a solid (the crystal) out of a solution or solvent (usually hot thermal fluids, although solutions of nearly any temperature can carry dissolved loads of ions and cations). Crystals start with nucleation of a few molecules from the solution, and then growth occurs by pulling the necessary ionic components out of solution. The rate at which individual crystals grows depends strongly on the saturation level of the ions of interest – supersaturated solutions appear to be able to grow crystals at extraordinary rates (at least compared to geologic time!), sometimes at several cubic cm per hour.\n\nIt is not clear who first recognized twinning in crystals, but it was first written about in detail by Rene-Just Haüy in his epic tome Traité de Minéralogie, published in 1801. In the beginning part of the 20th century there were a number of studies to understanding twinning in minerals. The classic definition was introduced by Friedel in 1926: A twin is a complex crystalline edifice built up of two or more homogeneous portions of the same crystal species in contact (juxtaposition) and orientated with respect to each other according to well-defined laws. The “well-defined laws” all are based on some simple ideas, the most important of which is that within a crystal core that a least one lattice row (i.e., a crystal edge) is common to two different crystals. The figures below illustrate this concept — the lattice of a cubic crystal is defined by four points, and a plane can be drawn through these points that allows a second crystal to share lattice points but have a rotated orientation. Twinning adds symmetry to a crystal aggregate, most commonly about a rotation axis or reflection across a plane. In the metals copper, gold and silver, a particular type of twin is common, called the spinel twin.\n\nSpinel twins are so-named because it is a very common habit seen in the mineral spinel. They are contact twins, meaning that have a planar composition surface shared by two individual crystals; this surface is along an octahedral face (written as {111}), and means that there is a rotation of 180o about the contact plane. This is illustrated by the lower figure above – there are two octahedrons joined along a contact plane, but the top terminations “point” in directions and are separated by 120o. The figure below shows how spinel twins can be flattened, and give the characteristic triangular faces that are seen on platy crystals of silver (and gold).\n\nIn silver, spinel twinning almost always repeats itself with regularity, producing a pattern that resembles a weave of wires. The silver at the top of this section of the article is from Batopilas, Chihuahua, Mexico, and is an example of a mass of spinel twins. Through the middle of the specimen is a series of parallel elongated crystals, and growing “off” these strands are regular strands oriented at 60 degrees (or 120 degrees, strictly speaking). These are all spinel twins – repeating some natural frequency that is due to a long lost geologic condition. Once assembled, the spinel twins from an aggregate of crystals that has been called a “herringbone” silver in reference to the similarity to the shape of the rib cage of the smelly game fish beloved by the peoples of the Baltic.\n\nWhy do spinel twins form in silver? Under certain ideal conditions, a single large crystal represents a “minimum” energy condition, and thus is due to an important thermodynamic rule — a chemical system will stabilize at state of least energy. If individual crystals are a minimum energy state, then twinned crystals are by necessity at state of higher energy, and thus should be rare. However, environmental conditions tend to localize energy states; for a supersaturated solution, the crystal growth is extremely rapid, and twinned crystal allow more ions to join a crystallize aggregate faster, thus minimizing a local energy state. For all “herringbone” silver specimens it appears that the conditions of formation require a supersaturated solution, low in concentrations of sulfur, and extremely rapid crystal growth. These conditions are relatively rare in most epithermal vein deposits; it is very uncommon to find a spinel twinned silver specimen from the great silver deposits of Colorado, Ontario or Freiberg!\n\nThe silver pictured above is my favorite native silver in my entire mineral collection. This is a large “herringbone” plate with a three dimensional repeating pattern of twins. The specimen represents something remarkable in turns of crystal growth. The tiniest variations in chemistry or temperature during growth would have truncated the growth of this silver weave.\n\nA close examination of the Chanarcillo herringbone yields views of spectacular detail – endlessly repeating, and shouting the fundamental rules for symmetry in crystals. Along the edges of the crystalline mass you can see individual octahedrons – the termination of various elongated crystals.\n\nBeauty and the pretenders\n\nRapid growth in silver often produces crystalline masses that are complex. However, spinel twins are distinct, and uncommon. Rapid growth often leads to dendritic masses – mostly silver feather patterns or strings of stacked cubes. These dendrites are not spinel twins; in fact, instead of fundamental order, they represent chaotic growth. Although there is some sense of beauty in the randomness of dendrites, it is mostly through “self-similarity” – various patterns that appear to scale with size. This is fundamentally different than ordered spinel twins – and in many ways points to disordered processes. I am always shocked (okay, probably an overly harsh expression of emotion) when I find dealers selling “herringbone” silvers that are in fact dendrites. That is like marketing hamburger as Filet Mignon. Similarly, silver wires can certainly be attractive; however, they are products of mineral destruction not construction. To me, beauty in silver spinel twins is about construction, order, and symmetry. Defining beauty will allows be in the eye of the beholder — it is just better when there are rules involved.\n\nMonument Valley is the place where God put the West. John Wayne, American Actor, circa 1950.\n\nThe southern half of the Colorado Plateau stretches from Lake Meade in the west, to Cuba, New Mexico in the east, and is a stunning desert highland of pastel colored bluffs, and exotic wind sculpted rocks. The land is both beautiful and desolate; in more than 80,000 square miles there are only 250,000 inhabitants (more people live around Lake Meade and Flagstaff that the rest of the southern plateau combined), but there are 10 National Parks and 17 National Monuments, 10 Wilderness areas, along with another half dozen parks in the Navajo Nation. It is also the land that American geologists wandered in the 1860-1880s and their observations shaped modern thoughts about geologic time and the extraordinary patient, but always persistent, force of erosion which eventually grinds even the highest mountains to dust. John Wesley Powell navigated the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon and Clarence Dutton mapped the geology with remarkable insight; these geologic giants were the vanguard of the American contribution of “the second age of discovery” that transformed the mystery of nature into a science. I love visiting these desert lands; in a crowded and noisy world the Colorado Plateau imposes it’s will of solitude and reminds one of man’s temporary significance. Ulta Adventures runs a series of ultra runs across the southern Colorado Plateau that they call the Grand Circle. Last year I ran the Ultra Adventures Bryce Canyon 50k – and it was a spectacular run! The geology was great, the UA staff are wonderful, and course was challenging. This year I decided I wanted to run the UA ultra in Monument Valley held in mid-March. No other piece of real-estate has defined the American psyche of “the old west” than Monument Valley. You would be hard pressed to find any baby boomer that would not immediately recognize the “Mittens” — sandstone bluffs in Monument Valley — as the movie backdrop to scores of films.\n\nMonument Valley is a tract of canyon lands located about 100 km west of the Four Corners along the Utah-Arizona border. Within the valley there is a 140 square mile park – the Navajo Nation’s Monument Valley Park — that was “discovered” by film director John Ford in 1939 with the release of the classic western Stagecoach. Ford chose Monument Valley because, to his mind, the desolation and isolation of the bluffs and red sandstone captured the essence of the hardscrabble life of the wild west. Ford cast John Wayne as the Ringo Kid, a gunslinger. This roll is largely credited with making Wayne a film superstar – and forever he is pictured across from the Mittens. There is a creation myth about how John Ford found Monument Valley — it starts with Harry Goulding, a sheep herder and owner of a trading post in Monument Valley packing up and heading to Hollywood with photographs of the scenery as an act of desperation during the crushing poverty of the great depression. Goulding showed up at Ford’s offices and somehow, against all logic, convinced Ford that he should film his upcoming western in the corner of Arizona that was hundreds of miles from the nearest train station and only accessible by a dicey dirt road. Ford eventually filmed parts of 6 of his most famous movies there; other directors followed, and Monument Valley has appeared in more than 100 movies!\n\nIt is only appropriate that the rich movie heritage of Monument Valley would collide with ultra runs. The 1994 movie Forrest Gump is the tale of a man’s life that serendipitously criss-crosses 40 years of tremulous American history. I saw the movie in Flagstaff, Arizona when my wife was working on the geodetics of volcanoes at the USGS field office – we loved the movie and it remains one our top ten favorites ever. In the movie, Forrest starts running on October 1, 1979 to ease the pain of rejection by his true love. He ends up running for 3 years, 2 months, 14 days and 16 hours, and covered 15,248 miles (crossing America at least 4 times) – no ultra runner has ever equaled the trail brazed by Forrest. Forrest ended his run at Monument Valley – he just stopped, and decided the run was over, and it was time to go home.\n\nWhat a perfect setting for an ultra run; geology, history, and the termination point for the greatest ultra run ever.\n\nRunning on Ancient Sand Dunes Monument Valley refers to a large swath of landscape along the Arizona-Utah border, but most people associate the name with a modest 3 by 5 mile drainage basin. This basin stretches from the world famous Mittens in the north to Wetherill and Hunts Mesas in the south. The name “Monument Valley” first showed up on maps in 1917. Who exactly was responsible for that moniker is lost to history, but the name is appropriately descriptive; the view down the valley is filled with monoliths and buttes that are the erosional remnants of a thick layered cake of sedimentary rocks that were deposited by water and wind nearly 200 million years ago. The Navajo name for the valley is Tse’Bii’Ndzisgaii, which translates approximately to Valley of the Rocks (at least my Navajo friend tells me this – others have slight variations).\n\nThe Colorado Plateau is one of the most unique geologic provinces on the globe. A huge, broad plain or basin was formed at the margin of the primal landmass that today we call the North American Continent. This “basin” captured the cobbles and shards that resulted from the erosion of the ancient continent. Sometimes the basin was beneath a shallow sea filled with corral reefs and marine life. Other times it was at the edge of an uplifted and rejuvenated continent and was covered by a system of deltas cut by meandering rivers – not unlike the Mississippi delta today. Still other times it was a massive wasteland covered by sand dunes. Over a period of 500 million years this broad area we now call the Plateau accumulated a lithic layer cake; thousands of feet of alternating sandstones, limestones, shales and conglomerates. About 20 million years ago this layered rock cake was uplifted, and subjected to the same erosional forces – wind, water and ice – that had ground ancient mountain ranges to dust.\n\nThe slice of this great lithic cake that is exposed in Monument Valley dates from the Permian Age. The rocks exposed on the Valley floor are the oldest – and are known as the Organ Rock shale (about 280 million years old). This shale was deposited as muddy clays in deltas and swamps. Above the shale is the rock that builds the monuments, the DeChelly sandstone. The DeChelly is an amazing rock – it is a nearly pure quartz grain sandstone, that is tough and strong, and can maintain vertical cliff faces hundreds of feet high. The DeChelly was formed from wind blown sand dunes. The modern day analogy for these type of sand dunes is the Namib Desert along the southwestern coast of Africa. The desert that made the DeChelly sandstone was long lived — probably 25 million years of blowing dunes. Finally, that desert yielded to a more hospitable environment and rivers returned depositing sandstones and shales, which we call the Moenkopi formation. About 230 million years ago the last of the rocks exposed at Monument Valley were deposited on top of the Moenkopi, the hard cobbles and boulders of the Shinarump conglomerate. The Shinarump is the “cap stone” on the mesa in Monument Valley, and reason that the softer rocks below have not completely eroded away.\n\nThe landscape of Monument Valley today is only a shadow of what it most have been a few million years ago. In a few more million years, there will be no sign of DeChelly sandstone, and all the steep cliffs will have been reduced to rubble. The unique monuments are a result of the layered cake geology; the Shinarump conglomerate is a difficult rock to erode, and for millions of years protected the “softer” rocks below. However, joints and zones of weakness in the Shinarump eventually yielded to the relentless rains, frost, wind and gravity, and began to erode forming small washes exposing the DeChelly sandstone below. The DeChelly is relatively easily eroded, but forms steep cliff faces, making for spectacular canyons. Eventually these canyons cut down to the soft Organ Rock shale which is rapidly washed away. The canyons then begin to undercut the DeChelly, and the stout sandstone collapsed in rock falls and avalanches. What is left are isolated buttes, mesas, and rock towers. When you run through Monument Valley your view is one of the distant past. The vertical cliffs demand your attention; they tell a story of time when huge sand dunes moved slowly across the edge of a continent. There not many fossilized bones in the DeChelly, but there are numerous fossilized track ways of Permain Age creatures (both vertebrate and invertebrate). The ultra runner today may find the course difficult, but the arthropod racers of 260 million years ago had it much worse.\n\nRace Day The Monument Valley Ultras — 100 miles, 50 miles and 55 km — all start near the Monument Valley visitor center that sits on the lip of a small cliff overlooking the iconic Mittens. The runners gathered at 6:45 am for a traditional Navajo prayer welcoming the new day. The prayer, the approaching sun rise, a perfect temperature of 39 degrees, and the energy of the runners creates an emotional aura. Two weeks before the race, Monument Valley received a record snow fall during a late season storm. There was some question as to whether the race would follow the traditional course as flooding from the melting storm closed much of the Valley. However, everything reopened days before the race; the 55 km course followed a quick descent along a sweet single track that looped around the West Mitten before joining the main Monument Valley tour road. For the first couple of miles I run a pace of about 9;45 minutes per mile – a little faster than I want given the long day ahead, but there never is any way to calm the emotion! One of the biggest surprises to to me in the first couple of miles is seeing the Mittens from all angles. Although they look like large buttes, they are actually very thin monuments. Viewed from the start of the race the West Mitten is a couple of hundred meters across, but when I pass the western extreme I see that the West Mitten is only a few 10s of meters wide. Although the race started in the glow of pre-sunrise, soon the sun is lighting up the cliffs of DeChelly sandstone. The reds and browns glow – the promise for a great run.\n\nThere are a few tour vans on the Valley road, and tourists are busy taking pictures in the early morning light. I roll into the main aid station, called Hogan, at 58 minutes. The total distance covered is 5.75 miles, so I am feeling pretty good. The 55 km course is shaped like a 4-leafed clover with the Hogan aid station at the center – I will pass through it four times today. I am trying to run the course today with minimal aid station support – I only want to refill my water bottles, and I carry all the food I will need. Turns out this is not a great idea – the food looks pretty good at Hogan!\n\nAfter a quick fill of my water bottles (and longing gazes at the food – I decide to stick to my plan, and eat a lemon wafer I am carrying), I start the second clover leaf, a relatively short 5 mile loop, almost all on a wonderful single track. I roll back into the Hogan aid station at 2 hours (10.5 miles), and began a much longer loop towards Hunt’s Mesa. The first couple of miles are along the Valley road, and pretty easy. However, the course then begins to follow a very sandy trail/road route. I had hoped that the recent snowfall would have made the sand semi-compact and easier to run. Wrong. The fine grained sand does not hold moisture, and it is a leg burner! The course passes a series of slender monuments – the tallest of which is called the Totem.\n\nI ponder the fate of the Totem; it is an inverted pendulum, and will eventually fall. It is clear that there has not been any significant earthquake activity for a couple of thousand years near Monument Valley, or the precarious nature of Totem would most certainly have caused it to tumbled. I guess it will stand for a few thousand more years. Assuming there are ultra runners in a few more millennia, they will not experience the Totem. Miles 14-18 are sandy. The cliffs of the DeChelly sandstone are rounded by the abrasion from the winds. Today is a rare and fortunate day – little wind. The wind of Monument Valley picks up the fine gains of sand and silt that had eroded from the Permian sediments and slams them into the cliff faces. This constant assault eventually carves the rocks into bridges and arches.\n\nThe route takes us to an amphitheater-arch call the “Big Hogan”. It is a wonderful example of the power of saltation. The wind has carved an amphitheater, and at the top has cut an arch – like the smoke hole in a hogan, hence the name.\n\nThe route eventually loops back to the Hogan aid station. The mileage for the third visit is almost exactly 20 miles. My time is 4 hrs and 6 minutes. A little slower than I planned, but considering the sand and all the time I took out to take pictures, I am pretty much on schedule. Once again, I look at the great selection of food laid out at the aid station and regret my stubborn dedication to minimal support. Out of the Hogan aid station the last loop is an out and back to the top of Mitchell Mesa — before me is the most difficult climb in the run. The trail leads west along a road cut to support a uranium mine on the the top of Mitchell Mesa back in the 1960s.\n\nDuring the uranium frenzy of the 1950s, amateur and professional prospectors fanned out across the Colorado Plateau in search of the metal that fueled the nuclear age. There are numerous small uranium deposits located in old river channels within the Shinarump formation. These old channels captured carbon debris – trees, branches, decomposing leaves, etc. – which in turn served to precipitate uranium out of circulating ground waters. One of these ancient river channels cuts across Mitchell Mesa, and was mined briefly in the period 1962-1965. The mine’s operation came to an abrupt end when the operator, Robert Shiver, accidentally backed the ore hauler he was driving over a cliff, and tumbled more than 450 feet into the valley. The same cliff that took Shiver’s life is the one that we have to climb to get to the top of Mitchell Mesa!\n\nThe ore from the mine on Mitchell Mesa was primarily Tyuyamunite – a rare uranium-vanadium oxide (chemical formula: Ca(UO2)2V2O8·(5-8)H2O). Like many uranium minerals it is colored canary yellow. The picture above is a sample of Tyuyamunite that was found across the valley on Hunt’s Mesa. I don’t see any sign of mineralization as I grind my way up the mesa…. The climb really begins at mile 23; there is a rocky and relentless pitch that ascends 1200 feet in only a mile. I had visions that I would bound up the winding trail – wrong. It takes me 30 minutes to get to the top, and my quads are burning.\n\nThe run to the northern end of Mitchell Mesa is physically easy – but the views into the valley are breath taking, and I find myself drifting into tourist mode. Mitchell Mesa and Merrick Butte are named after a pair of prospectors that were murdered in the Valley in December, 1879. Charles Merrick had supposedly found three crude smelters built by Ute Indians to recover silver. Merrick recruited Henry Mitchell to help him find the source of the silver; legend has it that they indeed did find a rich deposit, and the prospectors were heading home with ore samples when they met their untimely demise. For years treasure hunters have searched for the lost Merrick-Mitchell mine, but it remains lost.\n\nThe run along the top of the mesa is only about a mile long, but it is difficult after the long climb. There are patches of snow in the shade of trees, and I stop twice and fill my hat with a couple of handfuls of snow. It is now about 64 degrees (at least according to my weather app), and I am really overheated. The melting snow cools my hot head, and steels me for the last 9 miles of the run.\n\nThe turn around point is the end of the Mesa. There is a hole punch that you apply to your bib, and turn around and retrace your steps back to the Hogan aid station. The view from the turn-around point is down to the finish line — so close, yet so far. I am pretty tired at this point, and my pace is slow. I pass lots of runners still making their way to the turn-around point, and I realize that although I have been pretty much running alone for hours, there are people that are going to finish several hours after I do. The descent off Mitchell Mesa is much more difficult than I expect – no springy legs hoping from rock to rock for me! I get to the Hogan aid station for the final time about 7 hours and 14 minutes. There is still a little less than four miles to go – argh. The last part of the run is completely along the Valley tour road. Unlike earlier in the morning, the road is now heavy with traffic. The speed limit is 15 miles per hour, and many of the cars and tour vans honor the limit, which minimizes the dust. However, every fourth or fifth car comes zooming by, and stirs up a chocking cloud of red dust. I really hate this part of the run, and curse at drivers that are obvious to the runner’s fate. The last two miles of the run are a steep climb back up to the lip of the cliff where the race started at dawn. I finish at 8 hours and 10 minutes by my watch – 40 minutes slower than I planned, but I am just happy to done! My watch says 33.5 miles, so it is just short of 55 km. Within a few minutes of rest I begin to think about how great the run was, and even the dust of the tail end begins to seem not so bad. A wonderful place to have a trail run.\n\nMy Forrest Gump Moment I discovered trail running late in life. Not mountains, geology, the solitude of towering peaks and deep canyons – those have been with me since my earliest memories. But trail running is a too recent passion, but has allowed me to experience calm even as my muscles ache and I experience true exhaustion. I am not a competitive runner – oh sure, I wish I was fast, but my age and athletic ability preclude even the allusion of “competitive”. So, why run as hard as you can during an ultra run if you have no chance of being competitive? Because it is a grand challenge – ultra train races are hard, and pushing your limits are rewarded with the knowledge that you accomplished something difficult. That sounds a bit trite, but doing difficult things, accomplishing goals, are a reality check on realizing one’s potential. Like most everyone, I have much grander goals in life than just running long distances on dusty trails; I want to make a difference in the world, I want to discover, I want to make right. Those goals are pretty hard to evaluate except post-mortem, and once I am dead I don’t much care. But doing difficult things allows me to center; accomplishments are mileage posts along the way.\n\nThis past January I had my annual physical (I will soon be 59). Once you pass the half century mark the ritual of the annual physical is aways approached with trepidation. Most American medial studies define “old age” as an onset of a plethora of symptoms, usually beginning sometime between 60 and 70 years. The most frightening of these symptoms is the decline of cognitive abilities – slowing down of the brain and gradual memory lose, for example. Everyone is different, and the decline is certainly a broad spectrum, but just as erosion will eventually wear down Mt. Everest to a nub, brains do wear out. So, at each annual check up I listen attentively to my doctor hoping to hear that I am amazingly young for “my age”. My check up in January started more or less as always – I have great heart function, good cholesterol, I seem to have good hearing except when my wife asks me to do something, still have most of my hair, etc. However, when the final part of my blood test was discussed my doctor said that my thyroid was pretty much kaput. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism – an under active thyroid – a little over a decade ago. I have been taking levothroxin everyday for that decade. This is a synthetic hormone replacement; over the years my dose of levothroxin has been increased, so it was clear my thyroid was declining. I did not receive the news of “kaput” well – I was assured that this is okay, but I needed increase my medication, and monitor it closely. Hypothyroidism is not particularly rare – a few percent of Americans experience it, and both my parents had it. But it does have consequences – the thyroid helps regulate many functions in the body (including hair loss, which I appear to be immune to), but to athletes it is the key to fatigue, and to recovery from endurance events. In fact, there is a mini-scandal in world of endurance racers with the suggestion that some elite runners are using levothroxin to enhance performance. That has never been my case! But now I began to question if I would be able to truly run, bike or swim anymore. Was this the onset of old age for me?\n\nThe Monument Valley ultra was my first race since my new medicine regime. As I lined up on the start line I could not help but wonder if I could actually do the race. However, I ran it just fine (well, my legs are not so sure it was just fine). Unlike Forrest Gump, I am not ready to stop running.\n\nShades of grey wherever I go\n\nThe more I find out the less that I know\n\nBlack and white is how it should be\n\nBut shades of grey are the colors I see\n\nBilly Joel, Shades of Grey, released 1993.\n\nIn the mid 1980s I was first asked to be a judge of the competitive mineral exhibits at the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show. At that time the TGMS competition, and its two top awards – the McDole Trophy (best case of minerals entered into competition) and the Lidstrom Trophy (best individual mineral entered into competition) – were considered the pinnacle of the mineral world. The winners of these awards looked like a “Who’s Who” of the mineral collecting community, and every year the competition was passionate and savage. The rules for the McDole and Lidstrom awards were few; it was based on the judges experiences, biases, and an element of luck on who decided to enter the competition. The judging for the McDole and Lidstrom awards was also a “discussion” rather than some type of formal poll — a judge with a domineering personality could filibuster the other judges into accepting his or her opinion. I recall clearly the discussion around a particular specimen entered into the Lidstrom competition that I was fond of; “We can’t possibly consider that specimen a best – it has been repaired!” The pronouncement carried such an air of academic certitude that I immediately agreed. Of course, it had been repaired! How could it really be a great mineral specimen if there was some glue involved!\n\nIt was not too long after that I began to ponder the absurdity of dismissing anything that is repaired as inherently flawed (on a personal note, now that I have multiple metal parts in various joints, I embrace the repaired). Repairing a mineral is rather common – mineral extraction is inherently a violent activity, and the very act of handling a specimen introduces the possibility of drops, dings and scratches. But there is still a feeling that repairs should affect the monetary value of a specimen. I don’t think I have ever been to mineral show where I have not heard some version of the conversation between a dealer and a collector where the potential purchaser doesn’t ask for a significant discount because the specimen has been repaired. The stephanite pictured at the top of this article is a fantastic complex crystal from the Husky Mine in the Yukon Territory, Canada. I first committed to buying this piece for my collection around the year 2000. However, when I went to go pick it up from the dealer I opened the box and the marvelous sample of “brittle silver” was in three pieces! The stress of transport had caused the crystal to part along inter-growth boundaries. I was heart broken, and walked away from a masterpiece. The dealer repaired the piece expertly, and eventually I was able to acquire it. However, several years later I was transporting it to be photographed and it “parted” again! Fortunately, it was once again restored, and now sits permanently in my mineral cabinet never to travel again. I believe it is the best, or one of the best, Husky Mine stephanites in existence, and the fact that it has some clear cyanoacrylate helping to hold it together is inconsequential.\n\nRepair would, thus, seem to be a rather “black and white” issue – restoring a collectable to its original configuration is not fraud or even misrepresentation of nature. Sadly, it is not “black and white”, and repair/restoration has become a spectrum disorder in the mineral collecting world. Today many consider filling missing gaps in crystals with acrylic resin, buffing away scratches on crystal faces or even heating a specimen to “restore” its primordial color as simply “sophisticated repair”. Not black and white, but shades of grey.\n\nReal Repairs\n\nThe Pieta is a signature masterwork of Italian sculptor Michelangelo, and one of the most famous works of art in history. Michelangelo was only 23 years old when he carved the single block of Carrara marble into a haunting image of a crucified Jesus being held by his mother. By any figure of merit, the Pieta is priceless. Yet, it is repaired – several times! The four fingers of Mary’s left hand were snapped off during a move in the 18th century (restored in 1736). The most egregious damage occurred in an instant of insanity when Laszio Toth, an unemployed Hungarian geologist attacked. Toth struck the Pieta more than a dozen times with his field hammer, breaking off Mary’s arm, part of her nose, and chipping her face.\n\nThe repair of the statue was done by a team of 10 people painstakingly reassembling the fragments and filling in voids with a mixture of powdered marble and polyester resin. When the restore work was unveiled it was claimed that it was impossible to identify where the damage had been. Some experts suggest that with the passage of time the resin has perceptibly changed color, but in general the repair has faded into history and the magnificence of the Pieta has been restored.\n\nThe restoration of the Pieta might be a fanciful stretch as an analogy for mineral repair, but it does frame the philosophy of specimen “value”. It is highly unlikely that the reconstruction of Mary’s left hand would effect the value of the Pieta if the Vatican decided to part with the treasure; I can’t imagine any art collector asking the Vatican for a “discount” because the marble was not exactly as Michelangelo carved it long ago. On the other hand, the restoration process went to great lengths to assure that nothing changed from the original – no added expression to Mary’s face, no extra lamb seated at her feet.\n\nThe Rhodochrosite Royalty – a family full of plastic surgery\n\nIn 1966, a 90 year old silver mine located on the slopes of Mt Bross – one of Colorado’s 53 peaks that have elevations in excess of 14,000 feet above sea level – yielded a remarkable mineral specimen. The mine was called the Sweet Home, and during its on-again, off-again mining history had periodically produced some of the world’s best rhodochrosite. However, the standard for rhodochrosite was reset when a mining crew drilled into a pocket and found a 10 cm rhombohedron of cherry red rhodochrosite perched on a slab of pencil thin white quartz. The specimen was purchased by one of Colorado’s earliest fine mineral dealerships, Crystal Gallery, for the princely sum of $2500. Crystal Gallery was a partnership between Merle Reid and Colorado collector legend George Robertson. The rhodochrosite ended up in the hands of Peter Bancroft (much to the chagrin of George Robertson), who christen the piece as the “Alma Queen”, in recognition of the mining town a few miles southeast of the Sweet Home Mine (the picture above is “official” photo of the Alma Queen from its present home, the Houston Museum of Natural Science). In short order the Queen passed through a hands of a number of famous mineral dealers, finally becoming a prized possession of Perkins Sams. In 1986, Sams sold the Queen to Houston Museum – and a few years later it was being moved and was broken! Actually, it was not too surprising given that the rhodochrosite has perfect cleavage, and the huge crystal was isolated and perched on matrix. Fortunately, the crystal was “repaired” – it is impossible to see the glue reattaching the rhomb – and is still considered a masterpiece.\n\nThe Alma Queen enticed others to want to return to the Sweet Home Mine and search for more rhodochrosite. In 1991 Bryan Lees and partners began a professional and systematic exploration for mineral specimens. In 1992 Lees’ operation discovered a 1.5 meter long pocket that yielded incredible — larger than even the Alma Queen — specimens. Most of the crystals were detached from matrix, jarred from their natural perches by the mining activity. The largest of the crystals was more than 15 cm across, and was dubbed the Alma King.\n\nThe Alma King was eventually reattached to matrix, and was brought to the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show in 1993. I remember seeing the specimen, and was stunned. I also recall standing next to a old time collector who remarked “too bad it is repaired”. Wow – my thoughts were not conflicted at all – the repair was sincere and returned a natural masterpiece to it’s rightful magnificence. It was exactly like the restoration of the Pieta!\n\nThere is little argument that the repair of the Sweet Home rhodochrosites was the right course of action, and certainly did not diminish the value of the specimens. However, it also coincided with the crest of a darker tsunami in the collecting hobby that demanded specimen perfection, and art aesthetics overtaking all other metrics of mineral specimen evaluation. A significant percentage of the Sweet Home specimens required repair, although the evolving euphemism was “specimen preparation”; a dialog developed around the theme of “returning the specimen to the condition it was in nature”. This catch phrase has become the a divide between collectors; those that prize the art of mineral specimens are willing to see flaws removed by polish and resins, while other collectors recoil at any man-induced enhancements and celebrate only that which can be documented “as found”. This gulf is wide, and brings cries of “fake and fraud” from collectors in the later group when they view many of the world’s best mineral specimens. However, this group of collectors – the old school – is dying away. Not yet irrelevant, but mostly marginalized. I am old school.\n\nWhen a grey line becomes red — and crossed\n\nIn the last 50 years the mineral collecting hobby has seen dramatic changes – or perhaps evolution. What was once the realm of rockhounds is now a glided age of art. One of the most obvious symptoms of this change is what collectors accept and expect in a mineral specimen. Repair and restoration have always been important for mineral specimens; however, the definition of repair and restore has changed as prices have escalated. There has always been a desire to make specimens attractive, but today it is expected that many specimens are oiled, waxed or sprayed with silicon to enhance their luster and hide their imperfections. Use of these cosmetic trappings was once a “red line” for collectors – absolutely rejected. But just like US foreign policy on the use of chemical weapons, that red line was faded to grey. A tour through the many hotel rooms of the “high end” mineral dealers participating in the 2015 Westward Look Fine Mineral Show in Tucson (February 6-8) reinforces this dramatic shift; it is fair to say that most expensive fluorite specimens for sale have been treated with oil, every recent amazonite dug from the pegmatites in the high peaks of Colorado has been “juiced” to enhance the luster, and most gem-quality garnets are getting at least a spray of enhancement. And, further, casual conversation with collectors seems to reinforce that this is what they want. Perfection is essential for a work of art.\n\nThe desire to “improve” minerals is a couple of thousand years old. There is written accounts of Greeks using cedar oil on emeralds to enhance the color. The purpose of the oil was to fill the flaws and cracks with a material (the oil) such that when light is shined on the crystal there would not be reflections from the imperfections. The cedar oil had approximately the right index of refraction (about the same as the emerald itself), and low enough viscosity (when heated) to flow into the tiny cracks, but high enough such that it would remain (at least for a while) after treatment. Today the oil is mixed with a polymer which “fixes” the oil. There are about a half dozen “restoration” labs in the US that work on minerals, and most have proprietary processes to do essentially the same thing as the cedar oil treatment except for fluorite, sphalerite, garnet, etc. The science behind these processes is fairly sophisticated — but the treatment is rarely disclosed.\n\nToday it is hard to “lay blame” for the practice of mineral restoration that relies on removing perceived imperfections at the doorstep of dealers. The nature of the “trophy collector” is to find perfection – and that sense of perfection does not have to be the hand that nature dealt. Further, it is clear that repair and restoration no longer decrease specimen value, but actually increase value. As Sir Walter Scott opined: Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive.\n\nOld School with a New World Order\n\nI love collecting minerals – it is something that I have done with passion for more than 50 years. I have changed along the way, and the hobby has changed even more than I. I am deeply disturbed by many of the changes, but that does not make them “wrong”. Just as I am aghast at at what I perceive as the personal values of generations other than mine, my sense of why I collect, and what a mineral specimen means to me, does not have to be shared with others. The Dalai Lama says: “Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.” I don’t need to change what and how I collect. It is the science and human story that are codified and crystallized in my minerals. That is why I happily collect that which is repaired and total reject oils and waxes. A red line.\n\nBeauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears, Edgar Allan Poe, 19th century American Poet.\n\nThere are certain minerals that hypnotize the collector – some with their monetary value, some with their art esthetics, and others with their specimen fame and history. A few appeal to a most primal attraction, a fascination with a rich and distinctive color. Perhaps no species in the mineral kingdom has a more unique and appealing hue and chroma than proustite; vermillion-scarlet red, appearing to glow under moderately bright light, yet fleeting and fading with time. In Mexico and Chile, miners use the phrase “Sangre de Toro” – the Blood of the Bull – when they encounter freshly broken rock that exposes proustite (or the closely related mineral pyargyrite). These miners celebrated the rock bleeding with rich silver ore.\n\nA “great proustite” is prized in any mineral cabinet, and is considered an essential in a great mineral collection. However, proustite is enigma to most collectors — beautiful, but it poses very special challenges in terms of curation. Proustite is well known to darken on exposure to light – mainly sunlight, but also on exposure to the light from most electrical bulbs found in mineral cases. Proustite is probably the only mineral that is proudly advertised as “stored away in a dark box for the last 100 years”. A great mineral that no one every gets to observe? By far, proustite is the mineral I get questioned must intensely about; Can you reverse the darkening? Why does my proustite that I leave boxed up develop a white coating? Can I find display glass for my mineral case that will block damaging light? Unfortunately, the same chemistry and physics that endows the mesmerizing color to proustite leads to its ultimate demise.\n\nI bought my first fine proustite in 1983 at the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show — or more correctly, I bought it late one evening in a dingy hotel room in the Desert Inn located a few blocks west of the TGMS show. The crystal is about 3.8 cm high, and distinctive in its habit; there is no question that it was from Chanarcillo, Chile. I was introduced to an English mineral dealer named Simon Harrison, who was reported to have a fine proustite. Simon took me into the bathroom to show me the piece — I recall that the bathtub was filled with ice and cans of beer, and there were mineral flats stacked high — and as I opened the box I was incredibly excited (the crystal is shown at the top of this article). Inside was a perfect prismatic crystal, fantastic color, and an retired British Museum of Natural History label. Reality splashed over me as I realized this piece was probably out of my meager means — having just completed my PhD, and was only notionally visualizing what a “paycheck” was. He told me the price was 3000 dollars – cash, no stink’in checks. I quickly said yes, but had no clue where I was going to find 3k. I had three flats of pretty good material in my car out front, and I hoped to sell them in the next couple of days. I was incredibly lucky that I was able to cajole a dealer to take them all for 3,800 dollars, and I became the proud owner of a piece of ruby silver.\n\nI showed my treasure to a number of friends and colleagues and the everyone told me it was great, but that I had to keep it closed up tight in a box, and make sure it never saw the harsh and bright Tucson sunlight (I recall thinking that perhaps everyone was confusing the proustite with a miniature vampire…). I stored it away, and was happy. Two years later I opened up the box to show a friend, and I was dismayed to see a white powder near the base of the crystal. The color seemed as great as ever, but what the heck was the white powder, and what did it portend for the demise of my great specimen? I removed the white powder with a tooth brush and x-rayed it; I found it was arsenic oxide. This seemed mysterious to me, and started me down a path of understanding the complex chemistry and physics of proustite.\n\nSince that first purchase long ago, I have added about 15 proustites to my collection. I love the species, and even occasionally show the pieces. I have also probably been asked a hundred times on how to reverse the aging of proustite; sadly, just like the human body, a grand chemistry experiment is going on all the time, and although it is possible to delay the darkening of the crystal, the majestic color will eventually change. It is not a mystery, but a testament to the wonderful properties of the element silver.\n\nThe next two sections of this post are about the structure and color of proustite – they require some faith in quantum mechanics, and for some readers it is best to just jump to the section on The World’s Great Proustite Localities.\n\nThe structure of proustite; silver sulfides and sulfosalts all die and go to heaven\n\nThe color of proustite, and the fact that it fades and decomposes on exposure to sunlight, is a result of its chemistry and crystal structure. The chemical formula for proustite is Ag3AsS3, which represents the arsenic end-member of a solid solution series with the “dark ruby silver” pyrargyrite (Ag3SbS3). From a chemical point of view, the proustite-pyrargyrite series is one of the simplest silver-bearing sulfosalt systems. “Simple,” however, is relative when dealing with anything that contains silver. For example, in the laboratory it is possible to make antimony-rich proustite; yet in natural proustite, only a tiny fraction of the arsenic is actually replaced by antimony.\n\nThe crystal structure of proustite contains covalently bonded As-S3 pyramids, which are stacked in a spiral parallel to the c-axis of the crystal. The silver atoms are situated between the As-S3 pyramids, and link the over and underlying pyramids via S-Ag-S bonds. The figure above shows the packing, and the resulting crystal symmetry. The stack of the unit cells gives a hexagonal structure (in the ditrigonal pyramidal class). Proustite crystals are typically highly modified scalenohedrons – often they resemble “dog-tooth” calcite crystals.\n\nThe classical representation of the atomic interactions in the unit cell does not capture the complexity of proustite very well; it is important to take a quantum view, more fully appreciating that the silver atoms are fickle with their attachment to a given sulfur atom. Below is an individual proustite molecule presented using Einstein’s model for the harmonic displacement of atoms. The ellipsoids represent an envelope of space with a certain probability that the atom is inside; in the figure sulfur is shown in yellow, arsenic in green, and silver is the in silver (of course!). The silver atoms have the largest ellipsoids — in fact, larger than the entire As-S3 pyramid dimension — reflecting the fact that silver wanders within the structure.\n\nIn the classical description of the proustite structure a given silver atom interacts with two sulfur atoms (on the over and underlying As-S3 pyramid). However, if you consider the interactions of a given Ag atom with the neighboring six sulfur atoms, it is possible to define a very distorted AgS6 octahedral group.\n\nIn this representation two of the S atoms are much closer to the silver atom as compared to the other four (making the silver 2-coordinated). The other 4 sulfur atoms form a plane around the Ag, defining a “cage”. When the silver atom experiences thermal motion it bounces back and forth between the four sulfur atoms undergoing short periods of being bonded to each of them. This can lead to strong silver migration within the proustite structure — and this is the root cause of the deterioration of proustite on exposure to light!\n\nThe mobility of silver in sulfides and sulfosalts is described as a thermal effect, which usually leads one to the conclusion that physical heating is required. In fact, the thermal motion of the silver atoms can be excited by radiation, including visible light. When light shines on proustite the unit cell increases in volume; this volume is accommodated in the c lattice parameter, meaning that the distance between the As-S3 pyramids in adjacent layers increases, promoting a reaction that liberates the arsenic which reacts with the atmosphere to produce As2O3 – the white powder that is sometimes seen on proustite. The light also mobilizes the silver, which typically combines with the sulfur to form acanthite. The “darkening” of proustite on exposure to light is actually the surface growth of acanthite and silver.\n\nThe chemical changes associated with light degradation of proustite are irreversible. Once the silver migrates and reforms on the surface as a new sulfide, the host proustite is forever changed. The “darkening” of the proustite is in fact a surface coating, and it can be removed with silver cleaner, although this “cleaning” leaves a pitted and damaged surface.\n\nThe mobility of silver in proustite is hardly unique; in fact, all silver sulfides and sulfosalts are temperature sensitive. The classic example is the growth of silver wires out of acanthite. Recently, there have been a large number of “constructed” silver wire specimens from Morocco and China where acanthite crystals have been blow-touched to liberate bright curls of silver. The same thing happens to proustite when point heated, something that has been know since the 19th century when the figure above was published (criminal, blow-touching a proustite crystal!).\n\nThe color red – band gaps\n\nThe structure of proustite is also responsible for its marvelous color. It also requires a detour through quantum mechanics to understand how electrons behave with energized. Proustite is a semiconductor, and thus its color is controlled by the energy of electrons and the “band theory of metals”. The main tenet of band theory is that the outermost electrons of the atoms within the mineral belong to the crystal as a whole. For pure metals, such as silver and gold, each atom contributes the electrons in their outer orbits to a “pool”; these electrons are free to move throughout the crystal, and this results in high thermal and electrical conductivity, and metallic luster. For semiconductors – like proustite – there is a prevalence of covalent bonding, or electron sharing. This limits the mobility of electrons, and there are gaps in energy between the covalence band and a band that would be required for the true electronic sharing (the conduction band). The size of this energy gap controls the color of the semi-conductor.\n\nFor metals, the electron pool absorbs energy from incident light and the electrons are excited to higher energy levels; the electrons return to their native lower energy state and emit a photon of energy proportional to the difference between the excited and native levels. For gold, the electrons have a strong absorption of energy at 2.3 eV, which we observe as yellow. For silver, the absorption peak is at about 4 eV, which is closer to the ultraviolet – so all the visible spectra is returned and the metal acts like a mirror. Hence the shiny, nearly white color of the metal.\n\nFor semiconductors, it is only possible to absorb the energies of incident light at all energies above the band gap, but not below. If the gap is very small, the color appears black. If the gap is very large, no absorption occurs, and the mineral appears colorless. Diamond has an energy gap of 5.5 eV, well beyond the spectra of visible light. Proustite has an intermediate gap – about 2 eV — and therefore only red light is transmitted; all other colors have energies larger than Eg and thus, are absorbed. Pyrargyrite has slightly smaller gap (the difference between a covalent bond with antimony vs arsenic) and therefore is slightly darker.\n\nThe unique hue of proustite is a product of silver-sulfur bonds competing with the arsenic-sulfide pyramids. Since most silver sulfides and sulfosalts are similarly constructed, they all have a red color. We tend to think of minerals like miargyrite and polybasite as “black”, but in fact their streak is red.\n\nThe World’s Great Proustite Localities\n\nProustite is known from thousands of localities, but only a paltry half dozen have produce collector specimens of note. Proustite and pyrargyrite are generally late forming minerals in hypogene (high temperature and pressure fluids) environments, although occasionally there found in supergene (near surface, and typically controlled by meteoric waters) environments. Proustite is considerably rarer than pyrargyrite; both minerals are typically dispersed in smallish grains within vein systems. The abundance of proustite in world-wide silver localities portends that there should be exceptional crystals from many localities. However, macro-crystals are quite rare except at Chanarcillo, Chile and near Schneeberg, Germany.\n\nChanarcillo: The undisputed heavy weight champion of proustite localities is Chanarcillo, Chile. Between 1850 and 1875 an extraordinary number of terminated, undamaged proustites were recovered in veins of calcite. The largest of these crystals is reported to be more than 9 cm in length, and hundreds of specimens are known in museums and private collections across the globe that are long prismatic candles of red in excess of 5 cm length.\n\nThe Chanarcillo deposits are located south of Copiapo, about halfway between Antofagasta and Santiago, Chile, in the Atacama Desert. In May 1832 a freight hauler and prospector named Juan Godoy was hunting Ilamas when he tired and decided to rest under the shade of an outcrop. Godoy noticed a waxy vein and began to pry the vein material out with his knife – he later described it as “soft as cheese”. He loaded up two mules with the ore — chlorargyrite — and headed to the nearby town of Copiapo to have it assayed. Godoy entered into partnership with a friend, Juan Callejos Miguel Gallo, and founded the Descubridora mine. Rumors of the richness of the strike started a rush to Chanarcillo, and by 1850 there were 1,750 mires in the district. Unfortunately, the story of Godoy ends sadly, in the way of many prospectors; Miguel Gallo became immensely wealthy, but Godoy squandered his share of the Descubridora and died a beggar.\n\nThe Descubridora Mine produced the largest and best native silver specimens from Chanarcillo. Much of the silver occurred as thick wires encased in calcite, but the most characteristic habit is arborescent “flags” or herringbone plates of crystals. Two other mines produced specimens of note: the Mina Dolores Tercera and the Bolados. The Dolores is perhaps the most famous to mineral collectors, and during the 1850s the lower levels of the mine encountered a series of vugs filled with proustite, acanthite and chlorargyrite. The Bolados (named after four brothers who discovered it) contained huge masses of native silver — one of these weighed an estimated 1,360 kilograms, and had to be hand-chiseled from the mine because black powder blasts only dented and bent the lode. Another Bolados bonaza pocket contained chloragyrite and silver weighing 20,450 kilograms!\n\nThere were 18 major mines in Chanarcillo that produced more than $90 million (as measured in 1875 dollars) worth of silver in aggregate. Most mining was abandoned by the end of the nineteenth century due to the exhausting of the ore. There were periodic attempts to revive the camp in the camp in the 20th century, but this only resulted in all the dumps being hauled away for processing. Every trace of mineralization has been chipped away from the tunnels and open workings. I visited Chanarcillo in 2001, and was amazed how little remained. The value of the proustite is not lost on the locals; if you travel to Copiapo and inquire about buying proustite, someone will show up at your hotel room with red-colored rock and asking price of thousands of dollars. Sadly, no new proustite has been recovered in more than a century.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of Chanarcillo proustites stored away in museums, and occasionally returned to the collector world. About 12 years ago a large proustite was traded out of the Harvard Museum; as traded it was an ugly clod. It was a mass of calcite with glimmers of proustite. The dealer made the trade with the hope that the removal of the calcite would reveal a masterpiece. In fact, it revealed many masterpieces! During the cleaning it also revealed some material that looked like red mica. Testing confirmed it was fettelite, a rare silver-mercury sulfosalt (Ag16HgAs4S15). Fettelite was only described in 1994, and all the known material was flakes less than .2 mm across. However, the “cleaned” Harvard piece yielded crystal books to .7 cm! I was fortunate to acquire the very best of these (before others decided that these should be really expensive since they were the world’s best!).\n\nSchneeberg/Schlema: The Erzgebirge — translates as the ore mountains – is a fault block mountain range that forms the border between southeastern Germany and the Czech Republic. For mineral collectors, The Erzgebirge is a mineral locality of mythical proportions; Freiberg, Marienberg, Annaberg, Jachymov, Johanngeorgenstadt, Pöhla and Schneeberg. These mines operated for centuries, and gave birth to modern mining geology, engineering and mineralogy. These mines produced a larger volume of world class silver minerals than any where else on the globe – and so many of these specimens are preserved because of the rise of gentlemen naturalist that were ravenous collectors in the 18th century had access to these marvels.\n\nProustite is found throughout the Erzgebirge, but a series of mines in the Schlema valley produced the very best specimens. The town of Schneeberg sits at the western end of a small valley — about 5 km long — that drains into the Zwickau Mulde (river). Within this modest strip of land sits the Schlema-Hartenstein and Schneeberg mining districts. Silver was known to have been mined in the area from at least since the beginning of the 15th century, and the first major discovery occurred in 1470. Within 4 years there were 176 mines recorded to be producing silver. The most famous of the early mines was the St. Georg; in 1477 a large lode of native silver and various silver sulfides was discovered which is said to have contained 20,000 kg of silver. A large slice of this lode exists today in the Senckenberg Natural History Collections, in Dresden.\n\nThe mines in the Schneeberg-Schlema area exploit a network of hundreds of veins that vary in size; the most important are over 2 km in length and 3 meters wide. The character of the mineralization within in the veins is complex which is the result of the superposition of multiple hydrothermal events over a long period of time — from the Permian to the Cretaceous. The complex mineralogy is characterized by the metals C0-Ni-Bi-Ag-U. In fact, the variety of metals also explains the long mining history of the region. Within 25 years of the first major discovery most of the silver mining had ended, but the region was revitalized in 1520 when cobalt became an important commodity to produce blue glass. In the early part of the 19th century the focus of the mining shifted to nickel, and by 1830 the uranium became a main mining target.\n\nAfter the conclusion of World War II the Soviets invested heavily in the region to mine uranium for their nascent nuclear weapons program. By the end of the 1950s East Germany was the fourth largest producer of uranium, and the Schneeberg-Schlema area is now recognized as the largest vein-style uranium deposit in the world. By the time the mines shut down in 1990 the total uranium production was more than 96,000 tonnes.\n\nAlthough the Schneeberg-Schlema mines had a complicated history in terms of the target metal, a constant through time was the occasional encounter with rich pods of silver ore. Proustite specimens were documented as being recovered from the mines for over 500 years. Many of the best specimens were recovered in the 20th century, and preserved. Unfortunately, the names of the specific mines are often obscured — in fine Soviet tradition the mines operated post WWII were donated by numbers assigned to the adits or shafts. The most famous of these shafts was “207” located in Niederschlema. WISMUT, the uranium mining enterprise, made a gift of several dozen stunning proustites from shaft 207 to the Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg (the Frieberg Mining Academy). These proustites reside in a drawer – hidden from light, but when the proustite drawer is brought out the reaction from collectors is always one of disbelief!\n\nTo Show or Not to Show\n\nProustite is a marvelous and complex mineral – to quote Winston Churchill, it is “a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma”. The unique color of proustite demands attention, but each flash of attention under the display lights inevitably permanently changes the specimen. There is no simple solution to delaying the darkening of proustite — the short wavelength end of the spectra causes the reaction to occur more rapidly, but the lattice will swell with exposure to any part of the visible light spectra. Thus, it is not possible to just install UV glass on a mineral case and assume your fine proustites will glow red for a generation. On the other hand, a brief exposure to light for an occasional display has little consequence. Judicious displays — both in frequency and out of direct sunlight – can make poustites objects to behold for at least a hundred years.\n\nA man on foot, on horseback or on a bicycle will see more, feel more, enjoy more in one mile than the motorized tourists can in a hundred miles – Edward Abbey, in Desert Solitaire\n\nI moved to Tucson late in the summer of 1983 to become an Assistant Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona. I spent 20 years in the “Old Pueblo” and lived the academic life, became curator of an outstanding mineral museum, worked on the greatest mineral show in the world (the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show), met my future wife, raised my family and saw my son become a third generation Eagle Scout. The Sonora Desert is like a cactus in bloom – beautiful but also deadly. I hated the summers that seemed to stretch from May 1st to the end of October, but the months of November and February are so extraordinary that heaven is the only description that is sufficient.\n\nA few years after I arrived in Tucson I began to ride a bike to recover from knee surgery, and discovered that long rides in the Sonoran Desert were therapeutic both for the body and soul. In the 1990s Tucson was a very bike friendly community, and you could choose rides of any flavor; climb 6500 feet up Mt Lemmon along the Catalina Highway, ride the frontage road near I-10 to the north and easily average 22-25 miles an hour, group rides, and daily commutes. My first “serious” bike was an aluminum framed Cannondale, and in 1990 I purchased a sweet steel lugged Serotta Colorado. I entered a number of the centuries, and in 1991 I signed up for one of the premier long rides, the El Tour de Tucson.\n\nThe El Tour de Tucson, which had its inaugural event in 1983, is one of the nation’s largest single day cycling events. The father of the Tour, Richard DeBernardis, wanted an epic event that captured the challenge of “riding the perimeter” of a landmark, and circling the Tucson Basin fit the bill perfectly. In 1991 the event attracted around 3000 cyclists – which seemed immense to me when I pushed my bike to the start line at the Sheraton El Conquistador on the north side of Tucson. It was a cool Saturday morning just before Thanksgiving, and riders were segregated in “corrals” based on ability – I was in the massive public corral. It took me a little less than 5 hours and 20 minutes to ride the 109 mile course that included some iconic peculiarities of the El Tour (there were two “water” crossing that require the cyclists to dismount and carry or push their bikes – mostly the crossings are about getting off the bike, but sometimes they are wet!). Cyclists that finished the course in times between 5 and 6 hours received a “gold medal”, and I only regretted that I totally bonked the last hour and imagined I barely missed out on a “platinum” medal (it is really unlikely I could have made up the 20 minutes, but that is the power of positive thinking!). I rode the El Tour again in 1994 when the temperatures at the starting time were much less than 40 degrees and froze, but still did the ride in less than 5 1/2 hours.\n\nWhen I left Tucson in 2003 I always thought I would return to ride the El Tour often — I did not find the time until 10 years later when a couple of friends from Los Alamos and I entered the 31st version of the El Tour. We headed out from New Mexico on Friday, November 22, and by the time we got to Tucson it was raining. It is not unusual to get some precipitation in Tucson in November, but the storm forecast called for a significant chance of rain during the race.\n\nIt rained overnight before the race, and was lightly sprinkling at the start of the race. Cold and wet, I waited at the start line with high expectations — how bad could it be? Well, it rained nearly continuously for 4 hours. The map above shows the rainfall totals at stations across the Tucson Basin during the race – many recorded more than 1.5″ during the race. I never had a more miserable ride – between the rain fall, the spray from other riders, and road grim that comes with big storms, the ride was a major challenge! I did the first 75 miles on pace for a 5:50 finish, but cramped up and limped home in a time of 6 hr 21 minutes, and placed 521 out of 1626 riders (the race officials pulled a large number of riders off the course because the Sabino Creek crossing became too dangerous – and thus there was a much smaller finishing cadre than usual). After a few hours of recovery, my friends and I vowed to return and conquer the El Tour in 2014 and simply celebrate the most ridiculous and wet ride we just experienced.\n\nThe 2014 El Tour de Tucson\n\nThe line up for the El Tour begins before sunrise and the sky has a faint red glow associated with the sunlight diffracting from beyond the horizon. 3200 cyclist mill around the starting line in Armory Park near the center of old Tucson just before 7 am start time for the 104 mile race/ride (the distance of the course changes from year to year depending on road construction). It is always clear that the cyclist come in all varieties — there are expensive bikes, mountain bikes, tiny people, large bodies, and some just strange sights like the fellow in a hot pink body suit. The Armory Park area dates from the the civil war when Union troops from California established a military camp here, and today it is the heart of one of the oldest Tucson neighborhoods. It is cool — 38 degrees — as the starting count down begins. I know I am pretty far back in the corral, right behind a group of riders that are wearing jerseys advertising bicycle accident lawyers (Hurt in a Biking Accident? Call xxxx). I am not sure if this is some sort of message from father fate, but I am reminded that I really have to be careful over the next 30 minutes. The countdown from 10 signals the start — and I don’t move for 3 minutes as the mass of cyclist in front of me slowly start up; it takes another 1 1/2 minutes until I pass the official start line. The mass of cyclists is amazing. Finally, I am rolling along and hugging the far left side trying to pass as many of the cyclist as possible within the first 5 minutes.\n\nTucson sits in a broad valley (with an average elevation of about 2600 ft above sea level) surrounded by tall mountains in all directions. To the east and north are the Rincon and Santa Catalina Mountains, to the west are the Tucson Mountains, and to the South are the Santa Rita Mountains. Despite the high mountains, the El Tour de Tucson is a relatively flat course – rolling hills, but less than 3000 feet elevation gain/loss for 104 miles. Of course, this is because of geology! It is a little hard to examine geology from a bike, especially during a fast moving century, but I have the advantage of knowing about the geology and that makes the ride much more interesting.\n\nThe Tucson Basin separates the crystalline cored mountains in the east (the Rincon and Santa Catalina mountains) from the mostly andesitic volcanics in the Tucson Mountains. Before about 1975 it was assumed that the Catalina-Rincon mountains were simply an uplifted batholith (granitic roots that represented large, mid-crustal depth magma chambers), but there was a perplexing rock fabric that was exposed with the granite that hinted at much more complex geologic pedigree. Around 1980, Peter Coney (an extraordinary geologist from the University of Arizona) proposed that this fabric was the result of extensive “stretching” of the crust and denuding of the deep seated rocks along low angle detachment faults. The fabric in the rock is a metamorphic (recrystallization due to extreme stains due to the crustal extension) overprint on the granites. The Catalina-Rincon mountains became the “type” locality of what geologist coined as metamorphic core complexes (MCC). When I was a young faculty member at the University of Arizona there was an intense debate on how low-angle detachment faults could form – in fact, to this day, their origin is hotly – and emotionally – contested. What makes the MMC model so significant for the Tucson Basin is that it provides an mechanism to connect the Tucson Mountains to the Catalina-Rincons; the Tucson Mountains once set on top of the Catalina Mountain rocks!\n\nThe start of the El Tour sends the riders for a short jaunt to the south before ending east and crossing the Santa Cruz River. The Santa Cruz River is a misnomer today – it is a dry ribbon of sand that only comes alive when there a large rainstorms that run off the parched desert landscape. The Santa Cruz River drainage basin covers a large area in southern Arizona, and eventually empties into the Gila River just south of Phoenix. Two major tributaries of the Santa Cruz — again, dry sandy washes most of the time – are also crossed by the El Tour. These are the Rillito River which drains the southern Catalina Mountains, and the Canada Del Oro which drains the northern Catalina Mountains. Last year all three washes were flowing with brown, churning water; this year they are sandy hiways.\n\nThe first 5 miles of the El Tour is all about survival – avoiding accidents and falling water bottles, getting ahead of wandering cyclists, and making a couple of sharp turns with cyclists of mixed experience. There is lots of shouts of “hold your line” – mostly in vain, but survive I did! After about 15 minutes the rider field is beginning to spread out, and the course turns back east; almost immediately we have our first “river crossing” — a run through the sandy Santa Cruz channel. The riders have to dismount and wade/walk/trot about 150 yards. This crossing seems crazy, but it actually spreads out the rider field.\n\nOnce I climb out of the wash I quickly get back on my back on my bike knowing that the real ride begins now. The vistas to the east are spectacular (although, in truth, my glances towards the Rincons are very brief as I mostly worry about other cyclist’s wheels). The detachment faulting that beheaded the Catalina-Rincons occurred between 30 and 20 million years before the present. Around 10 million years ago Southern Arizona was subjected to another episode of crustal extension, characterized by fairly steeply dipping faults (in opposed to the shallow dipping detachment faults) and a whole series of down dropped grabens were developed to accommodate the extension. In the Tucson area a series of high angle faults down dropped the area west of the Catalina-Rincons producing a deep basin. Subsequent erosion of the mountains has filled the basin with sediment, and the relatively flat topography of the developed area of Tucson belies the 1000s of feet of sediments filling the basin. The fast flat track of the El Tour more or less follows a contour line circling the basin.\n\nThe first hour of the bike ride is mostly uneventful; I averaged 21 miles per hour and pass at least a 1000 riders. The course loops around Tucson International Airport, and eventually turns along the frontage road of I-10. Finally, we turn north off the I-10 frontage road on to Kolb Road and cross over the massive freeway. A few minutes after the peddling along Kolb the riders pass through a unique Tucson landmark — the Bone Yard. Kolb road slices across property associated with Davis-Monthan Air Force Base that is home to the Air Force Materiel Command’s 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) – an organization charged with “dealing” with excess military and government aircraft. In reality, “dealing” with excess aircraft means miles and miles of out of service planes parked in the dry Tucson desert. As I cycled along Kolb I can see planes to the left of, planes to the right (and I am stuck in the middle with a bunch of jokers on bikes). One of my favorite planes in the line up are a few hundred B-52s that have their wings chopped off – all in the name of the START I treaty that required the US and Russians to remove a large number of delivery systems for nuclear weapons.\n\nAt about mile 29 the already huge mass of riders merges with the riders that have chosen to ride the 75 mile tour. The merger is more than vaguely related to a stream being captured by a river; the 1200+ riders that are starting the 75 mile course flow in from the left, but are slower than the passing mass of the 104 mile cyclists, so they tend to form a strip of cyclists that keeps its “identity” for at least a half a mile. The organizers plan the start times of the shorter routes such that all but the elite riders can arrive at the finish line within about a 2 hour window. This means that "
