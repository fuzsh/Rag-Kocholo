        "text": "Combined palaeoecological and sedimentological analyses of a core from a kettle-hole in Vorpom-mern (NE Germany) allow the reconstruction of the interaction between vegetation and environment during the Weichselian late Pleniglacial, Lateglacial, and Early Holocene. A humus-containing soil horizon (Reinberg horizon) occurs in the upper part of Pleniglacial sand. This humus formed in a local environment of shallow wet ponds and low dry mineral mounds. Water levels were generally rather low. Rising water levels at the beginning of the Lateglacial drowned this environment and a lake formed. The vegetation development shows a phase with an open regional vegetation (Oldest Dryas or earlier part of the Meiendorf), a period with prominence of Hip-pophaë (Bølling or later part of the Meiendorf), and a subsequent second phase with a more open regional veg-etation (Older Dryas). The sediment parameter, together with the reconstructed vegetation, point at a gradual shift to a more humid climat...\n\nThe Westphalian C was a time of marked tectonic and climatic changes within the Variscan Foreland, but our understanding of these changes is hampered by a poor appreciation of large-scale palaeogeography and palaeogeographic evolution within this key stratigraphic interval. The distribution of tonsteins, marine bands and faunal occurrences related to marine incursions or the proximity of marine conditions in Britain and on the European mainland during the Westphalian C (Bolsovian) is briefly summarised. The favoured environmental conditions of some selected fossil taxa (Lingula, arenaceous foraminifers, Geisina, conchostracan faunas and Torispora producing tree ferns) are highlighted. A palaeogeographic model shows the relationship between major sedimentary facies belts in the Westphalian C of western Europe and the influence of major marine incursions on the distribution pattern of incursion-related faunas. The frequent succession of transgressive-regressive faunal phases in beds w...\n\nThe project D4 of the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 806 at the University of Cologne deals with the study of the Mesolithic in North Rhine-Westphalia. The cultural transition from Final Palaeolithic to Early Mesolithic, the “Mesolithization”, forms one important research focus of the Mesolithic unit. This research focus currently consists of three different projects, which will be introduced in this presentation: 1. The dating of the barbed points from Dinslaken puts the artefacts at the transition from the Allerød period to the beginning of the Younger Dryas. The typo-chronological context of the points suggest a cultural connection between the Final Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers from the Rhine to the modern North Sea region and the east of England. 2. Most of the aurochs remains from Bedburg-Königshoven can be dated to the Early Preboreal and might therefore point to two different phases of the site. This early date further questions the chronological context of the lithic assemblage, which exhibits a Final Palaeolithic character, and the antler frontlets from Bedburg. Consequently, further investigations of the assemblage are required. Moreover, Amelie Scheu from the Palaeogenetics Group at the University of Mainz is analysing the well-preserved aDNA material from an aurochs at Bedburg in order to decode the genome of the European aurochs for the first time. 3. The Early Holocene assemblages of Heek-Nienborg (long blades and microliths) and Werl-Büderich (microblades and microliths) offer a special insight into the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in Westphalia. Werl-Büderich represents the earliest AMS-dated Mesolithic assemblage in Westphalia so far. Both assemblages allow a detailed study of transformations in Earliest Mesolithic silex material in this region. This detailed investigation involves an analysis of resin residues on long blades from the Heek assemblage to gain material for AMS-dating and information about tool usage. The comparison of both inventories will lead to a better understanding of possible transformations in blank production and tool function during the Pleistocene-Holocene interface.
