Anyway \"come and get them\"\n\nYou can get the same ones brand new in tool station for Â£197 never fancied them myself to much hassle as I work on my own!\n\nHoly sh1t that's cheap.i worked on my own as well.piece of cake to do,mix up.1st coat then flatten.off stilts and wash and mix 2nd coat.up and 2nd coat,flatten then wash up.then stay up until it's finished.no worries.\n\nCheapest ive seen is about Â£280 new ... I may revisit this thread if the price drops :RpS_lol: ... On a serious note though they roughly go for what your asking on ebay ...\n\nThey are good stilts though .... mine are starting to wear now and dam postage for parts from usa is stupid .. be cheaper to buy another set and keep for parts lol\n\nBought a couple of stilts in the last 8 years. But I've got to say the marshalltown skywalkers 2 are the best in my opinion. If you want a try Stuart pm me mate.\n\nBought a couple of stilts in the last 8 years.
