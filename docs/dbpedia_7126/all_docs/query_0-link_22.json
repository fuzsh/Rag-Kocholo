Souvenir OF THE North German Lloyd, Bremen. PUBLISHERS: J. REICHMANN & CANTOR BERLIN, S.W. Hedemannstr. 12. PREFACE. In presenting our book for the first time to the public, we beg to say that our aim has been to furnish a concise work of reference for the use of trans -Atlantic travellers, containing hints and directions, which we trust may prove serviceable to persons, whose time is limited. While taking pains to mention only what is considered absolutely necessary for every person to see, who makes up his mind to \"do\" Europe; we have not failed to give all such advice as may conduce to the comfort of the tourist. Our sincere thanks are due, for the cordial and valuable assistance, we have from time to time received from the various societies and Offices of Inquiry on the Continent, railway com- panies and to all those who have contributed to this work and actively aided us with information. In conclusion, we would beg all our readers, who may discover any errors or inaccuracies, which, especially in a first edition, are well nigh unavoidable, to kindly inform us of the same. That our undertaking may be fruitful of good results and may redound to the pleasure and profit of our readers and patrons, is the sincere wish of the publishers, J. REICHMANN & CANTOR. Berlin, i. January 1896. ■ '■ ' N IMD S. S. CO. I tall. w hen an historian of the future under- takes to write the history of Ger- many's transoceanic trade, an important chapter in his work will doubtless be filled by the annals of the North Ger- man Lloyd S. S. Co. of Bremen. The following short sketch of the develop- ment of the Company will illustrate how enterprise and broad-minded views have, in the comparatively brief period of a few decades, succeeded in obtaining for the „Lloyd\" the renown and domin- ant position, which it now enjoys alike in the old and the new world. The North German Lloyd, whose vessels now unite the four corners of the globe, was founded in 1857, exactly ten years after the period when for the first time a steamer, the „ Washington\", had crossed the Atlantic on her voyage from Bremen to New York. The service of the „Lloyd\", which in the beginning was carried on by but three small steamers, consisted during the first year only of one line to England. However already in the following year, the New- York line (the main object of the foundation of the Company), was opened by the despatch of the „Bremen\" with a full cargo, some steerage- passengers, and one cabin -passenger. A noteworthy success was attained the next year — ■ 1859: the „Lloyd\" was entrusted with the carriage of the Anglo-American mails. The experience which in the meantime had been gathered with regard to the cargo and passenger business, as well as the generally recognized regularity and safety of the service paved the way for a rapid growth of the Company's fleet. In 1865 the passengers con- veyed by the Company's steamers reached the number of 9714, in 1866 it became necessary to despatch a boat every week and in the following year — ten years after its foundation — the „Lloyd\" con- trolled a fleet of 14 steamers, of which 8 were engaged on the New- York line and 6 on the English line. The number of the voyages made in 1867 was 47 to America and 127 to London and Hull. These figures proved the prosperity of the undertaking and the VII ft 4 f) -ft* IS «> VIII IX Directors, anticipating the influence which the development of the Company would later on exercise on Germany's transoceanic inter- ests, justly recognized it as their duty to further promote the foreign relations of the fatherland by the creation of new services and the extension of those already existing. This period coincided with the time when the germs of the subsequent powerful growth of German industry and commerce became first apparent and when the want of regular steamship communication made itself generally felt. The second decade of the history of the North German Lloyd bears full testimony to the fact that the Company has spared no effort to accommodate itself to the altered conditions of trade. Already in 1868 the relations with North America were extended through the opening of the Baltimore line. In Baltimore the arrival of the first steamer was celebrated as an event of considerable importance. The place was „en fete\". Schools, Markets, the Custom-house and most of the shops were closed. A procession headed by the Governor and the dignitaries of both the State and the city, accompanied by United States infantry, cavalry and artillery and representatives of the different trades, clubs and societies paraded the town and at a banquet which followed, great results were confidently predicted. We now arrive at an anxious year for the Company. On the outbreak of the Franco-German war the German ports were declared in a state of blockade. The superiority of the French fleet necessi- tated, not only that the Company's ships in foreign ports should be ordered to remain there, but that those at the moment on their way home should be warned of their danger and directed to safe neutral ports. Foreign steamers had to be chartered and other heavy ex- penses incurred. But victory on land limited the period of severest trial to about three months. Gradually the ships left their foreign quarters and, taking a northerly course round Scotland ran into one of the English east -coast ports whilst awaiting an opportunity to slip across to the Weser. In October of the first year of the war even the transatlantic service was re-opened by the „Hansa\" with a full freight and a large number of passengers. To the captains and officers of the „Lloyd\" employed on these hazardous expeditions, the North Sea was as his native forests are to the Indian. They cut through the blockading cordon northwards and made their way round the perilous coast of Scotland. They steamed down the channel right through the French fleet, wrapped in friendly fogs. For reasons of policy however it is well to suppress all details of the stirring in- cidents of blockade-running and to pass in silence over acts of suc- cessful audacity and resource that might take rank with the feats performed at the ports of the short-lived Confederate States. In spite of the war the new fine from Bremen to the West Indies was opened in the autumn of 1870 and at the same time a regular connection was formed between Bremen, Rotterdam and Ant- werp. In 1871 the service to England was augmented by a third line and four years later — 1875 — the „Lloyd\", paying due regard to the German interests in South America, established a regular ser- vice to Brazil and the River Plate. At the end of the second decade of the existence of the company (1878^ it became necessary to divide the South American line into two separate services, one to Brazil I Si \"IS Ik i (Bahia, Rio de Janeira, Santos) and the qther to the River Plate (Montevideo, Buenos Aires), whereas connection with the West Indies was discontinued. The period in the development of the „Lloyd\" Company which now follows will always form an important phase in the history of navigation in general. While up to this time the aim of the steam- ship owners of all seafaring nations had been directed towards security and regularity in the services of the vessels, it now became necessary to consider a third point, via: speed — and aided by the great pro- gress made in marine engineering, a new type of vessel, the modern fast-steamer or ocean-greyhound was created. Up to this time a speed of 12—13 knots an hour had formed the average for the regular mail steamers. In 1878 however the English Guion line had a steamer constructed (the „Arizona\") whose engine developed the, until then unheard of, speed of 16 nautical miles an hour, and which at the same time was provided with the necessary accommodation to carry a great number of passengers. A new era in the art of shipbuilding and steam-navigation was thus inaugurated. Considering the enormous increase which of late had taken place in the traffic between the Old and the New World, it was evident that steamers of this speed, would, if they proved safe, soon attract pas- sengers and mails, thus securing pecuniary advantages for their owners. For the North German Lloyd, which at that time already occupied a prominent position among steamship companies, the intro- duction of the fast-steamer service was a matter of course, as soon as first experience had proved its practical feasibility. Thus the „Lloyd\" commenced in 1880 the construction of its fleet of fast- steamers which surpassing all its competitors as regards the number of the vessels employed has placed it in the front rank of the leading steamship companies of the world. On the 26th June 1881 the first fast-steamer, the „Elbe\" (16 miles per hour) was placed upon the line, she was followed in 1882' and 1883 by the „Werra\" and the „Fulda\" (16—17 miles), in 18*4 by the ,.Eider\" and the „Ems\" (17 miles), in 1886 by the „Aller\", the „Traveu and the „Saale\" (17—18 miles), in 1888 by the „Lahn\" (19 miles', in 1889 by the „Kaiser Wilhelm II\" and in 1890 by the „Spree\" and the „Havel\" (19—20 miles). The construction of the fast-steamers inaugurated also a change in the interior arrangements of the vessels. The old-fashioned monot- onous dining-rooms with a number of tables in file flanked on each side by uncomfortable benches were replaced by saloons of studied elegance and sumptuousness. In the modern dining-saloons furniture, carpets, curtains, paintings combine to form an artistic whole with the architectural disposition of the rooms. The whole outfit of the saloons has been executed by the firm of A. Bemb6 of Mainz after the designs of the Bremen architect Poppe. The period during which the fleet of fast-steamers of the „Lloyd'c was constructed coincides with another important phase in the devel- opment of German transoceanic trade, namely the establishment of the subsidized mail steamer service to Eastern Asia and Australia. In July 1885 the North German Lloyd contracted with the German government to carry on the service on all the Imperial mail-steamer XII :- •: i &d I to< -'■•. ' f, 0 0 .i The North German Lloyd Imperial Mail Steamer „Bayern\" in the Drydocks of Blohm &■ Voss, Hamburg (after being cut amidships for lengthening purposes). XIII lines which Parliament had decided should be established with the provision that all the new steamers to be placed on such lines should be built in German shipbuilding yards. The speed contracted was 12 miles for the line to Eastern Asia and for the Mediterranean line, 1172 miles for the Australian main -line and the other branch -lines. The new mail steamer service consisted of 1) main -line to Eastern Asia, 2) main-line to Australia, 3) branch-line Trieste-Brindisi-Alexandria, 4) branch-line Hongkong- Japan, 5) branch-line Sydney-Tonga Islands- Samoa Islands. The preparations for the opening of the new important services were accelerated so that as early as the 28th June 1886, the first Imperial mail-steamer, the „Oder\", could leave Bremerhaven to carry the German flag to the shores of Eastern Asia. The new steamers „Stettin\" and „Lubeck\" built for the branch-lines had already left Bremerhaven some time before. As the steamers which the „Lloyd\" possessed at the time of concluding the contract were inadequate in number and construction to the requirements of the new service, the company at once ordered three steamers for the main -lines and an equal number for the branch-lines of the Vulkan shipbuilding yards at Stettin. The new steamers, named „Preussen\", „Bayern\", „Sachsen\" and „Stettin\", „Lubeck\", „Danzig\", exceeded by far the provisions of the contract with the government as regards dimensions and speed. Already during the first years of the existence of the Imperial mail-steamer service some changes became necessary. In the first place the line between Trieste, Brindisi and Alexandria was rendered impossible on account of the sanitary conditions prevailing in Egypt. This line was therefore replaced by a line from Brindisi to Port Said. The latter existed until the year 1893 when the Mediterranean branch service was given up altogether, as it was decided that the steamers of the main-lines should in addition to Genoa (where they had called since 1887), also touch at Naples for the embarkation of mails in order to ensure a speedy despatch of the latter. In 1893 Parliament further decided that the branch line in the Pacific, which had proved of no practical value, should be discontinued and that a new branch- service from Singapore via Batavia to German New -Guinea should be carried on instead. The service of the Imperial mail lines soon showed prospects of a hopeful future. The fears which on various sides had been ex- pressed that the subsidy given by the country would only benefit the commerce of other nations, that German commerce would derive no profit from it and that the interests of the already existing lines of steamers owned by private firms, would be seriously injured, all proved without foundation The offer of cargo for the steamers was from the beginning considerably in excess of the room available. The increase in the German exports to the countries concerned has been so rapid that no doubt as to the favorable influence of the lines can be further entertained. The interests of the lines carried on by private firms have not been injured, but rather the contrary has taken place. In proof of this we beg to call the attention of our readers to the figures which they will find subjoined. The total German exports to China amounted to 141/2 millions of XIV XV marks in 1887, against 47 millions in 1893, the export to Japan has during the same period risen from 472 millions to 26 millions, and the exports to Australia have increased from 17 millions to 114 millions. As regards the lines carried on by private firms, the German Kingsin line to Eastern Asia was already in existence before the Imperial mail lines were founded. This line despatched a steamer every four weeks; but in 1887, one year after the opening of the Imperial mail lines, the Kingsin line found itself under the necessity of doubling its service. As regards the trade to Australia before the opening of the Imperial mail lines, there existed only one line, the Sloman line. This line was of comparatively little importance to German commerce, as the steamers used to embark their cargo chiefly in Antwerp and London and only in exceptional cases sailed direct for German ports when returning. The Sloman line has it is true since suspended its service, but in its place a new company, the Australian steamship company, was founded only three years after the inanguration of the „Lloyd\" lines. The German Australian company likewise maintains a fortnightly service with Australia. As regards the Imperial mail lines, the steamers soon proved too small for the goods that were offering, but a few years ago these Lines were completely provided with much larger steamers. The alterations in the construction of some of the vessels, as well as the new additions to the fleet, which for this purpose were ordered by the „Lloyd\", on the one hand represent a work in the art of ship- building, never Undertaken before to such an extent and on the other, have created a new type of steamer > which gives the fullest satis- faction. In the latter respect may be mentioned the twinscrew steamers „Prinz Regent Luitpold\" and „Prinz Heinrich\" built by F. Schichau of Danzig. As regards the re-constructions effected, the most remarkable work is the lengthening of the steamers „Bayern\", „Sachsen\" and „Preussen\" carried out by the firm of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg. Each of the three steamers was placed in a floating dock and cut through amidships just forward of the engines. The forepart of the steamer was then drawn forward by hydraulic force and a new compartment was built between the two separated parts of the vessel. — In this way the „Sachsen\" and „Bayernl< have been lengthened by fifty feet and the „Preussen\" by seventy feet. The tonnage of the two former steamers was thus augmented by about 2000 cubic metres each and that of the „Preussen\" by about 2500 cubic metres, the speed of the steamers not being impaired by the lengthening. At the end of this article our readers will find some statistical tables showing the development in the traffic of passengers and goods, as will as of the tonnage employed on the Imperial mail lines. In 1892 the jSorth German Lloyd started a special service of cargo- steamers between Bremen and New- York and between Bremen and Baltimore. For the former, denominated the „Roland\" fine, a number of new steamers were built which received the names of „Roland\", „Wittekind\" and „Willehad:'. The dimensions of these steamers have been so arranged, as to allow them to profit by the successfully completed work of deepening the Weser , to land and embank goods at Bremen instead of at Bremerhaven. The line from Bremen to Baltimore has been formed by the large steamers of the XVI U £ I XYII II „Munchen\" class, all built as recently as 1889 and 1890. These two- lines carry steerage passengers and goods, the Baltimore steamers also taking a limited number of cabin passengers. Since 1890 the traffic with New- York has been further developed by the opening of a line of fast- steamers from New- York via Gibraltar to Genoa and Naples, with occasional calls during the winter season at Algiers Return tickets for the line Bremen and New- York can be made available for the Mediterranean line and vice versa, the pas- sengers being at liberty to choose that route which according to the season and their plans best suits them. The trade with South America has also been considerably in- creased during the last few years, some new and comfortable steamers having been especially constructed for that purpose. — In the first place we ought to mention the two new saloon- steamers „Mark\" and „Pfalz\", which, provided with all modern improvements for a voyage in the tropics, form quite a new type of tropical steamer. Their con- struction also allows them to steam up the river as far as Bremen and to be despatched from the latter place instead of from Bremerhaven. Besides the steamers mentioned, the company has placed upon the River Plate line the twinscrew steamer „H. H. Meier\" and the four new steamers „Halle\", „Bonn\", „Crefeld\" and „Aachen\" especially constructed for the service to South America. The company further maintains a regular service by saloon- and cargo-steamers to Brazil (Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos). The saloon- steamers leave Bremerhaven on the 10th and the cargo-boats on the 25th of each month. In connection with the arrivals of and departures of the steamers from Santos, the North German Lloyd have recently opened a branch service for passengers (first and third class) and goods with calls at Paranagua, Sao Fran- cisco, Desterro and Rio Grande do Sul. In conclusion we should mention that the company maintain a regular summer-service to the North Sea Islands Norderney, Borkum and Heligoland. In connection with these lines fast express -trains are run to the principal inland places. These trains are despatched from and arrive at the Lloyd railway-station in Bremerhaven which is in immediate connection with the landing place of the steamers. In the preceding pages we have given a short sketch of the rapid growth of the company. Subjoined our readers will find a list of the various lines of the North German Lloyd at present in operation : I. Traffic to North America: 1) Line of fast-steamers from Bremen to New-York via Southampton. Steamers employed on this line: , , Havel*', „Spree\", „Lahn\", „Aller\", „Trave\", „Saale\", „Ems\". Departures from Bremen Tuesdays and Saturdays , from Southampton \"Wednesdays and Sundays. 2) Line of fast steamers from Genoa and Naples via Gibraltar to New- York with occasional callings at Algiers. Steamers running on this fine: „Kaiser Wilhelm II\", „Werra\" and „Fulda\". 3) Line of mail-steamers from Bremen to New-York (steamers of the Mtinchen type). 4) Roland Line from Bremen to New York. Steamers: „Roland\", „Wittekind\", „Willehad\". XVIII 5) Line of mail- steamers from Bremen to Baltimore (steamers of the Munchen type). II. Traffic to South America: 6) Bremen— Brazil via Antwerp, Oporto, Lisbon to Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos. Saloon -steamers: „Hohen- staufen\", „Habsburg\", „Salier\". 7) Branch-service from Santos to Paranagua Sao Francisco, Desterro and Rio Grande do Sul. Steamer: „Mowe\". 8) Bremen — River Plate via Antwerp, Southampton, Corunna to Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Saloon-steamers: „Mark\", „Pfalz\", „H. H. Meier\" and „Wittekind\". HI. Imperial Mail Lines: 9) Bremen — Eastern Asia via Antwerp, Southampton, Genoa, Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Singapore, Hongkong Shanghai. Steamers: „Prinz Heinrich\", „Preussen\", „Sachsen\" and „Karlsruheu. 10) Bremen — Australia via Antwerp, Southampton, Genoa, Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Adelaide, Melbourne to Sydney. Steamers: „Prinz Regent Luitpold\", „Bayern\", „01denburg\", „Gera\", „Darmstadt\". 11) Branch Line from Hongkong to Japan. Hongkong, Yokohama, Hiogo, Nagasaki and return to Hongkong Steamer : „Hohenzollern.\" 12) Branch Line from Singapore to German New Guinea. Singa- pore, Batavia, Soerabaya, Friedrich Wilhelmshafen, Stephansort, Finschhafen, Herbertshohe and Matupi. Steamer: „Stettin\". IV. Branch Line in Asia: 13) From Singapore to Deli (Sumatra). Steamer: „Sumatra\". V. European Lines: 14) Tow-boat service from Bremen to Hamburg. 15) Saloon-steamer service during the bathing-season from Bremen to Norderney and Borkum. 16) Saloon-steamer service during the bathing-season to Heligoland. 17) Line from Bremen to London direct tor passengers and cargo. 18) Line from Bremen to Hull direct for passengers and cargo. For the carrying on of the service on all these lines the North German Lloyd now owns a fleet of 78 steamers and 78 lighters of a total tonnage of 244 802 and 195 406 horse-power. The crews of the fleet represent a force of 4874 men. One of the tables at the end of this article shows of how many persons in each grade this number is composed. The maintenance of so many lines and of so numerous a fleet rendered it of course necessary that the arrangements on shore should be of a proportionate character. First of all we should mention the extensive docks and workshops for the execution of repairs at Bremerhaven. These comprise a graving-dock and other works with all modern appliances for marine engineering. The number of men constantly employed in the workshops of the North German Lloyd at Bremerhaven is about 1000. The repair works at Bremerhaven are supplemented by an establishment of a similar kind at Bremen but of a less extensive character. XIX IJ* The considerable traffic of passengers by the steamers of the Nortli German Lloyd has further developed an institution for the provisioning of the steamers which in its arrangements and extent surpasses all similar establishments of other companies. The con- sumption of provisions and beverages on the steamers of the „Lloyd\" annually reaches a value of more than 672 millions of marks. The annual consumption of coal is about 750 000 tons. Connected with the establishment for the provisioning of the steamers is the steam- laundry in which the whole ship's-linen is washed and disinfected after the return of the steamers to Bremen. The North German Lloyd also possesses its own piers in New- York. The whole of this powerful organism is controlled from the head- office of the company at Bremen. — In order to simplify the service and to secure a prompt despatch of business the following depart- ments have been created: Central Office, Passage Department, Freight Department, Provisioning Department, Insurance Department and Kiver Navigation Department. The company has provided for the welfare of its seamen and other employes, as well as for the widows and orphans of its servants by the creation of a pension-fond which has been in existence for a number of years and now possesses a capital of two millions of marks. On the 1st. January 1893 this institution was extended to include a separate pension -fund with increased endowments for the widows and orphans. The majority of the seamen of the North German Lloyd have spent many years in the service of the company. Of the total number of 4874 seamen employed on the steamers only a portion not amounting to 25% are m their first year of service, whereas 16 % are between their tenth and thirtieth year of service in the Company; as shown by the affixed table all important posts are in the hands of tried and experienced men. The numerous reports of successful cases of rescue effected at sea by the crews of the North German Lloyd are a proof of the excellent spirit which animates them. In conclusion we beg to give a translation of a letter addressed to the Company by His Majesty the German Emperor in recognition of its services. During my voyage to-day from the mouth of the Weser to Wilhelmshaven on board of the fast-steamer „Lahn\", I have had an opportunity to inspect the vessel in all her parts and to minutely observe how the service is carried on. I have pleasure to express to the management of the Company my full satisfaction with what I have seen on board of this steamer. In remembrance of the voyage and as it is the first time that my standard has been hoisted on board of a German merchantman, I will present this standard to the North German Lloyd with a desire that the good spirit which rules on its steamers may always be maintained. On board of the fast-steamer „Lahn\". Wilhelmshaven, 22nd April 1890. XX w \"^ Jn the course of my voyage this day from the Weser to Wilhelmshaven on board the Express -Steamer \"JLahn\", J have availed myself of the opportunity of inspecting the vessel in all her parts, and of carefully noticing the manner in which the service is carried on. What J have observed on board this steamer has so entirely satisfied me, that J feel desirous of expressing my full approbation to the Directors, ^s a me- mento of this trip, and this being the first occasion on which J have caused my Sfar,dard to be hoisted on board a Steamer of the German Mercantile M[arine, ) present this Standard to the Directors, with a hope that the same excellent spirit which now prevails on board the vessels of the North German Lloyd may always be maintained.

Kates for through tickets, or rates for circular tours, are arrived at by a combination of given rates. 2. Tickets are issued only for first and second class railway transportation in connection, with steamship tickets reading via the lines of the North German Lloyd. 3. The Tickets are not transferable. 4. Tickets are good 12 months from date of sale. Date of final limit is shown on cover of ticketbook. 5. The tickets are good for all regular trains. For the use of Vestibule trains, passengers holding I or II Class tickets, are required to pay the usual excess fare. For the use of sleeping cars, passengers are required to pay the regular sleeping car rate. 6. Children not over 4 years of age are carried free. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 years, are carried two on one whole ticket. For one child alone, full fare has to be paid. 7. By payment of the difference in the second and first class fares, second class passengers can change at their pleasure from second to first class. 8. Tickets must be shown to Conductors or other railway officials, when required. 9. Passengers can stop over on final limit tickets, at all stations designated on such tickets. At all other stations, stop overs are granted upon application to the Stationmaster, (Stations- vorstand) who will endorse tickets. 10. The coupons of tickets are collected either by Conductors on trains, or station officials upon arrival at destination. 11. Claims for unused booktickets or coupons should be addressed for adjustment with proper explanation to the North German Lloyd, Passage Dept. Bremen. XXVIII B. Transportation of baggage. 1. Baggage is only checked through to those stations to which a baggage tariff exists. 2. The amount of baggage carried free by the railways is in no case more than 25 kg., while on a number of railways all baggage carried has to be paid for. It is therefore advisable to send heavy baggage by ^freight\", as the time in transit is not long, and charges very reasonable. 3. Passengers having baggage destined to points beyond Berlin, Leipzig, or Vienna, and going via these points, have to make arrangements for its transfer between the different stations in these cities. 4. The presence of passengers at custom house stations, at the time of baggage examination, is absolutely necessary, as the railway companies cannot be held responsible for any loss or delay, occurring through passengers absence. XXIX The fleet of the North German Lloyd, the largest of the world, has a total tonnage of 242,481 Register-Tons. Steamers of the North German Lloyd S. S. Co.

As it is now constituted, with Prussia as the leading state, the German Em- pire extending from beyond the Rhine, to beyond the Vistula, is bordered on the South by Switzerland and Austria, from which its rivers, the Rhine, Elbe, Oder flow down, through Middle Ger- many, to the extensive sandy plain, of North Germany, to the North and Baltic seas; with several fine ports namely: Hamburg, Kiel, Liibeck, Danzig. The most beautiful parts of Germany are the Rhine, the Black forest, the Thuringian forest, the Harz, Saxon Switzerland the Bavarian highlands, the Erz moun- tains, and the Bohmer Wald, the Riesen or Giant mountains and Riigen in the Baltic. The Danube is mostly an Austrian river, but, rises in Wiirtem- berg. The present Emperor William II. is the grand-son of William I. who was proclaimed German Emperor, at Ver- sailles, 18th January 187 1. His father Kaiser Friederick, who was married to Victoria, Princess Royal of England, died after a brief reign, June 15th 1888.
