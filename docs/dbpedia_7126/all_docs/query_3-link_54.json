According to the German statutory accident insurance, 3,700 cases of lung cancer were recognized as occupationally caused since 1991. Moreover, 100 workers contracted cancer of the larynx, and 2,800 workers a quartz pneumoconiosis. (MDR Apr. 27, 2012)\n\nFederal Social Court awards former Wismut miners compensation for larynx cancer\n\nOn Aug. 18, 2004, the German Federal Social Court (Bundessozialgericht ) in a landmark ruling for the first time decided, that a compensation of cancer other than lung cancer is justified for uranium miners. In two cases, filed by former Wismut uranium miners and/or their surviving families, the Court has found that the larynx cancer developed by the miners must be seen as caused by their former occupation and therefore has to be compensated by the employers' liability insurance. The insurance had maintained that no epidemiological evidence had ever proven such causation, while only the dosimetric model by Jacobi (1995) had been used so far to support such claims. The court decisions are relevant for approx. 2000 other former Wismut miners who have contracted cancers other than lung cancer.\n\n(Aktenzeichen: B 8 KN 2/03 U R, B 8 KN 1/03 U R)\n\nSources: Bundessozialgericht: Presse-Vorbericht Nr. 46/04 (5.8.2004), Presse-Mitteilung Nr. 46/04 (18.8.2004), ap Aug. 18, 2004\n\nFederal cleanup of Wismut's uranium mine and mill sites\n\nGeneral · Saxony · Thuringia\n\nGeneral\n\n> see also: Uranium Mining in Eastern Germany: The WISMUT Legacy (38k)\n\n(see also Decommissioning Data)\n\n> See also: National Reports for Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (IAEA)\n\n'Much remains to be done' - review of 30 years of reclamation of Wismut's uranium mining legacy concludes\n\nThe local NGO \"Kirchlicher Umweltkreis Ronneburg\" who has been following the issue since the last years of the former GDR, has published a review of 30 years of reclamation works in the former uranium mining areas of Saxony and Thuringia, Germany.\n\n> Download: 30 Years of Remediation of Uranium Mining in Saxony and Thuringia, Germany, by Frank Lange, Translation of Supplement in Ronneburger Strahlentelex No. 2, Oct. 31, 2021 (777kB PDF - in English)\n\nOriginal version: 30 Jahre Sanierung Uranbergbau in Sachsen und Thüringen, Sonderbeilage in Ronneburger Strahlentelex No. 2 , 31.

This residue is sold to Nuclear Fuels Corporation since 1997.\n\nThe total amount of uranium recovered during Wismut's decommissioning phase between 1990 and 2021 was 3,350 t U.\n\nWhile the water treatment will have to continue for years to come, the uranium will no longer be extracted from the residues from now on.\n\n(Wismut June 1, 2021)\n\nGovernment approves Wismut's reclamation plan for the next 30 years - at costs of EUR 2.1 billion\n\nThe German Federal Ministry of Economics has approved Wismut's reclamation plan for the years from 2020 to 2050. The reclamation of the Helmsdorf tailings dam is to be completed by 2022, that of the Königstein and Schlema-Alberoda mines by 2025, and that of the Culmitzsch tailings dam by 2028. After that, treatment of contaminated water and effluents will still be required at Wismut's former sites for decades to come.\n\nThe plan requires another EUR 2.1 billion in addition to the EUR 6.8 billion spent so far already.

After this date, long-term tasks such as water treatment, environmental monitoring and surveillance of reclaimed surfaces will have to continue for an unknown period of time. (DAPD June 23, 2011)\n\nFederal cleanup of Wismut's uranium mining legacy to cost more and last longer\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, sole owner of Wismut GmbH, has increased the initial Euro 6.65 billion cleanup budget by 5.3% to Euro 7 billion. Of this total amount, Euro 5.4 billion have been spent until end 2010 already. The amount available for the year 2011 is Euro 139 million.\n\nThe completion of the reclamation work, initially set at 2010/2012, is now expected 10 years later at 2020/2022. The completion of the most challenging task, the stabilization of the largest uranium mill tailings deposit Culmitzsch is expected for 2022. The water treatment facilities for the effluents arising at various sites will have to continue operation even beyond that date, as heavy metal concentrations will still be too high for unrestricted release.

The funding requirements won't increase, though. Euro 5.1 billion have been spent until end 2008, while the total cost was initially estimated at Euro 6.6 billion. (Freie Presse Jan. 2, 2009)\n\nWismut's cleanup funds assured in 2004\n\nIn an answer to a parliamentary question, the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour has stated that Wismut GmbH will receive Euro 215 million for its regular reclamation work during the course of the year 2004. According to the current schedule, the clean-up will be completed in 2015. (Bundestags-Drucksache 15/2791 vom 26.3. 2004)\n\nNo major damages by floods at Wismut sites\n\nThe heavy rain events and floods in Eastern Germany have caused minor damages only to the Wismut uranium mine sites undergoing reclamation. The Saxonian mine sites of Schlema/Alberoda and Königstein were those most affected, while the Thuringian sites of Ronneburg (mine) and Seelingstädt (mill/tailings) were not affected. (Wismut Aug. 20, 2002)\n\nThe situation at the sites that are no longer under the jurisdiction of Wismut, including a number of uranium mill tailings ponds, is unclear, however.\n\nSaxony\n\nHelmsdorf tailings (Saxony), aerial view: Google Maps\n\nKönigstein underground/in-situ leach mine with Schüsselgrund waste pile (Saxony), aerial view: Google Maps\n\nReclamation of Helmsdorf uranium mill tailings pile completed\n\nOn December 15, 2023, Wismut employees installed the last cubic meters of material for the final cover at the Helmsdorf tailings pile . With this symbolic act, the company has completed the reclamation of the largest uranium mill tailings site in Saxony. At the Helmsdorf site, 50 million cubic meters of radioactive residues (tailings) from uranium ore processing are stored on an area of around 200 hectares. The costs of the renovation totaled 300 million euros.\n\nA complex drainage system collects seepage water around the facility and will continue to purify it in the new Helmsdorf water treatment plant. Over time, the amount of seepage water will decline due to the covering systems applied; however, it will never completely dry up. In the long term, it is assumed that the amount of seepage water will be 30,000 liters per hour, which will continue to accumulate and be collected and cleaned over many decades. The quality of these waters will not allow them to be released directly into bodies of water until further notice.

In addition, Wismut GmbH and the state dam administration have implemented extensive flood protection measures, including relocating dikes. The area directly next to the Zwickauer Mulde river was converted into green space by October 2021. The result is a floodplain landscape that serves as a retention area in the event of a flood.\n\nThe total costs of around 120 million euros were divided into 27 million euros for demolition work, 57 million euros for the removal of the Crossen heap and 36 million euros for area renovation measures.

(Wismut Sep. 19, 2018)\n\nNow, soil cover of Wismut's waste rock pile No. 66/207 starts slumping down\n\nDuring an inspection in early January 2018, a slump of the cover of the waste rock pile No. 66/207 in Bad Schlema was discovered. A crack with a length of approx. 20 metres had formed in the top cover of the pile, and the cover had moved about 1 metre downhill.\n\nThe pile covering an area of 31 hectares had been reclaimed between 1994 and 2017. (Wismut Jan. 19, 2018)\n\nThe repair works on the damaged cover of the waste rock pile No. 66/207 in Bad Schlema have been completed. The damaged cover was removed and new cover material was installed and compacted. The cause of the slump was attributed to water saturation of the cover after heavy rain and thaw of snow in connection with very fine-grained cover material. (Wismut Nov. 13, 2019)\n\nMystery of slumping soil cover of Wismut's waste rock pile No. 366 solved (?)\n\nOther than previously thought, it wasn't the mice who caused recurring slumps of the cover of Wismut's waste rock pile No. 366 near Aue, Saxony. After a thorough investigation, Wismut now believes that the silt contents of the cover material was too high, causing the soil cover to creep. Wismut now has replaced the cover material in question and strengthened the requirements for the silt contents of cover material.

Flooding of the deepest sections of the up to 1800 metres deep mine started already in 1991. The water level is allowed to rise at a slow pace to avoid subsidence at the surface. After completion of the flooding, contaminated discharges from the mine will have to be treated in the long term at a rate of 800 cubic metres per hour. (Freie Presse July 2, 2009)\n\nWater treatment plant under construction at Wismut's Hartenstein waste rock pile\n\nAn effluent treatment plant is under construction for seepage catched at Wismut's No. 371 waste rock pile at Hartenstein in the Aue area. While seepage at other waste rock piles is allowed to flow into former underground mines located beneath the piles, there exist no such mines at this site: therefore, seepage could reach the Zwickauer Mulde river, if untreated. The No. 371 pile covers an area of more than 65 hectares. The average amount of seepage collected is 37 cubic metres per hour, while the plant can handle 100 cubic metres per hour.\n\nExcess mine water from the former underground mines in the Aue area arises at a rate of 750 cubic metres per hour and is treated by a treatment plant with a capacity of 1150 cubic metres per hour.

In the future, the water level will be stabilized at this value by pumping out any excess amounts of groundwater flowing in.\n\nThe collection takes place via an underground water collection system and a well located in the Gessental valley and directly connected to the mine cavity. The water level is thus kept as far as possible at a largely uniform level. Impairments of the environment through uncontrolled leaks of groundwater are thus avoided.\n\nIn recent years, the technical equipment for the collection, transport and treatment of the amounts of groundwater arising had to be extended. Wismut GmbH thus responded to groundwater quantities that were well above the original expectations. After the expansion of the Ronneburg water treatment plant (until 2011), the flooding water level was lowered intermediately.

The group raises concerns related to the flooding of the former underground mines, and related to the top cover to be applied to the Lichtenberg waste rock pile.\n\nThe Thuringian underground mines with approx. one thousand kilometers of tunnels are currently in the process of being refilled with groundwater. During the active mining period, groundwater had been pumped, producing a huge depression cone. Now, the pumps have been shut off, allowing inflowing groundwater to refill the mine. According to the group, the procedure chosen for the refilling of the mines allows for higher contaminant levels in any outcropping water than achievable with a more modest refilling scheme that would require more expenses for water treatment, though.\n\nThe former Lichtenberg open pit is being refilled with contaminated waste rock material. Eventually, the waste material will form a new pile at the site of the former open pit. It is planned to cover this pile with 1 metre of slightly contaminated material, plus a 40 cm top cover of neutral material. The group criticizes that this cover design allows for twice the infiltration rates from rainfall than achievable with a better cover design that would be more expensive, though; in addition, it were not clear whether the design chosen would be suitable to sustain trees and whether it would meet the 200 year durability criterion aimed at by Wismut.

These may have altered the situation concerning radiation exposure significantly. Especially waste rock dumps from old mining activities as well as 20th century uranium mining may, due to their radon exhalation capacity, lead to significant radiation exposures. They often lie close to or within residential areas. To investigate the impact on the natural radon level, the federal office for radiation protection has run networks of radon measurement points in 16 former mining areas, together with 2 networks in regions not influenced by mining for comparison purposes. Altogether, data has been taken at 595 measurement points.\n\nAs a result of these investigations, representative overviews of the long-term outdoor radon concentrations could be established including estimates of regional background concentrations. One of the most important findings of the investigations is the fact that the former mining and milling activities did not result in large area impacts on the outdoor radon level. Only some of the neighbourhoods immediately adjacent to mining residues show a significant increase of concentration, which might also influence the indoor concentrations in nearby houses.\n\nBased on the background values, regions were identified where the radon exhalation from mining residues has lead to increased concentrations in residential areas and resulting radiation exposures of the population estimated. Also, the consequences of the Wismut companies reclamation activities are reported. Finally, recommendations are given on the radiological evaluation of outdoor radon concentrations.\"\n\n> Download: Ergebnisse der Radonmessungen in der bodennahen Luft der Bergbaugebiete , BfS-SW-05/09, C.
