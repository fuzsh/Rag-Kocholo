EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT CONDITION OF EUROPEAN GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY; WITH SEPARATE DESOEIPTIOKS AND STATISTICS OF EACH STATE, AND A COI'IOUS INDEX, FAOILITATINa REFERENCE TO EVERT ESSENTIAL FACT IN THE HISTORY AND PRESENT STATE OF EUROPE. BY FRAXCIS H. UXGEWITTER, LLD. NEW YOEK: A. S. BARNES & CO., 51 JOHN-STREET. CINCINNATI: â€” n. W. DERBY. 1854. Enteeed, according to Act of Congress, In the year 1 854, by A, 8. BARNES & CO. In the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New-York, PREFACE. As author of several extensive geographical works, which have been successfully published in Germany, my native country, I have ventured to prepare this vol- ume with the view of offering to the American public a guide in European Geography and History. It is superfluous to say that the value of such a work depends entirely upon its authenticity and accuracy : and that these qualities are, especially in Germany, es- sential to success. In endeavoring to avoid all superficial and unfounded statements, I have hoped also to steer clear of pedantry and prolixity. For such a volume, in the present state of popular information, I should not have felt justified in using any other than original and authentic materials. Fortunately, materials of this land are not at all lack- ing in Europe. First, in most European countries an official almanac is published every year, which contains more or less copious statistical particulars to be relied PREFACE. on. Secondly, a census is taken in certain periods, not restricted to the population only, but extended to a great variety of other statistical matters. Thirdly, there is scarcely a European state without its special g-eog-raphi- cal and historical description, written by a native scholar. Beside these abundant materials, the official parliamen- tary reports and documents in many states furnish au- thentic statements with regard to the public finances, the army, the na\\y, etc. Moreover, I have visited most of the European countries, and have thus been enabled to fill up deficiencies almost inevitable with him who knows a people or a country merely by books. The index, annexed to this volume, and containing nearly ten thousand names, will enable the reader to find readily any essential fact connected with European geog- raphy or history. The table of contents, prefixed to the volume, gives at once a clear view of all those fifty-six states, which constitute Europe in a political sense. The arrangement with reference to the mountain ranges, rivers, lakes, etc., of all Europe, by compressing them within the compass of one common description, will perhaps meet with the approbation of the reader ; tedi- ous repetitions being avoided in this way. Beside this, llio introduction contains a general, yet condensed history of I'iUrnpc. Concerning the description of each of these fifty-six European states, the order observed is thus: first, the statements about area and population, surface, soil, PREFACE. natural products, manufactures, commerce and trade, public finances, form of government, strength of the army and (with maritime states) of the navy, and the orders of honor ; secondly, the history ; and thirdly, the topography of the state. Trusting that the public will kindly make allowance \"^ for my want of an elegant English style, the more so as until the last year I never had any suitable oppor- tunity to improve in it practically, I sincerely wish, that for the rest this volume may answer every reasonable expectation on the part of the reader.

Area of Eueope : 3,816,936 square miles. Population of Eueope : 262,800,000 inhabitants. 1. Before entering upon the subject, it may be remarked that most of the statistical statements in this work, especially those concerning the population of states, cities, towns, etc., correspond with the official and other authentic reports from the beginning of the year 1848. The political revolutions which since have occurred in most of the European countries, have in many in- stances changed the state of things, caused numerous emigrations, and, at all events, prevented a careful investigation in statistical matters. Moreover, a census is in Europe nowhere taken annu- ally, but, for instance, in France every fifth, in Germany every third year, and so on. However, the statements in this work being thoroughly authentic, they will afford a sure stand-point with regard to all future events, until matters and things are completely settled again in Europe. 2. The above-stated area of 3,816,936 square miles, is distrib- uted as follows : â€” Germany, 244,375 square miles. The Prussian provinces of Prussia and Posen, 36,508 \" \" Hungary, Galicia, etc., . . . 164,521 \" \" EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Area and Populalion of each country. Italy, . Switzerland, .

Density of ropulation â€” Boundariesâ€” Climate. This makes a population of about 70 inhabitants to a square mile â€” the highest ratio in any division of the world. For Asia (including the Indian Archipelago) has only 32, Africa has 13, America (i. e., North and South America) has but 3, and Aus- tralasia and Polynesia have no more than 1 inhabitant on a square mile. If the United States, whose extent (including Texas, but excluding California) is estimated at 2,620,000 square miles, and where, upon an average^ at present only 9 souls live on a square mile, were as thickly settled as Europe, they would have a population of 183,400,000 inhabitants; and not less than 801,720,000, if the proportion were like that of Holland and Belgium, where the population is 306 to a square mile. 4. The most northerly point of the European continent is North Cape (which belongs to Norway), N. lat. 71Â° 11' ; and its most southerly point is Gibraltar^ N. lat. 36Â° 7'. Thus these parallels correspond with those of the northern part of Hudson's Bay, and of Ilillsboro, or Louisburg, in North Carolina. The distance between North Cape and Gibraltar, is 2,424 miles. The most easterly point of Europe is Caihariyiburg (at the frontier of European Russia and Siberia), long. 60^ 40' E. from Greenwich ; and its most westerly point is Cape Roxa?it (belonging to Portu- gal), long. 9Â° 31' W. from Greenwich; and the distance between these two extreme points, is 3,370 miles. '5. Europe is bounded on the north by the Arctic, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. On the east the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles, and the Archi- pelago, form the boundaries towards Asia : and on the south, Europe is separated from Asia by the Black Sea, and from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea. 6. The climate is generally much warmer than in the same parallels in America and Asia, and the difference is equivalent to eight or ten degrees of latitude. This may be accounted for by EUROPE, PAST AXD PRESENT. 8urfÂ»ce.â€” Mountains : Alpsâ€” PyreneeB. the almost universal cultivation of the soil in Europe, and by the absence of those extensive forests, which are to be found in America and Siberia. 7. In the north (with the exception of European Russia) and in the south, the surface is generally mountainous ; but in the middle parts of Europe, plains, here and there intersected by ranges of low mountains and hills, are prevailing. From the mouths of the Rhine, an immense plain runs through Holland, the north of Germany, the provinces of West and East Prussia, Poland, and Russia, to the Ural Mountains ; and its highest elevation, near the sources of the Volga, Dnieper, and Don, is 1,064 feet. Other plains of smaller extent are to be found in Hungary, Wallachia, Lombardy, France. &c. The mountainous regions of the Euro- pean continent, occupy together an area of about 979,800 square miles. The most remarkable mountain ranges of Europe are the following : â€” a. The Alps, the principal chain of mountains in Europe, occupying an area of nearly 74,550 square miles, run from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, at the boundary between France and Italy, through Savoy, Switzerland, Tyrol, and other provinces of Austria, to the western parts of Tiu\"key, at a distance of about 550 miles. Several regions of them have particular names, as, Maritime Alps (nearest to the coast), Cottian Alps (with the Pelvoux de Yallouise), Gray Alps (between Savoy and Piedmont), Pennine Alps (with the Mont Blanc), Lrpontine Alps (with the Mount Rosa), etc. The highest peaks of the Alps, are: the Mont Blanc (in Savoy, 15,668 feet high), M<mnt Rosa (in Savoy, but near the frontier of Switzerland, 15,527 f), Finsteraar- horn (in Switzerland, 14,325 f), Pelvoux de Vallouise (on the French territory, 14,044 f), Junrjfrau (or Virgin, 13,730 f), Schreckhorn (13,310 fâ€” the two latter in Switzerland), Ortles (in Tyrol, 13,065 f), Watzmann (m Bavaria, 9,150 f.), and Terglou (in Carintliia, 10,194 f. high). b. The Pykenees separate France from Spain, running in an almost westerly direction from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, to that of the Bay of Bi-cay. The higliest peaks f)f this mountain range, are: the Maladrtta (11,430 f), Mont Perdu (10,482 Â£), and Pico Las Posets (10,584 f.) on the Spanish side, GENERAL VIEW OF EUROPE. Mountains : Sierra Nevada â€” Appenines â€” Carpathians, etc. and the Marbore (10,374 f.), Vignemale (10,350 f.), Piclong (9,972 f.), and Canigou (8,800 f.) on the French side. c. The SiEERA Nevada, the principal mountain range of Spain, covers chiefly that part of tlie country commonly called Upper Andalusia, or the province of Granada. Its highest peaks are the Cumbre de Mulhaccn (11,678 f), and Picacho de Velcta (11,200 f). One branch of the Sierra Nevada, running in the direction of Cadiz, and ending in Cape Trafalgar, is partly named Alpvr jarras, partly Sierra de Honda. Parallel with the Sierra Nevada, and in the direction of Algarve (the southern province of Portugal), nms the Sierra Morena, which, in Portugal, bears the name of Sierra Monchique. Other mountain ranges in Spain, are the Cantabrian and Iberian Mountains, the Sierra de Cuenca, Sierra de Gnadarama, and Sierra de Ouadalupe. d. The Apennines skirt the Gulf of Genoa, and nm south-east to the south extremity of Italy. They b^r particidar names, according to tlieir local position. Ligurian Apenni^^ (witli (he ifonte Cimone, in the Duchy of Modena, 6,778 feet high), Etruscan Apennines, Roman Apennines (with the Monte di Sibylla, 7,038 f.), Neapolitan Apennines, and Abruzzi (in the northern part of the kingdom of Naples, with the Gran Sasso d' Italia, 9,577 thigh). The volcano Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, is 3,932 feet higL On the island of Sicily are, besides the volcano Mount Etna or Monte Gibello (10,870 Â£ high), to be noted the Callata bellata (3,699 f), Cuceio (3,329 Â£), and Scudenj (3,190 f); on the island of Sardinia, the Gennargcntu (5,630 f), and Gigantinu (3,744 f ) ; and on the island of Corsica, the Monte Rotondo (8,500 f), Pagalia Orba (8,100 I), and Omto (7,900 Â£). e. The Carpathes, forming the boundary between Hungary and Galicia, run in a south-easterly direction from the sources of the Oder River to the Danube. The western part bears the particular name of the Beskides, the middle part that of the Carpathes Proper or Tatra Mountains, awA the south- east part, comprising Transylvania, Upper Hungary, and tlie north of \"Walla- chia, is called the Highland Erdely. The highest peaks of the Carpathian Mountains are, the Ruska Poyana (9,912 Â£), Gailuripi (9,000 Â£), Lomnitzer Spitze (Peak of Lomnitz, 8,316 Â£), and Krivan (7,818 Â£). Tlie highest peak of the Beskides in particular, is the Babia Gura, which rises to 5,420 feet /. The Scandinavian Mountains form, for a great part, the boundary be- tween Sweden and Noi-way, where they are called Kolen (hterally, the Keel). Near Roeraas, in Norway, the chief branch of the range, running south-west, assumes the name of Dovre-fjeld (fjeld has the signification of Alpine range), EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT.

Other peaks of the Skaiuhnaviiui Mountains, arc the Snoelicctta (8,122 f.), a.ml Sulitolma (6,o40 f.). g. The Balk.\\n or Haeinus, running east through the midst of Turkey, rises to the hfight of no more than 3,000 feet, and is tlioroughly covered with extensive forests. Among its five passes, those of Schumla are renowned in military history. Another mountsiin range in Turkey, and partly in Greece, is the Pindus, rising to the height of more than 5,000 faet, and some of its divisions are cidled the Bora, Mezzovo, and Ar/rapha Mountams, h. In France are, besides the Pyrenees, to be noted : the Jura Mou>fTAiNS, forming the boundary between France and Switzerland (with the Reculet, 6,280 f , and Grand Colombier, 5,220 f., on the French side ; and with the Dolf,5,Wt L,Mont Tendre, 5,170 f, Chasseron, 4,976 f., Creux du Vent, 4,512 f , and Tcte de Rang, 4,384 f., on the side of Switzerland) ; the Sevennes, commencing near the east end of the Pyrencc^^nd running north, form ^he dividing ridge between the valleys of the ifline and Loire (then- highest eummits are, the Mezin of 6,162 f, Lozere of 5,584 f., Tarare of 4,350 f., and Pilat of 8,696 f in height) ; the Mountains of Auvergne, branching from the Sevcnnes and running north-west, form the dividing ridge between the valleys of the Loire and the Garonne ; their principal part is known by the name of Mont Dore, and their highest peaks, commonly called Puy, are : Pwj de Sancy (5,838 f ), Pny de Dome (4,548 f ), and Plomh de Cantal (5,718 f ) ; the Vosges, running parallel with the Rhine, separate the provinces of Lorraine and Alsace, and rise to 4,400, 4,300, 3,900, and 3,100 feet, in the Ballon de 8uh, Tete d^ Ours, Ballon d' Alsace, and. Grand Donnon (branches at the north end of the Vosges, bear the names of Monts de Fancille and JIardt Mounta'nis, the latter with the Mont de Tonnere, 2,035 f. high) ; the Cote d'Or (in the prov- ince of Burgundy), and Morwan Mountains (on the high road between Paris and Lyoas), rise to 1,842 and 2,000 feet; lastly, the Ardennes, running from the northern parts of Champagne to Luxemburg, are woody hills rising to 1,800 feet, and part of them are called the Argonncs. i. The highest mountain range in the north of Germany, are the Sudetes, or Sud/lic Mountains, along the southern frontier of Silesia, with diiferent divisions and names. The Sudetic Mountains proper form the boundary between Austrian Silesia and Moravia (with the Altvater 4,640 f., and the Oreat Schneeberg or Snow-peak, 4,400 f high). Tlie Riesengehirge, or Giants' Mountains, form the boundary between Silesia and Bohemia, (with the Ricscn, or Schncekoppe, 5,056 f., the Great Sturmhaube, 4,540 f, lA'ile Stunnhaub* GENERAL VIEW OF EUROPE.

Other divisions of the Sudetes are : the Moravian Mountains, (between Moravia and Bohemia), the Ilahchchwerdt Mountains (in Silesia), the Eulcn-Gebirge, or Owl Mountains, (with the Hohc Eule, 3,082 f., in Silesia), and Heuscheuer Gcbirge, or Haybarn Mountains (partly in Silesia, partly in Bohemia). Between Breslau and the Eulen-Gebirjje, rises the Zobtenbcrg to 2,280 feet. j.

The Ural and Caucasus Mountains belong to Asiatic Russia. 8. The Northern and Atlantic Oceans, by which Europe is boundod on the north and west, penetrate in many parts of the continent, thus forming a great number of peninsulas, bays, and inland aeas. The most remarkable of the latter, formed by the GENERAL VIEW OF EUROPE. Inland Seas, Bays, Sounds, Straits. Arctic Ocea7i, is the White Sea, which penetrates the northern coast of Russia to the extent of 276 miles. The principal inland seas, bays, etc., formed by the Atlantic Ocean, are the following : â€” The North Sea, which separates the British Islands from the European continent, and has an extent nearly equal to that of Germany. A branch of the North Sea, called Skagerack, and 69 miles wide, separates the Danish plliinsula of Jutland from Norway; the then following Caticgat (about 140 miles long and 70 wide), separates Jutland from Sweden ; and the following three channels, or straits, lead from the Cattegat into the Baltic Sea, viz. : the Ocrcsound, commonly called Sound (between Zealand and Sweden), the Great Belt (between Funen and Zealand), and the Little Belt (between Sleswick and Funen). The Baltic Sea, with an extent of 135,680 square miles, and surrounded by Sweden, Russian, Prussian, German, and Danish countries, is, between Ystad and the island of Rugen, only 53 miles wide. Two gulfs set up from the Baltic : the Gulf of Bothnia^ between Sweden and Finland, and the Gulf of Finland, between Finland and Esthland. Inferior to them in extent is the Gulf of Riga, before the mouth of the Duna River. Between Tilsit and Memel is the Curische Haff, or Sea, almost entirely enclosed by a long and small tongue of land, with a narrow pass- age into the Baltic. Other seas of the same kind, are the Fresh Haff, before the mouths of the Pregel and other rivers, and the Great and Little Haff, before the mouth of the Oder. A great inland sea, or bay, in the north of Holland, is the Zuyder Zee, 90 miles long, and 45 miles wide. Far inferior to it in extent is the Dollart, before the mouth of Ems River. The Strait of Dover, separating England from France, is about 27 miles wide ; and the well-known English Channel, is, upon an average, 70 miles wide. 1* 10 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT.

The Mediterranean Sea, separating Europe from Africa, and on the east bordered by Asia, has an extent of 1,01 1,750 square miles, and is 2,415 long, while its breadth is very different. Before the mouth of the Rhone, is the Gulf of Lyons, and before the city of Genoa, the Gulf of Genoa. The Strait of Bonifacio separates the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, and the Strait of Messina separates the island of Sicily from continental Italy. At the south-east extremity of Italy, is the Gulf of Taranto ; farther to the east, the Strait of Otranto separates Italy from Turkey, and connects the Ionian Sea (between the Ionian Islands and Sicily) with the Adriatic Sea, which latter separates Italy from Dalmatia, and whose extent is estimated at nearly 63.900 square miles. The Grecian Archipelago separates Greece and European Turkey from Asia Minor, and is connected by the Dardanelles Strait, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus Strait., with the Black Sea, the extent of which is computed at 182.115 square miles. The Strait of Jenikale connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Aznf before the mouth of the Don. 9. The most remarkable lakes are in the north of Europe, and in the region of the Alps. In Russia are to be noted : Lake Ladoga, east of the Gulf of Finland, and in the neiglilxjrhood of St. Petersburg; its extent, computed at 0,220 square miles, exceeds that of the kingiom of Saxony , Lake Onega, east of the former, GENERAL VIEW OF EUROPE. 11 Lakes. with an extent of 4,260 square miles ; Lake llmen, 28 miles long and 20 wide, in the prorince of Novogorod ; Lake Saima, about 40 miles long and wide, in Finland.

As for minerals, no other division of the \\vorld has so many iron, lead, copper, tin, quicksilver, salt, and coal mines ; whereas, pre- cious metals are more abundant in America, Asia, and Africa. The Russian gold and silver mines, are situated in Asia. Hun- gary and Transylvania have the richest gold mines in Europe. Silver is chiefly found in the Carpathic, Ore, Hartz, and Scandi- navian Mountains ; copper, in Sweden, Norway, Russia, Hungary, and England ; iron, in Sweden, Russia, Austria, France, Prussia, England, and Belgium ; ti/i, in England. Lead is very generally diffused in Europe ; but quicksilver is obtained exclusively from tbe mines of Almaden, in Spain ; of Idria, in Austria ; and of Wolfstein, in the Palatinate of Bavaria. The most noted coal mines are near Newcastle, in England ; yet this mineral is also found, in almost inexhaustible quantities, in France, Belgium, and Germany. Galicia, Hungary, and Transylvania, abound in root salt ; and the salt mines of Wieliezka, in Galicia, are the most noted in the world. Nowhere are found so many mineral springs as in Europe. The staple agricultural products of Europe, are wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Maize is cultivated in the south of 18 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Natural Produclionsâ€” Animals â€” Races of Men. Europe, and rice only in Lombardy, and Turkey. The potato is very common in Europe ; and the highest degree of latitude, where it thrives, is the 60th. In the cultivation of the vine (from 48Â° and 49Â° of latitude down to the southern extremity of Europe), olive (chiefly in France and Italy), and chestnut, Europe excels ; and this division of the world is, at the same time, the only one where the forests are regularly managed. With regard to animals, horses (the finest breed in England and Germany), callle (the finest in Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain, and Holland), sheep (of various breeds, but the finest in Germany, Spain, and England), hogs, and other valuable domestic animals are found in great perfection throughout Europe, nearly to the parallel of 60Â°. Mules are reared in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and in the south of France. The ferocious and other wild animals of Europe, are generallly less in number than those of some of the other quarters of the earth. The wolf and bear are still found in Russia, Sweden, and in the mountainous regions of France ; elks, in some parts of Sweden, Russia, and East Prussia ; the wild ox (in ancient times, very common in Germany) is still pre- served in the forest of Bialowicza, in Lithuania. The largest bird of Europe, is the great bustard {olis tarda.) Silkworms are most abundant in Italy. 12. Nearly all the Europeans belong to the Caucasian race. Only a few tribes in Russia are Mongolians. With respect to their origin, the Europeans form three great divisions : the Germames, Slavonians, and Romanians, {a.) The Germanes are to be con- sidered as descendants of Gomer (Gen. x. 2), or of the Kimres, who at first lived in the countries near the mouths of the Dnieper lind Dniester, whence they afterwards moved to the north and northwest, and peopled the Scandinavian peninsula, the present kingdom of Denmark, Germany, etc. The old Goths were like- wise Germanes. Thus, to the great family or tribe of the Ger- GENERAL VIEW OF EUROPE. 19 Races of Menâ€” Religion. manes belong the Germans proper, most of the Swiss, and part of the English, the Dutch, the Flemings (in Belgium), the Danes, Icelanders, Nonoegians, and Swedes, {b.) The Slavonians (or rather Slaves, but in another sense than those who are in bondage), in ancient times called Sannates, are probably descendants of Magog and Madai. (Gen. x. 2), or of the Scythians and Medes. In the beginning they lived in the country between the Don, Volga, and the Caucasus Mountains, and in the course of time spread over the present Russia and Poland, and westward to the Elbe River. To the great family or tribe of the Slavonians, belong the Russians, Poles, Servians, Bosniacs, Bulgarians, Croats, Slavonians proper, Bohemians, etc. (c) The Romanians are de- scendants, partly of the ancient Iberians, Gauls, etc., partly of the ancient Romans and Greeks, and partly of the Germanes ; and the Italians, French, Spaniards, Portuguese, and part of the Swiss, belong to this great family, or tribe. Besides these three great divisions, there are still found descendants of the ancient Celts, or Gaels, in Ireland and Wales, and the highlands of Scotland ; and Basques, or descendants of the Iberians, in Biscay, and the neighborhood of Bayonne, in France. The Turks belong to the Tartar tribe ; the Magyars, in Hungary, are probably descend- ants of the ancient Scythians, and lived, until the close of the ninth century of' the Christian era, in the vicinity of the Ural River ; and the Greeks are descendants partly of the ancient Greeks, but chiefly of Slavonian tribes. The descent of the Jews is universally known. 13. With the exception of about 7,000.000 Mohammedans, 3.000,000 Jcips, and a few Pagans among the Samojedes and Kaluiucs, all the Europeans are Christians. Of these, nearly 133.000.000 are i?o/Â«rt^?i Catholics (occupying the Pyrenean pe- ninsula and Italy, and prevailing in France, Ireland, Belgium, Poland, Austria, and Bavaria), more than 59,000,000 are attached 90 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Civilizationâ€” Science and Arts. to the Greek Church (chiefly in Kussia, and moreover prevailing in Turkey, Greece, and the Ionian Islands), and about 58,000,000 are I'rotcstants (almost exclusively occupying the Scandinavian peninsula and Denmark, and prevailing in Great Britain, Prussia, Holland, Finland, in the Baltic provinces of Russia, and in most of the German states). 14. All Europeans are civilized^ except the Laplanders, Samo jedes, some Kalmuc tribes, and the Gipsies (the latter chiefly in Hungary, Russia, Spain, and England), who are to be regarded as half-civilized ; and as civilization has prevailed among them for many hundred years, Europe is not only the most enlightened, but also the best cultivated grand division of the earth. By its emi- grants, America, and civilized countries of other parts of the world, have been peopled. Husbandry is at the highest pitch of improvement in England, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzer- land, and Lombardy. In manufactures and commerce, Great Britain excels all other empires ; but in the former, or at least in many branches of manufactures, France, Belgium, and Ger- many rival it. The states of Europe, next after Great Britain in commercial importance, are : France, Russia, Germany, Austria, Holland, etc. The improvement of all the sciences, and the finest productions of genius, belong exclusively to the Europeans. In almost all European countries, numerous universities, colleges, and other schools, provide for every branch of learning ; and, on â€¢ the other hand, the fine arts have their chief scat in Europe. All the great painters, sculptors, artists in music, architects, and poets of ancient and modern times, were Europeans.* There are to be found, it is true, huge monuments of ancient architecture in Africa, Asia, and America, but compared with the sublime * These remarks are intended to include the descendants of Europeans in the United States and elsewhere.

Most of the European countries are noted for their excellent roads (above all England), and only Turkey and Hungary are without them. Canals are most numerous in England, and, as for the European continent, in Russia, Holland, Belgium, France, and Sweden. Besides this, England is crossed in almost every direction by rail-roads, which are now also to be found in every country of the continent. 15. Europe comprises 55 independent states, of which 33 belong to Germany, (exclusive of Prussia and Austria, the grand-duchy of Luxemburg, and the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg), 7 to Italy, and 2 to the Netherlands (Belgium and Holland being called thus in a general signification). If we mai-k Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands with the name of countries, we may say that Europe comprises 16 countries, of which 14 are at the same time states, or political bodies. These IG Eui'opean countries are the following: â€” 1, Russia; 2, Sweden and Norway ; 3, Denmark ; 4, Great Britain and Ire- land ; 5, Portugal ; 6, Spain ; 7, France ; 8, the Netherlands ; 0, Germany ; 10, the kingdom of Prussia ; 11, the Austrian em- pire ; 12, Switzerland; 13, Italy; 14, the Ionian Islands; 15, Turkey; and IG, Greece. Of those 55 states, 8 have a republican, and the remaining 47 a monarchic form of government. The 7 republics are : France, San Marino, the Helvetic and the Ionian Republics, and the free German cities, Hamburg, Bre- men, Lubec, and Frankfort. Among the 47 monarchic states are â€” 3 Empires: Austria, Russia, and Turkey (for the Grand Sig- uier is in some respect considered as successor of the ancient 22 EUROPE, PAST AND PRE3EM.

The oldest republic in Europe is San Marino, (from 4G9 A. D.); the oldest empire is the Turkish (from 1453; the Russian dates from 1721, and the Austrian from 1804); the oldest kingdoms are Spain, Denmark, and England ; the oldest grand duchy is Tuscany, and the oldest duchy is Brunswick. Russia comprises the most extensive territory, the principality of Liechtenstein is the smallest state in population, and San Ma- rino the smallest in extent among the European states. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF EUROPE. The history of Europe can, as a general historical sketch of all the European states, of course, not go farther back than to the time of the migration of nations^ or to that of the dissolu- tion of the wesier7i Roman empire ; because until that time most of the European countries were constituent parts of the Roman empire, while the rest were then still in a too barbarous stage of society to form a proper subject of political history. We will only add, that at the time of the Christian era, the Roman em- pire comprised the whole south of Europe, all France, England, the greatest part of the Netherlands, Switzerland and the south of Germany, Hungary, Turkey, and Greece, beside many other nations and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. 1. In the fourth century after Christ, the Goths (see In trod. 4 12) occupied the north-east of Europe, the Visigoths were settled in Dacia (Moldavia and Wallachia) and west of the Dnieper : and the Ostrogoths east of the Dnieper river. The Goths were the first among all the Germanic tribes, who adopted Christianity. Retwcen the Volga and Don rivers lived the Alans. 2. Meanwhile the Huns, whose primitive seat was near the northern boundary of China, had moved onward to the west : in 375, they attacked and pressed forward the Alans, and then both nations pressed on the Goths. In this way commenced the great 24 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. The Alansâ€” Vundalsâ€”BurgunUiansâ€” Saxons. migration of nations into the several parts of the Roman empire. In 378 the Visigoths, conjointly with the Huns and Alans, in- vaded Thracia, and defeated the Roman emperor Valens at Adrianople. Afterwards Alaric, king of the Visigoths, was in- vested with the government of Illyricum (Dalmatia and the southern provinces of Turkey), and in 403 he invaded Italy, threatened Rome twice with destruction, and in the year 410 he took the city and gave it up to plunder. He shortly after died, and his successor, Athaulf, making peace with emperor Hono- rius, conducted his Visigoths to Gaul or France (in the year 412), and in 4 1 4 to Spain, where the Visigoths soon became the ruling nation, and founded an empire which comprised Aquitania (Guy- enne, Gascogne, and Languedoc, in France) also, and whose capi- tal was Toulouse. 3. About the same time, other Germanic tribes, the Alans, Vandals, Burgundians, and Sueves (ancestors of the Suabians in Wurtemberg), had moved on in the same direction, and, crossing the Rhine (in 406), settled themselves permanently in various parts of the Roman empire. The Vandals had their primitive seat in the north of Germany, between the Elbe and Vistula rivers, and in the first half of the 4th century transferred it to Pannonia (Bosnia and parts of Hungary). The Burgundians, at first residing in the vicinity of the Vandals, were compelled by the Gcp'uks (a Gothic tribe) to move from the mouth of the Vistula into Germany, and afterwards into Switzerland and the south-eastern provinces of the present France. The SuEVES had their primitive seat near the Elbe and in the middle parts of Germany, and many of them joined afterwards the Alans and Vandals on their march to the south-west of Europe. 4. In 420, the last Roman troops withdrew from Britannia, or England, which since was invaded and ravaged by the ancient Scots. The Britons, therefore, asked the assistance of two tribes SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 25 The Heraliâ€”(Odoacer)â€” Ostrogothsâ€” (TheoUoric)â€” Franks. of people from Germany, called Saxons (occupying the present kingdom of .Hanover and the duchy of Holstein) and Angles (in the pr(^ent duchy of Sleswick). These people readily com- plied with the request, and in 449 went over to Britain ; they drove back the Scots, but instead of then returning to Germany, they took possession of the country. Britain was afterwards divided by them into seven small kingdoms, called the Saxon He-piarchy. The Britons partly retired into \"Wales, partly emi- grated to Armorica (in France), which since received the name of Bretagne, or Brittany. 5. At the same time the Huns, now ruled by an enterprising king, Attila, re-appeared on the European theatre of war. At the head of 700,000 men, Attila marched from Hungary into Germany, ravaging and plundering everywhere, and then invaded Gaul, or France, which he was about to conquer likewise. But in a bloody battle at Chalons on the Marne, in 451. he was de- feated, whereupon he invaded Italy, and died (in 452). After his death the ties of his empire loosened, and the Huns them- selves dispersed by degrees among other nations. 6. In the year 47G, almost the last independent part of the Western empire, or Italy, with Home itself, was entirely subju- gated by Odoacer, the leader of another northern tribe, called the Ileruli ; and it remained under this dominion for 14 years. 7. Meanwhile the Ostrogoths (see ^ 1 of the History) had transferred their seat into Pannonia (Bosnia) and Thracia, and were on good terms with the rulers of the Eastern empire at Constantinople. Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, now made to emperor Zeno the offer of conquering Italy for him. His proposal being agreed to, Theodoric emigrated with all the Os- trogoths to Italy, defeated in 490 Odoacer in three battles, made himself master of the whole country, and was by emperor Anas- tasius, successor of Zeno, acknowledged as king of Itahj. But 2 26 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Merovingian Dynasty, Tounded by Clovis in Gaul. after his death, which occurred in 52G, emperor Justinian (who reigned from 527 to oijo), anxious to realize his claims on Italy, sent thither two eminent commanders, Belisarius and Narscs who, after a struggle of eighteen years, succeeded in their task, and made of Italy a province of the Eastern empire. The Eastern and Western empires were thus reunited, but only for a short period, as we soon shall see. 8. It is now time to cast a look at Gaul, or France. This latter name the country derived from the Thanks, a German tribe, who, between the third and fourth centuries, or in the period from 237 to 375, got possession of the northern part of Gaul. It is said, their first king here was Pharamond, who died in 428. His grandson Meroveus, who died in 458, was the founder of the dj'nasty of the Merovingians^ reigning in France for about three hundred years. But the most eminent of the Merovingians was Clovis, who drove the Eomans out of France (in 48G), subdued the Armoricans in Bretagne, subjected the Burgundians (see ^ 3) to tribute, wrested considerable tracts of land from the Visigoths in the south of France (see Â§ 2), and extended his compcsts northward to the Rhine. Clovis, having married a Christian princess, and attributing his success to the God whom she worshipped, determined to become a Christian himself, and in 49(3, he, with three thousand of his subjects, was baptized and anointed as king of .the Franks, at Rheims, by the bishop Remigius. After his death (which occurred in 511), France was divided among his four sons. This impolitic proceed- ing proved fatal to the common interest ; the more so, as it was followed by subsequent divisions. At last, after the death of king Charibcrt, of Paris, or since the year 5G9, France, or rather the Prankish empire, was divided into three distinct states, viz. : Austiasia, or the eastern empire (comprising the north-east of Gaul and the southern half of Germany, between Tyrol and the SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 8t The Mnjores-domus in France. â€” Carlovincrian Dynasty. forest of Thuriugia, aud between the Rhine and the Inn rivers); Neuslria^ or the western empire (comprising the north-west of Gaul, between the Waal and Loire rivers) ; and Burgundy, or the southern empire (comprising Provence, parts of Aquitania, parts of Switzerland and Alsace). The capital of Austrasia was Metz, that of Neustria Soissons, and that of Burgundy Orleans. In the beginning of the 7th century, the Frankish king used to invest eminent men with the superintendence of the domains and fiefs of the crown, and with the command of the royal military forces. These men, endowed with great power, were called Majores-domus ; one of them had the superintendence in Aus- trasia, another in Neustria, and a third in Burgundy. The last kings of the Merovingian dynasty being weaklings, and not much better than mock-kings, the Majores-domus came soon to be con- sidered as the actual rulers. In 687, Pepin of Iltrslall (the latter name was derived from his estate near Liege), Major-domus of Austrasia, was invested with the superintendence in the other Frankish kingdoms too, and from that time assumed the title of 'â€¢duke and prince of the Franks.\" He was succeeded in his dig- nity by his son Charles Martcll, renowned for his brilliant and decisive victory over the Moors or Arabs, between Tours and Poitiers, in 732. The son and successor of Charles Martell was Pepin the Little, who was indeed but a very small man, but had a mighty spirit in his little body, and moreover an enormous deal of strength. The weakness and inaptitude of the Merovingian kings having become now too obvious, the la.st of them, Childeric III., was, in 752, by an assembly of the states of the empire held at Soissons, declared to have forfeited his throne, and was exiled to a monastery ; while Pepin the Little was elected king of the Franks, and anointed by the bishop Bonifacius. \"With him began the sway of the dynasty of the Carlovingians (which 28 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT, The Lombardsâ€” Visigoths â€” Moors. name was derived from Pepin's son, Charles the Great, or Charle- magne). 9. The Greek emperors exercised their sway in Italy only for fourteen years. The Lombards (a Suevian or German tribe, at first having their seat near the middle course of the Elbe), who had once already been called on for assistance by the imperial governor Narses, returned to Italy in 568, headed by their val- iant king- Alboin, wrested the northern part, since called Lom- bardy, from the Greeks, and got possession of most of the other parts of the Italian peninsula. They even threatened Rome, but pope Stephen III., calling on the Frankish king, Pepin the Little, for help, the latter defeated the Lombards, and compelled them to cede to the holy seat the maritime country on the Adriatic Sea, which they lately had conquered. In this way the pope's temporal power was established, and the foundation laid of what is now called the States of the Church. This occurred in 755. In 774 new differences between the pope and the Lombards brought on tho intervention of Charlemagne, who vanquished the Lombards completely and embodied their kingdom with that of the Franks. Lower Italy (comprising the continental part of the present kingdom of Naples) and the Island of Sicily remained under the sway of the Greek emperors until 842, when this island and Calabria came into the possession of the Arabs. 10. The Visigoths had since their inroad in Spain (see Â§ 2) established their power there permanently, and extended it in the course of time over all parts of the peninsula. Their capital and royal residence was Toledo since 531. But as soon as the wars with other tribes and nations had ceased, there arose civil wars md other intestine commotions, which caused one party to call on the Moors or Arabs (who then had conquered the whole north- ern coast of Africa) for assistance. The latter acted the same part as the Saxons and Angles had done in Britain. Scarcely SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 29 Slaves â€” Croalea â€” Servians, etc. had they set their foot on the Spanish ground, in 711, when they attacked the Visigoths and defeated them completely in a battle at Xercs de la Frontera, which lasted nine days. The fate of Rod- eric, the last king of the Visigoths in Spain, was never known ; his horse and weapons were found near the field of battle, but his body was nowhere to be seen. Pelagio, a prince of the blood- royal, took command of the Goths who had not been slain by the Moors, led them into the mountainous region of Asturias, and founded there a little kingdom, the boundaries of which his suc- cessors enlarged in the course of time. But for the present, and for the next centuries, the Moors possessed the greatest part of the Pyrenean peninsula. 1 1 . During the migration of nations, many countries in the east of Europe were depopulated, and this circumstance gave oc- casion to the Slaves (see Introduction, ^ 12, i), to move farther to the west, and occupy the abandoned seats. The main body of the Slaves remained in Russia and Poland, but some tribes peopled Bohemia, others settled themselves in the German coun- tries bordering on the Baltic Sea ; while lower Hungary and Austria were occupied by the Avares (who had their primitive seat between the Black and Caspian Seas), Dalmatia, and other countries in the vicinity, by the Croates and Servians^ and Bul- garia by the Bulgarians (a Tartar tribe, who in the 5th century 'had emigrated from their primitive seat between the Volga and Ural rivers). x\\bout the Magyars^ see Introduction, ^12. 12. The European territory of i\\iQ Eastern empire, or of the Roman emperors residing at Constantinople, had, by all these circumstances, been greatly reduced ; nevertheless, it yet ranked highest among the Christian kingdoms by its civilization, wealth, and flourishing commerce. Constantinople was then the largest and handsomest city in Europe, and the imperial court displayed much splendor and luxury, though the history of this court pre- 80 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT.

The Scandinnvian countries, or Sweden, Norway, and Den- mark, were, if not first, 3'et chiefly peopled by the German tribe of GoTiis, who immigrated there about the Christian era. In the course of time those countries became, in a certain degree, overpopulated, which gave rise to the famous naval expeditions of the Normans, who after the 9th century invaded the shores of England, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France, every- where plundering and ravaging. They proved themselves to be as daring freebooters, as they were gallant warriors, and acted an important part in the political affairs of several European countries in the west and south. 14. Charlemagne (see ^ 8), who was born in 742, reigned from the year 768 to 814, and in this whole period he was almost continually at war. In 774 he wrested the kingdom of Italy from the Lombards (see Â§ 9), and added its crown to that which he wore already as king of the Franks. Meanwhile the long- nourished hostile sentiments between the Franks and their next neighbors in the north, the Saxons, had finally led to an erup- tion, which was followed by a war of more than thirty years. Charlemagne was indeed in this war the aggressor ; but beside his anxious desire to introduce Christianity among the pagan Saxons, he had well-founded political reasons to act as he did. For the Saxons had made frequent inroads into his empire, and moreover being a very valiant and enterprising people, it was to be feared they would sooner or later try to conquer it, or at least wrest some provinces from it. Thus the war commenced against them in 772, and lasted, though with some intervals, until P04, when a final treaty of peace was concluded, according to which tlie Saxons acknowledged the sovereignty of Charle- magne, and adopted the Christian faith. In one of those inter- SOCIAL AXD POLITICAL HISTORY. 31 Division of the Empire of Uliarlemagne â€” Germany. vals, in 778, the Moorish governor of Saragossa requested Charle- magne to lend him his assistance against the Emir Abderrahman. Accordingly, a Prankish army was sent to Spain, and this cam- paign terminated in the annexation of all the country north of the Ebro to the FrankisK empire. This new acquisition was called the Spanish mark (margraviate). A war against the Danes was in 810 terminated by a treaty of peace, which stipu- lated that the Eider river was to be considered as the boundary between the Danes and Franks ; and indeed this river has since continually been the boundary between Denmark, and Germany. To secure the boundaries in the east and south-east, Charlemagne founded there several margraviatcs, for instance ; the Avarian mark (comprising what is now called the arch-duchy of Austria) against the Avares (see Â§ 11); Friaul. etc. In the year 800 when Charlemagne happened to be at Rome, the pope (who for many substantial services, was highly indebted to him) placed the imperial crown upon his head, and thus, as it were, revived the Western Roman Empire. Charles the Great died in the year 814 at Ais-la-Chapelle, and was succeeded by his son Louis, sur- named the Pious, who was in point of mental power almost the reverse of his father. Louis the Pious died in 840. and left h'\" dominions to his three sons, Louis, Charles, and Lothaire, whi divided them by a treaty, concluded at Verdun in 843, in t^ Allowing manner : Louis (since surnamed the German) acquired Germany, whic* since that time has ever been separated from France, and where after the death of the last descendant of Louis (which occurred in 911) an elective monarchy was established, and so it continued, even so late as the year 1806. Louis the German had shortly before his death inherited the rights to the i^nperial croicn, as well as to Italy, Burgundy, part of Switzerland, to Alsace. Lor- raine, etc., and entailed these rights on his descendants and sue- 32 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. France â€” Kingdom of Italy â€” England. cessors to the German crown. They were realized for the first time by his grandson Arnulph (reigning in the period from 887 to 899), who not only was crowned as Roman-German emperor, but also brought the kingdom of Italy and Burgundy into a po- litical connection with Germany. Charles (surnamed the Bald) acquired France, which was ruled by his descendants until the year 987, when the Capetians supplanted the race of the Carlovingians. Lothairc acquired the imperial crown and the kingdom of Italy, and besides this a long tract of land situated between France and Germany, viz. Provence, Dauphimj, Bv.rgtindy, Al- sace, Lorraine and the Netherlands. But his race became extinct even so early as the year 875 ; and thus the German kings, his nearest relations, became the heirs of his rights. 15. As for England (see Â§ 4), all the seven kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy were united into one, under the government of Egbert, King of Wessex. This occurred in the year 827. Egbert was therefore the first King of England â€” a name de- rived from that of Anglia, the home of the Angles, and sub- stituted for the former name of Britannia by Egbert. During his reign, and for many years afterwards, the Normans (see Â§ 13) made frequent incursions into England, and sometimes overran the whole country. King Alfred the Great (who reigned from the year 871 to 901) opposed them with good success, but a hun- dred years after his death the Normans again broke into Eng- land, and were now completely victorious, so that in the period from lOlG to 1042 three Danish kings governed the country in succession (Swcn, Canute, and Hardicanute). In the year 1042, the Normans or Danes were driven out of England, and another Saxon King, Edward II., surnamed the Confessor, was placed upon the throne. Meanwhile the Normans had settled in France, and acquired there (at the end of the 9th century) a large tract SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 33 Norman Conquest of Englandâ€” Moore in Spain. of land, since called Normandy. William duke of Normandy, who was related to King Edward, made claim to the English tiirone, and after Edward's death, which occurred in 1U66, he in- vaded England, at the head of sixty thousand men, defeated his rival Harold (son of the mighty Count Godwin ; for Edward had left no children) in the battle of Hastings (on the 14th of Oct. lOGG), and became King of England. He was now called \\Vil- Ham the Conqueror.^ and is the ancestor of the still reigning royal family of Great Britain. 16. The Moors'va. Spain (see ^ 10) were in the beginning ruled by governors of the Caliphs then reigning at Damascus (the seat of the latter not being transferred to Bagdad until the year 754) ; but in 756 the Arabian prince Abderrahman founded an inde- pendent empire in Spain, and took his seat in Cordova (north-east, and 120 miles distant from Cadiz), which soon rose to be a splen- did city, and at one time numbered 1,000,000 inhabitants. The Moorish empire was at that time separated from that of the Christians by the Duero. Concerning the Christian empire, the little kingdom of Asturias, founded by Pelagio (see ^ 10), was since its first enlargement called the Kingdom of Leon. The Spanish marJc^ conquered by Charlemagne (see ^ 14), having meanwhile been divided into two counties, Barcelona and Navarre, and the count of Navarre having since assumed the royal title, there were now two Christian kingdoms in Spain; which, in the course of time, brought into existence the kingdoms of Aragon, Castile^ Galicia, the principality of Catalonia, etc. Portugal, being first a province of the united kingdoms of Cas- tile and Leon, became in 1139 an independent kingdom. The power of the Moors in Spain was more and more restricted by the conquests of the Christian kings, till in 1492 Granada, the last Moorish possession on the Pyrenean peninsula, was conquer- ed by the Queen Isabella of Castile, and King Ferdinand, of 2* 34 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Ferdinand and Isabellaâ€” Society in the Middle Ages. Aragon. At this time the kingdom of Aragon comprised not only Aragon, but the whole north-cast part of Spain, while the kin^'dom of Castile comprised all other parts ; and as Ferdinand and Isabella were united by marriage, all Spain came after their death under the sway, first of their daughter Johanna (or rather their son-in-law Philip), then of their grandson, the celebrated King Charles I. (or Charles V. as emperor of Germany), who entailed the Spanish crown on his descendants. 17 This sketch of the political history of Europe will suffice for the present ; and deferring the further particulars of it to the his^ torical introduction of each separate state, we shall now give a condensed description of the state of European culture in the mid- dle ages. Had the time of blooming and vigor of the Roman empire last- ed forever, there is no doubt but Roman culture would at last have prevailed throughout Europe. But the migration of nations (see ^ 2), and with it perpetual wars, interfered and destroyed almost the last remains of it. Thus a commencement was to be made anew. But a quiet and peaceful development being impos- sible at that time, matters went on in the following succession : 1. Improvement of warlike or military conditions. 2. Agriculture. 3. Foundation of new towns and cities. 4. Commercial intercourse and rudiments of industry. 5. A more general efficiency and propagation of Christianity, and subsequently the extension of the clerical power. G. The foundation of universities and the generalization of other schools. 7. The gradual improvement of sciences and fine arts. 8. Fresh life and activity in commercial and industrious enter- prises, generated by the Crusades. 9. Origination of free citizens and corporations. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 35 Social Progress in tiie Middle Ages. 10. New progress of sciences and fine arts. 11. The invention of gunpowder and of the art of printing ; the Reformation and the discovery of America, and of the passage by sea to India ; and the immense social and intellectual revolu- tions brought on by these events, whose consequences are still apparent. In the period from the latter time of the migration of nations until the crusades, Italy (as the former millennial seat of the Roman empire), Spain (as the seat of the industrious and intel- ligent Moors since the Sth century), and the Eastern empire (as retaining the remains of Roman culture) were to be considered as illuminated directly, and the other European countries as il- luminated indirectly, by the beams of the sun of culture. Mean- while the progress of culture went on in the above indicated man- ner. Thus we shall begin with the (fl.) Improvement of warlike or military conditions ; â€” of course only with reference to the Germanic tribes (see Â§Â§ 1, 2, 3, etc.), as all other European nations (with the exception of the Romans) lived at that time in a state of complete barbarity. Among the Germanic tribes it was the custom and practice to wage war in two different ways: viz , either to call to arms all freeborn war- riors under the command oi dukes elected by each tribe (this way .was less frequent, and chiefly used in defensive wars) ; or to select warriors of profession out of those freeborn men, who were upon terms of a particular political dependence with the com- mander-in-chief With this warfare the feudal system was closely connected. As soon as a foreign country was conquered) either the whole (as in the case of the Saxons in England, and of the Lombards in Italy), or some part of it (sometimes one third, but most frequently two thirds) was divided between the king (as commander-in-chief) and his military retinue ; each member of the latter receiving a lot, called Allodium, which as a patrimonial 36 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Feudal System â€” Agi-icultiu-eâ€” Bondage. estate was at Lis free disposition. The king, receiving a far greater lot than any member of his retinue, used to confer parts of it, by the name of fees (in Latin feuda or beneficia)^ ou single members of this retinue in usufruct for lifetime. The feoffees, called vassals, were bound to faith and homage towards the feofl'er, and to warfare in case of war. In this way all allodial proprietors became gradually feudal tenants also. The feoffer was under the obligation to protect his vassal, and for this reason many allodial proprietors, being incompetent to their own pro- tection, conferred their estate upon any powerful neighbor, and received it back again from him as a fee. At first the fees were not transmissible by inheritance, but in the course of time the heritable quality was partly conceded, partly usurped ; and since that time, only in case of felony the fee was allowed to be with- drawn. Considering the peculiar condition of society in the middle ages, it cannot be denied that the feudal system was quite adapted to it, and afforded many advantages. [b.) Agriculture, formerly in a more or less flourishing state throughout most of those European countries that were under the Eoman sway, but since the beginning of the migration of nations almost totally neglected (except in the Eastern empire), made but poor progress in the period from the year 476 till 752 (when the sway of the Carlovingians commenced), because the freeborn men being for -the most time engaged in warfare, gave themselves seldom the trouble to cultivate the soil, which thus was chiefly tilled by the bondsmen or serfs. Bondage or servitude had from the earliest time been in practice not only among the Germanos. but also among the Slavonians (see ^ 12 of the Intro- duction), and lias not, in most of the countries where it existed, been abolished before the last and the present centuries. It may indeed be called a kind of slavery, but in various respects it dif- fers from proper slavery, which was in use among the ancient SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 37 Foundation of Towns and Cities. Romans, Greeks, etc., and is still in use amongthe Mohammedans and other peoples ! â€” In the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries agriculture was in the Christian countries of Europe promoted chiefly by the endeavors of the monks ; and since the beginning of the crusades (at the end of the 11th century), when many bondsmen entered the armies of the cross, in order to partake of their privileges of personal freedom, agriculture and other branches of husbandry became more and more the occupation of free farmers, and at the same time attained a higher degree of importance. In the East- ern empire the culture of silk-ioorms was introduced during the reign of Justinian I. (527-565). The Moors in Spain managed the cultivation of the soil in an exemplary manner ; and even steep and sandy hills were by their perseverance transformed into fertile arable land. The meadows of Andalusia were never parched by the scorching sun, as the Moors took care to keep them humid by irrigating canals. Along the Guadalquivir river were situated more than 12,000 flourishing villages, and the township of Seville alone contained not less than 100,000 villages and farms. (f.) In speaking of the foKwlalioii of towns and cities since the commencement of European culture in general, we of course have ouly in view those countries which but then emerged from their state of barbarity, and where hitherto the people had more or less Tbeen accustomed to live in huts lying scattered about in the woods or open field. This was the custom among the ancient Germans (for the towns and cities on the left bank of the Rhine had been founded by the Romans), among the Poles, Magyars, Britons, and in general among all the northern nations of Eu- rope. In the north and north-east of Europe, the foundation of towns and cities, in the style of those in the southern countries, did not take place before the middle of the 13th century, and the few existing ones were not endowed with municipal laws before EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Roeskildeâ€” Moscow â€” Londonâ€” Constantinople. that time. In Sweden the city of BJocrkoc, on an island of the lake Maelar. (see ^ 9, of the Introduction), was indeed, even so early as iu the first half of the 9th century, distinguished by its numerous population, its riches and power ; but the country in general had but few towns of any importance. Roeskilde, the capital of Denmark until the year 1443, was founded at a very early period, and had since the 11th century a population of 100,000 inhabitants, and not less than 27 magnificent churches and monasteries ; but this was rather an exception from the rule. Moscoiv in Russia may have been founded in the 9th centur}', but it is more probable that its foundation did not take place before the middle of the 12th century. In 13G7 the first palace of stone was built here. The first foundation of London was laid by the Romans even so early as the year 52 ; in the beginning of the 7th century it was, says a contemporary, \" a commercial town frequented by many nations by sea and by land ;\" and since the 11th century, the commercial intercourse was still more ac- tive here ; yet until towards the end of the 12th century most of the houses here were built of wood and thatched, till in 1189 King Richard I. ordered all houses with more than two stories to be built of stone, and roofed with tiles or slates. In Germany, the lack of cities or fortified towns was first felt when the fierce Magyars or Huns (as they commonly were called, and from which name originated that of the Hungarians) made their plundering incursions at the end of the 9th, and in the beginning of the 10th century; and not until now most of the principal towns in the interior of Germany were founded. Constantinople was at that time not only the emporium, but also in other respects the most important city of Europe. Besides this capital, the Eastern empire had many other fine cities ; while in Italy those which had been founded by the ancient Romans, were multiplied by new SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY 39 Commercial Intercourseâ€” Industry. ones, for instance, by Venice. Likewise in Spain and in some parts of Prance, there were many cities of early origin. (d.) In the period from the 5th to the latter half of the 8th century, the conimercial intercourse as well as the iiidustry, was in general very insignificant, and almost entirely confined to Con- stantlnopk. where industry was considerably promoted by the luxury of the magnificent imperial court, and an important trade was at that time carried on with several maritime countries on the Mediterranean Sea. In the next period until the beginning of the crusades or of the 12th century, the Moors in Spain ex- celled all other nations of Europe in point of manufactures and other branches of industry. Their woollen cloth, silk stuffs, em- broideries in gold and silver, Morocco-leather, hardware, their ex- cellent workmanship in arms, etc. found everywhere in Europe as well as in Africa and Asia, a lucrative market. In the art of dyeing, the Moors were eminently skilled. Likewise the work- ing in the Spanish gold and silver mines was managed by them with ability and circumspection, and added greatly to their wealth. In other countries of Europe in the latter period, the commercial preponderance of Constantinople gradually went over to the Italian sea-towns of Venice, Pisa, Genoa and Amalfi (the last-named town is situated in the vicinity of Naples). These towns had risen to be independent commercial states, while in other western countries of Europe (with the exception of the Arabian part of Spain) the commercial intercourse was almost confined to trade by barter, or provision only for the daily supply. But now the circumstances there were more favorable. Indian and Levantine goods were sent from Constantinople by way of the Danube river up to Ratisbon (on the Danube), which was at that time the most considerable and populous city of Grermany, and mediated the intercourse not only between the eastern and west- ern countries, but also between the north-east part of Europe and \" 1 40 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT, Christianityâ€” Monastic Life. Italy. In France the southern cities, above all Marseilles^ traded with the Levant, while those of the north carried on commerce chiefly with England. Even the Slavonian tribes in the vicinity of the Elbe River and on the Baltic Sea, especially the citizens of Julin (on an island at the mouth of the Oder River; it was de- stro3\"cd in 1170), kept up a commercial intercourse with neigh- boring countries. The increasing number of towns and cities, the establishment of fairs, and the discovery of gold and silver mines in the Hartz (see ^ 7, k. Introd.) and in other parts of Germany were promoting the industry in those quarters. (e.) A more general effi,ciency and propagation of Christianity was almost impossible during the troubles and disturbances in the period of the migration of nations. Yet a roundabout ground of it was laid by the transplantation of vwnastic life from the dioceses of the oriental church to those of the occidental. This was effected by St. Benedict of Nursia, who in 529 founded a mon- astery on Mount Cassino, near Naples, that gave rise to the es- tablishment of monasteries in other countries of Europe. These institutions were not only the seminaries for nearly all those heroes of the faith, who in the earlier time of the middle ages, as missionaries, propagated Christianity among the pagan tribes of Europe, frequently at the risk of their lives ; but may likewise be considered as the only nurseries and preservers of classical literature and of sciences in general in those dark ages. With- out the monasteries, even genuine manuscripts of the Holy Bible might be very rare. That monks deserved well for their cultiva- tion of the soil, has already been mentioned ; and moreover they were engaged in handiwork, in the instruction of youth, in writ- ing chronicles, in copying classical manuscripts, etc. Before the time of Charlemagne, the pope^ as the visible head of the occiden- tal church, had but little influence or authority in temporal mat- ters ; but since he had placed the imperial crown upon the head SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 41 Papal Powerâ€” Instruction of the Peoijle. of this king (see ^ 14), he assumed the privilege of crowuing all his successors, and subsequently (in the next period until the 11 th century) the supreme legislative power in ecclesiastical matters, the supreme judicial power in the same matters and in all causes concerning the clergy, and the right of pronouncing the interdict (a papal prohibition to the clergy to celebrate the holy offices) against whole districts and even countries, and the anathema against persons, in cases of transgressions against the church. But the preponderance of the papal authority dated from the time of Pope Gregory VII. (1073-1085) and of the crusades (from the end of the 11th to that of the 13th century). Tho popes now went so far as to declare that God had given them all the kingdoms of heaven and earth ; they actually dethroned kings, treated them as their vassals, and continued for more than three hundred years to exercise an almost undisputed sway over both kings and peoples of the Christian world. It was about the pe- riod of the reign of Imwcentus III. (1198-1216) that the power of the pope was at its highest pitch. But after Boniface VIII. (1294-1303) had been deeply humbled, and treated with con- tempt by King Philip IV. of France, the papal power went rap- idly to decay. (/) It cannot be denied that the Roman Catholic church has done far more for 'promoting knowledge and instruction than the oHental church, especially in the middle ages. Yet many kings were not behind in their endeavors, among them Charlemagne, who established a great number of schools and interested himself even personally in the progress of the pupils. In the preceding period, the objects of instruction in the higher schools consisted of the so-called seven liberal arts, viz. study of the. classical liter- ature, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. The best schools of this kind were at that time those of Cambridge, York and Canterbury in England, from whence sci- 42 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Schools â€” Universities. entific knowledge gradually spread over the European continent. In the Eastern e7)ipire the Roman literature had lost its strength- ening freshness by the prevalence of a depraved taste ; all attain- ments in literature and science were nearly concentrated in Con- stantinople i yet until the reign of Justinian I. (527-5G5) there was still a renowned academy at Athens. The 31oors in Spain, so distinguished in other branches of human exertions, excelled also in the cultivation of sciences, especially in the period from the 8th to the 12th century. Cordova was the seat of literary institutions, academies and numerous common schools. The academies were celebrated, and much resorted to from other countries. Both Christians and Jews attended the instruction in matters of philosophy, medicine, mathematical and physical sciences. In the last-named period (752-1100) France. Ger- many and Switzerland were possessed of excellent cloister, cathe- dral and episcopal schools in Paris and Normandy, at Corvey, Fulda, Paderborn and Hildcsheim, and at St. Gall. About the same time the first ukiversities of Europe were founded. The most celebrated among them were those of Salerno (in the vicin- ity of Naples), of Bologna (in the States of the Church), and of Paris. The object of instruction in the first was principally med- icine, in the second jurisprudence, and in the third theology and philosophy. At the medical faculty or seminary of Salerno, founded in the beginning of the I2th century, and endowed with the privileges of a university in 1150, it was chiefly Arabian pro- fessors who directed the instruction. In 1119, or about that time, the university of Bologna took its rise ; but its glory dates from the professorship of the celebrated legist Irnerius (flHO) ; in 1158 it was endowed with the privileges of a university by Emperor Frederick I, About the year 1200, when another re- nowned professor, named Azzo, illustrated this university, it was frequented by 10,000 students. It must be remarked here, that SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 43 Universitiesâ€”Literary Productions. many of the latter were indeed youth ; yet the greatest part of those students consisted of men of rank, or who filled high offices. For them was the knowledge of the Roman law (which was ex- plained here, and which had become the common law in most of the Eui'opean countries) indispensable ; and as at that time the art of printing was not yet invented, and thus the study of books impossible, it was a matter of course, that they betook themselves to universities. The title of Doctor came first in use at the University of Bologna. Never did any university maintain its renown so long, nor influence church and state to such a de- gree as that of Paris. Though the opinion that its origin might be dated from the days of Charlemagne, is untenable, yet it orig- inated at a very early period, perhaps in the beginning of the 10th century. In the 12th century this university numbered among its professors several men distinguished for their attain- ments in literature and science, of whom Peter Lombardus (+1164), a disciple of Abelard, was the most celebrated. His \" libri sententiarum,\" comprise a theological system that for cen- turies vindicated its authority among the theologians. The uni- versities of Oxford and Cambridge are of so early origin too, that the period of their foundation cannot be stated with certainty. Before the end of the 13th century, there had been founded uni- versities at Padua, Naples, Reggio, Rome and Treviso ; at Mont- pellier, Orleans and Toulouse ; and at Salamanca in Spain. [g.) The literary productions in the western countries of Eu- rope during the period from the 5th to the latter half of the Sth century, consisted only of philosophical and church historical works, and were entirely written in Latin. Bcda. Venerabilis, author of a history of the Christian church in England, intro- duced first the Christian chronology into the western countries of Europe. In this period too, the first essays in the art of painting (wholly neglected since the first period of the Roman 44 EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT. Literary\" Productionsâ€” Fine Arts â€” Architecture. emperors) were made, and a transition from ancient to modern architecture was effected by the Gothic style (invented by the Ostrogoths, but in the course of time much improved and brought to its high state of grandeur), and likewise by the tasteless Lom- bardic style mingled with that of the Byzantines. In the Eastern empire the Latin language prevailed until the latter half of this period, when it began to be supplanted by a corrupt- ed Greek dialect. Literary productions at that time were rather insipid, and poetry was almost confined to the epigram. The church of St. Sophia, built in Constantinople during the reign of Justinian L (527-5G3), was considered as a pattern of the early Christian architecture, the peculiar properties of which were the form of a cross, the cupola and the semicircular arch resting on cubical capitals. It was not until the 9th century that the arts of painting and sculpture began to be improved in the Eastern empire. â€” In the next period (752-1100) it was chiefly the Moors in Spain who excelled in poetry. The ballad was devised by them. Their architectonic performances in the Arabian style (an improved imitation of the Byzantine style) were distinguished for their easy forms and rich ornaments. In scientifical matter they chiefly cultivated the mathematical and physical sciences. Edrisi.( + 1180) who made his studies at Cor- dova, wrote several geographical works of great value. In the other European countries (with the exception of the Eastern em- pire) the Latin ceased to be a living language, since in the 9th century the Romanic and Germanic languages had been im- proved with more success. In the same period (752-1100) sev- eral poetical and other works were, for the first time, written in German, and the grand cathedrals of Bamberg, Worms, Mentz, Spires, etc., built in the mixed Lorabardo-Byzantine style. In the 1 1th century, the first feudal castles were built ; among them the celebrated Wartburg (now belonging to Saxe Weimar), in SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. 46 The Crusades. 10G7. About the same time music and painting on glass were cultivated successfully. (h.) As the Crusades, nndertaken since the end of the llth century by European nations for the recovery of the Holy Land, were attended by most important consequences with regard to the social condition and culture of Europe, we must previously give some historical outlines of them. The Holy Land, or Pal- estine, had, since the end of the 4th century, formed part of the Eastern empire, but in the 7th century been conquered by the Arabs. The latter granted free exercise of religion to the Chris- tian population, and in general, treated them with equity. lu 968 the sultan of Egypt took possession of Palestine, which continued to be under the sway of himself and his successors until the year 1078, when the Scldschuks (or Turks, who from other Turkish tribes differed only by their particular name, which they had derived from that o-f their former sultan, named Seldschuk) subdued the country ; and by them, the Christians, especially the pilgrims to Jerusalem, were often treated with cruelty and scorn. The pilgrims returned to Europe and gave an account of the "
