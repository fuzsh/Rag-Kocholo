In VIII Corps area, 87th Div takes Moircy and Jenneville. 11th Armd Div attacks with CCA toward Hubermont, stopping E of Rechrival, and with CCB clears Chenogne and woods to N. CCA, 9th Armd Div, drives toward Senonchamps. 101st A/B Div, in Bastogne area, gives fire support to 11th Armd Div on its left and 6th Armd Div (III Corps) on its right. 17th A/B Div relieves 28th Div in Neufchâteau area. III Corps contains enemy salient SE of Bastogne, 4th Armd Div holds corridor into Bastogne and supports 35th Div with fire. 35th Div partially clears Lutrebois and reaches crossroads SE of Marvie, but makes no headway in vicinity of Villers-la-Bonne-Eau (Belgium) and Harlange (Luxembourg). In region E of Bastogne, 6th Armd Div takes Neffe, Bizery, and Mageret, but then loses Mageret.\n\n6th Army Group: Germans launch offensive, designated Operation NORDWIND, against U.S. Seventh Army. In XV Corps area, two-pronged enemy thrust forces 106th Cav Gp, 44th Div, and 100th Div to give ground. 44th Div bears brunt of enemy’s right flank drive, which penetrates positions NW of Rimling. 100th Div, caught between the 2 attack forces, withdraws its right flank, exposed by withdrawal of TF Hudelson (VI Corps); enemy infiltrators are cleared from Rimling, on left flank. Elements of TF Harris (63rd Div) help check enemy. RCT 141, 36th Div, moves up to plug gap between XV and VI Corps. In VI Corps area, enemy drives salient into left flank of corps S of Bitche.
