Apart from the book before you, the uranium project resulted in an edition of contributions to a conference,* a double issue of Der Anschnitt, Zeitschrift für Kunst und Kultur im Bergbau (2–3, 1998), articles, research papers, several conferences in Germany, a seminar in Washington DC and exhibitions in both Germany and the Czech Republic. Indirectly, Dr. Karlsch’s interest in uranium matters led him to the subject of his last book, Hitlers Bombe, which was published, to much acclaim and some controversy, by Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt in Munich in 2005. It summarizes the findings the authors considered important. Both the English and German versions were based on the same material, although they were drafted by Dr. Karlsch and Professor Zeman independently. The Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, mark the border between Bohemia and Saxony. In Czech, the mountain range is called Krusˇné hory, or the Cruel Mountains.

Regiments of Red Army infantry, cavalry and tanks threw innumerable banners and standards, taken from Adolf Hitler’s armies, at Stalin’s feet. The day of torrential rain was charged with symbolism: once again, through endurance and suffering, Russia had won a great war. Mikhail Kutuzov’s soldiers had once thrown the standards of Napoleon’s armies at the feet of Tsar Alexander in the same way. In that summer of 1945, Marshal Zhukov, the victor of Stalingrad and Berlin, stood next to Stalin. A month later, at Potsdam on 24 July, Harry S. Truman told Stalin that America possessed an atomic weapon. The third and the last conference of the Second World War’s Big Three was given the code name Terminal. It was to take place in Berlin, where few buildings escaped damage during the Red Army’s final sweep into the city. Cecilienhof, the residence of the former Crown Prince of Hohenzollern in nearby Potsdam, was proposed as the most suitable venue for the conference. It had a large ballroom, and the Berlin suburb of Babelsberg offered accommodation for the delegates and their staff. On their way to Schloss Cecilienhof, the delegates were able to avoid the center of Potsdam, which had been heavily damaged, and cross the Jungfernsee on a pontoon bridge. The journey took about ten minutes by car. The eighth plenary session in Potsdam started on 24 July, at 3:l5 in the afternoon. Winston Churchill immediately complained about the situation of British military and diplomatic missions in Romania and Bulgaria. He told Stalin that he “would be astonished to read the catalogue of incidents to our mission in Bucharest and Sofia. They were not free to go abroad. An iron curtain had been rung down.”1 The session in Potsdam was, however, memorable for another reason. When it ended late in the afternoon, the delegates stood around in twos and threes, chatting. Churchill saw Truman go to Stalin, and the two men were left alone with their interpreters. Churchill, standing about five yards away, watched them with close attention. He agreed with Truman that Stalin would have to be told about the successful test of the atom bomb in New Mexico, which had taken place ten days before the meeting in Potsdam. In his memoirs, Churchill noted:\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n4\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nUranium Matters\n\nI knew what the President was going to do. What was vital to measure was its effect on Stalin. I can see it as if it were yesterday! He seemed delighted. A new bomb! Of extraordinary power! Probably decisive on the whole Japanese war! What a bit of luck! This was my impression at the moment, and I was sure that he had no idea of the significance of what he was being told. Evidently in his intense toils and stresses the atomic bomb had played no part. If he had had the slightest idea of the revolution in world affairs which were in progress his reactions would have been obvious. Nothing would have been easier than for him to say “Thank you so much for telling me about your new bomb. I of course have no technical knowledge. May I send my expert in these nuclear sciences to see your expert tomorrow morning?” But his face remained gay and genial and the talk between these two potentates soon came to an end. As we were waiting for our cars I found myself near Truman. “How did it go?” I asked. “He never asked a question” he replied. I was certain therefore that at that date Stalin had no special knowledge of the vast process of research upon which the United States and Britain had been engaged for so long, and of the production for which the United States had spent over four hundred million pounds in an heroic gamble.2\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Churchill were convinced of the need to shield the nuclear project from German intelligence. The requirement for absolute secrecy rebounded on Stalin as well as on most of the members of Churchill’s own cabinet. Neither the British war cabinet, nor the Defence Committee, had discussed the bomb before it was dropped. In a telegram to Eden on l8 April l945, Churchill proposed that the Americans should advance into the region south of Stuttgart before the French troops reached it. Churchill believed that German nuclear research installations were to be found there, and he asked Eden to treat his suggestion as “background in deep shadow.”3 Truman had lunched with Churchill on l8 July, and the first part of their conversation concerned the atomic bomb. It was left out of the record for the cabinet, and only Anthony Eden and Sir John Anderson received a note of it. Truman asked Churchill what should be done about telling the Russians. The President was determined to tell them, but was uncertain about the timing. Should he do so at the end of the conference in Potsdam? Churchill advised him to link the news with the experiment\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n5\n\nin New Mexico, “a new fact of which he and we had only just had knowledge. Therefore we must have a good answer to any question ‘why did you not tell us this before?’”4\n\nThe Race for the Ultimate Weapon The race for the atomic bomb was, in the end, won by America. The explosions over the New Mexico desert, and then over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer 1945, marked the beginning of a new age. The scientists who had fled from fascist Europe, where Hitler made a point of distrusting “Jewish physics,” helped to draw the attention of the governments in Washington and London to the potential threat of Nazi Germany developing the “ultimate weapon.” Leo Szilard helped persuade Albert Einstein to write, on 2 August 1939, a letter to president Roosevelt, warning him of the destructive potential of nuclear fission. Einstein’s letter also contained a reference to the importance of the uranium mines at Jáchymov, which had come under Nazi control after the Munich agreement in September 1938. In response to the letter, Roosevelt established a uranium commission in October 1939, in order to determine the feasibility of building the bomb. Other, similar impulses came from Britain. Between the two wars, nuclear scientists had formed a small international group: they knew each other and worked closely together. When Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman concluded that they brought about nuclear fission in their experiments, they reported on their findings in a wellknown scientific journal, Naturwissenschaften, at the beginning of 1939. Research in the instability of matter was marked, however, by bad timing. Important advances were made about the time of the outbreak of the Second World War. The international group of scientists fell apart, and articles on their work disappeared from academic journals. As politicians grasped the possibility of developing the ultimate weapon, secrecy and military necessity came to dominate the scientists’ work. After the defeat of France in May l940, Joliot Curie, the leading French nuclear physicist, stayed in Paris and sent two of his assistants to England. They brought heavy water in tin cans, and continued their work on slow neutrons in Cambridge. The team at the Cavendish Laboratory discovered that, in the course of neutron reactions, plutonium emerged. Virtually unknown in nature, it behaved like uranium 235. In April 1940, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, refugee scientists in England, wrote a memorandum suggesting that a lump of pure uranium\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n6\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nUranium Matters\n\n235 would create chain reaction necessary for the bomb. They also proposed an industrial method for separating uranium 235 from uranium 238. They also forecast the horrors of the bomb, and explored its strategic and moral implications. A five kilogram bomb would liberate the energy of several thousand tons of dynamite, causing radiation fatal to living beings long after the explosion. The British government established the “MAUD committee,” which concerned itself with the feasibility of producing the nuclear weapon. In July l94l, the committee reported that it would be possible to make a bomb, which was “likely to lead to decisive results in the war.” Churchill made the MAUD report available to Roosevelt. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour took place on 7 December 1941, and the German declaration of war on the United States followed four days later. Roosevelt was anxious to receive British cooperation and wrote to Churchill about a joint atomic project. The British response was measured, because they wanted their own project—code-named Tube Alloys—with American cooperation. In the summer of 1942, the Americans began to construct a large technological venture around research hitherto confined largely to university laboratories. The atomic project was given the code name “Manhattan,” and Lt. General Leslie R. Groves, a West Point graduate who had supervised the building of the Washington Pentagon, became its manager. There was some hesitation over the appointment of Robert Oppenheimer as the head of research. A university teacher of theoretical physics with an international reputation, he was more interested in pure research than in its application. He was also regarded as something of a political risk. When his appointment was confirmed, Oppenheimer began bringing together the best available scientists in America. He assumed that about 150 of them could successfully complete the project; eventually, their number grew to some 2,500. By the end of 1942, the advantage of the American project became apparent. The British knew that the US had cornered the Canadian market in uranium and heavy water for the next two years, and that their own project would have to move to North America. The British tried to come in on the US project, but the Americans were reluctant to accept them. The exchange of information ceased, and the western allies remained united by the fear that Germany would beat them in the atomic race. On 27 February 1943, Churchill telegraphed Roosevelt that “My whole understanding, was that everything was on the basis of fully sharing the results as equal partners. I have no record, but I shall be very much surprised if the President’s recollection does not square with\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n7\n\nthis.”5 Churchill was convinced that the possession of the bomb would provide the key to national power after the war, and he tried hard, in August l943, to convince Roosevelt to sign the Quebec agreement. It helped the British to participate in the Manhattan Project, and led to joint purchase and utilization of uranium supplies. The partners in the agreement promised never to use the bomb against third parties without the other’s consent, nor to pass on atomic information to third parties. All available British scientists joined the US project, while the AngloFrench team from Cambridge moved to Canada. They could not go on working in Britain, and the Americans would not have them. The US government had little liking for the Free French, while the leader of the Anglo-French team was unacceptable to American scientists. After the Quebec agreement was signed, the Americans underwrote the British project in Canada. John Cockroft, the English Nobel Prizewinning physicist, became its head. Canada joined Britain and America in the nuclear project as an additional partner and the main provider of uranium. Canadian officials sometimes played the role of an intermediary between Britain and America. On 2 December l942, Enrico Fermi successfully set up a self-sustaining chain reaction in a reactor built into a squash court at Chicago University. In addition to the reactors built by DuPont, the Manhattan Project had six other reactors, which produced uranium 235 by three different methods. All of this—as well as the construction of the first experimental bomb—was achieved at a time when the US armament industry was nearly stretched to its limit producing conventional weapons, as well as advanced new equipment such as radar. The atomic project cost the American government some $2 billion. The Manhattan Project scientists fulfilled their objective and delivered the bomb to the US government. The first plutonium bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert on 16 July 1945. The Germans had signed unconditional capitulation and the Potsdam conference was to start the following day. In the morning of 6 August, a uranium bomb was exploded over Hiroshima, and on 9 August a plutonium bomb destroyed Nagasaki. Stalin declared war on Japan on 8 August, and on 14 August, the Japanese emperor declared his willingness to capitulate. Throughout the war, the Allied intelligence services’ fear that Germany would develop its own atomic weapon was never quite allayed. The Germans had the necessary technology and scientific strength. They had Jáchymov under their control and, after the occupation of France and Belgium, came into possession of large stores of uranium. Yet early\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n8\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nUranium Matters\n\nin the war, and at least until the first months of 1942, it seemed that Germany would win the war with conventional weapons alone. The political will of the Nazi leadership to create the weapon did not remain constant, and the German scientific effort was not centralized on the scale of the Manhattan Project. On 29 April 1939, the president of the Physikalisch–Technische Reichsanstalt, Professor Abraham Esau, organized the foundation meeting of the Uranium Society (Uranverein). Several research groups joined as members: Nobel Prize winner Werner Heisenberg and his colleagues in Leipzig and Berlin; the scientists from the Ordnance Office (Heereswaffenamt), who were working under Kurt Diebner in GottowKummersdorf to the south of Berlin; a group around Paul Harteck in Hamburg; and the physicists at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Medicine in Heidelberg, with Walter Bothe at their head. Nikolaus Riehl, a pupil of Hahn, also joined the Uranium Club. As head of the research division of the Auergesellschaft, Riehl offered the Heereswaffenamt the services of his department. Early in December 1939, Heisenberg delivered a report on the “possibility of using nuclear fission as a technical source of energy” to the Heereswaffenamt. It outlined plans for the building of a nuclear reactor. An effective moderator, which would slow down neutrons without absorbing them, was required. Graphite and heavy water were considered: a complicated electrolytical process was required for the production of heavy water. The technology became available to the Germans after the occupation of Norway and the merger of Norsk Hydro in Rjukan with IG Farbenindustrie. Norsk Hydro was obliged to increase production, making it available exclusively to the German Reich. In the summer of 1940, the Wehrmacht overran France, the Netherlands and Belgium, acquiring large supplies of uranium. Though the director of the Union Minie` re, Edgar Sengier, had ordered the shipment of uranium and radium reserves to New York in September 1939, some remained in Belgium and fell into German hands. Beginning in July 1940, the German companies Auergesellschaft and Degussa began purchasing uranium compounds from the Union Minire. The largest lot (1,244 tons) was secured by Roges GmbH, a German war materials company, in May 1942. It also made purchases in occupied France and bought further 200 tons of uranium compound from Union Minire. Until the summer of 1944, the Belgian company assisted the Auergesellschaft with the purification of uranium oxide.6 Germany’s own production of uranium remained relatively small during the war, and uranium mining enjoyed no special priority. The\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n9\n\nGermans took little interest in the known reserves of uranium in Bulgaria and in Portugal. In Jáchymov, the mining of uranium lingered on and no attempts were made to increase production. Only the mines at Schmiedeberg in Silesia were enlarged during the war. In autumn 1939, the Heereswaffenamt requested the Auergesellschaft to help with the processing of uranium and, within a few weeks, the company built a plant at Oranienburg, with the capacity of about one ton of uranium oxide a month.7 The Degussa plant in Frankfurt am Main followed, and from the end of 1944, another plant was built at Berlin-Grünau.8 Initially, the military was more concerned with maintaining an adequate supply of luminous paint than with the nuclear project. Early in 1942, the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht assumed the requirement of 7 grams of radium, in addition to 1.5 grams for the Italian and the Japanese armies. Three grams of radium were produced by Joachimsthal; the rest of the requirement was met with deliveries from France and Belgium. This covered the uranium needs of the Wehrmacht for three years.9 The Germans had enough uranium to make the bomb.10 After the occupation of France, they also acquired the cyclotron at the Joliot Curie institute. The cyclotron was to stay in Paris, and German scientists were to have access to it.11 Cyclotrons were subsequently constructed in Germany at the institutes of Walter Bothe at Heidelberg and Gerhard Hoffmann in Leipzig, and at the Reich Post Office laboratories at Miersdorf and Berlin-Lichterfelde. In the meanwhile, experimental work was started in Hamburg and Berlin. Heisenberg and Karl Friedrich von Weizsäcker had a laboratory built on the site of the Institute of Biology and Virus Research at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft at Berlin-Dahlem. The laboratory was known as the “Virus House.” Their experiments, based on Fritz Houtermans’ work on the release of nuclear chain reactions, confirmed that the only two suitable moderators were graphite and heavy water.* The Ura*\n\nEven by the standards of an abnormal era, Houtermans led an extraordinary life. A half Jewish communist, he fled from Hitler’s Germany to the Soviet Union in 1935. He was arrested during the great purges and delivered to the Nazis after the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact in the autumn 1939. He was then put into the care of the Gestapo and released after Max von Laue’s intervention. Houtermans found employment in Manfred von Ardenne’s team at Berlin-Lichterfelde and worked for the Nazi regime in order to save his life. In the spring 1941, he warned an American agent of the German nuclear programme and in the autumn he took part in the plunder of the Soviet laboratories in Kiev and Kharkov. After the war, his role in nuclear research fell into oblivion. (cf. Paul Lawrence Rose, Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project, 135 et seq.)\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n10\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nUranium Matters\n\nnium Society put its faith in heavy water. Heisenberg established that the chain reaction of natural uranium created element 94, or plutonium. In September 1941, he knew that the way to the construction of a nuclear bomb was clear. The reason why he did not complete the work are still disputed by scientists and historians. Did Heisenberg hesitate to deliver the bomb to Hitler? Did his project simply lack resources after having been put on the back burner by the Nazis? Or did it suffer from conceptual difficulties in connection with his estimates of “critical mass?” At the end of October, the legendary meeting between Heisenberg and Niels Bohr took place in Copenhagen. The two men were unable to establish common ground. While Bohr feared that Heisenberg wanted to pick his brain and convince him to cooperate with the Germans, his former protégé believed that Bohr was unaware of his reservations with regard to the Nazis. In the autumn of 1941, it seemed as though a German victory was assured, and they had no need for any miraculous products of science, later known as “Wunderwaffen.” The military lost interest in nuclear research and the Heereswaffenamt passed on responsibility for the project to the Reich Research Office (Reichsforschungsrat). On 26 February 1942, the office held a conference of nuclear physicists in Berlin. The captains of the armaments industry kept their distance, and the Reich leaders also seemed rather lackadaisical in regard to the military uses of nuclear fission. On 21 March 1942, Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that: “Researches in the field of destruction of the atom have succeeded so far that they could be possibly considered for the conduct of the current war. The tiniest input has such an immense power of destruction that one looks forward with some horror to the course of the war, should it last still longer, or to a later war.”12 The German nuclear project was divided among several institutes, among which two were outstanding: Heisenberg’s group at the KaiserWilhelm Institute of Physics in Berlin, and the Heereswaffenamt group under the direction Kurt Diebner at Gottow, near Berlin. The key theoretical question concerned how to achieve critical mass, i.e. the correct amount of fissionable material (U 235 or plutonium) needed to maintain an explosive chain reaction while avoiding a spontaneous explosion. Estimating critical mass would be a deciding factor in determining whether the construction of the bomb should be attempted. A meeting took place in Berlin on 4 June 1942, in which Albert Speer, the minister for armaments, General Leeb, the head of the Heereswaffenamt, General Field Marshal Milch and other top military officials took\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n11\n\npart. The generals showed some interest in the possibility of building a nuclear weapon. Questioned by Milch, Heisenberg stated that an atomic bomb, with enormous destructive power, should not be larger than a pineapple. After Heisenberg referred to the enormous investments required, Speer wanted to know what kind of a sum the scientists had in mind. Weizsäcker mentioned a sum that seemed ridiculously low and it became clear to Speer and to the military present that the project could not be significant for the conduct of the war.13 There were no more meetings between Speer and Heisenberg. Although Speer was not convinced of the practical value of nuclear research, he went on supporting it in a modest way. In 1943 he set aside 3 million Reichsmarks (RM) for it, and 3.6 million RM in 1944.14 Hitler himself remained skeptical about the nuclear project. In addition, he suffered from deep distrust of “Jewish physics” and dismissed anything having to do with Albert Einstein out of hand. Still, the leaders of the Third Reich may have known more about the US Manhattan project than had been assumed. The Sicherheitsdienst had tapped the transatlantic telephone connection and broke the radio traffic code between Moscow and the Soviet embassy in Washington.15 The information thus acquired was passed on to scientists close to the SS. In addition, the Germans and the Japanese received reports on the Manhattan project from Spanish agent Alcazar de Velasco early in 1944.16 We have as yet no evidence on the uses the Nazis made of the fragmentary information they acquired on the British-American program. Prominent scientists and heads of the armaments industry remained convinced that nuclear explosives could not be manufactured in time to influence the outcome of the war. After the spring of 1943, Heisenberg made no more references to the “explosive.” The Allies, on the other hand, interpreted the situation differently, believing they were in a technological race with Nazi Germany. Assaults by British commandos and the Norwegian resistance in February, and the attacks by the RAF in November 1943, paralyzed Norsk Hydro’s production of heavy water near Vemork. A ferry was sunk which was to bring the remaining heavy water to Germany in February 1944. In any case, the heavy water plants in Norway were dismantled in the middle of 1944 and shipped to Germany. New methods of producing heavy water were developed and new plants were built at the Leuna Werke near Merseburg. In the meanwhile, experimental work in Germany had advanced. Kurt Diebner’s group made important discoveries, leaving the achievements of Heisenberg’s group behind. At the end of 1943, Professor Walther\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n12\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nUranium Matters\n\nGerlach of Munich took over the running of the Uranium Society, and attempted to make peace between the various research groups there. At the same time, the growing intensity of Allied air attacks prompted the relocation of nuclear research projects under the Reich Research Office to Freiburg, Hechingen, Heidelberg in South Germany and Stadtilm in Thuringia. Heisenberg and his colleagues believed that Germany’s defeat was within sight. During 1944 and 1945, they concentrated on one task: to set off chain reaction in a uranium machine (nuclear reactor). In a cave at Haigerloch, near Tübingen, the final experiments were begun. Early in March 1945, the Heisenberg group was on the threshold of achieving self-contained chain reaction.17 Other research groups passed beyond that stage, and historians, who had focused their attention on the activities of the most eminent member of the Uranium Society, were long loath to acknowledge this fact. Apart from Heisenberg and Kurt Diebner in Gottow and later at Stadtilm, there were at least two more groups working independently of each other in the atomic field.18 They were the research groups of the Reichspost at Berlin-Lichterfelde, under Manfred von Ardenne; and at Miersdorf, with Dr. Georg Otterbein at its head; as well as a little-known SS research group divided between Thuringia, Austria and Bohemia. In addition to its routine work, the research department of the Reich Post Office took over some important military research, including enciphering and radar development. Dr. Wilhelm Ohnesorge, the minister of post and a close party comrade of Hitler since 1920, wanted to give his department extra political weight by supporting research. Ohnesorge had at his disposal a scientific think-tank based in Kleinmachnow, near Berlin.19 In December 1939, Manfred von Ardenne drew his attention to the “unusual importance of the discoveries by Hahn and Strassmann.”20 It was a shrewd political move, as the post office had a large fund for basic research and an expert minister who carried weight in the Nazi hierarchy. In January 1940, Ohnesorge decided to support the project “for the technical development of process and production in the field of atom disintegration.”21 Ardenne started building a powerful apparatus for the production of radioactive isotopes and a cyclotron, which became operative at the beginning of 1944. New Post Office research institutes were established at Kleinmachnow and at Miersdorf. Equipment belonging to\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n13\n\nthe main institute at Berlin-Lichterfelde, such as its high tension apparatus and heavy cyclotron, was duplicated at Miersdorf. Ohnesorge was determined to deliver the first “uranium bomb” to his Führer. He reported to Hitler on several occasions on the work in progress; in June 1942, Hitler was amused by the thought that his minister of posts should be engaged in the development of new weapons. The research conducted by the Reichspost, Heereswaffenamt and SS in the autumn of 1944 was further advanced than it has been hitherto assumed. After the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in July 1944, Himmler’s SS became considerably more powerful. Himmler pressed for the transfer of all important armaments and research projects under SS control. Nuclear weapons fell into the same category as the V-Waffen (i.e. rockets and jet fighters). SS General Dr. Hans Kammler, the head of Gruppe C of the SS economic and administrative directorate, was in charge of the considerable enterprise, including extensive underground projects.22 Himmler and the SS began to assert their influence when the life expectancy of the Third Reich was low, right before defeat created total chaos. It is not clear how far Kammler was able to pursue the high technology projects under his control. It is also hard to establish whether the scientists who cooperated with the SS, and who worked in the underground complexes in Austria, Thuringia, Silesia and Bohemia achieved significant results. In his 2005 study entitled Hitlers Bombe, Rainer Karlsch threw new light on the dilemma of the German bomb. He argued that when Hitler started making references to the Wunderwaffe in the summer of 1944, he had a nuclear weapon in mind. There exists evidence that, in 1944 and 1945, small test explosions took place on Rügen and in Thuringia, taking the lives of prisoners of war and of other prisoners.23 Stalin apparently kept the film of a test explosion in his desk in the Kremlin. The Allies’ fear that Hitler might possess a nuclear bomb by no means decreased as the war went on. The influential publisher of a scientific magazine, Paul Rosbaud, was the most important source for the British on the German atomic endeavor. He was in touch with prominent scientists and kept sending alarming reports to London.24 In 1944, General Groves decided to establish a specialized unit that was to gather intelligence on the German atomic program. Lt. Col. Boris T. Pash became the commander of the unit, which was called the “Alsos.” Pash’s scientific adviser was Dutch physicist Samuel A. Goudsmit.25 Pash set up office in London in 1944, with Captain Horace C. Calvert as his liaison officer. Calvert discovered that the Germans had acquired large stores of urani-\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n14\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nUranium Matters\n\num near Brussels when they occupied Belgium, and that Auer-Gesellschaft processed the ore. The Alsos mission arrived in liberated Paris on 25 August 1944. They contacted Joliot Curie straightaway, who knew much less about the German effort than the Americans hoped. In the middle of November in Strassburg, Pash discovered a German physical laboratory and some documentary material. Goudsmit thought that it proved that the Germans neither had the bomb, nor were they able to construct it.26 In retrospect, Pash regarded the finding that the German atomic weapon presented no threat with pride. He expressed the view that this was the most important intelligence discovery of the war, and alone justified the existence of the Alsos.27 Groves regarded the Alsos mission as completed when the remainder of the Belgian uranium was located. However, the hunt for German atomic scientists continued; many were found at Heidelberg, Hechingen, Stadtilm and in Bavaria. After the end of the war, ten prominent German physicists, including Hahn and Heisenberg, were interned for six months at an English country house known as Farm Hall, near Cambridge. All their conversations were secretly recorded. The British wanted to know whether the Germans had hidden away nuclear material and research reports, and wanted to prevent German scientists from going to work for the Soviet Union. When the Germans heard that the US bomb was used on Hiroshima, they did not believe the news. After becoming aware of the extent of the US-British project, and of its success, Otto Hahn said to his colleagues: “If the Americans have the atomic bomb then you’re all second-raters. Poor old Heisenberg.”28 In reply to the news of the explosion of the atomic bomb, and in an attempt to give an outline of the history of their own project, the German scientists drafted a press release. They stressed that German nuclear research did not center on the development of a nuclear explosive. This later led to the legend that German scientists slowed down their work to keep from delivering the bomb to Hitler. After losing the scientific and technological race, they moved to occupy the moral high ground.* The observation that history is often no more than propaganda of the victors is reflected in the historiography of the atomic bomb. There exists a whole library of books on the making of the bomb, and only a few vol*\n\nRobert Jungk’s book, Brighter Than Thousands Suns, published in 1956, did much to give that view wide circulation. See also the Bibliographical note at the end of Part 1.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n15\n\numes on the work connected with the production of a small thermonuclear weapon in Germany. The Japanese nuclear program suffered a similar fate. In the 1970s, the American press reported that the Japanese also had a nuclear program. Japan was among the first three countries in the world with a cyclotron.29 Professor Yoshio Nishina was the key person in the project code-named NI and financed by the military. NI had been started in July 1941, five months before the attack on Pearl Harbour. Nishina had spent eight years before the war in Europe, studying with Rutherford in Cambridge and Bohr in Copenhagen. In Japan he became the “father of new physics,” and in 1931 he was given his own laboratory at the University of Tokyo. An independent research project was started in Japan by the navy, under the code name F-Go Program, around the summer of 1942. The scientific head of the project was Dr. Bunsaku Arakatsu.30 Arakatsu had also spent a few years abroad, including time at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge under Rutherford. In 1927, Arakatsu studied at Berlin University (today the Humboldt-Universität) under Einstein, becoming a member of Einstein’s circle of friends. Next to Nishina, Arakatsu, who taught physics at the University of Kyoto, was the most prominent nuclear physicist in Japan. Japanese research projects, however, suffered from shortages of uranium and a dearth of large energy plants. The most important resources of uranium were located on the Korean peninsula, and an industrial complex, run by the Japanese navy, was therefore developed at Hungman (Konan in Japanese). A vast fertilizer factory was built at Hungman, as well as a hydroelectric plant, a propellants plant and a heavy water installation. The approximately 300 scientists working there on the nuclear project probably had a cyclotron at their disposal, as a part of the plant was located underground. Raw materials, uranium in particular, came from the occupied territories in Korea, China and Inner Mongolia. Shortly before the end of the war, US intelligence came across some unexpected information. Japanese scientists were apparently planning to conduct an atomic bomb test near Konan on 12 August, six days after the Hiroshima explosion. The bomb developed for the Japanese navy was possibly intended to be used by kamikaze pilots. However, this rumor could not be verified, as Konan was occupied a few days later by the Red Army. Most of the Japanese installations were subsequently destroyed. Though most experts are skeptical about a Japanese nuclear bomb test, it seems that the Japanese project was further advanced than had been assumed. After the two nuclear attacks on Japan, and the country’s subsequent unconditional surrender, the history of its atomic project\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n16\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nUranium Matters\n\nwas suppressed. Japan came to regard itself as a victim of the American raids. The scientists who had taken part in the nuclear program remained silent, or insisted they had taken part in developing atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Shortly after the war, the Japanese cyclotron was destroyed by the US Army, and the few extant documents confiscated. The Second World War had hardly ended and new conflicts were starting to emerge. The United States had little interest in publishing information regarding the nuclear achievements of the defeated powers. The post-war history of Europe, and of the world, was dominated by the conflict between two new superpowers: the United States and the Soviet Union. The conflict was driven by the arms race, especially in the field of the nuclear weapons. Stalin’s shrewdness and paranoia helped him to conceal his extensive knowledge of his Western allies’ nuclear project in Potsdam on 24 July 1945. He had received the first information on the possibilities of an atomic bomb from London as early as the autumn of 1941. The information came from John Cairncross, private secretary to Lord Hankey, a member of the cabinet responsible for overseeing the work of the intelligence services.31 It was passed on to Moscow by Anatolii Veniaminovich Gorsky (Vadim), who worked under diplomatic cover as the resident in London. Gorsky’s message was sent on 25 October 1941, and reached Moscow shortly before the celebration of the anniversary of the revolution on 7 November. Lavrentii Beria, the head of the NKVD, delivered the report to Stalin. In March l942, another reminder of the importance attributed by the British to nuclear research reached Moscow. Gorsky reported the details of the nuclear project and the role which Canada, a rich source of uranium, was to play in it. Another report from London concerned nuclear research carried out by Hahn and Heisenberg in Germany. It also referred to the Norsk Hydro plant in Rjukan, Norway, capable of supplying Germany with 4,500 kg of heavy water a year. Beria suggested that consultations with the scientists should take place. Many leading Soviet scientists were pessimistic about the practical uses of atomic energy. They noted that articles on the subject had stopped appearing in western scientific publications. A young physicist Georgi Flerov, who served as a lieutenant in Voronezh early in 1942, wrote to Stalin in April. It is not certain whether the letter reached Stalin, though it was known in the scientific community. Flerov’s letter harshly criticized, in familiar terms of Stalinist invective, the physicists who were pessimistic about the possibility of developing nuclear energy for military purposes.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n17\n\nBeria used intelligence reports from the West to acquaint Stalin and the State Committee for Defense (GOKO, the highest government office concerned with military matters) with the subject of nuclear weapons. The reports showed that research in nuclear physics was considered to have significant military applications, and that the scientific community in Germany, as well as the British and Americans, also intended to use it for military purposes. Beria intended to create a body of scientific consultants and attach it to the State Defense Committee. He named three scientists (Kapitsa, Skobeltsyn and Slutski) as having worked in the field of nuclear fission. As none of them had in fact done so, it seems that Beria was better informed on the British than the Soviet side of atomic research.32 Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov, who was then researching the problem of protecting shipping against the threat of magnetic mines, was invited to come to Moscow on l5 September l942. There he met Mikhail Georgevich Pervukhin, a party technocrat with the rank of deputy prime minister in charge of the chemical industries. Kurchatov possibly met Stalin as well. He moved to Moscow permanently in February l943, when the State Defense Committee formally established an atomic energy research program. Kurchatov’s colleague, Iulii Borisovich Khariton, thought that Kurchatov was “an exceptional leader who organized a strategically correct program from the very beginning.”33 While Beria was considering how best to use the intelligence material from London, Molotov made it available to Pervukhin. Molotov asked him to find out what Soviet scientists knew about the research carried out abroad, and their opinions about the kind of research that should be undertaken in the Soviet Union. In January 1943, Pervukhin had a meeting with Kurchatov and two of his colleagues, asking them for a memorandum concerning nuclear research. When it was finished, Pervukhin handed it over to Molotov with a warm recommendation. The State Committee for Defense passed a special resolution on the organization of nuclear research, and the laboratory of the Academy of Sciences (which later became known as Laboratory No. 2) was established. On 10 March 1943, Kurchatov was confirmed in the post of the scientific director of the project, thus becoming Robert Oppenheimer’s opposite number in the Soviet Union. After Kurchatov expressed doubts to Molotov about the feasibility of constructing the bomb in the foreseeable future, Molotov decided to pass on the intelligence materials to him. In March 1943, Kurchatov began studying these materials in his room in the Kremlin. Among the scientists, he was the only recipient of information from secret intelli-\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n18\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nUranium Matters\n\ngence sources. Though unable to disclose its origin to his colleagues, he abandoned his skepticism about the practicality of the bomb.34 In two letters to Pervukhin on 7 and 22 March l943, Kurchatov compared the work of the Soviet physicists with the intelligence he had from Molotov, wondering whether they were a true reflection of the state of research in the West. He was surprised that Western scientists preferred the diffusion to the centrifuge method of isotope separation. Kurchatov noted that the intelligence reports contained “some fragmentary comments about the possibility of using not only uranium 235 but also uranium 238.” In a letter to Pervukhin on 22 March, Kurchatov wrote that “I looked carefully through the latest research in the Physical Review on transuranic elements…and I was able to determine a new direction in the solution of the whole uranium problem…The prospects in this direction are unusually attractive.”35 Lavrentii Pavlovich Beria knew that Churchill and Roosevelt had discussed cooperating on the atomic project in Washington in June of 1942, and that the main part of the project would move to America. So far, the most valuable information had come from British sources. John Cairncross, who passed the contents of the MAUD report on the feasibility of the nuclear weapon on to the Russians, moved to Bletchley Park, where German radio traffic was deciphered, before getting a job in the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). John Philby began reporting to the Soviets early in 1944, after the establishment of a section that was to deal with “past records of Soviet and Communist activity.” Donald Maclean, a young diplomat and a Soviet spy, dealt with Anglo-American cooperation and the building of the atom bomb at the British Embassy in Washington.36 Moscow had several well-placed British sources of political intelligence at its disposal. For scientific and technical information, Klaus Fuchs was probably most valuable. After his move to North America he had his first meeting with the Soviet controller, Harry Gold, on 5 February 1944 in New York. In September 1944, Kurchatov assessed the Manhattan project as “a concentration of scientific and engineeringtechnical power on a scale never seen before in the history of world science, which has already achieved the most priceless results.”37 The secret service reported to Beria using sources from Los Alamos, apparently for the first time, as late as 28 February 1945. The report contained details of the construction of the bomb, provided by Theodore Alvin Hall, a precocious, nineteen year-old Harvard physicist. Hall was convinced that nuclear arms monopoly would continue to threaten world\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n19\n\npeace and, together with technical sergeant David Greenglass, became a useful source of intelligence on the Manhattan project. It therefore seems likely that the Russians had two sets of instructions on how to make the bomb before them: Hall may have revealed the implosion method before more detailed instructions came from Klaus Fuchs.38 When Stalin returned from Potsdam in August, he asked Kurchatov to come and see him. Stalin was impressed with the American achievement, and dissatisfied with Soviet physicists. Kurchatov tried to explain why the Soviet program had made so little progress: many people had died, equipment was destroyed, the country faced famine, and nothing was available. Kurchatov did not say that, during the war, Stalin had hedged his bets as far as the nuclear project was concerned. By the end of l944, it employed about a hundred scientists. After the explosions of the US atomic weapons in the summer of l945, Stalin knew that the power of the Soviet Union and its victory in the war would be called in question. He told Kurchatov that he wanted to know what the scientists needed, and that they would lack for nothing in the future. The Russian people were again compelled to make huge sacrifice. In the midst of post-war devastation and shortages, Stalin began laying down the foundations of the Soviet military–industrial complex.\n\nUranium Monopoly and the Division of Europe In the race for the nuclear weapon, availability of uranium ore was of the essence. General Groves tried to secure a monopoly over the purchase and processing of uranium by all available means. On 3 December 1945, Groves confidently reported to the Secretary of War that the Combined Development Trust, a joint British-American government agency, controlled by Groves himself, had cornered 97% of the world’s production of uranium, and 65% of thorium.39 Sometime in February 1945, Groves recommended to General Marshall that the Auer uranium processing plant near Oranienburg be destroyed by air attack.40 The role of the Auer Gesellschaft in the supply of uranium was confirmed independently by information from Brussels and from Paris. Auer had taken over the management of a formerly Jewish company in Paris, which traded in rare metals, and thorium in particular. Dr. Egon Ihwe, who looked after this side of the Auer business, had supplied Alsos with the information. By the end of 1944, Groves knew of the central importance of the Oranienburg processing plant. For a long\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n20\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nUranium Matters\n\ntime, his memoirs remained the only source on the true purpose of the heavy air raid on 15 March 1945.41 The Auer Gesellschaft plant was not among the targets originally selected for the Eighth US Air Force, which carried out the raid. Instead, the SS Main Ordnance and the Heinkel aircraft plant and airfield were to be targeted. The Auer processing plant was not mentioned in any existing documents or literature, though the neighboring railway junction was. The only mention of the air raid on the Auer plant comes from a report dated 16 March: “The industrial area just West of the target [i.e. the SS depot], including the gas mask factory of [there is an empty space in the report] AUERGESELLSCHAFT AG recieved [sic] many hits, causing at least two explosions and starting numerous fires.”42 Among the target dossiers of the US Strategic Bombing Survey, there exists a report on the raid where this gap in the text is filled in, by hand, with “GS-5451,” the code for the Auer plant. The sentence quoted above is also underlined by hand. It may be assumed that these unusual additions, made in only one of the 243 copies of the report distributed in the offices of the US Air Force, were made by somebody who had special interest in the work of the Auer Company. It was described in the report as a maker of “gas-masks, anti-gas equipment for submarines and air filters.” The Americans and the British selected targets on the basis of a detailed list of German industrial plants, including the Auer Company. Its description as a producer of gas masks is hardly plausible. The operational order named the Mean Points of Impact—that is, places where the bombs were to be concentrated. One was in the middle of the railway station, the second on the rails of the south-eastern exit. This was where the Auer plant was situated, on both sides of the railway lines. The plant therefore lay at the centre of the massive air raid, which was conducted by the Eighth Air Force. 612 aircrafts took part in the raid, and the composition of the strike force was significant: every bomber flight was to include one plane with delayed fuse bombs. The delays were 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours, in order to hinder salvage efforts. The order for the operation came in late. The Eighth Air Force had planned for routine raids on synthetic fuel plants in the area of Leipzig and Ruhland on 15 March. A high priority order then arrived from the United States Strategic Air Force, giving the composition and tactics of the strike force and moving the target to the area of Berlin.43 The command of the Eighth Air Force was thus transferred from General James H. Doolittle to the supreme commander of the US Air Force, General\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n21\n\nCarl Spaatz. All this tallies with the report on the raid as told in General Groves’ autobiography. About three weeks after the raid, the Auer Company asked Reich authorities for compensation for the damage caused by the raid. On the basis of accounts from June 1944, the total cost of the damage was put at 61 million RM.44 A few days later, the Red Army reached the town. A Soviet commission of experts started inspecting the plant on 21 April 1945. Ihwe, the manager, was questioned. All documentation and patents had to be handed over to the commission. All usable equipment was stripped and sent to the Soviet Union, as well as the available rare metals. When Nikolaus Riehl, the German physicist, visited the Oranienburg processing plant, he realized that “The Russians who accompanied me appreciated that the bombings were directed not against the Germans but against them.”45 When some of the uranium the Germans had initially impounded in Belgium was located at Stassfurt, deep within the Soviet zone, the Alsos advanced there regardless and impounded some 1,100 tons of ore. Until the spring of 1945, the Allies had been united in their desire to bring the war to an early end, though often divided on how to best achieve this. The European Advisory Commission (EAC) was a backroom team proposed by Eden and established by the Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow in October l943. Based in London, it played the key role in drawing up zones of occupation in Germany, and kept the lines of communication open on matters of strategy between American, British and Soviet military commands. Preliminary work concerning the division of Germany into zones of occupation was done in connection with the preparations for the Second Front. General J. H. Morgan and his staff worked under the assumption that the Americans, whose bases were located in the western part of Britain, would go through France and Belgium to occupy south Germany, including Bavaria, while British forces would liberate Holland and move to the Ruhr and northwestern Germany. The Russians were to take the East, and Berlin was to come under joint control of the Allies. A committee of the British cabinet, chaired by Clement Attlee, confirmed the division and drew up the western border of the Russian zone.46 This was late in the summer of l943, and the boundary proposed in London eventually became the eastern border of the Federal Republic of Germany. It put 40% of German territory and 36% of the population on the other side of the boundary, under Soviet control. The EAC final protocol on the zones of occupation was signed 12 September 1944, and confirmed by the Big Three at the conference at\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n22\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nUranium Matters\n\nYalta in February 1945. It was a contract on the limits of advance of the Allied armies in Germany. It assumed momentous political significance later, by dividing Germany—and Europe— into two spheres of influence. Starting in March of 1945, as American and British troops advanced fast into the center of Germany and the Red Army was approaching Berlin, Churchill became increasingly concerned by Stalin’s policy in Eastern Europe. The future of Poland worried him, as did the reports of British officers on Allied Control Commissions in the countries under Soviet occupation. He wanted the western commanders to move as far east as they could, in disregard of the zonal protocol. Due to the speed of its eastward advance, the US Army moved into the “tactical zones” to the north of the Erzgebirge, and occupied large parts of Saxony and Thuringia, a region well beyond the zonal limit. Two days after Hitler’s last birthday, on 22 April l945, the US Seventh and the French First Army crossed the Danube. Augsburg and Munich fell to the Seventh Army on 30 April, and some 30,000 prisoners in the Dachau concentration camp were set free. In the north, British and American armies established bridgeheads across the river Elbe, while the Russians fought their way through the streets of Berlin. Hitler was by then dead or dying, and Field Marshal Keitel admitted that there was no way of relieving Berlin. The armies were everywhere on the move, and the fluid nature of warfare prompted Eisenhower, also on 30 April, to telegraph his strategic intentions to Moscow. He suggested that, in the north, his approximate aim was to reach the line Wismar-Schwerin-Domitz, while in the center he would hold his position along the Elbe and Mulde rivers. Concerning Czechoslovak territory, Eisenhower proposed to pause at the l937 border before advancing, should the situation require this, to a line between Karlovy Vary–Plzenˇ and Cˇeské Budeˇjovice. Eisenhower assumed that the Red Army would clear the country up to the Elbe and Moldau (Vltava) rivers. He added that “with knowledge of our mutual plans adjustments of contacts in this area” would be made by local commanders.47 On 4 May, one of Patton’s armored units was about to run into the Russians in the Linz region. In the evening, General Bradley telephoned Patton to give him the green light for an advance to Czechoslovakia. There were eighteen divisions in Patton’s army, comprised of some 540,000 men. He wanted to be through the mountain passes as soon as possible, “before anything hit us.” The advance began in the morning on 5 May: “In view of the radio reports that the Czechoslovakian citizens\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n23\n\nhad taken Prague, I was very anxious to go and assist them, and asked Bradley for authority to do so, but this was denied. As a matter of fact, however, reconnaissance elements of the Third Army were in the vicinity of Prague and by that act marked the furthest progress to the East of any western army.” On 6 May, Patton received confirmation of the ruling that his troops were not to advance beyond the stop line running through Pilsen for distances greater than required for security reconnaissance. “I was very much chagrined because I felt, and still feel, that we should have gone on to Moldau River and, if the Russians did not like it, let them go to hell.”48 The Karlovy Vary–Jáchymov region lay within the area of operations of the Vth Corps of Patton’s Third Army. It was commanded by General Huebner, who ordered his infantry and armored units to attack Karlovy Vary. The main road between Karlovy Vary, Sokolov and Kynsˇ perk was defended by the German Kampfgruppe Benicke. After some skirmishes, the Americans reached the line Kraslice-Jindrˇichovice—Horní Slavkov on 7 May. The Red Army got there four days later, on 11 May: the contact line with the Americans stabilized during the summer. It ran roughly from Sachsenberg in Germany across Rotava, Jindrˇichovice, Dolní Niva, Vintírˇov to Doubí, and from there to Teplicˇka and Becˇov.49 Czechoslovakia was an allied country, and both the Red Army and the US Army were expected to withdraw soon. No zones of occupation had been agreed upon for Czechoslovakia. In the meanwhile, developments in Germany were more blurred. In the spring of 1945, Churchill left Washington, a dark vision of the future of Soviet-dominated Europe fixed in his mind. The controversy about the withdrawal of the US Army to the agreed contact lines culminated early in May. Churchill warned Eden that the retreat of the American army would be one of the most distressing events of world history. The Americans were unimpressed by Churchill’s fears, as they did not want to risk a breakdown of the Allied occupation policy. Without withdrawal from the territory which was to be a part of the Russian zone of occupation, the future of the Allied Control Commission was threatened, as well as the control of Berlin by the four Powers. On 11 June 1945 President Truman cabled London that the agreement on the zones should be adhered to, and the British and the American troops withdrew from parts of Mecklenburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia and Saxony. The Americans also agreed that the Red Army should establish its headquarters at Karlovy Vary. The territories vacated by the Americans soon proved to be the richest source of uranium for Stalin’s atomic bomb.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n24\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nUranium Matters\n\nThe brief occupation by the Americans of parts of the future Soviet zone gave rise to speculation. Why did the Americans withdraw and enable the Russians to access the richest sources of uranium in Europe? Did the promise of uranium play any role at this time, when Germany was divided into the zones of occupation? Did the Americans miss a historical chance when they withdrew from the line of their furthest advance to the East? In Stefan Heym’s 1984 novel Schwarzenberg, the answer was put simply: “When I imagine, how differently the history of the republic would have unfolded had the Americans known what was hidden under the soil of Schwarzenberg! They could have known it as did the miners, who mined silver and tin in the region in the old times and who struck pitchblende again and again. And were not the radioactive springs in the vicinity a further proof?”50 The idea of a missed historical chance was recycled in contemporary publicity.51 There exists no evidence that the uranium problem played any role in the negotiations on the division of Germany into zones of occupation. The negotiations took place at a time when Stalin was pessimistic about the atomic project, and the whole venture, including the search for uranium, did not enjoy a priority status. The uranium reserves in Thuringia, Saxony and Bohemia played no role in Churchill’s correspondence during the spring of 1945, with its insistence on retaining the territories under British and American occupation. At that time, neither he nor Truman were aware of the uranium reserves there.52 There nevertheless exists a sharp contrast between the decision of the Americans to withdraw from Saxony, Thuringia and Bohemia on the one hand and, on the other, the decision to bomb the Auer company plant in Oranienburg. Both decisions were made within a period of three months. While General Groves knew enough about the German atomic project to try and reduce Soviet war booty, he was less well informed about the Erzgebirge. He knew only of the oldest, low yield European uranium mines at Jáchymov. Early in the summer of 1945, the Russians moved into the region vacated by the Americans. They were not aware that, by the time mining was concluded there after 1989, it would produce over 231,000 tons of uranium.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n25\n\nThe Erzgebirge and the Soviet Uranium Gap Some months before the end of the war, the NKVD began preparing itself for the search for German nuclear scientists and their technical equipment. Avramii P. Zaveniagin, Colonel General in NKVD and a mining engineer, became the head of the project. He had managed Magnitogorsk, a metallurgical concern, and the Norilsk mining company. In 1937, he became deputy minister of heavy industry. Zaveniagin became Beria’s deputy in 1941, and in the spring of 1945 he began to look after security of the Soviet atomic project. He was described as the “Soviet General Groves.”53 The position of the Soviet nuclear project and Zaveniagin’s role in it were further strengthened on 20 August 1945, when Stalin ordered the establishment of a special section of the State Committee on Defense,54 inviting Beria to be its head. According to a member of the team of nuclear scientists, the departments under Beria’s command worked with the precision of a Swiss watch.55 Of all the Soviet government agencies, the NKVD alone was capable of securing priority allocation of the resources for the project to build the bomb. The Soviets were initially more interested in tracing the German atomic program and recruiting German scientists than in the search for uranium.56 Despite strong opposition from the Communist Party bureaucrats, Zaveniagin sent a group of forty Soviet physicists to Germany.57 They succeeded in convincing eminent German scientists, including Manfred von Ardenne, Gustav Hertz, Heinz Pose, Nikolaus Riehl, Peter Adolf Thiessen and Max Volmer, to work for the Soviet atomic program. As early as 15 May 1945, NKVD presented in Moscow the results of their investigations into the German plants and research institutes which concerned themselves with nuclear matters.58 Among the institutions visited were the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, Manfred von Ardenne’s institute in Berlin-Lichterfelde, Institut der Reichspostforschungsanstalt in Zeuthen (Miersdorf), the Siemens cyclotron laboratory run by Gustav Hertz, as well as the plants and warehouses of the Auer company in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Berlin-Grunau, Oranienburg and Zechlin. The objects came under NKVD control and were soon dismantled. Special units found about 300 tons of uranium oxide and 7 tons of uranium metal in Berlin, Gottow, Zechlin, Kagar and Rheinsberg.59 In Stadtilm, a small town in Thuringia, the special unit found a uranium processing plant that used to belong to the Degussa Company.60 The Auer Company’s plant in Oranienburg, destroyed in the American air\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n26\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nUranium Matters\n\nraid in March 1945, was also thoroughly searched; a few tons of pure uranium oxide and several hundred tons of thorium derivates were found there. According to western estimates, about half of the scientific work on the “uranium problem” in the Soviet Union was carried out in prison laboratories.61 In addition, prisoners in the gulag system carried out most of the construction and mining work for the atomic project. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who mapped Stalin’s Gulag Archipelago in great detail, made only a brief reference to the camps that contributed to the nuclear project. Prisoners in the top-secret camps had to make special pledges of non-disclosure. According to Solzhenitsyn, these pledges were renewed every three months. When the initial phase of the work on the atomgrady (atomic cities) was completed, a large group of the workers were sent to Kolyma in September 1950, as a “particularly dangerous special contingent.” 62 Next to the gulag archipelago, there grew up the “white” archipelago of the nuclear enterprise. Professor Lev Altschuler spent twenty-two years as its employee: “The white archipelago became the centre of thousands of highly qualified scientists, engineers, construction and production workers and many others, who had survived the war and persecution.” They were completely isolated from the outside world: “My future workplace was miles away from the nearest railway station. We were transported in buses, wrapped into long fur coats. We passed through settlements which looked like Russia before Peter the Great. When we arrived, we saw monastery churches and houses, cottages scattered in the forest, and the common symbols of this era, the “zones”…[they were] camps inhabited by prisoners from every region of the Soviet Union and of every nationality. According to local people…a large number of prisoners had recently rioted and escaped into the forest. The rebellion was led by an army pilot. Every morning, columns of convicts marched through our village. Such was the stark reality.” 63 Parallel with the development of the nuclear program itself, Beria’s agencies tried to secure sufficient supplies of uranium. Russian geologists estimated Soviet uranium reserves at about 2,000 tons, concentrated mainly in central Asia.64 Its location meant that it could hardly become the basis of an efficient uranium industry. In the last months of the war, the NKVD therefore began exploring the possibilities of acquiring uranium abroad. Behind the advancing Red Army, and among the special units engaged in the search for scientific and technological booty of every kind, groups of geologists were to be found.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n27\n\nThe first group came to Bulgaria at the end of November 1944. It followed a German trace: Soviet troops had discovered some German documents concerning uranium reserves in the vicinity of the town of Buchovo. The first report was sent to Beria on 12 January 1945, who informed the former leader of the communist International, Georgi Dimitrov, of the Soviet’s interest.65 In October, a Soviet-Bulgarian mining company was established, and Soviet geologists came to Buchovo. Political prisoners were employed in the uranium mines and, by the middle of 1946, the company had produced 272 tons of pitchblende, which was then sent to the Soviet Union.66 Dimitrov took a keen personal interest in the project. The Soviet director of the enterprise nevertheless did not inform Dimitrov about the quality of the Buchovo pitchblende. The volume of production was also kept a Soviet state secret.67 After Bulgaria, the NKVD turned to Czechoslovakia. At the end of August 1945, an expedition was sent to Jáchymov, including Semion P. Alexandrov and Alexander Orlov, two experts who had taken part in the search at Buchovo. Beria’s special committee for the atomic bomb received the first report on Jáchymov on 14 September 1945. The estimated uranium reserves in Jáchymov amounted to 300 tons.68 It was, however, in the German side of the Erzgebirge in the Soviet zone of occupation, which would eventually become the most important source of uranium for Beria’s project. The Jáchymov mines were not considered to be a rich source of highgrade ore, but the dearth of uranium in the Soviet Union nourished the hopes of new finds; and the Jáchymov trace led the Russians to neighboring Saxony. In May 1945, after Soviet specialists interrogated the geologists in Freiberg, they decided to carry out the necessary exploration themselves.69 Early in August 1945, an expedition of Soviet geologists, led by Professor Kreiter, came to Saxony.70 The geologists visited the headquarters of the Sachsenerz-Bergwerks AG in Freiberg and the mines near Schneeberg and Johanngeorgenstadt. In Freiberg, they consulted geological maps of the former silver fields, as well as the documents of the mining administration. Johannes Schmidt, who as chief supervisor (Obersteiger) knew his way around the mines better than anyone else, pointed out the old works where explorations could be started. Sometime in August 1945, the Russians decided to undertake thorough explorations in Saxony. The geologists, led by Semion P. Alexandrov began with a review of the old mines in September. They pretended to the Germans that they were looking for bismuth and cobalt.71 Profes-\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n28\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 28\n\nUranium Matters\n\nsor Friedrich Schumacher, director of the geological institute at the mining academy in Freiberg, was probably the first German who found out, during a conversation with Professor Kreiter on 10 September 1945, the true purpose of the search in Saxony. Schumacher agreed with Kreiter to establish an “office for colored metals,” which was to carry out commissions for the occupying authority. Together with Professor Gustav Aeckerlein, who had studied the sources of radioactive waters in Saxony, Schumacher was asked to help with the examination of the reserves of uranium.72 Their first report was ready on 8 October,73 and it estimated the prospects for uranium mining as being generally poor. They thought that Johanngeorgenstadt, in close proximity to Jáchymov, was more promising than Schneeberg. After Taking into consideration the amount of ore necessary to produce the volume of oxide, Schumacher forecast a “possible reserve” of 80 to 90 tons of uranium oxide there. It was ten times the amount of uranium produced in Johanngeorgenstadt to date.74 In view of Soviet interest in uranium and of the uncertain post-war situation, it may be assumed that the German professors were trying to ensure a continued existence for their academy, and possibly even a new future for it in the uranium industry. Although their skepticism regarding the economic feasibility of uranium mining remained unchanged, Schumacher went on working, during 1946, on estimates of the reserves in Johanngeorgenstadt and Marienberg. The first Russian estimates were even more pessimistic. At the end of 1945, Alexandrov put the Schneeberg reserves at 10 tons and Johanngeorgenstadt at 22 tons.75 In the spring of 1946, Alexandrov sent a report to Moscow recommending that, despite the low estimates, mining works be started at Johanngeorgenstadt. In the meanwhile, Professor Aeckerlein was commissioned by the Russians to build or acquire the instruments necessary for locating and measuring uranium deposits. He made an emanations meter and then turned to producers in the British zone, where he acquired Geiger counters and other instruments. The two Freiberg professors did not work for the Russians long. In the course of denazification, Schumacher was suspended as the head of the office for colored metals in November 1946. He moved to Jugoslavia in the spring 1947, where he worked, until 1950, as chief geologist for a lead and zinc mining enterprise. In 1952, Schumacher started to work for the mineralogical institute at the University of Bonn. The value of his work for the Soviets lay primarily in his estimates, which were more optimistic than those initially presented by the Russian geologists. Due\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 29\n\nPart 1: Unparalleled Power\n\n29\n\nto the Allied ban on Germans working in the field of atomic physics, Aeckerlein’s radium institute was closed down in the spring of 1948. The NKVD officers hoped that enquiries among the members of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Oberschlema would give them some leads. Since 1937, Professor Boris Rajewsky and his colleagues at the KaiserWilhelm-Institut für Biophysik at Frankfurt am Main had been making examinations of radon content in the air and the waters of the mines at Schneeberg and, later, in Jáchymov.76 Dr. Adolf Krebs, the head of the Oberschlema branch of the Rajewsky’s institute, was arrested by NKVD officers on 1 October 1945. Before being taken to Moscow, he was interrogated in Dresden and Berlin.77 He was allowed to return to Germany in the spring 1946, from where he immigrated to the United States. In a report drafted early in 1948, Krebs reinforced the low estimates, current in America at the time, of the potential of the Erzgebirge region. In June 1946, the council of ministers of the USSR gave the go-ahead to uranium mining in Saxony,78 although prospects were still uncertain. Another search party under N. M. Khaustov established, about the same time, the existence of deposits near Oberschlema.79 The existence of strong radioactive waters, as well as the evidence gathered by the KaiserWilhelm-Institut, helped the Soviets make the decision to start mining operations at Oberschlema. The town had a well-known spa, which was closed down after the war. In July 1946, the occupation authorities allowed resumption of its service, which was once again suspended only a few weeks later.80 Geological probes were made in the vicinity of the spa buildings, and large parts of the spa quarter and the famous springs fell victim to the search for uranium. The local people regarded the destruction of the spa as the beginning of a new “mining fever.” From the end of 1946, Soviet estimates of the uranium reserves in the German part of the Erzgebirge kept on going up. Whereas reserves of about 100 tons were assumed at the end of 1945, by January 1947 the estimate of proven reserves increased to 252 tons. While Dr. Krebs was drafting, early in 1948, his report on the poor reserves available to the Soviets in their zone of occupation, the estimates reached the figure of 1,600 tons.81 The Soviet authorities by then knew that Saxony could provide more uranium than any other part of their empire.\n\nZeman 1\n\n31/1/08\n\n30\n\n3:38 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nUranium Matters\n\nNotes Bibliographical note: There exists extensive historiography concerning the American and the British nuclear programs, including official histories.

An impenetrable mountain forest, the Erzgebirge became one of the most densely populated regions in Europe. According to legend, carters from the Harz Mountains found traces of lead on the wheels of their wagons when they passed through the site of present-day Freiberg. The news of the discovery of metal ore reached Siegerland, a rich source of iron in North-Rhine Westphalia, and its miners laid the foundations for the industry early in the 12th century. So, at any rate, goes the legend. The first three pits, sunk where the town hall now stands, yielded silver ore of high quality. Freiberg became a free mining town in 1218, flourishing during the reign of Margrave Henry the Enlightened (Heinrich der Erleuchtete). The Freiberg mining laws were enacted in 1296, becoming the basis for mining regulation in all Saxon towns and elsewhere in the mining regions of Europe. The local mining school (Bergakademie) became the first institution of its kind in the world. The initial period of silver mining, lasting from the 12th to the13th century, was followed by intensive tin mining during the 14th and 15th centuries. Tin mining began in Graupen (Krupka), Bohemia circa 1230, and a century later in the region of Neustadt. This extensive mining challenged the English tin monopoly.1 In addition to tin, bismuth was also mined, and another silver rush began in 1470.2 “Much commotion in the mountains” (das große Berggeschrei) was set off, as the news of the discoveries spread and drew many miners and their families to the Erzgebirge. New towns were founded in quick succession: Schneeberg in 1471, Annaberg in 1497, Sankt Joachimsthal 1520 and Marienberg in 1521. Their growth reflected faith in the future of the mining industry. There was little agriculture in the mountains and food supplies had to be brought from afar. The situation lasted until the 20th century, accounting for cyclical crises during the mining recessions. Schneeberg became a free mining town in 1481. New discoveries of silver helped the town, and the ruler of Saxony (Kurfürst), achieve uncommon riches. Frederick the Wise referred to the town as “little Venice.” There were iron and copper mines and smelting plants in a nearby valley at Schlema, and silver was mined in Niederschlema. People in the neighboring town of Zwickau benefited from their connection with the industry, as miners or workers in a variety of service industries. In the 20th\n\nZeman 2\n\n31/1/08\n\n38\n\n3:39 PM\n\nPage 38\n\nUranium Matters\n\ncentury, strong radioactive springs were discovered at Oberschlema, contributing to a flourishing spa enterprise. There existed in the region the famous “Markus Semmler Stolln,” a water conduit for the Schneeberg and Schlema pits. It was laid down in 1503, reaching the length of 44 kilometers in the 19th century. The danger of flooding increased as excavations went deeper. Flooding affected the Schneeberg pits on a large scale at least three times, in 1470, 1491 and 1511. Every time, the miners succeeded in bringing production back on stream, but the center of mining moved elsewhere, to Annaberg and Sankt Joachimsthal, or Jáchymov in Czech. Prosperity spread from the Schneeberg district to the village Aue, which became a town in 1626. Aue specialized in the mining and processing of tin, a product that enjoyed a high reputation at the time. In two settlements nearby, Auerhammer and Niederpfannenstiel, sheet metal and blue dyes were made, and the locality became a well-known metalprocessing center. After 1945, the town became the administrative center of the uranium industry. Annaberg became a free mining town in 1497 and, until the middle of the 16th century, it grew faster than any other town in Saxony. Home to about 12,000 inhabitants in 1540, it was the second largest town in the Erzgebirge after Freiberg.3 Silver mining was the first business in the Erzgebirge that paid wages, giving the miners a freedom rarely enjoyed by other workers. Hard work and its dangers created strong bonds in the mining community, leading to the establishment of its first benevolent organizations. Apart from the welfare function miners’ guilds performed—supporting those members who had fallen on hard times—they played an important role in improving the living and working conditions of the miners. Guilds helped with projects such as the establishment of health commissions and the building of accommodation for the miners. The silver boom ended about 1570, when silver imports from the new world diminished the value of the Erzgebirge silver. The towns lost their prosperity and many of their inhabitants. The decline of the region reached its nadir between 1618 and 1648, during the Thirty Years War. Silver mining in the Erzgebirge revived about 1660, when new finds were made in the neighborhood of Johanngeorgenstadt. The town was founded by Protestant refugees from Bohemia who had come under the rule of the Catholic Habsburgs. Protestant families from the mining towns of Platten, Gottesgab and St. Joachimsthal crossed the border to Saxony. In February 1654, the ruler of Saxony, Kurfürst Johann Georg I,\n\nZeman 2\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:39 PM\n\nPage 39\n\nPart 2: The Erzgebirge Region\n\n39\n\ngave them permission to found a town and give it his name.4 In addition to silver, cobalt, iron, tin and sulphur were also mined there. The town had a special connection with cobalt, which was used for the production of blue dyes (Blaufarben); the skill first came to Saxony from Platten and Joachimsthal in Bohemia at the beginning of the 17th century. Workshops were established at Johanngeorgenstadt, Schneeberg and later at Oberschlema. The rulers of Saxony were aware of the importance of the dyes for export. Under the threat of capital punishment, they forbid the export of cobalt ore in 1683.5 By the middle of the 18th century, mining at Johanngeorgenstadt was in a severe crisis, and had to be supported by state subsidies. In 1838, seven profitable pits formed a union under the name “Vereinigt Feld am Fastenberg.” They produced silver, bismuth and uranium. As metal prices declined in the 19th century, the profitability of Freiberg’s mining was affected: nationalized in 1886, they were kept alive by subsidies. After 1908 two state mines, “Himmelfahrt” and “Himmelfürst,” as well as a trade union mine, were still operating. The state mines were closed down shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. At the beginning of 20th century, some cobalt, wolfram, tin and nickel were still mined in the area. Sankt Joachimsthal was an important part of the mining region on the border between Saxony and Bohemia which shared a common past. The valley of St. Joachim is situated in a fold of the Erzgebirge mountains, or Krusˇné hory in Czech. The German name of the mountain range refers to its abundance of ores; the Czech to the harshness of the region’s climate. It formed the border between Saxony, in the East Franconian march, and the Kingdom of Bohemia. A trade route led through the forest from Annaberg to a valley on the Bohemian side, where a settlement called Konradsgrün came into being. Emperor Sigismund gave the Konradsgrün estate as a fief to his chancellor, Caspar Count Schlick, in 1437. After the flooding of the mines at nearby Schneeberg in Saxony, the search for silver was carried over to the Bohemian side of Erzgebirge in 1511. In the following year, two experienced miners began to sink a shaft at Konradsgrün but soon ran out of money. Further excavations were financed by Stephan Count Schlick, together with a few neighboring nobles. They founded a mining company and hired miners, who struck rich veins of silver. The news spread fast and attracted more workers, most of them from Saxony. The stream of migrants was described in verse: “Ins Thal, ins Thal, mit Muttern, mit All.” (Into the valley, the valley, with mothers and all.”)\n\nZeman 2\n\n31/1/08\n\n40\n\n3:39 PM\n\nPage 40\n\nUranium Matters\n\nKonradsgrün was home to 400 houses in 1516. The Schlicks completed the Freudenstein fortress, built to protect the mining town from plunder and remind the miners who their master was, the following year. Unrest broke out in 1517. On 2 August 1518, a mining statute based on the statute of Annaberg and containing 106 articles, was published. On 6 January 1520, Konradsgrün became a royal town by decree. Its name was changed to Sankt Joachimsthal, or the valley of St. Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary. Most of the immigrants were miners from neighboring Saxony, coming from Annaberg, Marienberg and Josefsstadt: Joachimsthal was added to keep the holy family together. The town was awarded a coat of arms and the right to choose its own local government. Despite the royal ban on the export of silver (dating from the year 1300, early in the first silver rush in Bohemia), a part of Joachimsthal silver was sold to the great merchant house in Germany, the Fuggers in Augsburg and the Welsers in Nürnberg. Count Schlick, concerned about the loss of revenue, successfully negotiated with the Bohemian Diet the right to mint coins. In 1519, the first Joachimsthaler was issued from the cellars of the Freudenstein fortress. With a silver content of 931 out of 1000, the coin became common currency throughout Europe. It was also well known in the New World, as the derivation of the word “dollar” from “thaler” shows. Over 3 million thalers were minted between 1520 and 1528. With 18,200 inhabitants, St. Joachimsthal had become, after Prague, the most populous city in the kingdom by 1532. Silver production had reached its peak: 134 silver veins were mined by some 8,000 miners and 800 supervisors. Some of the veins were uncommonly rich: a single mine in a quarter of the year 1524, for instance, yielded as much as 1.6 tons of silver. Total production between the years of 1516 and 1600 was put at 330–350 tons.6 The ore was processed in 13 large smelters, which filled the valley with poisonous fumes. The mining town became unbearably crowded, with 10–15 people living in each house. The miners brought the ore to the surface in sacks, from long, unventilated galleries (stretching 11.5 kilometers in Barbora in 1589) and shafts with climbing ladders. Floods, famine and plague were common in Joachimsthal. Though the silver boom was comparatively short—by 1574, the number of inhabitants in the valley of St Joachim had fallen to some 4,000 individuals—the town acquired several handsome buildings. The chapel of All Souls, the oldest surviving building near the cemetery, was completed in 1516, the brewery in 1518 and the old town hall in 1520.\n\nZeman 2\n\n31/1/08\n\n3:39 PM\n\nPage 41\n\nPart 2: The Erzgebirge Region\n\n41\n\nThe Bread Market formed the centre of Joachimsthal before the business of the town moved a few hundred meters further up the valley. The new town hall was completed, in the renaissance style, around the year 1531. The royal mint was opened in 1536, the church of St. Joachim close by was built between the years 1534 and 1540, and a Latin school with an outstanding library came into existence. Johannes Agricola (Bauer), who wrote a treatise on mining and was fascinated by the healing powers of minerals, was the local physician. Traces of the original mines in the forests around the town still exist, as do mounds of soil running through the woods, left in the wake of the miners as they followed the veins of silver. The seams were gradually exhausted, and the mines abandoned. The Thirty Years War began to ravage central Europe, confirming the dividing line between Catholic Bohemia and Protestant Saxony. Joachimsthal suffered the final blow when the royal mint was established in Prague in 1670. Intermittent and unsuccessful attempts, usually sponsored by the state, were made to revive the mining of silver during the 18th century. The great mining towns of the Erzgebirge never regained their former prosperity. In 19th century Joachimsthal, the endeavor to expand traditional crochet work was overtaken by the glove industry, a factory for the production of bottle corks was constructed, and then a paper mill. The new enterprises were joined by a tobacco factory in the 1860s, and then by a puppet factory, run by the Samuel brothers. About the same time, glassmakers and potters in Bohemia started using uranium-based dyes, which added special luster to yellow, green and orange colors. The price of uranium went up, and some of the old pits were saved as mining activities were resumed. Between 1854 and 1860 some 7.4 tons of uranium were produced in Joachimsthal. In the following decades leading up to 1910, production increased from 38.1 to 39.9 tons, and then 44.5, 53.7 and 104.4 tons. It declined to 50.1 tons between 1911 and 1920, picking up again in 1921 and 1930, reaching 154.2 tons before declining again to 130.4 tons between 1930 and 1938. More than 621 tons were produced overall.7 Uranium-related trade became so brisk that a railway branch line was built between Joachimsthal and Ostrov nad Ohrˇí in 1896. Uranium was used for the production of dyes at Schneeberg and Johanngeorgenstadt as well. Uranium paint factories were founded in Johanngeorgenstadt and later at Oberschlema. On the Bohemian and Saxon side of the Erzgebirge region, there also existed local spa industries based on the belief in the healing property of radioactive waters. On the German side, the springs at Ronnenburg in\n\nZeman 2\n\n31/1/08\n\n42\n\n3:39 PM\n\nPage 42\n\nUranium Matters\n\nThuringia were the first to acquire reputation for their healing properties. Duke Frederick III of Saxe-Gotha, who suffered from gout, spent a considerable part of the year there. Ronnenburg lost its "
