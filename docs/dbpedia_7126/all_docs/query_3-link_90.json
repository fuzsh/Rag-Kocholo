        "text": "This paper is about the trade of copper originating from the Harz Mountains or, more specifically, from Goslar, and concentrates on the period between the 12 th and 14 th centuries. The Harz Mountains can be regarded as the largest and most important copper source of medieval Central Europe until the rise of copper production in Falun in the 14 th century, and mining historians have shown that the trade of metallic products from the Harz was well established by the 12 th century. The recent study of Huneberg has provided a model for the production capacity of a typical 12 th century woodland smelting site producing copper and lead in one of medieval Europe's foremost mining areas. Historians have documented the extent of metal production and trade in Goslar, an important source for raw materials that could be transported up the Rhine to market towns like Cologne and to the Meuse valley, important centres for the production of copper alloy goods. Combining our understanding of the histories of trade and mining allows an approximation to be made of the production volume of the Harz per year for the medieval period. These estimations tally quite well with the demand for copper known to us from written sources, such as the copper roof of the cathedral of Goslar from 1050 or the copper order for the Bamberg cathedral's roof by Bishop Otto in 1128.\n\nExcavations at a Medieval mining settlement in north-west Germany produced a series of metallurgy-related finds, including ore, slag, lead bullion and silver coins. These were analysed by various methods to establish their relationship to one another, in order to reconstruct the lead smelting process. The mineralogical analysis of ores and slags, and particularly of inclusions of matte, speiss and metal trapped in the slag, led to an estimate of roasting and smelting conditions. The analysis of lead isotope ratios of several of the finds further revealed two distinct strands of smelting, indicating the treatment of silver-rich ores separately from the bulk lead ore. This evidence underpins current historic research on the organisation of medieval metal mining and extraction in Central Europe in general, and illustrates the benefits of interdisciplinary research integrating archaeological, scientific and historical approaches alike.\n\nThe trade of silver in Viking Age Scandinavia is intertwined with the development and collapse of long distance trade routes stretching as far as the North Atlantic in the west to Central Asia in the east. Hedeby, a Viking emporium, was an important gateway of trade between the Baltic and North Seas, and this makes it is an ideal place to explore the evolution of the silver supply in the 10th and 11th centuries A.D. The elemental and lead isotope compositions of locally minted Hedeby coins were compared to jewelry objects, hacksilver and imported silver coins, and four chronologically related groups could be identified that reflect changes in the origin and type of raw materials used. This study features the use of laser ablation mass spectrometry of ca. 200 silver objects, and these analyses are placed in a broader context of early medieval silver metallurgy, mining archaeology and numismatics to interpret the compositional shifts as shifts in trade. Additionally, studies on crucibles and lead-based finds from Hedeby were carried out as well as the analysis of ore and slag from Central Asia to explore recycling and silver production technologies during the Viking period."
