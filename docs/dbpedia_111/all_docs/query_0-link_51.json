For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA. For the distinction between [ ], / / and ⟨ ⟩, see IPA § Brackets and transcription delimiters.\n\nThe Arabic alphabet (Arabic: الْأَبْجَدِيَّة الْعَرَبِيَّة, al-ʾabǧadiyyah l-ʿarabiyyah [æl.ʔæb.d͡ʒæˈdɪj.jæ l.ʕɑ.rɑˈbɪj.jæ] or الْحُرُوف الْعَرَبِيَّة, al-ḥurūf al-ʿarabiyyah), or Arabic abjad, is the Arabic script as specifically codified for writing the Arabic language. It is written from right-to-left in a cursive style, and includes 28 letters, of which most have contextual letterforms. The Arabic alphabet is considered an abjad, with only consonants required to be written; due to its optional use of diacritics to notate vowels, it is considered an impure abjad.[2]\n\nLetters\n\n[edit]\n\nThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters. Forms using the Arabic script to write other languages added and removed letters: for example ⟨ژ⟩ is often used to represent /ʒ/ in adaptations of the Arabic script. Unlike Greek-derived alphabets, Arabic has no distinct upper and lower case letterforms.\n\nMany letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (ʾiʿjām) above or below their central part (rasm). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters ب b, ت t, and ث th have the same basic shape, but with one dot added below, two dots added above, and three dots added above respectively. The letter ن n also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot added above, though it is somewhat different in its isolated and final forms. Historically, they were often omitted, in a writing style called rasm.\n\nBoth printed and written Arabic are cursive, with most letters within a word directly joined to adjacent letters.\n\nAlphabetical order\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two main collating sequences ('alphabetical orderings') for the Arabic alphabet: ʾabjadīy, and hijā’ī.\n\nThe original ʾabjadī order derives from that used by the Phoenician alphabet, and is therefore reminiscent of the orderings of other alphabets, such as those in Hebrew and Greek. With this ordering, letters are also used as numbers known as abjad numerals, possessing the same numerological codes as in Hebrew gematria and Greek isopsephy.\n\nThe hijā’ī or alifbāʾī order is used when sorting lists of words and names, such as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries. The ordering groups letters by the graphical similarity of the glyphs' shapes.\n\nAbjadi\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ʾabjadī order is not a simple correspondence with the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, as it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter samek ס, which has no cognate letter in the Arabic alphabet historically.\n\nThe loss of sameḵ was compensated for by:\n\nIn the Mashriqi abjad sequence, the letter shin ש was split into two Arabic letters, ش shīn and ﺱ sīn, the latter of which took the place of sameḵ.\n\nIn the Maghrebi abjad sequence, the letter tsade צ was split into two independent Arabic letters, ض ḍad and ص ṣad, with the latter taking the place of sameḵ.\n\nThe six other letters that do not correspond to any north Semitic letter are placed at the end.\n\nCommon abjadī sequence ا ب ج د ه و ز ح ط ي ك ل م ن س ع ف ص ق ر ش ت ث خ ذ ض ظ غ ʾ b j d h w z ḥ ṭ y k l m n s ʿ f ṣ q r sh t th kh dh ḍ ẓ gh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n\nThis is commonly vocalized as follows:\n\nʾabjad hawwaz ḥuṭṭī kalaman saʿfaṣ qarashat thakhadh ḍaẓagh.\n\nAnother vocalization is:\n\nʾabujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman saʿfaṣ qurishat thakhudh ḍaẓugh[citation needed]\n\nMaghrebian abjadī sequence (quoted in apparently earliest authorities & considered older)[4] ا ب ج د ه و ز ح ط ي ك ل م ن ص ع ف ض ق ر س ت ث خ ذ ظ غ ش ʾ b j d h w z ḥ ṭ y k l m n ṣ ʿ f ḍ q r s t th kh dh ẓ gh sh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 The colors indicate which letters have different positions from the previous table\n\nThis can be vocalized as:\n\nʾabujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman ṣaʿfaḍ qurisat thakhudh ẓaghush\n\nHijāʾī\n\n[edit]\n\nModern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the abjadī order to sort alphabetically; instead, the newer hijāʾī order is used wherein letters are partially grouped together by similarity of shape. The hijāʾī order is never used as numerals.\n\nCommon hijāʾī order ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي ʾ b t th j ḥ kh d dh r z s sh ṣ ḍ ṭ ẓ ʿ gh f q k l m n h w y\n\nIn the hijāʾī order replaced recently [when?] by the Mashriqi order,[4][unreliable source?] though still used in many Quranic schools in Algeria,[citation needed] the sequence is:\n\nMaghrebian hijāʾī order ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز ط ظ ك ل م ن ص ض ع غ ف ق س ش ه و ي ʾ b t th j ḥ kh d dh r z ṭ ẓ k l m n ṣ ḍ ʿ gh f q s sh h w y The colors indicate which letters have different positions from the previous table\n\nIn Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani's encyclopedia الإكليل من أخبار اليمن وأنساب حمير Kitāb al-Iklīl min akhbār al-Yaman wa-ansāb Ḥimyar, the letter sequence is:\n\nAl-Iklīl's order ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ك ل م و ن ص ض ع غ ط ظ ف ق ر ز ه س ش ي ʾ b t th j ḥ kh d dh k l m w n ṣ ḍ ʿ gh ṭ ẓ f q r z h s sh y\n\nLetter forms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is always cursive and letters vary in shape depending on their position within a word. Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position (IMFI). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters (و ,ز ,ر ,ذ ,د ,ا) can only be linked to their preceding letter. In addition, some letter combinations are written as ligatures (special shapes), notably lām-alif لا,[6] which is the only mandatory ligature (the unligated combination ل‍‌‍ا is considered difficult to read).\n\nTable of basic letters\n\n[edit]\n\nArabic letters usage in Literary Arabic Maghrebian Common Closest English\n\nequivalent in pronunciation Letter\n\nname\n\n(Classical pronunciation; IPA)\n\nLetter\n\nname in Arabic script[a] Value in Literary Arabic (IPA) Contextual forms Isolated\n\nform ʾAbjadī Hijāʾī ʾAbjadī Hijāʾī Final Medial Initial 1. 1. 1. 1. uh–oh / car, cat[b] ʾalif ([ʔælif]) أَلِف /aː/, /ʔ/[b] ـا ا 2. 2. 2. 2. barn bāʾ ([baːʔ]) بَاء /b/ ـب ـبـ بـ ب 22. 3. 22. 3. tick tāʾ ([taːʔ]) تَاء /t/ ـت ـتـ تـ ت 23. 4. 23. 4. think thāʾ ([θaːʔ]) / ṯāʾ ثَاء /θ/ ـث ـثـ ثـ ث 3. 5. 3. 5. gem jīm ([d͡ʒiːm]) جِيم /d͡ʒ/[c] ـج ـجـ جـ ج 8. 6. 8. 6. no equivalent\n\n(pharyngeal h) ḥāʾ ([ħæːʔ]) حَاء /ħ/ ـح ـحـ حـ ح 24. 7. 24. 7.

Arabic language speakers may usually not follow a standardized scheme when transcribing words or names. Some Arabic letters which do not have an equivalent in English (such as ط) are often spelled as numbers when Romanized. Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in Literary Arabic (if they were of Arabic origin).\n\nRegarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in schools and universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles Arabic phonology and varieties of Arabic.\n\nThe names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the Proto-Semitic language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.\n\nSix letters (و ز ر ذ د ا) do not have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form. The following letter is written in its initial form, or isolated form if it is the final letter in the word.\n\nThe letter alif originated in the Phoenician alphabet as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with ya’ and wāw, is a mater lectionis, a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (maddah and hamzah).\n\nArabic currently uses a punctuation mark called the hamzah (ء) to denote the glottal stop [ʔ], written alone or with a carrier:\n\nalone: ء\n\nwith a carrier: إ أ (above or under an alif), ؤ (above a wāw), ئ (above a dotless yā’ or yā’ hamzah).\n\nIn academic work, the hamzah is transliterated with the modifier letter right half ring (ʾ), while the modifier letter left half ring (ʿ) transliterates the letter ‘ayn (ع), which represents a different sound, not found in English.\n\nThe hamzah has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes combined with a wāw, yā’, or alif, and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary wāw, yā’, or alif, check the table below:\n\nHamzah forms\n\n[edit]\n\nName Contextual forms Isolated Position occurrence Final Medial Initial Hamzah ʿalā al-ʾalif (هَمْزَة عَلَى الأَلِفْ) ـأ أ Initial / Medial / Final positions Hamzah taḥt al-ʾalif (هَمْزَة تَحْت الأَلِفْ) - إ Initial position only Hamzah ʿalā as-saṭr (هَمْزَة عَلَى السَّطْر) ء - ء Medial / Final only Hamzah ʿalā al-wāw (هَمْزَة عَلَى الوَاو) ـؤ - ؤ Medial / Final only Hamzah ʿalā nabra (هَمْزَة عَلَى نَبْرَة) (medial)\n\nHamzah ʿalā al-yāʾ (هَمْزَة عَلَى اليَاء) (final) ـئ ـئـ - ئ Medial / Final only Hamzat al-madd (هَمْزَةْ المد) - ـآ آ Initial / Medial only\n\nFor the writing rule of each form, check Hamza.\n\nModified letters\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are not individual letters, but rather different contextual variants of some of the Arabic letters.\n\nName Contextual forms Isolated Translit.

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a W-shaped sign called shaddah, above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The diacritic only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable. (The generic term for such diacritical signs is ḥarakāt), e. g., درس darasa (with full diacritics: دَرَسَ) is a Form I verb meaning to study, whereas درّس darrasa (with full diacritics: دَرَّسَ) is the corresponding Form II verb, with the middle r consonant doubled, meaning to teach.\n\nGeneral Unicode Name Name in Arabic script Transliteration 0651\n\nــّـ ‎\n\nshaddah شَدَّة‎ (consonant doubled/geminated)\n\nNunation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nunation\n\nNunation (Arabic: تنوين tanwīn) is the addition of a final -n to a noun or adjective. The vowel before it indicates grammatical case. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel diacritic at the end of the word.\n\nLigatures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe use of ligature in Arabic is common. There is one compulsory ligature, that for lām ل + alif ا, which exists in two forms. All other ligatures, of which there are many,[7] are optional.\n\nContextual forms Name Trans. Value Final Medial Initial Isolated ﻼ‎ ﻻ‎ lām + alif laa /laː/ ﲓ‎ ﳰ‎ ﳝ‎[8] ﱘ‎ yāʾ + mīm īm /iːm/ ﲅ‎ ﳭ‎ ﳌ‎ ﱂ‎ lam + mīm lm /lm/\n\nA more complex ligature that combines as many as seven distinct components is commonly used to represent the word Allāh.\n\nThe only ligature within the primary range of Arabic script in Unicode (U+06xx) is lām + alif. This is the only one compulsory for fonts and word-processing. Other ranges are for compatibility to older standards and contain other ligatures, which are optional.\n\nlām + alif\n\nلا‎\n\nNote: Unicode also has in its Presentation Form B FExx range a code for this ligature.

Because Arabic script is used to write other texts rather than Quran only, rendering lām + lām + hā’ as the previous ligature is considered faulty.\n\nThis simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate in situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred. –SIL International[9]\n\nIf one of a number of the fonts (Noto Naskh Arabic, mry_KacstQurn, KacstOne, Nadeem, DejaVu Sans, Harmattan, Scheherazade, Lateef, Iranian Sans, Baghdad, DecoType Naskh) is installed on a computer (Iranian Sans is supported by Wikimedia web-fonts), the word will appear without diacritics.\n\nlām + lām + hā’ = LILLĀH (meaning \"to Allāh [only to God]\")\n\nلله‎ or لله\n\nalif + lām + lām + hā’ = ALLĀH (the Arabic word for \"god\")\n\nالله‎ or الله\n\nalif + lām + lām + U+0651 ARABIC SHADDA + U+0670 ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF + hā’\n\nاللّٰه (DejaVu Sans and KacstOne don't show the added superscript Alef)\n\nAn attempt to show them on the faulty fonts without automatically adding the gemination mark and the superscript alif, although may not display as desired on all browsers, is by adding the U+200d (Zero width joiner) after the first or second lām\n\n(alif +) lām + lām + U+200d ZERO WIDTH JOINER + hā’\n\nالل‍ه‎ ‎ لل‍ه‎\n\nVowels\n\n[edit]\n\nUsers of Arabic usually write long vowels but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the Qur’ān the three basic vowel signs are mandated, like the Arabic diacritics and other types of marks, like the cantillation signs.\n\nShort vowels\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Arabic diacritics\n\nIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the Qur’ān cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included. Children's books, elementary school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree. These are known as \"vocalized\" texts.\n\nShort vowels may be written with diacritics placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ḥarakāt. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like \"Ali\" or \"alif\", for example, start with a consonant: ‘Aliyy, alif.\n\nShort vowels\n\n(fully vocalized text) Code Name Name in Arabic script Trans.

Approximated to English \"I\" (as in \"pick\")\n\nLong vowels\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the fully vocalized Arabic text found in texts such as the Quran, a long ā following a consonant other than a hamzah is written with a short a sign (fatḥah) on the consonant plus an ʾalif after it; long ī is written as a sign for short i (kasrah) plus a yāʾ; and long ū as a sign for short u (ḍammah) plus a wāw. Briefly, ᵃa = ā; ⁱy = ī; and ᵘw = ū. Long ā following a hamzah may be represented by an ʾalif maddah or by a free hamzah followed by an ʾalif (two consecutive ʾalifs are never allowed in Arabic).\n\nThe table below shows vowels placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonant letter or a shaddah sign. For clarity in the table, the primary letters on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Most consonants do connect to the left with ʾalif, wāw and yāʾ written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the letter yāʾ in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form. Use the table of primary letters to look at their actual glyph and joining types.\n\nLong vowels (fully vocalized text) Unicode Letter with diacritic Name Trans.

Long vowels written in the middle of a word of unvocalized text are treated like consonants with a sukūn (see below) in a text that has full diacritics. Here also, the table shows long vowel letters only in isolated form for clarity.\n\nCombinations وا and يا are always pronounced wā and yāʾ respectively. The exception is the suffix ـوا۟ in verb endings where ʾalif is silent, resulting in ū or aw.\n\nLong vowels\n\n(unvocalized text) Name Trans.

In others, these y and w carry a sukūn. Outside of the Qur’ān, the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that y with sukūn will be unambiguously read as the diphthong /aj/, and w with sukūn will be read /aw/.\n\nFor example, the letters m-y-l can be read like English meel or mail, or (theoretically) also like mayyal or mayil. But if a sukūn is added on the y then the m cannot have a sukūn (because two letters in a row cannot be sukūnated), cannot have a ḍammah (because there is never an uy sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the y), and cannot have a kasrah (because kasrah before sukūnated y is never found outside the Qur’ān), so it must have a fatḥah and the only possible pronunciation is /majl/ (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a sukūn over the y can be mayt but not mayyit or meet, and m-w-t with a sukūn on the w can only be mawt, not moot (iw is impossible when the w closes the syllable).\n\nVowel marks are always written as if the i‘rāb vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name Aḥmad, it is optional to place a sukūn on the ḥ, but a sukūn is forbidden on the d, because it would carry a ḍammah if any other word followed, as in Aḥmadu zawjī \"Ahmad is my husband\".\n\nAnother example: the sentence that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced Aḥmadu zawjun shirrīr \"Ahmad is a wicked husband\", is usually pronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as Aḥmad zawj shirrīr. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīrun with a tanwīn 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an un tanwīn sign on the final r, but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a sukūn on that r, even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) sukūned.\n\nOf course, if the correct i‘rāb is a sukūn, it may be optionally written.\n\nGeneral Unicode Name Name in Arabic script Translit.

The Persian word ماسک (mâsk, from the English word \"mask\"), for example, might be written with a sukūn above the ﺱ to signify that there is no vowel sound between that letter and the ک.\n\nAdditional letters\n\n[edit]\n\nRegional variations\n\n[edit]\n\nSome letters take a traditionally different form in specific regions:\n\nLetter Explanation Isolated Final Medial Initial ڛ‎ ـڛ‎ ـڛـ‎ ڛـ‎ A traditional form to denotate the sīn س letter, used in areas influenced by Persian script and former Ottoman script, although rarely.

Visually identical to alif maqṣūrah ى; resembling the Perso-Arabic letter یـ ـیـ ـی ی which was also used in Ottoman Turkish.\n\nThe phoneme /g/ is considered native in most Arabic dialects, below are the different representations of the phoneme in native and loanwords:\n\nArabic Dialects Moroccan Tunisian Algerian Egyptian Najdi Hejazi South Levantine North Levantine Iraqi Gulf ڭ‎ / گ‎ / ق‎ ڨ‎ / ق‎ ج‎ ق‎ ك‎ / ج‎ / ق‎ ك‎ / ج‎ گ‎ / ك‎ / ق‎ ق / گ‎\n\nNon-native letters to Standard Arabic\n\n[edit]\n\nSome modified letters are used to represent non-native sounds of Modern Standard Arabic. These letters are used in transliterated names, loanwords and dialectal words.\n\nLetter Value Note پ‎ /p/ Sometimes used when transliterating foreign names and loanwords instead of bā’ ب‎ ڤ‎ /v/ Sometimes used when transliterating foreign names and loanwords instead of fā’ ف‎.[11] Not to be confused with ڨ‎. ڥ‎ Used in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. چ‎ /t͡ʃ/1 Used in Gulf and Iraqi Arabic dialects.

E.g. in Egypt, ج spells /g/ in all cases,[12] the same applies to Oman, and coastal Yemen. Regionally, in MSA or dialects, /ɡ/ is differently spelled in loanwords; most commonly ج, غ, ق, and ك. For example, \"golf\" can be written جولف, غولف, قولف, or كولف /ɡolf/.\n\nUsed in languages other than Arabic\n\n[edit]\n\nNumerals\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Western Arabic numerals and Eastern Arabic numerals\n\nWestern\n\n(Maghreb, Europe) Central\n\n(Mideast) Eastern Persian Urdu 0 ٠ ۰ ۰ 1 ١ ۱ ۱ 2 ٢ ۲ ۲ 3 ٣ ۳ ۳ 4 ٤ ۴ ۴ 5 ٥ ۵ ۵ 6 ٦ ۶ ۶ 7 ٧ ۷ ۷ 8 ٨ ۸ ۸ 9 ٩ ۹ ۹ 10 ١٠ ۱۰ ۱۰\n\nThere are two main kinds of numerals used along with Arabic text; Western Arabic numerals and Eastern Arabic numerals. In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most. Eastern Arabic numbers are written from left to right.\n\nLetters as numerals\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Abjad numerals\n\nIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers (Abjad numerals). This usage is based on the ʾabjadī order of the alphabet. أ ʾalif is 1, ب bāʾ is 2, ج jīm is 3, and so on until ي yāʾ = 10, ك kāf = 20, ل lām = 30, ..., ر rāʾ = 200, ..., غ ghayn = 1000. This is sometimes used to produce chronograms.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the Nabataean script used to write Nabataean Aramaic. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late fourth-century inscription from Jabal Ram 50 km east of ‘Aqabah in Jordan, but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at Zebed in Syria from 512.[citation needed] However, the epigraphic record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them. (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 14 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous Book Pahlavi.)\n\nThe first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in Qurʾan memorization.\n\nLater still, vowel marks and the hamzah were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of Syriac and Tiberian vocalizations. Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned in the Umayyad era by Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali, a dot above = a, a dot below = i, a dot on the line = u, and doubled dots indicated nunation. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi.\n\nOther tributes and alphabets written in Arabic dialects\n\n[edit]\n\nArabic dialects were written in different alphabets before the spread of the Arabic alphabet currently in use. The most important of these alphabets and inscriptions are the Safaitic inscriptions, amounting to 30,000 inscriptions discovered in the Levant desert.[16]\n\nThere are about 3,700 inscriptions in Hismaic in central Jordan and northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, and Nabataean inscriptions, the most important of which are the Umm al-Jimal I inscription and the Numara inscription.[17]\n\nArabic printing\n\n[edit]\n\nMedieval Arabic blockprinting flourished from the 10th century until the 14th. It was devoted only to very small texts, usually for use in amulets.\n\nIn 1514, following Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i and was intended for eastern Christian communities.[18] Between 1580 and 1586, type designer Robert Granjon designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, and the Medici Oriental Press published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.[19]\n\nMaronite monks at Maar Quzhay Monastery on Mount Lebanon published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East. The monks transliterated the Arabic language using Syriac script.\n\nAlthough Napoleon generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to Egypt during his invasion of the country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and Arabic presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper Al-Tanbiyyah \"The Courier\", printing in the Arabic language had started several centuries earlier. A goldsmith (like Gutenberg) designed and implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The Lebanese Melkite monk Abdallah Zakher set up an Arabic printing press using movable type at the monastery of Saint John at the town of Dhour El Shuwayr in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.[20]\n\nComputers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several character sets, including ISO-8859-6, Windows-1256 and Unicode, the latter of which contains the \"Arabic segment\", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of the sets indicates the form that each character should take in context. It is left to the rendering engine to select the proper glyph to display for each character.\n\nEach letter has a position-independent encoding in Unicode, and the rendering software can infer the correct glyph form (initial, medial, final or isolated) from its joining context. That is the current recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, medial, final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.\n\nUnicode\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Arabic script in Unicode\n\nAs of Unicode 15.1, the Arabic script is contained in the following blocks:[21]\n\nArabic (0600–06FF, 256 characters)\n\nArabic Supplement (0750–077F, 48 characters)\n\nArabic Extended-A (08A0–08FF, 96 characters)\n\nArabic Extended-B (0870–089F, 41 characters)\n\nArabic Extended-C (10EC0–10EFF, 3 characters)\n\nArabic Presentation Forms-A (FB50–FDFF, 631 characters)\n\nArabic Presentation Forms-B (FE70–FEFF, 141 characters)\n\nRumi Numeral Symbols (10E60–10E7F, 31 characters)\n\nIndic Siyaq Numbers (1EC70–1ECBF, 68 characters)\n\nOttoman Siyaq Numbers (1ED00–1ED4F, 61 characters)\n\nArabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols (1EE00—1EEFF, 143 characters)\n\nThe basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on ISO 8859-6). It also includes the most common diacritics and Arabic-Indic digits. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as \"end of ayah\" ۝ۖ and \"start of rub el hizb\" ۞. The Arabic supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages.\n\nThe Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.\n\nSee also the notes of the section on modified letters.\n\nKeyboards\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Keyboard layout and Arabic keyboard\n\nKeyboards designed for different nations have different layouts, so proficiency in one style of keyboard, such as Iraq's, does not transfer to proficiency in another, such as Saudi Arabia's. Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAll Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a web browser. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually, the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the QWERTY layout, but in North Africa, where French is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are AZERTY.\n\nTo encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range Arabic presentation forms A (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range Arabic presentation forms B (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the zero-width joiner and zero-width non-joiner, as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software; when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings; or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.\n\nFinally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in logical order, that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's bi-directional text features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.[22][23]\n\nThere are competing online tools, e.g. Yamli editor, which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.[24]\n\nHandwriting recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time was developed by researchers at Ben-Gurion University (BGU).\n\nThe prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second. The error rate is less than three percent, according to Dr. Jihad El-Sana, from BGU's department of computer sciences, who developed the system along with master's degree student Fadi Biadsy.[25]\n\nVariations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe modern hijā’ī sequence and abjadī sequence (excluding hamzah) in 15 fonts: يوهنملكقفغعظطضصشسزرذدخحجثتبا hijā’ī sequence • Noto Nastaliq Urdu • Scheherazade New • Lateef • Noto Naskh Arabic • Markazi Text • Noto Sans Arabic • El Messiri • Lemonada • Changa • Mada • Noto Kufi Arabic • Reem Kufi • Lalezar • Jomhuria • Rakkas غظضذخثتشرقصفعسنملكيطحزوهدجبا abjadī sequence • Noto Nastaliq Urdu • Scheherazade New • Lateef • Noto Naskh Arabic • Markazi Text • Noto Sans Arabic • El Messiri • Lemonada • Changa • Mada • Noto Kufi Arabic • Reem Kufi • Lalezar • Jomhuria • Rakkas\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nMacdonald, Michael C.
