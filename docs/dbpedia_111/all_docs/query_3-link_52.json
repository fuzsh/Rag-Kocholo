        "text": "Crafting a witty Tweet, optimizing your Instagram posts with hashtags or brainstorming copy for Facebook ads may all seem like completely different tasks. But they all have one thing in common – they each have a platform-specific character limit.\n\nMore importantly, you need to know the ideal character count for social media content. This could improve your chances of getting people to read or engage with your posts.\n\nTo make your job a little easier, we’ve put together a detailed guide on social media character limits and ideal post lengths. We’ve also included a free social media character counter to test the length of your social posts before you hit “Post.”\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook ads character count\n\nFacebook generally has the same character limit across all ad types, with the exception of carousel ads and in-stream video ads.\n\nHeadline – 40 characters\n\nBody text – 125 characters\n\nLink descriptions – 30 characters (20 for carousel ads and in-stream video ads)\n\nPair these Facebook ad character counts with our Facebook ad size guide to create the perfect ad.\n\nFacebook posts character count\n\nFacebook is the perfect place to share long-form content, with the platform allowing up to 63,206 characters in regular posts. This gives you ample space to tell a detailed story or explain something in-depth.\n\nIdeal Facebook post length\n\nBut just because you can post a lengthy status update on Facebook doesn’t mean you should. In fact, short posts tend to perform better even on Facebook.\n\nAccording to a BuzzSumo analysis, the ideal Facebook post length is around 50 characters (or fewer), which tends to get the most engagement.\n\nThat said, what engages your audience will also vary depending on your industry. So we recommend testing out what works for you specifically and trying out different Facebook post lengths to find the ideal character count for you.\n\nFacebook maximum character limits\n\nBesides posts and ads, Facebook also has character limits for usernames, Page descriptions and comments:\n\nUsername character limit – at least 5 characters and up to 50 characters\n\nPage description – 255 Characters\n\nFacebook comments – 8,000 Characters\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram ads character limit\n\nThe character limit for Instagram ads is similar to that of Facebook.\n\nHeadline – 40 characters\n\nBody text – 125 characters\n\nLink descriptions – 30 characters\n\nFor more specifics around Instagram ads, check out our Instagram ad size guide.\n\nInstagram captions character count\n\nThe Instagram caption limit is 2,200 characters. So there’s sufficient space to add context to your posts through your captions. It’s also important to note that Instagram captions are truncated at 125 characters.\n\nIdeal Instagram caption length\n\nWhile 2,200 characters is abundant caption real estate, huge blocks of text may look messy and distract people from the main focus of the post, i.e., your photo or video. The ideal length is 1-50 characters, as Quintly found that these tend to drive more interactions in an analysis of 5.9 million posts.\n\nHowever, you may also want to test longer captions to see how your audience responds and how engagement varies by post type. For instance, longer captions could work well with informative and educational posts. But fun and casual posts may need just a few words in the caption or even a few emojis.\n\nCheck out some of the best caption ideas we put together to make the most of this space.\n\nInstagram Hashtags\n\nMaximum Instagram hashtag limit\n\nInstagram allows you to add up to 30 hashtags per post. But stuffing your caption space with all the hashtags you can use isn’t always a good idea. In fact, using irrelevant hashtags could put your account at risk of getting shadowbanned.\n\nIdeal Instagram hashtag limit\n\nThe same Quintly study found that fewer hashtags (between 1 and 10) tend to drive more interactions overall. For larger profiles with 10+ million followers, using zero hashtags worked even better. However, this doesn’t apply to smaller profiles (fewer than 1k followers) since their reach is more limited. For these profiles, using 10+ hashtags drove the most interactions.\n\nOur Instagram hashtag guide has more tips and ideas on how to make the most of hashtags in your posts.\n\nMaximum Instagram character limits\n\nInstagram also sets a limit on how long your bio and username can be:\n\nInstagram bio character limit – 150 characters\n\nInstagram username character limit – 30 characters\n\nTwitter\n\nTweet character count\n\nWithin the last few years, Twitter increased Tweet character counts from 140 to 280 characters.\n\nIdeal Tweet length\n\nUnlike with other social platforms, longer posts tend to perform better on Twitter, according to reports from Sotrender and the Chicago Tribune. The sweet spot is between 240 and 259 characters, which tend to get the most likes, replies, Retweets, impressions and link clicks on average.\n\nTwitter maximum character limits\n\nTwitter also puts a cap on how long your DMs, profile name, bio and handle can be:\n\nDMs – 10,000 characters\n\nTwitter handle – 15 characters\n\nProfile name – 50 characters\n\nBio – 160 characters\n\nPinterest maximum character limits\n\nPinterest sets limits on the number of boards and Pins you can create to keep the platform running smoothly. Besides that, there are character limits to maintain in the text areas as well:\n\nMaximum number of Pinterest boards – 2,000\n\nMaximum number of Pins – 200,000\n\nProfile name – 30 characters\n\nBio – 160 characters\n\nUsername – 30 characters\n\nBoard name – 50 characters\n\nBoard description – 500 characters\n\nPin title – 100 characters\n\nPin description – 500 characters\n\nWhile Pinterest has a pretty lenient allowance on descriptions, only the first 50 characters will show up when people initially click on your board or Pin.\n\nIf you’re just starting out on Pinterest or looking for ways to up your game, check out our guide on using Pinterest for businesses to make the most of this platform.\n\nLinkedIn maximum character limits\n\nLinkedIn offers plenty of areas for users to enter text, with each having its own character limit. Here’s a quick look at some of them:\n\nFirst name – 20 characters\n\nLast name – 40 characters\n\nStatus update (personal profile) – 1,300 characters\n\nAbout us/Summary – 2,000 characters\n\nCompany Page name – 100 characters\n\nCompany update – 700 characters\n\nCompany leaders headline – 150 characters\n\nCompany leaders description – 150 characters\n\nEmployee testimonials – 400 characters\n\nTitle of custom module – 150 characters\n\nBody of custom module – 500 characters\n\nURL label for custom module – 70 characters\n\nRecommendation – 3,000 characters\n\nLinkedIn Publishing post headline – 100 characters\n\nLinkedIn Publishing content length – 110,000 characters\n\nWith LinkedIn offering a vast range of advertising options as well, the text character limit also varies depending on which ad type you’re running. Check out our comprehensive guide on LinkedIn ads to find out the specs for each ad type.\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile YouTube may solely be about video, it also has a few text fields. The platform puts a cap on how many characters you can use in these fields:\n\nVideo title – 100 characters\n\nYouTube description – 5,000 characters\n\nPlaylist titles – 150 characters\n\nYouTube tags – 500 characters total\n\nFree social media character counter\n\nWant to know if your social posts are making the cut in terms of character count?
