        "text": "Two-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1\n\nISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are two-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard[1] published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO (the others being alpha-3 and numeric), and are used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions). They are also used as country identifiers extending the postal code when appropriate within the international postal system for paper mail, and have replaced the previous one consisting one-letter codes. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.\n\nUses and applications\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in different environments and are also part of other standards. In some cases they are not perfectly implemented.\n\nPerfect implementations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in the following standards:\n\nShort name Long name Comment ISO 3166-2 Country subdivision code[1] ISO 3901 International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)[2] ISO 4217 Currency code[3] ISO 6166 International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN)[4] ISO 9362 Bank Identifier Codes (BIC) Also known as SWIFT codes[5] ISO 13616 International Bank Account Number (IBAN)[6] ISO 15511 International Standard Identifier for Libraries and Related Organizations (ISIL) UN/LOCODE United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations Implemented by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe[7]\n\nImperfect implementations\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in 1985, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes have been used in the Domain Name System as country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority currently assigns the ccTLDs mostly following the alpha-2 codes, but with a few exceptions.[8] For example, the United Kingdom, whose alpha-2 code is GB, uses .uk instead of .gb as its ccTLD, as UK is currently exceptionally reserved in ISO 3166-1 on the request of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe WIPO coding standard ST.3 is based on ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, but includes a number of additional codes for international intellectual property organizations, which are currently reserved and not used at the present stage in ISO 3166-1.[9]\n\nThe European Commission generally uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes with two exceptions: EL (not GR) is used to represent Greece, and UK (not GB) is used to represent the United Kingdom.[10][11] This notwithstanding, the Official Journal of the European Communities specified that GR and GB be used to represent Greece and United Kingdom respectively.[12] For VAT administration purposes, the European Commission uses EL and GB for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively.\n\nThe United Nations uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for international vehicle registration codes, which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently indeterminately reserved in ISO 3166-1.[13]\n\nIETF language tags (conforming to the BCP 47 standard track and maintained in an IANA registry) are also partially derived from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (for the region subtags). The full list of ISO 3166-1 codes assigned to countries and territories are usable as region subtags. Also, the \"exceptionally reserved\" alpha-2 codes defined in ISO 3166-1 (with the exception of UK) are also usable as region subtags for language tags. However, newer stability policies (agreed with ISO) have been implemented to avoid deleting subtags that have been withdrawn in ISO 3166-1; instead they are kept and aliased to the new preferred subtags, or kept as subtags grouping several countries. Some other region grouping subtags are derived from other standards. Under the newer stability policies, old assigned codes that have been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1 should no longer be reassigned to another country or territory (as has occurred in the past for \"CS\").\n\nCurrent codes\n\n[edit]\n\nDecoding table\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a colour-coded decoding table of all ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.\n\nDecoding table of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes AA AB

The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned: AA, QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ.[21] For example:\n\nThe International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) uses QM as a second country code for the United States, as it ran out of three-character registrant codes within the US prefix. It also uses ZZ for some registrants assigned directly.[22]\n\nThe Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) assigns QO to represent Outlying Oceania (a multi-territory region containing Antarctica, Bouvet Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the French Southern Territories, and the United States Minor Outlying Islands), and ZZ to represent \"Unknown or Invalid Territory\". Before the adoption of the macroregion code EU by ISO, CLDR also used QU to represent the European Union.[23]\n\nThe code QZ is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) as an indicator for the Community Plant Variety Office.\n\nThe code XA is being used by Switzerland[24] as a country code for the Canary Islands, although IC is already reserved for that purpose.\n\nThe codes XA and XO are being used by Russia[25] to represent Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively.\n\nThe code XI is being used by the UK Government,[26] as an EORI number country code prefix for Northern Ireland, and the members of European Union for European Union value added tax reports with trade with Northern Ireland.[27]\n\nThe code XK is being used by the European Commission[28] the IMF, and SWIFT,[29] the CLDR, and other organizations as a temporary country code for Kosovo.[30]\n\nThe code XN is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the Nordic Patent Institute, an international organization common to Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.[31]\n\nThe code XU is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.\n\nThe code XV is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the Visegrad Patent Institute.\n\nThe code XX is being used by WIPO as an indicator for unknown states, other entities or organizations.\n\nUN/LOCODE assigns XZ to represent installations in international waters.[7]\n\nFurthermore, the code element OO is designated as an escape code if the number of regular user-assigned code elements is not sufficient.[32]\n\nReserved code elements\n\n[edit]\n\nReserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. The reserved alpha-2 codes can be divided into the following four categories: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, indeterminate reservations, and codes currently agreed not to use.\n\nExceptional reservations\n\n[edit]\n\nExceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-2 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:\n\nCode Area name or country name Current actual country ccTLD Notes AC Ascension Island United Kingdom .ac Reserved on request of UPU for stamp issuing area CP Clipperton Island France â Reserved on request of ITU for location of certain telecommunications installations CQ Island of Sark United Kingdom â Reserved on request of the United Kingdom.

These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-2 codes are currently transitionally reserved:\n\nCode Formerly used country name Reserved from Reserved to ccTLD ISO 3166-3 Notes AN Netherlands Antilles 2010-12 2060-12 .an ANHH Divided into BQ (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba), CW (CuraÃ§ao) and SX (Dutch part of Sint Maarten) BU Burma 1989-12 2039-12 â BUMM Name changed to Myanmar (MM) CS Originally Czechoslovakia, later Serbia and Montenegro 2006-09 2056-09 (.yu) CSHH\n\nCSXX Code taken from name in Serbian: Srbija i Crna Gora, for Serbia and Montenegro, which however is now divided into Montenegro (ME) and Serbia (RS).\n\n(Though reserved, the ccTLD .cs was never actually assigned to Serbia and Montenegro; the ccTLD of Serbia and Montenegro was .yu, as that formerly unified country's name, and that of its larger predecessor, had previously been Yugoslavia.)\n\nCS originally represented Czechoslovakia. Its successor state Czechia uses CZ, and Slovakia SK.

Each entry is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code, where the first two letters are the deleted alpha-2 code.\n\nIndeterminate reservations\n\n[edit]\n\nIndeterminately reserved code elements are codes used to designate road vehicles under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Conventions on Road Traffic but differing from those contained in ISO 3166-1. These code elements are expected eventually to be either eliminated or replaced by code elements within ISO 3166-1. In the meantime, the ISO 3166/MA has reserved such code elements for an indeterminate period. Any use beyond the application of the two Conventions is discouraged and will not be approved by the ISO 3166/MA. Moreover, these codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA at any time. The following alpha-2 codes are currently indeterminately reserved:\n\nCode elements reserved indeterminately Code Area name or country name Current code Notes DY Benin BJ [note 1] EW Estonia EE [note 1] FL Liechtenstein LI [note 2] JA Jamaica JM [note 3] LF Libya Fezzan [note 2] PI Philippines PH [note 3] RA Argentina AR [note 3] RB Bolivia [cf.

However, EA was already exceptionally reserved by the ISO 3166/MA to represent Ceuta and Melilla for customs purposes. The ISO 3166/MA proposed in 1995 that EV be used by WIPO to represent the Eurasian Patent Organization; however, this request was not honoured by WIPO.\n\nDeleted codes\n\n[edit]\n\nBesides the codes currently transitionally reserved and two other codes currently exceptionally reserved ( FX for France, Metropolitan and SU for USSR), the following alpha-2 codes have also been deleted from ISO 3166-1:[35]\n\nCode Formerly used country name ISO 3166-3 Notes AI French Afars and Issas AIDJ Code later reassigned to Anguilla BQ British Antarctic Territory BQAQ Code later reassigned to Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba CT Canton and Enderbury Islands CTKI DD German Democratic Republic DDDE Code taken from name in German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik\n\nCommon name: East Germany DY Dahomey DYBJ Name changed to Benin (BJ)\n\nThe code is now indeterminately reserved.
