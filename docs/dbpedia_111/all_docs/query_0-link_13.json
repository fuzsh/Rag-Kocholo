Sure, there is a map on the main page, but it's just one example of what you can do with the data.\n\nIf you want to create a map with the same data but with larger fonts used for text, you can. The answer to the other question that you linked to explains a bit about it, although it might take a little while to get your head around the osm.xml file used to control how things are displayed by the standard OSM rendering stack. The switch2osm site describes setting up your own tile server in some detail.\n\nIf you really think that what the map on the main page does right now is wrong, then you can add an enhancement request here. Unfortunately, there can be conflicting requests (e.g. \"make the text bigger\", \"show more things\", \"make it cleaner and easier to read\") so not everything is possible."
