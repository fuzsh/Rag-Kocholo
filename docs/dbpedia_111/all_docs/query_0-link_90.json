        "text": "A fictional character is a person or animal in a narrative work of fiction (such as a novel, play, television series, or movie) [1][2][3] The character can be completely made up or based on a real-life person. In that case, the difference between a \"fictional\" and \"real\" character can be made.[2] A character who is based on more than one person is called a Composite character. Coming from the ancient Greek word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the Restoration,[4] although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749.[5][6] From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed.[6] Character, mainly when played by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person.\"[7] In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.[8] Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor.[6] Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.[6]\n\nThe word character can also mean \"personality\". We can say that someone has a \"strong character\" meaning a strong, confident personality. It is sometimes used as a noun in this sense: \"He is a real character\" (meaning someone you cannot easily forget)."
