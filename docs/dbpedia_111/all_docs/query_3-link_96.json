        "text": "Highlights are three to five (three to four for Cell Press articles) bullet points that help increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. These bullet points should capture the novel results of your research as well as new methods that were used during the study (if any). Think of them as the \"elevator pitch\" of your article. Please include terms that you know your readers will be looking for online. Don't try to capture all ideas, concepts or conclusions as highlights are meant to be short: 85 characters or fewer, including spaces.\n\nHighlights offer your paper a considerable advantage in the online world, as they ensure that search engines pick up your article and match it to the right audience. (Nowadays, machines read your work just as often as humans do!). Highlights have been proven to widen the reach of your work and help to ensure that your article is brought to the attention of interested colleagues, both inside and outside your usual research community. Apart from a wider distribution of your research, we hope that this will also lead to new collaborations and help accelerate the pace of science.\n\nThe small print\n\nNot part of editorial consideration and aren't required until the final files stage\n\nOnly required for full research articles\n\nMust be provided as a Word documentâ select \"Highlights\" from the drop-down list when uploading files\n\nEach Highlight can be no more than 85 characters, including spaces\n\nNo jargon, acronyms, or abbreviations: aim for a general audience and use keywords\n\nConsider the reader - Highlights are the first thing they'll see\n\nExamples\n\nFrom:Â Cancer Cell, Volume 32, Issue 2, 14 August 2017, Pages 169-184.e7opens in new tab/window\n\nHighlights\n\nMetastases mostly disseminate late from primary breast tumors, keeping most drivers\n\nDrivers at relapse sample from a wider range of cancer genes than in primary tumors\n\nMutations in SWI-SNF complex and inactivated JAK-STAT signaling enriched at relapse\n\nMutational processes similar in primary and relapse; radiotherapy can damage genome\n\nFrom:Â Learning and Instruction, Volume 21, Issue 6, December 2011, 746-756opens in new tab/window\n\nHighlights"
