Status of element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List\n\nRefer to the nomination file or to previous reports, if any, as the basis for reporting on the current status of the element, and report only on relevant changes since the date of inscription on the List or since the previous report. Nomination files, specific timetables and earlier reports, if any, are available at https://ich.unesco.org or from the Secretariat, upon request.\n\nThe State Party shall pay special attention to the role of gender and shall endeavour to ensure the widest possible participation of the communities, groups and, where applicable, individuals concerned as well as relevant non-governmental organizations during the process of preparing this report, and is asked to describe how it has done so in point D below.\n\nB.1.\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nPlease explain the social and cultural functions and meanings of the element today, within and for its community, the characteristics of the bearers and practitioners, and any specific roles or categories of persons with special responsibilities towards the element, among others. Attention should be given to any relevant changes related to inscription criterion U.1 (‘the element constitutes intangible cultural heritage as defined in Article 2 of the Convention’).\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nAs a system of skills and knowledge, the element has been constantly transmitted and enhanced through its interaction with nature and history to meet various social needs. It is mainly used in the compiling and printing of clan genealogies in local communities and provides important means of livelihood for the bearers. Its practice has helped to record the history and kinship of families, reflect path of local social development and the venation of cultural transmission, and give local people deep insight into their fine traditional culture and distinctive history. It has important social and cultural functions in all communities where the element spreads. It has become an important cultural medium for people of different groups to understand and recognize their own history.\n\nThe craftsmen who master relevant skills are the bearers of this element; they are recognized as \"genealogy masters\" by the local people. They undertake the tasks of editing, printing and binding of different clan genealogies as entrusted by genealogy editing councils. By practicing the element, they also help to disseminate the Chinese genealogical culture. The core system of the element has a fixed pattern and mature procedures, but there is no standard model workflow, and there is room for different groups and individuals to develop their creativity. Knowledge and skills of the element are traditionally transmitted from genealogy masters to their apprentices or within families. At present, the representative bearers are Lin Chuyin, Wang Chuanqiao, Wang Zhiren and Wu Shumei (female), etc.\n\nB.2.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nPlease describe the current level of viability of the element, particularly the frequency and extent of its practice, the strength of traditional modes of transmission, the demographics of practitioners and audiences and its sustainability. Please also identify and describe the threats, if any, to the element's continued transmission and enactment and describe the severity and immediacy of such threats, giving particular attention to any strengthening or weakening of the element’s viability subsequent to inscription.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nThe element is mainly concentrated in southern Zhejiang Province, especially in Wenzhou City, and parts of Fujian Province. It is also practiced in eastern and northern Zhejiang Province. As of this reporting period, there are 22 representative bearers, an increase of 5 compared to the previous cycle, with average age dropped from 62.87 to 60.21. Major transmission communities include Dongyuan Village of Pingyangkeng Town and Xiqian Village of Caocun Town in Rui'an City, as well as the neighboring Pingyang County and some areas beyond Wenzhou City. During this reporting period, the bearers have taken 62 orders for genealogy printing, down 60% compared to the previous cycle, and their annual income was about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The decrease of orders was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the gatherings needed at the beginning and end of genealogy editing and compiling activities and resulted in postponed printing plan from the clans. Due to high labor cost and limited market demand, the printing business of ancient books has also declined with only 1,500 copies of five ancient books being printed, including the Thousand Characters and the Selected Ancient Poems. However, through the development of cultural products and experiential learning, the frequency of practice has been increased and the scope been expanded, generating supplementary economic benefits for bearers and practitioners.\n\nAt present, the transmission of the element still faces the following risks:\n\n• First, the computer typesetting is less costly and requires fewer workers, leading to the declining cost of typesetting and printing of genealogies. During this reporting period, about 10 clans from Rui'an City have switched to digital technology for genealogy printing, up about 10% over the previous cycle, and the main practice space of the element has been further squeezed.\n\n• Second, with the increased awareness of intangible cultural heritage and its importance, along with the growing appreciation for traditional culture, the clans are becoming more demanding while the bearers are running short of necessary knowledge to satisfy the actual needs of their customers. There is also a growing number of other competitive parties entering the genealogy compiling and printing market.\n\n• Third, the sustainability of inter-generational transmission is still under pressure. At present, most of the bearers are above 60 years old, and there are only 14 senior bearers left (3 senior bearers including Wang Chaohui have passed away since last reporting period). Movable-type printing is a complex and highly technical process and requires related knowledge of genealogical culture. Given the time-consuming learning process, limited opportunities of practice and unstable income, the population of young apprentices remains small.\n\nB.3.\n\nImplementation of safeguarding measures\n\nPlease report on the safeguarding measures described in the nomination file, and previous report, if any. Describe how they have been implemented and how they have substantially contributed to the safeguarding of the element during the reporting period, taking note of external or internal constraints such as limited resources. Include, in particular, information on the measures taken to ensure the viability of the element by enabling the community to continue to practise and transmit it. Include the following detailed information concerning the implementation of the set of safeguarding measures or safeguarding plan:\n\nB.3.a.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nIndicate what primary objective(s) were addressed and what concrete results were attained during the reporting period.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nDuring this reporting period, the following goals have been achieved:\n\n• The number of the bearers has increased and their overall competence has improved to some extent. Five new representative bearers have been identified, including one female; they have acquired a full set of related skills and are all under the age of 50. There are 39 registered apprentices and about 300 practitioners, 60 more than the previous cycle, including over 40 women; their educational level has been raised from below junior high school to above junior high school.\n\n• The scope of practice has been expanded and the frequency has been increased. The bearers have been active and creative in developing relevant cultural products by integrating the element with other traditional techniques.\n\n• Documentation and research have been improved. With the involvement of the bearers, practitioners and community members, actions have been taken in the basic survey of the element, documentation of the bearers, digitization of related technological processes, and improvement of the existing database. In addition, academic seminars have been held for community-based capacity building; research institutes have been established with active involvement of experts and scholars, providing a platform for more in-depth interaction between academic community and the bearers and practitioners.\n\n• The visibility has been improved. Exhibitions and experiential learning activities have been held in Rui'an Movable-type Printing Exhibition Hall, Rui'an Intangible Cultural Heritage Center and Rui'an Museum, through which the awareness of the element and its safeguarding achievements have been raised among the public. Relevant communities, groups and individuals have spontaneously carried out exhibition activities on the Cultural and Natural Heritage Day, and during the China Expo of Traditional Skills of Intangible Cultural Heritage; the element and related historical and cultural knowledge have been communicated through traditional and social media platforms; experience centers have been open to the public. All of this has contributed to the enhanced awareness of the element and the intangible cultural heritage as a whole.\n\nB.3.b.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nList the key activities that were carried out during this reporting period in order to achieve these expected results. Please describe the activities in detail and note their effectiveness or any problems encountered in implementing them.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nDuring this reporting period, multiple actors including relevant communities, groups and individuals, and governments at all levels have jointly carried out the following safeguarding activities:\n\n• Promoting inter-generational transmission\n\nTwo training workshops facilitated by the bearers were held for apprentices, with a total of 34 participants who were evaluated upon the completion of the courses as part of the apprenticeship training mechanism. Educational activities were carried out in Kaiyuan Vocational School, Pingyangkeng School and Ma’anshan Experimental Primary School in Rui’an City; movable-type printing courses were offered, taught by invited bearers, in four institutes of higher education beyond Rui’an City, including Zhejiang Industry & Trade Vocational College. Five representative bearers from Rui'an City were newly identified as recommended by communities concerned, all of whom were both beneficiaries of the ongoing training workshops and apprentices of the representative bearers. Governments at all levels provided annual subsidies for the bearers recognized at different levels to take apprentices and carry out transmission activities, encouraged social forces to invest in the safeguarding of the element, and introduced relevant policies to improve the enthusiasm of the bearers. For example, the annual subsidy for each provincial level representative bearer has increased from 5,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan since 2022; the subsidy for training cultural talents has increased by 1,000 yuan per person and the daily allowances for young apprentices during the training are 150 yuan per person. Wang Fawan, the bearer, has been exempted from 3-year rent for running his shop in the historical and cultural block of Zhongyi Street, Rui'an City.\n\n• Increasing the frequency and expanding scope of practice\n\nThe bearers integrated the movable-type printing with woodblock printing, bamboo paper making as well as paper cutting techniques and applied them to the production of the letters of admission of universities, and provided element-related services for local communities, such as producing customized name seals for students of Anyang Experimental Middle School in Rui'an City. In addition, the bearers also developed over 20 kinds of cultural products associated with the element, such as wooden type gift boxes, wall hanging panels, and pen containers.\n\n• Strengthening documentation and research\n\nMultimedia technologies were applied to the documentation of the process, technologies, tools and objects of the element; 6.42 hours of interviews and introductory films, 4 hours of audio recordings, 154,000 words of text files and 102 photos were collected and produced to enrich the archival data. The Chinese movable-type printing webpage（https://www.ihchina.cn/printing_home.html）was set up. Rui'an Movable-type Printing Association developed a computer font library of \"Lao Song Ti or Ancient Sim Sun”, the engraved version for movable type printing, applied to cultural and creative products. \"China (Rui’an) Movable-type Printing Transmission and Development Seminar\", \"Academic Seminar on Movable-type Printing\" and \"the Second Session of ICH and Modern Vocational Education in Zhejiang Province\" were held; and related research findings such as \"Views on the Contemporary Value and Communication Path of Rui’an Wooden Movable-type Printing\" and \"Reflections on the Transmission & Innovation of Rui’an Dongyuan Wooden Movable-type Printing\" were released. Rui'an Wooden Movable-type Printing Culture Research Institute was established in Pingyangkeng Town of Rui'an City; more than 10 relevant experts were involved in the research on the safeguarding of the element. Rui'an Surname Culture Research Association, based on the actual situation of the element, formulated \"the Standards for Genealogy Compiling and Editing in Rui’an City (Trial)\" and began to implement it on a pilot basis.\n\n• Enhancing the visibility of the element\n\nPermanent exhibitions were organized and representative works of the bearers were collected in Rui'an Movable-type Printing Exhibition Hall, Rui'an ICH Center, and Rui'an Museum. Experiential Learning Hall was set up in \"the Chinese Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall\" in Dongyuan Village, Rui'an City, where research and experiential activities were carried out by the bearers, involving 131,000 visits. This not only improved young people's understanding of the element, increased the bearers' income, but also created jobs for local communities. The bearers and related groups held exhibitions during such festivals and events as the Cultural and Natural Heritage Day, Zhejiang ICH Expo in 2019, the Third Grand Canal Cultural Tourism Exhibition, the Fourth and Fifth China Expo of Traditional Skills of Intangible Cultural Heritage, and participated in the shooting of documentaries and promotional films such as \"the Art of Printing\" and \"Dongyuan Wooden Movable-type Printing\" for the promotion of the element and related historical and cultural knowledge. The bearers set up more than 20 experience halls all over the country. Thematic inns, restaurants and camps were opened in Pingyangkeng Town, Rui'an City, which helped create more practice opportunities for the bearers and their income was improved; public respect for the bearers was enhanced, and more young people were attracted to get involved in the transmission and practice of the element.\n\nB.3.c.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nDescribe how communities, groups or, if appropriate, individuals as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have effectively participated, including in terms of gender roles, in the safeguarding measures. Describe the role of the implementing organization or body (name, background, etc.) and the human resources that were available for implementing safeguarding activities.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nRelevant communities, groups, individuals and non-governmental organizations have played a major role in the implementation of various safeguarding measures.\n\nThe representative bearers Wang Chuanqiao, Wang Zhiren, Wu Kuizhao and Wang Fawan consciously assumed their responsibility in the transmission, practice and development of the element by training apprentices, exploring ways to expand the scope of practice, and carrying out promotion and demonstration activities. For example, Wang Chuanqiao, Wang Zhiren and Wang Fawan were invited to teach at the training workshops; Wang Chuanqiao was engaged in the integration of the element with woodblock printing and bamboo paper making techniques; Wang Fawan opened an experience hall. Female practitioners have been increasingly involved in all aspects of the element; Ms. Wu Shumei was identified as the representative bearer.\n\nLocal communities still regarded movable-type printing as an important choice for the compiling and printing of clan genealogies; they voluntarily participated in the practice of the element with self-raised funds. For example, the Miao family of Xiyang Village, Anyang Street of Rui'an City, actively implemented the \"the Standards for Genealogy Compiling and Editing in Rui'an City (Trial)\", and entrusted Wang Chaoxi, the representative bearer, to revise its genealogy. Dongyuan Village of Pingyangkeng Town in Rui'an City, as the main community where the element is transmitted, improved the local infrastructure to bring convenience to the life and work of the bearers. The community in Anyang neighborhood in Rui'an City organized regular experience activities for local residents on its premises.\n\nRui'an Movable-type Printing Association served as the coordinator between the bearers and local governments, communities, enterprises and research institutes; it held training workshops, conducted educational activities in cooperation with schools, organized the bearers to participate in exhibitions and promotional activities, and reported on the safeguarding performance on a yearly basis. Experts from the Folk Artists Association and the Arts and Crafts Association jointly formed a group to provide intellectual support for the identification of bearers and the transmission activities. Rui'an Movable-type Printing Exhibition Hall and Experiential Learning Hall received a total of 131,000 visitors from all walks of life from 2019 to 2022, contributing greatly to the promotion and demonstration of the element. Rui'an Surname Culture Research Association carried out genealogical culture research, and was engaged in editing and compiling genealogies as entrusted by the clans.\n\nRelevant communities and groups, governments at all levels and competent bodies have input about 49,000 people accumulatively in the safeguarding of the element.\n\nB.3.d.\n\nTimetable\n\nIndicate in a timetable when each activity was implemented.\n\nTimetable\n\nThe regular safeguarding activities include: providing financial support for the representative bearers at all levels to take apprentices and carry out transmission and practice activities; organizing educational activities in Rui'an Kaiyuan Vocational School and Zhejiang Industry & Trade Vocational College; holding exhibitions, experiential learning, and lectures on the element in Rui'an Movable-type Printing Exhibition Hall, and local community in Anyang, Rui'an City, and exploring ways to further expand the scope of practice of the element apart from the compiling and printing of clan genealogies.\n\nThe timetable for other specific safeguarding activities:\n\n• In 2020 and 2021, Rui'an Movable-type Printing Association held training workshops once a year.\n\n• In January 2021, one representative bearer was identified by Zhenjiang Province.\n\n• In May 2022, five representative bearers were identified by Rui'an City.\n\n• From 2019 to 2022, documents and recordings were digitalized and archived; the Chinese movable-type printing webpage was set up.\n\n• From 2020 to 2022, academic activities such as \"China (Rui'an) Movable-type Printing Transmission & Development Seminar\" and \"Academic Seminar on Movable-type Printing\" were held and related research results were released.

The following improvements have been realized.\n\nThe community-centered multiple actors have taken coordinated efforts and led to positive results. Bearers, relevant associations and organizations, educational institutes, experts and scholars, and governments at all levels, have played their respective advantages and taken synergistic actions to sustain the viability of the element which is taken as the common goal. The communities, groups and individuals concerned have been fully involved, mobilized, and taken the essential role in the safeguarding of the element.\n\nThe financing channels have become more diversified, and the use of funds been effectively supervised. Government inputs at all levels have remained as the major source of capital and guarantee for the safeguarding of the element, and the proportion of communities' input has been on the rise. In addition, efforts have been made to involve other social forces in the safeguarding activities. To ensure an efficient use of funds and thrift, open and transparent supervision methods have been adopted, for instance, to further specify the scopes and approaches to use the financial support for bearers' teaching activities and practice; the council of clan elders has been set up to take care of fund management and supervision.\n\nThe safeguarding measures have been effectively implemented. The past experience has shown the positive results that on-going training workshops can bring about. For example, the five newly identified representative bearers during this reporting period are mostly the registered apprentices and beneficiaries of the training workshops. Therefore, more training workshops will be provided in the next reporting period. The archives of the element have been greatly enriched through digitalization of documents and recordings. The research results on the element and its safeguarding are gradually increasing and have been applied to the safeguarding activities, as indicated by the formulation and pilot implementation of \"the Standards for the Genealogy Compiling and Editing in Rui'an City (Trial)\".\n\nFurther improvement will be made in the following aspects: to expand training and teaching content to build up bearers' knowledge storage including the genealogical culture; to apply more digital means to various safeguarding activities; to enhance the engagement of the bearers in the research of the element and its safeguarding, and promote the application of more research outcomes in the safeguarding activities.\n\nC\n\nZhu\n\nC.

Nowadays, with the popularity of modern printing technology, the viability of the element has been seriously endangered, and its transmission has been in a predicament. The inscription of the element on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding in November 2010 (Decision 5.COM 5.2) has triggered discussions among Chinese people about intangible cultural heritage and their viability in the modern times. In this process, the public become increasingly aware of the importance of safeguarding intangible cultural heritage to the promotion of cultural diversity and human creativity. In particular, the communities, groups, and individuals concerned renewed their understanding of the element and its related folk custom and cultural space. The solidarity and cultural identification of the local communities were strengthened, and the visibility of the element and that of intangible cultural heritage in general were also promoted.\n\nDuring the last reporting period, the safeguarding measures implemented and their effectiveness were confirmed by the Committee (Decision12.COM 8.c.7). It was pointed out in this Decision that, through establishing audio-visual documentation, providing capital support for bearers and practicing institutions, the State Party made positive efforts in safeguarding the element. In the current reporting period, in order to ensure the viability of the element, joint efforts were made between relevant communities, groups and individuals, and the competent bodies and Chinese governments at all levels. The safeguarding measures were implemented in deep cooperation among the above-mentioned stakeholders:\n\n(1) The bearers were encouraged to take on apprentices to activate the internal vitality of the traditional modes of transmission. The neighboring communities were also mobilized and encouraged to be involved in practicing the movable-type printing technique. At present, 17 bearers commanding the whole process of the technique were identified as representative bearers. In addition, the number of practitioners directly involved in the transmission of the technique was about 240. Compared with the situation before the inscription, the number of bearers commanding the whole process of the technique was increased by 15, and the number of practitioners directly involved in the practice of the technique was increased by more than 130 (including 23 females).\n\n(2) In response to Decision 12.COM 8.c.7, in strengthening the role of school education and transmission bases in the transmission of the element, relevant stakeholders continued to support three teaching bases (Kaiyuan Vocational Secondary School, Rui’an Pingyangkeng School and Rui’an Ma’anshan Experimental Primary School) and one transmission center (Wang Chuanqiao Wooden Movable-type Printing Handicraft Studio) during the reporting period, which aimed at ensuring the intergenerational transmission of the element through formal and informal education. In addition, Kaiyuan Vocational Secondary School was included in the second batch of the “Zhejiang List of ICH Teaching and Transmission Bases”, and was proclaimed “Zhejiang Advanced Unit for Popularization and Education of Traditional Culture”. Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association was included in the second batch of “ICH Safeguarding-through-Production Base” in Zhejiang Province.\n\n(3) Such non-governmental organizations as Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association carried out training sessions for bearers and practitioners to promote the teaching and exchange of the technique. Two training workshops were respectively held in 2016 and 2018, with 38 apprentices in total participated. The Association continued to engage in the business printing editions of ancient books since 2015. By using the movable-type printing technique, it also printed important ancient books such as Doha and etc. The viability of the element was promoted through the market-oriented operation and management.\n\n(4) The Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall was repaired and expanded to accommodate richer exhibits, objects and tools. Safeguarding measures regarding the preservation of ancient buildings in Dongyuan was confirmed and implemented. The Dongyuan Village was further developed into a community-based traditional cultural transmission base. As a result, the visibility of the element was promoted, the public’s recognition and understanding over it and its related cultural space and folklore were deepened, more and more people were summoned and became voluntarily involved in the safeguarding of ICH in general.\n\nA.7.\n\nContact person for correspondence\n\nProvide the name, address and other contact information of the person responsible for correspondence concerning the report.\n\nTitle (Ms/Mr, etc.)\n\nMr\n\nFamily name\n\nZHENG\n\nGiven name\n\nJianjun\n\nInstitution/position\n\nCenter for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province, China / Directorhanges and Cooperation Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China\n\nAddress\n\nFL-4 Cultural Center, No. 8 Jiefang Zhonglu Road, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325200\n\nTelephone number\n\n0086-577-65877058\n\nE-mail address\n\nrasfy@sina.com\n\nOther relevant information\n\nwww.muhuozi.com (website for Wooden movable-type printing of China)\n\nB\n\nMs\n\nB. Status of element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List\n\nRefer to the nomination file or to previous reports, if any, as the basis for reporting on the current status of the element, and report only on relevant changes since the date of inscription on the List or since the previous report. Nomination files, specific timetables and earlier reports, if any, are available at https://ich.unesco.org or from the Secretariat, upon request.\n\nThe State Party shall pay special attention to the role of gender and shall endeavour to ensure the widest possible participation of the communities, groups and, where applicable, individuals concerned as well as relevant non-governmental organizations during the process of preparing this report, and is asked to describe how it has done so in point D below.\n\nB.1.\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nPlease explain the social and cultural functions and meanings of the element today, within and for its community, the characteristics of the bearers and practitioners, and any specific roles or categories of persons with special responsibilities towards the element, among others. Attention should be given to any relevant changes related to inscription criterion U.1 (‘the element constitutes intangible cultural heritage as defined in Article 2 of the Convention’).\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nMovable-type printing technique is considered by the communities, groups, and individuals concerned as an important part of their cultural heritage. For the bearers, it is not only the technique transmitted from generation to generation within family, but also the important means for livelihood. The technique is mainly used in the compiling and printing of clan genealogies in local communities to record the history and kinship of their families. Therefore, as the carrier of the local history and culture, the movable-type printing technique not only provides technical support for the transmission of local culture, but also functions as an important media to maintain the inter-generational connection among the community members. Having spread to other areas in China, the element plays an important role in the social and cultural development of these places, and becomes an important cultural carrier for different groups to understand and recognize their history.\n\nThe essence of movable-type printing technique originates from the process where certain cultural and artistic concepts are updated and transmitted, and from the process where a scientific and practical system of technique is passed down from one generation to the next. Although the technique system has relatively fixed patterns and matured production processes, there is no standardized working models to be followed, which provides enough room for different communities, groups, and individuals to give full play to their creativity. The technique is mainly transmitted from bearers to their apprentices within families. A special ceremony for taking on apprentices is strictly abided. Individuals should be recognized by the local community before becoming a bearer in the system of intergenerational transmission. Decision 12.COM 8.c.7 pointed out that, the role of bearers in the development of the element should be emphasized and attached with great importance. Craftsmen engaged in the technique are not only experts of traditional printing techniques, but also bearers of Chinese genealogical culture. They are responsible for the editing, printing, and binding of different clan genealogies. Therefore, they are also known as the “Masters of Genealogy”. Generally speaking, women practitioners are weaker in strength, so they mainly work on the typesetting, printing, and binding, and so on. Wu Shumei, the daughter-in-law of Wang Chuanqiao, is a representative bearer of the element. Since 2017, she has overcome physical limitations of the female and started to learn engraving and other techniques used to be practiced mainly by male bearers. Through constant efforts, these female bearers have basically grasped the whole process of wooden movable-type printing technique and become an important force among the representative bearers of the element.\n\nAt present, the communities in which the element is being practiced and transmitted include the old areas of Dongyuan Village of Gaolou Town and Xiqian Village of Caocun Town in Rui’an City, as well as some adjacent and new areas such as Pingyang County. In these communities, representative bearers such as Wang Chaohui, Lin Chuyin, Wang Chuanqiao and Wang Zhiren continue to work on the printing, revision, compiling and preservation of clan genealogies for local communities. The above-mentioned representative bearers have carried out regular teaching activities on movable-type printing technique in middle and primary schools. By teaching the historical and cultural knowledge associated with the element to the students, these representative bearers continue to play an indispensable role in the safeguarding and transmission of the element.\n\nB.2.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nPlease describe the current level of viability of the element, particularly the frequency and extent of its practice, the strength of traditional modes of transmission, the demographics of practitioners and audiences and its sustainability. Please also identify and describe the threats, if any, to the element's continued transmission and enactment and describe the severity and immediacy of such threats, giving particular attention to any strengthening or weakening of the element’s viability subsequent to inscription.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nCurrent level of viability of the element\n\n(1) Within the communities where the element is viable, the element still functions culturally in commemorating ancestors, transmitting history, and continuing identification. Thus, there are still comparatively great demands in the markets of Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places. For example, bearers in Dongyuan Village received more than 150 orders in 2016. The payment for these orders relied on the scale of the clan genealogy, and the annual income of a bearer was about 60,000 to 80,000 RMB, which was slightly increased and close to the average annual salary of a local skilled worker. This is in a sense helpful to the stabilization of local bearers and to the ensuring of the viability of the element.\n\n(2) After inscription, the local communities, NGOs, and governmental institutions actively supported folk clans to conduct research on their genealogies, aiming at expanding the range for the application of movable-type printing technique. As a result, the market demand for the technique was in fact increased. In practice, community members also voluntarily used the technique to compile and print clan genealogies to ensure the frequency of its practice, thus ensuring the actual function of the element in the communal cultural system.\n\n(3) In addition to the compiling and printing of clan genealogies, the publication of more ancient books further increased the practice frequency of the element and promoted its viability. For example, the local governments entrusted the Movable-type Printing Association to edit and publish 26 types of ancient books. Relevant communities were encouraged by the initiative and sought to sustain the cultural tradition through regular compiling and printing clan genealogies. As a result, a total of 31,000 books (as of December 2018, 1,000 to 3,000 copies for each type) were printed and for sale in bookshops. Some of the books were presented as gifts in foreign exchange. This further expanded the range of application for the movable-type printing technique.\n\n(4) Representative bearers actively developed souvenirs related to the wooden movable-type printing technique, which effectively increased the number of related bearers and practitioners. For example, Wang Chuanqiao founded his Wooden Movable-type Printing Handicraft Studio in Dongyuan Village in 2013, which not only increased the number of apprentices and practice frequency of the element, but also raised the income of relevant practitioners and bearers.\n\nCurrent risks to the element\n\n(1) The traditional craftsmanship is under the impact of the modern technology and struggles in the contemporary social context. Considering the cost, many clans gave up movable-type printing technique for the relatively cost-saving computer digital printing in revising and compiling clan genealogies. As a result, the traditional market for the technique shrank and was occupied by the new technology. For example, in the past five years, more than 20 clan genealogies in Rui’an were printed with the computer digital printing, which was about 5% higher in number compared to the previous level.\n\n(2) Movable-type printing technique is of complicated process with high technical contents. The bearer should not only master certain knowledge about the history and culture of the element, but also learn and practice brush handwriting of Chinese calligraphy and hand-operated engraving techniques. It usually takes at least two years for an apprentice to command the whole set of movable-type printing technique. Due to the utilitarian oriented values and rapid rhythm of development in modern society, together with the lack of incentives and securing mechanism, the young people are generally not interested in the safeguarding of the element.\n\n(3) At present, movable-type printing technique is mostly used in rural areas. Although the payment is higher than before, it still remains at a comparatively low level. Therefore, some craftsmen need to do part-time jobs, or even change career, which restrains the sustainable development of the element.\n\n(4) Currently, there are 17 representative bearers who master the whole set of movable-type printing technique (four have passed away since last reporting period). All of them are middle-aged or elderly people above 50 years old. The viability of the element may be further endangered in the future.\n\nB.3.\n\nImplementation of safeguarding measures\n\nPlease report on the safeguarding measures described in the nomination file, and previous report, if any. Describe how they have been implemented and how they have substantially contributed to the safeguarding of the element during the reporting period, taking note of external or internal constraints such as limited resources. Include, in particular, information on the measures taken to ensure the viability of the element by enabling the community to continue to practise and transmit it. Include the following detailed information concerning the implementation of the set of safeguarding measures or safeguarding plan:\n\nB.3.a.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nIndicate what primary objective(s) were addressed and what concrete results were attained during the reporting period.\n\nObjectives and results\n\n(1) The safeguarding of the bearers: to continue the existing national mechanism of four-level (county, municipal, provincial and national levels) identification and recognition of representative bearers. A total of 17 representative bearers of movable-type printing technique were identified (including one departed bearer). About 240 people directly participated in the practice, including over 50 females (one of them was qualified to be identified as the representative bearer). Female practitioners played important roles in the transmission of the element, which was a positive signal for its sustainable development. In addition, Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Company in Rui’an continued to support relevant bearers for the production, practice and transmission of the element, and to improve its practice frequency through market-oriented management and sale.\n\n(2) Promoting visibility: to continue supporting Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association to construct two teaching bases for the transmission of the element. Rui’an Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall was renovated and enlarged, and relevant historical antiquities, visual materials and on-spot demonstration sessions were added to the existing layout. As the Transmission Base of ICH and the Education Base of Traditional Culture in Wenzhou City, the Hall housed a series of exhibitions, which not only contributed to the promotion of the visibility of the element, but to that of the ICH in general among the public.\n\n(3) Documentation: since 2016, on the basis of the general investigation over the communities and bearers concerned, the cultural eco-environment of the element, editions of ancient books, and etc., the modern digital technology was applied to record and preserve the core factors of the element such as the printing processe, folklore, taboos and tools. 486 G of videos, 6,560 M of photos, 308 M of texts, and more than 120 pieces of other materials were collected.\n\n(4) Institutional Support: The Rui’an Center for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was directly in charge of safeguarding the element. By clarifying relevant rights, obligations, and responsibilities, the Steering Group for Safeguarding Movable-type Printing Technique in Rui’an played a coordinative role ensuring the effective implementation and supervision of relevant safeguarding measures.\n\n(5) Legislation: The Intangible Cultural Heritage Law of the People’s Republic of China, and the Regulations on Safeguarding ICH of Zhejiang Province, provided a legal basis for the implementation of the safeguarding measures proposed. Meanwhile, based on the local context, Rui’an City also drew up the specific guidelines to facilitate the safeguarding of the element, which substantially based the safeguarding work on the laws or regulations.\n\nB.3.b.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nList the key activities that were carried out during this reporting period in order to achieve these expected results. Please describe the activities in detail and note their effectiveness or any problems encountered in implementing them.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nFocusing on bearers and increasing the frequency of practice\n\n(1) The representative bearers were identified on the basis of the recommendation of the communities concerned. In order to improve their income and stimulate their enthusiasm to practice and transmit the element, governments at different levels provided financial support for the bearers. In addition, some assistance was also provided in terms of venues, reduction or exemption of taxes, financial loans, and administrative examination and approval.\n\n(2) General investigation on the element was organized, and archives were established with modern multimedia technology. The viability of movable-type printing technique was evaluated by experts with the participation of the communities and bearers concerned. Through the complete documentation incorporating audio, visual, and textual materials, the historical development, the status of transmission, as well as other important information, were further confirmed.\n\n(3) Training workshops were organized at the education and transmission base every two years. The transmission of the element and the training of the next generation of masters were centered around the representative bearers concerned. Rui’an Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall and Wang Chuanqiao Wooden Movable-type Printing Handicraft Studio organized a number of transmission activities. Meanwhile, they developed tourist souvenirs using cultural factors of the element, which in a way created opportunities for the apprentices to practice. Moreover, the income of relevant bearers was correspondingly increased, and more job opportunities were created for the local communities.\n\n(4) Through the cooperation with the local government, taking advantage of various state-oriented projects to publish hard copies of ancient books, the practice frequency of the element, as well as its relevance to the social needs, were promoted. 15 important ancient books, including the Art of War, were reprinted since 2011. This not only provided an opportunity for the bearers and practitioners concerned to practice the element, but also promoted the influence and visibility of the element.\n\nDissemination and education\n\n(1) From June to July every year, bearers were organized to participate in on-site activities on Rui’an Cultural Heritage Day to demonstrate the whole process of movable-type printing technique. They were also organized to participate in the ICH exhibition and exchange activities in other places, such as the thematic exhibition “Cultural Transmission and Future Prospect - Diversified Interaction between Chinese Movable-Type Printing and Modern Chinese Characters Ink Painting” held in Australia in December 2018, which further extended the influence of the element and attracted more attention from the public. On-site demonstrations by bearers and experiencing projects for visitors were added as well, in order to promote movable-type printing technique in the society.\n\n(2) Various kinds of activities to introduce movable-type printing technique into campuses were organized, and teaching bases for the transmission of movable-type printing technique were established at middle and primary schools. Popular textbooks such as Movable-type Printing Technique in Dongyuan of Rui’an and Movable-type Printing Technique in Rui’an were adopted in the teaching of wooden movable-type printing technique at middle and primary schools, which improved the awareness of the importance of safeguarding ICH among young people.\n\n(3) More than 200 pieces of news were released in different media. 10 thematic TV documentaries were broadcast since 2015, giving extensive introduction and dissemination of the element. This had a good social impact in the public and further strengthened the public opinion to support the safeguarding of the element.\n\n(4) Through platforms and occasions such as the national Cultural and Natural Heritage Day, the UNESCO’s 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and relevant national laws and regulations were highlighted and introduced. As a result, the awareness of the importance of safeguarding intangible cultural heritage among the public was promoted. The attention of the public was further attracted to the safeguarding of the element and ICH in general.\n\n(5) To explore the sustainable development of the element and improve the visibility of the element among the academic community, and to provide intellectual support for the theoretical research and safeguarding of the element, the “China Rui’an Movable-type Printing Technique Seminar” was continually held. Coordinated by China Movable-type Printing Technique Expert Committee, extensive cooperation with colleges and folk-art associations was established to intellectually support the long-term safeguarding and development of the element.\n\nProblems to be solved\n\n(1) Lack of investment, the form of fund-raising remains simplex. Since the financial support for the safeguarding mainly comes from government investment, diversified fund-raising channels need to be explored. In addition to government investment, at the level of community and civil organization, their ways of contribution to the safeguarding of the element rely on providing human power or in-kind support. At present, only a few representative bearers like Wang Chuanqiao have the capability to raise funds on their own by developing and selling handicrafts or souvenirs related to the element. Other bearers can only rely on limited social and government support to continue their transmission and practice.\n\n(2) The local competent bodies lack of relevant experiences in safeguarding the element, and the measures taken remain simplex. Currently, progress has been made by organizing thematic exhibitions of representative works for relevant bearers at the local exhibition halls and museums, which to an extent has improved the bearers’ income and stimulated their enthusiasm in the safeguarding efforts. However, influence still remains insignificant due to limited exposure. For the next stage, more funds should be provided in collecting the representative works of bearers and the size and frequency of the thematic exhibition should be increased. In addition, government could explore more diversified safeguarding methodology such as: drawing up relevant rules and setting up a rewarding mechanism to encourage social organizations to invest in the safeguarding; providing positions in the government for those apprentices of superb skills.\n\n(3) The safeguarding measures lack of diversified methodologies, and the sustainable development of the element lacks of institutional guarantee. For young bearers (most of them are apprentices of identified bearers), they could hardly be identified as representative bearers due to the limited time in practicing the technique and their age. Therefore, it is difficult to work out the standard or procedure to provide them with financial aids (as the compensation for their work), which results in a fact that less young people especially the females are attracted to the safeguarding of the element. In addition, there is still no corresponding mechanism to encourage and guarantee the folk organizations (mainly the Clan Genealogy Compiling Committee) to use the element in the compiling and printing of clan genealogies.\n\nB.3.c.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nDescribe how communities, groups or, if appropriate, individuals as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have effectively participated, including in terms of gender roles, in the safeguarding measures. Describe the role of the implementing organization or body (name, background, etc.) and the human resources that were available for implementing safeguarding activities.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nRui’an Movable-type Printing Association is a NGO founded voluntarily by the bearers and practitioners of the wooden movable-type printing technique. Currently, it has more than 130 members. Taking advantage of its large number of members, the association took many measures for the safeguarding and transmission of the element. For example, it purchased the raw materials and used the wooden movable-type technique to print hard copies of ancient books. It also organized activities to enhance the internal communication among the bearers. In January 2017, the Association was listed on the second batch of “ICH Safeguarding-through-Production Base” in Zhejiang.\n\nThe community member Wu Xiaohuai has been engaged in the research of wooden movable-type printing technique for a long time. In 2017, he was entrusted by the government to lead the decoration of the newly built Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall. Through the event, the safeguarding efforts and research results of the element were fully demonstrated and represented in visual, textual and in-kind forms.\n\nThe website of movable-type printing technique in China (www.muhuozi.com) hosted by Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association maintains normal operation. It covers 10 columns, including “introduction to the association”, “latest news”, “history of the technique”, “feature of the technique”, “business scope”, “bearers”, “exhibition and impact”, “transmission and safeguarding”, “members of the association” and “message board”. The website continues to play an important role in the dissemination and promotion of the element.\n\nThe members of China Movable-type Printing Technique Expert Committee mainly consist of the members from the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association. All of them are local experts, who are responsible for the evaluation of ICH, as well as facilitating the identification of representative bearers and the transmission of the element.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, a total of 126,000 visitors and professionals from the country and abroad visited the Rui’an Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall. The development of cultural tourism and creative souvenirs, provided opportunities for the apprentices to practice, thus improving bearers’ income and creating more jobs for the local community.\n\nAs competent bodies, the Bureau of Culture, Radio, TV, Film, Press and Publication in Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province and the Center for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province, play a coordinative role in the implementation of the safeguarding measures. Nearly 48,000 people from relevant communities, groups, government at all levels and competent bodies, are involved in the safeguarding of the element.\n\nB.3.d.\n\nTimetable\n\nIndicate in a timetable when each activity was implemented.\n\nTimetable\n\nGovernmental resources\n\n2015-2018: filming documentaries of movable-type printing technique (30,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: collecting information and images of movable-type printing technique (20,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: financial aid for representative bearers (300,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: making brochures for the publicity of movable-type printing technique (50,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: financial aid for bearers (140,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: participating in cultural fairs and other domestic activities (90,000 RMB)\n\n2015-2018: financial aid for transmission of books made by the Movable-type Printing Technique (95,000 RMB)\n\nApril 2016: organizing the movable-type printing technique competition and evaluation of apprentices training (10,000 RMB)\n\n2016-2017: building the new movable-type printing technology exhibition hall (4,100,000 RMB)\n\n2017-2018: renovating the old movable-type printing technology exhibition hall (1,500,000 RMB)\n\n2016-2018: purchasing equipment for the transmission of movable-type printing technique (180,000 RMB)\n\n2016-2018: purchasing equipment for establishing archive and database (100,000 RMB)\n\n2017: organizing the first Wooden Movable-Type Printing Culture and Tourism Festival (180,000 RMB)\n\nTotal: 6,795,000 RMB\n\nOther resources\n\n2016-2018: organizing transmission and safeguarding activities by Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association (160,000 RMB raised by members)\n\n2016-2018: establishing teaching bases and opening training classes for the transmission of the element (50,000 RMB;

Please indicate how the activities contributed to achieving the results and whether other activities could have contributed better to achieving the same results. Also indicate whether the same results could have been achieved with less funding, whether the human resources available were appropriate and whether communities, groups and individuals could have been better involved.\n\nOverall effectiveness of the safeguarding activities\n\n(1) The rescuing recording and digital preservation of the element were successfully conducted, yielding fruitful achievements in documentation. A large amount of textual, visual, and audio information was collected and processed, especially the full records of the core components, technical process and characteristics, folk taboo and tools of the element, providing a solid basis of the thematic database under construction.\n\n(2) The channels for raising funds are more diversified and fund utilization is more effectively supervised by all stakeholders. Governments at all levels, relevant communities, groups and bearers applied the safeguarding-through-production methodology, focusing mainly on printing works with the wooden movable-type printing technique. More than 100 clan genealogies or copies of ancient books were printed annually. Although different clans kept the tradition to revise their clan genealogies regularly for a long time, the revision of each clan varied in the period, range and quantity. Therefore, the channels for raising funds for the safeguarding of the element were diversified. When every time the clan genealogy was to be revised, a Council of Clan Elders would be established, which was responsible for managing and supervising the use of the fund to ensure its efficiency and avoid waste. In addition, the printed copies of clan genealogies needed to be examined by the Council, which in fact guaranteed the high quality of these copies.\n\n(3) The number of bearers and practitioner increased. More people got involved in the safeguarding activities. Representative bearers are provided with financial aid and subsidies, as well as venues for transmission to stabilize the existing traditional transmission model and groups of bearers. Although the financial aid has been greatly increased, the effect is not satisfactory. It is suggested to further increase investment and subsidies in representative bearers.\n\n(4) Through dissemination, education and popularization of the element, its visibility was correspondingly promoted. More and more people became known about the element. Currently, limited investment achieved satisfactory results. For the next step, this successful experience should be followed. In addition, measures such as introducing ICH into communities and schools, compiling local textbooks, publishing monographs, shooting films and documentaries, and etc., were proved effective in promoting the visibility of the element. Experiences as such indeed contributed to the awareness raising among the public, disseminating knowledge about the element, and creating a good atmosphere in the society. Nevertheless, attention should be paid to the exploration of new channels and methods in the dissemination of the element.\n\n(5) The extensive participation of non-governmental industrial organizations and professional institutions has increased the efficiency in the comprehensive utilization of different resources. Institutes of higher learning and social organizations have participated in the safeguarding efforts by implementing various kinds of academic exchange and establishing the mechanism for providing scientific basis for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage. Although certain achievements have been made in the safeguarding work, we should still further sum up the experience and establish norms to ensure the targeted safeguarding and improve the efficiency in comprehensive utilization of different resources.\n\nC\n\nZhu\n\nC. Update of the safeguarding measures\n\nC.1.\n\nUpdated safeguarding plan\n\nPlease provide an update of the safeguarding plan included in the nomination file or in the previous report. In particular provide detailed information as follows:\n\na. What primary objective(s) will be addressed and what concrete results will be expected?\n\nb. What are the key activities to be carried out in order to achieve these expected results? Describe the activities in detail and in their best sequence, addressing their feasibility.\n\nc. How will the State(s) Party(ies) concerned support the implementation of the updated safeguarding plan?\n\nUpdated safeguarding plan\n\n(1) To collect the representative works of bearers and organize thematic exhibitions at local exhibition halls and museums, and to promote the enthusiasm of bearers and increase their income. Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall has paid Wang Chaohui, Wang Chuanqiao, Wu Kuizhao and other bearers, for collecting their representative works exhibited in the new Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall. The Hall even keeps a regular and long-term session for them to present their works. This widely praised action attracts a large number of tourists, experts and scholars, and the exhibition even becomes an eye-catching event of the Hall. Meanwhile, Rui’an Museum also provided special funds and venues to organize exhibitions of the representative bearers’ works. These new efforts would not only enhance the influence and visibility of the element, but greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the bearers and increase their income.\n\n(2) To develop apprentice training mechanism, enlarge the team of bearers, and secure the dynamic transmission mode of the element. Movable-type printing technique training workshops will be organized every two years by Rui’an Center for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage and Rui’an Movable-Type Printing Association, aiming at enlarging the team of bearers. Each training session will last three months. Apprentices of representative bearers in Rui’an city, students from middle and primary schools who are willing to learn the technique, and teachers who teach movable-type printing classes in schools, will be the targeted audiences of the training. Representative bearers including Wang Chuanqiao and Wang Zhiren will serve as key lecturers for the demonstration of the whole process of the element including calligraphy, engraving, typesetting, printing and bookbinding. Rui’an Center for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage will also sign agreements with each representative bearer to take apprentice, stipulating that every representative must ensure at least one of their apprentices takes the training courses. Based on past experiences---the first training workshop (October 2016 - January 2017) had 20 participants and the second (July 2018 - October 2018) had 18 participants (including 11 middle and primary school students), this mechanism is proved effective and will be followed in the next stage of the implementation.\n\n(3) To explore the possibility of promoting the dynamic transmission of the element through marketization. Wang Chuanqiao and his daughter-in-law successfully developed cultural creative products by combining wooden movable printing technique and block printing technique. Wang Fawan, the 34th generation of Dongyuan wooden movable-type printing technique, opened five experiencing centers in Dongyuan and Rui’an. These cases offer beneficiary experiences for the dynamic transmission of the element through marketization. Following the same idea, it is planned to develop relevant cultural creative products related to the element, and to promote their sales through internet. It is hoped that the overall profit of practicing the element will be increased, and the relevance of the element to the current social context will be strengthened through market- oriented operations.\n\n(4) To explore the innovation to integrate three elements: movable-type printing, Zhima wood block printing technique and Pingzhi paper making technique, and to develop relevant handcrafts and artworks. The issue of the integration of the three elements extensively attracts the public’s attention and triggers comprehensive discussions at the local level. After months of efforts, Wang Chuanqiao and other representative bearers from Rui’an and Ouhai successfully printed ancient-style Wenzhou pictures on the pingzhi paper. Such case provides new scenario for the safeguarding of the movable-type printing technique. New ways of the creative integration of different ICH elements will be explored, which aims at enhancing the added value of relevant ICH products and ensuring the viability of relevant ICH elements.\n\n(5) To provide institutional guarantee, including the rewarding and encouraging mechanism, for various stakeholders to be involved in the safeguarding of the element. Wenzhou and Rui’an municipal governments will ensure the implementation of relevant laws and regulations. For those bearers who pay their apprentices will be encouraged and rewarded by the local government. In addition, various social stakeholders will be encouraged to support and invest in the safeguarding of the element.\n\n(6) Chinese governments at all levels will make greater efforts to safeguard the element. On the basis of more than 3,000,000 RMB the previous expenditure, it is planned to invest at least 300,000 RMB each year to ensure the transmission and development of the element.\n\nC.2.\n\nTimetable for future actitivies\n\nProvide a timetable for the updated safeguarding plan (within a time-frame of approximately four years).\n\n00302,00303,00304,00305,00321,00530\n\nTimetable\n\nGovernmental Resources: 1,700,000 RMB\n\n2016-2020: holding three training workshops for wooden movable-type printing techniques (300,000 RMB)\n\n2018-2023: financial subsidies for the young and middle-aged representative bearers (about 400,000RMB)\n\n2018-2022: financial support for NGOs (such as the Clan Genealogy Council) relating to the safeguarding of the element (1,000,000 RMB)\n\nOther Resources: 3,600,000 RMB\n\n2018-2022: foundation of the integration of three elements:\n\nEstablishing a research institute (500,000 RMB)\n\nProducing the Pingzhi paper (600,000 RMB)\n\nEngraving creative paintings (500,000 RMB)\n\nOrganizing relevant exhibitions and sales (800,000 RMB)\n\n2018-2022: establishing operating studios for the integration and development of wooden movable-type printing and block printing techniques; establishing research and experiencing centers of the element.\n\nTotal: 5,300,000 RMB\n\nC.3.\n\nBudget for future activities\n\nProvide the estimates of the funds required for implementing the updated safeguarding plan (if possible, in US dollars), identifying any available resources (governmental sources, in-kind community inputs, etc.).\n\nBudget\n\nGovernmental Resources: 1,700,000 RMB\n\n2016-2020: holding three training workshops for wooden movable-type printing techniques (300,000 RMB)\n\n2018-2023: financial subsidies for the young and middle-aged representative bearers (about 400,000RMB)\n\n2018-2022: financial support for NGOs (such as the Clan Genealogy Council) relating to the safeguarding of the element (1,000,000 RMB)\n\nOther Resources: 3,600,000 RMB\n\n2018-2022: foundation of the integration of three elements:\n\nEstablishing a research institute (500,000 RMB)\n\nProducing the Pingzhi paper (600,000 RMB)\n\nEngraving creative paintings (500,000 RMB)\n\nOrganizing relevant exhibitions and sales (800,000 RMB)\n\n2018-2022: establishing operating studios for the integration and development of wooden movable-type printing and block printing techniques; establishing research and experiencing centers of the element.\n\nTotal: 5,300,000 RMB\n\nC.4.\n\nCommunity participation\n\nPlease describe how communities, groups and individuals, as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have been involved, including in terms of gender roles, in updating the safeguarding plan, and how they will be involved in its implementation.\n\n00045\n\nCommunity participation\n\n(1) The bearers concerned were actively engaged in the update and implementation of the safeguarding measures. Since 2015, the representative bearers Wang Chaohui, Lin Chuyin, Wang Chuanqiao and Wang Zhiren not only devoted themselves in transmission and safeguarding activities organized by the Teaching Base, but also actively participated in symposiums organized by communities, groups and government for the update of the safeguarding plans. Their proposal of prepaying subsidies for the bearers was adopted by the government. In particular, Wang Chuanqiao had been teaching his daughter-in-law the movable-type printing technique since 2015, who was able to master the whole set of techniques including the extremely difficult engraving technique in 2018. They were both involved in the fieldwork and symposium held in Zeya Town (Ouhai District, Wenzhou City), which aimed at exploring the integration of the three elements. Wang Chaohui, Lin Chuyin and Wang Chuanqiao promised to continue to participate in the implementation of the updated safeguarding plans. They will play active roles in the teaching sessions to involve more people into the transmission of the element. In addition, by searching for more orders and increasing the income through practicing the element, they will try their best to place the transmission of the element on a more solid economic basis.\n\n(2) Communities and groups are the social and cultural foundation for the transmission of the element. Over the past three years, they were deeply involved in the safeguarding of the element in the following two aspects: 1) involvement in the update of the safeguarding plan on clan genealogies; 2) providing support and logistics for the training sessions. Taking Rui'an Movable-type Printing Association as a case, by taking the advantage of its large number of members and practitioners, it substantially promoted the implementation of the safeguarding and transmission plan: purchasing high-quality timbers for professionals to engrave the type matrix; holding annual meetings and thematic conferences to report on the status quo of the element and awarding outstanding bearers and craftsmen; ensuring the normal operation of Dongyuan Movable-Type Printing Co., Ltd., and taking in orders to print the copies of ancient books.\n\n(3) Dongyuan Village, Pingyangkeng Town, Rui’an City actively cooperated with governments at all levels in the implementation of the safeguarding plan, by applying for more fund from the local government, improving the transportation conditions of the Village as a core area of the element, and creating a better living and working environment for the bearers concerned. Dongyuan Village and Rui'an Movable-type Printing Association promised they will continue to try their best to contribute to the safeguarding and transmission of the element. Zhejiang and Rui’an governments promised they will further strengthen the current safeguarding efforts; On the basis of the existing expenditure of 3,000,000 RMB, at least another 400,000 RMB special fund will be invested each year to ensure the transmission and development of the element.\n\nC.5.\n\nInstitutional context\n\nPlease report on the institutional context for the local management and safeguarding of the element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List, including:\n\na. the competent body(ies) involved in its management and/or safeguarding;\n\nb. the organization(s) of the community or group concerned with the element and its safeguarding.\n\n2004-12-02\n\nInstitutional context\n\na. the competent bodies involved in its management and/or safeguarding\n\n(1) Bureau of Culture, Radio, TV, Film, Press and Publication, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province\n\n(2) Center for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province\n\nb. organizations of the community or group concerned with the element and its safeguarding\n\n(1) Rui’an Movable-type Printing Association, Zhejiang Province\n\n(2) Dongyuan Movable-type Printing Company, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province\n\n(3) China Movable-type Printing Culture Exhibition Hall, Dongyuan, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province\n\n(4) Wang Chuanqiao Wooden Movable-type Printing Handicraft Studio\n\n(5) Kaiyuan Vocational Secondary School, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province\n\n(6) Ma‘anshan Experimental Primary School, Rui"
