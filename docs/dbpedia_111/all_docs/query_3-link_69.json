        "text": "Answer: 500 characters is between 71 words and 125 words with spaces included in the character count. If spaces are not included in the character count, then 500 characters is between 83 words and 167 words.\n\nAccording to research by Miller, Newman, and Friedman, \"the average length of a function word was 3.13 letters; for a content word the average was 6.47 letters.\" To get the estimates above, we assumed that words in sentences range from 4-7 letters. We also assumed that sentences have 15-20 words and paragraphs typically have 100-200 words and 5-6 sentences.\n\nWhat Counts as 500 Characters?\n\nA character can be any letter, number, punctuation, special character, or space. Each of these characters takes up one byte of space in a computer's memory. Some Unicode characters, like emojis and some letters in non-Latin alphabets, take up two bytes of space and therefore count as two characters. Use our character counter tool below for an accurate count of your characters.\n\nHow Many Sentences Is 500 Characters?"
