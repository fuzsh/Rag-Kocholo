Inspired by a poem by the Chinese poet Shih Te (â€¦ - c. 730) â€˜Lonely Treeâ€™ is a new artwork in my collections â€˜Infinite Seaâ€™ and â€˜Digital Artworksâ€™, see the links in the first comment. It is a fusion and transformation of two photos of the North Sea; one made at the beach, one of a sunset seen from the hamlet where we lived close to the coast of North Jutland, Denmark. Wishing you a calm start of the new week ! ALL WE NEED IS LESS Through my artworks I ask you to reflect for a moment on the nature around you, on the beautiful feeling that nature can evoke, on your actions to support the wellbeing of the earth and everything that lives on it, on what HUMANITY loses when DEVELOPED COUNTRIES continue on the destructive path of ever more greed and CONSUMINGâ€¦ #fineartphotography #digitalart #poetry #naturessoul #AllYouNeedIsLess #RegenerativeLife #AlwaysGiveBackMoreThanWhatYouUsed Â© Jacob Berghoef FineArtPhotography This is a digital artwork, printed with high-quality ink on museum-quality, acid-free cotton/rag paper (HahnemÃ¼hle Photo RagÂ® 308gsm). The work comes in a limited edition of 10, signed and with a certificate of authenticity. Maximum size is 240Wx150H cm / 94Wx60H inches. For these digital artworks, I start with one or more photographs made by myself, which I edit in multiple process runs and in several layers by color manipulation and adding and editing multiple digital photographic effects, until a surrealistic atmosphere is created that touches me and tells the story I want to tell. The photograph I begin with has an impressionistic, surrealistic and/or abstract realist style, which is the basis for all my work.\n\nMisty Winter Morning Morning breaks over the silent world Clouds of mist rise from the fields, carrying the cold of a winter's night Early on a misty morning, I go out for a walk through the fields. Cold mist rises from the ground. At the edge of a lake, a group of pines welcome the light. 'Misty Winter Morning' is an artwork in my collections â€˜Wavy Fieldsâ€™ and 'Digital Art', see the links in the first comment. When working on a new artwork to accompany a poem written by Kari Trenten, I made an intermediate step in editing one of my earlier digital artworks into a \"watery cold atmosphere\" I liked the result so much that I did not edit it further first, resulting in this work. I've lost count as to how many process steps the original photo went through... ;) Early next week I will show you the final result of two more handfuls of edits, the work I made for Kari.
