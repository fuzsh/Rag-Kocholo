        "text": "SUBMIT ONLINE HERE.\n\nVISIT LINK ABOVE FOR COMPLETE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nSubmissions are accepted only in MS-Word format. Please submit your article and 150 word abstract in one file. Please be certain that no identifying information [i.e. the name(s), affiliation(s) of the author(s)] is submitted with the article. Tables, figures, and images should be uploaded as supplementary files at time of submission. A confirmation note will be sent to each scholar immediately after the submission is received. Once you have received this confirmation, please do not ask for further confirmation.\n\nWe recognize that access to the internet is not universal; therefore we will accommodate those who are unable to submit their manuscripts electronically. Please contact the editorial staff at: JWAH, 141B & 141C Old Horticulture, 506 E. Circle Drive, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824; Phone: (517) 884-4593, Fax: (517) 884-4594, or jwah@msu.edu for further instructions. The editor-in-chief can be reached directly at najwah@msu.edu.\n\nBOOK REVIEWS: Review essays (not exceeding 1,000 words) should engage the interpretation, meaning, or importance of an author’s argument for a wider scholarly audience. Justification for shorter or longer reviews should be discussed with the Book Review Editor prior to submission. Include your name and affiliation at the end of the review. Double space your document, with an extra space between paragraphs (rather than indenting each one). See style sheet below for book review formatting guidelines.\n\nClick here for a list of books available for review: https://jwah.msu.edu/book-reviews/.\n\nEDITORIAL POLICY\n\nAll articles submitted to JWAH must be original work that has not been published previously and is not currently under consideration by any other publication. All submissions to JWAH go through a double blind peer-review process. Response time is typically 3–4 months from submission. The article is first read in-house by an editor. If the submission meets the style, content, and quality requirement of JWAH, the editor-in-chief sends it out to two referees who are experts in the relevant field of research. If there is a consensus in the assessment of the article by the referees and the editor, their expressed decision is final. The editor-in-chief will only consult a third reviewer if there is a difference of opinion. The fact that JWAH requires a consensus view between the referees and an editor ensures that the process is as fair as possible. To ensure publication, authors must be available to respond to reviewers’ comments, make revisions, and review page proofs. A tentative schedule will be provided at time of submission acceptance.\n\nMANUSCRIPT PREPARATION\n\nJWAH follows the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed., and uses endnote-style citations. Refer to the JWAH style sheet to prepare your manuscript for submission.\n\nJWAH STYLE SHEET\n\nIMAGES AND DERIVATIVE MATERIALS\n\nIt is the author’s obligation and responsibility to determine and satisfy copyright and/or other use restrictions prior to submitting materials to MSU Press for publication.\n\nImages must be submitted as supplementary, clearly-labeled files at time of submission.\n\nAll images must be minimum 300 dpi at planned publication size.\n\nCitations, permissions, and captions are required upon submission for all images.\n\nWe cannot publish such materials without an accompanying signed permissions letter.\n\nJWAH Permission Request Letter\n\nPUBLISHING AGREEMENTS"
