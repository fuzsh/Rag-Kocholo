        "text": "Overview Approval Banter Romance\n\nAstarion Ancunín is an origin character and recruitable companion with the Charlatan background. He is a high elf and a Rogue first appearing during Act One.\n\nA vampire spawn previously under the control of Cazador Szarr until being abducted by the nautiloid, Astarion is set on getting revenge on Cazador and becoming free no matter what. He can be first found west of the Nautiloid Wreck during Act One, where he can be recruited into the party as well as romanced by characters of any gender.\n\n“\n\nAnd to think I was ready to decorate the ground with your innards. Apologies.\n\n„ — Astarion, apologising after a misunderstanding\n\nOverview[edit | edit source]\n\nBackground[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for two centuries in Baldur's Gate, enslaved by a sadistic vampire lord named Cazador Szarr until he was snatched away by the mind flayers on the Nautiloid and tadpoled. Now he can walk in the sunlight, wade through water, enter homes uninvited, and resist his master's compulsions. Astarion now has a chance at a new life where he can make his own choices, and possibly gain the true freedom and safety he so desperately seeks.\n\nStarting Class[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion starts as a Rogue. Upon reaching level three, he will default to the Arcane Trickster subclass.\n\nSpecial Features[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion will receive the Happy (Condition) after using the Vampire Bite ability on a humanoid.\n\nAstarion is immune to conditions and effects that do not affect undead, such as Mummy Rot (Condition).\n\nCompanion Quest[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: The Pale Elf\n\nAstarion's companion quest is called The Pale Elf. His story unravels as he explores his newfound freedom and how he can keep it, as well as coming to terms with the abuse inflicted on him, and the harm he has inflicted on others.\n\nRecruitment[edit | edit source]\n\nRecruitable in Act One.\n\nAstarion can be found standing on a road west of the crashed Nautiloid in the Wilderness. When found, a scene will play where he asks for help defeating an Intellect Devourer. Afterwards, he can be asked to join the party.\n\nApproval[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: Astarion/approval\n\nAstarion approves of displays of power and cruelty, and appreciates snarkiness and mocking. He is inspired when the player gains access to areas or information by deceiving others. The player does not have to be \"evil\" to gain his approval, however — he approves when the player makes choices that support independence and autonomy, are understanding toward his past, and when the player helps certain characters in need.\n\nAstarion disapproves of displays of weakness and does not like acts of kindness or charity that offer no reward. He also disapproves when the player tries to restrict him or deny him his autonomy.\n\nRomance[edit | edit source]\n\nSee main article: Astarion/Romance\n\nAstarion can be romanced by characters of any gender. His romance deals heavily with his personal character growth, his relationship with intimacy, his discovery of what he wants in life, and the reclaiming of his autonomy. Astarion's romance also has different outcomes depending on the choices made at the end of his companion quest.\n\nDescription[edit | edit source]\n\nAppearance[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion is a high elf vampire spawn that appears to be in his late 30s despite being multiple centuries old. He is approximately 5'11\" tall and has a medium build and sharp facial features. He has pallid skin with dark circles and bags under his crimson eyes, as well as smile lines around his mouth and a faint beauty mark on his right cheek. He also has jaw-length, curly silver hair styled with pomade and curls around his long pointed ears. He has a bite-mark scar on the right side of his neck from when his old master Cazador Szarr turned him into a vampire, and a myriad of scars carved by Cazador covering most of his back. When it comes to clothes, Astarion's choice in attire is usually on the fancier side, wearing an elaborate doublet, leather chaps and embroidered leather shoes when you recruit him. He takes meticulous care to embroider and repair the clothing that he owns, keeping it in good condition as best he can. Astarion is also very mindful of his hygiene and physical appearance overall, especially regarding his hair, nails, skin, and clothing.\n\nPersonality[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion's personality at the start is very much influenced by his background as a high elf magistrate and his time spent as a vampire spawn slave. Astarion is charming, eloquent, cunning, witty, sarcastic, and practical. But, having felt abandoned by the world and its heroes, Astarion is also very bitter, cynical, self-centered, manipulative, distrustful, prejudiced, and vengeful. His top priorities are his own autonomy, his own safety, and his revenge on Cazador, though he also prioritizes the party’s safety as a whole. He is largely apathetic toward the feelings of others and has little interest in helping them for no reward, as he feels that if he didn't get help, nobody else should. He also holds prejudices against the Gur people and small races such as gnomes.\n\nAstarion at the beginning of the game is very fear-motivated and has a low self-worth, despite his confident and arrogant persona. He will attempt to manipulate others with sex to get them on his side so that he has protection from Cazador, as he believes sex is all he is good for and it is one of few ways he knows how to form relationships with other people. He is also willing to do almost anything to gain power or advantage so that he can secure his own safety and avoid being under Cazador's control again, even if it means harming others or doing something he finds personally distasteful. Although, he has reservations about sacrificing his bodily autonomy even if it means he can gain an advantageous power.\n\nHowever, as the story progresses, Astarion can develop and change his personality depending on how he is guided during his questline. If Astarion's fears, beliefs, and unhealthy behaviors are contested, he will begin to deconstruct his cynical worldview, learning to stand up for himself, show empathy toward others, reconcile with those he has hurt in the past, form genuine bonds with people he trusts, and start to heal from his trauma. But, if Astarion is led down a path where his behaviors, fears, and beliefs are validated and encouraged, he will instead become a fearful, power-hungry, and abusive man who continues to repress his trauma.\n\nGameplay[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion's default class is rogue. His default high elf cantrip is Fire Bolt, but if selected as an origin, the player can choose any high elf cantrip they wish. As a vampire spawn he has access to a unique Vampire Bite, however this action does not appear as a companion until after the party finds out about his vampirism. If played as an origin, the ability becomes available after waking up from the Nautiloid crash.\n\nProficiencies[edit | edit source]\n\nUnlockable bonuses[edit | edit source]\n\nThe following bonuses and actions are unlockable through certain decisions in Astarion's companion quest:\n\nVampire Ascendant\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n\nPre-Vampirism[edit | edit source]\n\nAstarion was a young magistrate in Baldur's Gate, until one day he was assaulted and almost killed by a gang of Gur because of a ruling he had handed down. The vampire lord, Cazador Szarr, who had taken interest in him, approached Astarion while he was dying and turned him into one of his slaves – a vampire spawn.\n\nLife as Cazador's Spawn[edit | edit source]\n\nAfter being turned, Astarion and his vampire spawn \"siblings\" lived at the Szarr Palace in the Upper City. And being vampire spawn, Astarion and his \"siblings\" were completely subservient to Cazador, bound to him through the bond of creator and creation. Cazador could use this power to completely control Astarion and the others, and he imposed three main commands onto his spawn. 1. \"Thou must not drink from thinking creatures, 2. \"Thou must never leave my side, unless commanded,\" and 3. \"Thou must obey me in all things.\" Astarion and the other spawn could not physically refuse these commands. Cazador would then use this power and these \"rules\" to physically and emotionally abuse and torture Astarion for centuries, and any form of attempted resistance or escape was met with harsh punishment. For example, Astarion was once sealed away in a coffin, starving, for over a year because he had tried to disobey one of Cazador's commands. Also, the abuse inflicted onto Astarion and the other spawn was brutal and frequent. They were physically tortured and had \"poetry\" carved into their backs by Cazador, they were frequently emotionally abused as Cazador would play mind games on them, they would be fed dead rats and bugs, they would be commanded to physically torture themselves and the other spawn, they would be starved for long periods of time, and also be forced to venture out into the Lower City to seduce people and engage in sexual activity with them so that they could lure them back to Szarr Palace to later be fed on by Cazador.\n\nHowever, while out in a city tavern seducing a young noble to bring back to Cazador, Astarion was abducted by the rogue Nautiloid and was tadpoled alongside other victims.\n\nStory Involvement[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Pale Elf[edit | edit source]\n\nSee main article: The Pale Elf\n\nThe Pale Elf is Astarion's personal quest. It is added to the journal upon recruiting him, and it spans all three acts of the game.\n\nAct One[edit | edit source]\n\nAct Two[edit | edit source]\n\nAct Three[edit | edit source]\n\nEndings[edit | edit source]\n\nZombie Astarion\n\nIf the party fails to free him in time and/or Cazador successfully ascends instead, Astarion will be transformed into a zombie with red skin, exposed bones, and all of his defining physical traits gone. Carrying Zombie Astarion back to camp and casting Revivify on him turns him into a camp follower with the same tent and idle animations as his living self; however, he cannot be talked to or re-recruited, and he will not appear at the Reunion Party.\n\nLife as a spawn vigilante\n\nIf the party stopped the ritual peacefully by persuading him to be better than Cazador or euthanizing a different spawn during the battle, Astarion's sunlight vulnerability spontaneously returns to him a few minutes after defeating the Netherbrain, ending the hope that his immunity from the tadpole might be permanent. After quickly saying goodbye he is forced to run away and find shade, but the narrator or another companion reassures the player character that he will be safe. Back to a normal vampire spawn, Astarion continues adventuring on his own as a nighttime assassin, but a heroic one who only kills \"the right people\" that deserve it. Instead of grieving over his inability to be in the sun, he develops a renewed sense of self, accepting the dark as a part of him and being driven by his newfound inspiration of hope rather than fear. If he is romanced, the player character can join him in these adventures.\n\nIf an origin Karlach romanced Astarion, he instead offers to join her in Avernus. If a spawn origin Astarion romanced Karlach, however, he cannot convince her to go to Avernus because he's forced to run away from the sunlight before her ending cutscene, and she dies while Astarion adventures alone.\n\nLife as a vampire overlord\n\nIf the party failed to stop the ritual or allowed him to complete it, Astarion takes over the Szarr Palace as his own and becomes an ascended vampire lord, rising in status and power in Baldur's Gate. When spoken to at the Reunion Party, Astarion brags about his rising status as the city's \"puppet-master\" and generally looks down upon the player character. He can be challenged on his new behavior and compared to Cazador, but Astarion brushes off these callouts.\n\nIf romanced and turned into a vampire spawn, Astarion asks the player character to talk with the other companions at the Reunion Party, gather information, and share it with him later while he stays behind and drinks wine. He is surprised to hear that the others are somehow succeeding in life without his supervision, but he is uninterested to engage in conversation with them himself. If romanced as a mind flayer, the player character is simply an ally to Astarion, as they can't be turned into a spawn, but his Reunion Party dialogue remains the same as if they were one. If an origin Karlach romanced Astarion, she is unable to be turned into a vampire spawn because of her engine running hot, so he breaks up with her during their next Long Rest.\n\nHowever, there are a few ways for Astarion to end up as a vampire lord without being evil. Similar to other origin characters, an ascended origin Astarion has the option to go to Avernus with Karlach in any relationship status, abandoning the vampire lord's life completely to fight demons by her side instead. Additionally, if an origin Karlach romancing Astarion does not rest between fighting Cazador and the Netherbrain (thus skipping the breakup scene entirely), he instead demands to bring her to Avernus himself.\n\nQuest Rewards[edit | edit source]\n\nIf Cazador is defeated:\n\nHigh Security Vault n°3 Key\n\nRhapsody as loot from Cazador\n\nSzarr Family Ring\n\nWoe as loot from Cazador\n\nIf Cazador is defeated and Astarion does not complete the Rite of Profane Ascension:\n\nAid of Ulma and the Gur for Gather Your Allies\n\nIf Cazador is defeated and Astarion completes the Rite of Profane Ascension:\n\nAid of Astarion's servants of the night for Gather Your Allies\n\nAstarion gains the passive feature Vampire Ascendant which grants the actions Ascendant Bite and Misty Escape (Vampire Ascendant) and an additional 1d10Necrotic damage to weapon and unarmed attacks.\n\nInteractions & Scenes[edit | edit source]\n\nIn-Party Interactions & Scenes[edit | edit source]\n\nAs a companion while out traveling, Astarion has unique dialogue interactions available during and after certain events.
