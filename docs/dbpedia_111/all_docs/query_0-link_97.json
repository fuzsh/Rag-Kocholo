        "text": "System for identifying vehicles\n\n\"VIN\" redirects here. For other uses, see Vin.\n\nA vehicle identification number (VIN; also called a chassis number or frame number) is a unique code, including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).[1]\n\nThere are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVINs were first used in 1954 in the United States.[2] From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers and even divisions within a manufacturer used different formats. By 1966, GM had settled on a 13-digit VIN, and standardized its VIN format across its divisions in 1972.\n\nIn 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format.[2] It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters O (o), I (i), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 0, 1, and 9).\n\nAfter the introduction of the ISO norm, the manufacturers which produced vehicles for the American market very quickly adjusted to this standard. The ISO introduced recommendations for applying the VIN standard and its structure, and the VIN was also used in Europe. However, the sets of information contained in it were introduced gradually. For example, Volkswagen started to encode bigger chunks of information during 1995–1997, and the control digit during 2009–2015 for selected models from the group. The VIN control digit is also used, although not in all brand-models. In the European vehicles, it can be found e.g. in Audi A1.[3]\n\nClassification\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.\n\nFMVSS 115, Part 565: Used in United States and Canada[4]\n\nISO 3779: Used in Europe and many other parts of the world\n\nSAE J853: Very similar to the ISO standard\n\nADR 61/2 used in Australia, referring to ISO 3779 and 3780[5]\n\nComponents\n\n[edit]\n\nModern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779[6] and ISO 3780,[7] respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States.[8]\n\nThe VIN comprises the following sections:\n\nStandard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ISO 3779 World manufacturer identifier Vehicle descriptor section Vehicle identifier section European Union[9]\n\nmore than 500 vehicles/year\n\nWorld manufacturer identifier Indication of \"the general characteristics of the vehicle\" Indication that provides \"clear identification of a particular vehicle\" European Union[9]\n\n500 or fewer vehicles/year\n\nWorld manufacturer identifier 9 Indication of \"the general characteristics of the vehicle\" Indication that provides \"clear identification of a particular vehicle\" North America\n\nmore than 2,000 vehicles/year\n\nWorld manufacturer identifier Vehicle attributes Check digit Model year Plant code Sequential number North America\n\n2,000 or fewer vehicles/year\n\nWorld manufacturer identifier 9 Vehicle attributes Check digit Model year Plant code Manufacturer identifier Sequential number\n\nWorld manufacturer identifier\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1,000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to General Motors in the United States), 1G1 represents Chevrolet passenger cars; 1G2, Pontiac passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet trucks.\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.[10]\n\nThe first character of the WMI is typically the region in which the manufacturer is located although there are exceptions e.g. the WMI 7SA was assigned to Tesla Inc. in the United States in 2021.[11] In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of W0L because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.[10]\n\nCountry or region codes\n\n[edit]\n\nVehicle descriptor section\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette, U is for a 6.0-liter V8 engine, and E is for a 7.0-liter V8.\n\nNorth American check digits\n\n[edit]\n\nOne element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a check digit, compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.\n\nVehicle identifier section\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the vehicle identifier section or VIS. This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number.\n\nModel year encoding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe North American implementation of the VIS uses the 10th digit to encode the model year of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the model year code. Outside North America the 10th digit is usually 0.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially General Motors and Chrysler, as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\nCode Year Code Year Code Year Code Year Code Year Code Year A 1980 L 1990 Y 2000 A 2010 L 2020 Y 2030 B 1981 M 1991 1 2001 B 2011 M 2021 1 2031 C 1982 N 1992 2 2002 C 2012 N 2022 2 2032 D 1983 P 1993 3 2003 D 2013 P 2023 3 2033 E 1984 R 1994 4 2004 E 2014 R 2024 4 2034 F 1985 S 1995 5 2005 F 2015 S 2025 5 2035 G 1986 T 1996 6 2006 G 2016 T 2026 6 2036 H 1987 V 1997 7 2007 H 2017 V 2027 7 2037 J 1988 W 1998 8 2008 J 2018 W 2028 8 2038 K 1989 X 1999 9 2009 K 2019 X 2029 9 2039\n\nOn April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, \"so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years\", in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There were three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n\nThe make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n\nIn order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.[12][citation needed] If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.\n\nThe model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than 10,000 lb (4,500 kg), as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980 to 2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\nPlant code\n\n[edit]\n\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\nProduction number\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\nCheck-digit calculation\n\n[edit]\n\nA check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a check digit, first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see below) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs 5GZCZ43D13S812715 (correct with leading five) and SGZCZ43D13S812715 (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124, and the GM-T body image, KLATF08Y1VB363636, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\nTransliterating the numbers\n\n[edit]\n\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's EBCDIC) are in the following chart. I, O, and Q are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with N/A (not applicable). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\nTransliteration key: values for VIN decoding A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4 E: 5 F: 6 G: 7 H: 8 — J: 1 K: 2 L: 3 M: 4 N: 5 — P: 7 — R: 9 — S: 2 T: 3 U: 4 V: 5 W: 6 X: 7 Y: 8 Z: 9\n\nS is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\nWeights used in calculation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.\n\nWeight factor table Position 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Weight 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2\n\nWorked example\n\n[edit]\n\nConsider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.\n\nVIN 1 M 8 G D M 9 A K P 0 4 2 7 8 8 Value 1 4 8 7 4 4 9 1 0 2 7 0 4 2 7 8 8 Weight 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Products 8 28 48 35 16 12 18 10 0 18 56 0 24 10 28 24 16\n\nThe VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.\n\nCopy the weights from the weight factor row above.\n\nThe products row is the result of the multiplication of the columns in the Value and Weight rows.\n\nThe products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, 351.\n\nFind the remainder after dividing by 11\n\n351 MOD 11 = 10\n\n351 ÷ 11 = 3110⁄11\n\nThe remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as X.\n\nWith a check digit of X, the VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788 is written 1M8GDM9AXKP042788.\n\nA VIN with straight-ones (seventeen consecutive 1s) has the nice feature that its check digit 1 matches the calculated value 1. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder 1⁄11; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\nVIN scanning\n\n[edit]\n\nThe VIN is marked in multiple locations; normally in the lower corner of the windshield on the driver's side, under the bonnet next to latch, at the front end of the vehicle frame, and inside the door pillar on the driver's side.[13] On newer vehicles VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via OBD-II.[14] There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.[15]\n\nList of common WMI\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) assigns the WMI[16] (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers. The following list shows a selection of world manufacturer codes.\n\nWMI Country Manufacturer\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nAAA South Africa Audi South Africa made by Volkswagen of South Africa AAK FAW Vehicle Manufacturers SA (PTY) Ltd.
