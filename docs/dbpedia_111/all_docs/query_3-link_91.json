        "text": "From crafting blogs to social media posts, marketers often find themselves puzzled over what the right character count is. It's not always about the limits set by different platforms but rather the optimal number of characters for user engagement.\n\nFor example, you probably know the character limit for a post on X is 280, but did you know using less is actually more effective? (Hold tight — you’ll soon know why.)\n\nWe've previously discussed how to optimize your content for various platforms. Now, it's time to understand the specifics of character limits, both mandatory and ideal, for different online channels, all in one place.\n\nBelow is a more detailed breakdown of character limits and ideal character counts for posts on your blog, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube.\n\nWhat is character count?\n\nWhy Character Counts Matter\n\nThe Length & Character Count for Everything on the Internet\n\nShow Your Character\n\nWhy Character Counts Matter\n\nEvery social media platform has its own character limit for posts. But as we mentioned earlier, it isn't just about the character limits set by these platforms; knowing the ideal character count to use in your posts is key.\n\nLet us delve into the top 5 reasons that highlight the importance of character count in your content strategy:\n\n1. Optimizes for platform algorithms\n\nDifferent social media platforms have different algorithms, most of which consider post length to boost content visibility. By keeping within an ‘ideal’ character count, you can ensure your post performs well in the algorithm‘s ranking system.\n\nThis makes your content more likely to appear in your audience’s feeds.\n\n2. Enhances readability\n\nEver been confronted by a lengthy block of text? It‘s overwhelming, right? Shorter, concise posts with an optimal character count are easier to read and digest.\n\nThey look less intimidating and are more likely to be read fully, enhancing your message’s impact.\n\n3. Improves message clarity\n\nAbiding by a character count forces you to be concise and clear in your messaging. This eliminates unnecessary fluff and helps ensure your core message shines through clearly, improving its overall effectiveness.\n\n4. Encourages sharing\n\nPosts that are short and to the point are more shareable. They‘re easier for users to quote or repost, especially on platforms like X and Threads, where character limits are stricter, thus potentially increasing your content’s reach.\n\n5. Enhances mobile user experience\n\nWith more people accessing social media platforms via mobile devices, character counts are becoming increasingly important.\n\nPosts with ideal character counts are more likely to be mobile-friendly, offering a better reading experience for your mobile audience.\n\nThe Length & Character Count for Everything on the Internet\n\n1. Blog Posts\n\nQuick reference:\n\nPost length: 1,400 - 2,100 words\n\nTitle: Under 60 characters\n\nMeta Description: Under 155 characters\n\nFeatured Resource: 6 Free Blog Post Templates\n\nPost Body:\n\nWhen it comes to the length of blog posts, there are a few different items to consider. For example:\n\nThe average reading speed of native English-speaking adults remains commonly cited as 200-300 words per minute, based on the results of several studies.\n\nAt that reading rate, the ideal post length is 1,400 to 2,100 words.\n\nThat aligns with research previously conducted by Capsicum Mediaworks, which indicated that, on average, the top 10 results for most Google searches are between 2,000 and 2,500 words.\n\nImage Source\n\nBut that‘s just the post body — let’s have a look at the other areas of text that comprise a full blog post.\n\nTitle\n\nThe length of your title depends on your goals and where it will appear.\n\nLet's start with SEO. Do you want this post to rank really well in search? It turns out that it often has to do with the dimensions of each entry on a search engine results page (SERP).\n\nFor Google, titles of search results are usually contained at a length of 600 pixels — which Moz measures as being able to display the first 50-60 characters of a title tag.\n\nSo, if you don't want your title to get cut off in the search results, it might be best to keep it under 60 characters.\n\nBut when in doubt, you can double-check the length of your meta description and title tags with this handy tool from HigherVisibility, or you can use Moz's title tag preview tool.\n\nFor Moz's title tag tool, type in your headline, and the tool will show you how it would appear in Google results.\n\nImage Source\n\nThen, you can optimize your title for social sharing. On X, for example, consider that each post has a limit of 280 characters; however, if you include an image, that doesn't count toward the limit.\n\nBut consider that even the average shortened URL takes up about 23 characters. That leaves you with about 257 characters left for the title and any accompanying text.\n\nIn our own analysis at HubSpot, we found that headlines between 8 –12 words in length got the most X shares on average, while headlines with either 12 or 14 words got the most Facebook Likes.\n\nMeta Description\n\nA meta description refers to the HTML attribute that explains the contents of a given webpage. It's the short description you see on a SERP to “preview” what the page is about.\n\nMoz notes that Google seems to cut off most meta descriptions — sometimes called snippets — after roughly two lines of text. However, there‘s some conjecture that, like title tags, it’s actually based on pixel count.\n\nIn any case, it amounts to about 160 characters, though this particular outlet recommends keeping it at 155.\n\nAgain, you can double-check the length of your meta description and title tags with this handy tool from HigherVisibility.\n\nImage Source\n\n2. Facebook\n\nQuick reference:\n\nStatus updates: 63,206-character maximum | Ideal length is 40 characters\n\nVideo: 120-minute maximum | Ideal length is two minutes\n\nFacebook's character limit on status updates is 63,206. However, that's far from ideal, says former HubSpot Social Media Marketing Manager Chelsea Hunersen.\n\n“The social gurus will throw around the number 40 characters,” she says. \"That data seems to be backed up by BuzzSumo's ranking of HubSpot's own Facebook Page.\"\n\nBut why 40, specifically?\n\n“Ideally,” Hunersen says, “you'll want to use the copy in a status update to provide context for whatever you're linking to.”\n\nThat said, she notes, the copy of the status update itself isn‘t as important as the copy in the meta title or meta description that gets pulled in when you insert a link into your post. That’s right — social media posts have their own metadata too.\n\n“Often, people look at the image of the article and then directly down at the meta title and meta description for context clues,” she explains. “A lot of people don't realize you can change those.”\n\nEven on Facebook, it's still best to keep your meta title to fewer than 60 characters, and to 155 for meta descriptions.\n\nThere are some resources available to those familiar with coding that let you play around with social media metadata character counts, like these templates. But unless you're a developer, we recommend keeping it short and sweet.\n\nVideo\n\nWhile Facebook allows a maximum of 240 minutes for most videos (excluding Stories and Reels), we wouldn‘t advise posting anything that long unless you’re doing a special, social-media-only screening of a full-length film.\n\nImage Source\n\nFacebook recommends keeping videos short to about 15 seconds so viewers are more likely to watch to the end.\n\n3. X (Formerly Twitter)\n\nQuick reference:\n\nPosts: 280-character maximum\n\nDoes not include images, videos, or polls\n\nIdeal length is 240-259 characters\n\nHashtags: No more than two\n\nVideos: Maximum length is two minutes and 20 seconds\n\nFeatured Resource: How to Use Twitter for Business\n\nMarketers everywhere rejoiced when X finally eased up on its character count parameters, and such media as images, videos, and polls, as well as quoted posts, ceased counting toward its 140-character limit.\n\nStill, the “Quote” feature remains available, providing even greater character-saving measures. That happens when you press the rotating arrow icon to post and then add a comment in the provided text box.\n\nYou've still got 280 characters all to yourself to comment.\n\nIdeal Length Overall\n\nX differs from other platforms in the sense that longer posts tend to perform better and get the most engagement.\n\nAccording to SEO expert Kurt Gessler, posts with 240-259 characters tend to get the most likes.\n\nImage Source\n\nThe same goes for hashtags. X recommends keeping your hashtags short, easy to remember, and easy to spell. The platform also suggests sticking to only one or two hashtags at the most.\n\nVideos\n\nYou can post a video on X by importing a video or recording it using the X app. In any case, the maximum video length is two minutes and 20 seconds if you're not subscribed to X Blue.\n\nX Blue subscribers can upload videos of up to 60 minutes when posting from the website, and subscribers on the app can post videos of up to 10 minutes.\n\n4. LinkedIn\n\nProfiles\n\nHere‘s a handy list of some of LinkedIn’s most important profile character maximums:\n\nProfessional headline: 120\n\nSummary: 2,000\n\nPosition title: 100\n\nPosition description: 2,000 (200 character minimum)\n\nFoote also notes that \"if you select to also post on Twitter from LinkedIn, only the first 140 characters will show on your Twitter post.\"\n\nFeatured Resource: How to Use LinkedIn for Business & Marketing\n\nOriginal Content\n\nWith LinkedIn's publishing platform, users can now compose and share original written content with their networks, or publicly. Of course, that comes with its own character counts, according to Foote:\n\nPost headline: 100\n\nPost body: 40,000\n\n5. Instagram\n\nQuick reference:\n\nBio: 150\n\nHashtags: Up to 30\n\nCaptions: Ideal length is under 125 characters\n\nSince Instagram is, first and foremost, a platform for sharing photos and videos, the primary focus is typically your visual content. However, it‘s always helpful to provide some context and let users know what they’re looking at.\n\nGiven that, here are some helpful character counts for the text you include with your visual content.\n\nWhile Instagram doesn‘t seem to specify a maximum total number of caption characters, it does note that, within users’ feeds, the caption is cut off after the first three lines. For that reason, it's advised to limit captions to 125 characters.\n\nHowever, don't leave out important information just for the sake of keeping your entire caption visible. Instead, front load it with crucial details and calls-to-action, leaving any hashtags, @mentions, or extraneous information for the end.\n\nAs for Instagram Stories, there doesn‘t seem to be a ton of detail on character limits there, either. However, because the text overlays the visual content — which is the focus — don’t obscure too much of the photo or video with a caption.\n\nHere's a quick example of a short Instagram bio from my colleague.\n\n6. Snapchat\n\nQuick reference:\n\nCharacter limit: 80 per post\n\nSpeaking of not obscuring visual content — that brings us to Snapchat.\n\nInstagram Stories was, many believe, an effort to emulate the features of Snapchat, to create an opportunity for users to share quickly-disappearing photos and videos.\n\nAnd again, because the focus here is on the visual, you'll want to prevent distracting viewers from it with too much text.\n\nAnd, if you‘re looking for more guidance, just look at this particular app’s name, remember the “snap” element of it — a word that implies brevity — and try not to ramble. Here's a great example of how SXSW uses its captions efficiently:\n\n7. YouTube\n\nFeatured Resource: YouTube for Business – A 30-Day Roadmap\n\nHere we have yet another network that‘s focused on visual content, leading some to incorrectly assume that accompanying text, like titles and descriptions, doesn’t matter as much.\n\nThat's not entirely false. As a video-hosting platform, YouTube should primarily be used to showcase a brand‘s quality videos. However, like any other visual content, it needs context.\n\nPeople need to know what they’re watching, who it's from, and why it matters.\n\nUnfortunately, YouTube doesn't appear to provide any specific parameters over its character counts — except for your channel description, which, according to the official help site, is limited to 1,000 characters.\n\nBut other than that, it seems that the only guideline available is the alert display that lets you know, “Your [title or description] is too long,” if you've entered too much text in either of those fields.\n\nIn this case, we would advise taking the same approach as adding text to support your visuals on Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nLike the former, a video's description is cut off after the first line or two, so frontload the most important descriptors and CTAs, leaving extra details for the end.\n\nShow Your Character\n\nAs you set out to determine the length of your text, regardless of the platform, remember to do so with the user in mind.\n\nMany of these channel-mandated character limits are established for that reason — to keep audiences from getting bored or overwhelmed.\n\nLike anything else in marketing, it's never an exact science despite the best data. We encourage you to follow these guidelines but don‘t be afraid to experiment if they don’t always work.\n\nTest different amounts of text within your various channels, and keep track of how each post performs.\n\nFrom there, you can make decisions about which types of content, as well as its accompanying titles and descriptions, are the most well-received by your audience.\n\nEditor's Note: This post was originally published in January 2016 and was updated in December 2019 for accuracy and comprehensiveness."
