        "text": "Summary:An intriguing graffito on wall plaster has been recently discovered during an excavation in Nyon (VD, Switzerland). During the Roman Period, Nyon named Colonia Iulia Equestris was a Roman colony of legionary's veterans on the strategic road of Lake Geneva. The inscription does not seem to be a Latin or Greek inscription. It may be Aramaic cursive letters. The close comparison with other Hebrew and Aramaic inscriptions may give a palaeographical date around the first-second century CE. But several hypotheses of decipherment are available. If this identification is right, it would be the oldest inscription in Aramaic script discovered in modern Switzerland."
