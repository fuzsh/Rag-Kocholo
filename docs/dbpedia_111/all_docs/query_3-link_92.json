        "text": "Welcome to our Instagram Character Counter Tool!\n\nTo get started, simply paste or type your text into the text-box above and watch as the character counts update in real-time!\n\nFor your convenience, you can click the green \"copy text\" button to copy the text over to Instagram when you're done.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our Instagram caption limit checker.\n\nDifferent metrics explained\n\nIn the top left it will show the total characters typed out of the total Instagram caption character limit of 2200 characters. To the right of that it will countdown the total characters remaining. These metrics are on the top and in a bigger font because they are the most commonly used metrics.\n\nCaption truncation: In an Instagram post, if the caption is longer than 125 characters, everything after 125 characters will be hidden and you will need to click \"more\" in order to read the rest of the caption. It's a good idea to get your most important point across and hook the reader in those first 125 characters.\n\nHashtag limit: Instagram has a hashtag limit of 30 hashtags per caption. Anything more than this will not be allowed. We hope you enjoy this Instagram hashtag counter feature!\n\nDM limit: The Instagram DM character limit is 1000 characters. To access your DMs in Instagram click the paper plane icon in the top right corner. An Instagram DM character limit checker will help you keep your DMs under the limit.\n\nInstagram bio character limit: The Instagram bio character count is 150 characters. Our Instagram bio counter will give help you correct IG bio character count you are looking for.\n\nInstagram username character limit: The Instagram max username length is 30 characters.\n\nInstagram profile name character limit: The Instagram name character limit is also 30 characters.\n\nInstagram comment character limit: The Instagram comment character limit is also 2200 characters, just like the caption. Instagram comments can only contain up to 30 hashtags. The amount of comments you can publish in one day is between 180-200 due to Instagram's spam filter.\n\nMaking the most of Instagram captions\n\nIn a pool full of little squares of people's lives, flooded with hashtags and scrambled words - how do you know how to get the best out of Instagrams limit to captions and biographies?\n\nCaption - it's exactly what it says on the tin. It is supposed to capture the viewer to either describe what they are seeing, an explanation of what they are doing, or a riddle to keep them on their toes.\n\nBut how do you know when to use onomatopoeia and when to write a mini story?\n\nHere is your little pocket guide to standing out of the crowdâ¦\n\nTips to make your caption stand out\n\nSo assume you have posted a selfie, a photo with your friends, partner or family - this caption should be short and sweet. The caption here shouldn't take away from the value of the photo. A few simple words, a funny quote, a little riddle - something cheeky maybe!\n\nOn the other hand, you may want to show off your business idea, explain a project, give a How To, or maybe give advice. In this circumstance, your photo is the guide to the caption - in other words the caption is the star of the show.\n\nTry splitting this one into short 2-3 line paragraphs. If all the information is bundled together like a herd of sheep, the viewer will scroll past or lose interest. Snappy happy mini paragraphs draw the reader down the caption rather than across.\n\nSimilarly like other platforms, Instagram has a âcharacter limitâ of 2,200 characters for a caption. The question of why may cross your mind. From the outside, a limit may be make it difficult to businesses who are trying to sell their product, however the limit may also entice customers and viewers alike. A strict limit means the individual has to focus their main posts into shorter sections therefore giving the post more meaning and structure.\n\nWhat is the perfect length of a caption?\n\nI guess you could say we have covered this dependant on the photo posted, however it will also vary from person to person.\n\nWhat is the niche of your page? Who is your target audience? Are you a blogger or do you use social media for personal use only?\n\nThese factors may be taken into account and the use of âhashtagsâ are usually solely based on your target audience.\n\nInstagram captions depend on the person\n\nFor example, a personal trainer is likely to post informational posts, client transformations and How-To posts. Their captions are therefore going to be lengthy and in listicle style.\n\nA blogger who perhaps shares their travels or their wardrobe hauls is likely to post short and sweet captions in order to ensure the focus is on the picture rather than the caption.\n\nBoth of their examples are also likely to rinse the hashtags within their captions as this will draw more engagement to their page.\n\nOn the flip side, someone who uses Instagram for personal use is less likely to make use of hashtags as their posts may be more personal such as family photos, days with their partner and similiar. The captions on a personal page tend to sway towards the funnier side and have a more âpersonal feelâ as such rather than more generalized third person captions bloggers and businesses may use.\n\nWhen to use emojis\n\nNow let's talk about emojis. We use them everyday to emphasize the feelings we show, the reactions we have and the things we are doing - there is something for every occasion.\n\nThey play a key role in your caption to draw the eye to certain key words or places within your text. A simple color within a black and white wave is going to emphasize that section to the reader.\n\nUsing niche related emojis will attract your specific target audience. Similarly however, including generic emojis such as botanics, weather, hearts and similar will attract a variation of people to your post.\n\nIt's important however not to overpower your caption with unrelated emojis if you are from the creator or business side of Instagram as it may portray a childlike, silly post. Using numerous emojis within a personal page is less likely to put off your target audience as they are not looking for informative, engaging posts - they are looking for personal, fun and lifestyle posts.\n\nFinal thoughts regarding Instagram captions\n\nFinding your niche, your target audience and what you want to get out of your Instagram account will lead you into the best ways to keep your audiences attention whether drawing to the caption or using the caption to draw them to the photo.\n\nThe only limit should be your imagination.\n\nInstagram post formating FAQ\n\nWhat does caption truncation mean?\n\nInstagram won't display an entire 2200 character post, just the first 125 characters to save space. This is called caption truncation. After the truncation, you have to click \"more\" in order to read the rest of the post.\n\nDoes the Instagram post character limit include spaces?\n\nYes, it includes spaces and enter keys (also known as carriage return).\n\nWhat is the Instagram caption word limit?\n\nIf you are looking for an Instagram caption word limit checker please be aware that the Instagram caption limit is based on characters and not words.
