I think that pig was actually a man of the Night Watch (who Coldhands previusly killed).\n\nI have somekind of evidence:\n\n*Just before Bran talks about the pig he was warging on Summer and he taste human flesh\n\n*In prologue of ADWD Haggon told Varamyr that eat another human was an abomination, and Bran did everything that Haggon named as an abomination (except be in Summer when his giving a shewolf love)\n\n*In Sam II of ASOS he thinks that a man being on fire smell like a pig, so it's probable that Bran mistook the smell\n\n*And OFC JojenPaste\n\nIf this was posted over and over before sorry :c thx for reading"
