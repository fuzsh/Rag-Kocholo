        "text": "This article has been verified for the current version (1.7) of the game.\n\nCharacters are prominent individuals within countries. Depending on their role, they affect countries in various ways. Each character has an interest group affiliation, a personal ideology, a popularity value, a culture (determining their name and appearance), and a number of character traits. Throughout the game, characters age and die, and are replaced by new characters.\n\nCharacter roles[edit | edit source]\n\nThere are four roles characters serve in a country: rulers, interest group leaders, commanders (generals and admirals), and agitators. Rulers, heirs, and interest group leaders are also collectively referred to as politicians.\n\nRuler[edit | edit source]\n\nA ruler is a country's head of state. Whether a hereditary monarch, an elected president, or a dictator, a ruler's traits affect the country as a whole. The governance principles and distribution of power laws affect the amount of government legitimacy gained from including the ruler's interest group in the government. The ruler's popularity also translates to a boost or penalty of authority. In monarchies, the country also has an heir – a character that becomes the new ruler once the current one dies. If there is no heir yet, there is a daily chance to generate one if the ruler is at least 20 years old (with an increasing chance after they turn 30). A male ruler of a monarchy or dictatorship can also serve as a general.\n\nInterest group leaders[edit | edit source]\n\nEvery interest group has a leader, who greatly affects how the interest group functions. The leader's traits and popularity affect the interest group's pop attraction and political power, and even its approval. Furthermore, the leader's personal ideology becomes part of the interest group's ideologies for as long as they remain the leader. Many causes, such as communism or feminism, can only achieve support this way. Once a leader dies, if at least one existing character (such as a General or Admiral) supports the same interest group and has at least 0 popularity, then the character with the highest popularity among the interest group's supporters becomes its next leader. If no existing character meets both of these criteria, then a new character is generated and becomes leader.\n\nCommanders[edit | edit source]\n\nGenerals and admirals command the country's armies and fleets, respectively. Their traits can give various bonuses and penalties to the units under their command. The interest group that a commander supports receives extra political power, which increases with the commander's rank (which also raises their command limit and bureaucracy cost). If their interest group is part of a revolution, the commander supports the revolution instead of the government – with all the troops they command. If a commander dies, a new one has to be manually recruited. They can also be retired early, at the cost of their interest group's approval.\n\nAgitators[edit | edit source]\n\nMain article: Agitator\n\nAgitators lead political movements to support their ideological goals in a country. An agitator might be the only avenue towards moving a country in a direction opposed by its political elite, by providing support to enact laws that would otherwise find no support. Alternatively, they might be dangerous dissidents who oppose the very foundations of the government, leading the people to revolt against the state.\n\nPopularity[edit | edit source]\n\nEach character has a popularity score between −100 and +100, reflecting how the general public views them. Popularity mostly comes from traits, though commanders can also gain or lose popularity temporarily by winning or losing battles. A character's popularity has different effects depending on their role:\n\nRuler: Popularity provides a direct authority bonus or penalty – e.g. +50 popularity gives +50 authority.\n\nInterest Group Leader: Popularity affects interest group pop attraction by 0.25% per point of popularity[1] – e.g. +100 popularity improves interest group pop attraction by +25%. It also affects their party's momentum during elections by 0.05% per point of popularity.\n\nAgitator: Popularity affects movement support by 0.5% per point of popularity – e.g. +50 popularity gives a 25% boost to movement support.\n\nCommander: Popular commanders may become leaders for their interest group once the current one is removed. If they have at least 10 or 30 popularity, they can also gain the Popular or Celebrity Commander trait respectively.\n\nLifespan[edit | edit source]\n\nCharacters live until the age of 75 on average[2].\n\nCharacter health is a percentage between 0% and 200%, with a baseline of 100%. It increases or decreases from various traits and modifiers and is the primary determiner of life expectancy.\n\nCharacters are considered adults at age 16 and old at age 60.\n\nInterest group affiliation[edit | edit source]\n\nAside from interest group leaders, generated characters have a weighted chance of being affiliated with each interest group, modified by each interest group's clout. Namely, these are rulers and heirs in hereditary governments, agitators, and commanders. Historical characters are not affected by this weighting unless they have a variable interest group affiliation.\n\nInterest group affiliation Interest group Ruler/ Heir Agitator Commander Common modifiers\n\nInterest group is marginalized: ×0.1\n\nInterest group is powerful: ×2\n\nInterest group is marginalized: ×0\n\n— Armed Forces\n\nBase: 1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas any of: ×2\n\nAutocracy\n\nOligarchy\n\nSingle-Party State\n\nHas any of: ×0.5\n\nCensus Suffrage\n\nUniversal Suffrage\n\nHas none of: ×0.5\n\nProfessional Army\n\nMass Conscription\n\nBase: 0.5 Base: 5 Devout\n\nBase: 1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas State Religion: ×2\n\nDoes not have State Religion: ×0.25\n\nHas State Atheism: ×0\n\nState religion is any of: ×2\n\nSunni\n\nShiite\n\nTheravada\n\nBase: 0.5 Base: 1 Industrialists\n\nBase: 1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas any of: ×2\n\nOligarchy\n\nWealth Voting\n\nHas Laissez-Faire: ×1.25\n\nDoes not have Mutual Funds: ×0.5\n\nDoes not have Currency Standards: ×0\n\nBase: 0.25 Base: 0.5 Intelligentsia\n\nBase: 1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas Technocracy: ×3\n\nHas Appointed Bureaucrats: ×1.5\n\nDoes not have Empiricism: ×0\n\nBase: 0.75 Base: 1 Landowners\n\nBase: 1.5\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas any of: ×2\n\nSerfdom\n\nSlave Trade\n\nLegacy Slavery\n\nHas any of: ×2\n\nAutocracy\n\nOligarchy\n\nLanded Voting\n\nBase: 0.25 Base: 2 Petite Bourgeoisie\n\nBase: 1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas Elected Bureaucrats: ×1.5\n\nHas Ethnostate: ×2\n\nBase: 1 Base: 1 Rural Folk\n\nBase: 0.25\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas Homesteading: ×2\n\nHas Serfdom: ×0\n\nBase: 1 Base: 1 Trade Unions\n\nBase: 0.1\n\nModifiers:\n\nHas Workers' Protections: ×2\n\nHas No Workers' Rights: ×0\n\nBase: 1 Base: 0.5\n\nCharacter interactions[edit | edit source]\n\nCharacter interactions are various actions that change a character's role or otherwise affect a certain character.
