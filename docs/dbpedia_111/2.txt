You can format your text by using wiki markup. This consists of normal characters like asterisks, apostrophes, or equal signs which have a special function in the wiki, sometimes depending on their position. For example, to format a word in italic, you include it in two pairs of apostrophes like ''this''.

Section formatting – only at the beginning of the line Section Headings of different levels

== Level 2 == === Level 3 === ==== Level 4 ==== ===== Level 5 ===== ====== Level 6 ======

Skip Level 1, it is page name level.

Do not put any text on the same line after the ending equal signs.

An article with 4 or more headings automatically creates a table of contents (unless setting the magic word __NOTOC__).

At the end of the line, if the line begins with a semicolon (;), any inserted colon (:) will not be displayed. If you want for the colon to be displayed, escape it by writing &#58;.

Preformatted text

Start each line with a space. Text is '''preformatted''' and ''markups'' '''''can''''' be done.

This way of preformatting only applies to section formatting. Character formatting markups are still effective.

Preformatted text blocks

<nowiki>Start with a space in the first column, (before the <nowiki>). Then your block format will be maintained. This is good for copying in code blocks: def function(): """documentation string""" if True: print True else: print False</nowiki>

MediaWiki ignores single line breaks. To start a new paragraph, leave an empty line. You can force a line break within a paragraph with the HTML tag ‎<br />.

Some HTML tags are allowed in MediaWiki, for example ‎<code>, ‎<div>, and ‎<span>. These apply anywhere you insert them.

The q element must not be used in place of quotation marks that do not represent quotes; for example, it is inappropriate to use the q element for marking up sarcastic statements.[1]

Customized preformatted text

<pre style="color: red"> Text is '''preformatted''' with a style and ''markups'' '''''cannot''''' be done </pre>

A CSS style can be named within the style attribute.

Symbols and other special characters not available on your keyboard can be inserted in a multitude of ways. Many Operating Systems and browsers allow you to insert special characters through a menu option or Operating System panel. Additionally, you can use the WikiEditor or VisualEditor to insert them into the edit screen.

As a last resort, you can use a special sequence of characters. Those sequences are called HTML entities. For example, the following sequence (entity) &rarr; when inserted will be shown as right arrow HTML symbol → and &mdash; when inserted will be shown as an em dash HTML symbol —.

Hover over any symbol to reveal the entity that produces it. Some symbols not available in the current font will appear as empty squares.

See the list of all HTML entities on the Wikipedia article List of HTML entities. Additionally, MediaWiki supports two non-standard entity reference sequences: &רלמ; and &رلم; which are both considered equivalent to &rlm; which is a right-to-left mark. (Used when combining right to left languages with left to right languages in the same page.)

&lt;span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Typo to be corrected</span> → <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Typo to be corrected</span>

Nowiki for HTML

‎<nowiki /> can prohibit (HTML) tags:

<<nowiki/>pre> → <pre>

But not & symbol escapes:

&<nowiki/>amp; → &

To print & symbol escapes as text, use "&amp;" to replace the "&" character (eg. type "&amp;nbsp;", which results in "&nbsp;").
