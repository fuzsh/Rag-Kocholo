This looks like a bug with one-box for Wikipedia page:

This section doesn’t seem like it is supposed to be posted in the box:

(.mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}French pronunciation: [boz‿aʁ də pari])

At the source page it displays as: The Beaux-Arts de Paris (French pronunciation: [boz‿aʁ də pari])

Same thing with this other page, looks like system is confused by pronunciation link:

Is this something that may be further refined one day or any ideas why these one-boxes do this?

Can be avoided with Wikipedia page sub-category link that doesn’t have the pronunciation link at the beginning:

French version:

How can that be done? Don’t see a setting for that, would that need to be integrated into the source/core code for a revision to the app in next iteration?

Wikipedia is listed as a domain that could be not one boxed maybe for a reason:

onebox settings

Don’t understand what these other settings are.
