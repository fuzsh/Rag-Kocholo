        "text": "--Jill Lances\n\nThe Kinks’ Dave Davies is taking issue with Guitar World magazine after they posted an article claiming rock producer Eddie Kramer confirmed the long-held rumor that Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page played guitar on the band’s hit “You Really Got Me.”\n\n“I met Jimmy while he was working with the Kinks in the early ’60s when they were doing ‘You Really Got Me,'” he reportedly said. “I know the Davies brothers will say otherwise, but I recall seeing Jimmy coming in and doing an overdub on that song. There’s some contention about that, but that’s how I remember it.”\n\nDavies later took to social media to shoot down the suggestion, noting Kramer insists he never made those comments.\n\n“I demand an immediate retraction from @GuitarWorld and @guitar I spoke to @EdKramerTweets yesterday and he denies ever saying that @JimmyPage played on @theKinks YRGM,” he wrote. “I played all the guitar parts on YRGM Ed Kramer told me yesterday he was misquoted.”\n\nHe added, “I’m so tired of reporters getting it wrong.”\n\nRumors that Page appeared on the song have been circulating for years, but both Davies and Page himself have denied them.\n\n\"You Really Got Me,\" the third single The Kinks ever released, hit #1 in the U.K. It was the band’s breakthrough hit in the U.S., peaking at #7 on the chart. It was covered by Van Halen on their 1978 self-titled debut.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

It's hard to tell sometimes...especially with someone I am not familiar with, as KnightsofNi is fairly new here. The death of real music journalism and the rise of bullshit clickbait music sites means there are an awful lot of articles being written in the vein of \"X says this about Y\" and you find out the writer (a more accurate description would be 'cut + paster') has taken old quotes from ages ago out of context and passed them off as current news.\n\nJimmy Page and Led Zeppelin have enough baggage to deal with without adding made-up beefs into the mix.\n\nI am of the opinion that Page did, in fact, play on \"You Really Got Me\". The reason I think this is from an interview he did in Tokyo in 1990. The interviewer asked him point blank if he played on it, and he refused to say if he did or didn't. He kept repeating the same line: \"I have played on Kinks records.\" He also very briefly made a comment on Ray Davies' behavior around the subject, which implied that the guy (Ray) was not balanced mentally and a bit of a hothead. It seemed quite obvious he was answering the question without directly answering it, which of course the interviewers didn't get at all (it was a horrible interview - the interviewers were not particularly intelligent, insightful, good listeners or able to read the room).\n\nIn other words, Page didn't want to deal with the BS around the subject, be it litigious or otherwise. But his answers and the way in which he answered this line of questioning spoke volumes. He refused to say he DIDN'T play on the record which I'm assuming was a point of pride thing. He didn't want to deal with the drama but also refused to say he didn't play on the record."
