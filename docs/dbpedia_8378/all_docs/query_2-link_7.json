        "text": "What albums or songs did he [Dave Davies] play casino on?\n\nVery few, if any.\n\nThere's quite a lot out there on the subject of the Kinks' guitars. \"X-Ray\" by Ray Davies [1994] is (in my opinion) the best autobiography ever penned by a rock star. Literate and entertaining, it blends a pseudo-Orwellian literary device around Ray Davies' factual recollections of the early days of the Kinks. Dave Davies' \"Kink\" [1996] is your typical run-of-the-mill, ghost-written rock bio, (but is probably pretty accurate, despite suffering, in the later chapters at least, from its author's desire to snipe at the more creative brother, in whose shadow his own career has always existed). You'll also find a fair bit about Dave Davies' guitars at his own website: http://www.davedavies.com/\n\nAll of which is by the by...\n\nBy Ray's account, the early Kinks stuff, up to and including \"You Really Got Me\" was recorded using Dave's Harmony Meteor and Ray's Gretsch Nashville copy. Perhaps it was the success of that track that spurred the purchase of new instruments - in Ray's case, the Fender Telecaster, which, along with his Fender Malibu acoustic and a Framus 12-string acoustic, became his principal guitar throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the first flush of the Kinks' success, old BBC footage shows Dave Davis with a number of fashionable guitars of the day - notably an Epiphone Casino, a Vox Phantom, and a Gretsch single-cutaway Country Gentleman (supposedly stolen at London Airport as they checked in for their flight for their first US tour).\n\n...but I'm waffling on a bit (sorry, I rather enjoy Kinksology).\n\nI think if you're considering Dave Davies' main guitars during the Kinks' most successful years, you can forget about the Epiphone Casino, and look instead towards his (early, prototype) Flying V, his Guild Starfire, and his Les Paul Custom Black Beauty.\n\nFor the best info, see:\n\nhttp://www.davedavies.com/guitars/index.htm\n\nhttp://www.davedavies.com/articles/tgm_0199-01.htm\n\nhttp://www.davedavies.com/guitars/intlmus1.htm\n\nAre there any other 60's band that played a lot of Casino's besides the beatles?? Looking for full albums full of them or tracks.\n\nAgree with the other comments here, re: the Rolling Stones.\n\nKeith Richards (Epiphone Casino) and Brian Jones (Gibson ES-330) were using these whilst John & George were still twangling their Rickenbackers...\n\nso any stones recorded tracks with definite casino on them?\n\nThe perceived wisdom is that the Rolling Stones purchased a fair few guitars during their first American tour in May and early June of 1964, amongst those was Keith's Epiphone Casino. So there is no need to consider Stones' recordings before that date.\n\nUsing recorded footage to match songs to guitars is futile. Much of that footage was lip-synced - and you can almost see the, \"Who cares what you're holding as long as it looks cool?\" attitude in those black & white TV clips of the Rolling Stones in their very early days. Strange guitars (sometimes Burns or Matons) appear for one performance only - presumably borrowed.\n\nGenuine live performances are more honest, to an extent. However, even though it looked as cool as can be - Brian Jones reportedly didn't like the way his Vox Teardrop performed very much, and kept a white Telecaster which he used extensively for recording, and which is often seen on a stand behind him in still photographs from gigs in 1963 and 1964, (I'll also bet a pound to a penny that it's the Telecaster you're hearing playing the famous lead line on \"The Last Time,\" not the Teardrop. Anyway, in late 1964 / early 1965, Brian Jones pretty much switched over to his Firebirds and ES-330.\n\nHowever - you asked about where the Casino cropped up on Stones Recordings. I think you'll find it all over \"12x5\" - where Keith used his Casino and Les Paul interchangeably. Also, Brian and Keith seemed to share guitars quite a lot (amongst other things) - so it's very possible that it turned up here and there in different places on that album. I'd swear that it crops up on a lot of the blusier stuff on \"Out of Our Heads,\" too. So, my advice would be to take a listen to \"12x5\" and \"Out of Our Heads\" and see what you think.\n\nAs a matter of interest, Keith hung on to that Casino until the early 1970s, whereupon it passed/was sold to Mick Taylor (who, to the best of my knowledge, never used it - at least not on Stones recordings.) Hence, it is possible that it turns up on other Stones stuff throughout the 1960s.\n\nKeith Richards with Epiphone Casino, \"Top of the Pops\" (BBC), 26th June 1964."
