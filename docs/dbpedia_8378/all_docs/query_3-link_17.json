Participants should prepare to challenge themselves in a safe and supportive environment with fun excercises using swing, blues, gospel, funk, and totally free grooves.\n\nSwing Harmony (Int-adv): Add to your harmony-singing toolbox in this class about swing harmony Ala Lambert Hendricks and Ross, The Andrew Sisters and others. We will take a simple song or two and add some colorful notes (6ths, 9ths etc) to get the sounds that compliment standard swing songs."
