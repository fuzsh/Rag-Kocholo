        "text": "AN AN UPDATE FROM DIRECTOR MARTIN DAVIES\n\n25.07.2020\n\n​\n\nIt`s been a long road, but we`re in the latter stages of post-production, been busy editing from hundreds of hours of footage shot over the last tours. We had a low budget of $9,000 for the project, so have done all the filming and editing , archive research myself..\n\nOver half of the budget has been spent on archive, mostly digitizing to High Definition old archive 8mm footage Dave filmed in the 1960s and 1970 - and it looks great! Much of the rest on equipment, software.\n\nAs well as filming dozens of shows/soundchecks/life on the road , i was tour managing - not always easy trying to film while dealing with promoters and overzealous fans :)\n\nThe film was originally going to be called Rock N Roll Journey, but Strangers seems more appropriate. The song has a special meaning to many people, and has become somewhat of a Kinks classic the last few years.\n\nThe\n\nI hope many would agree with me that Dave doesn`t get the credit he deserves for his contribution to rock n roll, hopefully a kickass documentary will help resolve that. It`s been wonderful to meet many of the film`s supporters on the road, your support has been greatly appreciated. Particular thanks to Rebecca G. Wilson, SImon Davies and all the musicians who`ve worked with Dave TPahPaPanj\n\nIt\n\nI`ll be sending a more detailed update soon to investors, but if you have any queries, please contact\n\nddstrangersfilm@gmail.com\n\n​\n\nWill be posting more content over the coming weeks!\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMORE ABOUT MARTIN\n\n​\n\nI`m Dave`s eldest son, born in 1967\n\nI worked for the Kinks and Ray at Konk studios from 2003 -2006\n\nI edited a documentary on the Arista years directed by Ray, i edited the To The Bone live video.\n\n2004 was a tough year - with Ray`s shooting and Dave`s stoke, but there were highlights managing the Kinks back catalogue, including the award-winning Village Green Preservation Society reissue.\n\nI worked on the release of Ray`s Other People`s Lives album, as well as doing editing and filming for Ray`s Americana documentary. I instigated and arranged the final reunion of the original Kinks line up for the 2005 UK Music Hall of Fame at Alexandra Palace, a memorable evening!\n\nIn 2010 Dave and I brought out the film Mystical Journey which covered Dave`s lifelong interest in metaphysics.\n\nI`ve been managing/tour managing Dave since 2014. Especially proud to help with bringing out the Decade album, a lot of time going through tapes! Also been great to help with the BMG special box-set reissues of Village Green, Arthur and the upcoming Lola 50th anniversary box-set.\n\nEarlier this year i digitized dozens of Dave`s home demo tapes, some of which we may use in Strangers and upcoming projects\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​"
