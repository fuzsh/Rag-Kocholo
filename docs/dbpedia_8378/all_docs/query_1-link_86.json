        "text": "Kinks Legend Dave Davies To Release New Album 'I Will BeMe' -\n\nThe man who forever changed the sound of rock 'n' roll when heinvented distortion, Kink's legend Dave Davies,has recorded a brand new solo album of all original material! To bereleased on CleopatraRecords on June 4th , 'I Will Be Me' featuresguest appearances by The Jayhawks, Anti-Flag, award winning UKblues guitarist Oli Brown, Chris Spedding, US stoner rock band DeadMeadow, Aussie rockers The Art, Geri X and others! In support ofDave's new album release, a special engagement of Live performancesin New York and Los Angeles are scheduled for the end of May tomid-June! (see below for complete list of shows)\n\nDave Davies founded the Kinks in the early 1960s and foreverchanged music after he sliced up the speaker cone of a little greenamp and created a revolutionary, distorted guitar tone and freneticsolo on the song \"You Really Got Me\". Musicologist Joe Harringtondescribed the Kinks influence: \" 'You Really Got Me', 'All Day AndAll Of The Night' ... were predecessors of the whole three-chordgenre ... The Kinks did a lot to help turn rock n roll into rock.\"In 1998, writer Bill Crowley wrote, \"As lead guitarist and founderof The Kinks, Dave Davies is one of the most unpredictable andoriginal forces in rock, without whom guitar-rock styles includingheavy metal and punk would have been inconceivable. A member of theRock & Roll Hall of Fame, Dave's massive guitar sounds haveinspired bands from Van Halen to Green Day.\"\n\nDave's new album 'I Will Be Me' is a return to hisgroundbreaking guitar sound and innovative songwriting. Hisclassically English voice shows off a new depth but still hits hisfamous high notes in this collection. The hard rocking track\"Livin' In The Past\", takes a look at obsession with all thingsretro but, ever the Mod, Dave surprises with the lyric, \"No matterwhat they do or say, the future's here to stay!\" He takes a lookback with \"Little Green Amp\", a playful, punk homage to days whenhis jagged, blues driven sound wave ripped ahead of the BritishInvasion through stereos the world over. \"Cote du Rhone (I Will BeMe)\", an uncensored look at ugliness in the world today, is asangry and biting as any song in Dave's repertoire with aninnovative yet heavy slide guitar tone. Soothing lyrics and soundsof Jonathan Lea's sitar playing on \"Healing Boy\" show Dave'ssensitive side. In a recent radio interview he said, \"Rock music isa positive force for good.\" This hopeful and optimistic visionmanifests and bridges themes personal, social and universal in'I Will Be Me'.\n\n'I Will Be Me'\n\n1.
