        "text": "Tokyo, March 30, 2006\n\nFujitsu Limited today announced that the ISO 14001(1) certification of its environmental management system, which the Japan-based operations of Fujitsu Limited and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries received on March 16, 2005, has now been expanded to cover its international consolidated subsidiaries, with Fujitsu receiving worldwide integrated certification on March 23, 2006.\n\nThe ISO 14001 certification of Fujitsu's environmental management system is the result of inspections by two separate certification organizations, covering Fujitsu's Japan-based and international operations, respectively. The certification of Fujitsu's environmental management system, which Fujitsu Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan received in March 2005, has now been expanded to cover its global consolidated subsidiaries outside of Japan. Fujitsu's environmental management system with worldwide integrated ISO 14001 certification covers Fujitsu Limited (98 locations), its 90 consolidated subsidiaries in Japan (503 locations), and now 11 subsidiaries(5) (22 locations) outside Japan, for a total of 102 companies (623 locations) that are primarily involved in manufacturing, representing some 117,000 employees in total (including some at affiliates).\n\nEstablishing an environmental management system geared towards Fujitsu's far-reaching global supply chain enables the company to strengthen the governance of, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its environmental activities.\n\nOver the past few years, environmental regulations on products have become stricter around the world. Recognizing the importance of having a common management structure to deal with these environmental regulations, in the fourth stage of the Environmental Protection Program of the Fujitsu Group(2), Fujitsu established the goal of creating, by the end of fiscal 2005, a group-wide integrated framework for its environmental management system, and has since been working to meet this goal.\n\nFujitsu's operations were inspected by two separate certification organizations, with operations in Japan audited by the Japan Audit and Certification Organization for Environmental Quality (JACO)(3) and operation overseas audited by Det Norske Veritas (DNV)(4). The new certification was received on March 23, 2006 (certificate number EC98J2005). Receiving a certificate with one certificate number demonstrates that the system is designed and operated as a single management system.\n\nEstablishing an environmental management system geared towards Fujitsu's expanding global supply chain enables the company to systematically share precise information regarding environmental management within its organization and strengthen governance in this area, thereby promoting efficient and effective environmental initiatives, including global warming countermeasures, elimination of hazardous chemical substances from products, and establishment of a product recycling system overseas.\n\nFujitsu has 34 non-manufacturing consolidated subsidiaries overseas whose environmental impact is relatively insignificant, and these companies are not covered by Fujitsu's worldwide integrated certification, but these companies are promoting environmental initiatives by establishing their own environmental management system based on Fujitsu's environmental policies.\n\nUsing its environmental management system, Fujitsu plans to strengthen its environmental initiatives during the final year of its Fourth Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan, and will continue to contribute to the development of a sustainable society.\n\nEnvironmental Management System Goals\n\n1. Strengthening environmental risk responsiveness in the supply-chain platform\n\nEstablishing this environmental management system enables Fujitsu to conduct product management in compliance with increasingly stringent product environmental regulations in a supply chain in which design is handled in Japan and manufacturing is handled overseas, enhancing the company's responsiveness to environmental risks, particularly issues relating to regulatory compliance.\n\n2. Improve group-wide governance on environmental matters\n\nThe environmental management system will enable the systematic collection and dissemination throughout the organization of essential information relating to environmental management, including the status of progress on the Fourth Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan, the status of regulatory compliance issues, and the status of communication with outside parties, such as inquiries from customers."
