        "text": "Singaporeâs Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will partner with Australian renewable energy firm, Dyesol Limited, to research and develop low-cost Dye Solar Cell (DSC) technology.\n\nDye Solar Cell (DSC), a nanotechnology that mimics photosynthesis to turn light into electricity under real world solar conditions, was invented by renowned photo-chemist Professor Michael GrÃ¤tzel, chairman of both the Energy Research Institute at NTUâs (ERI@N) International Advisory Board and Dyesolâs Technical Advisory Board.\n\nThe DSCâs applications and its related technological advancements will be the focus of this two-year collaboration between Dyesol and ERI@N.\n\nâThis agreement between ERI@N and Dyesol will unite the impressive technology base and experience of these two institutions and result in a powerful synergistic thrust, fostering new scientific breakthroughs and commercial applications,â said Professor Michael GrÃ¤tzel.\n\nExecutive Director of ERI@N, Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, said the collaboration with global DSC leader Dyesol demonstrates NTUâs continued efforts and commitment in clean energy as part of NTUâs research focus in sustainability, one of NTUâs Five Peaks of Excellence for which the university aims to make its global mark.\n\nâWith efficiencies already exceeding 12 per cent, DSC offers a viable alternative for cost-competitive energy harvesting solutions which may be readily integrated into buildings and consumer applications. We look forward to partnering with Dyesol and Professor GrÃ¤tzelâs research teams to develop high-efficiency and reliable solutions that will promote widespread adoption of these solar cells.â Professor Mhaisalkar said.\n\nIn addition to leading the mass-market commercialisation of DSC technology through collaborations with multinational manufacturers seeking to embed photovoltaic capability into their products, Dyesol is also working with leading universities and research institutes to advance DSC performance, capabilities and evaluate potential applications.\n\nâCollaborating with Singaporeâs NTU on DSC research will deliver significant benefits to Dyesol, including expanding expertise in âSolid State DSCâ and allowing both parties to leverage their expertise in a technology supportive environment,â said Dyesol Director, Gordon Thompson.\n\nERI@N is a global research and development centre that tackles issues and challenging questions on sustainable energies and energy efficiency.\n\nSupported by the Singapore Economic Development Board and other industry agencies, ERI@Nâs applied and translational research activities are supported by over 250 researchers from various backgrounds working in areas of wind/marine renewables, batteries, fuel cells, green building technologies, solar cells fuels, maritime clean energy, and electro-mobility.\n\nNTU has sealed important partnerships with several leading industry players such as Gamesa, Rolls-Royce Singapore, Robert Bosch GmbH (Bosch), Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Singapore Technologies Kinetics (STK), and Vestas Technology R&D Singapore (Vestas) in addition to collaborating with renowned universities such as the University of Cambridge, University of California Berkeley, Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) Switzerland and Imperial College London.\n\nSource: Nanyang Technological University"
