Røine, Director Business Development at Daphne Technology, and Fabian Kock, Head of Section Environmental Certification, DNV Maritime.\n\nA joint PRESS RELEASE from Daphne Technology and DNV.\n\nDaphne Technology's SlipPureTM solution is a novel technological approach to removing methane emissions from LNG-powered marine vessels' exhaust gas. LNG-fuelled engines emit methane, a process that causes unburnt methane, which is not fully combusted in the engines, to leak into the exhaust gas. Methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, a hazardous air pollutant and greenhouse gas.\n\nMethane slip has been significantly reduced in modern engines. However, it still remains a significant concern in operating LNG fuelled vessels. LNG carriers and LNG-fuelled ships will benefit from the Swiss - Norwegian company's methane abatement technology.\n\nSlipPureTM can also be combined with Carbon Capture technologies making IMO GHG 2050 goals achievable today.\n\nThe SlipPureTM solution has been awarded the AiP based on the DNV Rules for Classification of Ships 2021-07 Pt. 4 Ch. 1 (Machinery systems, general) and Pt. 4 Ch. 6 (Piping systems). DNV has reviewed the arrangements, drawings and relevant documentation and found no potential showstoppers to its installation onboard DNV classed vessels under its rules.\n\n\"The transition to sustainable energy sources is fundamentally reshaping the global economy. A dramatic reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is necessary to reach Real-Zero,\" says Dr Mario Michan, CEO and Founder of Daphne Technology. \"The Approval in Principle demonstrates that our technology can be installed on vessels meeting DNV's state of the art rules for the classification of ships, and is an important milestone for Daphne Technology, bringing us a step closer to deploying and commercialising our SlipPureTM system. We believe our technology can help address the climate challenge in the maritime and other hard-to-decarbonise industries.\"\n\n\"As the maritime industry continues its drive towards decarbonisation, the use of lower carbon intensity fuels is essential,\" said Martin Cartwright, Global Business Director Gas Carriers and FSRUs at DNV Maritime. \"LNG is a key transition fuel to cut GHGs and other emissions to air today, with the potential to become a net-zero option as more Bio- and E-LNG comes online. LNG fuelled vessel orders have developed rapidly over the last several years, and reducing their operational emission by reducing methane slip will only enhance the GHG benefits over conventionally fuelled vessels. This AIP shows Daphne Technology are committed to demonstrating that their solution rests on a foundation of the DNV rules, the most advanced technical standards in the maritime industry, and we look forward to continuing working with them on this innovative solution.\"\n\nAn Approval in Principle (AiP) is an independent assessment of a concept within an agreed framework, confirming that the design is feasible and no significant obstacles exist to prevent the concept from being realised.\n\nFigures: 3D model snaps from Feasibility Study of SlipPure™ system on LNG Carrier."
