It is desirable, therefore, to find and develop improved methods of reducing the discharge of C0 2 into the atmosphere.\n\nOne method involves sequestering, or storing, the C0 2 to keep it out of the atmosphere.\n\nC0 2 may be electrochemically converted into useful and marketable commodities, including, for example, methane, ethylene, cyclic carbonates, methanol, and formic acid or formate.\n\nOne C0 2 conversion process involves the electrochemical reduction of C0 2 (ECRC) to formic acid.\n\nECRC electrochemical reduction of C0 2\n\nFormic acid finds uses in replacing HC1 in steel pickling, traditional tanning of leather, formic acid-based fuel cells, as a storage medium for hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) that are then used as fuels and chemical feedstocks, conversion to sodium formate for airport runway deicing, preservatives and antibacterial agents, as an ingredient in bleaching pulp and paper, and as a precursor for organic synthesis, including pharmaceuticals.\n\nH 2 hydrogen\n\nCO carbon monoxide\n\nECRC involves a highly interrelated process. The entire process is based upon the balanced flow of electrons, ions in solution, and gas, as well as current density, and voltage, across the entire electrochemical reactor as well as across the individual reactor elements.\n\nC0 2 is reduced to end products at a cathode to which electrons are supplied via an external electrical connection by the oxidation of water or other compounds at an anode.\n\nthe anode and cathode are separated by a selective-ion membrane which allows certain ions to migrate from the anode to the cathode, thus completing the electrical circuit.\n\nchanges in one part of the cell can affect other parts.\n\nChanges to the anode can effect changes in VCELL (voltage across the entire reactor), current density, and the efficiency of conversion of C0 2 to products.\n\ndifferent cations and different anions, present in the catholyte and the anolyte can have different effects on catalytic behavior.\n\nan acid is added to the anolyte\n\nthe hydrogen ions (protons, H + ) from the anode migrate through the selective ion membrane to the catholyte, effecting the formation of formic acid at the cathode.\n\nsodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added to the anolyte, the sodium ions move across, forming sodium formate (HCOONa) as the end product.\n\nFE Faradaic Efficiency\n\nVarious embodiments of the present invention include a tin-based (Sn-based) cathode and methods of preparation of such cathode, tin-zinc (Sn-Zn) alloy-based cathodes, high surface area cathode fabrication, improved catholyte compositions, mixed metal oxide- catalyzed anodes in acidic anolytes, pulsed polarization of the anode and the cathode, and various configurations of three-compartment reactors, each of which provides improved performance of ECRC, particularly ECRC to formate and formic acid.\n\na process includes, in part, introducing C0 2 gas into a catholyte compartment of an electrochemical reactor where the catholyte compartment at least partially contains a cathode comprising a catalyst comprising a Sn-Zn alloy, the Zn comprising between about three weight percent and about six weight percent of the catalyst.\n\nan apparatus includes, in part, a cathode comprising a Sn-Zn alloy as just described and the catholyte compartment includes a mixture comprising a catholyte, gaseous carbon dioxide, and formate and formic acid.\n\na solution formulated to deposit Sn onto a porous, electrically conductive substrate includes a Sn salt, at least one complexing agent, optionally, an anti-oxidant, and a non-ionic surfactant.\n\na process includes immersing a porous, electrically conductive substrate into the solution just described, maintaining a temperature of the solution, and effecting a current density on the substrate.\n\na manufacture includes a porous, electrically conductive substrate with a Sn catalyst deposited thereon.\n\nthe Sn catalyst comprises Sn deposits having a grain size of between about 0.5 microns and about five microns, the deposits substantially covering an outer surface of the substrate.\n\na manufacture is formed by process for depositing Sn onto a substrate using a solution comprising a Sn salt, at least one complexing agent, optionally, an anti-oxidant, and a non-ionic surfactant.\n\na manufacture comprises a substrate comprising metallic foam, metallic felt, carbon fiber paper, or reticulated vitreous carbon.\n\na process includes introducing an anolyte into an anolyte compartment that contains an anode which comprises a substrate and a mixed metal oxide catalyst and also introducing C0 2 gas from a gas compartment into a catholyte compartment, where the catholyte compartment contains a catholyte and a cathode. Further, impressing a DC voltage across the anode and the cathode converts at least a portion of the C0 2 .\n\nthe anolyte is acidic and the C0 2 is converted to formic acid.\n\nthe anolyte is alkaline and at least a portion of the C0 2 is converted to formate.\n\nthe anode comprises a substrate comprising titanium (Ti), and the metal oxide comprises tantalum oxide (Ta 2 0 5 ) deposited onto the substrate, and iridium oxide (Ir0 2 ) deposited onto the tantalum oxide.\n\nthe cathode comprises a porous, electrically conductive substrate and a Sn-based catalyst.\n\nan apparatus includes a container, a membrane positioned within the container dividing the container into a catholyte compartment containing a cathode, and an anolyte compartment containing an anode, the anode comprising a substrate and a mixed metal oxide catalyst deposited upon the substrate.\n\na mixture comprising a catholyte and C0 2 gas is at least partially contained within the catholyte chamber\n\na voltage source is provided configured to impress a DC voltage across the anode and the cathode.\n\na process configured for ECRC to formate includes introducing into an anolyte compartment an anolyte, introducing into a catholyte compartment a catholyte comprising an aqueous solution of about 0.1M to about 2M of a compound selected from the following: potassium sulfate (K 2 S0 4 ) having a pH of about 6.5 and sodium sulfate (Na 2 S0 4 ) having a pH of 5.5.\n\nK 2 S0 4 potassium sulfate\n\nNa 2 S0 4 sodium sulfate\n\na process includes introducing an anolyte into an anolyte compartment of an electrochemical reactor, where the anolyte compartment at least partially contains an anode;

Similar elements with the vertical apparatus 200 are referenced similarly in the horizontal apparatus 300.\n\nthe alloys were acquired from Sophisticated Alloys, Inc, Butler, PA and were fabricated from pure (99.99 percent) element metals. Potentiostatic polarization at each potential was applied for two hours and formate concentrations analyzed with a DionexÂ® ion chromatograph (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Pure C0 2 gas 30 was continuously purged through a coil-form cathode 16b at 75 ml/min. The coils themselves were 40 cm long and 1 mm in diameter.\n\nthe catholyte 25 was 400 ml 2M KC1 and the anode 14 was Pt wire immersed in 1 M NaOH anolyte 24.\n\nFig. 5 shows the results of evaluating FE for several Sn-Zn alloy cathodic catalysts as well a pure Sn at values of -1.7 VSC E , -1.8 VSC E , and -1.9 VSC E -\n\nthe apparatus used for these tests was the vertical electrochemical half-cell 200 illustrated in Fig. 3 and described above.\n\nthe V SCE range was chosen to give the best FE, or selectivity of C0 2 to formate salts. Values below and above that range tend to decrease FE significantly. As shown in Fig.\n\nSnZn3 (Sn with three percent Zn), SnZn6 (Sn with six percent Zn), SnZn9 (Sn with nine percent Zn), and SnZn20 (Sn with 20 percent Zn) are all well behaved at the V SCE values of interest. That is, FE for each alloy changes little between -1.7 V SCE and -1.9 V SCE , thus allowing for more robust reactor operation over a broader V SCE range. In addition, SnZn3 and SnZn6 exhibit better FE than either SnZn9 or SnZn20, and SnZn9 shows better FE than SnZn20.\n\nSnZn3 and SnZn6 also exhibit better FE than pure Sn for -1.7 V SCE and -1.8 V SCE - There is, therefore, an unexpected benefit to operating at lower Zn levels and FE does not improve with increasing Zn content.\n\nFE In large reactors, with electrodes in the range of 1 m 2 , there exists a potential variation on the surface, but if the FE remains constant, the overall reactor FE will remain constant with the resultant more uniform product selectivity.\n\nthe Sn-Zn alloys as cathodic catalysts are combined with a catholyte formulated for ECRC to formate, which catholyte comprises 2M KC1.\n\nthe Sn-Zn alloys as cathodic catalysts are combined with anolytes formulated for ECRC to formate, which anolytes comprise 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.5M sulfuric acid (H 2 S0 4 ).\n\nthe Sn-Zn alloy cathodic catalysts are employed in a two-compartment electrochemical reactor, as shown in Fig. 2, and three-compartment electrochemical reactors, as shown in Fig. 7, and variations thereof as described herein below.\n\na two-compartment electrochemical reactor 100 is shown in which a container 12 encloses an anolyte compartment 18, an anode 14, during operation, anolyte 24, a membrane 22, a catholyte compartment 20, a cathode 16, and, during operation, a catholyte compartment mixture 26.\n\na two-phase catholyte/C0 2 feed (from catholyte feed 34 and C02 gas feed 32) is introduced into the catholyte compartment 20.\n\nthe catholyte compartment 20 contains the cathode 16, the anolyte compartment 18 contains the anode 14, and the catholyte compartment 20 and the anolyte compartment 18 are separated by the membrane 22.

Contained within the catholyte compartment 20, during operation, is the catholyte compartment mixture 26, which mixture comprises catholyte, C0 2 , and ECRC products such as formate and formic acid.\n\na three-compartment electrochemical reactor 350 is shown in which a three-compartment container 12a encloses an anolyte compartment 18, an anode 14, and, during operation, anolyte 24 contained within the anolyte compartment 18; a membrane 22; a catholyte compartment 20, a porous cathode 16a, and, during operation, catholyte compartment mixture 26 contained within the catholyte compartment 20; and a gas compartment 28, the gas compartment 28 containing, during operation, C0 2 gas 30.\n\nthe membrane 22 separates the anolyte compartment 18 and the catholyte compartment 20 and a porous cathode 16a separates the catholyte compartment from the gas compartment 28.\n\nan anolyte feed 36 introduces anolyte 24 into the anolyte compartment 18\n\nan anolyte withdrawal 44 removes anolyte 24 as well as other anode reaction products\n\na catholyte feed 34 introduces catholyte 25 into the catholyte compartment 20\n\na catholyte compartment mixture withdrawal 42 removes catholyte compartment mixture 26\n\na C0 2 gas feed 32 introduces C0 2 gas 30 into the gas compartment 28.\n\nthe porous cathode 16a may comprise a suitable cathodic catalyst, for example, one based upon Sn or a Sn-based alloy as described herein.\n\nthe porous cathode 16a may further comprise substrates and cathodic catalysts deposited as described herein.\n\na porous, electrically conductive material forms a substrate for the cathode 16a.\n\nthe substrate comprises carbon fiber paper (CFP).\n\nCFP carbon fiber paper\n\nFig. 8 is a photomicrograph of a sample of CFP showing the fiber pattern and Fig. 9 shows the same CFP at a higher magnification, as indicated.\n\nthe nominal diameter of the fibers is about 7.5 microns ( â ) to about 10 â and their length is in the hundreds of â .\n\nthe nominal thickness is about 370 â and the porosity ( â ) about 78.\n\nCFP provides a flow-through structure whereby C0 2 gas 30 in the gaseous feed stream 32 (see, e.g., Fig. 7) to the electrochemical reactor 350 (Fig. 7) flows through the thickness of the porous cathode 16a to the catholyte 25 where C0 2 is converted to formate/formic acid.\n\na porous material may be classified as three-dimensional (3D). That is, in addition to a length and width that define a two-dimensional superficial geometric area, the material also has more than nominal thickness.\n\na porous 3D cathode upon which a cathodic catalyst is deposited beyond the superficial geometric area will be capable of catalytically converting reactants to products in the interior of the cathode, interior to the superficial geometric area.\n\nthe CFP cathode discussed above herein with a nominal thickness of about 370 â , has shown deposits at a depth of about 25 â to about 35 â from each side into the interior of the superficial geometric area when fabricated as discussed herein below.\n\nFigs. 11 and 12 show the fiber pattern generally with the Sn deposited thereon.\n\nFig. 12 shows the same deposition, but at a higher magnification, as indicated.\n\nthe deposition apparatus 400 includes a fluid bath jacket 66 for temperature control and contains a deposition bath 72.\n\na magnetic stirring bar 68 mixes the bath 70 and a temperature probe 64 is inserted into the bath 72.\n\nthe apparatus 400 includes a reference electrode 58 and two counter electrodes 56 of Pt-coated Nb mesh, which, to avoid edge effects, are sized slightly larger than a cathode substrate material 70 attached to a working electrode 60, the onto which the Sn is be deposited.\n\nthe counter electrodes 56 are positioned in parallel to the working electrode 60.\n\na potentiostat 54 supplies constant current density between the working electrode 60 and the counter electrodes 56, where the working electrode 60 is negatively charged during the deposition.\n\na current density of about 2.5 mA/cm 2 was used based upon the superficial geometric area.\n\na rectangular substrate material 70 having a length of about 3 cm and a width of about 3.3 cm would have a superficial geometric area of about 10 cm 2 .\n\na circular substrate material 70 would have a diameter of 2.54 cm for a 5 cm 2 superficial geometric area.\n\nthe temperature of the bath 72 was maintained between about 50 deg. C and about 55 deg. C. Time of deposition ranged from 30 min. to about 1.5 hr.\n\nthe deposition bath 72 was as follows:\n\nthe entire process included wetting the cathode substrate material 70 by immersion in ethanol for about 30 sec. to improve wettability, electrodepositing Sn onto the substrate 70 as described herein above, removing the substrate 70 from the bath 72 and immersing the substrate 70 into a large quantity of distilled water, immersing the substrate 70 into deionized (DI) water, cleaning in an ultrasonic cleaner for about three min., rinsing with DI water and slowly blow drying with (nitrogen (N 2 ) gas. (See Fig. 11 and 12.)\n\na cathode prepared as above under Method One was tested in a three-compartment reactor as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nthe cathode comprised a CFP substrate and Sn deposited as described herein above under Method One and had a superficial geometric area of 10 cm 2 .\n\nC0 2 gas flowrates were between 226 ml/min and 550 ml/min.\n\nthe catholyte was C0 2 pre-saturated 2M KC1, with flowrates in the range of between 2.25 ml/min and 2.5 ml/min.\n\nthe anolyte was IM KOH with flowrates of between 40 ml/min and 80 ml/min.\n\nSn was deposited onto CFP using the deposition apparatus 400 shown in Fig. 10 and as described herein above. Further, the operating parameters were the same, except the temperature was between 55 and 65 deg. C, and the time of deposition was between one and two hours.\n\nthe deposition bath may comprise a tin salt, at least one complexing agent, an anti-oxidant, and a non-ionic surfactant. Specifically, the deposition bath comprised:\n\nFig. 13, 14, and 15 show a dense, uniform coating.\n\nFig. 13 shows the fiber pattern generally with the Sn deposited thereon.\n\nFig. 14 shows the same deposition, but at a higher magnification as indicated showing the individual Sn grains.\n\nFig. 15 shows Sn deposited onto a Ni foam.\n\nthe Ni foam used was IncofoamÂ® (No- vamet Specialty Products, Wyckoff, NJ). The photomicrograph was focused on the interior of the foam, so the grains in the background are more defined.\n\na cathode prepared as above under Method Two was also tested in a three- compartment reactor as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nthe cathode comprised a CFP substrate and Sn deposited as described herein above under Method Two and had a superficial geometric area of 10 cm 2 .\n\nC0 2 gas flowrate was 70 ml/min.\n\nthe catholyte was C0 2 pre-saturated 2M KC1, with flowrates between 7 and 8 ml/min and the anolyte was 1M KOH.\n\nthe anode was Pt- coated Nb mesh.\n\nV CELL was between 2.6 V and 4.0 V.\n\nthe C0 2 gas and catholyte flowrates were controlled by a gas/liquid (G/L) ratio. As shown in Fig.\n\nMethod Two appears to provide superior results compared with Method One.\n\nthe cathode prepared by Method One achieved a current density of 45 mA/cm 2\n\nthe cathode prepared by Method Two achieved a current density of 75 mA/cm 2 . While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the increased coverage of Sn, and a more uniform deposit of finer grains (see, Figs. 1 1 and 12 versus 13 and 14), contributed to the observed improvement.\n\na process which includes improved catholyte compositions for ECRC to formate.\n\nFig. 18 illustrates the short-time (2 hours) performance of a pure Sn coil electrode in selected catholytes in a vertical half-cell as shown in Fig. 3. Pure C02 gas was continuously purged through a 40 cm long, 1 mm diameter coil cathode at 75 ml/min. The anode was Pt wire which was immersed in an anolyte of 1M NaOH.\n\nKCl at a pH of 5.5\n\n2M NaCl at a pH of 5.3\n\n0.5M Na 2 S0 4 at a pH of 5.5\n\nOther catholytes tested include 0.5M KHC0 3 at a pH of 7.5, 2M KCl at a pH of 2.5, and K 2 S0 4 at a pH of 6.5\n\na process which includes an ECRC process comprising introducing an anolyte into an anolyte compartment, the anolyte compartment containing a metal oxide catalyst.\n\nthe anolyte is acidic and the anode comprises a mixed metal oxide catalyst.\n\nFig. 19 shows current density (mA/cm 2 ) for a mixed metal oxide anode in an acidic anolyte.\n\nthe apparatus shown in Fig. 7 was used to develop the data in Fig. 19.\n\nthe anolyte used was 0.5M H 2 S0 4 at a flowrate of 45 ml/min.\n\nthe catholyte was 2M KCl pre-saturated with C0 2 before introduction into the reactor at a flowrate of between 5 and 10 ml/min.\n\nthe C02 flowrate was maintained at between 69 and 84 ml/min.\n\nthe cathode used for all of the experiments was Sn deposited onto CFP as described herein above under Deposition Method One.\n\nVCELL applied between the anode and the cathode was varied between 3.25 V and 4.25 V and the current densities measured.\n\nCatholyte samples were collected periodically and evaluated for the concentration of formic acid.\n\nthe pH of the catholyte samples were first increased to 7 from the original catholyte values of between 2 and 3 using NaOH in order to convert all formic acid to formate ions.\n\nAn Ion Chro- matograph was used to measure the concentration of formate ions.\n\nalkaline solutions e.g., KOH and NaOH\n\nH + ions are formed and transported across the cation exchange membrane. This allows for the direct formation of formic acid on the cathode side rather than formate ions as in the alkaline anolyte case.\n\nFig. 19 current density (mA/cm 2 ) is plotted against total cell voltage (V CELL ) for several anodes in an acidic environment as discussed herein above.\n\nMixed metal oxide (MMO) is an electrode with a Ti plate substrate, a Ta 2 0 5 layer deposited upon the substrate, and an Ir0 2 layer deposited upon the Ta 2 0 5 layer (Ti/Ta 2 0 5 /Ir0 2 ).\n\nthe material was acquired from NMT Electrodes Pty Ltd, Ashwood, ZA.\n\nPt-coated Nb mesh is an electrode acquired from Anomet Products, Shrewsbury, MA.\n\nthe Ni and 316 stainless steel (SS316) were flat metal plates. Both the Ni and SS316 anodes exhibited pitting corro- sion and dissolution during ECRC.\n\nMMO exhibited improved performance over Pt-Nb mesh and reduced V CELL at constant current density.\n\nFIG. 21 Current Density versus V CELL is shown for various mixed metal oxides and several other anode materials.\n\nthe apparatus used for these tests is the three-compartment reactor shown in Fig. 7 under continuous operation.\n\nthe indicated PTA mesh is an OPTIMATM PTA Series platinum-plated, clad, and thermally deposited anode.\n\nthe substrate is titanium. (Siemens AS, Water Technologies, Warrendale, PA.)\n\nthe Ir0 2 on Ti plate was also acquired from NMT Electrodes Pty Ltd.\n\nthe Ir0 2 , Ta 2 0 5 bilayer on Ti plate was also acquired from NMT.\n\nmomentary pulsed polarization restores FE that has degraded over time.\n\nHigh FE at high current densities at the cathode over extended times is desirable for ECRC.\n\nblack deposits can form on metal electrodes, including pure Sn.\n\npure Sn and Sn-alloy coil cathodes discussed herein above in runtimes up to 20 hours in a half-cell, no deposits were found.\n\nblack deposits with differing amounts were generally found on electrodes of pure Sn and Sn-based alloys after more than 20 hours at a current density of about 10 mA/cm 2 .\n\nDCP deep cathodic polarization\n\nAP anodic polarization\n\ncombinations thereof were utilized to remove the black deposits from long runtime pure Sn wire.\n\nPolarization was carried out in 2M KC1 at different pHs (adjusted with HC1 and/or C0 2 ).\n\nAP was 100 mA/cm 2 for 30 seconds\n\nDCP was -100 mA/cm 2 for 30 seconds\n\nthe combined AP/DCP was for 100 mA/cm 2 and -100 mA/cm 2 , respectively, each for 30 seconds.\n\nFig. 23 illustrates the FE of used pure Sn electrode before and after these different polarization treatments. Tests were performed in the vertical half-cell testing apparatus shown in Fig. 3. The cathode was in coil form. The catholyte was 2M KCL and the anolyte was 1M NaOH. The top dashed line is the average high FE of the original pure Sn cathode before FE degradation due to the coverage of black deposits.\n\nthe bottom dash-dot line is the average low FE of the original pure Sn cathode before polarization treatment.\n\nthe square symbols identify the FEs of the polarization-treated Sn cathode, which were similar to the top dashed line, an indication that full recovery of FE is achieved by polarization treatments.\n\nthe cathodes used in the above experiments were relatively small compared with a large-scale commercial unit, where baseline current densities on the order of 100 mA/cm 2 to 500 mA/cm 2 would be found.\n\nAP pulses on the order of 500 m /em and 5000 mA/cm 2 , respectively, and that of DCP pulses would be on the order of -500 mA/cm 2 and -5000 mA/cm 2 , respectively.\n\nthe current density of AP pulses is a posi- tive current density about ten times the current density effected by the impressed DC voltage across the anode and the cathode.\n\nthe current density of DCP pulses is a negative current density about ten times she current density effected by she impressed DC voltage across the anode and the cathode.\n\nAP pulses and DCP pulses may also be applied sequentially.\n\nthe pulses are infrequent and of short duration, typically between about five and about 120 seconds every two to ten hours, or, generally, between about 0.3 percent and 1.7 percent of the interval between applications. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these polarization methods may dissolve small amounts of Sn for forming Sn-hydride, which is unstable. In the process, the black deposits are removed from the cathode.\n\nFig. 24 shows a three-compartment reactor 350, and is a modification of Fig. 7 as discussed herein above. Further included is a porous, absorbent, nonconductive pad 46, such as foam or felt, adjacent to the porous cathode 16a.\n\nthe porous, absorbent, nonconductive pad 46 in contact with the porous cathode 16a prevents the formation of a gas layer near the porous cathode 16a which can break the continuity in the electrolyte. Good results have been obtained with plain-backed 1/8 -inch-thick wool felt sheet (Item 8341K31, McMaster- Carr, Aurora, OH).\n\nFig. 25 shows a three-compartment reactor 360, and is a modification of Fig.\n\nFig. 26 shows a three-compartment reactor 370, is a modification of Fig. 25, further including a diffuser 48 adjacent the porous cathode 16a on the gas compartment side of the porous cathode 16a. Good results were obtained with a PTFE-coated porous material which facilitates the distribution of the C0 2 gas 30.\n\nthe diffuser 48 is fabricated to allow not only C0 2 gas 30 traversing the
