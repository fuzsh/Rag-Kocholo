        "text": "DNV RP-F116 integrity management of submarine pipeline system\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLeinum, B.H.; Etterdal, B. [Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Hoevik (Norway); Augustinovic, Z. [Dong Energy, Fredericia (Denmark); Paula, A. [Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Rio de Janeiro, RJ (Brazil)\n\n2009-12-19\n\nThe need to keep pipelines operating safely and efficiently is paramount for any operator. Additionally, there is an increasing awareness at both regulatory and public level. Authorities around the world are adopting a more proactive approach as they seek to minimize the risk of human injuries or harm to the environment resulting from pipeline leaks. A joint industry project (JIP) led by DNV Energy is formulating guidelines for how to manage the integrity of submarine pipeline system. The resultant document of recommended practice, DNV RP-F116, will provide the oil and gas industry with a useful tool in an area where no such formal guidance currently exists. This paper gives an overview of the RP and demonstrates the use with a case study for the Siri field. The Siri field is operated by DONG Energy, Denmark and all infield pipelines were subjected to an integrity assessment using the Integrity Management process as outlined in the upcoming DNV RP-116. In parallel with establishing the RP, DNV has further developed the web-based software system, Orbit+, which is aligned with the RP. The software system is implemented and used by Dong Energy.

The role of RP105 in vascular remodeling, in particular post-interventional remodeling is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: TLR4 and RP105 are expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC as well as in the media of murine femoral artery segments as detected by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the response to the TLR4 ligand LPS was stronger in VSMC from RP105(-/- mice resulting in a higher proliferation rate. In RP105(-/- mice femoral artery cuff placement resulted in an increase in neointima formation as compared to WT mice (4982 Â± 974 Âµm(2 vs.1947 Â± 278 Âµm(2,p = 0.0014. Local LPS application augmented neointima formation in both groups, but in RP105(-/- mice this effect was more pronounced (10316Â±1243 Âµm(2 vs.4208 Â± 555 Âµm(2,p = 0.0002, suggesting a functional role for RP105. For additional functional studies, the extracellular domain of murine RP105 was expressed with or without its adaptor protein MD1 and purified. SEC-MALSanalysis showed a functional 2â¶2 homodimer formation of the RP105-MD1 complex. This protein complex was able to block the TLR4 response in whole blood ex-vivo. In vivo gene transfer of plasmid vectors encoding the extracellular part of RP105 and its adaptor protein MD1 were performed to initiate a stable endogenous soluble protein production. Expression of soluble RP105-MD1 resulted in a significant reduction in neointima formation in hypercholesterolemic mice (2500 Â± 573 vs.6581 Â± 1894 Âµm(2,p<0.05, whereas expression of the single factors RP105 or MD1 had no effect. CONCLUSION: RP105 is a potent inhibitor of post-interventional neointima formation.\n\nDNV launches new recommended practice for design of subsea equipment\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nToerstad, Elisabeth Heggelund\n\n2005-07-01\n\nThe application of modern corrosion-resistant alloys to subsea pipelines and components has led to serious problems of hydrogen embrittlement from the corrosion protection system, resulting in cracks and leaks. The most commonly known incidents of this kind are the duplex hubs on Voinhaven, UK and Garn West and the 13% Cr pipelines on Tune and Aasgard, all at the Norwegian shelf. Understanding the nature of this problem has called for a broad multidisciplinary approach, involving expertise on corrosion and metallurgy as well as structural design and integrity. Competence in probabilistic analyses and risk assessments has also been necessary in order to set acceptance criteria and evaluate probability of failure for existing installations. (Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is now about to issues a Recommended Practise (RP) for design of subsea equipment in duplex steels under Cathodic Protection. The RP is based on knowledge gained through failure investigations, qualification pr grams and research work, and a broad industry consortium has contributed with experience and knowledge. Hydrogen Induced Stress Cracking (HISC) due to hydrogen from the Cathodic Protection (CP) system has been one of the most frequent and costly failure modes for subsea equipment and pipelines in the North Sea over the recent years. Today, the international oil business is looking to Norway for assistance in establishing detailed knowledge about and preventive measures against this failure mode. A significant research work is currently being carried out jointly by DNV, SINTEF and TWI (The Welding Institute), supported by a broad industry consortium - aiming at a better understanding of the HISC (Hydrogen Induced Stress Cracking) mechanism and establishment of test methods which reflect the sensitivity to cracking. DNV has also established a Recommended Practice, which will be issued late 2005. It reflects the experience gained from the failure examinations, fitness for purpose evaluations, research\n\nFatigue life assessment of free spanning pipelines containing corrosion defects\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLopes, Rita de Kassia D.; Campello, Georga C.; Matt, Cyntia G. da Costa; Benjamin, Adilson C.; Franciss, Ricardo [PETROBRAS S.A., Rio de Janeiro, RJ (Brazil). Centro de Pesquisas (CENPES)\n\n2009-12-19\n\nThe free spanning pipelines assessment is a highlighted issue to be considered during the project and maintenance of the submarine pipelines. It is required to evaluate the fatigue life and the maximum stress due to VIV (Vortex Induced Vibration) as well as wave forces when applicable in case of shallow water. The code DNV-RP-F105 (2006) presents a methodology to calculate the fatigue life for free spanning pipelines. Such methodology however considers the pipe with no kind of defects. Nevertheless, sometimes corrosion defects are detected in periodic inspections and therefore their effects need to be taken into account in the fatigue life evaluation. The purpose of this paper thus is to present a procedure to assess the influence of the corrosion defects in the fatigue life of free spanning pipelines. Some FE analyses were performed to determine the stress concentrate factor (SCF) of the corrosion defects, which were used as input in the methodology presented in the code DNV-RP-F105 (2006). Curves of damage and so lifetime have been generated as function of the span length and water depth. As a practical application, this methodology was applied to a sub sea pipeline with several corrosion defects, localized in shallow water offshore Brazil.

The crystal structure of the bovine 1:1 RP105-MD-1 complex bound to a putative endogenous lipid at 2.9 Ã resolution shares a similar overall architecture to its homolog TLR4-MD-2 but assembles into an unusual 2:2 homodimer that differs from any other known TLR-ligand assembly. The homodimer is assembled in a head-to-head orientation that juxtaposes the N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) of the two RP105 chains, rather than the usual tail-to-tail configuration of C-terminal LRRs in ligand-activated TLR dimers, such as TLR1-TRL2, TLR2-TLR6, TLR3-TLR3 and TLR4-TLR4. Another unusual interaction is mediated by an RP105-specific asparagine-linked glycan, which wedges MD-1 into the co-receptor binding concavity on RP105. This unique mode of assembly represents a new paradigm for TLR complexes and suggests a molecular mechanism for regulating LPS responses.\n\nKSC Center Director Bridges accepts an ISO 9001 certificate from DNV\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nCenter Director Roy Bridges displays the ISO 9001 certificate he was awarded by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Inc., an international ISO certification organization, at a ceremony at KSC.

TLR4-mediated activation of pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes is crucial for effective neovascularization. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that RP105+ monocytes are present in the perivascular space of remodeling collateral arterioles. As RP105 inhibits TLR4 signaling, we hypothesized that RP105 deficiency would lead to an unrestrained TLR4-mediated inflammatory response and hence to enhanced blood flow recovery after ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: RP105-/- and wild type (WT mice were subjected to hind limb ischemia and blood flow recovery was followed by Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging. Surprisingly, we found that blood flow recovery was severely impaired in RP105-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry showed that arteriogenesis was reduced in these mice compared to the WT. However, both in vivo and ex vivo analyses showed that circulatory pro-arteriogenic Ly6Chi monocytes were more readily activated in RP105-/- mice. FACS analyses showed that Ly6Chi monocytes became activated and migrated to the affected muscle tissues in WT mice following induction of hind limb ischemia. Although Ly6Chi monocytes were readily activated in RP105-/- mice, migration into the ischemic tissues was hampered and instead, Ly6Chi monocytes accumulated in their storage compartments, bone marrow and spleen, in RP105-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: RP105 deficiency results in an unrestrained inflammatory response and monocyte over-activation, most likely due to the lack of TLR4 regulation. Inappropriate, premature systemic activation of pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes results in reduced infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes in ischemic tissues and in impaired blood flow recovery.\n\nRP105 Protects Against Apoptosis in Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Myocardial Damage in Rats by Suppressing TLR4-Mediated Signaling Pathways\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJun Yang\n\n2015-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Myocardial apoptosis is heavily implicated in the myocardial damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4 is a potent inducer of these apoptotic cascades. In contrast, the radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105 is a specific negative regulator of TLR4 signaling pathways. However, the precise mechanisms by which RP105 inhibits myocardium apoptosis via TLR4-associated pathways during I/R is not fully understood. Methods: We utilized a rat model of myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury (MIRI. Animals were pre-treated with Ad-EGFP adenovirus, Ad-EGFP-RP105 adenovirus, saline, or nothing (sham. After three days, rats underwent a 30min left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and a 4h reperfusion. Mycardial tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry, TUNEL-staining, Western blot, quantitative RT-PCR, and a morphometric assay. Results: RP105 overexpression resulted in a reduction in infarct size, fewer TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes, and a reduction in mitochondrial-associated apoptosis cascade activity. Further, RP105 overexpression repressed I/R-induced myocardial injury by attenuating myocardial apoptosis. This was mediated by inhibiting TLR4 activation and the phosphorylation of P38MAPK and the downstream transcription factor AP-1. Conclusion: RP105 overexpression leads to the de-activation of TLR4, P38MAPK, and AP-1 signaling pathways, and subsequently represses apoptotic cascades and ensuing damage of myocardial ischemic reperfusion. These findings may become the basis of a novel therapeutic approach for reducing of cardiac damage caused by MIRI.\n\nFactors influencing infection and transmission of Anopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV in mosquitoes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTapan K. Barik\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Anopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV is a potential microbial agent for paratransgenesis and gene transduction in An. gambiae, the major vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the interaction between AgDNV and An. gambiae is critical for using AgDNV in a basic and applied manner for Anopheles gene manipulation. Here, we tested the effects of mosquito age, sex, blood feeding status, and potential for horizontal transmission using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP reporter AgDNV system. Neither mosquito age at infection nor feeding regime affected viral titers. Female mosquitoes were more permissive to viral infection than males. Despite low viral titers, infected males were able to venereally transmit virus to females during mating, where the virus was localized with the transferred sperm in the spermathecae. These findings will be useful for designing AgDNV-based strategies to manipulate Anopheles gambiae.\n\nFactors influencing infection and transmission of Anopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV) in mosquitoes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarik, Tapan K; Suzuki, Yasutsugu; Rasgon, Jason L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV) is a potential microbial agent for paratransgenesis and gene transduction in An. gambiae , the major vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

The RP105â MD-1 complex has been proposed to play a role in fine-tuning the innate immune response to endotoxin such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via TLR4â MD-2, but controversy surrounds its mechanism. We have used atomically detailed simulations to reveal the structural basis for ligand binding and consequent functional dynamics of MD-1 and the RP105 complex. We rationalize reports of endogenous phospholipid binding, by showing that they prevent collapse of the malleable MD-1 fold, before refining crystallographic models and uncovering likely binding modes for LPS analogs. Subsequent binding affinity calculations reveal that endotoxin specificity arises from the entropic cost of expanding the MD-1 cavity to accommodate bulky lipid tails, and support the role of MD-1 as a \"sink\" that sequesters endotoxin from TLR4 and stabilizes RP105/TLR4 interactions.

During the basic design, the free span assessment was performed considering the maximum allowable free span length determined by the response model proposed by DNV-RP-F105. This approach resulted in a large number of predicted free span requiring corrections, leading to a higher capital cost for the project. In this sense, a detailed free span VIV fatigue assessment was proposed, considering multi-spans and multi-mode effects and also the post lay survey data. The assessment followed the DNV-RP-F105 recommendations for multi-spans and multi-mode effects, using Finite Element Analysis to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes and corresponding stresses associated with the mode shapes. The assessment was performed in three stages, the first during the detailed design as part of the bottom roughness analysis using the expected residual pipelay tension. The second stage was performed after pipelay, considering the post-lay survey data, where the actual requirements for span correction were determined. Actual pipelay tension was used and seabed soil stiffness adjusted in the model to match the as-laid pipeline profile obtained from the survey data. The first and second stage assessments are seamlessly automated to speed up the evaluation process and allow for quick response in the field, which was important to keep the construction vessel time minimized. The third stage was performed once the corrections of the spans were made and the purpose was to confirm that the new pipeline configuration along the supported spans had sufficient fatigue life for the temporary and operational phases. For the assessment of all three stages, the probability of occurrence and directionality of the near bottom current was considered to improve prediction of the\n\n5 CFR 5502.105 - Agency procedures.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-01-01\n\n....105 Administrative Personnel DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Â§ 5502.105 Agency procedures.

The reactor blocks will remain in a safe storage mode for up to 75 years as identified in the Record the Decision (ROD) (58 FR 48509) for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Decommissioning of Eight Surplus Production Reactors at the Hanford Site, Richland, Washington (DOE 1992a). This EE/CA also addresses final disposition of four ancillary facilities: 116-D and 116-DR Exhaust Air Stacks, 117-DR Exhaust Filter Building, and 119-DR Exhaust Air Sample Building. The 105-DR and 105-F facilities are located in the 100-D and 100-F Areas of the Hanford Site. In November 1989, the 100 Area of the Hanford Site was placed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). The 100 Area NPL includes the 100-D Area (which includes the 100-DR site) and the 100-F Area, which are in various stages of the remediation process. It has been determined by DOE that hazardous substances in the 105-DR, 105-F, and the four ancillary facilities may present a potential threat to human health or the environment, and that a non-time critical removal action at these facilities is warranted. To help determine the most appropriate action, DOE, in cooperation with the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) and the EPA, has prepared this EE/CA. The scope of the evaluation includes the 105-DR and 105-F facilities and the four ancillary facilities.

These buildings and facilities are located in the 100-D/DR and 100-F Areas of the Hanford Site, which is owned and operated by the US Department of Energy (DOE), in Benton County, Washington. The 100 Areas (including the 100-D/DR and 100-F Areas) of the Hanford Site were placed on the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Priorities List under the ''Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980'' (CERCLA). The DOE has determined that hazardous substances in the 105-DR and 105-F Reactor buildings and four ancillary facilities present a potential threat to human health or the environment. The DOE has also determined that a non-time critical removal action is warranted at these facilities. Alternatives for conducting a non-time critical removal action were evaluated in the ''Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis for the 105-DR and 105-F Reactor Facilities and Ancillary Facilities'' (DOE-RL 1998a). The engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) resulted in the recommendation to decontaminate and demolish the contaminated reactor buildings (except for the reactor blocks) and the ancillary facilities and to construct a safe storage enclosure (SSE) over the reactor blocks. The recommendation was approved in an action memorandum (Ecology et al. 1998) signed by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), EPA, and DOE. The DOE is the agency responsible for implementing the removal actions in the 105-D/DR and 105-F Areas.

High presure and temperature lead to axial tension appearence along the pipeline. Interaction between soil and the surface of pipeline trigering frictional resistance which holding axial force on the pipeline and could cause the occurence of global buckling. According to DNV RP F110, global buckling may occur in several directions which one of them is in the lateral direction. Lateral buckling usually occurs only in the exposed pipe which occurs when the compressive force on the pipe imperfection released at one point so that the excess force in the slip zone turn into buckling. According to DNV RP F 110, there are three methods of analysis that can be used to perform the analysis of lateral buckling the pipe. Those are methods of Hobbs, Van GAF, and Spinazle. In this paper, lateral buckling analysis performed on a 7.67 km subsea gas pipeline by using Hobbs method which concluded that the pipeline has the potential to lateral buckling. Analysis by using software ABAQUS was also carried out to determine the location of the lateral buckling which is the location where overstressed occur.\n\nFinal Hazard Classification and Auditable Safety Analysis for the 105-F Building Interim Safe Storage Project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRodovsky, T.J.; Bond, S.L.\n\n1998-07-01\n\nThe auditable safety analysis (ASA) documents the authorization basis for the partial decommissioning and facility modifications to place the 105-F Building into interim safe storage (ISS). Placement into the ISS is consistent with the preferred alternative identified in the Record of Decision (58 FR). Modifications will reduce the potential for release and worker exposure to hazardous and radioactive materials, as well as lower surveillance and maintenance (S ampersand M) costs. This analysis includes the following: A description of the activities to be performed in the course of the 105-F Building ISS Project. An assessment of the inventory of radioactive and other hazardous materials within the 105-F Building. Identification of the hazards associated with the activities of the 105-F Building ISS Project. Identification of internally and externally initiated accident scenarios with the potential to produce significant local or offsite consequences during the 105-F Building ISS Project.

Confirmation of an association of phytoplasmas with diseased plants was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR assays having the phytoplasma universal primer pairs P1/P7 followed by R16F2n/ R16R2 in nested PCR. Then, for detection of 'Ca. P. asteris', DNA samples were subjected to amplification of rp and tuf genes using specific primer pairs rp(IF1A/rp(IR1A and fTufAy/rTufAy, respectively. Restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP analyses of rp gene fragments using Tsp509I restriction enzyme as well as sequence analyses indicated that 'Ca. P. asteris'-related phytoplasmas associated with carrot, niger seed and scallion plants in these regions, belong to the rpI-L subgroup. This research is the first report of carrot, niger seed, and scallion infection with phytoplasmas belonging to the rpI-L subgroup.\n\nTechnology qualification of an ambient pressure subsea cryogenic pipeline for offshore LNG loading and receiving terminals\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHussain, Afzal; Viteri, Martha; D' Angelo, Luis [Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Rio de Janeiro, RJ (Brazil); Prescott, Neal; Zhang, Jeff [Fluor Corporation, Irving, TX (Brazil)\n\n2009-07-01\n\nA project that deploys new technologies need to be confident that the technology can be implemented successfully and will perform reliably as designed. New technology is critical to industry, especially where such technology is a project enable without the existence of a backup solution, but also for projects where such technologies bring potential benefits such as technical, economic, schedule, and environmental improvements. DNV developed and has been implementing for many years a systematic, risk based technology qualification process as described in DNV RP-A203, qualification procedures for new technology. One of the major objectives of a formal technology qualification process is to ensure that risks are properly addressed. The DNV process includes several levels of technology qualification and review, starting with a statement of feasibility and concluding with a Certificate of Fitness for Service. Fluor Corporation (Fluor) has developed a new subsea cryogenic pipe-in-pipe configuration for offshore LNG loading and receiving terminals. The configuration uses a highly efficient thermal nano-porous insulation in the annular space between the inner and outer pipes. This material is kept in an ambient pressure environment, which is produced through sealing by metal bulkheads. The bulkheads transfer the contraction induced axial compression load on the inner cryogenic carrier pipe to the external jacket pipe. The resulting pipeline bundle is a structural element, which addresses the thermal contraction and expansion loads without the use of expansion bellows or ultra-low thermal contraction alloys. Fluor has followed the DNV technology qualification process to achieve the defined milestones therein which culminated in DNV issuing a certificate of fitness for service. Particular focus was put on the new aspects of the design. The certificate of fitness for service for the Fluor subsea LNG pipe technology provides project management with the confidence that this\n\n47 CFR 65.105 - Discovery.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 47 Telecommunication 3 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Discovery. 65.105 Section 65.105...

The 33 dominant mutations and 6 recessive RP1 mutations identified to date are all nonsense or frameshift mutations, and almost exclusively (38 out of 39 are located in the 4(th and final exon of RP1. To better understand the underlying disease mechanisms of and help develop therapeutic strategies for RP1 disease, we performed a series of human genetic and animal studies using gene targeted and transgenic mice. Here we report that a frameshift mutation in the 3(rd exon of RP1 (c.686delC; p.P229QfsX35 found in a patient with recessive RP1 disease causes RP in the homozygous state, whereas the heterozygous carriers are unaffected, confirming that haploinsufficiency is not the causative mechanism for RP1 disease. We then generated Rp1 knock-in mice with a nonsense Q662X mutation in exon 4, as well as Rp1 transgenic mice carrying a wild-type BAC Rp1 transgene. The Rp1-Q662X allele produces a truncated Rp1 protein, and homozygous Rp1-Q662X mice experience a progressive photoreceptor degeneration characterized disorganization of photoreceptor outer segments. This phenotype could be prevented by expression of a normal amount of Rp1 protein from the BAC transgene without removal of the mutant Rp1-Q662X protein. Over-expression of Rp1 protein in additional BAC Rp1 transgenic lines resulted in retinal degeneration. These findings suggest that the truncated Rp1-Q662X protein does not exert a toxic gain-of-function effect. These results also imply that in principle gene augmentation therapy could be beneficial for both recessive and dominant RP1 patients, but the levels of RP1 protein delivered for therapy will have to be carefully controlled.\n\nRP-2 Thermal Stability and Heat Transfer Investigation for Hydrocarbon Boost Engines\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVanNoord, J. L.; Stiegemeier, B. R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA series of electrically heated tube tests were performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center s Heated Tube Facility to investigate the use of RP-2 as a fuel for next generation regeneratively cooled hydrocarbon boost engines. The effect that test duration, operating condition and test piece material have on the overall thermal stability and materials compatibility characteristics of RP-2 were evaluated using copper and 304 stainless steel test sections. The copper tests were run at 1000 psia, heat flux up to 6.0 Btu/in.2-sec, and wall temperatures up to 1180 F. Preliminary results, using measured wall temperature as an indirect indicator of the carbon deposition process, show that in copper test pieces above approximately 850 F, RP-2 begins to undergo thermal decomposition resulting in local carbon deposits. Wall temperature traces show significant local temperature increases followed by near instantaneous drops which have been attributed to the carbon deposition/shedding process in previous investigations. Data reduction is currently underway for the stainless steel test sections and carbon deposition measurements will be performed in the future for all test sections used in this investigation. In conjunction with the existing thermal stability database, these findings give insight into the feasibility of cooling a long life, high performance, high-pressure liquid rocket combustor and nozzle with RP-2.\n\nRP process studies with radioactive beams at ATLAS\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRehm, K E [Argonne National Lab., Physics Div., Argonne, IL (United States)\n\n1998-06-01\n\nReactions of interest to nuclear astrophysics have been studied with radioactive beams at the ATLAS accelerator.

The method consisted in changing the voltage and recording the corresponding counts. Then, the area of the best response was determined according to the detector characteristics, and also was found that for the RP-0, the response was in the proportional region, meanwhile for the RP-10, the response was in the region of ionization chambers. The values obtained were: BF3-A3 (RP-0) and 1150 V for RP-10, CF-A1 = 400 V, CF-A2 = 400 V, CF-A3 = 400 V.

RP 62719 is a novel pure class III antiarrhythmic agent known to prolong the cardiac action potential duration by selectively blocking the inward rectifying K+ current. Mechanical parameters were determined from contraction and relaxation phases under isotonic and isometric conditions. At a concentration of 0.02 microM, RP 62719 did not produce significant effects on inotropy or lusitropy. At 0.2 and 2 microM, the drug improved contraction under both heavy and low loading conditions, as evidenced by a 30% increase in maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax, P delta L, P force normalized per cross-sectional area (AF/s, P force derivative per mm2 (+dF/s, P force derivative per mm2 (-dF/s, P < .001). At a higher concentration (20 microM), effects of RP 62719 on inotropy and lusitropy were less marked, thus accounting for the bell-shaped form of the dose-response curve. An increase in the extracellular Ca++ concentration from 2.5 to 3.75 mM improved inotropy to a similar extent (+30-50%) as did 2 microM RP 62719. However, lusitropy and mechanical coupling between contraction and relaxation were not modified in the same proportion under RP 62719 and under 3.75 mM Ca++.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nBurst Pressure Prediction of Multiple Cracks in Pipelines\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRazak, N A; Alang, N A; Murad, M A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAvailable industrial code such as ASME B1G, modified ASME B1G and DNV RP-F101 to assess pipeline defects appear more conservative for multiple crack like- defects than single crack-like defects. Thus, this paper presents burst pressure prediction of pipe with multiple cracks like defects. A finite element model was developed and the burst pressure prediction was compared with the available code. The model was used to investigate the effect of the distance between the cracks and the crack length. The coalescence diagram was also developed to evaluate the burst pressure of the multiple cracks. It was found as the distance between crack increases, the interaction effect comes to fade away and multiple cracks behave like two independent single cracks\n\n12 CFR 411.105 - Definitions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-01-01\n\n... 12 Banks and Banking 4 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Definitions. 411.105 Section 411.105 Banks and Banking EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES NEW RESTRICTIONS ON LOBBYING General Â§ 411.105 Definitions.

This raises questions as to their respective functions. The acute activation of AgRP neurons robustly promotes food intake, while central injections of AgRP, NPY, or GABA agonist results in the marked escalation of food consumption with temporal variance. Given the orexigenic capability of all three of these neuroactive substances in conjunction with their coexpression in AgRP neurons, we looked to unravel their relative temporal role in driving food intake. After the acute stimulation of AgRP neurons with DREADD technology, we found that either GABA or NPY is required for the rapid stimulation of feeding, and the neuropeptide AgRP, through action on MC4 receptors, is sufficient to induce feeding over a delayed yet prolonged period. These studies help to elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms of AgRP neurons in controlling temporally distinct phases of eating. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Figures 1-1 and 1-2 identify the rooms that are the subject of this SAP. These rooms are to be decontaminated and demolished as an initial step (Phase 1 ) in the Interim Safe Storage process for these reactors. Section 1.0 presents the background and sites history for the reactor buildings and summarizes the data quality objective process, which provides the logical basis for this SAP. Preliminary surveys indicate that little radiochemical contamination is present. Section 2.0 presents the quality assurance project plan, which includes a project management structure, sampling methods and quality control, and oversight of the sampling process. Section 2.2.1 summarizes the sampling methods, reflecting the radiological and chemical sampling designs presented in Tables 1-17 and 1-18. Section 3.0 presents the Field Sampling Plan for Phase 1. The sampling design is broken into two stages. Stage 1 will verify the list of radioactive constituents of concern and generate the isotopic distribution. The objectives of Stage 2 are to estimate the radionuclide inventories of room debris, quantify chemical contamination, and survey room contents for potential salvage or recycle. Table 3-1 presents the sampling activities to be performed in Stage 1. Tables 1-17 and 1-18 identify samples to be collected in Stage 2. Stage 2 will consist primarily of survey data collection, with fixed laboratory samples to be collected in areas showing visible stains.

The presented research aimed to investigate the effects of a reduction of 25% in the dietary crude protein (CP) level in the F0 generation on the body composition and reproductive performance of F1 broiler breeders. In the F0 generation, breeders were fed either a control (C) or reduced balanced protein (RP) diet, 25% reduction in crude protein and amino acids. Female F0-progeny of each treatment were fed a C or RP diet, resulting in 4 treatments in the F1 breeder generation: C/C, C/RP, RP/C, and RP/RP. The reproductive performance of breeders fed RP diets was negatively influenced by the dietary CP reduction in the F1 generation (PÂ diets in the F0 generation showed a significantly reduced reproductive capacity compared to their control fed counterparts (PÂ diets in the F1 generation were characterized by higher plasma T3 concentrations (PÂ diets in the F0 generation needed lower feed allocations in the laying phase to maintain a similar body weight. Egg weight was reduced for the C/RP and RP/RP breeders. At 34 wk of age, eggs from C/RP and RP/RP breeders showed a reduced proportional albumen weight, whereas no effects on egg composition were found at 42 wk of age. It was concluded that prenatal protein undernutrition triggered hens to relocate more energy towards growth and maintenance and less towards reproductive capacity.\n\nSimplified RP-HPLC method for multi-residue analysis of abamectin, emamectin benzoate and ivermectin in rice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXie, Xianchuan; Gong, Shu; Wang, Xiaorong; Wu, Yinxing; Zhao, Li\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA rapid, reliable and sensitive reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection (RP-FLD-HPLC) was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of the abamectin (ABA), emamectin (EMA) benzoate and ivermectin (IVM) residues in rice. After extraction with acetonitrile/water (2 : 1) with sonication, the avermectin (AVMs) residues were directly derivatised by N-methylimidazole (N-NMIM) and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) and then analysed on RP-FLD-HPLC. A good linear relationship (r(2 )> 0.99) was obtained for three AVMs ranging from 0.01 to 5 microg ml(-1), i.e. 0.01-5.0 microg g(-1) in rice matrix. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were between 0.001 and 0.002 microg g(-1) and between 0.004 and 0.006 microg g(-1), respectively. Recoveries were from 81.9% to 105.4% and precision less than 12.4%. The proposed method was successfully applied to routine analysis of the AVMs residues in rice.\n\nAutosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa with RP1 mutations is associated with myopia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChassine, Thomas; Bocquet, BÃ©atrice; Daien, Vincent; Avila-Fernandez, Almudena; Ayuso, Carmen; Collin, Rob Wj; Corton, Marta; Hejtmancik, J Fielding; van den Born, L Ingeborgh; Klevering, B Jeroen; Riazuddin, S Amer; Sendon, Nathacha; Lacroux, Annie; Meunier, Isabelle; Hamel, Christian P\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTo determine the refractive error in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) caused by RP1 mutations and to compare it with that of other genetic subtypes of RP. Twenty-six individuals had arRP with RP1 mutations, 25 had autosomal dominant RP (adRP) with RP1 mutation, 8 and 33 had X-linked RP (xlRP) with RP2 and RPGR mutations, respectively, 198 and 93 had Usher syndrome and arRP without RP1 mutations, respectively. The median of the spherical equivalent (SE) and the IQR (Q25-Q75) was determined and multiple comparisons were performed. arRP patients with RP1 mutations had SE median at -4.0 dioptres (D) OD (Ocula Dextra); -3.88â D OS (Ocula Sinistra), whereas arRP patients without RP1 mutations (-0.50â D OD; -0.75â D OS) and Usher syndrome patients (-0.50â D OD; -0.38â D OS) were significantly less myopic (pUsher syndrome and adRP with RP1 mutation had a narrow IQR (-9.06 to -1.13 D), whereas arRP with RP1 mutations and xlRP with RP2 or RPGR mutations had a larger range (-9.06; -1.13â D). arRP patients with RP1 mutations have myopia not different from patients with xlRP with RP2 or RPGR mutations, while RP patients from other genetic subgroups were emmetropic or mildly myopic. We suggest that arRP patients with high myopic refractive error should be preferentially analysed for RP1 mutations. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

D.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe objective of this research is to obtain the values of chemical composition, electrochemical potential and electrochemical efficiency. Methods used were experiment with physical tests conducted in metallurgical laboratory and DNV-RP-B401 cathode protection design DNV (Det Norske Veritas) standard. The results showed that the composition of chemical as Zinc (Zn), Aluminium, Cadmium, Plumbumb, Copper and Indium is suitable of standard. The values of electrochemical potential and electrochemical efficiency were respectively. However it can be concluded that the normal meaning of recycled zinc anode with increasing melting temperature can produce zinc anode better than original zinc anode and can be used as cathode protection on board ships. This research can assist in the management of used zinc anode waste, the supply of zinc anodes for consumers at relatively low prices, and recommendations of using zinc anodes for the prevention of corrosion on board ship.\n\nSynthesis of RP 48497, an Impurity of Eszopiclone\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMao-Sheng Cheng\n\n2008-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract: RP 48497 is a photodegradation product of eszopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic used in the treatment of insomnia. We report herein the first synthesis of RP 48497 via reduction, chlorination, and recyclization of 6-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-5-one (3, a key intermediate in the synthesis of eszopiclone. The structure of RP 48497 was confirmed by its 1H-NMR and MS data. The mechanism of the reduction step in the synthesis of RP 48497 was also studied and the key parameters were determined. These findings should be important for quality control purposes in the manufacture of eszopiclone.\n\nDevelopment and validation of RP-UHPLC procedure for estimation of 5-amino salicyclic acid in 5-amino salicyclic acid rectal suppositories\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBalaji, Jayagopal; Shivashankar, Murugesh\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe present study describes a simple and robust reverse phase ultra performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the quantification of 5-amino salicyclic acid in 5-amino salicyclic acid rectal capsules. Successful separation of Mesalamine peak from excipient peaks and diluent were achieved on a Acquity C8 (50 Ã 2.1 mm, 1.7 Î¼m) and UV detector at 254 nm, 0.3 mL/min as a flow rate, and 3 Î¼L as an injection volume. For the RP-UPLC method, phosphate buffer and methanol was used as mobile phases at ratio of 83:17 and the column temperature was 25 Â°C. Percentage recovery obtained in the range of 98.7 - 99.7 % and the method is linear for Mesalamine for specified concentration range with coefficient of variation (r) not less than 0.99. The proposed RP-UPLC method was found to be specific, linear, precise, accurate and robust.\n\nSimplification and transformation of ASTM F1292 measurement procedure for fall accident injury criteria.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKato, Maki; Shimodaira, Yoshie; Sato, Takeshi; Iida, Hiromi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nProtecting children from injuries caused by fall accidents from playground equipment is important. Therefore, measures toward minimizing the risk of fall accident injuries are required. The risk of injury can be evaluated using ASTM F1292. In this test, G-max and the HIC are used to estimate the risk of injury. However, the measurement procedure is too complicated for application to a large number of installed equipment. F1292 requires simplified by reducing the number of phases, even with a small risk of loss in accuracy. With this in mind, this study proposes a shortened measurement procedure and a transformation equation to estimate the risk as same as F1292. As the result of experiments, it was revealed that G-max and the HIC values for both procedures linearly increase with drop height. The differences in outcomes between the regression equations of the standardized procedure and those of the shortened procedure can be used as a correction value. They can be added to the value measured by the shortened procedure. This suggests that the combination of the shortened procedure and transformation equation would be equivalent to F1292, with the advantage of being more easily and efficiently applied to the evaluation of installed playground equipment.\n\n46 CFR 105.35-15 - Fire hose.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... bronze or equivalent metal.

Zootechnical performance of the F1 broiler offspring.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLesuisse, J; Schallier, S; Li, C; Bautil, A; Li, B; Leblois, J; Buyse, J; Everaert, N\n\n2018-05-01\n\nSeveral studies in mammals focused on the maternal programming of the metabolism by epigenetic mechanisms, while currently, the consequences of a maternal dietary treatment on the offspring performance of farm animals are of particular interest for commercial purpose. In the present study, we investigated if the zootechnical performance of the progeny was altered by a maternal dietary treatment, being a lower dietary crude protein (CP) of the grandparent and/or parent generation. The multigenerational effects of a reduced maternal CP content were investigated by reducing the dietary CP level by 25% in rearing and laying diets of pure line A breeders. The F0 generation breeders were fed either control (C) or reduced balanced protein (RP) diets. The F1 breeder generation was constructed by dividing the F0 female progeny again over a C or RP diet, resulting in 4 dietary treatments in the F1 generation: C/C, C/RP, RP/C, and RP/RP (letters indicating the diets in, respectively, F0 and F1 generations). The offspring performance was evaluated by a zootechnical and nitrogen retention trial on C and low-protein (LP) broiler diets. For the C broiler diet, the C/RP and RP/RP offspring were characterized by a higher BW from d 35 until d 42 compared to the C/C progeny, whereas the RP/C offspring had an intermediate BW that did not differ from the other groups. A tendency (P = 0.067) towards a better nitrogen retention was observed for the offspring of breeders that received the RP diets in F0 and/or F1 generation compared to the C/C progeny. For the LP broiler diet, the C/RP (P = 0.021) and RP/C (P = 0.001) offspring had a higher BW compared to the C/C progeny during the entire grow-out period. In addition, the C/RP offspring were characterized by a lower FCR from d 28 onwards (P = 0.021). In conclusion, dietary treatments imposed on mother hens can have direct effects on the next generation, as well as indirect effects on multiple generations.\n\n5 CFR 2610.105 - Eligibility of applicants.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-01-01\n\n... 5 Administrative Personnel 3 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Eligibility of applicants. 2610.105 Section 2610.105 Administrative Personnel OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES... cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a...\n\nLarval development of Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda fed on fresh ear of field corn expressing the Bt proteins (Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOrcial Ceolin Bortolotto\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to evaluate extent of larval period, larval survival (%, food consumption, and pupal biomass of Spodoptera eridania and Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae fed on fresh ears of field corn expressing Bt proteins (Cry1F and Cry1F+Cry1A.105+Cry2Ab2. Larvae of Spodoptera spp. survived less than two days when they consumed Bt corncobs and showed 100% mortality. Spodoptera eridania reared on non-Bt corn cobs showed higher larval development (21.6 days than S. frugiperda (18.4 days and lower viability (56.4% and 80.2% for S. eridania and S. frugiperda , respectively. A higher amount of corn grains was consumed by S. eridania (5.4g than by S. frugiperda (3.9g. In summary, this study demonstrated that the toxins Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 expressed in fresh corn cobs contributed to protect ears of corn against S. frugiperda and the non-target pest S. eridania . However, itis important to monitor non-Bt cornfields because of the potential of both species to cause damage to ear sof corn.\n\nLarval development of Spodoptera eridania (Cramer fed on leaves of Bt maize expressing Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 proteins and its non-Bt isoline\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOrcial Ceolin Bortolotto\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aimed to evaluate, in controlled laboratory conditions (temperature of 25Â±2 Â°C, relative humidity of 60Â±10%, and 14/10 h L/D photoperiod, the larval development of Spodoptera eridania (Cramer, 1784 (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae fed with leaves of Bt maize expressing Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 insecticide proteins and its non-Bt isoline. Maize leaves triggered 100% of mortality on S. eridania larvae independently of being Bt or non-Bt plants. However, it was observed that in overall Bt maize (expressing a single or pyramided protein slightly affects the larval development of S. eridania, even under reduced leaf consumption. Therefore, these results showed that Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 can affect the larval development of S. eridania, although it is not a target pest of this plant; however, more research is needed to better understand this evidence. Finally, this study confirms that non-Bt maize leaves are unsuitable food source to S. eridania larvae, suggesting that they are not a potential pest in maize fields.\n\nArcuate AgRP neurons mediate orexigenic and glucoregulatory actions of ghrelinâ\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Qian; Liu, Chen; Uchida, Aki; Chuang, Jen-Chieh; Walker, Angela; Liu, Tiemin; Osborne-Lawrence, Sherri; Mason, Brittany L.; Mosher, Christina; Berglund, Eric D.; Elmquist, Joel K.; Zigman, Jeffrey M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe hormone ghrelin stimulates eating and helps maintain blood glucose upon caloric restriction. While previous studies have demonstrated that hypothalamic arcuate AgRP neurons are targets of ghrelin, the overall relevance of ghrelin signaling within intact AgRP neurons is unclear. Here, we tested the functional significance of ghrelin action on AgRP neurons using a new, tamoxifen-inducible AgRP-CreERT2 transgenic mouse model that allows spatiotemporally-controlled re-expression of physiological levels of ghrelin receptors (GHSRs) specifically in AgRP neurons of adult GHSR-null mice that otherwise lack GHSR expression. AgRP neuron-selective GHSR re-expression partially restored the orexigenic response to administered ghrelin and fully restored the lowered blood glucose levels observed upon caloric restriction. The normalizing glucoregulatory effect of AgRP neuron-selective GHSR expression was linked to glucagon rises and hepatic gluconeogenesis induction. Thus, our data indicate that GHSR-containing AgRP neurons are not solely responsible for ghrelin's orexigenic effects but are sufficient to mediate ghrelin's effects on glycemia.

While selected Russian engines use variations of swirl coaxial injectors, component level performance data has not been readily available, and all previously documented component testing at MSFC with LOX/RP ]1 had been performed using a variety of impinging injector designs. Impinging injectors have been adequate for specific LOX/RP ]1 engine applications, yet swirl coaxial injectors offer easier fabrication efforts, providing cost and schedule savings for hardware development. Swirl coaxial elements also offer more flexibility for design changes. Furthermore, testing with LOX and liquid methane propellants at MSFC showed that a swirl coaxial injector offered improved performance compared to an impinging injector. So, technical interest was generated to see if similar performance gains could be achieved with LOX/RP ]1 using a swirl coaxial injector. Results would allow such injectors to be considered for future engine concepts that require LOX/RP ]1 propellants. Existing injector and chamber hardware was used in the test assemblies. The injector had been tested in previous programs at MSFC using LOX/methane and LOX/hydrogen propellants. Minor modifications were made to the injector to accommodate the required LOX/RP ]1 flows. Mainstage tests were performed over a range of chamber pressures and mixture ratios. Additional testing included detonated gbombs h for stability data. Test results suggested characteristic velocity, C*, efficiencies for the injector were 95 ]97%. The injector also appeared dynamically stable with quick recovery from the pressure perturbations generated in the bomb tests.\n\nArcuate AgRP neurons mediate orexigenic and glucoregulatory actions of ghrelin\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nWang, Qian; Liu, Chen; Uchida, Aki; Chuang, Jen-Chieh; Walker, Angela; Liu, Tiemin; Osborne-Lawrence, Sherri; Mason, Brittany L.; Mosher, Christina; Berglund, Eric D.; Elmquist, Joel K.; Zigman, Jeffrey M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe hormone ghrelin stimulates eating and helps maintain blood glucose upon caloric restriction.

The goal of this study was to assess the role of CD105 expression during MI-induced angiogenesis by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using (64)Cu-labeled TRC105, an anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody. MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery in female rats. Echocardiography and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET scans were performed on post-operative day 3 to confirm the presence of MI in the infarct group and intact heart in the sham group, respectively. Ischemia-induced angiogenesis was non-invasively monitored with (64)Cu-NOTA-TRC105 (an extensively validated PET tracer in our previous studies) PET on post-operative days 3, 10, and 17. Tracer uptake in the infarct zone was highest on day 3 following MI, which was significantly higher than that in the sham group (1.41 Â± 0.45 %ID/g vs 0.57 Â± 0.07 %ID/g; n=3, p<0.05). Subsequently, tracer uptake in the infarct zone decreased over time to the background level on day 17, whereas tracer uptake in the heart of sham rats remained low at all time points examined. Histopathology documented increased CD105 expression following MI, which corroborated in vivo findings. This study indicated that PET imaging of CD105 can be a useful tool for MI-related research, which can potentially improve MI patient management in the future upon clinical translation of the optimized PET tracers.\n\nAt fÃ¥ en diagnose\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nOlesen, Birgitte Ravn; JansbÃ¸l, Kirsten\n\nI dette hÃ¦fte ligger fokus pÃ¥ dÃ¸vblindblevnes fortÃ¦llinger om at have et handicap uden at kende sin diagnose og om at hÃ¥ndtre at fÃ¥ diagnosen RP eller Usher syndrom.

Aim: To determine: 1) the safety and tolerance of the radiopharmaceutical in humans; 2) its pharmacokinetics and dosimetry; 3) its preliminary efficacy for the detection and localization of infectious foci. Materials and Methods: 20 subjects (14M, 6F) received 592 Â± 111 MBq (16 Â± 3 mCi) of RP-517 intravenously. All subjects were evaluated (medical history, physical exam, vital signs, ECG, blood and urine analysis) before and at several times up to 24 hours post-injection of RP-517. Blood samples were taken to determine pharmacokinetics and blood clearance. Urine and feces were collected to measure excretion. For dosimetry determination, whole body images, one transmission pre-injection and sequential emission images post-injection, were obtained with a dual head gamma camera (ADAC) in 2 patients and 14 volunteers. Sequential focal images were obtained in 4 patients. The presence of infection was determined by culture and/or follow-up. Results: There were no adverse clinical events or clinically significant changes in any of the laboratory analysis parameters, ECG or vital signs. RP-517 clears the blood mainly through the hepatobiliary system. The critical organ is the gall bladder wall, followed by the intestinal wall. A suggested maximum injected dose of about 740MBq of RP-517 would deliver â¤ 50 mGy to the critical organ. There were 6 patients with suspicion of infection: in 2 of them the infection was proven; a third subject had 2 suspected infectious foci, one was proven, the other one was equivocal; at the time of imaging, there was no infections process in the other 3 subjects. RP-517 images showed a clear and persistent uptake in the 3 proven infectious foci, was negative in the equivocal one and in the three patients without infection\n\n20 CFR 802.105 - Stay of payment pending appeal.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 20 Employees' Benefits 3 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Stay of payment pending appeal. 802.105...

During the customized surgical osteotmy guide (CSOG) design process, the correct position was identified and the geometry of the CSOG was generated based on affected mandible of the patient and fabricated by a RP technique. Surgical approach such as preoperative planning and simulation of surgical procedures was performed using advanced software. The VSP and RP assisted CSOG was used to avoid the damage of the adjacent teeth and neighboring healthy tissues. Finally the mock surgery was performed on the biomodel (i.e. diseased RP model) of mandible with reference to the normal maxilla using osteotomy bur with the help of CSOG. Using this CSOG the exact osteotomy of the mandible and the accurate placement of the distractor were obtained. It ultimately improved the accuracy of the surgery in context of the osteotomy and distraction. The time required in cutting the mandible and placement of the distractor was found comparatively less than the regular free hand surgery.\n\nQuantitative analysis of rutin, quercetin, naringenin, and gallic acid by validated RP- and NP-HPTLC methods for quality control of anti-HBV active extract of Guiera senegalensis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlam, Perwez; Parvez, Mohammad K; Arbab, Ahmed H; Al-Dosari, Mohammed S\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGuiera senegalensis J.F. Gmel (Combretaceae) is a folk medicinal plant used in various metabolic and infectious diseases. In addition to its antiviral activities against herpes and fowlpox, the anti-HBV efficacy is very recently reported. To develop and validate simple, sensitive RP-/NP-HPTLC methods for quantitative determination of biomarkers rutin, quercetin, naringenin, and gallic acid in the anti-HBV active G. senegalensis leaves ethanol-extract. RP-HPTLC (rutin & quercetin; phase- acetonitrile:water, 4:6) and NP-HPTLC (naringenin & gallic acid; phase- toluene:ethyl acetate:formic acid, 6:4:0.8) were performed on glass-backed silica gel plates 60F 254 -RP18 and 60F 254 , respectively. The methods were validated according to the ICH guidelines. Well-separated and compact spots (R f ) of rutin (0.52âÂ±â0.006), quercetin (0.23âÂ±â0.005), naringenin (0.56âÂ±â0.009) and gallic acid (0.28âÂ±â0.006) were detected. The regression equations (Y) were 12.434xâ+â443.49, 10.08xâ+â216.85, 11.253xâ+â973.52 and 11.082xâ+â446.41 whereas the coefficient correlations (r 2 ) were 0.997âÂ±â0.0004, 0.9982âÂ±â0.0001, 0.9974âÂ±â0.0004 and 0.9981âÂ±â0.0001, respectively. The linearity ranges (ng/spot) were 200-1400 (RP-HPTLC) and 100-1200 (NP-HPTLC). The LOD/LOQ (ng/band) were 33.03/100.1 (rutin), 9.67/29.31 (quercetin), 35.574/107.8 (naringenin), and 12.32/37.35 (gallic acid). Gallic acid (7.01âÎ¼g/mg) was the most abundant biomarker compared to rutin (2.42âÎ¼g/mg), quercetin (1.53âÎ¼g/mg) and naringenin (0.14âÎ¼g/mg) in the extract. The validated NP-/RP-HPTLC methods were simple, accurate, and sensitive for separating and quantifying antiviral biomarkers in G. senegalensis, and endorsed its anti-HBV activity. The developed methods could be further employed in the standardization and quality-control of herbal formulations.\n\nRadiation protection Group (SC/RP) desperately seeking...\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nA.
