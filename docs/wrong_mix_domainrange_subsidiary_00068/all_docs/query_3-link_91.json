M.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDirect Energy Transfer (DET) and MultiMission Spacecraft Modular Power System (MPS) computer programs perform mathematical modeling and simulation to aid in design and analysis of DET and MPS spacecraft power system performance in order to determine energy balance of subsystem. DET spacecraft power system feeds output of solar photovoltaic array and nickel cadmium batteries directly to spacecraft bus. MPS system, Standard Power Regulator Unit (SPRU) utilized to operate array at array's peak power point. DET and MPS perform minute-by-minute simulation of performance of power system. Results of simulation focus mainly on output of solar array and characteristics of batteries. Both packages limited in terms of orbital mechanics, they have sufficient capability to calculate data on eclipses and performance of arrays for circular or near-circular orbits. DET and MPS written in FORTRAN-77 with some VAX FORTRAN-type extensions. Both available in three versions: GSC-13374, for DEC VAX-series computers running VMS. GSC-13443, for UNIX-based computers.

This phenotype requires HY5, ABF1, ABF3, and ABF4. While DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1) is well known as a negative regulator of light development, here we describe how det1 mutants also exhibit altered responses to salt and osmotic stress, specifically salt and mannitol resistant germination. LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) positively regulates both light and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. We found that hy5 suppressed the det1 salt and mannitol resistant germination phenotype, thus, det1 stress resistant germination requires HY5. We then queried publically available microarray datasets to identify genes downstream of HY5 that were differentially expressed in det1 mutants. Our analysis revealed that ABA regulated genes, including ABA RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING FACTOR 3 (ABF3), are downregulated in det1 seedlings. We found that ABF3 is induced by salt in wildtype seeds, while homologues ABF4 and ABF1 are repressed, and all three genes are underexpressed in det1 seeds. We then investigated the role of ABF3, ABF4, and ABF1 in det1 phenotypes. Double mutant analysis showed that abf3, abf4, and abf1 all suppress the det1 salt/osmotic stress resistant germination phenotype. In addition, abf1 suppressed det1 rapid water loss and open stomata phenotypes. Thus interactions between ABF genes contribute to det1 salt/osmotic stress response phenotypes.\n\nManipulation of DET1 expression in tomato results in photomorphogenic phenotypes caused by post-transcriptional gene silencing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDavuluri, Ganga Rao; van Tuinen, Ageeth; Mustilli, Anna Chiara; Manfredonia, Alessandro; Newman, Robert; Burgess, Diane; Brummell, David A.; King, Stephen R.; Palys, Joe; Uhlig, John; Pennings, Henk M. J.; Bowler, Chris\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSummary The tomato HIGH PIGMENT-2 gene encodes an orthologue of the Arabidopsis nuclear protein DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1). From genetic analyses it has been proposed that DET1 is a negative regulator of light signal transduction, and recent results indicate that it may control light-regulated gene expression at the level of chromatin remodelling. To gain further understanding about the function of DET1 during plant development, we generated a range of overexpression constructs and introduced them into tomato. Unexpectedly, we only observed phenotypes characteristic of DET1 inactivation, i.e. hyper-responsiveness to light. Molecular analysis indicated in all cases that these phenotypes were a result of suppression of endogenous DET1 expression, due to post-transcriptional gene silencing. DET1 silencing was often lethal when it occurred at relatively early stages of plant development, whereas light hyper-responsive phenotypes were obtained when silencing occurred later on. The appearance of phenotypes correlated with the generation of siRNAs but not DNA hypermethylation, and was most efficient when using constructs with mutations in the DET1 coding sequence or with constructs containing only the 3â²-terminal portion of the gene. These results indicate an important function for DET1 throughout plant development and demonstrate that silencing of DET1 in fruits results in increased carotenoids, which may have biotechnological potential.

The ability of seeds to accurately respond to light is vital for plant survival. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we reveal a circuit of triple feed-forward loops adopted by Arabidopsis seeds to exclusively repress germination in dark conditions and precisely initiate germination under diverse light conditions. We identify that de-etiolated 1 (DET1), an evolutionarily conserved protein, is a central repressor of light-induced seed germination. Genetic analysis demonstrates that DET1 functions upstream of long hypocotyl in far-red 1 (HFR1) and phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1), the key positive and negative transcription regulators in seed germination. We further find that DET1 and constitutive photomorphogenic 10 (COP10) target HFR1 for protein degradation by assembling a COP10âDET1âdamaged DNA binding protein 1âcullin4 E3 ligase complex. Moreover, DET1 and COP10 directly interact with and promote the protein stability of PIF1. Computational modeling reveals that phytochrome B (phyB)âDET1âHFR1âPIF1 and phyBâDET1âProteaseâPIF1 are new signaling pathways, independent of the previously identified phyB-PIF1 pathway, respectively mediating the rapid and time-lapse responses to light irradiation. The model-simulated results are highly consistent with their experimental validations, suggesting that our mathematical model captures the essence of Arabidopsis seed germination networks. Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive molecular framework for light-regulated seed germination, improving our understanding of how plants respond to changeable environments.

Udh1 differs from those of known 5alpha-steroid reductases by six additional domains, partially predicted to be membrane-spanning. A fusion protein of Udh1 and the green fluorescent protein provided evidence for endoplasmic reticulum localization in U. maydis. The function of the Udh1 protein was demonstrated by complementing Arabidopsis det2-1 mutants, which display a dwarf phenotype due to a mutation in the 5alpha-steroid reductase encoding DET2 gene. det2-1 mutant plants expressing either the udh1 or the DET2 gene controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter differed from wild-type Columbia plants by accelerated stem growth, flower and seed development and a reduction in size and number of rosette leaves. The accelerated growth phenotype of udh1 transgenic plants was stably inherited and was favored under reduced light conditions. Truncation of the N-terminal 70 amino acids of the Udh1 protein abolished the ability to restore growth in det2-1 plants. Our results demonstrate the existence of a 5alpha-steroid reductase encoding gene in fungi and suggest a common ancestor between fungal, plant, and mammalian proteins.\n\nBiodegradation of diethyl terephthalate (DET) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by a novel identified degrader Delftia sp. WL-3 and its proposed metabolic pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Jiawei; Xu, Guanbao; Dong, Weiliang; Xu, Ning; Xin, Fengxue; Ma, Jiangfeng; Fang, Yan; Zhou, Jie; Jiang, Min\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET), a synthetic polyester material made of diethyl terephthalate (DET) monomers, is widely used in plastic products of daily life and caused serious pollution to the global environment. Microbial metabolism is the major degradation pathway responsible for DET degradation in natural soil; however, the microbial DET-degradation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the newly isolated strain WL-3, identified as belonging to the genus Delftia, was found to be able to degrade 94% of 5 gÂ·L -1 of DET and utilize it as the sole carbon source for growth within 7 days. Furthermore, strain WL-3 was capable of stable DET degradation under a wide range of pH values (6.0-9.0) and temperatures (20-42Â°C) with the optimal pH and temperature of 7.0 and 30Â°C respectively. Furthermore, the biochemical pathway of DET degradation by strain WL-3 was proposed based on the identified degradation intermediates. DET is first transformed into terephthalic acid (TPA) by the hydrolysis of two ester bonds, which is subsequently converted to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and further mineralized. SEM observations revealed obvious cracks on the surface of PET film after inoculation of 2 months with strain WL-3, indicating the strain's potential for the bioremediation of PET-contaminated environments.

After retrieval, each piece of hydrogel, corresponding to 25 Î¼L, was introduced into 1 mL of colorimetric reagent (CR) solution consisting of formic acid and bromophenol blue. After the elution/reaction time, absorbance of the latter mixture was read at 590 nm and compared to a calibration curve obtained with the same protocol applied to mini DET probes soaked in sodium hydrogen carbonate standard solutions. This method allows rapid alkalinity determinations for the small volumes of anoxic pore water entrapped into the gel. The method was assessed on organic-rich coastal marine sediments from Thau lagoon (France). Alkalinity values in the overlying waters were in agreement with data obtained by classical sampling techniques. Pore water data showed a progressive increase of alkalinity in the sediment from 2 to 10 mmol kg(-1), corresponding to anaerobic respiration in organic-rich sediments. Moreover, replicates of high-resolution DET profiles showed important lateral heterogeneity at a decimeter scale. This underlines the importance of high-resolution spatial methods for alkalinity profiling in coastal marine systems. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the modules found in the resistance determinant (r-det), or Tn2670, region of NR1 (also known as R100), isolated from a Shigella flexneri strain in Japan in the late 1950s, were present in pRMH760 but in a different configuration. The location was also different, with the Tn2670-derived region flanked by the transposition module of Tn1696 and a mercury resistance module almost identical to one found in the plasmid pDU1358. This arrangement is consistent with a three-step process. First, the r-det was circularized via homologous recombination between the IS1 elements and reincorporated at a new location, possibly in a different plasmid, via homologous recombination between the 5'-conserved (5'-CS) or 3'-CS of the In34 integron in the r-det and the same region of a second class 1 integron in a Tn1696 relative. Subsequently, resolvase-mediated recombination between the res sites in the r-det and a second mercury resistance transposon removed one end of the Tn1696-like transposon and part of the second transposon. Other events occurring within the r-det-derived portion have also contributed to the formation of the pRMH760 resistance region. Tn2 or a close relative that includes the bla(TEM-1b) gene had moved into the Tn21 mercury resistance module with subsequent deletion of the adjacent sequence, and all four 38-bp inverted repeats corresponding to Tn21 family transposon termini have been interrupted by an IS4321-like element.\n\nSubchronic Oral Toxicity of the Insect Repellent N,N-Diethyl-m-Toluamide (m-DET), September 1978 - May 1979.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-02-08\n\n4 O.

While protein structure is mainly used as a method of attaching the protein to the electrode surface, we employed bioinformatics analysis to predict the suitable orientation of the enzymes to promote DET. Structure similarity and secondary structure prediction were combined underlying localized amino-acids able to direct one of the enzyme's electron relays toward the electrode surface by creating a suitable bioelectrocatalytic nanostructure. The electro-polymerization of pyrene pyrrole onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode allowed the targeted orientation of the formate dehydrogenase enzyme from Rhodobacter capsulatus (RcFDH) by means of hydrophobic interactions. Its electron relays were directed to the FTO surface, thus promoting DET. The reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) generating a maximum current density of 1Î¼Acm(-2) with 10mM NAD(+) leads to a turnover number of 0.09electron/s/molRcFDH. This work represents a practical approach to evaluate electrode surface modification strategies in order to create valuable bioelectrocatalysts. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DetOx is a program for partitioning overlapping X-ray absorption spectra into contributions from individual atomic species and computing the dependence of the anomalous scattering factors on X-ray energy. It is demonstrated how these results can be used in combination with X-ray diffraction data to determine the oxidation state of ions at specific sites in a mixed-valance material, GaCl(2).\n\nPhyloDet: a scalable visualization tool for mapping multiple traits to large evolutionary trees\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Bongshin; Nachmanson, Lev; Robertson, George; Carlson, Jonathan M.; Heckerman, David\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSummary: Evolutionary biologists are often interested in finding correlations among biological traits across a number of species, as such correlations may lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying function. Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates species. In this note, we introduce PhyloDet (short for PhyloDetective), an evolutionary tree visualization tool that enables biologists to visualize multiple traits mapped to the tree.

For instance, the Space Situational Awareness programme (SSA) at ESA has set up in 2013 a centre and network for aspects connected to space debris (SST), to space weather (SW), and to near-Earth objects (NEO). At IMCCE, the PÃ´le sur la dynamique de l'environnement terrestre} (PODET, \\\\url{podet.imcce.fr}) for the Earth dynamical environment is studying effects and prediction for natural and artificial objects gravitating in the Earth vicinity. These studies englobe near-Earth objects, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, meteorite streams, and space debris. For all object types that are concerned, a general scheme of a functional analysis has been developed. It encompasses data acquisition with dedicated observations--essentially astrometric--or database queries, orbit determination or adjustment, prediction and ephemerides, and eventually impact probability computation and data dissemination. We develop here the general context of this action, the PÃ´DET project, its scientific objectives, interaction with other disciplines, and the development in progress for dedicated tools.\n\nFluDetWeb: an interactive web-based system for the early detection of the onset of influenza epidemics.\n\nPubMed\n\nConesa, David; LÃ³pez-QuÃ­lez, Antonio; MartÃ­nez-Beneito, Miguel Angel; Miralles, MarÃ­a Teresa; Verdejo, Francisco\n\n2009-07-29\n\nThe early identification of influenza outbreaks has became a priority in public health practice. A large variety of statistical algorithms for the automated monitoring of influenza surveillance have been proposed, but most of them require not only a lot of computational effort but also operation of sometimes not-so-friendly software. In this paper, we introduce FluDetWeb, an implementation of a prospective influenza surveillance methodology based on a client-server architecture with a thin (web-based) client application design. Users can introduce and edit their own data consisting of a series of weekly influenza incidence rates. The system returns the probability of being in an epidemic phase (via e-mail if desired). When the probability is greater than 0.5, it also returns the probability of an increase in the incidence rate during the following week. The system also provides two complementary graphs. This system has been implemented using statistical free-software (R and WinBUGS), a web server environment for Java code (Tomcat) and a software module created by us (Rdp) responsible for managing internal tasks; the software package MySQL has been used to construct the database management system.

The monitoring of space object populations requires reliable acquisition of observational data, to support the development and validation of space debris environment models, the build-up and maintenance of a catalogue of orbital elements. In addition, data is needed for the assessment of conjunction events and for the support of contingency situations or launches. The currently available, mature image processing algorithms for detection and astrometric reduction of optical data cover objects that cross the sensor field-of-view comparably slowly, and within a rather narrow, predefined range of angular velocities. By applying specific tracking techniques, the objects appear point-like or as short trails in the exposures. However, the general survey scenario is always a âtrack before detectâ problem, resulting in streaks, i.e., object trails of arbitrary lengths, in the images. The scope of the ESA-funded StreakDet (Streak detection and astrometric reduction) project is to investigate solutions for detecting and reducing streaks from optical images, particularly in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) domain, where algorithms are not readily available yet. For long streaks, the challenge is to extract precise position information and related registered epochs with sufficient precision. Although some considerations for low-SNR processing of streak-like features are available in the current image processing and computer vision literature, there is a need to discuss and compare these approaches for space debris analysis, in order to develop and evaluate prototype implementations. In the StreakDet project, we develop algorithms applicable to single images (as compared to consecutive frames of the same field) obtained with any observing scenario, including space-based surveys and both low- and high-altitude populations. The proposed processing pipeline starts from the\n\nFluDetWeb: an interactive web-based system for the early detection of the onset of influenza epidemics\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground The early identification of influenza outbreaks has became a priority in public health practice. A large variety of statistical algorithms for the automated monitoring of influenza surveillance have been proposed, but most of them require not only a lot of computational effort but also operation of sometimes not-so-friendly software. Results In this paper, we introduce FluDetWeb, an implementation of a prospective influenza surveillance methodology based on a client-server architecture with a thin (web-based) client application design. Users can introduce and edit their own data consisting of a series of weekly influenza incidence rates. The system returns the probability of being in an epidemic phase (via e-mail if desired). When the probability is greater than 0.5, it also returns the probability of an increase in the incidence rate during the following week. The system also provides two complementary graphs. This system has been implemented using statistical free-software (â and WinBUGS), a web server environment for Java code (Tomcat) and a software module created by us (Rdp) responsible for managing internal tasks; the software package MySQL has been used to construct the database management system. The implementation is available on-line from: http://www.geeitema.org/meviepi/fludetweb/. Conclusion The ease of use of FluDetWeb and its on-line availability can make it a valuable tool for public health practitioners who want to obtain information about the probability that their system is in an epidemic phase. Moreover, the architecture described can also be useful for developers of systems based on computationally intensive methods.

Under some conditions, trace metal concentrations were higher in the hydrogels or filter membranes compared to bulk solution (enrichment). In synthetic soft water, enrichment of cationic trace metals in polyacrylamide hydrogels decreased with increasing trace metal concentration. Enrichment was little affected by Ca and Mg in the concentration range typically encountered in natural freshwaters, indicating high affinity but low capacity binding of trace metals to solid structure in polyacrylamide gels. The apparent binding strength decreased in the sequence: Cu > Pb > Ni approximately to Cd approximately to Co and a low concentration of cationic Cu eliminated enrichment of weakly binding trace metal cations. The polyacrylamide gels also had an affinity for fulvic acid and/or its trace metal complexes. Enrichment of cationic Cd in agarose gel and hydrophilic polyethersulfone filter was independent of concentration (10 nM to 5 microM) but decreased with increasing Ca/ Mg concentration and ionic strength, suggesting that it is mainly due to electrostatic interactions. However, Cu and Pb were enriched even after equilibration in seawater, indicating that these metals additionally bind to sites within the agarose gel and filter. Compared to the polyacrylamide gels, agarose gel had a lower affinity for metal-fulvic complexes. Potential biases in measurements made with the diffusive equilibration in thin-films (DET) technique, identified by this work, are discussed.\n\nDet Norske Veritas rule philosophy with regard to gas turbines for marine propulsion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMartin, P.\n\n1999-04-01\n\nThis paper is mainly based on Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Rules of January 1996, Part 4, Chapter 2, Section 4 -- Gas Turbines, and is intended to at least open the dialogue between the gas turbine industry and DNV. There is a need for design approval and manufacturing inspection process systematic and testing procedures to match the standards of the industry. The role and expectations imposed by owners, the authorities, insurance agencies, etc. needs to be understood. These expectations often have technical implications that may go against the normal procedures and practices of the gas turbine industry, and could havemoreÂ Â» cost impacts. The question of DNV acceptance criteria has been asked many times, with respect to gas turbines. DNV relies a great deal on the manufacturer to provide the basis for the design criteria, manufacturing, and testing criteria of the gas turbine. However, DNV adds its knowledge and experience to this, and checks that the documentation presented by the manufacturer is technically acceptable. Generally, a high level of the state-of-the-art theoretical documentation is required to support the design of modern gas turbines. A proper understanding of the rule philosophy of DNV could prove to be useful in developing better gas turbines systems, which fulfill the rule requirements, and at the same time save resources such as money and time. It is important for gas turbine manufacturers to understand the intent of the rules since it is the intent that needs to be fulfilled. Further, the rules do have the principle of equivalence, which means that there is full freedom in how one fulfills the intent of the rules, as long as DNV accepts the solution.Â«Â less\n\nThe De-Etiolated 1 Homolog of Arabidopsis Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZang, Guangchao; Zou, Hanyan; Zhang, Yuchan; Xiang, Zheng; Huang, Junli; Luo, Li; Wang, Chunping; Lei, Kairong; Li, Xianyong; Song, Deming; Din, Ahmad Ud; Wang, Guixue\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDEETIOLATED1 (DET1) plays a critical role in developmental and environmental responses in many plants. To date, the functions of OsDET1 in rice (Oryza sativa) have been largely unknown. OsDET1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DET1. Here, we found that OsDET1 is essential for maintaining normal rice development. The repression of OsDET1 had detrimental effects on plant development, and leaded to contradictory phenotypes related to abscisic acid (ABA) in OsDET1 interference (RNAi) plants. We found that OsDET1 is involved in modulating ABA signaling in rice. OsDET1 RNAi plants exhibited an ABA hypersensitivity phenotype. Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that OsDET1 interacts physically with DAMAGED-SPECIFIC DNA-BINDING PROTEIN1 (OsDDB1) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC10 (COP10); DET1- and DDB1-ASSOCIATED1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1. We found that the degradation of OsPYL5 was delayed in OsDET1 RNAi plants. These findings suggest that OsDET1 deficiency disturbs the COP10-DET1-DDB1 complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice. Additionally, OsDET1 also modulated ABA biosynthesis, as ABA biosynthesis was inhibited in OsDET1 RNAi plants and promoted in OsDET1-overexpressing transgenic plants. In conclusion, our data suggest that OsDET1 plays an important role in maintaining normal development in rice and mediates the cross talk between ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling pathways in rice.

ANIMALS 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES Horses received detomidine hydrochloride (20 Î¼g/kg, IV), followed 10 minutes later by MK-467 hydrochloride (150 Î¼g/kg; DET-MK), hyoscine butylbromide (0.2 mg/kg; DET-HYO), or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (DET-S), IV, in a Latin square design. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, arterial and venous blood pressures, and cardiac output were measured; blood gases and arterial plasma drug concentrations were analyzed; selected cardiopulmonary variables were calculated; and sedation and gastrointestinal borborygmi were scored at predetermined time points. Differences among treatments or within treatments over time were analyzed statistically. RESULTS With DET-MK, detomidine-induced hypertension and bradycardia were reversed shortly after MK-467 injection. Marked tachycardia and hypertension were observed with DET-HYO. Mean heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure differed significantly among all treatments from 15 to 35 and 15 to 40 minutes after detomidine injection, respectively. Cardiac output was greater with DET-MK and DET-HYO than with DET-S 15 minutes after detomidine injection, but left ventricular workload was significantly higher with DET-HYO. Borborygmus score, reduced with all treatments, was most rapidly restored with DET-MK. Sedation scores and pharmacokinetic parameters of detomidine did not differ between DET-S and DET-MK. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE MK-467 reversed or attenuated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects of detomidine without notable adverse effects or alterations in detomidine-induced sedation in horses. Further research is needed to determine whether these advantages are found in clinical patients and to assess whether the drug influences analgesic effects of detomidine.\n\nTherapeutically interchangeable? A study of real-world outcomes associated with switching basal insulin analogues among US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using electronic medical records data.\n\nPubMed\n\nLevin, P; Wei, W; Miao, R; Ye, F; Xie, L; Baser, O; Gill, J\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo evaluate real-world clinical outcomes for switching basal insulin analogues [insulin glargine (GLA) and insulin detemir (DET)] among US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Using the GE Centricity Electronic Medical Records database, this retrospective study examined two cohorts: cohort 1, comprising patients previously on GLA and then either switching to DET (DET-S) or continuing with GLA (GLA-C); and cohort 2, comprising patients previously on DET and then either switching to GLA (GLA-S) or continuing with DET (DET-C). Within each cohort, treatment groups were propensity-score-matched on baseline characteristics. At 1-year follow-up, insulin treatment patterns, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, hypoglycaemic events, weight and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. The analysis included 13â942 patients: cohort 1: nâ=â10â657 (DET-S, nâ=â1797 matched to GLA-C, nâ=â8860) and cohort 2: nâ=â3285 (GLA-S, nâ=â858 matched to DET-C, nâ=â2427). Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups in each cohort. At 1-year follow-up, in cohort 1, patients in the DET-S subgroup were significantly less persistent with treatment, more likely to use a rapid-acting insulin analogue, had higher HbA1c values, lower HbA1c reductions and lower proportions of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0 or <8.0% compared with patients in the GLA-C subgroup, while hypoglycaemia rates and BMI/weight values and change from baseline were similar in the two subgroups. In cohort 2, overall, there were contrasting findings between patients in the GLA-S and those in the DET-C subgroup. This study showed contrasting results when patients with T2DM switched between basal insulin analogues, although these preliminary results may be subject to limitations in the analysis. Nevertheless, this study calls into question the therapeutic interchangeability of GLA and DET, and this merits further investigation. Â© 2014 The Authors.

Since det[sub ren] for general fields is central to QED, it is desirable to have nonperturbative information on this determinant, even for the restricted magnetic fields considered here. To this end we continue our study of the physically relevant determinant det[sub Sch]. It is shown that the contribution of the massless Schwinger model to det[submoreÂ Â» Sch] is canceled by a contribution from the massive sector of QED in 1+1 dimensions and that zero modes are suppressed in det[sub Sch]. We then calculate det[sub Sch] analytically in the presence of a finite flux, cylindrical magnetic field. Its behavior for large flux and small fermion mass suggests that the zero-energy bound states of the two-dimensional Pauli Hamiltonian are the controlling factor in the growth of ln det[sub Sch]. Evidence is presented that det[sub Sch] does not converge to the determinant of the massless Schwinger model in the small mass limit for finite, nonzero flux magnetic fields.Â«Â less\n\nSingle versus double embryo transfer: cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nFiddelers, Audrey A A; van Montfoort, Aafke P A; Dirksen, Carmen D; Dumoulin, John C M; Land, Jolande A; Dunselman, Gerard A J; Janssen, J Marij; Severens, Johan L; Evers, Johannes L H\n\n2006-08-01\n\nTwin pregnancies after IVF are still frequent and are considered high-risk pregnancies leading to high costs. Transferring one embryo can reduce the twin pregnancy rate. We compared cost-effectiveness of one fresh cycle elective single embryo transfer (eSET) versus one fresh cycle double embryo transfer (DET) in an unselected patient population. Patients starting their first IVF cycle were randomized between eSET and DET. Societal costs per couple were determined empirically, from hormonal stimulation up to 42 weeks after embryo transfer. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, representing additional costs per successful pregnancy. Successful pregnancy rates were 20.8% for eSET and 39.6% for DET. Societal costs per couple were significantly lower after eSET (7334 euro) compared with DET (10,924 euro). The ICER of DET compared with eSET was 19,096 euro, meaning that each additional successful pregnancy in the DET group will cost 19,096 euro extra. One cycle eSET was less expensive, but also less effective compared to one cycle DET. It depends on the society's willingness to pay for one extra successful pregnancy, whether one cycle DET is preferred from a cost-effectiveness point of view.\n\nThe conflict between cell proliferation and expansion primarily affects stem organogenesis in Arabidopsis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaeda, Saori; Gunji, Shizuka; Hanai, Kenya; Hirano, Tomonari; Kazama, Yusuke; Ohbayashi, Iwai; Abe, Tomoko; Sawa, Shinichiro; Tsukaya, Hirokazu; Ferjani, Ali\n\n2014-11-01\n\nPlant shoot organs such as stems, leaves and flowers are derived from specialized groups of stem cells organized at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Organogenesis involves two major processes, namely cell proliferation and differentiation, whereby the former contributes to increasing the cell number and the latter involves substantial increases in cell volume through cell expansion. Co-ordination between the above processes in time and space is essential for proper organogenesis. To identify regulatory factors involved in proper organogenesis, heavy-ion beam-irradiated de-etiolated (det) 3-1 seeds have been used to identify striking phenotypes in the A#26-2; det3-1 mutant. In addition to the stunted plant stature mimicking det3-1, the A#26-2; det3-1 mutant exhibited stem thickening, increased floral organ number and a fruit shape reminiscent of clavata (clv) mutants. DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that A#26-2; det3-1 harbors a mutation in the CLV3 gene. Importantly, A#26-2; det3-1 displayed cracks that randomly occurred on the main stem with a frequency of approximately 50%. Furthermore, the double mutants clv3-8 det3-1, clv1-4 det3-1 and clv2-1 det3-1 consistently showed stem cracks with frequencies of approximately 97, 38 and 35%, respectively. Cross-sections of stems further revealed an increase in vascular bundle number, cell number and size in the pith of clv3-8 det3-1 compared with det3-1. These findings suggest that the stem inner volume increase due to clv mutations exerts an outward mechanical stress; that in a det3-1 background (defective in cell expansion) resulted in cracking of the outermost layer of epidermal cells.

In this study we evaluated, first, whether this cardiac abnormality is linked to structural or functional vascular abnormalities, and second, the effect of antihypertensive treatment by 12-month administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (50 mg twice a day orally). In essential hypertensives with dipypridamole echocardiography stress test (DET) (DET+, n = 8) and without (DET-, n = 8) ST segment depression greater than 0.1 mV during intravenous dipyridamole infusion (0.84 mg/kg over 10 min), we studied the forearm blood flow (FBF, venous plethysmography, mL/100) modifications induced by intrabrachial acetylcholine (Ach) (0.15, 0.45, 1.5, 4.5, 15 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1, 2, 4 micrograms/100 mL/min x 5 min each), a smooth muscle cell relaxant compound. Minimal forearm vascular resistances (MFVR), an index of arteriolar structural changes, were also calculated. Both Ach and SNP caused greater vasodilation in DET- as compared to DET+ while MFVRs were lower in DET- compared to DET+. After treatment, both DET+ and DET- patients showed a significant and similar reduction in blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, while vasodilation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was increased only in the DET+ group. In addition, forearm minimal vascular resistances were significantly reduced only in DET+ patients, who showed disappearance of dipyridamole-induced ischemic-like ST segment depression. In conclusion, these data confirm that essential hypertensive patients with microvascular coronary disease are characterized by the presence of structural changes in the forearm vascular bed.

Experimental randomized blinded crossover study. Six healthy horses. Detomidine (10 Î¼g kg(-1) IV) was administered alone (DET) and in combination with MK-467 (250 Î¼g kg(-1) IV; DET + MK). The level of sedation and intestinal sounds were scored. Heart rate (HR) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured. Blood was collected to determine plasma drug concentrations. Repeated measures anova was used for HR, CVP and intestinal sounds, and the Student's t-test for pairwise comparisons between treatments for the area under the time-sedation curve (AUCsed ) and pharmacokinetic parameters. Significance was set at p < 0.05. A significant reduction in HR was detected after DET, and HR was significantly higher after DET + MK than DET alone. No heart blocks were detected in any DET + MK treated horses. DET + MK attenuated the early increase in CVP detected after DET, but later the CVP decreased with both treatments. Detomidine-induced intestinal hypomotility was prevented by MK-467. AUCsed was significantly higher with DET than DET + MK, but maximal sedations scores did not differ significantly between treatments. MK-467 lowered the AUC of the plasma concentration of detomidine, and increased its volume of distribution and clearance. MK-467 prevented detomidine induced bradycardia and intestinal hypomotility. MK-467 did not affect the clinical quality of detomidine-induced sedation, but the duration of the effect was reduced, which may have been caused by the effects of MK-467 on the plasma concentration of detomidine. MK-467 may be useful clinically in the prevention of certain peripheral side effects of detomidine in horses. Â© 2013 The Authors.

W.; Zinder, Stephen H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA cDNA-microarray was designed and used to monitor the transcriptomic profile of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 (in a mixed community) respiring various chlorinated organics, including chloroethenes and 2,3-dichlorophenol. The cultures were continuously fed in order to establish steady-state respiration rates and substrate levels. The organization of array data into a clustered heat map revealed two major experimental partitions. This partitioning in the data set was further explored through principal component analysis. The first two principal components separated the experiments into those with slow (1.6 Â± 0.6 Î¼M Clâ/h)- and fast (22.9 Â± 9.6 Î¼M Clâ/h)-respiring cultures. Additionally, the transcripts with the highest loadings in these principal components were identified, suggesting that those transcripts were responsible for the partitioning of the experiments. By analyzing the transcriptomes (n = 53) across experiments, relationships among transcripts were identified, and hypotheses about the relationships between electron transport chain members were proposed. One hypothesis, that the hydrogenases Hup and Hym and the formate dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (DET0186-DET0187) form a complex (as displayed by their tight clustering in the heat map analysis), was explored using a nondenaturing protein separation technique combined with proteomic sequencing. Although these proteins did not migrate as a single complex, DET0112 (an FdhB-like protein encoded in the Hup operon) was found to comigrate with DET0187 rather than with the catalytic Hup subunit DET0110. On closer inspection of the genome annotations of all Dehalococcoides strains, the DET0185-to-DET0187 operon was found to lack a key subunit, an FdhB-like protein. Therefore, on the basis of the transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic evidence, the place of the missing subunit in the DET0185-to-DET0187 operon is likely filled by recruiting a subunit expressed from the Hup operon (DET0112).

Raman spectra characteristics of leaves and walls of cardiac implants were obtained; the implants were manufactured by protocols of detergent-enzymatic technique (DET) and biological, detergent-free (BIO) decellularization, using detergents (group DET) or a detergent-free, nonproteolytic, actin-disassembling regimen (BIO). There were input optical coefficients that allowed us to carry out evaluation of the protocols of DET and BIO decellularization on the basis of the concentrations of glycosaminoglycans, proteins, amides, and DNA. It was shown that during DET and BIO decellularization, composition aberrations of proteins and lipids do not occur and the integrity of the collagenous structures is preserved. It was found that during the DET decellularization, preservation of glycosaminoglycans is better than during BIO decellularization.\n\nMilitary Post Office Mail Distribution Scheme (MPOMDS)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1990-04-01\n\nVIENNA) 09667-0001 AMERICAN EMBASSY BELGIUM (BRUSSELS) 34032-0001 AMERICAN EMBASSY BOLIVIA (LA PAZ) 34030-0001 AMERICAN EMBASSY BRAZIL (BRASILA) 34033...1801 3 INF DIV, NCO ACADEMY 09036- 2018 3 INF, REPL DET 09701-1815 3 MATERIAL MAINT CMD 09182-1823 3 MED BN 09164-3443 3 MED DET 09164-3433 3 MED DET\n\nDevelopment of Biodegradable Polycation-Based Inhalable Dry Gene Powders by Spray Freeze Drying\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOkuda, Tomoyuki; Suzuki, Yumiko; Kobayashi, Yuko; Ishii, Takehiko; Uchida, Satoshi; Itaka, Keiji; Kataoka, Kazunori; Okamoto, Hirokazu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this study, two types of biodegradable polycation (PAsp(DET) homopolymer and PEG-PAsp(DET) copolymer) were applied as vectors for inhalable dry gene powders prepared by spray freeze drying (SFD). The prepared dry gene powders had spherical and porous structures with a 5~10-Î¼m diameter, and the integrity of plasmid DNA could be maintained during powder production. Furthermore, it was clarified that PEG-PAsp(DET)-based dry gene powder could more sufficiently maintain both the physicochemical properties and in vitro gene transfection efficiencies of polyplexes reconstituted after powder production than PAsp(DET)-based dry gene powder. From an in vitro inhalation study using an Andersen cascade impactor, it was demonstrated that the addition of l-leucine could markedly improve the inhalation performance of dry powders prepared by SFD. Following pulmonary delivery to mice, both PAsp(DET)- and PEG-PAsp(DET)-based dry gene powders could achieve higher gene transfection efficiencies in the lungs compared with a chitosan-based dry gene powder previously reported by us.

Fourteen elderly (70 Â± 4 years) apparently healthy males underwent the following tests: (i) incremental ramp test on cycle ergometer, (ii) one repetition maximum (1RM) leg press at 45Â°, (iii) a discontinuous exercise test on a cycle ergometer (DET-C) protocol and (iv) a resistance exercise leg press (DET-L) protocol. Heart rate, blood pressure and BL were obtained during each increment of exercise intensity. No significant differences (P>0Â·05) were found between methods of AT determination (BL and HRV) nor the relative intensity corresponding to AT (30% of maximum intensity) between the types of exercise (DET-C and DET-L). Furthermore, no significant differences (P>0Â·05) were found between the DET-C and DET-L in relation to HRV, however, the DET-L provided higher values of systolic blood pressure and BL (P<0Â·05) from the intensity corresponding to AT. We conclude that HRV was effective in determination of AT, and the parasympathetic modulation responses obtained during dynamic and resistive exercise protocols were similar when compared at the same relative intensity. However, DET-L resulted in higher values of blood pressure and BL at workloads beyond AT. Â© 2013 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Hypertension was present in all groups during anaesthesia with mean (+/- SD) systolic pressure of 30.7 +/- 5.0 kPa for the K/DET group, 27.7 +/- 2.7 kPa for the K/MID group, and 33.1 +/- 4.6 kPa for the Z/DET group. Heart rate was statistically significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the K/DET group (69 +/- 13.2 beats/min) compared to the K/MID group (97 +/- 22.6 beats/min), and ventilation rate was statistically significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the K/MID group (15 +/- 0.0 breaths/min) compared with the K/DET group (21 +/- 4.6). A metabolic acidosis and hypoxia were observed during anaesthesia when breathing air. Oxygen (O2) administration resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (hypercapnoea), arterial partial pressure of O2, and % oxyhaemoglobin saturation.\n\nThe electrochemical behavior of a FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase with direct electron transfer subunit by immobilization on self-assembled monolayers.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Inyoung; Loew, Noya; Tsugawa, Wakako; Lin, Chi-En; Probst, David; La Belle, Jeffrey T; Sode, Koji\n\n2018-06-01\n\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a vital technology for diabetes patients by providing tight glycemic control. Currently, many commercially available CGM sensors use glucose oxidase (GOD) as sensor element, but this enzyme is not able to transfer electrons directly to the electrode without oxygen or an electronic mediator. We previously reported a mutated FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase complex (FADGDH) capable of direct electron transfer (DET) via an electron transfer subunit without involving oxygen or a mediator. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical response of DET by controlling the immobilization of DET-FADGDH using 3 types of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with varying lengths. With the employment of DET-FADGDH and SAM, high current densities were achieved without being affected by interfering substances such as acetaminophen and ascorbic acid. Additionally, the current generated from DET-FADGDH electrodes decreased with increasing length of SAM, suggesting that the DET ability can be affected by the distance between the enzyme and the electrode. These results indicate the feasibility of controlling the immobilization state of the enzymes on the electrode surface. Copyright Â© 2017.

ADAPT can utilize any simulation tool which meets a minimal set of requirements. ADAPT is based on the concept of DET which uses explicit modeling of the deterministic dynamic processes that take place during a nuclear reactor plant system (or other complex system) evolution along with stochastic modeling. When DET are used to model various aspects of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), all accident progression scenarios starting from an initiating event are considered simultaneously. The DET branching occurs at user specifiedmoreÂ Â» times and/or when an action is required by the system and/or the operator. These outcomes then decide how the dynamic system variables will evolve in time for each DET branch. Since two different outcomes at a DET branching may lead to completely different paths for system evolution, the next branching for these paths may occur not only at separate times, but can be based on different branching criteria. The computational infrastructure allows for flexibility in ADAPT to link with different system simulation codes, parallel processing of the scenarios under consideration, on-line scenario management (initiation as well as termination), analysis of results, and user friendly graphical capabilities. The ADAPT system is designed for a distributed computing environment; the scheduler can track multiple concurrent branches simultaneously. The scheduler is modularized so that the DET branching strategy can be modified (e.g. biasing towards the worst-case scenario/event). Independent database systems store data from the simulation tasks and the DET structure so that the event tree can be constructed and analyzed later. ADAPT is provided with a user-friendly client which can easily sort through and display the results of an experiment, precluding the need for the user to manually inspect individual simulator runs.Â«Â less\n\nDeoxyelephantopin ameliorates lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced memory impairments in rats: Evidence for its anti-neuroinflammatory properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndy, Shathiswaran N; Pandy, Vijayapandi; Alias, Zazali; Kadir, Habsah Abdul\n\n2018-08-01\n\nNeuroinflammation is a critical pathogenic mechanism of most neurodegenerative disorders especially, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to induce neuroinflammation which is evident from significant upsurge of pro-inflammatory mediators in in vitro BV-2 microglial cells and in vivo animal models. In present study, we investigated anti-neuroinflammatory properties of deoxyelephantopin (DET) isolated from Elephantopus scaber in LPS-induced neuroinflammatory rat model. In this study, DET (0.625. 1.25 and 2.5â¯mg/kg, i.p.) was administered in rats for 21â¯days and those animals were challenged with single injection of LPS (250â¯Î¼g/kg, i.p.) for 7â¯days. Cognitive and behavioral assessment was carried out for 7â¯days followed by molecular assessment on brain hippocampus. Statistical significance was analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test to compare the treatment groups with the control group. DET ameliorated LPS-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing major pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and COX-2. Furthermore, DET enhanced the anti-inflammatory cytokines and concomitantly suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine production. DET treatment also reversed LPS-induced behavioral and memory deficits and attenuated LPS-induced elevation of the expression of AD markers. DET improved synaptic-functionality via enhancing the activity of pre- and post-synaptic markers, like PSD-95 and SYP. DET also prevented LPS-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration via inhibition of PARP-1, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3. Overall, our studies suggest DET can prevent neuroinflammation-associated memory impairment and neurodegeneration and it could be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of neuroinflammation-mediated and neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD.

These successes have been accompanied by an increase in multiple deliveries, and perinatal complications associated. The explanation for this complication is the transfer of more than one embryo, to increase the odds of delivery. Our objective was to compare the outcome of elective dual embryo transfer (eDET) to that of the transfer of more than two embryos without embryo cryopreservation (TET), terms of delivery rate and multiple delivery. We analyzed the data registered by 155 clinics members of the RLA: 11,024 eDET and 10,634 TET. The delivery rate was significantly higher when eDET was performed than when TET was performed (40.24% and 26.98%, p < 0.001). Also, the ratio of twin deliveries was higher in eDET (25.80% and 20.56%, p < 0.001). However, the ratio of triplets and more deliveries was higher in TET than in eDET (2.34%and 0.52%, p < 0.001). These findings were consistent across the different age categories of the female partner. Our findings suggest that eDET was associated with a statistically significant better delivery rate per embryo transfer, and lower ratio of triplet-and-higher deliveries, regardless of the woman's age. Therefore, there is no evidence that supports the transfer of more than two embryos.\n\nPerinatal outcomes among singletons after assisted reproductive technology with single-embryo or double-embryo transfer versus no assisted reproductive technology.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartin, Angela S; Chang, Jeani; Zhang, Yujia; Kawwass, Jennifer F; Boulet, Sheree L; McKane, Patricia; Bernson, Dana; Kissin, Dmitry M; Jamieson, Denise J\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo examine outcomes of singleton pregnancies conceived without assisted reproductive technology (non-ART) compared with singletons conceived with ART by elective single-embryo transfer (eSET), nonelective single-embryo transfer (non-eSET), and double-embryo transfer with the establishment of 1 (DET -1) or â¥2 (DET â¥2) early fetal heartbeats. Retrospective cohort using linked ART surveillance data and vital records from Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Connecticut. Not applicable. Singleton live-born infants. None. Preterm birth (PTB <37Â weeks), very preterm birth (VPTB <32Â weeks), small for gestational age birth weight (<10th percentile), low birth weight (LBW <2,500Â g), very low birth weight (VLBW <1,500Â g), 5-minute Apgar score <7, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. After controlling for maternal characteristics and employing a weighted propensity score approach, we found that singletons conceived after eSET were less likely to have a 5-minute Apgar <7 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.69) compared with non-ART singletons. There were no differences among outcomes between non-ART and non-eSET infants. We found that PTB, VPTB, LBW, and VLBW were more likely among DET -1 and DET â¥2 compared with non-ART infants, with the odds being higher for DET â¥2 (PTB aOR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.29; VPTB aOR 2.46; 95% CI, 1.20-5.04; LBW aOR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.24-3.79; VLBW aOR 3.67; 95% CI, 1.38-9.77). Compared with non-ART singletons, singletons born after eSET and non-eSET did not have increased risks whereas DET -1 and DET â¥2 singletons were more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes.

Microsimulation model. Three assisted reproduction centres in Scotland. A total of 6153 women undergoing treatment at one of three Scottish IVF clinics, between January 1997 and June 2007. A microsimulation model, populated using data inputs derived from a large clinical data set and published literature, was developed to compare the costs and consequences of using eSET or DET over multiple treatment cycles. Disability-free live births; twin pregnancy rate; women's quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); health service costs. Not only did DET produce a higher cumulative live birth rate compared with eSET for women of all three ages, but also a higher twin pregnancy rate. Compared with eSET, DET ranged from costing an additional Â£ 27,356 per extra live birth in women commencing treatment aged 32 years, to costing Â£ 15,539 per extra live birth in 39-year-old women. DET cost â¼ Â£ 28,300 and â¼ Â£ 20,300 per additional QALY in women commencing treatment aged 32 and 39 years, respectively. Considering the high twin pregnancy rate associated with DET, coupled with uncertainty surrounding QALY gains, eSET is likely to be the preferred option for most women aged â¤ 36 years. The cost-effectiveness of DET improves with age, and may be considered cost-effective in some groups of older women. The decision may best be considered on a case-by-case basis for women aged 37-39 years.

We compared the clinical outcome achieved in the years 1995-1999, in which eSET was rarely used (4.2% of women, DET period) with that of the years 2000-2004, in which eSET was more widely used (46.2%, eSET period). In the DET period, 826 women had 1359 fresh embryo cycles followed by 589 frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles. In the eSET period, 684 women had 1027 fresh and 683 FET cycles. The cumulative term live birth rate/woman was the primary clinical outcome measure. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a term live birth was also calculated based on hospital charges and medication prices of IVF/ICSI treatment. The cumulative pregnancy rate/oocytes pickup (38.2 versus 33.1%, P = 0.01), cumulative live birth rate/oocytes pickup (28.0 versus 22.5%, P = 0.002) and cumulative live birth rate/woman (41.7 versus 36.6%, P = 0.04) were all higher in the eSET period than in the DET period. The cumulative multiple birth rate was significantly lower in the eSET period than in the DET period (8.9 versus 19.6%, P < 0.0001). A term live birth in the eSET period was 19 889 euros less expensive than in the DET period. This study shows that eSET with cryopreservation is more effective and less expensive than DET and should be adopted as a treatment of choice.\n\nTransfer of more than two embryos, regardless of the age of the female partner, is not beneficial for neither the mothers nor the babies: lessons from the Latin American Registry of Assisted Reproductive Techniques\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchwarze, Juan Enrique; Crosby, Javier\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective ART has helped millions of infertile couples worldwide to overcome their childlessness.

In this study, the authors explored the application of DET in IMPT (IMPT-DET) and conducted robust optimization of IMPT-DET to see if the planning techniqueâs sensitivity to uncertainties was reduced. They also compared conventional and robust optimization of IMPT-DET with three-dimensional IMPT (IMPT-3D) to gain understanding about how plan robustness is achieved. Methods: They compared the robustness of IMPT-DET and IMPT-3D plans to uncertainties by analyzing plans created for a typical prostate cancer case and a base of skull (BOS) cancer case (using data for patients who had undergone proton therapy at our institution). Spots with the highest and second highest energy layers were chosen so that the Bragg peak would be at the distal edge of the targets in IMPT-DET using 36 equally spaced angle beams; in IMPT-3D, 3 beams with angles chosen by a beam angle optimization algorithm were planned. Dose contributions for a number of range and setup uncertainties were calculated, and a worst-case robust optimization was performed. A robust quantification technique was used to evaluate the plansâ sensitivity to uncertainties. Results: With no uncertainties considered, the DET is less robust to uncertainties than is the 3D method but offers better normal tissue protection. With robust optimization to account for range and setup uncertainties, robust optimization can improve the robustness of IMPT plans to uncertainties; however, our findings show the extent of improvement varies. Conclusions: IMPTâs sensitivity to uncertainties can be improved by using robust optimization. They found two possible mechanisms that made improvements possible: (1) a localized single-field uniform dose distribution (LSFUD) mechanism, in which the\n\nLocal and Systemic Inflammation May Mediate Diesel Engine Exhaust-Induced Lung Function Impairment in a Chinese Occupational Cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Haitao; Duan, Huawei; Meng, Tao; Yang, Mo; Cui, Lianhua; Bin, Ping; Dai, Yufei; Niu, Yong; Shen, Meili; Zhang, Liping; Zheng, Yuxin; Leng, Shuguang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDiesel exhaust (DE) as the major source of vehicle-emitted particle matter in ambient air impairs lung function. The objectives were to assess the contribution of local (eg, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] and serum Club cell secretory protein [CC16]) and systemic (eg, serum C-reaction protein [CRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) inflammation to DE-induced lung function impairment using a unique cohort of diesel engine testers (DETs, nâ=â137) and non-DETs (nâ=â127), made up of current and noncurrent smokers. Urinary metabolites, FeNO, serum markers, and spirometry were assessed. A 19% reduction in CC16 and a 94% increase in CRP were identified in DETs compared with non-DETs (all p values <10-4), which were further corroborated by showing a dose-response relationship with internal dose for DE exposure (all p values <.04) and a time-course relationship with DE exposure history (all p values <.005). Mediation analysis showed that 43% of the difference in FEV1 between DETs and non-DETs can be explained by circulating CC16 and CRP (permuted pâ<â.001). An inverse dose-dependent relationship between FeNO and internal dose for cigarette smoke was identified (pâ=â.0003). A range of 95% lower bounds of benchmark dose of 1.0261-1.4513âÎ¼g phenanthrols/g creatinine in urine as an internal dose was recommended for regulatory risk assessment.

A contrasting body of evidence indicates that insulin functions as an adiposity negative feedback signal and reduces food intake, weight gain and adiposity via action in the central nervous system. Basal insulin analogs, detemir (Det) and glargine (Glar), have been associated with less hypoglycemia compared with neutral protamine hagedorn insulin, and Det with less weight gain, especially in patients with higher body mass index (BMI). We sought to determine whether insulin therapy per se causes body weight and fat mass gain when delivered via a clinically relevant subcutaneous (SC) route in the absence of hypoglycemia and glycosuria in non-diabetic lean and diet-induced obese rats. Rats were exposed to either a low-fat diet (LFD; 13.5% fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat), and received Det (0.5âUâkg(-1)), Glar (0.2âUâkg(-1)) or vehicle (Veh) SC once daily for 4 weeks. These dosages of insulin were equipotent in rats with respect to blood-glucose concentration and did not induce hypoglycemia. As predicted by current models of energy homeostasis, neither insulin Det nor Glar therapy affected food intake and weight gain in LFD rats. Det treatment significantly attenuated food intake, body weight gain and fat mass gain relative to the Glar and Veh in high-fat fed animals, mirroring observations in humans. That neither insulin group gained excess weight, suggests weight gain with SC basal insulin therapy may not be inevitable. Our data further suggest that Det possesses a unique property to attenuate the development of obesity associated with a HFD.\n\nA Simple Method for Computing Resistance Distance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBapat, Ravindra B.; Gutmana, Ivan; Xiao, Wenjun\n\n2003-10-01\n\nThe resistance distance ri j between two vertices vi and vj of a (connected, molecular) graph G is equal to the effective resistance between the respective two points of an electrical network, constructed so as to correspond to G, such that the resistance of any edge is unity.

Previous studies of developmental regulation in leaves and flowers have revealed the crucial role of coordinated cell proliferation and differentiation during organogenesis. However, the importance of this coordination has not been examined in flowering stems. Very recently, we attempted to identify regulatory factors that maintain flowering stem integrity. We found that the increased cell number in clavata (clv) mutants and the decreased cell size in de-etiolated (det)3-1 resulted in flowering stems that were thicker and thinner, respectively, than in wild-type (WT) plants. Interestingly, in the cell proliferation- and cell expansion-defective double mutant clv det3-1, the flowering stems often exhibited severe cracking, resulting in exposure of their inner tissues. In this study, further quantification of the cellular phenotypes in the cotyledons and leaves revealed no differences between det3-1 and clv3 det3-1. Together, the above findings suggest that the clv3 mutation in a det3-1 background primarily affects flowering stems, while its effect on other organs is likely negligible. We propose that the coordination between cell proliferation and differentiation is not only important during leaf development, but also plays a role in the growth control of Arabidopsis flowering stems.\n\nMediatorless glucose biosensor and direct electron transfer type glucose/air biofuel cell enabled with carbon nanodots.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Mei; Gao, Yue; Sun, Junyong; Gao, Feng\n\n2015-03-03\n\nUtilization of carbon nanodots (CNDs), newcomers to the world of carbonaceous nanomaterials, in the electrochemistry realm has rarely been reported so far. In this study, CNDs were used as immobilization supports and electron carriers to promote direct electron transfer (DET) reactions of glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). At the CNDs electrode entrapped with GOx, a high rate constant (k(s)) of 6.28 Â± 0.05 s(-1) for fast DET and an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)(app)) as low as 0.85 Â± 0.03 mM for affinity to glucose were found. By taking advantage of its excellent direct bioelectrocatalytic performances to glucose oxidation, a DET-based biosensor for glucose detection ranging from 0 to 0.64 mM with a high sensitivity of 6.1 Î¼A mM(-1) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.07 Â± 0.03 Î¼M (S/N = 3) was proposed. Additionally, the promoted DET of BOD immobilized on CNDs was also observed and effectively catalyzed the reduction of oxygen to water at the onset potential of +0.51 V (vs Ag/AgCl). On the basis of the facilitated DET of these two enzymes at CNDs electrodes, a mediator-free DET-type glucose/air enzymatic biofuel cell (BFC), in which CNDs electrodes entrapped with GOx and BOD were employed for oxidizing glucose at the bioanode and reducing oxygen at the biocathode, respectively, was successfully fabricated. The constructed BFC displayed an open-circuit voltage (OCV) as high as 0.93 V and a maximum power density of 40.8 Î¼W cm(-2) at 0.41 V. These important features of CNDs have implied to be promising materials for immobilizing enzymes and efficient platforms for elaborating bioelectrochemical devices such as biosensors and BFCs.\n\nBasal Insulin Regimens for Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cost-Utility Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDawoud, Dalia; Fenu, Elisabetta; Higgins, Bernard; Wonderling, David; Amiel, Stephanie A\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo assess the cost-effectiveness of basal insulin regimens for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus in England. A cost-utility analysis was conducted in accordance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. The UK National Health Service and personal and social services perspective was used and a 3.5% discount rate was applied for both costs and outcomes. Relative effectiveness estimates were based on a systematic review of published trials and a Bayesian network meta-analysis. The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used, in which net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a threshold of Â£20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A wide range of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Insulin detemir (twice daily) [iDet (bid)] had the highest mean QALY gain (11.09 QALYs) and NMB (Â£181,456) per patient over the model time horizon. Compared with the lowest cost strategy (insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn once daily), it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Â£7844/QALY gained. Insulin glargine (od) [iGlarg (od)] and iDet (od) were ranked as second and third, with NMBs of Â£180,893 and Â£180,423, respectively. iDet (bid) remained the most cost-effective treatment in all the sensitivity analyses performed except when high doses were assumed (>30% increment compared with other regimens), where iGlarg (od) ranked first. iDet (bid) is the most cost-effective regimen, providing the highest QALY gain and NMB. iGlarg (od) and iDet (od) are possible options for those for whom the iDet (bid) regimen is not acceptable or does not achieve required glycemic control.

We compared seven IVF strategies concerning their cost-effectiveness using a Markov model. The model was based on a three IVF-attempts time horizon and a societal perspective using real world strategies and data, comparing seven IVF strategies, concerning costs, live births and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In order to increase pregnancy probability, one cycle of eSET + one cycle of standard treatment policy [STP, i.e. eSET in patients <38 years of age with at least one good quality embryo and double embryo transfer (DET) in the remainder of patients] + one cycle of DET have an ICER of 16,593 euro compared with three cycles of eSET. Furthermore, three STP cycles have an ICER of 17,636 euro compared with one cycle of eSET + one cycle of STP + one cycle of DET, and three DET cycles have an ICER of 26,729 euro compared with three cycles STP. Our study shows that in patients qualifying for IVF treatment, combining several transfer policies was not cost-effective. A choice has to be made between three cycles of eSET, STP or DET. It depends, however, on society's willingness to pay which strategy is to be preferred from a cost-effectiveness point of view.\n\nRandomized single versus double embryo transfer: obstetric and paediatric outcome and a cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKjellberg, Ann Thurin; Carlsson, Per; Bergh, Christina\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTransfer of several embryos after IVF results in a high multiple birth rate associated with increased morbidity and high costs for the neonatal care. In a previous randomized trial we demonstrated that a single embryo transfer (SET) strategy, including one fresh single embryo transfer and, if no live birth, one additional frozen-thawed SET, resulted in a live-birth rate that was not substantially lower than after double embryo transfer (DET) but markedly reduced the multiple birth rate. We compared costs for maternal health care and productivity losses and paediatric costs for the SET and DET strategies. In addition, maternal and paediatric outcomes between the two groups were compared. The SET strategy resulted in lower average total costs from treatment until 6 months after delivery. There were a few more deliveries with at least one live-born child in the DET group. The incremental cost per extra delivery in the DET alternative was high, 71 940. The rates of p"
