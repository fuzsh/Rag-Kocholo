        "text": "Here are some of the highlights featured in the video above from our 160-year history:\n\n1864\n\nDNV (Det Norske Veritas) is founded as a membership organization in Oslo, Norway by mutual marine insurance clubs. We establish a uniform set of rules and procedures to assess the condition and seaworthiness of vessels, so that risk can be managed and the right insurance premium set for both ships and their cargo.\n\n1867\n\nThree years later in Hamburg, Germany, a group of 600 ship owners, shipbuilders and insurers gather to found Germanischer Lloyd (GL). (In 2013, DNV and GL merge, and the company changed name to DNV GL, but was renamed to DNV in 2021).\n\n1888\n\nOur first surveyor is posted in China. Ten years later we open our first office in the US and we expand our presence to ports across the globe.\n\n1914\n\nWe’re at the first meeting of what was to become the International Treaty on the Safety of Life at Sea held as a result of the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n1953\n\nWe establish a research department and start pioneering an analytical and scientific approach to ship building. A scientific approach that has become ingrained in how we work with innovation and risk management to provide impartial assurance and advise on safety, quality, efficiency, and sustainability.\n\n1969\n\nWe buy the largest computer in Norway and develop the first software solution for design and optimization of ships and offshore structures.\n\n1970\n\nOil and gas is discovered in the North Sea, and our knowledge about waves, materials and structural integrity, becomes even more valuable. We use our experience and technological competence to develop verification, inspection and risk management services and we are assigned most of the building supervision and inspection on the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\n1976\n\nThe world’s first pipeline rules are published by DNV. By 2008, 65% of all offshore pipelines in the world are built to our standards.\n\n1977\n\nWind energy is introduced as a new business segment. This, and other climate-friendly service areas grow from a strong, research-driven technology base. New rules for wind turbine design are developed. By 2007, 70% of all offshore wind farms are certified by DNV.\n\n1987\n\nThe ISO 9000 quality management standards are introduced, and we become one of the leading companies to certify corporations’ quality and environmental management systems. This takes us into a wide range of industries, and we expand our global footprint.\n\n1994\n\nWe start certifying medical devices in the EU.\n\n2008\n\nWe become the first to break a near monopoly in the US by being authorized to certify quality standards in US hospitals and help them improve patient care. Today, we have certified around 6,000 healthcare organizations.\n\n2010\n\nMore than 6,000 food and beverage companies are certified by us. That has grown to 11,000 today.\n\n2012\n\nElectrification of industry and society is really accelerating. We acquire KEMA and become a globally leading advisor and certifier of cleaner energy, power generation, transmission and distribution.\n\n2013\n\nWe join forces with Germanischer Lloyd (GL) and become the world’s leading classification society. At this point, 1 in 4 classed ships are built to our technical rules and standards. The merger also makes us the number one global provider of certification and advisory services to energy sector.\n\n2017\n\nWe launch Veracity in 2017, an independent platform and marketplace for industry data. Also, at this point, more than a million people use our wide range of industrial software solutions. 2020 In response to the COVID pandemic, we scale up our digital services, remote audits, drone inspections, and AI capabilities.\n\n2023\n\nWe become one of the fastest-growing providers of cyber security services in Europe."
