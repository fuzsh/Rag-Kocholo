        "text": "NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND OR SOUTH AFRICA OR IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THIS TENDER OFFER WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\nOn 16 February 2023, DNV AS (the “Offeror”) announced that it will make a voluntary recommended public cash tender offer for all the issued and outstanding shares (the “Shares”) that are not held by Nixu Corporation (“Nixu” or the “Company”) or any of its subsidiaries and the issued and outstanding stock options (the “Stock Options”) in Nixu (the “Tender Offer”).\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Nixu Board”) has decided to issue the statement below regarding the Tender Offer as required by Chapter 11, Section 13 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act (746/2012, as amended, the “Finnish Securities Markets Act”).\n\nTender Offer in Brief\n\nThe Offeror is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway. The Offeror is a fully owned subsidiary of DNV Group AS, a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway. The ultimate parent of DNV Group AS is Stiftelsen Det Norske Veritas, a free standing, autonomous and independent foundation whose purpose is to safeguard life, property and the environment incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway.\n\nThe Offeror and Nixu have on 16 February 2023 entered into a combination agreement (the “Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which the Offeror will make the Tender Offer for all of the Shares and Stock Options.\n\nThe Tender Offer will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer to be included in the tender offer document to be approved by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, expected to be published by the Offeror on or about 27 February 2023 (the “Tender Offer Document”).\n\nAs at the date of this statement, Nixu has 7,447,219 issued shares, of which 7,445,693 are outstanding Shares and 1,526 of which are held in treasury, and a total of 219,300 outstanding Stock Options, comprising of 63,800 Stock Options 2019A (the “Stock Options 2019A”), 68,000 Stock Options 2019B (the “Stock Options 2019B”) and 87,500 Stock Options 2019C (the “Stock Options 2019C”). According to information provided by the Offeror, the Offeror held on 16 February 2023 75,467 Shares and votes in Nixu.\n\nThe Offeror has reserved the right to buy Shares and Stock Options before, during and/or after the offer period (including any extension thereof and any subsequent offer period) in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd (“Nasdaq Helsinki”) or otherwise.\n\nThe Offer Price\n\nThe share offer price is EUR 13.00 in cash for each Share validly tendered in the Tender Offer (the “Share Offer Price”), subject to any adjustments as set out below.\n\nThe price offered for each Stock Option validly tendered is EUR 0.91 in cash for each outstanding Stock Option 2019A (the “Stock Option 2019A Offer Price”), EUR 3.52 in cash for each outstanding Stock Option 2019B (the “Stock Option 2019B Offer Price”) and EUR 3.05 in cash for each outstanding Stock Option 2019C (the “Stock Option 2019C Offer Price”, and together with Stock Option 2019A Offer Price and Stock Option 2019B Offer Price, the “Stock Option Offer Price”), subject to any adjustments as set out below.\n\nThe Share Offer Price represents a premium of:\n\n67.1 per cent compared to EUR 7.78, the closing price of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki on 15 February 2023, the last trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer;\n\n79.6 per cent compared to EUR 7.24, the three-month volume-weighted average trading price of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer; and\n\n105.6 per cent compared to EUR 6.32, the twelve-month volume-weighted average trading price of the Share on Nasdaq Helsinki immediately preceding the announcement of the Tender Offer.\n\nThe Share Offer Price has been determined based on 7,445,693 Shares, the Stock Option 2019A Offer Price has been determined based on 63,800 Stock Options 2019A, the Stock Option 2019B Offer Price has been determined based on 68,000 Stock Options 2019B and the Stock Option 2019C Offer Price has been determined based on 87,500 Stock Options 2019C.\n\nShould the Company change the number of Shares as at the date of the Combination Agreement as a result of a new share issue, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split) or any other similar transaction with dilutive effect, excluding (i) any subscription for the Company’s shares based on Stock Options or (ii) issue of the Company’s shares pursuant to the Matching Share Plan for the CEO of the Company, or should the Company declare a dividend or otherwise distribute funds or any other assets to its shareholders, or if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur on or prior to the settlement of any of the completion trades under the initial, extended, or subsequent offer period of the Tender Offer, resulting in the distribution of funds with regard to certain Shares not being payable to the Offeror, the Share Offer Price and the Stock Option Offer Price shall be reduced accordingly on a euro-for-euro basis, and in case of dividend or distribution of funds or assets, in respect of such Shares only.\n\nOther information relating to the Tender Offer\n\nPeter Gylfe, Marko Kauppi (himself and on behalf of his wholly-owned company Tenendum Oy), Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Lamy Oy, Parteen Oy, Visio Allocator Fund, and all members of the management team of the Company, including the CEO Teemu Salmi, who own Shares or Stock Options, together representing approximately 22.3 per cent of the Shares and votes in Nixu and 43.8 percent of the Stock Options, have irrevocably undertaken to accept the Tender Offer. These irrevocable undertakings may be terminated among other terms in the event that the Offeror withdraws the Tender Offer, or in the event that a competing offer is announced by a third party with a consideration of at least 10 per cent higher than the Share Offer Price and the Offeror does not match or exceed the consideration offered in such competing offer within a certain period of time, or in the event the Nixu Board withdraws its recommendation (or modifies or changes the recommendation in a manner detrimental to the Tender Offer) other than as a result of an above-mentioned competing offer.\n\nBased on information received from the Offeror, together with the Shares directly held by the Offeror on 16 February 2023, the irrevocable undertakings represented approximately 23.3 per cent of all Shares and votes in Nixu.\n\nThe Tender Offer is conditional upon the satisfaction or waiver by the Offeror of certain customary conditions on or prior to the Offeror’s announcement of the final results of the Tender Offer including, among others, that all necessary approvals by any regulatory authorities, such as the approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland, have been received (or where applicable, the relevant waiting periods have expired) and the Offeror having gained control of more than 90 per cent of the Shares and voting rights in Nixu.\n\nBased on the information made available by the Offeror to the Company, the Offeror has access to capital in sufficient amounts in the form of funds immediately available to the Offeror, for completing the Tender Offer and for financing the potential compulsory redemption proceedings in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, the “Finnish Companies Act”) and the potential payment of the termination fee by the Offeror. The Offeror’s obligation to complete the Tender Offer is not conditional upon availability of financing.\n\nThe offer period under the Tender Offer is expected to commence on or about 28 February 2023 and to expire on or about 17 April 2023, unless the Offeror extends the offer period in order to satisfy the conditions to completion of the Tender Offer, including, among others, receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The Tender Offer is currently expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAs announced in connection with the publication of the Tender Offer, the Combination Agreement includes customary provisions whereby the Nixu Board retains the right to withdraw, modify, amend or decide not to issue its recommendation or take actions contradictory to its earlier recommendation to shareholders and holders of Stock Options to accept the Tender Offer if the Nixu Board considers that, due to materially changed circumstances (including, but not limited to, a competing offer or superior offer), the acceptance of the Tender Offer would no longer be in the best interest of the holders of the Shares and/or Stock Options. The Nixu Board shall provide the Offeror with a reasonable opportunity, during not less than four business days after having informed the Offeror of its intentions to take any such actions, to negotiate with the Nixu Board in respect of such actions. If such an action is connected to a serious written competing offer, which the Nixu Board has determined in good faith to have capability to become a superior offer, the Nixu Board has an obligation to inform the Offeror about the competing offer and give the Offeror a reasonable opportunity, during not less than four business days after such competing offer has been published or after the Offeror has received all material information relating to such competing offer, to negotiate and agree with the Nixu Board on improving the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nFurther, in accordance with the Combination Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and their respective affiliates and representatives to, (a) not solicit, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or solicit or facilitate any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to holders of Shares or Stock Options) that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any competing offer, (b) cease and cause to be terminated any possible discussions, negotiations or other activities related to any competing offer conducted prior to the date of the Combination Agreement and (c) not, upon receipt of a competing offer, directly or indirectly, facilitate or promote the progress of such competing offer, except, in each case, if (and only to the extent that) such competing offer constitutes a superior offer, or, if announced or entered into, would in the reasonable opinion of the Nixu Board, have capability to constitute a superior offer, as applicable, and provided that the Company complies with certain procedures about matters arising from such competing offer before any change of recommendation.\n\nIf the Combination Agreement is terminated due to a superior offer being completed, as further specified in the Combination Agreement, the Company has agreed to reimburse expenses incurred by the Offeror up to the maximum amount of EUR 1,000,000. If the Combination Agreement is terminated due to certain reasons specified in the Combination Agreement, the Offeror has agreed to pay the Company as liquidated damages an amount of EUR 1,000,000.\n\nBackground for the Statement\n\nPursuant to the Finnish Securities Markets Act and the Helsinki Takeover Code issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association (the “Helsinki Takeover Code”), the Nixu Board must issue a public statement regarding the Tender Offer. The statement must include a well-founded assessment of the Tender Offer from the perspective of Nixu and its shareholders and holders of Stock Options as well as of the strategic plans presented by the Offeror in the Tender Offer Document and their likely effects on the operations of, and employment at, Nixu.\n\nFor the purposes of issuing this statement, the Offeror has submitted to the Nixu Board a draft version of the Finnish language Tender Offer Document in the form in which the Offeror has filed it with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority for approval on 17 February 2023 (the “Draft Tender Offer Document”).\n\nIn preparing its statement, the Nixu Board has relied on information provided in the Draft Tender Offer Document by the Offeror and certain other information provided by the Offeror and has not independently verified this information. Accordingly, the Nixu Board’s assessment of the consequences of the Tender Offer on Nixu’s business and employees should be treated with caution.\n\nAssessment Regarding Strategic Plans Presented by the Offeror in the Draft Tender Offer Document and Their Likely Effects on the Operations of, and Employment at, Nixu\n\nInformation Given by the Offeror in the Draft Tender Offer Document\n\nThe Nixu Board has assessed the Offeror’s strategic plans based on the statements made in the Company’s and the Offeror’s announcement regarding the Tender Offer published on 16 February 2023 and the Draft Tender Offer Document.\n\nThe Offeror has placed cyber security at the heart of its growth strategy and aims to build a world-class cyber security services business to support a growing portfolio of more than 100,000 customers in tackling risks emerging from digital transformation. Nixu has become a trusted cyber security partner to businesses across Europe, providing deep expertise and innovation to make cyberspace a secure place.\n\nThe Offeror and Nixu are well positioned to build a leading European cyber security services provider. By combining Nixu’s trusted reputation and domain expertise with the Offeror’s large and diverse customer footprint, industrial cyber security capabilities, strong balance sheet, long-term investment horizon and mature business infrastructure, the two companies can serve the market with greater impact together than could be achieved alone.\n\nThe Offeror will support the acceleration of Nixu’s strategic growth in Europe, and its pursuit to strengthen cash flow. Nixu will become the Offeror’s largest cyber security hub, with continued focus on serving customers in Finland and across Northern Europe. Nixu will play a central role in shaping the future of the Offeror’s cyber security business. Nixu’s employees will be provided with backing for professional development, more resources for growth and greater access to international projects.\n\nThe Offeror has expressed sincere interest in acquiring all Shares and Stock Options in Nixu and is making a compelling offer to Nixu’s shareholders and holders of Stock Options. The Tender Offer enables the Company’s shareholders and holders of Stock Options to realise their held securities in Nixu at an attractive premium.\n\nBased on information made available by the Offeror, the completion of the Tender Offer is not expected to have any immediate material effects on the business operations, assets, or the position of the management or employees, of Nixu. However, as is customary, the Offeror intends to change the composition of the Nixu Board after the completion of the Tender Offer.\n\nBoard Assessment\n\nThe Nixu Board believes that the Offeror’s intention to support the acceleration of Nixu’s strategic growth in Europe and its pursuit to strengthen cash flow will benefit the activities of the Company in the future. The Nixu Board believes that the Company can benefit from the Offeror’s global experience in the industry and will also be able to expand its business into and gain access to new customers in additional geographies. The Nixu Board shares the Offeror’s view that, as a part of the Offeror, Nixu’s employees would be provided with backing for professional development, more resources for growth and greater access to international projects. The Nixu Board also believes that the combined company could be better positioned to attract new employees.\n\nFurther, the Nixu Board considers that the Share Offer Price and Stock Option Offer Price and the credibility of the Offeror as an owner as well as the support by the Company’s major shareholders for the Tender Offer, support the Offeror’s ability to reach more than 90 per cent ownership of the Shares and voting rights in Nixu.\n\nThe Nixu Board considers that the information on the Offeror’s strategic plans concerning Nixu included in the Draft Tender Offer Document is of a general nature. However, based on the information presented to Nixu and the Nixu Board, the Nixu Board believes that the completion of the Tender Offer is not expected to have any immediate material effects on Nixu’s operations or the position of the employees of Nixu.\n\nOn the date of this statement, the Nixu Board has not received from Nixu’s employees any formal statements as to the effects of the Tender Offer to the employment at Nixu.\n\nAssessment of the Tender Offer from the Perspective of Nixu and its Shareholders and Holders of Stock Options\n\nWhen evaluating the Tender Offer, analysing alternative opportunities available to Nixu and concluding on its statement, the Nixu Board has considered several factors, including, but not limited to, Nixu’s recent financial performance, current position and future prospects, the historical performance of the trading price of Nixu’s share and the conditions for the Offeror to complete the Tender Offer.\n\nThe Nixu Board’s assessment of continuing the business operations of Nixu as an independent company has been based on reasonable future-oriented estimates, which include various uncertainties, whereas the Share Offer Price and the premium included therein and the Stock Option Offer Price are not subject to any uncertainty other than the fulfilment of the conditions to completion of the Tender Offer.\n\nThe Nixu Board received a fairness opinion, dated 16 February 2023, from Nixu’s financial adviser, Danske Bank A/S, Finland Branch (“Danske Bank”), to the effect that, as of the date of such fairness opinion, the Share Offer Price and Stock Option Offer Price to be paid to holders of Shares and Stock Options, respectively, pursuant to the Tender Offer were fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, which fairness opinion was based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described in such fairness opinion (the “Fairness Opinion”). The complete Fairness Opinion is attached as Appendix 1 to this statement.\n\nProcess resulting in the Tender Offer\n\nDuring 2022, Nixu was approached by several parties (including the Offeror) that expressed an interest in making a public offer for all the Shares. Following the rejection of an initial indicative offer by the Offeror, and further negotiations with the Offeror, the Nixu Board invited the Offeror and another potential bidder to conduct a due diligence review of the Company. Following the due diligence review, the Nixu Board received non-binding indicative offers from the Offeror and the other potential bidder and assessed the received non-binding indicative offers as well as the option of remaining an independent listed company.\n\nHaving carefully assessed the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, including the preconditions set by the Offeror for launching the Tender Offer, the Nixu Board has concluded that entering into the Combination Agreement, including a customary non-solicitation clause and a customary termination fee, enables an attractive offer and is and continues to be in the best interests of the shareholders and holders of Stock Options of Nixu.\n\nBoard Assessment\n\nThe Nixu Board believes that the consideration offered by the Offeror is fair to the shareholders and holders of Stock Options based on its assessment of the matters and factors, which the Nixu Board has concluded to be material in evaluating the Tender Offer. These matters and factors include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe information and assumptions on the business operations and financial condition of Nixu as at the date of this statement and their expected future development, including an assessment of expected risks and opportunities related to the implementation and execution of Nixu’s new strategy as an independent company;\n\nthe Share Offer Price and the Stock Option Offer Price and the premium being offered for the Shares;\n\nthe historical trading price of the Shares;\n\nirrevocable undertakings given by certain major shareholders of Nixu and all members of the management team of Nixu;\n\ntransaction certainty, and that the conditions of the Tender Offer are reasonable and customary;\n\nvaluation multiples of the Shares compared to the industry multiples before the announcement of the Tender Offer;\n\nvaluations and analysis made and commissioned by the Nixu Board as well as discussions with an external financial adviser; and\n\nthe Fairness Opinion issued by Danske Bank.\n\nThe Nixu Board has investigated and considered trends in the markets and the industry and certain strategic alternatives available to Nixu. Such alternatives include, but are not limited to, remaining an independent listed company. The Nixu Board has also considered the risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives.\n\nThe Nixu Board has concluded that Nixu would also have viable opportunities to develop its business as an independent company for the benefit of Nixu and its shareholders and holders of Stock Options. However, taking into consideration the risks and uncertainties associated with such stand-alone approach, the Nixu Board has concluded, based on its overall assessment, taking into consideration the factors described above, among other matters, that the Tender Offer is a favorable alternative for the shareholders and holders of Stock Options.\n\nRecommendation of the Nixu Board\n\nThe Nixu Board has carefully assessed the Tender Offer and its terms and conditions based on the Draft Tender Offer Document, the Fairness Opinion, and other available information.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Nixu Board considers that the Tender Offer and the amount of the Share Offer Price and Stock Option Offer Price are, under the prevailing circumstances, fair to Nixu’s shareholders and holders of the Stock Options.\n\nGiven the above viewpoints, the members of the Nixu Board, who participated in the decision-making regarding this statement, unanimously recommend that the shareholders and holders of the Stock Options of Nixu accept the Tender Offer.\n\nFour out of five members of the Nixu Board have participated in the decision-making regarding this statement. Marko Kauppi, Deputy Chair of the Nixu Board, has irrevocably undertaken to tender all Shares held directly by him and his wholly-owned investment company Tenendum Oy in the Tender Offer, and has therefore not participated in the decision-making concerning the Combination Agreement by the Nixu Board or in the decision-making concerning the recommendation of the Nixu Board.\n\nCertain Other Matters\n\nThe Nixu Board notes that the combination of Nixu and the Offeror’s operations will, in addition to synergy benefits, pose challenges to both parties, and the transaction may, as is common in such processes, involve unforeseeable risks.\n\nThe Nixu Board notes that the shareholders and holders of the Stock Options of Nixu should also take into account the potential risks related to non-acceptance of the Tender Offer. If the acceptance condition of more than 90 per cent of the Shares and votes is waived, the completion of the Tender Offer would reduce the number of Nixu’s shareholders and the number of shares, which would otherwise be traded on Nasdaq Helsinki. Depending on the number of Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer, this could have an adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the shares in Nixu. Furthermore, pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder that holds more than half of the voting rights carried by the shares present in a company’s general meeting has sufficient voting rights to decide on, among other things, the appointment of board members and distribution of dividends and a shareholder that holds more than two-thirds of the shares and voting rights carried by the shares present in a company’s general meeting has sufficient voting rights to decide upon certain corporate transactions, including, but not limited to, a merger of the company into another company, an amendment of the articles of association of the company, a change of domicile of the company and an issue of shares in the company in deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emptive subscription rights.\n\nPursuant to Chapter 18 of the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder that holds more than 90 per cent of all shares and votes in a company shall have the right to acquire and, subject to a demand by other shareholders, also be obligated to redeem the shares owned by the other shareholders. In such case, the Shares held by Nixu’s shareholders, who have not accepted the Tender Offer, may be redeemed through redemption proceedings under the Finnish Companies Act in accordance with the conditions set out therein.\n\nNixu and the Offeror have undertaken to comply with the Helsinki Takeover Code referred to in Chapter 11, Section 28 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.\n\nThis statement of the Nixu Board does not constitute investment or tax advice, and the Nixu Board does not specifically evaluate herein the general price development or the risks relating to the shares in general. Shareholders and holders of Stock Options must independently decide whether to accept the Tender Offer, and they should take into account all the relevant information available to them, including information presented in the Tender Offer Document and this statement as well as any other factors affecting the value of the Shares or Stock Options.\n\nNixu has appointed Danske Bank as its financial adviser and Borenius Attorneys Ltd as its legal adviser in connection with the Tender Offer.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Nixu\n\nAppendix 1: Fairness Opinion\n\nFurther information:\n\nCEO Teemu Salmi, Nixu Corporation\n\ne-mail: teemu.salmi@nixu.com\n\n+358 9 478 1011\n\nDistribution:\n\nNasdaq Helsinki\n\nMain media\n\nwww.nixu.com\n\nNixu in brief:\n\nNixu is a cybersecurity services company that has been shaping the future through cybersecurity for over three decades.

IN PARTICULAR, THIS RELEASE IS NOT AN OFFER TO BUY OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO SELL ANY SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN, AND IS NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE TENDER OFFER, IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, HONG KONG, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND OR SOUTH AFRICA. INVESTORS SHALL ACCEPT THE TENDER OFFER FOR THE SHARES ONLY ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN A TENDER OFFER DOCUMENT. OFFERS WILL NOT BE MADE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE EITHER THE TENDER OFFER OR ACCEPTANCE THEREOF IS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR WHERE ANY TENDER OFFER DOCUMENT OR REGISTRATION OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD APPLY IN ADDITION TO THOSE UNDERTAKEN IN FINLAND.\n\nTHE TENDER OFFER IS NOT BEING MADE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND, WHEN PUBLISHED, THE TENDER OFFER DOCUMENT AND RELATED ACCEPTANCE FORMS WILL NOT AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, FORWARDED OR TRANSMITTED INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\nTHIS RELEASE HAS BEEN PREPARED IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINNISH LAW, THE RULES OF NASDAQ HELSINKI AND THE HELSINKI TAKEOVER CODE AND THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED IF THIS RELEASE HAD BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF FINLAND.\n\nInformation for Shareholders of Nixu in the United States\n\nThe Tender Offer will be made for the issued and outstanding shares in Nixu, which is domiciled in Finland, and is subject to Finnish disclosure and procedural requirements. The Tender Offer is made in the United States in compliance with Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Regulation 14E (in each case, subject to any exemptions or relief therefrom, if applicable) and otherwise in accordance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Finnish law, including with respect to the Tender Offer timetable, settlement procedures, withdrawal, waiver of conditions and timing of payments, which are different from those of the United States. Shareholders in the United States are advised that the Shares are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange and that Nixu is not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and is not required to, and does not, file any reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) thereunder.\n\nThe Tender Offer is made to Nixu’s shareholders resident in the United States on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Nixu to whom an offer is made. Any information documents, including this release, are being disseminated to U.S. shareholders on a basis comparable to the method that such documents are provided to Nixu’s other shareholders.\n\nTo the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations, the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its broker’s affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates, as applicable) may from time to time after the date of this release and during the pendency of the Tender Offer, and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer and combination, directly or indirectly, purchase or arrange to purchase, the Shares or any securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for such Shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland, such information will be disclosed by means of a stock exchange or press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Nixu of such information. In addition, the financial advisers to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Nixu, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities. To the extent required in Finland, any information about such purchases will be made public in Finland in the manner required by Finnish law.\n\nNeither the SEC nor any U.S. state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Tender Offer, passed upon the merits or fairness of the Tender Offer, or passed any comment upon the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of this release. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States.\n\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Tender Offer by a U.S. holder of Shares may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each holder of Shares is urged to consult its independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Tender Offer.\n\nIt may be difficult for Nixu’s shareholders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal securities laws since the Offeror and Nixu are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions and some or all of their respective officers and directors may be residents of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Nixu’s shareholders may not be able to sue the Offeror or Nixu or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may be difficult to compel the Offeror and Nixu and their respective affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court’s judgment.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis release contains statements that, to the extent they are not historical facts, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, expectations, projections, objectives, targets, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, competitive strengths and weaknesses, plans or goals relating to financial position, future operations and development, business strategy and the trends in the industries and the political and legal environment and other information that is not historical information. In some instances, they can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “intends,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or variations on comparable terminology. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions, both general and specific, and risks exist that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
