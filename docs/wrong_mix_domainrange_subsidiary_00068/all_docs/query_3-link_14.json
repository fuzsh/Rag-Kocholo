        "text": "Andreas Echtermeyer is Professor for composites and polymers in the Department of Engineering Design and Materials at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) Trondheim. He joined the university full time in 2008 after having been an adjunct professor since 2003. Previously he worked for Det Norske Veritas (DNV) as senior principal engineer in the section “Structural Integrity and Laboratories” and was responsible for composites and polymers in offshore applications. He continues to be a consultant for DNV. He received his PhD in Materials Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his Diploma in Physics from the Technical University of Munich.\n\nHe has 18 years of industry experience with composite applications. He is author or co-author of more than 50 articles and more than 200 technical reports. He was the main contributor and responsible for the development of DNV’s offshore standards for composites offshore and composite risers. He was further heavily involved in the development of the rules for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) composite pressure vessels for ships, of the ISO standard update for umbilicals and guidelines for adhesive joint technology for repair of metal structures and of the Recommended Practice for Qualification of New Technology. He has been project manager or responsible of many national and international research projects as well as industrial development projects.\n\nComposites and Polymers with emphasis on:\n\n· Long term performance, fatigue, creep, environmental degradation.\n\n· Mechanical and adhesive joints, especially between composites, polymers and metals.\n\n· Production methods such as resin infusion, filament winding, extrusion.\n\n· Multiscale modeling : atomic structure-engineering property relationship\n\n· Combination of experimental testing and theoretical modelling\n\n· Materials and components for the offshore industry\n\nPROJECTS\n\nNICOLHY 2024-2026\n\nEU Project\n\nInsulation materials and solutions for liquid hydrogen tanks\n\nAlloc 2019-2022\n\nNorwegian Research Council, PFI, industrial partners\n\nImproving floor and side panels in buildings with composites\n\nThor 2019-2022\n\nEuropean Union (EU project)\n\nThermoplastic Composite pressure vessels for hydrogen\n\nNTNU part: Real time inspection with embedded optical fibers\n\nFlexProp 2019-2021\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef, Kongsberg\n\nBend twist coupling in composite ship propellers\n\nMoZees 2018-2020\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Ife, Sintef, industrial partners\n\nComposite pressure vessels for hydrogen transport (NTNU/MTP part)\n\nAffordable Composites 2015-2018\n\nNorwegian Research Council, DNVGL, industrial partners\n\nMultiscale modeling of long-term properties of composites in harsh environments\n\nNovel Fuel 2014-2017\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Rolls Royce\n\nCasting large metal components into epoxy – cure modeling\n\nHyPactor 2014-2017\n\nEuropean Union (EU project)\n\nComposite pressure vessels for transporting hydrogen\n\nTesting and modelling the effect of impact damage\n\nTREC 2014-2017\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef\n\nSealing solutions for arctic conditions\n\nMultiscale modeling of polymers 2013-2015\n\nInternal\n\nModeling of long-term performance\n\nDeliverHy 2012 - 2013\n\nEuropean Union (EU) (FCH JU), Air Liquid, Hexagon, H2L, CCS\n\nTransport of Hydrogen in large composite pressure vessels\n\nLIFT 2012 - 2013\n\nNordic project\n\nComposite metal joints for trucks\n\nPolylife 2011 - 2013\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef, FMC Kongsberg, Seaflex\n\nChange of properties of polymers under long-term exposure to chemicals\n\nCopatch 2010 - 2014\n\nEuropean Union (EU project)\n\nRepair of metal components with composite patches, adhesives joints\n\nInspecting joints real-time with embedded optical fibers\n\nCompact 2010 - 2014\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef\n\nModeling of composite materials with impact damage\n\nNOWITECH 2009 - 2015\n\nOffhore Wind Turbines\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef, Devold AMT\n\nRelation between production parameters and fatigue properties of composites\n\nDevelopment of adaptive wind turbine blades, changing shape under loading\n\nDemanding Polyolefin Applications 2009 - 2013\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef, Brederaw Shaw, Nexans\n\nModeling production and thermal properties of insulation materials for steel pipes\n\nArctic Materials 2009 - 2013\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef\n\nAdhesive and mechanical composite metal joints at low and varying temperatures\n\nTesting of carbon fiber rods and their end fittings 2008 - 2009\n\nAker Solutions\n\nShort and long term testing\n\nSmooth Pipe 2008 - 2010\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef\n\nLong term properties of coatings inside steel pipes\n\nDevelopment of extremely large wind turbine blades 2006 - 2009\n\nNorwegian Research Council, Sintef, internal\n\nDevelop production methods, test methods and analysis tools\n\nJoint for carbon fiber rods 2006 - 2008\n\nIdea fond, Aker Solutions\n\nDevelop and test pultruded carbon fiber rods and their end-fittings"
