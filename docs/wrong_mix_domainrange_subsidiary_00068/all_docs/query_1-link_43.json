        "text": "Predictive Engineering has been instrumental in assisting LifePort build its engineering capabilities with LS Dyna based analyses. The primary benefit of these efforts is an improved understanding of the internal system loads that are developed during an impulse event. The product design cycle is expected to be improved component sizing iterations, design efficiency and confidence of the product during certification efforts.\n\nLifePort has chosen Predictive Engineering to work on consecutive projects due to its satisfaction and confidence in the services provided. These efforts have been collaborative, prompt and to the level of quality that was expected. In situations where difficulties arose, they took the necessary actions to ensure our satisfaction remained intact.\n\nWe would highly recommend Predictive Engineering as a resource to expand your engineering needs and look forward to future endeavors with them.\n\nCraig Hallquist, Manager of Research & Development\n\nOver many years Pacific Rim Engineered Products (PREP) has earned a reputation as a premium supplier for robust and well performing equipment for the oil and gas industry (on-shore and off-shore).\n\nIn 2008, two new challenging projects came up on the horizon to again prove to one of our customers about who we are and what type of custom solutions we are capable of providing.\n\nThe projects contained two major segments for an off-shore drilling package – namely a 1000 Ton TopDrive and its respective Drawwork. Both products faced tough restrictions such as: maximum allowable weight, maximum allowable overall dimensions, minimum required performance data, certification requirements by DNV (Det Norske Veritas), and last but not least, a tight project timeline combined with a budget that was considered as a challenge on it's own.\n\nWhat a blessing to get Dr. George Laird, Predictive Engineering into our project team. It has not been the first time to PREP to have George \"on board\" but these last two projects have beaten everything else in complexity and quickness of execution. George, I owe you a big thank you for your highly valuable input to both of these important and challenging projects.\n\nIf we were to grade your service to us it would clearly be in the \"5-Star\" range. To name a few reasons, it would be the unconventional and highly professional manner you approached the various FEA challenges, the way we could rely on your timely delivery of professional results, or the way you interconnected with the entire project team. Occasionally it was not easy to some of us to understand why you did not want to go down a certain path until you educated us and demonstrated that FEA is sometimes more than just pretty pictures.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to the entire project team working together with you and Predictive Engineering. The two products successfully delivered to our end-customer could not have been created under these challenging parameters without your input. You never have been just a \"supplier\" to us. You always have been – and will be - a fully integrated and very well respected member of our project teams. The next projects with new and unique FEA challenges are already waiting around the corner where we are looking forward to get you \"on board\" again.\n\nMy honest recommendation to you, the reader of this testimonial: If you are looking for an exceptionally valuable member of your project team that will provide you a \"worry-free life\" in your FEA world there is only one straight answer: Dr. George Laird with Predictive Engineering. Any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nErich Pfnuer, Project Manager\n\nWe came to George Laird and Predictive Engineering with a problem. The FEA analyses that we had done to date for our project just did not reflect what we were seeing in physical testing. We were hoping for a fresh perspective. We got that and much more. George put forth a tremendous amount of work into our analysis and was able to get the same results that we saw in testing. We worked together on the project which helped make sure that the analysis did reflect how our device operates, and allowed us to try several iterations quickly. This also educated me quite a bit on the inner workings of FEA. He was also able to explain in detail the reason our original analyses were off. Once the reason was uncovered, it made perfect sense from a mechanical standpoint. From there, it was an easy leap to test the new design and have confidence in the results. George went well above and beyond the scope of the job and remained in budget and on time. Without his efforts, we likely would still be facing the same issue with FEA results not matching the actual test results. He has proven to me that he is someone that is dedicated to getting the job done right, and that he will not stop until it is right. In addition, his candor and straightforward approach in attacking a problem is refreshing. I highly recommend his consultant services. He has proven himself to be an asset to Bioject.\n\nTed Sedler, Mechanical Engineer\n\nI just want to say what a pleasure it is to work with a true professional and a person who is a master at his craft. Since there is nothing new in the world of heat transfer and the laws of thermal dynamics, most problems can be solved with a calculator and a number two pencil. But that will generally only get you into the right ball park. To know what game is being played on the field we call on our man George Laird, PhD!\n\nYou give us a detailed view of what's happening inside the box; your simulations make the numbers come alive. You have made communicating to the customer and our management team easy by presenting your easy to follow layer-by-layer analysis.\n\nYou have exceeded all expectations by working through the night with me as we diligently pressed for solutions by dawn. There are very few consultants with your level of dedication.\n\nRoland Jasmin, Senior Project Manager\n\nDr. George Laird has been providing outstanding FEA analysis and support for our Nastran users at Key Technology, Inc for many years, so he was our obvious choice to help us solve a critical air flow problem using CFdesign software. Keeping the bottom camera windows clean on sorting machines, that we design and manufacture for the food processing industry, has always been a challenge, and is becoming increasing more critical with newer and higher performance viewing and scanning technologies. George brought his computers and CFdesign software to our site, and we spent several days working through about 10 geometry iterations to determine the optimum design for a new air shroud concept to protect the windows. The design was a delicate balance of a number of functional requirements that would be difficult to arrive at without a good analysis tool and Georges expertise and consultation. We built and tested a prototype shroud of this design and found that it not only matched perfectly with the final analysis model, but met or exceeded all of our design criteria. No further tweaking of the design was required, and George completed the overall task in approximately 1/3rd the estimated hours and cost. Solving this long standing problem will greatly benefit our company, and our customers.\n\nSuccess is always great, and working with George is both fun and educational. I certainly look forward to the next opportunity to work with George.\n\nPhil Hoffman, Mechanical Principal Engineer\n\nOur company designs medical ultrasound systems for use in therapeutic (tissue heating) applications. The design of our ultrasound applicators requires an extensive understanding of the complex interplay between high frequency vibrational behavior of piezo-ceramic elements, their acoustic matching layers, and their heat generation, heat transfer and structural behavior, both to maximize their efficiency and to avoid thermal stress or other mechanical failures.In addition, to appropriately \"dose\" the patient, we must be able predict the tissue heating behavior resulting from the acoustic energy delivery and cooling by blood flow in the body. To understand and predict these behaviors we have depended on simulations and analysis performed using Femap with a variety of solvers, all under the able guidance and analysis of Dr. George Laird. In addition to providing key insights into the thermal, vibrational and thermal stress aspects of our designs, George Laird (the enthusiastic teacher) has been very effective in training us in Femap and in unraveling some of the \"black art\" of FEA. George's combination of theoretical mechanics expertise and practical problem solving have helped us zero in quickly and solve key issues. His unselfish sharing of his extensive knowledge reflect not only his commitment to directly helping his clients, but his willingness to enable them to help themselves. We feel very fortunate in having him on our team.\n\nMichael Sekins, Ph.D.\n\nFor the past 25 years we have done our own in house design and testing of our products, however we recently ran into a chassis control challenge that we were unable to resolve internally or with the help of engineers we had used in the past. Out of frustration we resorted to the trusty old yellow pages, but weren't having much luck finding a firm that understood our unique situation. They were all willing to do a lot of analysis, but none were willing to offer any course of action. One of the firms we contacted suggested Predictive Engineering as they were well known for their cost effective FEA services. I knew we were on to something when I spoke to George for the first time. He asked a lot of questions and actually listened to our answers! End result, in about 3 months and on schedule George solved the problem we had been struggling with for nearly 5 years. And better yet, his simple design solution is easier to manufacture!\n\nScott Hart, Volvo Division Leader\n\nMy relationship with George Laird began about 5 years ago while in the middle of a vibratory shaker development project that wasnt going well. With his help he quickly and cost effectively identified the problem that we were having and verified that our next effort was on the right track. Through out that development project and others he helped solve some very difficult vibration and structural issues with the shaker designs in addition to training myself and several others here at Key Technology in the various aspects of FEA. Whether it is finding a mistake in one of my models to performing contract engineering he is always there if we need him.\n\nHis dependability, real world knowledge and ability to find the root of a problem quickly have earned him the respect of many here at Key. In addition his ability and willingness to teach has helped me grow and expand my abilities. I consider him a wonderful colleague, asset, and most of all a friend who comes highly recommended for structural and vibration analysis, mechanical design optimization, design simplification, and Nastran support.\n\nPete Jones, Senior Engineering Technician\n\nWithout the help from George Laird, our project would have taken us much longer than the final nine months from start to finish. George was not only the FEA expert on our team, but also gave us engineering insight into the detailed engineering level of our design.The really cool thing is that we took the FEA data and compared it to our strain gauge data and it matched up. This is some of the stuff engineers dream of.\n\nGeorge Laird, as far as I am concerned, is the best FEA engineer I have worked with. I would recommend him to anyone. In fact, our new product is one of the most successful products that we have ever developed and is still going strong after its market release in May of 2001.\n\nBrad Stager, Manager of Product Development"
