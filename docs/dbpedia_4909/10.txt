Byron Anthony says Swansea City Under-18s reaped the rewards of a ‘complete performance’ in their 1-0 victory over in-form Colchester United.

The young Swans claimed their first win of Anthony’s reign thanks to Michael Murphy’s first-half strike at Landore.

The hosts had chances to extend their lead after the break with Ben Lloyd hitting the post, while substitute Geoff Bony was denied from close range.

At the other end, they defended well to keep out a Colchester side fresh from three consecutive wins – during which they had scored a total of 12 goals - and secure their first clean sheet of the season.

The Swans have been unlucky in recent weeks; narrowly losing to Middlesbrough following a positive performance in the FA Youth Cup tie, and conceding late equaliser in their entertaining 4-4 draw with Millwall.

But Anthony was pleased to see his players get their win, which he feels has been a long time coming.

“I’m proud of the players. There’s a happy dressing room in there,” he said.

“In my opinion, they’ve put in a complete performance.

“They stuck to the game plan – individually and collectively. We had a solid foundation, Colchester found it hard to break us down and when they did, there were bodies on the line.

“Since I’ve come in, we’ve tried to build and it does take time when working with individuals, with units and as a team.

“We got our just rewards in the end. We had four or five chances in the second half, where would could’ve scored more goals.

“But overall, it was a performance that’s been long overdue.

“We’ll take a 1-0 win and a smiling dressing room, which we want to see more often than not.”
