Add William Byron's name to the list of drivers competing in Late Model action at North Wilkesboro Speedway next week.

Byron, now partnered with Anthony Campi Racing, announced his plans to run in the ASA STARS National Tour event at North Wilkesboro as well as other Super Late Model events with the team this year.

"Love getting back into a super late model for a few more races this year," said Byron on social media. "Looking forward to running with Anthonyâ€™s group. One of my favorite cars to drive, will be cool to run North Wilkesboro first as well."

Byron has ramped up his Super Late Model appearances in the past couple of years, and has been incredibly competitive in those starts. In 2022, Byron won the Clyde Hart Memorial and Orange Blossom 100 at New Smyrna Speedway, the second race of Easter Bunny 150 weekend at Hickory Motor Speedway, the Slinger Nationals, the Money in the Bank 150 at Berlin Raceway. Byron also won this year's Clyde Hart Memorial in February.

However, one Super Late Model race Byron was unable to take part in last year was the ASA Southern Super Series' appearance at the Racetrack Revival at North Wilkesboro, due to NASCAR Cup Series commitments at Richmond Raceway. That changes this year, with the ASA STARS National Tour event on Tuesday, May 16 being part of the buildup to the NASCAR All-Star Race at North Wilkesboro on Sunday, May 21.
