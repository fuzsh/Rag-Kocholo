        "text": "Byron Anthony Mills Jr., of Norman, OK, passed away unexpectedly on Friday, April 3, 2020. He was born on September 11, 1950, in Pawhuska, OK to father, Byron A. Mills Sr. and mother, Mamie Marie Big Eagle. Byron was a proud member of the Osage Nation, where he participated in ceremonial dances for many years. He was an intelligent and funny man and a wonderful storyteller. Byron had the opportunity to live, work, and travel to many different places in his lifetime. He was an avid golfer and pool player and loved history and the blues. He was most proud of graduating from The University of Oklahoma with his bachelor’s degree and was a lifelong Sooner fan.\n\nByron is survived by his daughter, Melody Wuest (Nick McNutt) of Sheboygan, WI, four grandchildren, Keane Schmidt, Ethan Schmidt, Tristan Schmidt, and Ellessandra Schmidt, and one great-granddaughter, Kinleigh Schmidt. Byron is further survived by his sister, Delores Elliott (Tim), of Norman, OK, and nieces, Tammy Arce (Greg), and Connie Cavin, also of Norman, OK. He is also survived by his dear friend Maggie Milliken, of Norman, OK, cousins, a grandniece and grandnephew, and other relations throughout the country. Byron was preceded in death by his father and mother, and one nephew, Tracey Cavin.\n\nByron will be laid to rest beside his father and mother in Pawhuska, OK. A memorial service for Byron will be held at a later date, when people are able to congregate once again. Well-wishers may contact the family through the funeral home website at www.tribute.care. Memorial donations may be made in Byron’s name directly to the University of Oklahoma football program.\n\nThe family wishes to thank the first responders of Norman, OK, Norman Regional Healthplex Hospital, and Dr. Kumar Ennamuri and his staff for their many years of compassionate and excellent care."
