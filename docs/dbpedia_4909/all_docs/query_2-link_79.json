Born in Burlington, VT, Charlie was raised in Foxhall Village, Washington, DC. He was the cherished son of Dr. Michael Joseph Halberstam and Linda Brackett, who preceded him in death.\n\nCharlie leaves behind a legacy of love and devotion, forever etched in the hearts of those who knew him. He was survived by his brother Eben Gile Halberstam (Barbara Miller Halberstam). His love of 40 years, Carol Bradley Hurst Halberstam, was not only his partner but also his best friend, sharing a bond that surpasses the bounds of time. Together, they created a beautiful family, with Charlie being a loving and devoted father to Michael Hurst Halberstam, Letitia “Letty” Halberstam Kellow (Robert James Kellow), and Samuel Gile Halberstam (deceased). Charlie found immense joy in being a grandfather to Callie Bradley Kellow.\n\nHe is also survived by his father-and mother-in-law, John Edward Hurst IV and Letitia “Letty” Trimper Hurst, his brothers-in-law, John “Jay” Edward Hurst V, William “Bill” Bell Hurst (Julia Ann Zachar), and Byron “Bo” Watson Hurst, and his nieces and nephews, Ashtyn Hurst Baker (Bradley Philip Baker), Cortland Bradley Hurst, Roxanne Nicole Zachar and Jake William Hurst. Also, he leaves behind numerous close friends who will forever cherish his memory.\n\nCharlie was a pillar of strength and support, a steady anchor for all who knew him. Renowned for his unyielding patience and kindness, he embraced life with an unwavering sense of love, optimism and humor. Charlie’s inherent belief in good served as a guiding light to all who crossed his path. With his personable and charismatic nature, he left a lasting impression on everyone he encountered.\n\nFamily was of utmost importance to Charlie, with their happiness being his sole priority. His generosity knew no bounds, as he selflessly extended himself to others without hesitation. He was the embodiment of unconditional love, always willing to go above and beyond for those in his life.\n\nAn entrepreneur at heart, Charlie was intellectually curious and constantly sought out new endeavors, approaching life with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.\n\nWhether he was at the beach, reading, fishing, golfing, or simply spending quality time with loved ones, Charlie embraced each moment with an unmatched zest for life.\n\nCharlie Halberstam has left an indelible mark on the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing him. A man of integrity, love, and compassion, he exemplified the virtues of a true gentleman. As we bid farewell to Charlie, let us celebrate his remarkable life and honor the legacy of kindness and selflessness he leaves behind. May his memory live on forever in our hearts, reminding us of the immeasurable impact one person can make in the world.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a memorial contribution in memory of Charlie’s name to the Maasai Girls Education Fund https://maasaigirlseducation.org/ and One Montgomery Green https://onemontgomerygreen.org/\n\nFrom Strunk Funeral Homes & Crematory\n\nSandra Capone Cooke, 71, Vero Beach\n\nFebruary 7, 1953 – June 25, 2024\n\nSandra Capone Cooke was born February 7th, 1953 in Houston, PA, but raised in Vero Beach, FL. She was the daughter of Verna Mae Suriano and John James Capone. After junior high, Sandra moved to New Jersey and graduated from Metuchen High School. She then went to Slippery Rock University where she studied to become a Spanish teacher. She spent her junior year in Valencia, Spain and had a lifelong love for that country, visiting Spain several times since then.\n\nSandi returned to Vero Beach after college and taught in the bilingual program in Fellsmere, FL for two years. In 1979 she met her husband to be, Churchill Cooke, who convinced her to move with him to New Mexico where he’d been living. She spent the next ten years teaching in several towns there until she settled in Ruidoso, married Churchill, and gave birth to Barbara Jane Cooke. Two years later she discovered that there was a need for bilingual educators in the central valley of California, so moved her little family first to Corcoran, CA then Visalia, CA where they spent the next twenty seven years teaching. In 2016, after they retired, she decided she wanted to move back to Vero Beach to be close to the beach and be surrounded by some of her remaining relatives. Barbara, her husband Garry, and their son Arlo also moved to Vero Beach as well. Sandi loved this because she could be close not only to her daughter but her one and only grandson. Sandi was an active member of Vero Cycling, the First Presbyterian Church, and our local ukulele group. Her true passion, though, was dogs and cats, especially black cats.\n\nIn late May, she was having difficulty breathing and had a pain in her abdomen which turned out to be liver cancer. She went into the hospital and had a heart attack as well. After three weeks of trying different medications, her body just basically gave up and she passed away June 25th. Sadly, they celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary two days earlier.\n\nSandra is survived by her husband Churchill, her daughter Barbara, son-in-law Garry, grandson Arlo, sister Barbara Alice, who lives in Hendersonville, NC, six nieces, a nephew, and their children, some who live here in Vero Beach. Sandra will indeed be missed by us all.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please donate money to your local no kill animal shelter. I’m sure Sandi would appreciate that.\n\nTo plant Memorial Trees in memory of SANDRA C. COOKE, please click here to visit our Sympathy Store.\n\nFrom Strunk Funeral Homes & Crematory\n\nLois R.
