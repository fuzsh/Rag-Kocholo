        "text": "The Best Poem Of James Byron Anthony\n\nA Sadness\n\nIn which light are your eyes best illustrated?\n\nIn the dull energy-conserving hum fiend?\n\nThat dull buzz which highlights make up\n\nAnd serves to remind that they are beautified by falsities,\n\nOr the sun who with her own natural splendour in mind,\n\nCuts at the deep blue pools with jealousy and rage?\n\nDoes light itself only torment as the succubus draw out emotion,\n\nPuppeteer the strings of adoration and melt the ice heart with a honeyed peer?\n\nWhat then is left if not light?\n\nIn darkness do I find my accolade best received?\n\nAs with no illumination, no candles, no lamps, no fires,\n\nThe harsh oceans have no effect, nothing,\n\nExisting as commonplace organs in Notre Dame.\n\nBut, to live in a world of darkness is to live without the spark,\n\nThe astonishment, no more bewildered by those purified tormentors.\n\nMy banishment from beauty and as Shakespeare in works,\n\nByron in intercourse and Wilmot in life:\n\nI down my woe, and fill my glass with misery."
