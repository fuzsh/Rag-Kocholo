        "text": "Byron Anthony Morgan, 64, of Gary, Indiana passed away February 7, 2022. He was born on August 1, 1957 in Gary, Indiana to the parents of Auston and Dempsie Morgan.\n\nSurvivors of Mr. Morgan include his sisters Joycelin (Ronald) Bostic, Rachelle (Michael) Ceaser; brothers Austin (Sheila) Morgan, Gregory (Paula) Morgan and many family and friends.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his mother and father Dempsie and Austin Morgan.\n\nByron was employed as a steel worker and barber. He loved God and sports. Byron was loved by his family and will be deeply missed. The bible says in Romans 6:23 “for the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Byron now has eternal life and is truly free.\n\nThe family would like to express a special thanks to those family members and friends that continually supported Byron throughout his life's journey. Your love and commitment are greatly appreciated.\n\nA Celebration of Byron's life will be held at a later date.\n\nArrangements are being handled by Bell Mortuary & Crematory, Royster-Askin Sandrock Chapel, 2310 W. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46222.\n\nOnline condolences at www.bellmortuary.com"
