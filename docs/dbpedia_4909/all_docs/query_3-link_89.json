        "text": "The following was printed on Byron Johnson's HOF plaque:\n\nByron Johnson was part of the best guard tandem in the history of Siena Heights basketball. Johnson, along with NAIA All-American and SHU Hall of Famer Anthony Staffney, led the Saints to three straight WHAC Tournament Championships from 1996-98. In his last two seasons, the Saints posted an overall record of 58-16 and set a standard of excellence by which all SHU basketball teams will forever measure themselves.\n\nJohnson earned both All-WHAC Conference First Team and All-WHAC Defensive Team honors in 1997 and 1998. He earned NAIA All-America Honorable Mention recognition in his senior season and shared Team Most Valuable Player honors with Anthony Staffney as a junior in 1997. The Saints captured both regular season and conference tournament titles in 1997 and became the third Siena Heights basketball team to win 30 games in a season. Coach Fred Smith’s club also advanced to the NAIA Division II National Championship game and Johnson was named to the National Championship All-Tournament Team.\n\nJohnson is ranked among the all-time Siena Heights leaders in nearly every statistical category. At the time of his induction, he ranks #8 all-time in scoring with 1,444 career points and is #5 in steals and #11 in assists.\n\nThis year’s Hall of Fame team is the 1997 National Tournament runner-up men’s basketball team; and it’s fitting that we recognize and induct one of the most talented and memorable players from that outstanding team…Byron Johnson."
