        "text": "Profile\n\nAnthony Chan SC has a broad civil litigation and advisory practice with an emphasis on public law and commercial law. Prior to his appointment as Senior Counsel on 20 May 2023, he was recognized by both Chambers and Partners and Legal 500 as a leading junior in his areas of expertise and was regarded as “probably one of the best junior counsel in town” and “on the up and up”.\n\nIn his public law practice, Anthony has considerable experience in constitutional and administrative law litigations, civil liberty cases, town planning, judicial reviews generally and election petitions. Notable cases include acting for the Government in its successful defence of the constitutionality of the Small House Policy and the Co-location arrangement, and in advising the LegCo President on measures to resolve the filibustering of the election of the House Committee Chairman. He also advised and appeared for the LegCo President in the series of oath-taking cases and filibustering cases. Other highlights include representing the Bar in a case that confirms the distinction between counsel and solicitor advocates, and in successfully defending a constitutional challenge against the supplementary occupation rule.\n\nAnthony’s substantial commercial practice encompasses property disputes (compulsory sale, adverse possession and encroachment), shareholders’ disputes, insolvency matters and general contractual disputes. Anthony’s private client work include acting for family members and the committees in mental health and related proceedings (such as asset recovery and statutory will) and advising ultra-high net worth individuals on succession planning. Notably, he appeared in the leading case on the applicable principles on mental capacity in the context of the Mental Health Ordinance. Other areas of expertise include conflict of laws, breach of confidence (trade secrets), regulatory and disciplinary matters, building appeals, matrimonial finance and contempt of court proceedings. He also has a significant construction and arbitration practice."
