        "text": "A lead pastor at a megachurch in north Texas is resigning for inappropriate actions, church elders announced in a sermon Sunday. Following the pastor’s departure, a former longtime pastor at Gateway Church, who was accused of misconduct in a recent lawsuit, has taken the helm as interim head pastor.\n\nJosiah Anthony, lead pastor at Cross Timbers Church in Argyle, Texas, resigned after elders learned he had engaged in “inappropriate and hurtful” actions, Elder John Chalk said. Chalk shared the news in broad terms while reading from a statement.\n\n“Josiah has been in a prolonged and sustained season of struggle with his emotional and mental health which has been very painful for him and those around him,” Chalk told the congregation. “Throughout this struggle, some of Josiah’s decisions and actions were inappropriate and hurtful to current and former members of the CT family and staff.”\n\nThe “events and circumstances” involving Anthony happened over the course of a few years, Chalk noted.\n\n“During this time, Josiah was not forthcoming and transparent with the staff and the elder board,” Chalk continued. “Once all of this came to light over the last few weeks, it became evident that Josiah could not continue to serve as our lead pastor.”\n\nChalk said elders then asked Anthony to resign, and the pastor agreed.\n\nThe Argyle Police Department told the local publication WFAA that there are no open investigations regarding Cross Timbers. Police added that they have no “knowledge of the circumstances surrounding changes to their leadership team.”\n\nChalk added elders felt it was vital to share the truth of Anthony’s resignation with the church.\n\nAnthony first started working at Cross Timbers in 2014 as a student pastor, according to his LinkedIn. From there, he worked his way up and became senior pastor in 2022. In his role, he oversaw a congregation of 5,000 and supervised more than 60 employees.\n\n“My passion lies in fostering spiritual growth, nurturing community relationships, and advocating for social justice initiatives,” his LinkedIn said.\n\nWhile elders search for a new lead pastor, Cross Timbers Executive Pastor Byron Copeland will take over as interim pastor, Chalk said.\n\nCopeland worked at the controversial Gateway Church for nearly 20 years, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nHe was also accused of misconduct in a 2023 civil lawsuit filed by Rachel Childress against Gateway.\n\nChildress alleged that former Gateway Pastor Aldean “Al” Pearson harassed her by trying to “physically touch her” and making “inappropriate remarks,” The Roys Report (TRR) previously reported.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Childress said she reported Pearson to Copeland and several other staff members, but they failed to listen and act on her accusations.\n\nWhen she first informed Copeland of Pearson’s harassment in 2020, he “sympathized with her but did nothing,” the lawsuit states. Then in 2021, she reported her hostile work environment to Copeland and other staff again.\n\nAfter this, Copeland allegedly “aggressively confronted” Childress, the lawsuit said.\n\n“Copeland backed Ms. Childress into a corner of the room they were in and threatened to fire her if she didn’t shut up and stop stirring up drama,” the lawsuit continues. Later that evening, Copeland reportedly sent her an apology over Slack.\n\nGateway Church has made headlines in recent months over the bombshell allegations that its founder Robert Morris sexually abused Cindy Clemishire, beginning in 1982, when she was 12 years old.\n\nMorris has since resigned from the church’s top position while Gateway leaders claimed they did not know the age of his victim and the length of her abuse, TRR previously reported.\n\nLast week, James Morris, who was set to take over leadership of Gateway, resigned from his father’s church.\n\nAfter Chalk made his announcement at Cross Timbers Sunday, the church’s founding pastor, Toby Slough, took the stage.\n\nHe addressed the congregation and encouraged them to “feel their feelings,” whether that be anger, disappointment, or sadness. He also asked them to stick with the church.\n\n“As you process through the reality of this day, in the context of quite honestly what we’re hearing on the news . . . my prayer is that we would let unchanging truth be our guiding light, even when it doesn’t feel that way,” Chalk said while tearing up.\n\nHe noted church elders’ quick response time to learning about Anthony’s actions. He said that within a month of learning this, the elders made their decision about Anthony’s resignation.\n\nHe also thanked the individuals who spoke up and shared about Anthony.\n\n“I am so grateful for the individuals who had the courage to speak to our elders about some challenges that they had had, with grace and integrity,” he said. “I know that wasn’t easy.”\n\nHe added, “I’m grateful the Lord is near to the brokenhearted."
