        "text": "Any suggestions for a new middle name? Finding it a difficult 'fit' with our long surname. Needs to be a classic name too... probably single syllable, feel like I've done nothing but look at names since we found out we were expecting! xx\n\nLike the idea of two middle names but it's too much with a double barreled surname.\n\nGonna have another scope round for some single syllable names me thinks.\n\nThanks guys xx\n\nGlad you like it, I'm unsure, swaying a bit towards Oscar today for a baby Ozzy haha. Befuddled brain.\n\nI just can't find any 'proper' (non nickname) 1 syllable boys names for a middle name :(\n\nxx\n\nI'm pleased to hear someone else is considering Byron ... we are struggling to agree on boy's names and that's one of the few we both liked last time, but I started worrying it was too unusual / odd (probably just form other people's comments).\n\nSorry that's not much help for a middle name..I will give it some thought and see if I can come up with any suggestions!\n\nYou don't have to ;) addressing some of the comments above, thankyou!\n\nAlexander wouldn't work as it's his half his surname, I like a lot of A names but don't think they work for that reason. Same with B names and J names are a bit rudey haha.\n\nSome lovely names listed too but as his surname is sooooo long (7 syllables!) I think his middle name needs to be short\n\nxx\n\nYou don't have to ;) addressing some of the comments above, thankyou!\n\nAlexander wouldn't work as it's his half his surname, I like a lot of A names but don't think they work for that reason.
