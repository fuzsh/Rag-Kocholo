        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nNeal Town Stephenson (born October 31, 1959) is an American writer, known for his speculative fiction works, which have been variously categorized science fiction, historical fiction, maximalism, cyberpunk, and postcyberpunk. Stephenson explores areas such as mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, currency, and the history of science. He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired Magazine, and has worked part-time as an advisor for Blue Origin, a company (funded by Jeff Bezos) developing a manned sub-orbital launch system.\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n2 Literary works\n\n3 Style\n\n4 Bibliography\n\n4.1 Novels\n\n4.2 Short fiction\n\n4.3 Non-fiction\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\n[edit] Background\n\nBorn in Fort Meade, Maryland, Stephenson came from a family comprising engineers and hard scientists he dubs \"propeller heads\". His father is a professor of electrical engineering whose father was a physics professor; his mother worked in a biochemistry laboratory, while her father was a biochemistry professor. Stephenson's family moved to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in 1960 and then to Ames, Iowa in 1966 where he graduated from Ames High School in 1977. Stephenson furthered his studies at Boston University. He first specialized in physics, then switched to geography after he found that it would allow him to spend more time on the university mainframe. He graduated in 1981 with a B.A. in Geography and a minor in physics. Since 1984, Stephenson has lived mostly in the Pacific Northwest and currently resides in Seattle with his family.\n\n[edit] Literary works\n\nHis first novel, The Big U, was published in 1984. The Big U received very little attention when it first came out, and was subsequently out of print until Stephenson allowed it to be reprinted in 2001. After The Big U, Stephenson published the eco-thriller Zodiac before rising to prominence in the early 1990s with the novel Snow Crash (1992), which fuses memetics, computer viruses, and other high-tech themes with Sumerian mythology, along with an analysis of the differences between ideologies such as libertarianism, laissez-faire capitalism, and communism. Averaging one novel every four years, he has written several subsequent novels:\n\nThe Diamond Age: or A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer (1995), which deals with a future with extensive nanotechnology and dynabooks. The SciFi Channel and George Clooney have discussed producing a miniseries adaptation of The Diamond Age, to be penned by Stephenson, however this seems to be in development hell.[1]\n\nCryptonomicon (1999), a novel concerned with concepts ranging from computing and Alan Turing's research into codebreaking and cryptography during the Second World War at Bletchley Park, to a modern attempt to set up a data haven. It has subsequently been reissued in three separate volumes in some countries, including in French and Spanish translations.\n\nThe Baroque Cycle is a series of historical novels and is in some respects a prequel to Cryptonomicon. It was originally published in three volumes but has subsequently been republished as eight separate books:\n\nQuicksilver (2003) (containing the books Quicksilver, King of the Vagabonds, and Odalisque);\n\nThe Confusion (2004) (containing the books Bonanza and Juncto);\n\nThe System of the World (2004) (containing the books Solomon's Gold, Currency, and System of the World).\n\nHis most recent novel, Anathem, a work of speculative fiction set in a far-future Earth-like world, was released on September 9, 2008.[2]\n\nStephenson has also written non fiction. In The Beginning Was The Command Line, an essay on operating systems and specifically the history of Linux from both a cultural and technical viewpoint was published in book form in 1999. Various other essays have been published in magazines such as Wired.\n\nWith the 2003 publication of Quicksilver, Stephenson debuted The Metaweb (main page as partially preserved in the Wayback Machine at 5 April 2006), a wiki (using the same software as Wikipedia) annotating the ideas and historical period explored in the novel. As of April 25, 2007 the metaweb.com site is no longer an active wiki.\n\n[edit] Style\n\nThe science fiction approach doesn't mean it's always about the future; it's an awareness that this is different.\n\nâNeal Stephenson, September 1999[3]\n\nStephenson, at least in his earlier novels, deals heavily in pop culture-laden metaphors and imagery, and in quick, hip dialogue, as well as in extended narrative monologues. The tone of his books is generally more irreverent and less self-serious than that of previous cyberpunk novels, notably those of William Gibson.\n\nStephenson's books tend to have elaborate, inventive plots drawing on numerous technological and sociological ideas at the same time. This distinguishes him from other mainstream science fiction authors who tend to focus on a few technological or social changes in isolation from others. The discursive nature of his writing, together with significant plot and character complexity and an abundance of detail suggests a baroque writing style, which Stephenson brought fully to bear in the three-volume Baroque Cycle.[4] His book The Diamond Age follows a simpler plot, but features \"neo-Victorian\" characters and employs Victorian-era literary conceits. In keeping with the baroque style, Stephenson's books have become longer as he has gained recognition. (At least one printing of Cryptonomicon is well over one thousand pages long and the novel contains various digressions, including a lengthy erotic story about antique furniture and stockings.)\n\n[edit] Bibliography\n\n[edit] Novels\n\nThe Big U (1984)\n\nZodiac (1988)\n\nSnow Crash (1992) -- Clarke and British Science Fiction Awards nominee, 1994 [5]\n\nInterface (1994) as Stephen Bury with J.
