        "text": "Date: Sunday, October 27th | Time: 6 PM | Location: Dog-Eared Books\n\nIt is with great excitement and anticipation that we welcome Neal Stephenson, beloved Ames-born author of more than one modern Sci-Fi classic, to Dog-Eared Books for the release of his latest novel, Polostan. Come join us this October to celebrate Neal and his book, drink a curated cocktail, and hear all the behind-the-scenes info about the first novel in an enthralling new series.\n\nThe Book: The first installment in Neal Stephensonâ€™s Bomb Light cycle, Polostan follows the early life of the enigmatic Dawn Rae Bjornberg. Born in the American West to a clan of cowboy anarchists, Dawn is raised in Leningrad after the Russian Revolution by her Russian father, a party line Leninist who re-christens her Aurora. She spends her early years in Russia but then grows up as a teenager in Montana, before being drawn into gunrunning and revolution in the streets of Washington, D.C., during the depths of the Great Depression. When a surprising revelation about her past puts her in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities, Dawn returns to Russia, where she is groomed as a spy by the organization that later becomes the KGB.\n\nSet against the turbulent decades of the early twentieth century, Polostan is an inventive, richly detailed, and deeply entertaining historical epic, and the start of a captivating new series from Neal Stephenson."
