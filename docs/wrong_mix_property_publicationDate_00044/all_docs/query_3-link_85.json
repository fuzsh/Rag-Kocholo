        "text": "I was so excited while I was reading SeveNeves, I kept bugging my wife. I’d tell her how great the story was and how I had to keep reading it just a little bit longer. But then I hit Part 3.\n\nI’m going to review this book as if it is two books. If you read Seveneves (Part 1 & 2), and then stop at that point, it is one of the best Science-Fiction disaster books you will ever read. It takes place in the near future. The events are realistic and believable. The story is done at the end of Part 2. The book could end right there and you wouldn’t feel like you were missing anything. You care about the characters, because they are complete, real people. You are happy with the story. It is complex, detailed, and satisfying. All the elements are there. It is a very fast read, because you won’t be able to put it down. You may as well decide that you won’t do anything else until you finish it. Just stop at the end of Part 2, and come back a week or two later and read the sequel, Seveneves (Part 3). So lets treat this book as if it was two separate books. We will all agree that Seveneves (Part 1 & 2) is a great book. But what about the other book?\n\nNow if you are ready for Seveneves (Part 3), prepare yourself, Part 3 takes place 5000 years later. You really don’t care about the characters, because they are caricatures. The seven eves have borne seven human races that have gone on over those 5000 years to become nearly seven different human sub-species. They never had any interbreeding during the time when they were all confined together. Not very realistic. Maybe Part 3 is not a realistic Science Fiction story. Maybe it is supposed to be taken as an allegory, a comment on the human condition. That could be what Mr. Stephenson had in mind. That wasn’t what I was looking for. I wanted more of the fabulous, detailed, tightly written, engaging story we got in Seveneves, Part 1 & 2.\n\nI give Seveneves (Part 1 & 2) 5 Stars out of 5, and Two Big Thumbs Up! It is a great book! If you like a near future, hard science story, with fully formed characters, and a complex, detailed, exciting plot, then you will love this book. Read it in spite of Part 3. I may have to go back and read Part 3 in a few months. Maybe I will appreciate it more then. I hope that you are able to understand what I was missing when you read Seveneves.\n\nI received a Digital Review Copy of this book from the publisher.\n\nBook Description"
