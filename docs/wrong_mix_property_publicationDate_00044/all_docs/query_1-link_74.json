        "text": "Neal Stephenson, a widely renowned speculative fiction writer, is the man behind the term “metaverse” that we all know of and use today. He coined it in his 1992 novel ‘Snow Crash’ which garnered a lot of critical acclaim that he continues to bolster by his work today. He has produced several pieces of work that have been awarded time and time again and he has also produced work worthy of being recognized as a New York Times No. 1 Bestseller. Neal offers insight to promising technology enthusiasts via his speeches at a myriad of events that he can be booked for.\n\nThough Neal’s degrees in geography and physics were an amazing feat in themselves, he ultimately recognized his penchant and flair for writing speculative writing and began his journey in this sphere in 1984. From there he kept adding to his repertoire and today has nearly 15 books to his name, including titles like ‘Quicksilver’, ‘System of the World’, ‘Reamde’, ‘The Mongoliad’, ‘Fall or, Dodge in Hell’, ‘The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O’ and ‘Sevenes’. His most recent novel, published in 2021, ‘Terminator Shock’ is one that talks about solar geoengineering and climate fiction.\n\nNeal is a 2-time recipient of the Hugo Award, has received the SF Locus Award 5 times and has also received the British Science Fiction Association Award. He has also trodden beyond the world of fiction and into that of non-fiction content through the articles he has written for WIRED. Beyond his literary achievements, Neal has been a part of Technical Staff of Blue Origin which is a company owned by Jeff Bezos."
