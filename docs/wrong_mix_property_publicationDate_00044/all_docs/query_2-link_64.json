        "text": "Neal Town Stephenson (born October 31, 1959) is an American writer and game designer known for his works of speculative fiction.\n\nHis novels have been variously categorized as science fiction, historical fiction, cyberpunk, and \"postcyberpunk.\" Other labels, such as \"baroque,\" often appear.\n\nStephenson explores subjects such as mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, currency, and the history of science. He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired.\n\nHe has worked part-time as an advisor for Blue Origin, a company (funded by Jeff Bezos) developing a manned sub-orbital launch system, and is also a cofounder of Subutai Corporation, whose first offering is the interactive fiction project The Mongoliad. He has also written novels with his uncle, George Jewsbury (\"J. Frederick George\"), under the collective pseudonym Stephen Bury."
