VJ Books Presents Author Neal Stephenson!

American writer Neal Stephenson was born October 31, 1959 in Maryland. He came from a family of engineers and scientists. Stephenson studied at Boston University, first specializing in physics, then switching to geography after he found that it would allow him to spend more time on the university mainframe. He graduated in 1981 with a B.A. in geography and a minor in physics.

Stephenson is best known for his works of speculative fiction. His work explores subjects such as mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, currency, and the history of science. He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired.

Stephenson has lived mostly in the Pacific Northwest and currently resides in Seattle with his family
