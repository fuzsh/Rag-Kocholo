The Big U (1984) was a satirical take on life at American Megaversity, a vast, bland and alienating research university beset by chaotic riots.

Zodiac (1988), was a thriller following the exploits of a radical environmentalist protagonist in his struggle against corporate polluters.

Snow Crash (1992), Stephenson's breakthrough, a novel in the late cyberpunk or post-cyberpunk tradition fusing memetics, computer viruses, and other high-tech themes with Sumerian mythology, along with a sociological extrapolation of laissez-faire capitalism and collectivism.

Interface (1994), a political thriller written with his uncle under the pen name Stephen Bury.

The Diamond Age: or A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer (1995), deals with a future with extensive nanotechnology and dynabooks.

Quicksilver (2003)

The Confusion (2004)

The System of the World (2004)

Anathem (2008), a very long and detailed work set in an Earthlike world, dealing with metaphysics, and refers heavily to Ancient Greek philosophy, while at the same time being a complex commentary on the insubstantiality of today's contemporary society.

Reamde (2011), a thriller set in the present with a plot that involves a medley of game developers, Chinese cyber-criminals, Russian mafia, and other stranger inhabitants of the new global village.

Stephenson is also known for having written the non-fiction essay In the Beginningâ€¦ Was the Command Line (1999), a commentary on why the proprietary operating systems business is unlikely to remain profitable in the future because of competition from free software.
