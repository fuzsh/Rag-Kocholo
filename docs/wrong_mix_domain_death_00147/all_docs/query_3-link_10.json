        "text": "(LOS ANGELES, January 23rd, 2005, 6 p.m.) -- Johnny Carson, the \"Tonight Show\" host who served America a smooth nightcap of celebrity banter, droll comedy and heartland charm for 30 years, died Sunday. He was 79.\n\n\"Mr. Carson passed away peacefully early Sunday morning,\" his nephew, Jeff Sotzing, told The Associated Press. \"He was surrounded by his family, whose loss will be immeasurable.\"\n\nHe did not provide further details, but NBC said Carson died of emphysema at his Malibu home.\n\nThe boyish-looking Nebraska native with the disarming grin, who survived every attempt to topple him from his late-night talk show throne, was a star who managed never to distance himself from his audience.\n\nHis wealth, the adoration of his guests -- particularly the many young comics whose careers he launched -- the wry tales of multiple divorces: Carson's air of modesty made it all serve to enhance his bedtime intimacy with viewers.\n\n\"Heeeeere's Johnny!\" was the booming announcement from sidekick Ed McMahon that ushered Carson out to the stage. Then the formula: the topical monologue, the guests, the broadly played skits such as \"Carnac the Magnificent.\"\n\nBut America never tired of him; Carson went out on top when he retired in May 1992. In his final show, he told his audience: \"And so it has come to this. I am one of the lucky people in the world.\n\nI found something that I always wanted to do and I have enjoyed every single minute of it.\"\n\nHis personal life could not match the perfection of his career.\n\nCarson was married four times, divorced three. In 1991, one of his three sons, 39-year-old Ricky, was killed in a car accident.\n\nNearly all of Carson's professional life was spent in television, from his postwar start at Nebraska stations in the late 1940s to his three decades with NBC's \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\"\n\nCarson choose to let \"Tonight\" stand as his career zenith and his finale, withdrawing into a quiet retirement that suited his private nature and refusing involvement in other show business projects.\n\nIn 1993, he explained his absence from the limelight.\n\n\"I have an ego like anybody else,\" Carson told The Washington Post, \"but I don't need to be stoked by going before the public all the time.\"\n\nHe was open to finding the right follow-up to \"Tonight,\" he told friends. But his longtime producer, Fred de Cordova, said Carson didn't feel pressured -- he could look back on his TV success and say \"I did it.\"\n\n\"And that makes sense. He is one of a kind, was one of a kind,\" de Cordova said in 1995. \"I don't think there's any reason for him to try something different.\"\n\nCarson spent his retirement years sailing, traveling and socializing with a few close friends including media mogul Barry Diller and NBC executive Bob Wright. He simply refused to be wooed back on stage.\n\n\"I just let the work speak for itself,\" he told Esquire magazine in 2002 in a rare interview.\n\nCarson did find an outlet for his creativity: He wrote short humor pieces for The New Yorker magazine, including \"Recently Discovered Childhood Letters to Santa,\" which purported to give the youthful wish lists of William Buckley, Don Rickles and others.\n\nCarson made his debut as \"Tonight\" host in October 1962 and quickly won over audiences. He even made headlines with such clever ploys as the 1969 on-show marriage of eccentric singer Tiny Tim to Miss Vicki, which won the show its biggest-ever ratings.\n\nThe wedding and other noteworthy moments from the show were collected into a yearly \"Tonight\" anniversary special.\n\nIn 1972, \"Tonight\" moved from New York to Burbank. Growing respect for Carson's consistency and staying power, along with four consecutive Emmy Awards, came his way in the late 1970s.\n\nHis quickness and his ability to handle an audience were impressive. When his jokes missed their target, the smooth Carson won over a groaning studio audience with a clever look or sly, self-deprecating remark.\n\nPolitics provided monologue fodder for him as he skewered lawmakers of every stripe, mirroring the mood of voters. His Watergate jabs at President Nixon were seen as cementing Nixon's fall from office in 1974.\n\nHe made presidential history again in July 1988 when he had then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton on his show a few days after Clinton came under widespread ridicule for a boring speech at the Democratic National Convention. Clinton traded quips with Carson and played \"Summertime\" on the saxophone in what was hailed as a stunning comeback.\n\nCompeting networks tried a variety of formats and hosts to challenge Carson, but never managed to best \"Tonight.\"\n\nThere was the occasional battle with NBC: In 1967, for instance, Carson walked out for several weeks until the network managed to lure him back with a contract that reportedly gave him $1 million-plus yearly.\n\nIn 1980, after more walkout threats, the show was scaled back from 90 minutes to an hour. Carson also eased his schedule by cutting back on his work days; a number of substitute hosts filled in, including Joan Rivers, Jerry Lewis and Jay Leno, Carson's eventual successor.\n\nRivers was one of the countless comedians whose careers took off after they were on Carson's show. After she rocked the audience with her jokes in that 1965 appearance, he remarked, \"God, you're funny. You're going to be a star.\"\n\n\"If Johnny hadn't made the choice to put me on his show, I might still be in Greenwich Village as the oldest living undiscovered female comic,\" she recalled in an Associated Press interview 20 years later. She tried her own talk show in 1986, quickly becoming one of the many challengers who could not budge Carson.\n\nIn the '80s, Carson was reportedly the highest-paid performer in television history with a $5 million \"Tonight\" show salary alone.\n\nHis Carson Productions created and sold pilots to NBC, including \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.\" Carson himself made occasional cameo appearances on other TV series.\n\nHe also performed in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., and was host of the Academy Awards five times in the '70s and '80s.\n\nCarson's graceful exit from \"Tonight\" did not avoid a messy, bitter tug-of-war between Leno and fellow comedian David Letterman to take over his throne. Leno took over on May 25, 1992, becoming the fourth man to hold the job after Steve Allen, Jack Paar and Carson. Letterman landed on rival CBS.\n\nBorn in Corning, Iowa, and raised in nearby Norfolk, Neb., Carson started his show business career at age 14 as the magician \"The Great Carsoni.\"\n\nAfter World War II service in the Navy, he took a series of jobs in local radio and TV in Nebraska before starting at KNXT-TV in Los Angeles in 1950.\n\nThere he started a sketch comedy show, \"Carson's Cellar,\" which ran from 1951-53 and attracted attention from Hollywood. A staff writing job for \"The Red Skelton Show\" followed.\n\nThe program provided Carson with a lucky break: When Skelton was injured backstage, Carson took the comedian's place in front of the cameras.\n\nProducers tried to find the right program for the up-and-coming comic, trying him out as host of the quiz show \"Earn Your Vacation\" (1954), the variety show \"The Johnny Carson Show\" (1955-56), the game show \"Who Do You Trust?\" (1957-62).\n\nA few acting roles came Carson's way, including one on \"Playhouse 90\" in 1957, and he did a pilot in 1960 for a prime-time series, \"Johnny Come Lately,\" that never made it onto a network schedule.\n\nIn 1958, Carson sat in for \"Tonight Show\" host Paar. When Paar left the show four years later, Carson was NBC's choice as his replacement.\n\nAfter his retirement, Carson took on the role of Malibu-based retiree with apparent ease. An avid tennis fan, he was still playing a vigorous game in his 70s.\n\nHe and his wife, Alexis, traveled frequently. The pair met on the Malibu beach in the early 1980s; he was 61 when they married in June 1987, she was in her 30s.\n\nCarson's first wife was his childhood sweetheart, Jody, the mother of his three sons. They married in 1949 and split in 1963.\n\nHe married Joanne Copeland Carson that same year, but divorced nine years later. His third marriage, to Joanna Holland Carson, took place in 1972. They divorced in 1985.\n\nOn the occasion of Carson's 70th birthday, former \"Tonight\" bandleader Doc Severinsen, who toured with musicians from the show, said he was constantly reminded of Carson's enduring popularity.\n\n\"Every place we go people ask 'How is he? Where is he? What is he doing? Tell him how much we miss him.' It doesn't surprise me,\" Severinsen said.\n\nCarson won a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 1992, with the first President Bush saying, \"With decency and style he's made America laugh and think.\" In 1993, he was celebrated by the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors for career achievement.\n\nHis nephew said there will be no memorial service."
