        "text": "Before achieving fame as the renowned host of late-night television, Johnny Carson was a young man who dutifully responded to his country’s call. His early years were defined by his service in the US Army Air Force from 1943 to 1945. This period of his life served as the cornerstone for his exceptional Hollywood career, where he emerged as the unmatched presenter of “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” Through his military service, Carson not only made a lasting impact on the silver screen but also within the hearts of his fellow servicemen.\n\nJohnny Carson’s Early Years\n\nBorn on October 23, 1925, in Corning, Iowa, Johnny Carson spent his formative years in the heart of the Midwest. Carson’s family relocated to Norfolk, Nebraska, where he enrolled in Norfolk High School. During his academic years, he showcased his comedic prowess by participating in school plays and honing his magic skills.\n\nAt the age of 12, during a visit to a friend’s house in Nebraska, he stumbled upon a magic book that captivated his interest. Carson eagerly ordered a magic kit through the mail, and with his mother’s assistance in crafting a cape, he began performing magic shows within his local community. His debut took place at the Kiwanis Club, and he later became a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Carson’s innate charm and quick wit became apparent to those who had the pleasure of witnessing his early performances.\n\nJohnny Carson Enlisted in the U.S. Navy during WW2\n\nIn 1943, as World War II raged on, Johnny Carson, at the age of 18, answered the call of duty and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He joined a specialized program designed to train officers for the war effort. Completing his training at Columbia University, he earned the rank of ensign before the war’s end. Assigned to the USS Pennsylvania, a battleship engaged in significant Pacific theater battles, Carson’s responsibilities included decoding encrypted enemy radio communications.\n\nDespite the challenges of wartime, Carson’s humor and wit remained intact. He frequently entertained his fellow servicemen with impromptu comedy sketches and magic tricks, offering a brief escape from the harsh realities of war.\n\nJohnny Carson’s High Point of Military Career\n\nJohnny Carson often remembered a significant moment in his military service. While serving in the Navy, he had a chance to perform a magic trick for Navy Secretary James Forrestal. Though the specifics of the trick remain largely undocumented, this incident became a significant anecdote in Carson’s life. It showcased his ability to captivate and amuse people, even influential figures like the Navy Secretary.\n\nAccording to Carson’s biography, this encounter solidified his dream of becoming an entertainer. When Forrestal inquired if Carson intended to stay in the Navy after the war, Carson expressed his desire to pursue magic as a career. Forrestal was intrigued and asked Carson to demonstrate his card trick skills.\n\nCarson’s magic brought delight to Forrestal, leaving a lasting impression on the young serviceman. Recognizing that he could entertain someone as stern as Forrestal, Carson became resolute in sharing his unique blend of magic and humor with audiences.\n\nJohnny Carson is An Entertainment Business Kingmaker\n\nAfter his military service in World War II, Johnny Carson’s career spanned several decades, making him one of the most influential figures in television and entertainment.\n\nIn 1949 Carson finished the University of Nebraska, where he studied radio and speech with the intention of pursuing a career in broadcasting. He later transitioned to television, working at various local stations.
