        "text": "It was a meeting of the late-night-hosting minds Wednesday, as Arsenio Hall appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. Hall talked about The Arsenio Hall Show, which originally ran from 1989 to 1994. Despite airing at the same time as Johnny Carson’s The Tonight Show, Hall actually credits the legendary late-night host with helping him succeed.\n\n“Sometimes Johnny would come across somebody he thought was really great, but he didn't discover talent,” said Hall. “Me, being the young guy, I would put on a new Mariah Carey or Will Smith. They would give me names. Like they gave me Usher Raymond once, because I guess Ed knew him from Star Search.”\n\nCarson was apparently a big fan of Hall. Even though their shows aired at the same time, they catered to different audiences. This led to more support and less competition.\n\n“To know that not only he doesn't hate me, but he tries to help me because the paths were so divided, so distinctly divided,” said Hall. “You know, you knew who a Johnny guest was, and you knew who an Arsenio guest was.”\n\nHall was on The Late Show to promote Coming 2 America, which is the long-awaited sequel to the '80s classic Coming to America. The new film opens March 5.\n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on CBS.\n\nWatch as Ricki Lake gushes over new fiancé and shares steamy proposal details:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nPat Sajak called out for mocking 'Wheel of Fortune' contestant's speech impediment\n\nDylan Farrow describes disturbing alleged behavior by Woody Allen in new HBO doc: 'He was always hunting me'\n\n'Never judge a book by its cover': Joke contestants flip the script on 'American Idol'"
