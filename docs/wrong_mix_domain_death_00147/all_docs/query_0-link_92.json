        "text": "If you can think of a Valley arts organization, big or small, odds are it’s part of the CALA Festival.\n\nA two-month initiative celebrating the arts and culture of Latinos and people of the Americas, the inaugural festival includes more than 40 creative groups staging dozens of performances, exhibits, festivals and showcases across the Valley between Sept. 14 and Nov. 16.\n\nFrom a pops concert by the Phoenix Symphony and a Dia de los Muertos exhibit at Xico in Chandler to a U.S. debut exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum and a Spanish-to-English translated play at Teatro Bravo, the CALA offerings are as different as the organizations themselves.\n\n“The festival will show the richness of cultural diversity, in this case Latino,” said Myra Millinger, treasurer of Celebracion Artistica de las Americas Alliance, the non-profit behind the festival.\n\n“I’m not Latino, and neither is (fellow board member) Grady Gammage Jr. What we’re really saying with this festival is that, through arts and culture, bridges can be built.”\n\nAt the heart of the festival is a desire to change the conversation about Latinos, Millinger said. It is hoped the works will help relieve some of the political tension building in the state and help transform Arizona’s image as a desert to that of a culturally diverse oasis.\n\nThe festival had been in the works for years – even before SB 1070 catapulted Arizona’s debate over illegal immigration onto the national stage – as an idea of the now-defunct Metro Phoenix Partnership for Arts and Culture.\n\nThe CALA Alliance was founded last year, with businessman Ruben Alvarez as president.\n\nAccording to a PEW Hispanic Center report, Arizona has the fifth-highest Latino population in the country with more than 2 million.\n\nWith so many CALA Festival offerings, here are 10 not-to-miss events:\n\nArtists at ALAC\n\nThe Arizona Latino Arts and Cultural Center, an ambitious and dedicated downtown Phoenix gallery and events space, will host several indigenous Mexican artists, including Juan Chawuk, a Tojolobal Maya from Chiapas who creates allegorical paintings dealing with community and nature, and Jacobo Angeles, a Oaxacan known for his folk wood carvings of animals painted with intricate motifs.\n\nDetails: Through Nov. 16. Arizona Latino Arts and Cultural Center, 147 E. Adams St., Phoenix. Free. 602-254-9817, alacaz.org.\n\n‘Mixing It Up: Building an Identity’\n\nFeaturing works by more than 40 artists, this exhibit examines how the relationship between the United States and Mexican cultures, social mores and politics influence the works of Chicano and Mexican-American artists. Recurring themes include personal and national identity, pop culture, family, community, labor and the border. A collaboration between the Tempe Center for the Arts and the Hispanic Research Center at Arizona State University. Grand opening is from 7 to 9 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 17..\n\nDetails: Sept. 17- Jan. 28. 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays. Tempe Center for the Arts, 700 W.
