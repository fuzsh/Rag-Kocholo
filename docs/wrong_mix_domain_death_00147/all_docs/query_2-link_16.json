        "text": "(Hope this hasn't been posted already)\n\n(Note: Paradise Valley n.e. area of Phoenix)\n\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0124carsonlocal24.html\n\nCarson kept Valley visits private\n\nKathy Shayna Shocket - The Arizona Republic - Jan. 24, 2005 12:00 AM\n\nJohnny Carson will be remembered as an extremely private person. Few had the chance to know\n\nhim socially off camera. But Herman Chanen of Phoenix was one.\n\nThe Phoenix businessman was often invited with his wife to the star's Bel Air, Calif., home\n\nin the 1980s for cocktails or a private dinner.\n\n\"He had a room in the house where he played his drums,\" said Chanen, who had the rare opportunity\n\nto hear Carson informally pound away. \"Playing the drums was a great way for him to relax.\"\n\nChanen and other noted Valley residents recalled personal anecdotes about the television legend\n\nafter he died Sunday at 79.\n\nWhen Carson came to the Valley, he frequently called Chanen, whom he met through mutual friends.\n\nThe chairman and CEO of Chanen Construction Co. also became very close to the talk-show\n\ngiant's parents, Kit and Ruth Carson.\n\nMost people never knew that Kit and Ruth Carson quietly moved to Paradise Valley from Nebraska\n\nin the '80s. And Carson discreetly came to the Valley to see them. Chanen would sometimes give\n\nhim a lift from Scottsdale Municipal Airport to their home. It wasn't a business relationship,\n\nbut a personal friendship.\n\n\"He sought privacy all the time,\" Chanen said. \"My wife at that time, Lois, and I went to the\n\nSands in Las Vegas on several occasions to have dinner with Johnny and his (former) wife,\n\nJoanna,\" he said. \"Once we had to eat in the hotel kitchen so he could have privacy.\"\n\nAnd Lois recalled that when Carson flew in to the Valley, he wanted to stay out of the limelight.\n\n\"Joanna would pack a big lunch and bring it in with them on their plane and we'd eat at\n\nJohnny's parents' house,\" she said.\n\nHerman Chanen spoke with Doc Severinsen's wife, Emily, on Sunday night. He could hear Doc in the\n\nbackground, busy on the phone as the news of Carson's death traveled across the country. From\n\nhis Santa Barbara home Severinsen, the Principal Pops conductor of the Phoenix Symphony, issued\n\na statement through his road manager, Bernadette Hillario.\n\n\"This is a huge loss for us. We are devastated. It was an honor and a privilege to know and work\n\nwith him,\" Severinsen said.\n\nCarson was so private that even some of his favorite guests, such as Joe Garagiola Sr., who was\n\non the Tonight Show many times, only knew him publicly. \"He wasn't rude, but we had a great time\n\non the air, he thanked you and then he was off,\" said the baseball player turned broadcaster.\n\n\"He was the Babe Ruth of the talk-show guys, \" Garagiola said. \"When you were a guest on his\n\nshow, he was genuinely interested. If you got on a roll, he would throw the questions out the\n\nwindow his people gave him. There were a couple times I would be waiting in the green room and\n\nnever really made the show because Johnny was on a roll with the guy before me. And when I was\n\nlucky, Johnny and I got on a roll and the next guy was bumped.\"\n\nGaragiola, of Scottsdale, said his career also benefited from being in that famous chair on the\n\nTonight Show. \"Whenever you did the Carson show it was as if all America was watching you,\n\neverybody would know you,\" he said. \"I still have people coming up to me, telling me they\n\nenjoyed me on the show telling my Yogi (Berra) stories.\"\n\nGaragiola was even asked to host the show when Carson was on vacation. Carson trusted him\n\nenough to have him host on a night the Beatles were on.\n\nHugh Downs of Paradise Valley substituted for Carson five times during the first year and\n\na half of the Tonight Show. In fact, Downs was the sidekick and substitute host for the\n\nJack Paar show from July 1957 through September 1962. When Jack Paar left, Downs says he\n\nthought he was being considered for Paar's replacement, but NBC asked him to host the\n\nToday show, a position he held for almost a decade. \"I asked them who would replace Jack Paar\n\nand they told me Johnny Carson would be Jack Paar's replacement.\n\n\"Johnny's mark of greatness was that he put the spotlight on the guest,\" said Downs, who was\n\nfriendly with Carson before the Tonight Show. \"I knew him when he was hosting a daytime show\n\ncalled Who Do You Trust?,\" Downs said."
