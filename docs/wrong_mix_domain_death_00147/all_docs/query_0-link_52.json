        "text": "Driving into the Future: The Rise of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nMovies have the power to be insightful, aspirational, and provide an escape from the stresses of every day life. It's when technology bridges the gap between fiction and reality, that movie magic becomes innovation.\n\nWho could forget the Audi RSQ from I Robot, the Lexus 2054 from Minority Report and the quirky automated Johnny Cab from Total Recall. But just how close are we to having autonomous cars as part of our daily lives.\n\nThe Current State Of Technology\n\nIn order for these cars to become mainstream, breakthroughs in the following areas are needed.\n\nSensors: Self-driving cars rely on a suite of sensors like cameras, lidar (which uses lasers to create 3D maps), and radar to get a complete picture of the road.\n\nSoftware: This is the brain of the operation! It processes the sensor data to understand what's happening around the car and make decisions about speed, steering, and braking.\n\nMapping: Self-driving cars also rely on detailed maps to understand road layouts, traffic signs, and possible obstacles.\n\nIt is true that well known pioneers of autonomous technology like Tesla and Waymo: a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's Parent Company) have vehicles that are what is called Level 3 Automation. These cars can perform driving tasks but require driver interaction\n\nHowever, it's also true that these companies will have to win over a skeptical and cautious consumer base. Part of that process is to roll out Level 4 testing which will use controlled environments, and favorable conditions found in the Sun Belt states.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\nBeyond personal transportation, autonomous vehicles are poised to disrupt entire industries. Long-haul trucking could be revolutionized by self-driving trucks that tirelessly navigate highways, delivering goods more efficiently and reducing reliance on a strained workforce.\n\nImagine a future where hailing a ride is as effortless as searching the web - \"Robo-taxis\" summoned by a tap on your phone, offering a safe and convenient alternative to traditional taxis or even owning a car altogether. The potential impact of autonomous vehicles extends far beyond the road, promising to reshape how we move goods and ourselves in the years to come.\n\nUntil The Future Arrives\n\nWhile there's no autonomous cars that we can program to automatically visit our dealership (just yet!), our extensive inventory is sure to impress you. So, whether you're looking for a test drive in the traditional way or hoping to hail a robo-taxi in the future, we'll be here to meet your transportation needs.\n\n.\n\nIt's That Time of Year\n\nSchools are out, and that means families everywhere are gearing up for their next big adventure. With modern tools like GPS and travel apps, planning a road trip has never been easier. But not that long ago, just getting from one part of the country to another was not only dangerous, but almost unheard of for leisure traveling!.\n\nYou Thought Your Trip Was Tough\n\nIn 1903, H. Nelson Jackson and Sewall K. Crocker took on the challenge of driving across the United States in a car. They faced rough roads, breakdowns, and navigational hiccups. Their journey showed everyone that road trips were possible and sparked a love for the open road. It was many years later that road conditions and infrastructure developed to the point of making them practical.\n\nAAA To The Rescue\n\nWhile AAA is synonymous with roadside assistance today, it was their TripTiks, introduced in 1937, that revolutionized road trips. These custom-made maps charted detailed routes, pinpointed interesting attractions, and even offered safety advice. For families venturing out on vacation, TripTiks became an essential tool, ensuring they knew exactly where to go and what hidden gems awaited them along the way.\n\nIn addition to TripTiks, the AAA TourBook, was the go to guide for hotels, motels, restaurants, and gas stations across various regions. These books were invaluable, providing not only addresses and phone numbers but also reviews, price ranges, and amenities. However, the information could quickly become outdated, leading to occasional surprises.\n\nNavigating to these locations was another challenge. Families had to plot their routes on paper maps, which required careful attention to detail and a good sense of direction. Map reading became a crucial skill, and having a designated navigator in the car was often essential.\n\nDespite meticulous planning, it wasn't uncommon for families to face unexpected detours or arrive at their destinations only to find that a hotel was fully booked or a gas station was closed. These situations require flexibility and quick thinking. Sometimes, it meant driving further down the road to find the next available option or asking locals for recommendations.\n\nRoad Trip Evolution: From Maps to Magic\n\nThe lack of real-time information made these trips feel more adventurous but also more stressful. thankfully, the introduction of GPS ushered in a new era, replacing the days of bulky maps and dog-eared travel guides with the convenience of digital tools that could guide us to the nearest station, and beyond. GPS navigation replaced wrong turns with turn-by-turn guidance and real-time traffic updates, making getting lost a distant memory. Trips became efficient, stress-free, and even safer.\n\nSmartphones took it a step further. Apps like Google Maps and TripAdvisor provide everything from gas stations to attractions at your fingertips. Families can now be spontaneous, with real-time reviews helping them find the best places to eat, sleep, and explore – making every adventure more enjoyable.\n\nChoosing the Right Car for Your Family Vacation\n\nWhile it’s fun to look into the past to see how far we’ve come, choosing the right car for your family vacation is just as important today. The right vehicle can make all the difference in ensuring a comfortable, enjoyable, and stress-free journey for everyone. Here are some key considerations when selecting the perfect car for your next family adventure:\n\nSpace and Comfort\n\nOne of the most important factors is ensuring that there is enough space for both passengers and luggage. Long road trips require ample room to stretch out and relax. Look for vehicles with spacious interiors, adjustable seating, and plenty of cargo space. Features like captain's chairs, third-row seating, and foldable seats can provide added flexibility and comfort.\n\nAdvanced Safety Features\n\nSafety is paramount, especially when traveling with family. Modern cars come equipped with advanced safety features that can significantly enhance your peace of mind. Look for vehicles with adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, and automatic emergency braking. These features can help prevent accidents and ensure a safer driving experience.\n\nEntertainment Options\n\nKeeping everyone entertained during long drives is essential. Modern vehicles offer a variety of entertainment options to keep passengers occupied. Look for cars with built-in entertainment systems, such as DVD or Blu-ray players, rear-seat screens, and connectivity options for streaming devices. Wi-Fi hotspots and multiple USB ports can also be a lifesaver for keeping devices charged and connected.\n\nFuel Efficiency and Reliability\n\nFuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrids and electric cars, are excellent choices for long road trips. They offer better mileage, which means fewer stops for gas and more savings. Additionally, environmentally friendly options help reduce your carbon footprint. Regular maintenance is also crucial to ensure your vehicle is in top condition and ready for any adventure. Make sure to check tire pressure, oil levels, and other essential fluids before hitting the road.\n\nDon't Let Your Current Car Be the Bump in Your Next Road Trip!\n\nReady to create lasting memories with your family? Ditch the outdated navigation methods and cramped quarters. It's time to find the perfect car for your next adventure! Your dream vacation awaits – make sure your car is ready to join the journey! Stop by or call us today. Our experts are here to assist you along the way.\n\n.\n\nThe Best Ways To Keep Your Car Smelling Like New Your Car\n\nThe smell of a new car is one of the best things in the world. It's like getting a fresh start, every time you get in. But what can you do to make sure your car smells like new for as long as possible? Here are four tips that will help keep your car smelling great.\n\n1. Don't leave food in your car.\n\nThis one seems like a no-brainer, but it's worth repeating. Whenever you eat in your car, be sure to throw away any wrappers or leftover food. Otherwise, you're just inviting critters and bacteria to come in and make themselves at home.\n\n2. Vacuum the seats and carpets often\n\nEven if you don't eat in your car, dirt and dust can build up on the seats and carpets. Vacuuming regularly will help to remove these particles and keep your car smelling fresh.\n\n3. Use a fabric freshener to keep the upholstery smelling good\n\nThere are a variety of fabric fresheners on the market, both in spray and gel form. These can help to keep the upholstery in your car smelling pleasant.\n\n4. Spray a deodorizer in the car every week or so to keep it smelling fresh.\n\nThere are products that are designed to produce the new car smell. These can be found at most auto parts stores and can help keep your car smelling like new.\n\nThese are just the basics, but to really get rid of tough odors like smoke, it's going to take a bit more work. Deodorizers and fabric sprays may temporarily cover up smells, but they don’t actually remove them. If you’re looking for a more long-term solution, try an ozone generator.\n\nAn ozone generator can also be used to remove smoke odors from your car. They work by producing ozone molecules which attach to and break down the particles that cause odors. Ozone generators can be purchased online or at some home improvement stores.\n\nTop Car Accessories Every Owner Should Try\n\nAs a car owner, you are constantly looking for ways to improve your driving experience and make your car more comfortable and efficient. One way to do this is to invest in some top accessories that can help you get the most out of your car. Here are some of the best accessories every car owner should try:\n\nPortable Battery Charger & Jumper Box\n\nIf you are someone who is always on the go, a portable battery charger and jumper box is an absolute must. This handy accessory will allow you to charge your car battery on the go, so you never have to worry about being stranded with a dead battery. It is also great for jump starting your car if it ever dies while you are out and about.\n\nMirror Dash Cam\n\nA mirror dash cam is a great way to improve your safety while driving. It allows you to see what is happening behind you without taking your eyes off the road. There are models that will record both the front and rear view , so you can get a complete picture of what is going on around you. This can be invaluable evidence if you are ever in an accident. Unfortunately there are people who intentionally cause accidents so that they can make an insurance claim. A dashboard camera will help you prove that you were not at fault if this ever happens to you.\n\nCigarette Lighter Splitter\n\nIf you are constantly using your cigarette lighter to charge your phone or power other devices, then a cigarette lighter splitter is a must. This will allow you to plug in multiple devices at once without having to unplug something else. This can be really useful if you are using your navigation system and need to keep your phone charged at the same time.\n\nFrost Guard Windshield Mats\n\nIf you live in an area where it gets cold in the winter, then you know how frustrating it is to scrape ice off your windshield. Frost guard windshield mats are a great way to keep your windshield clear and prevent ice from building up. You can find mats that fit over your entire windshield or just the part that gets iced over. Some models come with mirror pockets so that you protect those from frost and snow build up\n\nOBD Scanner Tool\n\nAn OBD scanner tool is a must for any car owner. It allows you to read the diagnostic codes that are stored in your car’s computer. This can be really helpful if you are trying to figure out why your check engine light is on. You can also use it to clear codes and reset your engine light if it comes on unnecessarily. Look for ones that have a phone app so that you can read the codes on your phone.\n\nRemote Starter Phone App\n\nIf you have a remote starter, then you know how convenient it is to be able to start your car from inside your house. But what if you could start your car from anywhere? With a remote starter phone app, you can do just that. Many features include allowing others to use your vehicle as long as they have the phone app. This can be great for when your spouse or kids need to use the car but you are not home. Just make sure to set up some limits so that you don’t run up your car’s mileage too much.\n\nThese are only a few of the great accessories available to car owners. With so many options out there, it is easy to find something that will improve your driving experience. So don’t wait, start shopping for some new accessories today. Your car will thank you for it. Now that you have a list of wish list accessories it might be time to get a new car to put them in! After all, what better way to show off your new toys than in a stylish set of wheels?\n\nCheck out our latest models today and find the perfect one for you.\n\nWill Electric Cars Will Become Yesterday's News\n\nTechnology never stands still for long and, as anyone who's been paying attention to the automotive industry over the past few years will know, electric cars are very much the future. But what's next?\n\nOne area that is currently being explored is the possibility of flying cars. That's right, flying cars! While it may sound like something straight out of The Jetsons, there are a number of companies working on this incredible technology and it may not be as far-fetched as you might think.\n\nHere's a headline from a recently published article from Car and Driver\n\nHyundai Subsidiary Unveils Flying Car Concept That Could Fly U.S. Skies by 2028\n\n\"Hyundai is also investing heavily in the nascent industry, launching a U.S.-based subsidiary called Supernal last November to focus on the so-called \"Advanced Air Mobility market.” Now, Supernal has unveiled its eVTOL Vehicle Cabin concept at the Farnborough International Airshow in England, showing what the passenger compartment inside its upcoming intra-city air shuttle could look like.\"\n\nDon't Count On Getting Frequent Flier Miles Just Yet\n\nIn addition to the technical hurdles that need to be overcome, there are also a number of regulatory issues that need to be sorted out before flying cars become a reality. Just like most industries I'm sure that traditional airlines are not going to be too thrilled about the idea of having competition from flying cars.\n\nAnd then there's the question of whether or not people are actually going to want to fly in a car. I have to admit that the idea of getting stuck in traffic on the freeway is not all that appealing, but then again neither is being crammed into a metal tube with a bunch of strangers for hours on end.\n\nFlying cars would obviously have a lot of advantages over traditional ground-based vehicles. For one, they would be able to avoid traffic jams and get from A to B much quicker. They would also be able to park in a lot less space and, perhaps most importantly, they would be a lot of fun!\n\nReady To Trade Your Old Car For A Flying Car?\n\nYou may be excited about the prospect of buying a flying car but unfortunately we're out of stock.
