        "text": "“Heeeere’s Johnny!”\n\nThe indelible phrase, belted out by the late Ed McMahon, introduced late-night talk-show legend Johnny Carson to the nation night after night for decades.\n\nIt’s not a stretch to imagine that the spirit of Carson’s sidekick is, in some form, now present at the entrance of the Fullerton Museum Center, once again belting out his iconic introduction.\n\nThis time to visitors to a new exhibit at the museum: “Here’s Johnny! The Making of the Tonight Starring Johnny Carson.”\n\nThe exhibit uses recognizable props and costumes to guide visitors through the pioneering talk show’s 30-year run.\n\nVisitors have Carson’s nephew and long-time Fullerton resident Jeff Sotzing to thank for bringing the original exhibit to the museum. Nearly all of the items in the exhibit are from his personal collection.\n\nSotzing, 62, is the son of the late Catherine Carson-Sotzing, Carson’s older sister. He worked for “The Tonight Show” from 1977 through it’s final episode in May 1992.\n\nDisplayed memorabilia includes the plaid hunting coat and cap donned by Carson when portraying Floyd R. Turbo; the gaudy, red-checkered blazer and wig of Art Fern; and Aunt Blabby’s black granny dress and bonnet.\n\nThere is also Carson’s personal makeup kit, the coffee mug he sipped from on stage and his Rolodex, open to the card displaying contact information for Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nAn original script of a Carson monologue, cue cards and continuously streaming videos of episodes add to the exhibit.\n\nSotzing, who grew up in Philadelphia, moved to California at age 22 and studied videotape editing at Pasadena City College.\n\nAt a family Christmas gathering in 1977, Carson offered his nephew a job with the show.\n\nDuring his tenure, Sotzing was a receptionist, state manager, production assistant and associate producer, often standing to the side of the stage during taping.\n\n“I did everything on the show,” Sotzing said. “I’m a lucky guy. I got a great opportunity and ran with it.”\n\nCarson liked the small town feel of Fullerton, said Sotzing, a pilot who keeps his plane at Fullerton Airport.\n\nOn a few occasions, Sotzing flew to Santa Monica Airport to pick up his uncle and take him to Fullerton and then back home.\n\n“He and I became good friends,” he said. “He was my uncle, my employer and my friend.”\n\nThese days, Sotzing runs the Fullerton-based Carson Entertainment Group, which owns the rights to the 4,000 “Tonight Show” tapes made available for broadcast and DVD release.\n\nSotzing, who is involved in the planning of Fullerton’s annual Airport Day celebration, ran into Museum Operations Director Kelly Chidester during the recent transportation celebration.\n\nChidester and Sotzing discussed the idea of a museum exhibit featuring Carson’s “Tonight Show” memorabilia.\n\n“It certainly fits with our mission statement and what we do,” Chidester said.\n\nJohnny Carson was 79 when he died in 2005. His younger brother, Dick Carson, 86, lives in Studio City.\n\nThe John W. Carson Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Carson in 1981, gave a $12,000 grant to the museum to create an audio tour program for the “Tonight Show” exhibit.\n\nThe equipment will also be be used to create audio tours for future exhibits, Chidester said."
