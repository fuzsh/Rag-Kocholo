        "text": "Robert Edward Crane (July 13, 1928 – June 29, 1978) was an American disc jockey and actor who starred as Colonel Robert Hogan from 1965 to 1971. He was nominated for two Emmy Awards for his work on that show.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life and Childhood[]\n\nCrane was born in Waterbury, Connecticut. He graduated from high school in 1946 after performing as a drummer at school and with dance bands, as well as the Connecticut Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAdulthood and Radio Career[]\n\nIn 1949 he married his high school sweetheart, Anne Terzian; they eventually had three children, Deborah Ann, Karen Leslie and Robert David. The following year, 1950, he began his radio career by working for WLEA in Hornell, New York. He next worked for WBIS in Bristol, Connecticut. Crane next moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut to work for WICC, where he would remain until 1956, when he moved to Boston to work with WEEI, before finally moving himself and his family to California to work at KNX in Los Angeles. Once in Los Angeles, his career began to take off, filling his broadcasts with sly wit, his drumming, and such guests as Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra. Crane soon had the number one-rated morning show in the Los Angeles area, and was soon nicknamed \"The King of the Los Angeles Airwaves.\"\n\nEarly Acting Career[]\n\nCrane was always interested in acting, and at the age of 33 he started to receive some good breaks as he persued his acting career. He started first by subbing for Johnny Carson on his day time game show, Who Do You Trust?, followed by appearances on The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and General Electric Theater. When Carl Reiner guested on his radio show, he persuaded Reiner to book him a guest shot on The Dick Van Dyke Show. Crane's appearence on the show, where he played a character named \"Harry\" who tried out for the role of Mark Anthony in a local community play, would lead to him being noticed by Donna Reed. This in turn would lead to him being made a regular on The Donna Reed Show for the 1963 – 1965 seasons.\n\nHogan's Heroes[]\n\nIn 1965, Crane would be offered the part for which he is best known for, Colonel Robert Hogan, the lead role in Hogan's Heroes. The show was an instant rating smash during its first year, landing in the Top Ten. Playing Colonel Hogan, Crane would receive two Emmy Awards nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy Series in 1965 and in 1966. Also, with the series' success, Crane ended his radio career. While working on the show, he would meet and fall in love with his future wife, Sigrid Valdis. After divorcing his first wife of twenty years, Anne Terzian, the two would marry on the show's set. They would later have a son, Scotty (Robert Scott), and adopt a daughter named Anna Marie. The series itself would last for six years, still a rating hit, but a victim of CBS's \"rural purge\" of summer 1971.\n\nAfter Hogan's Heroes, Later Life, and Death[]\n\nAfter the cancellation of Hogan's Heroes Crane would continue his acting career, landing guest roles on such shows as Police Woman, Quincy, M.E. and The Love Boat and starting in a few feature films (Superdad and Gus), and being the lead in the short run sitcom, The Bob Crane Show, but he would not have another breakout role before his life was ended in 1978.\n\nDuring his time on Hogan's Heroes, Crane met John Henry Carpenter, an electronics expert who was involved in the development of the VCR. Although it is alleged that Carpenter would lure Crane into a life of sexual decadence, parts of which is disputed by Crane's family, it is known that at some point before 1966 that Crane had already developed an interest in pornographic videos. Using Carpenter's equipment, Bob would make films showing himself having sex with numerous women, with Carpenter participating in a few of them. This lifestyle would have a negative effect on his life and career. Finally, one night in 1978, Crane is alleged to have told Carpenter that their friendship was over. The following night, he was found bludgeoned to death with a video camera tripod at the Winfield Place Apartments in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he was involved in a dinner theater production of a play called Beginner's Luck at the Windmill Dinner Theatre.\n\nAccording to an A&E program on the subject, Crane had finally tired of his libertine lifestyle and wished to resume leading a more normal life. Since this would have meant cutting off his relationship with Carpenter, this decision of Crane's was presumed to be the motive for his murder. Carpenter was considered the leading suspect, but he wasn't arrested for the crime until 1992 - about fourteen years after the murder, because of the large number of suspects, the females who had been taped having sex with Crane, and the husbands of those who were married, that needed to be clear first by the prosecution. Carpenter was finally put on trial in 1994, where the prosecution showed the tapes of Crane and Carpenter having sex with several women, hoping to shock the jury, based on their long association together and motive, into finding Carpenter guilty of the crime. The prosecution's strategy backfired, and Carpenter was acquitted of the murder charge. Carpenter would die in 1998, both maintaining his innocence and his hope that the actual guilty party would be found. The crime is presently unsolved, although the local police have recently presented possible new suspects, with both the murderer and the motive behind it remaining open questions. Myths and Legends on TV Land has \"confirmed\" that Bob Crane was indeed murdered by John Carpenter.\n\nCrane's life and murder would be made the subject of the 2002 film Auto Focus. His son from his second marriage, Scotty Crane, along with his second wife, Patricia Olsen (Sigrid's real name), both objected to the way Crane was portrayed in the film and took to the media and the internet to present their side of the story.\n\nCrane is presently buried in Westwood Memorial Park on Glendon Avenue in Los Angeles.\n\nA biography on Bob Crane's life is presently being developed.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nGus (1976)\n\nMitzi...and a Hundred Guys (1975) (TV) (uncredited)\n\nThe Bob Crane Show (1975) (TV Series)\n\nHerbie Day at Disneyland (1974) (TV)\n\nSuperdad (1973)\n\nMake Mine Red, White and Blue (1972) (TV)\n\nPatriotism (1972)\n\nHoneymoon Game (1971) (TV)\n\nThe 13th Annual TV Week Logie Award (1971) (TV)\n\nArsenic and Old Lace (1969) (TV)\n\nThe Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz (1968)\n\nHogan's Heroes (1965) (TV Series)\n\nThe New Interns (1964) (uncredited)\n\nStella Adler and the Actor (1964) (TV)\n\nThe Donna Reed Show (1958) (TV Series) (1963-1965)\n\nMan-Trap (1961)\n\nReturn to Peyton Place (1961) (uncredited)\n\nNotable TV Guest Appearances[]\n\nBetty White's 90th Birthday: A Tribute to America's Golden Girl playing \"Himself\" in episode: \"Episode dated 16 January 2012\" 16 January 2012\n\nBattleground playing \"Himself\" in episode: \"Friends and Neighbors and People We Know\" (episode # 1.73) 25 March 2006\n\nBiography playing \"Himself\" in episode: \"Bob Crane: Double Life\" 8 February 2000\n\nE!
