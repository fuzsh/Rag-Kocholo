        "text": "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson was a staple of its time. It was the most modern format of live television and is what we now know as the late-night talk show. But while the Johnny Carson Show was historical, it also had its fair share of problems. From his jokes to his personal life, Carson wasn't perfect. Some of his real-life interactions and disputes with people might surprise you, including his four failed marriages and the guest that Carson couldn't stand! He was even known to make jokes at the expense of other celebrities.\n\nUnhappy Husbandry\n\nWhile he is a beloved television icon, Johnny Carson was no saint. Carson is known to have treated some of those around him with disrespect. And you would assume that when someone gets married, they are happy and in love, right? Well, one of Carson's worst displays was from a time he publicly embarrassed his new wife on their honeymoon.\n\nIn 1987, after Carson marrying Alexis Maas (his fourth wife), the honeymooning couple traveled to Italy for a yacht trip. Carson quickly fell into a foul mood and he took it out on his new wife. At one point, he told her in front of others, after some inconsequential remark he didn't care for, \"We've been married for three weeks. If you say something like that again, this marriage won't last another three weeks.\""
