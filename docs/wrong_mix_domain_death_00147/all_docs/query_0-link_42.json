        "text": "FAQs\n\nQ: Who is the ideal SBC MIR Program candidate?\n\nA: Scottsdale Bible Church is seeking to train and develop the next generation of full-time vocational ministry leaders to pursue the work of the Church—here at SBC and in the Kingdom at large. Ideally, our Ministers-in-Residence have an affirmed call to ministry and are looking for an opportunity to gain practical training toward a future pastoral career, a theological education, and development of their unique gifts as their call is matured.\n\nQ: What areas of ministry work are available to MIRs?\n\nA: As a full-service church, SBC has many ministry areas in which we can develop future pastoral staff. Placement opportunities are available in areas of Spiritual Formation (Men’s, Women’s, Groups), Family (Marriage, Children, Students, Young Adults), Outreach (Local and Global), and even areas of Church Administration. To maximize development and training, our MIRs are regularly considered and evaluated for placement rotation to new ministry areas throughout their time in the program. We intentionally balance the development needs of our MIRs with the logistical needs of SBC in all placement decisions. ***In addition to the above-mentioned ministry areas, we dedicate one MIR opening for a Worship & Arts candidate. This MIR will work exclusively in this ministry area for the duration of his/her program.\n\nQ: What is the time commitment required of an MIR?\n\nA: SBC MIRs are onboarded as part-time employees and expected to work in their ministry placement for approximately 20 hours per week in addition to simultaneously pursuing a full-time seminary course load. Because of this expectation, additional outside employment is highly discouraged and must ultimately be approved by the MIR Committee for admission/continuation in the program. We believe the SBC MIR Program is a challenging but wholly worthwhile opportunity!\n\nQ: Does an applicant have to be currently attending seminary to be considered?\n\nA: Ideally an applicant to our program has not yet begun his/her seminary program. Neither does an applicant have to be already admitted to a seminary program to be considered. However, any offer of employment will be contingent upon full admission to a qualifying graduate seminary program prior to the employment start date. Applicants who have already begun a seminary program are still welcome to apply and will be fully considered; however, this factor will be assessed in the context of mutual SBC/MIR value of investment.\n\nQ: What is considered a qualifying graduate seminary program?\n\nA: Ideally, SBC MIRs will be enrolled in a graduate (master’s level) program through Dallas Theological Seminary (online program). If an MIR applicant wishes to attend a different seminary, this must be approved in the context of alignment with SBC’s Statement of Faith. An MIR is eligible to pursue a terminal degree of master’s level or equivalent; pursuit of a doctoral level degree is incongruent with the purpose of our program.\n\nQ: Does the MIR Program include financial compensation?\n\nA: SBC MIRs are compensated for their part-time employment at an established annual rate of $26,208. Additionally, a generous tuition (up to 100%) scholarship is offered depending on the seminary chosen. As a part-time employee, an MIR is ineligible for healthcare and PTO benefits.\n\nQ: Does the MIR Program include housing?\n\nA: The MIR program does not include housing.\n\nQ: Can SBC assist with work permits or visas for international applicants?\n\nA: MIR candidates are required to be eligible for work in the United States to be considered for our program; SBC is unable to assist with this process. In some cases, the seminary to which an MIR is admitted may be able to assist with a student visa. An international applicant should check with his/her seminary regarding options for assistance with student work permit/visa needs.\n\nQ: Does an MIR have to attend Scottsdale Bible Church?\n\nA: While many of our MIR candidates are not current attendees at the time of their application, acceptance into our program (as an SBC employee) is contingent upon a candidate agreeing to attendance at SBC as well as church membership. SBC membership requires agreement with our Statement of Faith and Statement on Marriage and Sexuality.\n\nQ: How long is the SBC MIR Program?\n\nA: The SBC MIR program is a three (3) year development program; as such, MIRs are eligible for a renewal of their employment for up to three (3) years. As an SBC employee, MIRs are subject to all HR policies and expectations.\n\nQ: How many MIRs are included in the SBC MIR Program?\n\nA: The number of MIRs in our program varies depending on our annual budget capacity. Although all MIRs work individually in their assigned ministry areas, they work together as a cohort in additional arenas of our program designed for their collective development and support of each other—professionally, spiritually, relationally, and educationally.\n\nQ: When does the next MIR Program start?\n\nA: The SBC MIR Program does not include designated start/end times. We are open to applications and onboarding of new MIRs at any time. If we do not currently have an opening in our program, we always welcome applications who can be fully considered for future openings.\n\nQ: Does SBC provide job placement support for graduated MIRs?\n\nA: Yes! SBC is fully committed to the best of our ability to help our MIRs find full-time pastoral ministry placements—at Scottsdale Bible Church or other churches in the local community, across the United States, or even internationally. Within six (6) months of the program end, SBC will begin a process of helping an MIR prepare for employment, including: the creation of teaching videos, resume review, letters of recommendation, interview practice, and personal connections to other churches. Further, SBC MIRs are always highly considered for positions that become available on our own church staff. We love it when one of our MIRs is the perfect candidate for one of our open positions!"
