Their parents were Ukrainian immigrants and their mother taught the children to read Shakespeare and to appreciate the music they heard every Saturday on the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts.\n\nSTEPHEN ‘TWITCH’ BOSS REMEMBERED: ALLISON HOLKER SHARES FIRST POST FOLLOWING HUSBAND'S DEATH AT 40\n\nThe four youngest boys began singing at local events as the Urick Brothers. Ed was still in high school when they moved to nightclubs, but as a husky six-footer with a deep voice, he was able to pass for 21.\n\nIn New York, comedy writer Abe Burrows advised a name change because Urick was hard to remember. Ames was the brothers’ choice. The group was popular throughout the 1950s with popular hits including, \"Sentimental Me,\" and \"You, You, You.\"\n\nDriven to run...It's the Ames Brothers during a recording session.

His first starring role was an off-Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ‘The Crucible.’\n\nHowever, on television, Ames was likely best known for his role as Mingo, the Oxford-educated Native American in the 1960s adventure series \"Daniel Boone\" that starred Fess Parker as the famous frontiersman.\n\nTINA TURNER MOURNED BY HOLLYWOOD AFTER ICON'S DEATH AT 83: ‘SIMPLY THE BEST’\n\nDue to his role in \"Daniel Boone,\" Ames became skilled at throwing a tomahawk, which led the actor to one of his most memorable moments of his career during a hilarious appearance on ‘The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson’ on April 27, 1965.\n\nWhile on the show, Carson asked Ames to demonstrate his skills by throwing a tomahawk at a target of a cowboy outlined on a wooden panel.\n\nAmes’ throw landed directly in the groin of the wooden cowboy, which caused the studio audience burst into laughter.\n\nEd Ames pictured in the 1970s.
