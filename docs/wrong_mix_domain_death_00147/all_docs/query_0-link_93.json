        "text": "\"For those of you who don?t know me my name is James and I am the youngest of 7 children born to my parents Joseph and Irene Driscoll. I would like to begin by thanking everyone for being here to remember and honor my father Joseph. Today we are here to grieve the loss of my father whom I will miss greatly. My father loved to tell jokes and was very athletic in his younger years. When I was in High School we would oftentimes watch Johnny Carson together and laugh and joke about the shows punch lines for several days. When he was in his late Fifties I brought him skiing in Flagstaff during one of the worst snow storms I have ever been in, we joked about that for years. Then when he was in his late sixties I brought him parasailing it didn\\'t bother him at all, while I on the other hand said I would never do that again. My father had a wonderful way of making life seem more enjoyable. Psalm 90:10 The days of our lives are seventy years; And if by reason of strength they are eighty years, Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Let?s not forget what he has taught us over the years and cherish all of the great memories we had together.\""
