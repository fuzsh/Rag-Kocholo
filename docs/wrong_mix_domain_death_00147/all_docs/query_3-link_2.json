        "text": "(Los Angeles-AP) Feb. 10, 2005 - A few more details have been released concerning the death of \"Tonight Show\" legend Johnny Carson.\n\nHis death certificate, obtained by the Associated Press, says he died in a Los Angeles hospital, not at his Malibu home as earlier reported, and his body was cremated.\n\nCarson died at 6:50am on January 23rd at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was 79.\n\nThe immediate cause of death was ten minutes of \"respiratory arrest\" with the underlying cause 20 years of emphysema. The family had announced Carson's death in a brief statement but refused to disclose any details.\n\nNBC TV, where Carson hosted the \"Tonight Show\" for 30 years before retiring in 1992, reported that he died of emphysema at his Malibu estate. There was no autopsy.\n\nThe ashes from Carson's body were given to the entertainer's wife, Alexis."
