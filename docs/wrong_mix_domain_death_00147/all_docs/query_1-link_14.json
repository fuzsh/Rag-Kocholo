        "text": "Tidbits/comments/e-mails (oldest is at the top of this list):\n\nSunset's birth year has been reported in various publications and biographies - as well as in statements from Sunset - as: 1918, 1920, 1922, 1924, 1926, 1927, more.\n\nE-mail from Sue Parrish: \"My mother went to school with him - but not at Plainview, Texas. It was at Earth-Springlake, Texas.\"\n\nE-mail from Jerry Whittington: \"Sunset's driver's license showed his birthplace as Plainview, Texas and birthdate as November 12, 1927.\"\n\nE-mail from Boyd Magers: \"This comes from Bill Thomas of Florida who was Sunset's manager for a while. Sunset lived with him for 6 months. I've acquired some of Sunset's personal belongings from Bill and a raft of rare family photos. Sunset was born in 1924! Father was Maurice Harrison. Mother's name forgotten by Bill. Sunset's younger sister is Alese who is now (or at least was) a doctor in San Francisco. Sunset's younger brother was Dale Harrison and was in a couple of the Walt Mattox pics (SUNSET CARSON RIDES AGAIN and FIGHTING MUSTANG). Last known to be selling heavy equipment in Texas. Sunset had two kids, born to he and wife Margaret (reportedly a \"little bitty thing\") ... names forgotten ... while Sunset was in Australia with Wirth Circus. This would be around 1970. Boy reportedly still in Australia. Daughter unknown whereabouts.\"\n\nIn November, 2003, I received several e-mails from 'Mimi' Combs and her son-in-law Tom Sutherland, and have summarized their info as follows: Betty Jo Price and Sunset Carson had a son named Michael. After she and Sunset divorced, Betty married Mimi's brother, Dr. Edward Johnson who was a Harvard Medical School Graduate and an Orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta, Georgia for many years. Ed passed away in 2002. Betty died in 1993. Ed adopted Mike and raised him as his son. He was only 4 years old when Ed married Betty. Michael James Johnson was killed in a tractor accident on his farm in Autauga County, Alabama on November 16, 2003. He was 55 years old.\n\nThe Family Search website has the 1930 census on the Maurice G. Harrison family who were residing in Precinct 4, Hale, Texas. Winifred is listed as 9 years old, and that seems to confirm a circa 1920 - 1921 birth date. Go to: https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/HBM4-RZM\n\nIn October, 2004, Bob Blevens e-mailed with more details from that 1930 Federal census. Note there is no twin brother named Dale and the family resided in Hale County, Texas (Plainview, Texas is the County Seat of Hale County).\n\nTexas, Hale County, Justice Precinct 4, Enumeration District 95-13, Sheet Number 8-A, Enumeration Date 18 Apr 1930, response status as of 1 Apr 1930 (Census Day).\n\nLines 45-49, Dwelling 155, Family 160.\n\nHarrison, Maurice G., Head, home owned, farm, male, white, age 32, married, age 21 first marriage, did not attend school after 1 Sep 1929, can read and write, born GA, parents born GA, can speak English, Farmer, general farming industry, owner, employed, non-veteran.\n\nHarrison, Azalee, wife, female, white, age 31, married, age 20 first marriage, did not attend school, can read and write, born TX, parents born TX, can speak English.\n\nHarrison, Winifred, son, male, white, age 9, single, attended school, born OK, parents born TX.\n\nHarrison, Herman D., son, male, white, age 6, single, attended school, born OK, parents born TX.\n\nHarrison, Azalee G., daughter, female, white, age 2-2/12, single, did not attend school, born OK, parents born TX (the 2-2/12 for Azalee's age is two years and two months)."
