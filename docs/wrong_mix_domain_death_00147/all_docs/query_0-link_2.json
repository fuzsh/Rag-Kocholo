She graduated high school with some friends of mine. She still lives there...or somewhere in So. AZ. Marty Robbins and Wayne Newton were both born here but I don't think Wayne has a home here anymore. Then there's Glen Campbell. Johnny Carson had a home in Paradise Valley and Nancy Reagans family lived there too. Dick Van Dyke had/has a home in Cave Creek, I think. Tons of celebs live in AZ. In Sedona there are a few too. Linda Carter is one."
