        "text": "Cleopatra is a Roman film released in 2764, an epic historical drama film based on the life Cleopatra but focusing largely as well on Antony's Civil War. Starring Roman model turned actress Alba Marcianos as Cleopatra.\n\nThe film was a box office success in Romania and much of Europe but courted controversy abroad, especially in Grecia, Egypt, and Persia. Among the issues was the use of a Roman actress to play the Egyptian queen rather than an Egyptian or even a Grecian actress. Additional to this was the lack of historical accuracy with a general lack of Greco-Egyptian style found in the film and a general ignoring of the Grecian atmosphere and background of Egypt of the time. It was noted by other historians that Cleopatra would have indeed by Grecian in background and her head was said to be a shade of red.\n\nAmong Persian critiques there was a general disdain for the continued perception and display of 'exotic and villainous easterners' who are barbaric and cruel - here using the Persian Parthians as stock villains. Likewise the portrayal of the Egyptians is much the same, as scheming, with eunuchs and plots, while the Romans are displayed typically as rational, stoic, and earthy (except the Gabiani Garrison, which is made up of brutish and thuggish Germans in the film).\n\nThe film is also critiqued for displaying situations for Cleopatra that occurred well before Caesar's death, even before his conquest of Gallia, but shown in the film following alongside Mark Antony's conflict with Brutus and after the death of Caesar. Likewise it jumps ahead during that conflict to Antony's Civil War quickly.\n\nAn interesting side note of the film - Selene became a popular baby name for girls in Romania after the film.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe film opens with Crassus' loss to the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae and his subsequent death - showing in the film his being killed by having melted gold poured down his throat. Ptolemy XII has Berenice IV and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties. Ptolemy allows Gabinius's largely Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison, the Gabiniani, to harass people in the streets of Alexandria and installs his longtime Roman financier Rabirius as his chief financial officer.\n\nDespite these problems, Ptolemy XII created a will designating Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs. The film moves ahead and reveals on 31 May Cleopatra is made a regent of Ptolemy XII.\n\nSwitching to the post-death of Caesar, the film follows the machinations of Rome and chaos following the assassination, following Mark Antony.\n\nBack in Egypt Ptolemy XII dies and Cleopatra, in her first act as queen, began her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nMarcus Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, sends his two eldest sons to Egypt, to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians. However, the Gabiniani tortured and murdered these two, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra sends the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment, but he sends them back to Cleopatra and chastised her for interfering in their adjudication, which was the prerogative of the Roman Senate.\n\nCleopatra and Ptolemy XIII begin a conflict as the film displays Cleopatra showing disdain for the common-place sibling marriage of the Egyptian royalty, rebuffing the advances of Ptolemy. Despite Cleopatra's rejection of him, Ptolemy XIII still retains powerful allies, notably the eunuch Potheinos, his childhood tutor, regent, and administrator of his properties. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas, a prominent military commander, and Theodotus of Chios, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra attempts a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and begins signing documents with his name before that of his sister.\n\nThe films picks up the infighting within the Triumvirate. In the summer, Octavian and Antony sailed for Macedonia to face the Liberators with nineteen legions, the vast majority of their army, leaving Rome under the administration of Lepidus. Likewise, the army of the Liberators also commanded an army of nineteen legions; their legions, however, were not at full strength while the legions of Antony and Octavian are. While the Triumvirs commanded a larger number of infantry, the Liberators commanded a larger cavalry contingent. The Liberators, who controlled Macedonia, did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the Triumvirs' communications with their supply base in Italia. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies from Rome's client kingdoms.\n\nIn the resulting first battle of Philippi, Antony defeats Cassius and captures his camp while Brutus overruns Octavian's troops and penetrates into the Triumvirs' camp but is unable to capture the sick Octavian. The battle is a tactical draw but due to poor communications Cassius believed the battle was a complete defeat and committed suicide to prevent being captured.\n\nBrutus assumes sole command of the Liberator army and preferred a war of attrition over open conflict. His officers, however, are dissatisfied with these defensive tactics and his Caesarian veterans threatened to defect, forcing Brutus to give battle at the second battle of Philippi on 23 October. While the battle was initially evenly matched, Antony's leadership routed Brutus' forces. Brutus committed suicide the day after the defeat and the remainder of his army swears allegiance to the Triumvirate. Over fifty thousand Romans die in the two battles. While Antony treats the losers mildly, Octavian deals cruelly with his prisoners and even beheads Brutus' corpse.\n\nCleopatra invites Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos. Antony is well received by the populace of Alexandria for coming to Egypt without an occupation force, it is said in the film \"like Caesar had done\" though such an event is not shown in the film. In Egypt, Antony continues to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.\n\nCleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner for producing further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise. The film shows Cleopatra calculating this move in order to assure her own survival but the two fall in love in due course.\n\nBy the spring, Antony leaves Egypt due to troubles in Syria, where his governor Lucius Decidius Saxa was killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus, a former officer under Cassius who now with great treachery serves the Parthian Empire. Cleopatra provides Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. Cleopatra gives birth to twins, a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II, both of whom Antony acknowledges as his children. Helios (the Sun) and Selene (the Moon) are symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as an indication that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering the Parthians.\n\nMark Antony's Parthian campaign in the east is disrupted by the events of the Perusine War, initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. Fulvia, jealous, wants to cleave Antony away from Cleopatra. Fulvia and Antony's brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia and then exiled from Italia, after which Fulvia died at Sicyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death leads to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italia in.\n\nIn December Cleopatra receives Herod in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea. Herod had been installed as a tetrarch there by Antony, but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long-established Hasmonean dynasty. The latter had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael, who was executed while Herod was fleeing toward Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra attempts to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declines and traveles to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Antony named him king of Judea. This act puts Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who would desire to reclaim the former Ptolemaic territories that comprised his new Herodian kingdom.\n\nRelations between Antony and Cleopatra sour when he not only marries Octavia, but also sires her two children, Antonia the Elder and Antonia Minor and moves his headquarters to Athens. However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt is secure. Her rival Herod is occupied with civil war in Judea that requires heavy Roman military assistance, but receives none from Cleopatra. Antony summons Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues, such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign and the tensions of their relationship emerges. Cleopatra brings her now three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Antony sees them for the first time.\n\nAntony's Parthian campaign begins but turns into a complete debacle, in particular the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia is shown in the film to be a significant cause, with the Armenians defecting to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men Antony finally arrives at Leukokome in December, engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrives to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Antony desires to avoid the risks involved in returning to Rome, and so he traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria where the two make love\n\nIn a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship Octavian accuses Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and territorial integrity as a slave to his Oriental queen. Octavian declares Antony an enemy of the state and declares war on him.\n\nOctavian, now close to absolute power, does not intend to give Antony and Cleopatra any rest. In August, assisted by Agrippa, he invades Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony stabs himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he dies in her arms.\n\nOctavian enters Alexandria, occupies the palace, and seizes Cleopatra's three youngest children. When she meets with Octavian, Cleopatra tells him bluntly, \"I will not be led in a triumph\". Octavian promises that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his future plans for her kingdom. When a spy informs her that Octavian plans to move her and her children to Rome in three days, she prepares for suicide as she had no intentions of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. Cleopatra allows an Egyptian cobra to bite her breast and poison her, where she dies.\n\nOctavian is angered by this outcome but has Cleopatra buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb.\n\nCleopatra had decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt, with plans to flee to Kushite Nubia. The film reveals through text that \"Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, would reign for a mere 18 days until executed on the orders of Octavian after returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. Octavian was convinced by the advice of the philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Roman province of Egypt was established, marking the end of the Hellenistic period. Octavian was renamed Augustus and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire.\""
