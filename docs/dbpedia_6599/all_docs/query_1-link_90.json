Her family had been ruling Egypt since the conquest of Alexander the Great. She was well-educated, learning astronomy, philosophy, and multiple languages, including Egyptian, which was rare for a Ptolemaic ruler.\n\nAt just 18, she became co-regent with her brother, Ptolemy XIII, but conflict soon arose, leading to her temporary exile.

She successfully negotiated complex political landscapes, proving women's capabilities in decision-making roles.\n\nModern female politicians often cite Cleopatra as an early example of powerful female leadership.
