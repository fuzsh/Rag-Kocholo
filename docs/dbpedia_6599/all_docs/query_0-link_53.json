Produced in 1963, this movie is a one of a kind as it portrays the Roman Republic transition. Although the motion picture is mostly very true to the historic facts, there are a few examples where the producers deviated from accuracy. The movie is not entirely correct with some of the costume and set choices, representation of the character Octavian, and Mark Antony’s family affairs.

Overall, this movie is in general very accurate, but it certainly does cut out some significant historic details, especially pertaining to Antony and Cleopatra’s children.\n\nAll in all, the 1963 movie “Cleopatra” is an epic representation of Cleopatra’s relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.
