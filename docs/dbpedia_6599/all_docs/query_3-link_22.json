        "text": "There is a reason why I usually do not review movies from the \"golden age\" of Hollywood (which means any movie prior to the 1970s), and that is because back then they cared even less about historical accuracy in costuming than nowadays, which is saying a lot. Because of this, most of the \"historical\" movies generally ignored the period and just did whatever was fashionable at the time with a spice of the supposed period.\n\nThis is something that usually makes me laugh, rather than angry, because it results in very funny outfits (peplums particularly created a lot of funny imaginary). And Cleopatra, 1963's epic about the Egyptian queen, was for most of my childhood one of those movies. I knew the costumes were not accurate, but they fascinated me anyways in their ridiculousness. That is until I heard that the movie had won an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Costume Design, the same year that \"Il Gattopardo was nominated for Best Costume Design. And they chose to give it to the fun-camp that is Cleopatra. I sometimes wonder why do I even care...\n\nWell, today I feel like poking fun at things, so let's go over the designs for the epic of epics that is Cleopatra.\n\nABOUT THE MOVIE\n\nCleopatra is a 1963 epic directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and, to this day, stands as one of the most expensive movies ever made. Its production became famous for its massive cost overrun and production troubles: such as changes in director and cast, a change of filming locale, sets that had to be constructed twice, lack of a firm shooting script, and personal scandal around its co-stars. Because of this, the movie almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox.\n\nIt also was never supposed to be only one movie. It was meant as two movies: a first part called Caesar and Cleopatra and a second part called Anthony and Cleopatra. But when it came the time to premiere, such hype had been played on the Burton-Taylor real-life drama, that the studio was afraid that no one was going to see the first part (where Burton did not appear) and so, turned the two movies into one mammoth of a four-hour movie.\n\nCleopatra also happens to be the height of Elizabeth Taylor's career and the beginning of the never-ending Burton-Taylor drama.\n\nBecause of all these, the movie is often more remembered for its context and significance than for the actual movie. Which, no surprise, is not that good.\n\nABOUT THE STORY\n\nThe movie chronicles the struggles of Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII, starting with the Battle of Pharsalus until her death. The movie focusses on her intrigues in order to resist the imperial ambitions of Rome and her conquests of Caesar and Marc Anthony. And it covers the period between 51 BC and 30 BC.\n\nABOUT THE COSTUME DESIGN\n\nThe costume design for the movie was created by Renié Conley, Vittorio Nino Novarese and Irene Sharaff and, as mentioned in the intro, won an Academy Award for it. The approach to the designs is pretty similar to the approach the movie has to the story: it has to be big and it has to be flashy. And above all, it has to make Elizabeth Taylor the star of it all.\n\nAll of this means that their take on design is not really very historically accurate. It's more like the Las Vegas version of Cleopatra. And to top it all, it doesn't really stand the test of time.\n\nThe biggest bummer is that most of the designs are straight up 60's fashion with an Egyptian flair to top it. But, let's not get ahead of ourselves, and in order to put everything into perspective let's take a little history class.\n\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Ptolemy, one of his Generals, was appointed as governor of Egypt as the Great Alexandrine Empire fell to pieces. In 305 BC, he set aside the title of governor and crowned himself king, becoming Ptolemy I giving birth to the last dynasty of Egyptian rulers before the conquest of the Roman Empire.\n\nTherefore, the Ptolemaic dynasty, as it would come to be known, was actually Greek, not Egyptian. But in order to be accepted by the Egyptian people, they adopted many of the traditions and aesthetics of the Pharaohs of old, including the one where they married brother to sister in order to keep the divine bloodline pure.\n\nIn their official representations (mural paintings, coins) meant for the Egyptian people, they would pose as Egyptian gods, but on their representations towards the outward world, they would pose as Greeks. Playing a double game.\n\nCleopatra VII was the last of these greek rulers to take the throne of Egypt and she played the popularity game better than any of her ancestors. Any woman previous to her that had wanted to rule Egypt, had had to dress up as a man because Egyptians believed that the Pharaoh was the earthly incarnation of Horus and therefore had to be a guy. But Cleopatra changed that and presented herself as the earthly incarnation of Isis (the most important female divinity). And so, she appeared in front of her people dressed as her.\n\nRepresentation of Cleopatra dressed as Isis.\n\nBut despite all this, she was still Greek and the most well-known bust we have of her shows us how she actually dressed in privacy.\n\nI can understand that the Egyptian version is much more appealing and entrancing and that many movies ignore that double game, but if you are going to embrace the whole Isis thing, could they at least not have turned it into this?\n\nIt should be, actually, something like this:\n\nIsis is the one with the white dress,\n\nthe other is Neftis\n\nBut here lies the main problem for me; they ignored the actual historical fact that she was Greek and only dressed as a \"typical\" Egyptian to impress and keep the popularity going and actually dressed her as if she was Egyptian. But then chose to ignore actual Egyptian fashion and dress her as a 60's Las Vegas showgirl.\n\nThey basically took the 60's cut for dresses and tried to give it an overall Egyptian feel. This is especially noticeable in the costumes for Cleopatra herself.\n\nThe cut of the bust is completely 60's, especially the corseted under-bust that creates the typically pointed breasts of the late '50s. Most of her dresses are variations on that dress shape, which is totally wrong for an Egyptian dress. The traditional cut was actually closer to these:\n\nIt's pretty sad that paper dolls get it right when movies can't. Actually, there is only one dress that is historically accurate when it comes to cut and it appears barely for a second and it's worn by a maid:\n\nThis brings us to the second enormous beef I have with the designs: there are way too many synthetic materials and gold lamé and way too little cotton and linen.\n\nThat dress is, cut-wise, a bit more historical. It's a decent attempt at a Greek dress until you notice the fabric..... I doubt ancient Egypt had synthetic materials. It should be either cotton or linen (both materials were actually made famous by Egyptians, so it's ironic they ignore it), not this horrible looking synthetic material. Also, she is clearly wearing a corset underneath, which gives her the complete wrong bust line for Greek fashion. But that is a lost battle with 50's and 60's Peplums.\n\nAnd, behold the gold lamé! Which, of course, did not exist until the 1930s, but who cares... right?? This dress really makes me mad because aside from the corset-type bust it's actually one of the most \"historically correct\" gowns in the movie. But once you notice the gold lamé there is no coming back. It actually ruins the complete look for me. Was it so difficult to do this dress in white linen?\n\nThe thing is, apparently, that they wanted to dress Cleopatra in gold because it looks more regal. Except that no Egyptian royalty ever wore gold lamé. She would have worn a white linen tunic decorated with lots of gold jewelry.\n\nThis whole gold affair leads up to what probably is the most iconic dress of the movie, and of Elizabeth Taylor's career. The Gold Gown she wears on her entrance in Rome.\n\nAs iconic as it is, it's actually the second most \"historically accurate\" design in the movie, except for the gold lamé, yet again.\n\nIt takes inspiration from the traditional representation of Isis especially on the wings, and the crown is actually really good, except that it looks like plastic, but that's fairly normal when looking at productions back then.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good design, probably the only one in the movie. Especially when the movie has the balls to dress her in a 60's leopard print coat later in the movie.\n\nReally? The movie is trolling us... it has to be that\n\nLast but not least in my tiny list of beef with these designs is the absolutely horrendous way in which everything has to sparkle and ruin the few things that were actually decent, to begin with.\n\nThe cut of the dress is completely wrong, true, and the material is also wrong. But that crown is not, except for the fact that it has glitter on it (the dress also has glitter by the way). Just to clarify; glitter did not exist in 30 BC Egypt. Not for clothes, not for crowns and definitely not for makeup.\n\nLook at that... glittery makeup. It's true, Egyptian wore a lot of makeup (both men and women): they used kohl and they painted their eyes (heavily). It's actually one of the few ancient cultures that was not shy about makeup. But they generally used heavy basic colors. Why? because glitter was not a thing back then.\n\nActually, the overabundance of glitter is one of the things in the movie that helps immensely to highlight the Las Vegas feel of the whole production. Some of these designs look as if they raided a Las Vegas dance show. And that's not ok.\n\nThe whole thing is that they are making all those changes to create a sexy, exotic vibe, when the Egyptian fashion, as it was, was already sexy and exotic. More so than what they create here. So why did they do it?\n\nSo much glitter...\n\nAnd to top it all, let's have a look at the hairstyles, which are a very eclectic mix that ranges from \"oh, that's pretty nice and accurate\" to \"what on earth is she wearing on her head\". Because I like to see the positive in everything I'm going to start with the first category.\n\nAside from the god-awful coat, the crown is actually nice and accurate, as is the following crown.\n\nIt's a really historic design and the plastic is not actually that noticeable. Good for you, movie.\n\nThe beaded-ringlet wig is also accurate and looks really nice on her. And for once the makeup is not glittery, which helps the look a lot.\n\nShe has several variations on the beaded-ringlet wig, and the vast majority of them are really good. But occasionally, they mess it up a bit.\n\nLike here. I think they went a little overboard with the beads. Just a tad.\n\nHere the beads are ok, what bothers me is the \"thing\" she's wearing as a... crown? your guess is as good as mine. I've you squint, you might say it's a Roman laurel crown, but if it's that, then it's really badly done.\n\nThat seems to be a category in and on itself on this movie; the \"if you were going for this... well, it's close enough I guess\" category, which includes masterful pieces such as this:\n\nYou can tell what they were going for, but it's not quite there. It actually looks as if she's forgotten to unwrap the back of the wig. It's weird at best, ugly at worst. But at least it has good intentions.\n\nI guess this is also the case for this silver crown. The shape is alright, but the materials... it looks as if they sprayed it with silver paint. Which makes it look cheap, which I doubt was the initial intent.\n\nThe same goes for this wig. I guess they were going for the Nefertiti wig (I'm pretty sure it's not called that, but it was very popular during her reign and so, I call it that).\n\nBut once again, it's close, but not really. And it also looks cheap.\n\nThis wig is another prime example; I'm pretty sure they were trying to do the jagged cut wig, which consisted in a wig cut at three different levels (like a Christmas tree), but it's not close enough. This wig doesn't have jagged cuts, the change of length is too smooth and they actually look like waves.\n\nBut this is nothing, literally nothing, once compared to the \"what on earth is she wearing on her head\" category, also known as \"please kill me now or I will stab my own eyes\", which includes beauties such as this:\n\nVegas much? The shape is sloppy and the materials are cheap and awful and so is the fabric of the dress, which looks like my grandmother's drapery.... and it's just terrible to look at. Unfortunately, it's not as bad as the \"floral bath cap\".\n\nOnce again, this is more 60's than anything. And even by 60's standard, it's awful, terrible and disgraceful. Why would you put that on her head? But apparently, the trend caught on.\n\nOne bath cap was not enough, Cleopatra needed two different versions of the same horrible fashion. Only this time, it looks like a furry wig, which makes it even worse. It doesn't even look that good on her, and she's bloody Elizabeth Taylor. She's gorgeous, so if she doesn't look good with one of your designs, you're doing something very wrong.\n\nAs for the last category of hair-dresses, there's the \"we are not even trying anymore, this is the 60's\" material. This, basically, consists of the many times when they just rolled cameras with her day to day style of hair. Watch out for those beehives!\n\nFor those who don't know, the beehive was one of the most fashionable hairstyles of the '60s and it looked something like that:\n\nWhich is exactly what she's wearing! And it appears in a lot of scenes.\n\nHere it is coupled with the most forward-fashion statement ever. Apparently, Cleopatra wore pants. That's a good one. But, back to the beehive. Look at this:\n\nThis is the least Egyptian thing I've seen in a long time, and I've spent the last three days writing about this movie. So go figure. It actually reminds me of the Beehive Audrey Hepburn sported in Breakfast at Tiffany's, down to the shiny jewelry.\n\nAdd a little curled fringe and you have the Cleopatra look. This should be a crime. But it gets worse, look at this:\n\nThe Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf vibes are strong with this one.\n\nThen, there's the one that really bothers me, but no one seems to get why; which is the straight, shoulder-length wig.\n\nThis is what she wears in the movie whenever she's in private, so let's back up a bit. Cleopatra was of Greek descent and she looked something like this:\n\nSo, on her private time, she would not be wearing an Egyptian-style wig. She would wear her natural hair and it would look something like this:\n\nCompared to all the horrible styles I've shown before, this should be a minor beef. But it's not. The devil is in the details, more so in movies. And this was an easy detail.\n\nBut I suppose I should be wrapping up. The rest of the cast is also dressed in a similar mix of \"oh that's decent\" and \"god, stab my eyes\" wardrobe, so there's little to say there without getting repetitive. I guess, then, that it's time to lay down and let the asp loose so that we can all die knowing the disgrace that it is that such a movie has an Academy Award for Best Costume Design.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is the fact that these designers were not bad designers. Irene Sharaff, in particular, has some amazing work to her credit; An American in Paris (1951), West Side Story (1961), The Taming of The Shrew (1967) and Hello! Dolly (1969). So it amazes me that they turned out such a result.\n\nBut it's nothing out of my range of expectations to see an early 60's Peplum with such designs; it's actually the norm. Most of these big epic Peplums of the time were awful in regards to costume design. What does not enter in my range of expectations is that the Academy Awards would bestow the title of Best Costume Design of 1963 to this movie when it was competing against Il Gattopardo (designs by Piero Tosi), which to this day stands as one of the best (and more historically accurate) costume designs ever made.\n\nWith that said, I thoroughly apologize for the rant. I was going over the list of movies that had won an Oscar for Costume Design back when I was preparing the Oscar retrospective for our Tumblr (here) and just got really mad at this fact. And sometimes you just need to get it out.\n\nI hope you enjoy the night and hope I don't get too upset about who wins in tonight's Oscars Gala.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support the blog,\n\nconsider buying me a Coffee? 💛💛\n\nIf you want more content like this, subscribe!

And, even months after its release in cinemas, there still continues to be a lot of buzz around it. Why? Mainly, because a lot of people feel that it is just doesn't look that good. The thing is, Belle's animated yellow ball gown is, at this point, an iconic staple of animated cinema. Everybody knows it and everybody loves it. And, as a result, everybody can see the new one and say \"this is not the costume I know\". Therefore, everyone can compare it down to the smallest detail and see that it just doesn't quite look right. Today, my goal will be to try and dissect the design in order to answer the burning question everyone has been asking themselves: what's so wrong with the \"new\" dress? Or, to put it bluntly, why is it so incredibly underwhelming?\n\nLove her or hate her, Padme and her costumes can never be far from our minds. They are too iconic, and probably one of the few memorable aspects of the prequels, so it's really fun to talk about them. And so, I've decided to continue what I started and focus on the costumes I left behind from Episode II . So let's dive back into it! A BRIEF REMINDER What are the Annexes? Well, the Annexes focus on all the costumes that were \"left behind\" in my selection of Padme Costumes for the A look into Star Wars: Padme's Dresses series. Here, I point out influences, likes, and dislikes, and anything that might feel relevant whilst digging into the gigantic wardrobe of this Galactic Queen. With this out of the way, let's go! ANNEX B: THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES Episode II: The Attack of the Clones brings the character and her designs to a completely different level; she is not a queen anymore, which unfortunately means that she no longer has amazingly weird an\n\nEvery girl, at some point in life, has wanted to be a princess. It has become undeniable that the concept of the \"princess\" is, for better or worst, inseparable from girlhood. We live in a \"princesses\" obsessed era, and we have for a long time now. And a lot has been said about it, with loud people yelling over the internet about the positive and negative aspects of it. So it was about time for me to join the yelling contest, I guess. If I'm going to talk about princesses, the logical place to go is to the Global Mogul Conglomerate that has led the trend and, in many ways, defined it: Disney. They have, undeniably, redefined the fairytale and have turned the term \"princess\" into a best selling Licensed Entertainment Character Merchandise. The thing is, even though princesses have been part of the fairy tale canon for a very long time, they didn't become the central figure until Walt Disney placed them there. In the tales that the G\n\nI've never been a purist with historical accuracy as long as the changes made have real reasoning behind (generally a narrative or symbolic one). I will always think that La reine Margot (1994) costume design is one of the most gorgeous and smart designs ever, even if said designs' main premise is to purposely bend the period in regards to costume. But there are certain things that bother me in regards to historical accuracy in costume which I realized when I found myself constantly irritated while watching The other Boleyn Girl (2008). This led me to post a question: when is it right to bend history? why is it interesting sometimes? whilst other times it's simply horrendous? To me, when these changes are made for the narrative's sake, I'm usually on board (like the 2012's \"Anna Karenina\" designs, which mixed the 1870's fashion with 1950's fashion in order to enhance the sense of theatricality and falsehood in Imperial Russia). But wh\n\nThere are many unanswered questions out there. Many, many mysteries that will never be unraveled. But amongst those, the one that keeps me up at night is why was Grace's hair so crappy during the first season of Peaky Blinders ? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Peaky Blinders . I'm human, believe it or not. I've watched all its five seasons (twice) and I'm impatiently waiting for its sixth season with bated breath. And I can vouch for it: it's a quality show. Good storytelling, good acting, great photography... and for the most part, great character design both in costume design and hair and makeup. That's why I'm still baffled by the decision of having Grace's character sporting what amounts to limp California Beach Waves for the whole of the first season. Because, while it is true that the first season had a considerably lower budget than its following installments, a shitty approach to historical accuracy wasn't the general tone for the\n\n\"Beautiful things are fragile\" - Lucille Sharpe - Opposite Lucille stands our main character in the movie: Edith Cushing, a young and naive American with ambitions to become a writer. She meets and falls in love with a handsome and charming, but impoverished, English baronet: Sir Thomas Sharpe. They eventually marry and return to England, to the Sharpe's dilapidated mansion: Allerdale Hall. There they live with Thomas's sister: Lucille. The deadly apparitions that haunt the house will force Edith to slowly uncover the buried secrets of Crimson Peak. And so, Edith is to become a fragile butterfly caught in a moth's trap. PART II: THE BUTTERFLY Edith has considerably more frocks and gowns than Lucille does. It's only logical. Edith is our protagonist and, as such, has a bigger emotional arc throughout the movie, and she undergoes bigger changes. These are, in part, expressed through the costumes she wears and how these change throughout the mo\n\nPreviously in this blog, I talked about how the aesthetics of the Disney Princess Brand have changed through the different iterations of Cinderella (read here ). Since then, Disney hasn't stopped rehashing and remaking its old animated classics. On the contrary, it has doubled down on this business model and its remakes have become more common, more widespread, and more successful. Since the 2015 remake of Cinderella , Disney has remade The Jungle Book (April 2016), Beauty and the Beast (March 2017), Dumbo (March 2019), Aladdin (May 2019), The Lion King (July 2019), Lady and the Tramp (November 2019), Mulan (scheduled for release July 2020) and Cruella (scheduled for release May 2021). Remakes for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Pinocchio , The Little Mermaid , The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Bambi are in development. Clearly, the live-action remake has become a staple of the brand and it cannot be ignored. Unfortunately. Seeing that this industry trend will not go any\n\nThe spring of 2001 saw the release of Moulin Rouge! unexpectedly shake the movie industry and the box office simultaneously. Despite the many awards, including 8 nominations at the Academy Awards, and the impressive box office numbers, the movie quickly became very polarizing for audiences. Love and hate seemed to be the only two possible reactions to the movie itself. But that should not come as a surprise. The film was directed by Baz Luhrman, who has consistently been, throughout his career, one of the most polarizing filmmakers of his generation. I still have to meet anyone who simply doesn't mind his movies (which include Romeo+Juliet , Australia and The Great Gatsby ); it's either absolute love or absolute loathing. There is no middle ground with him. And that's mainly because he himself doesn't compromise when it comes to his style, which is so characteristic at this point (fast and frantic editing, vivid use of flashy colors and sparkle and stories a\n\nIt's been a while, but I always come back to her in the end. Padmé Amidala, from the Star Wars Prequels, is a Style Icon and my personal standout from the mess that Episode I to III ended up being. Because of it, I've decided it was time to finish what I started so long ago and finally address Episode III . It took me long enough. So let's dive back into it for one last chance to love, hate, snark and bark at the astonishing monstrosity that is Padmé's Wardrobe! A BRIEF REMINDER What are the Annexes? Well, the Annexes focus on all the costumes that were \"left behind\" in my selection of Padme Costumes for the A look into Star Wars: Padme's Dresses series. Here, I point out influences, likes, and dislikes, and anything that might feel relevant whilst digging into the gigantic wardrobe of this Galactic Queen. With this out of the way, let's go!
