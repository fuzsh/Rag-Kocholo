The picture was adapted from the play Caesar and Cleopatra (1901) by George Bernard Shaw, produced by Independent Producers and Pascal Film Productions and distributed by Eagle-Lion Distributors.\n\nUpon release, Caesar and Cleopatra failed to earn back its colossal budget. John Bryan was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction.[7]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAging Julius Caesar takes possession of the Egyptian capital city of Alexandria and tries to resolve a feud between the young princess Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy. Caesar develops a special relationship with Cleopatra and teaches her how to use her royal power.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVivien Leigh as Cleopatra\n\nClaude Rains as Caesar\n\nStewart Granger as Apollodorus\n\nFlora Robson as Ftatateeta\n\nFrancis L.

The production ran into delays because of wartime restrictions.[9] During the shoot, Vivien Leigh, who was pregnant, tripped and suffered a miscarriage. The incident triggered Leigh's manic depression, leading to her emotional breakdown, and halted production for five weeks.[1]\n\nThe film was described as a \"box office stinker\" at the time and almost ended Pascal's career. It was the first Shaw film made in colour, and the last film version of a Shaw play during his lifetime. After Shaw's death in 1950, Pascal produced Androcles and the Lion, another Shaw-derived film, in 1952.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to trade papers, the film was a \"notable box office attraction\" at British cinemas.[10][11] According to Kinematograph Weekly, the top British box-office draw for 1946 was The Wicked Lady.[12]\n\nThe film earned $1,363,371 in the United States, making it one of the more popular British films ever released there,[13] but the film's receipts fell short of initial expectations. Variety estimated that Rank lost $3 million (or $35.8 million at 2023 value) on the film after marketing, distribution, prints, insurance rights, and wages were taken into account.[3] Another account says the loss was £981,678.[14]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCultural depictions of Julius Caesar\n\nCultural depictions of Cleopatra VII\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nVermilye, Jerry.
