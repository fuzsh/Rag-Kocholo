        "text": "One of the most popular historic figures of all times was the ancient Egyptian queen Cleopatra. She was the last pharaoh of Egypt, who sought to defend her kingdom from the expanding Roman Empire.\n\nCleopatra lived roughly 2000-2100 years ago, between 69 and 30 BC, and she formed relationships with two of the Rome’s leaders – Julius Caesar, and later Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony). After Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius committed suicide, Egypt was absorbed into the Roman Empire.\n\nShe is considered one of the most influential and famous women who have ever lived, and one of the most important figures of the Ancient history.\n\nShe became so popular that there have been many movies about her through the history of cinematography. There is also the slot Cleopatra provided by International Game Technology, which you can play at Unibet, and don’t forget you can also enjoy a few slot games at stare gry hazardowe za darmo.\n\nIt was released in January 2012 and it has an RTP of 95.7%. It is one of the most popular slots online.\n\nThese films continue to make her a household name in the new age. She is a beautiful symbol of wisdom. If you love her too, why not customize a souvenir about her? Printing pins are suitable for this. Customize your favorite pictures or movie clips of her into printed pins that can be used not only as decorative items but also as a collection.\n\nHere are some of the most popular Cleopatra movies of all times:\n\nCleopatra (1963)\n\nThis is the most famous Cleopatra movie ever, with Elizabeth Taylor as the main actress. Richard Burton played Mark Antony and Rex Harrison was Julius Caesar. The list of cinema legends continues with director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who won four Oscars in his career. The movie is over 3 hours long and it was very well received, with four Oscars out of nine nominations.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra (1945)\n\nAfter winning the Oscar for the Best Leading Actress in “Gone with the Wind”, Vivien Leigh played Cleopatra in this movie 75 years ago. The Academy Awards nominee Claude Rains was Caesar, and this comedy-drama movie follows their interaction.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra (1972)\n\nAlmost 30 years later, Mark Antony also shared a movie with Cleopatra. Hollywood legend Charlton Heston, who already won an Oscar for “Ben-Hur” and featured in “Planet of the Apes” was director, writer and also the actor who played Mark Antony. This was basically his movie.\n\nCleopatra (1999, TV mini-series)\n\nThis more recent Cleopatra TV mini-series was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, and featured just two episodes. Former James Bond Timothy Dalton was Julius Caesar, while former “Titanic” actor Billy Zane was Mark Antony.\n\nCleopatra (1934)\n\nThis ‘30s movie about Cleopatra won one Oscar for best Cinematography, and the movie was shorter than the other regular historic movies – about one hour and 40 minutes. The French Claudette Colbert was at the height of her career when she played Cleopatra. In the same year, she won the Oscar for the Leading Actress in “It Happened One Night”.\n\nAsterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatre (2002)\n\nGerard Depardieu as Obelix and Christian Clavier as Asterix feature in this French adventure-comedy movie about Cleopatra. The Egyptian queen is played by Monica Bellucci. The movie is the most recent famous movie depiction of Cleopatra, which is helped by the two to have her palace built.\n\nAsterix et Cleopatre (1968)\n\nAnother French movie is the only famous animation about Cleopatra. Asterix and Obelix are set in the same quest for Egypt – to help her build a new summer home. Cleopatra and Julius Caesar made a bet on the project, and the Roman thinks that the new home cannot be completed in just few weeks.\n\nJulius Caesar (2004, TV mini-series)\n\nAlthough this mini-series is focused on Julius Caesar, it also features a young Cleopatra. Filled with many Italian actors, the TV mini-series has two very famous names in the cast. Richard Harris, who previously was twice nominated for the Oscar and played Marcus Aurelius in “Gladiator” and Albus Dumbledore in “Harry Potter”, is now Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Christopher Walken, who won an Oscar 25 years before the movie is Marcus Portius Cato."
