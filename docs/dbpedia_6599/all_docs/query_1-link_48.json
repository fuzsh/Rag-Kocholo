        "text": "For years the 1963 film Cleopatra had been considered one of the best film representations of the controversial Queen of Egypt with Elizabeth Taylor in the leading role. In 1999 ABC aired a two-part miniseries featuring an unknown Chilean actress named Leonor Varela in the leading role alongside former James Bond actor Timothy Dalton in the role as Ceasar and Billy Zane as Marc Antony.\n\nLike the original movie this one also begins with Ceasar coming to Egypt to settle the troubles in the country but here is where they differ. Arsinoe IV is actually present and currently the joint ruler of Egypt with her brother as she was historically and Pothinus is also present but since Ptolemy is so young, Arsinoe and Pothinus are running the country.\n\nMeanwhile in exile Cleopatra schemes to get back to Egypt and summons a courtesan to her to learn how to seduce a man and we all know the man she’s planning to seduce is Ceasar. Leonor’s Cleopatra also is smuggled into Egypt via carpet and makes her case for being the true ruler of Egypt, but she also is more seductive than Taylor’s version and the two of them sleep together. The next morning Ceasar announces that Cleopatra and Ptolemy will rule together and marry according to Egyptian custom even though he finds it distasteful because they are brother and sister. Leonor also seems to have more chemistry with Dalton’s Cesar than Elizabeth did with Rex Harrison’s Caesar. Arsinoe is furious and launches a full-scale attack on the city the Cesar holds off with two legions and in this version of the battle Cleopatra is actually in mortal danger because the palace is breached. Arsinoe and Ptolemy are hunted down. Ptolemy dies and Arsinoe is captured. Cleopatra wants her dead: he wants her alive is leverage. Later that night Cleopatra has her killed against his orders. Historically Arsinoe was taken to Greece and given sanctuary in a temple there until she was killed on Mark Antony and Cleopatra’s orders. Her murder in a sacred temple was just one of many acts the pair did that turned Romans against them.\n\nThis movie has Cleopatra enter Rome in secret and during the victory celebration Ceasar introduces her, but it is not the cheerful reception Liz Taylor’s Cleopatra got. Instead, the people are jeering at her and calling her Caesar’s whore while members of the Senate and Ceasar’s wife look on with delight. Cleopatra is angry and highly offended. Cleopatra then gets her revenge by making Ceasar publicly claim her son as his. There is also a statue erected of her in this film and it and him basically being declared a King are the deciding factors for the Senate to want him dead. In the original film Octavian is not aware of the plot, in this one he is and does not oppose it. Rupert Graves’s Octavian is more ruthless in this segment than MacDowell’s.\n\nCeasar’s death scene here is more brutal and he does not die at the foot of Pomey’s statue. Instead, he falls down the steps of the Senate where Antony, who had been attacked himself finds him and is clearly devastated. In the 1963 version he was distracted outside the Senate. Comparing the two scenes now, this one packs more of an emotional punch than the original through the performance of Billy Zane’s Anthony cradling Ceasar’s bloody body on the steps. There are as many beautiful sets and costumes as the 1963 version but the CGI kind of diminishes the beauty of the sets. I would give the edge on set design to the 1963 movie. As far as costuming design, both had beautiful costumes with the 1963 version having more glamourous ones. The acting edge when compared with the 1963 version goes to the cast of this one. They show far more emotion in their scenes than their 63 counterparts."
