        "text": "The myth of Cleopatra has made its way in modern times to a large number of films.The Internet Movie Data Base lists twenty nine. Few of them have anything to do with the historical personality of Cleopatra VII, last of the Ptolemaic line to rule Egypt. In fact, they are often more representative of the time in which the film was made than a reflection of historical fact.\n\nÂ\n\nThe earliest film treatments of the various stories associated with Cleopatra begin almost as early as motion pictures themselves. Helen Gardner and her acting company in 1912 made a silent \"Cleopatra\" that was not based on Shakespear's \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" or Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" but probably had its origins with Pushkin's short story \"Nights of Cleopatra.\" See IMDB listing. Stills of that production are hard to find although prints of the film exist. Later versions of the Cleopatra story are easier to document.\n\nÂ\n\nPoster for the Helen Gardner production with the caption\n\n\"The most beautiful motion picture ever made\"\n\nThe Theda Bara \"Cleopatra\" is lost but there are a number of still images preserved that can suggest the effect of the film. See IMDB listing or visit A Theda Bara Gallery with more stills from \"Cleopatra\""
