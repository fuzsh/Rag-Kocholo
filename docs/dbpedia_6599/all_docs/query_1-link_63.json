        "text": "Hello Film Club Members today is the 14th of December 2022 which also means its the fourteenth day of advent and the film that was chosen for me to write about was called Carry on Cleo which is all about The Romans who invade the wet and miserable Britain, and, among others, enslave the cowardly inventor whose name is Hegist, and the fearless warrior whose name is Horsa. In an attempt to kill the Roman Emperor Caesar at a Roman temple, Horsa kills Caesar's enemies, but Hengist gets all the credit, and is made by Caesar's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Mark Antony, Caesar's best friend, becomes besotted with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, but the only way to achieve his heart's desire is to kill Caesar and Hengist so that he can become the emperor along side Cleopatra. This review for the film Carry on Cleo has been given five stars which means I loved it because if you want a good laugh then I recommend you watch all of the Carry On Films because they are the best set of films to watch my favourite ones are Carry On Camping and Carry On Abroad. My Dad's favourite ones are Carry On Up the Khyber and Carry On Cabby. Thank you for reading my review on the film Carry On Cleo which was chosen by my sister Katie tomorrow's film is to be chosen by my mum Anita again so until then I hope you like the Carry On films as much as the Thomas family does we try and watch them every Christmas because they are always on at Christmas time.\n\nPrint this review"
