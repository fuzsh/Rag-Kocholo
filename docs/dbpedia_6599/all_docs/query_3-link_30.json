        "text": "When you hear Cleopatra mentioned, what image does the name invoke for you? For some, it’s Elizabeth Taylor, with glittering braids and blue eyeshadow that’s packed in up to her eyebrows. For others, it’s Jean-Léon Gérôme’s painting, Cleopatra and Caesar, in which the queen appears young, seductive, and scantily clad. These depictions thrust her romances with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony to the forefront, with her rule over Egypt falling by the wayside.\n\nIndeed, pop culture often portrays Cleopatra as a vamp, a charming woman who was born at the top and slept with two of Rome’s key players to remain there. However, what many don’t know is that the idea of the beautiful and savvy seductress that we commonly associate with Cleopatra is the result of Roman propaganda, which was carefully cultivated to reduce a brilliant ruler’s image. What’s worse—it worked.\n\nCleopatra VII Philopator was born in 69 BCE, a daughter of the Ptolemaic line, the family that had ruled Egypt for 300 years. They were the descendants of Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian general who had been a favorite of Alexander the Great’s. Raised in Alexandria, home of the famed lighthouse and the Great Library, Cleopatra was born into a bustling metropolis—and a powerful, untrustworthy family. This meant that Cleopatra had to learn at a young age how to successfully navigate fraught situations.\n\nRelated: 8 Historical Female Rulers Who Challenged the Status Quo\n\nCleopatra was an astute woman who spoke Koine Greek as her native language. She also took it upon herself to learn Egyptian, and was the first of the Ptolemaic line to bother to do so. Plutarch, a Greek historian, wrote that she spoke several languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, and Parthian. Plutarch also mentions that Cleopatra was not particularly beautiful, but was incredibly charming:\n\n“For her beauty, as we are told, was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her; but converse with her had an irresistible charm, and her presence…had something stimulating about it.”\n\nCleopatra was a savvy ruler, a charming conversationalist, and a polyglot. During her reign, she established trade with other nations, and heavily influenced Roman politics (for better or worse). She’s become an indelible part of public consciousness in a way that Caesar Augustus , one of her most outspoken adversaries, has failed to.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Cleopatra, her relationships with her family, and the society that preceded to allow her to rise to popularity and power in the way that she did, take a look at the books below."
