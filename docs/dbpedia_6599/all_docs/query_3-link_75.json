The latest Asterix movie is called Mission Cleopatra, but I prefer reading the books.\n\ninternet movie database Mission Cléopâtre\n\ninternet movie database Cleopatra (1963, Taylor & Burton)\n\nA picture explains more than words...\n\n1965\n\nDargaud\n\nCleopatra (as played by Elizabeth Taylor) enters Rome with her son by Julius Caesar on a large rolling sphinx, in a scene from the 1963 epic Cleopatra. www.corbis.com 1963\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nCleopatra is a historical epic film starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison (Julius Caesar) and Richard Burton (Mark Antony) and a host of other stars. Released in 1963, the film was a box office smash. Historically correct in most aspects, all the major characters are real. Although some liberties were taken with time and space, for the most part they really behaved as they are presented with the exception of Octavian, who is portrayed in a very negative light. He was actually a much better person than shown here, but then this is Cleopatra's movie after all. The film is divided into two halves. Part I deals with Cleopatra and Julius Caesar and Part II with Cleopatra and Mark Antony. www.historyinfilm.com/cleo/cleohome.htm"
