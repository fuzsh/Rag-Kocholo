Therefore, it does not license or charge permission fees for use of such material and cannot grant or deny permission to publish or otherwise distribute the material.\n\nUltimately, it is the researcher's obligation to assess copyright or other use restrictions and obtain permission from third parties when necessary before publishing or otherwise distributing materials found in the Library's collections.\n\nFor information about reproducing, publishing, and citing material from this collection, as well as access to the original items, see: Cartoon Drawings - Rights and Restrictions Information\n\nRights Advisory: No known restrictions on publication.\n\nReproduction Number: LC-USZC4-13650 (color film copy transparency)\n\nCall Number: CD 1 - Coffin (G.Y.), no. 27 (A size)\n\nAccess Advisory: ---\n\nObtaining Copies\n\nSome images in this collection are described in groups; others are described individually. In some cases, all of the images in the group display online, in other cases they do not.\n\nYou can download online images yourself. Alternatively, you can purchase copies of various types.\n\nDetermine whether the desired materials can be retrieved online.\n\nLook in the Medium field above to determine whether the description is for one photograph or more than one.\n\nIf the description is for a single item and it is displaying, you can download or purchase a print. Cite the number that begins with \"LC-DIG...\" when purchasing copies through Library of Congress Duplication Services.\n\nIf the description is for more than one item and there is a \"Click for more images\" icon displaying, select that. Individual images will display; you can download or purchase prints. Cite the number that begins with \"LC-DIG...\" when purchasing copies through Library of Congress Duplication Services.\n\nIf the description is for more than one item and there is no \"Click for more images\" icon displaying, return to the \"About this Item\" tab and select the \"Check for online items from this group\" link. Then select the \"Obtaining Copies\" tab for any retrieved items that are of interest.\n\nIf the images do not display online -- Select images for reproduction through one of these methods:\n\nVisit the Prints & Photographs Reading Room and request to view the group (general information about service in the reading room is available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/info/001_ref.html).\n\nP&P reading room staff can provide up to 15 photocopies of items per calendar year. (Color images cannot be photocopied.) For assistance, see our Ask a Librarian page. OR\n\nHire a freelance researcher to do further selection for you (a list of researchers is available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html).\n\nPurchasing Copies\n\nLibrary of Congress Duplication Services can make copies of various types from images in Prints & Photographs Division Collections. Price lists, contact information, and order forms are available on the Duplication Services Web site.\n\nCarol M. Highsmith sells prints of her photographs at: http://photographsamerica.com/ External .\n\nAccess to Originals\n\nPlease use the following steps to determine whether you need to fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.\n\nIs the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.)\n\nYes, the item is digitized. Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress. In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights restrictions.\n\nAs a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image is available. If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference librarian. (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see online where they are presented as positive images.)\n\nNo, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2.\n\nDo the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that a non-digital surrogate exists, such as microfilm or copy prints?\n\nYes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this surrogate.\n\nNo, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3.\n\nIf you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the same day or in the future. Reference staff can advise you in both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served."
