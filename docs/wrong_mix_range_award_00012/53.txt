Abstract

Gabriel Lippmann won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physics for his method of reproducing colors in photography. Despite the significance of this result, there are still misconceptions regarding the approach. We provide a complete end-to-end analysis of the process and show, both theoretically and experimentally, how the spectrum reflected from a Lippmann plate is not the same as the exposing spectrum. In addition, we demonstrate that, given the spectrum reflected from a Lippmann plate, together with the plate's color absorption properties, the original exposing spectrum can be algorithmically recovered.
