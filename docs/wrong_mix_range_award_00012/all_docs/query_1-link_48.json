This process captured an interference pattern in a photosensitive emulsion when multiple light waves interact.\n \nA glass plate was coated with light-sensitive film followed by pure mercury. When exposed, light rays struck the film and reflected back from the mercury.\n \nThe reflected waves interacted with the incoming and each other, causing interference patterns in the film. \n \nOnce exposed, the plate was developed, fixed, and dried. The result was a vibrant colour photograph that didn‚Äôt fade.\n \nThe method was hard to use and never came into widespread use, as photographs could not be duplicated. However, Lippmann‚Äôs method inspired more research on colour photography.\n \nThe image depicts one of Lippmann‚Äôs photographic plates. Each plate must be viewed from a specific angle to see its full image. \nCredit: Courtesy of @epflcampus and @photo.elysee\n\nDo you like taking photos?
