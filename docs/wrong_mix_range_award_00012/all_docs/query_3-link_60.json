        "text": "Marie Curie, originally named Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw, Poland on November 7, 1867.\n\nHer father was a professor of mathematics and physics. Her mother, a teacher, died of tuberculosis when Marie was only 12 years old.\n\nDespite her family’s poverty and the limited access she had to scientific education, combined with the fact that she was a woman, Marie overcome many obstacles to pursue her passion and her scientific career.\n\nMarie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice (in 1903 and in 1911). She is the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.\n\nShe was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. Beyond her Nobel Prize achievements, she was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris. In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.\n\nAmerican Friends of Institut Curie is the fund that allows US-based donors to support Institut Curie’s groundbreaking work with donations that are tax deductible to the extent allowed by US tax law.\n\nCancer has no borders. We need your support in the fight against cancer.\n\nTogether, let’s beat cancer!"
