Bjelkhagen Abstract Since the 1980s, there is a renewed interest in Gabriel Lippmann’s colour photography technique and several people around the world recording Lippmann photographs, especially holographers. The development of colour holography shows similarity to interference photography. The same type of panchromatic ultra-fine-grain silver halide material is used both for holography and Lippmann photography. A short review of the history of the technique is provided with a presentation of how modern Lippmann colour photographs can be recorded nowadays. A current advantage is the possibility of recording them without using mercury, making it safer and easier to practice the technique today. Examples of recently recorded interference colour photographs are illustrated with digital photographs. Keywords: interferential colour photography, colour holography, silver halide, emulsion, contemporary physics Introduction Few photographers today are familiar with the name Gabriel Lippmann (1845–1921), even fewer have seen a Lippmann colour photograph, but one hundred years ago, Lippmann was awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of interference photography. This was for his early colour technique exploiting the phenomenon of optical standing waves. Lippmann’s prize represents the only time this prestigious award has been given for a photographic invention. However, the process proved difficult and impractical , exposures ran into minutes, the colour were difficult to view and almost impossible to copy. Only a minority of photographers recorded successful Lippmann photographs. Those who did were skilled in making and coating their own emulsions and dedicated many years to the cultivation of the Hannouch,H.(ed.),GabrielLippmann’sColourPhotography:Science,Media,Museums.Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2022 doi 10.5117/9789463728553_ch11 274 Hans I. Bjelkhagen technique. Original examples of this extremely rare, exotic and arcane medium number around five hundred specimens worldwide. Attempts at commercialisation floundered and by the time Lippmann was awarded his prize the more practical autochrome plates had become available. Despite the difficulties, Lippmann’s photography remains, to this day, the only direct process of true colour photography known. It is a technique of exquisite beauty, both technically and aesthetically. The ultra-fine-grain plates, essential to the medium, display the highest photographic resolution ever achieved. The encoding of colour, as a periodic volume diffraction grating of colloidal silver offers excellent and unrivalled archival longevity. Today there is a renewal interest in the technique and several people around the world record Lippmann photographs. It started in the late 1980s with several papers being published. The development of holography, in particular colour holography, has opened possibilities to study and record Lippmann photography. The same panchromatic ultra-finegrain silver halide material is used both for holography and Lippmann photography. History of Lippmann Photography Gabriel Lippmann (1845–1921), professor of mathematical physics at the Sorbonne invented, demonstrated and mathematically formulated the process of interference colour photography, also known as interferential photography, or Lippmann photography, in the years 1891–1894. (Lippmann 1891, 1892a, 1892b). Lippmann’s process was the first exploitation of optical standing waves for the direct recording of permanent colour realised after some twelve years of experimentation. Lippmann photography is the only imaging technique (theoretically) that can directly record the entire colour spectrum of an object or scene. The process exploits the formation of standing light waves, by means of a mirror, and records these in a single-layer, panchromatic, ultra-fine-grain, black-and-white photographic emulsion. When illuminated with white light, the recorded interference fringes select and reflect the original colours registered in the image, and these construct, by Bragg diffraction, the colours of the original scene. The principle of Lippmann photography is explained in this way: An ordinary plate camera is used to form an image on the photographic recording plate. But the plate is loaded backwards with the emulsion side placed away from the lens and in optical contact with a mirror of mercury. The incident [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-07-24 04:02 GMT) Modern Lippmann Photography 275 light waves interfere with their own reflections forming a standing wave pattern within the volume of the emulsion, with a periodic spacing of λ/(2n) that has to be resolved and recorded (λ is the wavelength of light in air and n is the refractive index of the emulsion). The colour information is stored locally in this way. The larger the separation between the fringes, the longer is the wavelength of the recorded light. When the developed photograph is viewed in white light, different parts of the recorded image produce different colours. This..."
