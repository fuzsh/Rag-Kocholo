Biography

Abstract

Gabriel Lippmann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 "for his method of reproducing colours photographically based on the phenomenon of interference." Throughout his career as a physicist, he contributed to various areas of the field, such as astronomy, thermodynamics, and photochemistry. He developed instruments to aid his work, such as the sensitive capillary electrometer, the coelostat, and a galvanometer.

August 16, 1845Birth, Hollerich (Luxembourg, Luxembourg).

1858Began studies at the Lycée Napoléon (Henry IV College), Paris (France).

1868Admitted to École Normale Supérieure, Paris (France).

1873Given scientific mission by French government to work alongside scholars as research assistant, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg (Germany).
