        "text": "Capital of Tamil Nadu, India\n\n\"Madras\" redirects here. For other uses, see Madras (disambiguation).\n\nThis article is about the city. For its eponymous district, see Chennai district. For other uses, see Chennai (disambiguation).\n\nMegacity in Tamil Nadu, India\n\nChennai ( , Tamil: [ˈt͡ɕenːaɪ̯], IAST: Cennaī), formerly known as Madras,[b] is the capital city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India. It is the state's primate city and is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration. Incorporated in 1688, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in India and the second oldest in the world after London.\n\nHistorically, the region was part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms during various eras. The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Chennapa Nayaka in the 17th century. The British garrison established the Madras city and port and built Fort St. George, the first British fortress in India. The city was made the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. After India gained independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996.\n\nThe city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area,[c] the 35th-largest urban area in the world by population and one of the largest metropolitan economies of India. Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy and the third-largest expatriate population in India. As a gateway to South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities ranking 36th among the most-visited cities in the world in 2019. Ranked as a beta-level city in the Global Cities Index, Chennai regularly features among the best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest cities in India.\n\nChennai is a major centre for medical tourism and is termed \"India's health capital\". Chennai houses a major portion of India's automobile industry, hence the name \"Detroit of India\". It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among National Geographic's \"Top 10 food cities\" in 2015 and ranked ninth on Lonely Planet's best cosmopolitan cities in the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major film production centre and home to the Tamil-language film industry.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Chennai was derived from the name of Chennappa Nayaka, a Nayak ruler who served as a general under Venkata Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire from whom the British East India Company acquired the town in 1639.[11][12] The first official use of the name was in August 1639 in a sale deed to Francis Day of the East India Company.[13] A land grant was given to the Chennakesava Perumal Temple in Chennapatanam later in 1646, which some scholars argue to be the first use of the name.[14][11]\n\nThe name Madras is of native origin, and has been shown to have been in use before the British established a presence in India.[15] A Vijayanagara-era inscription found in 2015 was dated to the year 1367 and mentions the port of Mādarasanpattanam, along with other small ports on the east coast, and it was theorized that the aforementioned port is the fishing port of Royapuram.[16] Madras might have been derived from Madraspattinam, a fishing village north of Fort St. George but it is uncertain whether the name was in use before the arrival of Europeans.[17]\n\nIn July 1996, the Government of Tamil Nadu officially changed the name from Madras to Chennai.[18] The name \"Madras\" continues to be used occasionally for the city as well as for places or things named after the city in the past.[19]\n\nHistory\n\nStone Age implements have been found near Pallavaram in Chennai and according to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Pallavaram was a megalithic cultural establishment, and pre-historic communities resided in the settlement.[20] The region around Chennai was an important administrative, military, and economic centre for many centuries. During the 1st century CE, Tamil poet named Thiruvalluvar lived in the town of Mylapore, a neighbourhood of present-day Chennai.[21] The region was part of Tondaimandalam which was ruled by the Early Cholas in the 2nd century CE by subduing Kurumbas, the original inhabitants of the region.[22] Pallavas of Kanchi became independent rulers of the region from 3rd to 9th century CE and the areas of Mahabalipuram and Pallavaram were built during the reign of Mahendravarman I.[23] In 879, Pallavas were defeated by the Later Cholas led by Aditya I and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan later brought the region under the Pandya rule in 1264.[22] The region came under the influence of Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century CE.[24][22]\n\nThe Portuguese arrived in 1522 and built a port named São Tomé after the Christian apostle, St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached in the area between 52 and 70 CE. In 1612, the Dutch established themselves near Pulicat, north of Chennai.[25] On 20 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company along with the Nayak of Kalahasti Chennappa Nayaka met with the Vijayanager Emperor Peda Venkata Raya at Chandragiri and obtained a grant for land on the Coromandel coast on which the company could build a factory and warehouse for their trading activities.[26] On 22 August, he secured the grant for a strip of land about 9.7 km (6 mi) long and 1.6 km (1 mi) inland in return for a yearly sum of five hundred lakh pagodas.[27][28] The region was then formerly a fishing village known as \"Madraspatnam\".[25] A year later, the company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India, which became the nucleus of the growing colonial city and urban Chennai.[29][30]\n\nIn 1746, Fort St. George and the town were captured by the French under General La Bourdonnais, the Governor of Mauritius, who plundered the town and its outlying villages.[25] The British regained control in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and strengthened the town's fortress wall to withstand further attacks from the French and Hyder Ali, the king of Mysore.[31] They resisted a French siege attempt in 1759.[32] In 1769, the city was threatened by Hyder Ali during the First Anglo-Mysore War with the Treaty of Madras ending the conflict.[33] By the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital.[34]\n\nThe city became a major naval base and became the central administrative centre for the British in South India.[35] The city was the baseline for the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, which was started on 10 April 1802.[36] With the advent of railways in India in the 19th century, the city was connected to other major cities such as Bombay and Calcutta, promoting increased communication and trade with the hinterland.[37]\n\nAfter India gained its independence in 1947, the city became the capital of Madras State, the predecessor of the current state of Tamil Nadu.[38] The city was the location of the hunger strike and death of Potti Sreeramulu which resulted in the formation of Andhra State in 1953 and eventually the re-organization of Indian states based on linguistic boundaries in 1956.[39][40]\n\nIn 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which marked a major shift in the political dynamics of the city and eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi.[41][42] On 17 July 1996, the city was officially renamed from Madras to Chennai, in line with then a nationwide trend to using less Anglicised names.[43] On 26 December 2004, a tsunami lashed the shores of Chennai, killing 206 people in Chennai and permanently altering the coastline.[44] The 2015 Chennai Floods submerged major portions of the city, killing 269 people and resulting in damages of ₹86.4 billion (US$1 billion).[45]\n\nEnvironment\n\nGeography\n\nMain article: Geography of Chennai\n\nChennai is located on the southeastern coast of India in the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu on a flat coastal plain known as the Eastern Coastal Plains with an average elevation of 6.7 m (22 ft) and highest point at 60 m (200 ft).[46][47] Chennai's soil is mostly clay, shale and sandstone.[48] Clay underlies most of the city with sandy areas found along the river banks and coasts where rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. Certain areas in South Chennai have a hard rock surface.[49][50] As of 2018, the city had a green cover of 14.9 per cent, with a per capita green cover of 8.5 square metres against the World Health Organization recommendation of nine square metres.[51]\n\nAs of 2017 , water bodies cover an estimated 3.2 km2 (1.2 sq mi) area of the city.[52] Two major rivers flow through Chennai, the Cooum River (or Koovam) through the centre and the Adyar River to the south.[53] A section of the Buckingham Canal built in 1877-78, runs parallel to the Bay of Bengal coast, linking the two rivers.[54] Kosasthalaiyar River traverses through the northern fringes of the city before draining into the Bay of Bengal, at Ennore Creek.[55] The Otteri Nullah, an east–west stream, runs through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at Basin Bridge.[56] The groundwater table in Chennai is at 4–5 m (13–16 ft) below ground level on average and is replenished mainly by rainwater.[57] Of the 24.87 km (15.45 mi) coastline of the city, 3.08 km (1.91 mi) experiences erosion, with sand accretion along the shoreline at the Marina beach and the area between the Ennore Port and Kosasthalaiyar river.[58]\n\nGeology\n\nChennai is situated in Seismic Zone III, indicating a moderate risk of damage from earthquakes.[59] Owing to the tectonic zone the city falls in, the city is considered a potential geothermal energy site. The crust has old granite rocks dating back nearly a billion years indicating volcanic activities in the past with expected temperatures of 200–300 °C (392–572 °F) at 4–5 km (2.5–3.1 mi) depth.[60]\n\nClimate\n\nChennai has a dry-summer tropical wet and dry climate which is designated As under the Köppen climate classification.[61] The city lies on the thermal equator and as it is also located on the coast, there is no extreme variation in seasonal temperature.[62] The hottest time of the year is from April to June with an average temperature of 35–40 °C (95–104 °F).[63] The highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 31 May 2003.[64] The coldest time of the year is in December–January, with average temperature of 19–25 °C (66–77 °F) and the lowest recorded temperature of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) on 11 December 1895 and 29 January 1905.[65]\n\nChennai receives most of its rainfall from the northeast monsoon between October and December while smaller amounts of rain come from the southwest monsoon between June and September. The average annual rainfall is about 120 cm (47 in).[66] The highest annual rainfall recorded was 257 cm (101 in) in 2005.[67] Prevailing winds in Chennai are usually southwesterly between April and October and northeasterly during the rest of the year.[68] The city relies on the annual monsoon rains to replenish water reservoirs.[69] Cyclones and depressions are common features during the season.[70] Water inundation and flooding happen in low-lying areas during the season with significant flooding in 2015 and 2023.[71]\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nA protected estuary on the Adyar River forms a natural habitat for several species of birds and animals.[78] Chennai is also a popular city for birding with more than 130 recorded species of birds have been recorded in the city.[79] Marshy wetlands such as Pallikaranai and inland lakes also host a number of migratory birds during the monsoon and winter.[80][81] The southern stretch of Chennai's coast from Tiruvanmiyur to Neelangarai are favoured by the endangered olive ridley sea turtles to lay eggs every winter.[82] Guindy National Park is a protected area within the city limits and wildlife conservation and research activities take place at Arignar Anna Zoological Park.[83] Madras Crocodile Bank Trust is a herpetology research station, located 40 km (25 mi) south of Chennai.[84][85] The city's tree cover is estimated to be around 64.06 km2 (24.73 sq mi) with 121 recorded species belonging to 94 genera and 42 families. Major species include Copper pod, Indian beech, Gulmohar, Raintree, Neem, and Tropical Almond.[86] The city's marine and inland water bodies house a number of fresh water and salt water fishes, and marine organisms.[87][88]\n\nEnvironmental issues\n\nChennai had many lakes spread across the city, but urbanization has led to the shrinkage of water bodies and wetlands.[89][90] The water bodies have shrunk from an estimated 12.6 km2 (4.9 sq mi) in 1893 to 3.2 km2 (1.2 sq mi) in 2017.[52] The number of wetlands in the city has decreased from 650 in 1970 to 27 in 2015.[91] Nearly half of the native plant species in the city's wetlands have disappeared with only 25 per cent of the erstwhile area covered with aquatic plants still viable.[92] The major water bodies including the Adyar, Cooum and Kosathaliyar rivers, and the Buckingham canal are heavily polluted with effluents and waste from domestic and commercial sources.[93][94][53] The encroachment of urban development on wetlands has hampered the sustainability of water bodies and was a major contributor to the floods in 2015 and 2023 and water scarcity crisis in 2019.[95][96]\n\nThe Chennai River Restoration Trust set up by the government of Tamil Nadu is working on the restoration of the Adyar River.[97] The Environmentalist Foundation of India is a volunteering group working towards wildlife conservation and habitat restoration.[98][99]\n\nDemographics\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Chennai and Religion in Chennai\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%16397,000— 164619,000+171.4%167040,000+110.5%1681200,000+400.0%1685300,000+50.0%1691400,000+33.3%1715100,000−75.0%1726100,000+0.0%1733100,000+0.0%1791300,000+200.0%1871367,552+22.5%1881405,848+10.4%1891452,518+11.5%1901509,346+12.6%1911518,660+1.8%1921526,911+1.6%1931647,232+22.8%1941777,481+20.1%19511,416,056+82.1%19611,729,141+22.1%19712,469,449+42.8%19813,266,034+32.3%19913,841,396+17.6%20014,343,645+13.1%20116,748,026+55.4%Source:\n\n1639–1791:[100]\n\n1871–1901:[101]\n\n1871–1931:[102]\n\n1931–1951:[103]\n\n1951–1961:[104]\n\n1991–2001:[105]\n\n2001:[106]\n\n2011:[9]\n\nA resident of Chennai is called a Chennaite.[107][108] According to 2011 census, the city had a population of 4,646,732, within an area of 174 km2 (67 sq mi).[109] Post expansion of the city to 426 km2 (164 sq mi), the Chennai Municipal Corporation was renamed as Greater Chennai Corporation and the population including the new city limits as per the 2011 census was 6,748,026.[9][4][110] As of 2019 , 40 per cent of the 1.788 million families in the city live below the poverty line.[111] As of 2017 , the city had 2.2 million households, with 40 per cent of the residents not owning a house.[112] There are about 1,131 slums in the city housing more than 300,000 households.[113]\n\nAdministration and politics\n\nAdministration\n\nMain article: Administration of Chennai\n\nThe city is governed by the Greater Chennai Corporation (formerly \"Corporation of Madras\"), which was established on 29 September 1688. It is the oldest surviving municipal corporation in India and the second oldest surviving corporation in the world.[114] In 2011, the jurisdiction of the Chennai Corporation was expanded from 174 km2 (67 sq mi) to an area of 426 km2 (164 sq mi), divided into three regions North, South and Central covering 200 wards.[115][116] The corporation is headed by a mayor, elected by the councillors, who are elected through a popular vote by the residents.[117][118]\n\nThe Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is the nodal agency responsible for the planning and development of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, which is spread over an area of 1,189 km2 (459 sq mi), covering the Chennai district and parts of Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu districts.[119] The metropolitan area consists of four municipal corporations, 12 municipalities and other smaller panchayats.[5][120]\n\nAs the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu, the city houses the state executive and legislative headquarters primarily in the secretariat buildings in Fort St George.[121] Madras High Court is the highest judicial authority in the state, whose jurisdiction extends across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.[122]\n\nLaw and order\n\nThe Greater Chennai Police (GCP) is the primary law enforcement agency in the city and is headed by a commissioner of police.[123] The Greater Chennai Police is a division of the Tamil Nadu Police, the administrative control of which lies with the Home ministry of the Government of Tamil Nadu.[124][125] Greater Chennai Traffic Police (GCTP) is responsible for the traffic management in the city.[126] The metropolitan suburbs are policed by the Chennai Metropolitan Police, headed by the Chennai Police Commissionerate, and the outer district areas of the CMDA are policed by respective police departments of Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts.[127]\n\nAs of 2021 , Greater Chennai had 135 police stations across four zones with 20,000 police personnel.[128][129] As of 2021 , the crime rate in the city was 101.2 per hundred thousand people.[130] In 2009, Madras Central Prison, the major prison and one of the oldest in India was demolished with the prisoners moved to the newly constructed Puzhal Central Prison.[131]\n\nPolitics\n\nWhile the major part of the city falls under three parliamentary constituencies (Chennai North, Chennai Central and Chennai South), the Chennai metropolitan area is spread across five constituencies. It elects 28 MLAs to the state legislature.[132][133] Being the capital of the Madras Province that covered a large area of the Deccan region, Chennai remained the centre of politics during the British colonial era.

V. Ramaswamy emerged in Madras.[140] Congress dominated the political scene post Independence in the 1950s and 1960s under C. Rajagopalachari and later K. Kamaraj.[141] The Anti-Hindi agitations led to the rise of Dravidian parties with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) forming the first government under C. N. Annadurai in 1967. In 1972, a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran. The two Dravidian parties continue to dominate electoral politics, the national parties usually aligning as junior partners to the two major Dravidian parties.[142][143] Many film personalities became politicians and later chief ministers, including C. N. Annadurai, M. Karunanidhi, M. G.
