        "text": "The legendary figure in Indian sports won several top honours in his career.\n\nMahesh Bhupathi is regarded as one of the best doubles players in the sport of tennis. He is counted among India’s greatest tennis players along with the likes of Leander Paes. Infact, the partnership between the two remains one of the most iconic ones in the sport.\n\nThe tennis star had a long career, one full of major honours. He also earned a lot of national recognition and continues to inspire the upcoming generation of tennis players through his academy.\n\nLooking back at his illustrious career, Mahesh Bhupathi has a long list of achievements. However, five of the following major achievements really define the legend that is Bhupathi. Here are the five most iconic achievements of his career:\n\n5. Olympic semi-finalist\n\nMahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes almost created history during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The pair reached the semi-final stage of the Men’s Doubles circuit but ended up on the losing side.\n\nThe pair initially lost the semi-finals to German pair Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuttler. The third-place contest saw the Indians concede defeat to Croatian pair Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubicic. Despite narrowly missing out on securing an iconic Olympic medal, the feat of reaching the third-place match was impressive by Bhupathi alongside Paes.\n\n4. Grand Slams in Men’s Doubles\n\nAs mentioned, Mahesh Bhupathi is one of the most decorated doubles players in the history of the sport. Mahesh Bhupathi won all three of Wimbledon, French Open and the US Open at one point in his career. He secured the French Open twice in 1999 and 2001.\n\nThe Indian won the Wimbledon in 1999 and the US Open in 2002. Bhupathi missed out on the Australian Open however, despite reaching the final in 1999, 2009 and 2011. The title eluded him from obtaining a career grand slam in Men’s Doubles.\n\n3. Five-time ATP Tour finalist\n\nReaching the tour-end ATP finals is a major achievement. One has to perform consistently throughout the year to ensure qualification into the finals. The tournament is contested by the best of the best from that particular year and Bhupathi has played in ATP Tour Finals five times.\n\nThe 46-year-old reached the finals in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2010 and 2012. He played alongside partners like Leander Paes, Max Mirnyi, Mark Knowles and Rohan Bopanna. Unfortunately, he never managed to win the year-end finals.\n\n2. Career Grand Slam in Mixed Doubles\n\nThe career grand slam in the Mixed Doubles circuit is one of the major achievements of Bhupathi’s career. To win one grand slam is a major achievement, but to win all of them is a class apart feat. Bhupathi went a step further and secured the career grand slam twice. He secured the Australian Open in 2006 and 2009.\n\nThe Indian won the French Open in 1997 and 2012, the Wimbledon in 2002 and 2005 and the US Open in 1999 and 2005 respectively. Interestingly, Bhupathi partnered compatriot Sania Mirza to win the Australian Open in 2009 and the French Open in 2012.\n\n1. National Awards\n\nMahesh Bhupathi is regarded as one of India’s all time-greatest tennis players. The legendary figure has inspired countless upcoming tennis enthusiasts who aim to score big in the sport. The Government of India has recognised the achievements and his service to the nation through representation in the field of sports.\n\nBhupathi earned the Arjuna Award in lawn tennis in 1995 as an upcoming young player. Fast forward, he won the Padma Shri award in 2001, the fourth-highest civilian award in India for his commitment to the nation."
