        "text": "New Delhi:\n\nActress Lara Dutta and ace tennis champion Mahesh Bhupathi's six-year-old daughter Saira is most likely to follow her father's footsteps. The young tennis player was photographed during a practice session in Mumbai on Thursday and her father Mahesh Bhupathi was also present at the tennis court with her. Saira was seen practicing some beginners' tennis moves and Mahesh Bhupathi was by her side as the coach. Little Saira was dressed in a black sleeveless tee and a rainbow coloured skirt and she looked absolutely adorable on the court. Here are photos from Saira and Mahesh Bhupathi's photos from the tennis practice session:\n\nLara Dutta, a former Miss Universe, married tennis champ Mahesh Bhupathi on February 16, 2011. The couple opted for a simple wedding ceremony, which was followed by a grand reception later. Lara Dutta and Mahesh Bhupathi welcomed Saira - their first child - in January 2012. Lara Dutta often delights her Instafam with adorable pictures of the little munchkin.\n\nTake a look at some of the photos here:\n\nSpeaking at a an event in Mumbai earlier this year, Lara Dutta had said that her daughter Saira has been her life's \"greatest teacher\". \"My daughter has been literally my life's greatest teacher and she has pushed all the limits as (far as) possible because she is at that age right now. She is pushing it how far it can go before mom erupts, but it is fun and wonderful. Mahesh has been a wonderful and hands-on dad.\""
