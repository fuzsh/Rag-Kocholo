The over-the-top (OTT) platform has partnered with award-winning filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and Nitesh Tiwari to create the sports docu-drama based on the on-court and off-court relationship of these two sporting legends.\n\nThe duo dropped a hint of the ‘Break Point’ on July 4 through a Twitter banter. Coincidently, this also marked the 22nd anniversary of their iconic Wimbledon win in 1999.\n\nThe latest docu-series will narrate the story of the duo’s friendship, passion for the sport, the intricacies of their relationships and the strains on it in the context of unparalleled success. The duo was one of the most feared doubles pairs back in the 1990s, and were top ranked in the year 1999.\n\n“Our 20-year journey has been a sensitive mix of achievement, conflict, success, disappointments, and friendship. There is no one better to document this than Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and Nitesh Tiwari. I look forward to seeing this unfold on ZEE5”, said Bhupathi.\n\nMeanwhile, Paes added, “I'm really excited to share our story with everyone. There's been a lot of talk about Leander and Mahesh over the years, but the idea of inspiring the next generation, and sharing the moments with those who have supported us through the years, by telling our story, is what persuaded me to say yes to Break Point.”\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nIndia's apex court says Delhi government can seek information from Facebook regarding its alleged role in the riots that rocked India's capital last year\n\nChina’s crypto crackdown is not likely to stop with Bitcoin mining — stablecoins, software, influencers are also on its radar\n\nOnePlus confirms slowing down popular apps on OnePlus 9, 9 Pro"
