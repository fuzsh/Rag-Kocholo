        "text": "Of our 45 presidents, five have visited Pomona during their time in office, from Benjamin Harrison in 1891 to Barack Obama in 2009. Possibly the shortest such visit was by William McKinley.\n\nI decided to look into this after rereading a history column of mine written days before Obama’s visit. I had details about the stops by Harrison, William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover, researched for me by the Pomona Public Library’s Special Collections department, but nothing about McKinley’s, which took place May 7, 1901.\n\nHistory columnist Joe Blackstock didn’t know anything about it either, but the other day he found an article for me in the Los Angeles Times about the stop. McKinley was evidently traveling from Redlands to Los Angeles that day.\n\nAt 10:30 a.m., a telegram was received in Pomona that the presidential train would stop at Pomona’s Southern Pacific depot at 1 p.m.\n\nThe news quickly spread via telephone, word of mouth and handbills, the Facebook of its day. Decorations, including a large portrait of the president, were hastily put up. By 1 p.m., some 3,500 people from Pomona and surrounding cities had congregated around the depot.\n\n“Precisely on schedule time the Chief Magistrate’s special steamed in amid the wildest cheering,” the Times reported.\n\nUnfortunately, the story cut off shortly afterward in mid-sentence. Who says copy editing mistakes are a modern problem? But the library’s Allan Lagumbay turned up a somewhat embittered local account in the Pomona Weekly Times.\n\n“The stop was too short, shorter than was reasonable under the circumstances — surely less than a minute and a half. Had five minutes been given, ample time would have been left to reach Los Angeles at 3:30, the schedule time,” the Weekly Times groused.\n\nThe account continued: “A speech of even one minute would have been received with much favor; no matter what he might have said, the people would have been better satisfied and would have remembered the leader longer. He shook hands with many children who crowded about the rear, and began to speak just as the train moved away.”\n\nHang on. Full stop.\n\nThe president of the United States was starting to address a crowd from the rear of his train when the train slowly began leaving the station? Ha ha ha!\n\nDid any bystanders shoot video on their hand-crank telephone?\n\nAnyway, there’s no particular reason to present this piece of history today, I admit. But given that some Presidents Day sales are still going on, let’s consider this a belated Presidents Day column item and, like McKinley’s train, move on.\n\nCulture Corner\n\n• 1970s photos of singer Claudia Lennear, the Pomona woman who was featured in the documentary “20 Feet From Stardom” and who served as a muse for Mick Jagger and David Bowie, will be on exhibit at the Garner House, 840 N. Indian Hill Blvd. in Claremont’s Memorial Park, courtesy of Claremont Heritage. The exhibit of photos by Norman Seeff opens from 6 to 9 p.m. Saturday with a reception. Lennear will perform an acoustic set at 7 p.m. in the courtyard. Admission is free.\n\n• Author Viet Thanh Nguyen will be in conversation with Mai Elliott at 2 p.m. Saturday onstage at Pitzer College’s Benson Auditorium, 1050 N. Mills Ave., Claremont. Nguyen, a Pulitzer winner, will talk about his collection of linked short stories, “The Refugees,” set in Vietnam and the United States. Elliott, a historian from Claremont, was in Ken Burns’ “The Vietnam War” series. The event culminates the Friends of the Claremont Library‘s On the Same Page community read for “The Refugees.” Admission is free.\n\n• The under-construction new home for the Pomona College Museum of Art got a boost with a $15 million donation from alumna and trustee Janet Inskeep Benton. The $44 million facility, set to be completed this fall and to open in 2020, will be known as the Benton Museum of Art.\n\nValley Vignette\n\nLiliana Andriani came here from her native Colombia in the 1980s, starting a jewelry repair booth at the Pomona Swap Meet before opening Angel Jewelers in Rancho Cucamonga in 1989 while taking English as a Second Language classes at Chaffey College. She’s now on the board of the Chamber of Commerce and supports such nonprofits as OPARC, Foothill Family Shelter, Hope Through Housing and Growing Pains. On Monday, she’ll be honored in Sacramento by state Sen. Mike Morrell as his 32nd District’s Woman of the Year.\n\nDavid Allen is the man of Friday, Sunday and Wednesday.
