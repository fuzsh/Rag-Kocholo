        "text": "CZOLGOSZ, LEON F. (1873-29 Oct. 1901), the assassin of Pres. Wm. McKinley, was born in Detroit to Polish immigrants. The family settled in Cleveland in 1891. With less than 6 years of schooling, Czolgosz found work in the Newburgh Wire Mill in 1891, participated in a failed strike in 1893, and subsequently grew bitter toward RELIGION and capitalism, quit the mill in 1898, and did not work again. Czolgosz attempted to join the Liberty Club, a local anarchist group, but its leaders did not trust him. He apparently got the idea of shooting McKinley after reading of an anarchist's assassination of King Humbert I of Italy in 1900, although he later claimed a speech by noted anarchist Emma Goldman delivered at Cleveland's FRANKLIN CLUB in May 1901 incited him.\n\nKnowing through advertisements that McKinley would visit the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in Sept. 1901, Czolgosz left Cleveland in mid-1901 and on 31 Aug. rented a room in Buffalo. On 6 Sept., among a crowd waiting for the president in the exposition's Temple of Music, Czolgosz, who had concealed a revolver under a handkerchief wrapped about his hand, fired twice, hitting the president in the breastbone and abdomen. He was captured immediately. McKinley died of the abdominal wound 8 days later. Czolgosz was tried by the Supreme Court of the State of New York and found guilty of murder in 2 days. He was electrocuted at the Auburn (N.Y.) State Prison on 29 Oct. 1901 and buried in an unmarked grave on the prison grounds."
