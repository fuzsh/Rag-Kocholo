        "text": "With their national conventions completed, the Republican and Democratic parties are girding their loins to do battle for the White House in November. Since California is generally not considered a battleground state, it is unlikely that Sens. Obama, McCain and Biden or Gov. Palin will find time in their schedules to make a campaign appearance in Redlands.\n\nThe only “top-of-the-ticket” candidate to have campaigned in Redlands remains Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp in 1996. On Oct. 29 of that year, the former congressman and Buffalo Bills quarterback held a brief rally for several hundred supporters (and a handful of protesters) in front of the Lincoln Memorial Shrine.\n\nA couple of factors apparently went into Kemp’s decision. First was Redlands’ well-earned reputation for being a reliable source of Republican votes. Even in the Democratic landslide years of 1936 and 1964, Redlands went strongly for Republican candidates Alf Landon and Barry Goldwater.\n\nSecond was Kemp’s personal interest in Abraham Lincoln, having spoken about the Great Emancipator at several Lincoln and Civil War gatherings.\n\nAs curator of the Lincoln Shrine, I was asked by campaign officials to give the candidate a brief tour of the museum before his speech. Brief was the operative word, as the candidate, eager to address the waiting crowd which had seen him alight from his bus and enter the building, cut short my tour after about 90 seconds. Kemp then gave his standard stump speech, praising the power of tax cuts and lambasting Clintonian corruption, followed by his signature hurling of a football into the crowd.\n\nMy other strong memory of that day was the disproportionate interest shown by the crowd in one of the members of Dole’s entourage, Hollywood actress Bo Derek.\n\nAlthough it wasn’t a campaign appearance, things were different when President William McKinley became the first president to visit Redlands in May 1901. Elected in 1896 as a result of popular discontent with the Democrats’ handling of the economy, McKinley would oversee an era of American expansionism abroad that would culminate in the Spanish-American War. The overwhelming United States victory in that short-lived conflict would contribute greatly to McKinley’s easy re-election in 1900.\n\nIn the spring of 1901 the popular president announced plans to tour the West by train. The adolescent community of Redlands, having been incorporated just 13 years before, was eager to be included in the destination list. Thanks to the Republican political connections of the Redlands Board of Trade, in particular mining millionaire A.G. Hubbard, not only did Redlands make the cut but it was also selected as the location for the official “Welcome to California” ceremony to be hosted by Gov. Henry Gage.\n\nRedlanders went all out to insure that the president and the governor would be impressed. Individual homes and businesses attempted to outdo each other with patriotic bunting and floral displays. The Board of Trade (today housing Joe Greensleeves restaurant) was adorned with large letters made of oranges spelling out “Welcome to Our President.”\n\nThe YMCA felt obligated to explain in the newspaper the lack of decoration on their building, blaming it on miscommunication and the fact that every yard of patriotic bunting in Redlands had been bought up. Orange Street from Citrus Avenue to the Casa Loma Hotel at Colton Avenue (today the location of Stater Bros.) was strewn with thousands of roses. Flags were suspended from the trolley car wires every eight feet and a grand triumphal double-arch was erected at the intersection of State and Orange.\n\nAccording to the Redlands Daily Facts’ effusive account of the day, the massive arch was festooned with pepper boughs, fan palm leaves, strings of oranges and grapefruits, 1,500 carnations and an unknown amount of roses, lilies and geraniums. Hanging underneath the top of the arch was a reproduction Liberty Bell, from which were suspended four ropes of roses and sweetpeas, reaching to the base, where four young women were deployed in order to ring the bell as the president passed beneath.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times described it as “a thing of tremendous beauty, and as intricate as it was striking.” A smaller arch was erected in Smiley Park and a banner stretching over Eureka Street proclaimed “Welcome to the Representatives of the Republic Destined to Encircle the Globe.”\n\nAll was in readiness when the eight-car presidential train pulled into the Southern Pacific depot on Orange Street (roughly located on the site of today’s Kinko’s parking lot) at 9 on the morning of May 8. In addition to McKinley and his wife, Ida, the presidential entourage included Secretary of State John Hay (formerly Abraham Lincoln’s private secretary), three other cabinet members, staff and more than 20 representatives of the press.\n\nAmid tumultuous cheers, the presidential party debarked from the train into horse-drawn carriages on loan from the mansions of some of Redlands’ most wealthy citizens, such as A.E. Sterling and Albert Burrage, for the short journey up Orange Street to the Casa Loma. A crowd estimated at 10,000, almost twice the population of Redlands at the time, was spread out between the depot and the hotel. Hundreds of “kodak fiends,” as the Facts reporter described them, took “snapshots” of the president.\n\nOne thousand eighty schoolchildren from Crafton, Lugonia, Kingsbury and Union High schools, dressed in their Sunday finest and waving flags, lined both sides of the route. At the hotel, a detachment of young Marines as well as a contingent of graying Civil War veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic lent a martial air to the occasion.\n\nThe Indian band from Perris School, 22 strong, provided music. A band from Redlands had been asked to perform, but when they had the temerity to demand a $20 appearance fee, the city’s welcoming committee decided to make other arrangements.\n\nAt a specially constructed speaking platform in front of the hotel, Redlands Mayor William Fowler introduced Gov. Gage, who in turn extended the official California welcome to the president and then introduced him to the crowd. McKinley gave a well-received 20-minute speech recounting California’s admission to the Union and many subsequent contributions to American progress.\n\nThe presidential party, minus Mrs. McKinley, who was in poor health throughout the western trip, then reboarded their carriages for a 100-minute tour of Redlands. An impressive team of four milk-white horses, provided by Albert Burrage, pulled the carriage containing the president and Gov. Gage. Traveling back down Orange Street and under the special arch, the caravan continued through Smiley Park in front of A.K. Smiley Public Library. From there it was out Brookside Avenue to what is now Terracina Boulevard where the president asked to make a slight detour to see the home of Gen. Henry Lawton, a prominent Redlander who had been killed in the Philippine Insurrection a year before.\n\nNext it was up into the Smiley brothers’ botanical wonder known as Ca on Crest Park where the president’s carriage stopped briefly at the homes of both Albert and Alfred Smiley. Viewing the city from the top of Prospect Park, McKinley was heard to exclaim, “This is a sight for the gods.”\n\nThe caravan then traveled down Cajon Street, made a quick jaunt through Smiley Park past the library for a second time and then returned to the Southern Pacific depot. As the train prepared to depart, the president was compelled to give another brief address to the crowd.\n\n“I appear now only for a moment that I may express, not only my thanks for the warm welcome you have given us, but the great pleasure I have had in the drive about your city, through its parks and avenues, and in my observation of your beautiful homes. It is hardly conceivable that all of this has been done in the period of 12 years. It is the most prosperous looking, and certainly the handsomest city of 12 years of age that I have seen anywhere in my travels.”\n\nPunctually at noon, the presidential train departed as Redlanders congratulated themselves that the day had been a spectacular success and by far the most momentous in the history of the young community. In the enthusiastic press coverage of the visit, there was only one small note of disappointment.\n\n“Miss Humphries and Miss McIntosh had everything in readiness at the library for a call from the President’s party and were very much disappointed in its failure to do so.”\n\nDon McCue is archivist at the A.K. Smiley Public Library Heritage Room and curator of the Lincoln Memorial Shrine."
