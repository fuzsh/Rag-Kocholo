        "text": "Before Saturday’s attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, there have been multiple instances of political violence targeting U.S. presidents, former presidents and major party presidential candidates.\n\nA look at some of the assassinations and attempted assassinations that have occurred since the nation’s founding in 1776:\n\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, the 16th president\n\nLincoln was the first president to be assassinated, shot by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, as he and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, attended a special performance of the comedy “Our American Cousin” at Ford’s Theatre in Washington.\n\nLincoln was taken to a house across the street from the theater for medical treatment after he was shot in the back of the head. He died the next morning. His support for Black rights has been cited as a motive behind his killing.\n\nTwo years before the assassination, during the Civil War, which was fought over slavery, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation granting freedom to slaves within the Confederacy.\n\nLincoln was succeeded by Vice President Andrew Johnson.\n\nBooth was shot and killed on April 26, 1865, after he was found hiding in a barn near Bowling Green, Virginia.\n\nJAMES GARFIELD, the 20th president\n\nGarfield was the second president to be assassinated, six months after taking office. He was walking through a train station in Washington on July 2, 1881, to catch a train to New England when he was shot by Charles Guiteau.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, the telephone inventor, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet lodged in Garfield’s chest using a device he designed specifically for the president. The mortally wounded president lay at the White House for several weeks but died in September after he was taken to the New Jersey shore.\n\nGarfield was succeeded by Vice President Chester Arthur.\n\nGuiteau was found guilty and executed in June 1882.\n\nWILLIAM McKINLEY, the 25th president\n\nMcKinley was shot after giving a speech in Buffalo, New York, on Sept. 6, 1901. He was shaking hands with people passing through a receiving line when a man fired two shots into his chest at point-blank range. Doctors had expected McKinley to recover but gangrene then set in around the bullet wounds.\n\nMcKinley died on Sept. 14, 1901, six months after opening his second term.\n\nHe was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nLeon F. Czolgosz, an unemployed, 28-year-old Detroit resident, admitted to the shooting. Czolgosz was found guilty at trial and put to death in the electric chair on Oct. 29, 1901.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY, the 35th president\n\nKennedy was fatally shot by a hidden assassin armed with a high-powered rifle as he visited Dallas in November 1963 with first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Shots rang out as the president’s motorcade rolled through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas.\n\nKennedy was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he died soon after.\n\nHe was succeeded by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was sworn into office in a conference room aboard Air Force One. He is the only president to take the oath of office on an airplane.\n\nHours after the assassination, police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald after finding a sniper’s perch in a nearby building, the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nTwo days later, Oswald was being taken from police headquarters to the county jail when Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby rushed forward and fatally shot Oswald.\n\nGERALD FORD, the 38th president\n\nFord faced two assassination attempts within weeks in 1975 and was not hurt in either incident.\n\nIn the first attempt, Ford was on his way to a meeting with California’s governor in Sacramento when Charles Manson disciple Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme pushed through a crowd on the street, drew a semi-automatic pistol and pointed it at Ford. The gun wasn’t fired.\n\nFromme was sentenced to prison and released in 2009.\n\nIt was 17 days later when another woman, Sara Jane Moore, confronted Ford outside a hotel in San Francisco. Moore fired one shot and missed. A bystander grabbed her arm as a second shot was attempted.\n\nMoore was sent to prison and released in 2007.\n\nRONALD REAGAN, the 40th president\n\nReagan was leaving a speech in Washington, D.C., and walking to his motorcade when he was shot by John Hinckley Jr., who was in the crowd.\n\nReagan recovered from the March 1981 shooting. Three other people were shot, including his press secretary, James Brady, who was partially paralyzed as a result.\n\nHinckley was arrested and confined to a mental hospital after a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in shooting Reagan. In 2022, Hinckley was freed from court oversight after a judge determined he was “no longer a danger to himself or others.”\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH, the 43rd president\n\nBush was attending a rally in Tbilisi in 2005 with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili when a hand grenade was thrown toward him.\n\nBoth men were behind a bulletproof barrier when the grenade, wrapped in cloth, landed about 100 feet away. The grenade did not explode, and no one was hurt.\n\nVladimir Arutyunian was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY, presidential candidate\n\nKennedy was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was killed at a Los Angeles hotel — moments after giving his victory speech for winning the 1968 California primary.\n\nKennedy was a U.S. senator from New York and the brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated five years earlier.\n\nFive other people were wounded in the shooting.\n\nSirhan Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. That was commuted to life in prison, where Sirhan remains after his latest petition for release was denied last year.\n\nGEORGE C. WALLACE, presidential candidate\n\nWallace was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was shot during a campaign stop in Maryland in 1972, an incident that left him paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWallace, the governor of Alabama, was known for his segregationist views, which he later renounced.\n\nArthur Bremer was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to prison. He was released in 2007."
