        "text": "Produced by the renowned Casa Rojo winery, Alexander VS The Ham Factory is a red wine of great character and elegance. Made from 100% Tinto Fino grapes from vineyards over 60 years old in the municipalities of La Horra and Hontoria de Valdearados. We are located at an average altitude of between 850 and 900 metres in the province of Burgos. An extreme continental climate, with large temperature ranges and a clay-limestone soil, here the Tinto Fino gives grapes of great concentration and aromatic richness. Vinification takes place in accordance with tradition, with fermentation in stainless steel at a controlled temperature and subsequent ageing in French oak barrels for 20 months. In addition, 10% of the mass undergoes malolactic fermentation in barrels, giving the wine greater smoothness and harmony. In the Alexander VS The Ham Factory glass, it has an intense garnet red colour. The nose reveals a complex and fascinating bouquet, with notes of ripe black fruits, such as blackberry and blueberry, interwoven with hints of spices, leather and sweet tobacco from the ageing in wood. In the mouth it conquers with its elegance and beautiful structure. Intense aromas of ripe fruit are accompanied by balsamic and spicy notes. The tannins, although present, are well integrated and give the wine a persistent and refined finish. A wine with excellent ageing potential, it tends to develop complex and refined tertiary notes over time."
