        "text": "Linguistic pluralism in Spain\n\nThe official language in Spain is Spanish or Castilian Spanish, which is spoken by all citizens. However, certain Autonomous Communities have their own official language in addition to Spanish. Catalan is spoken in Catalonia, Galician in Galicia, and Basque in the Basque Country and part of Navarre. The Balearic Islands and Valencia also have their own official languages. In order to better integrate into any of these regions, you should study the local language.\n\nCommunicating in other languages\n\nEnglish is by far the most used language to communicate with non Spanish speaking foreigners. France and German are the next most used, but a considerable distance behind.\n\nLearning Spanish\n\nIf you want to study Spanish before coming to Spain, the Cervantes Institute network is a good option. To find the nearest centre you can visit the web page. Once in Spain, there are also Official Language Schools in each province."
