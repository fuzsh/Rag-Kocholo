        "text": "\"Regions of Spain\" redirects here. For other uses, see Regions of Spain (disambiguation).\n\nIn Spain, an autonomous community (Spanish: comunidad aut√≥noma) is the first sub-national level of political and administrative division, created in accordance with the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with the aim of guaranteeing limited autonomy of the nationalities and regions that make up Spain.[1][2]\n\nThere are 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla) that are collectively known as \"autonomies\" or regions.[lower-roman 1] The two autonomous cities have the right to become autonomous communities.\n\nThe autonomous communities exercise their right to self-government within the limits set forth in the constitution and organic laws known as Statutes of Autonomy,[lower-roman 2] which broadly define the powers that they assume.\n\nEach statute sets out the devolved powers (Spanish: competencia) for each community; typically those communities with stronger local nationalism have more powers, and this type of devolution has been called asymmetrical which is on the whole seen as advantageous, able to respond to diversity.[3]"
