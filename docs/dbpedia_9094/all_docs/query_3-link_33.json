        "text": "General information\n\nLegaris Edición Especial 2020 was grown on Tempranillo vines located in Valbuena de Duero (Valladolid), Peñaranda de Duero and Olmedillo de Roa (Burgos), part of them old and gobelet-trained. The 2020 vintage received the highest rating in the D.O. Ribera del Duero – Excellent – and the winery selected the best bunches from its various plots to make this wine.\n\nThe grapes were destemmed and transferred to vats practically whole. Following pre-fermentative cold maceration for 48 hours they underwent alcoholic fermentation at 25ºC to preserve the varietal aromas. Maceration lasted a total of 10−12 days. The wine then underwent spontaneous malolactic fermentation in stainless steel vats before being transferred to American oak barrels, where it remained for 6 months to enhance its structure and complexity.\n\nBodegas Legaris, founded in 1999, is the most personal winery belonging to Raventós Codorníu, a firm listed among the 50 most admired brands in the world in 2022 according to the prestigious Drinks International publication. At Legaris, Raventós Codorníu focus on producing smaller quantities of wines grown on their magnificent 120-hectare vineyard, carefully chosen when they came to Ribera del Duero to create the fresh, fruity and elegant wines they wanted. Many of the vines are located at high altitudes, where the grapes ripen more slowly with fresher and more concentrated flavours. Their facilities, situated in Curiel de Duero, are among the most modern in the area.\n\nLegaris Edición Especial 2020 (D.O. Ribera del Duero) goes well with a nice piece of secreto (Ibérico pork fillet) with roasted potato slices, as well as semimature cheeses.\n\nOpinión de sus Creadores\n\n\"Very intense garnet-red colour with bluish hues. Predominant aromas of ripe red fruit in the nose that are characteristic of this grape variety blend harmoniously with the fine toasty and spicy notes from barrel ageing. Full, tasty and round on the palate. \""
