        "text": "General information\n\nTo make Tionio Edición Especial 2022 the winery selected several plots of its own Tinto Fino (Tempranillo) vines located in the municipalities of Curiel de Duero and Peñafiel (Valladolid), at an altitude of 750 m. The Curiel vines are close to the river Duero, while La Asperilla in Peñafiel, the firm’s best vineyard, is an estate with clay soils facing the castle. All the vineyards are organically farmed.\n\nThe grapes were stemmed and transferred to vats almost whole. After cold pre-fermentative maceration for 48 hours, they underwent alcoholic fermentation at 25–26º C to preserve the varietal aromas. Maceration was for a total of 8–10 days, followed by spontaneous malolactic fermentation in stainless steel vats. The wine was then transferred to French and American oak barrels, where it remained for 9 months to gain structure and complexity.\n\nBodegas Tionio is the D.O. Ribera del Duero winery belonging to the Raventós Codorníu group, a family firm that dates back to 1551 and owns various wineries located in the most nationally and internationally prestigious winemaking areas. Tionio is based in Pago de Casar, in Pesquera de Duero, and the grapes that go into making its wines chiefly come from an iconic vineyard: La Asperilla, an estate in the neighbouring area of Peñafiel, spanning 20 hectares.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was established in Hispania, ‘tionio’ was the name given to the purest and most delicate wine. On this basis, Bodegas Tionio aims to achieve the best expression and essence of the Tinto Fino or Tempranillo variety grown on its vineyards in the D.O. Ribera del Duero.\n\nTionio Edición Especial 2022 (D.O. Ribera del Duero) is perfect with meat dishes such as lamb stew or roast suckling pig.\n\nCATA's notes\n\nDeeply pigmented, purplish-red wine with purplish hues. Predominant aromas of fresh red fruit in the nose, characteristic of the vintage, well integrated with the toasty and spicy notes from barrel ageing. Fresh, elegant palate with good bottle-ageing potential.\n\nOpinión de sus Creadores\n\n\"\n\n2022 is a vintage marked by scant rainfall and the very high temperatures recorded throughout much of the vines’ vegetative cycle. It was therefore a highly heterogeneous year from the point of view of the ripening of the grapes. Due to low rainfall the berries scarcely attained the usual average weight parameters, resulting in a higher skin to pulp ratio. This directly influenced the intensity of the wines’ pigmentation, one of the most salient features of this year’s wines. These very extreme temperature and humidity conditions nevertheless ensured the excellent health of our vines throughout the whole cycle, enabling us to stagger grape picking, harvesting each plot depending on its ripeness and the type of wine to be made. The good climate conditions in late September and early October were conducive to the satisfactory phenolic ripeness of the grapes. Harvesting began very early at our winery, on 19 September (11 days before the 2021 vintage) with the Tinto Fino and ended on 13 October (the date harvesting would normally begin) with the Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\n\""
