        "text": "'\n\nLegaris Reserva red wine.\n\nLegaris Reserva is the benchmark wine of the Legaris winery and the most awarded of all its Ribera del Duero wines. The character of Legaris Reserva is clearly marked by both the vineyard and the masterful blend of different wines made from the Tempranillo variety and aged in different types of barrels.\n\nIt is a wine produced in Curiel de Duero (Valladolid) belonging to the D.O. Ribera del Duero produced by Legaris winemaker Jorge Bombín.\n\nThe Tempranillo grapes used to make Legaris Reserva red wine are harvested by hand in 15-kilo boxes; on arrival at the winery they are stored in a cold room for one night at 6º C and the following morning they are thoroughly inspected on the selection table. Once destemmed and transported by belts, it arrives practically whole to the small truncated cone-shaped stainless steel tanks of 5,200 liters, where we elaborate separately the different origins of the grapes. We begin with a pre-fermentation maceration of several days at low temperature before alcoholic fermentation, which is carried out with indigenous yeasts at 28-30 ºC, to express the characteristics of the different terroirs, respecting the uniqueness of each vintage. During fermentation, frequent manual punch-downs are carried out and the wine is devatted 3 weeks after vatting, obtaining only the \"flor\" wine and without subsequent addition of the press wine.\n\nThe Legaris Reserva wine then underwent malolactic fermentation in new French oak barrels. Subsequently the wine remains for 20 months in Bordeaux barrels of fine grain French oak, half new and half of a wine, from 10 different cooperages. After a gentle clarification with egg white, it was bottled in May. The Legaris Reserva red wine was further refined during its 24-month bottle ageing before being released.\n\nOnly 86,037 Bordeaux bottles of Legaris Reserva Ribera del Duero were produced.\n\n'\n\nSight: 'Vino de intenso color rojo oscuro con tonalidades moradas. Lágrima lenta y fina.'\n\nMouth: 'Buena estructura, siendo amplio en boca. Paso cálido y aterciopelado. Siguen los sabores que hemos encontrado en nariz. Taninos pulidos. Vino muy amplio, potente, cálido y con un largo postgusto'"
