        "text": "It can be difficult for the newly arrived in Spain to get to grips with the number of different laws and what can seem to be a never-ending battle with bureaucracy here. The arrangements for many aspects of life are perhaps complicated by the fact that it’s not only Spain that makes decisions about what you should and shouldn’t do, the part of it where you live does as well. Perhaps a little like by-laws in England but with more power to the elbow.\n\nSpain has a high degree of regional autonomy. To begin with, there are 17 autonomous communities in Spain and 2 autonomous cities. The autonomous communities are led by regional governments who are responsible for education, health, social services, culture, urban and rural development and in some cases, policing. Andalucia has the largest population but Castilla y León has the largest area of land. Asturias is famous for its seafood whilst Catalonia is home to Barcelona, Spain’s second largest city.\n\nSo what does this mean for you? Spain is, in fact, a very de-centralised country. This can be confusing and means that you cannot generalise across regions. What might be acceptable in one region might not be in another. It can feel as though you are living within a multitude of layers that includes municipalities, provinces and regions and finding your place within the structure is not always easy.\n\nHowever, it also means that there is a high degree of local control. Laws are made and influenced locally and highlight the very unique character that many of these regions have. Finding out more about the different communities can help you get to grips with Spain’s unusual patchwork whilst also embracing the country as a whole.\n\nA tale of communities and provinces\n\nThe autonomous communities are usually made up of two or more provinces which are then further divided into municipalities. For example:\n\nAutonomous community = Valencia\n\nProvince = Alicante\n\nMunicipality = Torrevieja\n\nLanguage = Valenciano as well as Castellano\n\nEach community has its own flag and coat of arms."
