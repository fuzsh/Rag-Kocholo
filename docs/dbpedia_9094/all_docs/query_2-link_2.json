        "text": "Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own executive, legislative, and judicial powers. These are similar to, but not the same as, states in the United States of America, for example.\n\nSpain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called \"historic communities\": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.\n\nThe Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six, where Spanish is co-official with other languages, as follows:\n\nCatalonia: Catalan and Occitan\n\nValencian Community: Catalan (also called Valencian there)\n\nBalearic Islands: Catalan\n\nGalicia: Galician\n\nBasque Country: Basque\n\nNavarre: Basque (only in the north and near the border with the Basque County)\n\nList of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):\n\nAndalusia (its capital is Sevilla)\n\nAragon (its capital is Zaragoza)\n\nAsturias (its capital is Oviedo)\n\nBalearic Islands (its capital is Palma de Mallorca)\n\nBasque Country (its capital is Vitoria)\n\nCanary Islands (they have two capitals - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife)\n\nCantabria (its capital is Santander)\n\nCastile-La Mancha (its capital is Toledo)\n\nCastile and León (its capital is Valladolid)\n\nCatalonia (its capital is Barcelona)\n\nExtremadura (its capital is Mérida)\n\nGalicia (its capital is Santiago de Compostela)\n\nLa Rioja (its capital is Logroño)\n\nCommunity of Madrid (its capital is Madrid)\n\nRegion of Murcia (its capital is Murcia)\n\nNavarre (its capital is Pamplona)\n\nValencian Community (its capital is Valencia)"
