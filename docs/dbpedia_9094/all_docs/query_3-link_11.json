        "text": "The Legaris winery is is located in Curiel de Duero (Valladolid) in Ribera del Duero and is part of the Codorníu Raventós group. Legaris own 93 hectares of vine and also long-term arrangements with other wineries. As well as its traditional range of Roble, Crianza, and Reserva wines, in recent years the winery has explored the geographical wealth of the area working with both ‘village wines’ and their Páramos wine to demonstrate the qualities of high-altitude vineyards (páramo means moorland in Spanish), and the splendid complexity of the soils and landscapes of the Ribera appellation. Always striving for wines which express their origins through their structure, concentration and elegance, the winemaking philosophy of the Legaris winery is based on selecting the best grapes, minimum intervention, utmost respect for the fruit and an extremely meticulous production process.\n\nLegaris belongs to the Codorníu group, which has many projects in other denominations in Spain and worldwide, totalling more than 3,000 hectares of vineyards in its possession: Masia Bach (Catalunya), Scala Dei (Priorat), Abadia de Poblet (Conca de Barberà), Bodegas Bilbaínas (Rioja), Raimat (Costers del Segre), Séptima (Mendoza, Argentina), Artesa (Napa Valley) and Nuviana (Valle del Cinca). Present in all 5 continents and with a team consisting of over 800 personnel, in just the last few years, the Codorníu Group’s catalogue has received in excess of 150 international awards for its wines and Cavas."
