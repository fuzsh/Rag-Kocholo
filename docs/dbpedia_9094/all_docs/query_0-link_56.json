        "text": "Rationale\n\nHip fracture (HF) is one of the main health problems associated with ageing and frailty. It has serious repercussions regarding morbidity and mortality, with a considerable number of patients developing functional dependence and an increase in institutionalization.1–3 According to statistical data from the Spanish Ministry of Health, the incidence in 2008 in Spain was 103.76 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The rate increases for those over 75 years of age, up to to 2,534 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for the age group 90-94 years of age.3 An incidence of approximately 40,000 to 45,000 hip fractures has recently been calculated per year in Spain, the care of which involves an annual cost of 1,591 million Euros and a loss of 7,218 quality-adjusted life-years.4,5 The incidence is expected to continue to increase in the near future, especially among people over the age of 80 years.5\n\nSome factors in the care process of HF are known to influence its evolution and patients’ clinical results. Thus, issues such as delay in surgical intervention, lack of prevention and treatment of medical problems or the lack of early rehabilitation, lead to a deterioration in the clinical course of patients and an increase in the final costs of the process.6\n\nAdvances in terms of surgical technique, types of anaesthesia, perioperative care, early rehabilitation and working in multidisciplinary teams have improved the clinical results.6,7 Nevertheless, the rates of mortality and of functional decline secondary to this type of fracture continue to be very high.\n\nIn recent years, several articles and Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) have been published with recommendations that have enabled better care of and agreement around this condition.8–12 As has occurred previously in Great Britain with the publication of the Blue Book shared by several scientific societies of professionals who care for patients with hip fracture,13 the Clinical Practice Guidelines in Geriatrics for the Elderly Affected by Hip Fracture was published in Spain in 2007 in collaboration with the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology and the Spanish Society of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology (SEGG and SECOT; Spanish acronyms), as well as another CPG released in 2012 endorsed by the Spanish Association of Osteoporotic Fractures (SEFRAOS; Spanish acronym)14,15. But there has been no follow-up regarding their implementation in Spanish hospitals, and the data available regarding clinical variability in the care of this process show large variability; for example, surgical delay, length of hospital stay, number of rehabilitation sessions, availability of referral to a functional recovery unit, number of physician follow-up visits or osteoporosis treatment rates, among other aspects4,16,17.\n\nIn several countries, national registries have been set up for patients with HF. Among these, the most relevant are those undertaken in England, Scotland and Australia. These experiences and others have been summarised in recent publications, observing that in the countries in which a HF registry has been undertaken, the care process has been audited as a result, inspecting whether it adheres to or deviates from the quality standards established and introducing corrective measures to improve the care process and efficiency18,19. For example, after the implementation of the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) in England, from 2007 to 2011 the percentage of patients who received surgery in the first 48hours after admission increased from 54.5% to 71.3%, mortality after 30 days decreased from 10.9% to 8.5% and early orthogeriatric intervention in patients admitted due to HF increased from 48% to 90.2%.20 Regarding efficiency, there was also a reduction in hospital stay (which is the process phase with the greatest consumption of resources) and in institutionalization after discharge following implementation of the British NHFD registry. A recent external evaluation has even shown an improvement in survival after 30, 90 and 365 days.20\n\nTherefore, the information provided by these registries is important for doctors and for managers. Establishing and studying these registries provides an opportunity to work together auditing the process, detecting any possible weaknesses in our services, identifying areas for improvement, and monitoring the impact of changes in clinical results and in management.\n\nIn Spain, there have previously been registries and multicentre studies of great interest.\n\nIn the community of Castilla y León, supported by the respective regional scientific societies of Geriatrics and Gerontology and of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, orthogeriatric collaboration was assessed in the care of patients with HF admitted to 14 public hospitals in 2013;17 and subsequently, in 2014 and 2015, a temporary registry of hip fractures was developed for 2 months each year in the same hospitals. Currently, this registry has 776 cases; the main findings have recently been published.21\n\nIn recent years, a multicentre study called SPARE-HIP was completed, endorsed by the Spanish Society of Osteoporotic Fractures (SEFRAOS; Spanish acronym), which involved studying a cohort of 30 cases of hip fracture each in 45 Spanish hospitals.22 Its goal was to obtain a partial sample representative of the national territory.\n\nLastly, Caeiro et al. recently published another multicentre study that included 487 patients with HF admitted consecutively in 28 hospitals in 6 autonomous communities in Spain, in order to find out the social and economic burden associated to fracture during hospitalization and 12 months afterwards.16\n\nThese registries are clearly of great interest because, although each provides only a partial picture, they compile considerable numbers of patients cared for at multiple sites in the Spanish territory and provide valuable information.\n\nRegarding the above, the National Hip Fracture Registry (NHFR; RNFC, Spanish acronym), which is currently under way, proposes improving some aspects, namely, 1) consecutively including all patients diagnosed with HF at each participating hospital in a continuous registry and 2) obtaining a comprehensive sample that can epidemiologically ensure representativeness on a national level, with a final vocation for including all patients with HF who are hospitalized in the country.\n\nMethod\n\nThe registry will consist of a multicentre, observational, descriptive study of the epidemiological, clinical and care characteristics obtained during admission, inpatient evolution and one month after experiencing a HF due to fragility in a representative sample of, initially, 48 Spanish hospitals in the National Health Service network (Annex 1).\n\nThe inclusion criteria are: having been admitted to one of the participating hospitals with the diagnosis of hip fracture due to fragility (due to a fall from standing height), being older than 74 years of age (75 years or older) and understanding and signing an informed consent (by the patient or their next of kin).\n\nThe exclusion criterion is any HF occurring as a result of high energy trauma as well as pathologic fractures due to cancer.\n\nThe variables to be collected include (Table 1): age, gender, hospital, autonomous community, dates of admissions, surgery and hospital discharge, place of residence prior to admission, at discharge and at one month, prefracture patient mobility and mobility one month postfracture, cognitive status at the time of admission (Pfeiffer Questionnaire), calcium and vitamin D supplements, and anti-osteoporosis medication (antiresorptive and osteoforming drugs) prescribed to the patient prior to the fracture, at hospital discharge and after one month, the type of fracture, the type of surgical intervention performed, the anaesthetic risk (ASA Classification), the type of anaesthesia used during surgery, the appearance of pressure ulcers during hospitalization, their vital status at the time of hospital discharge and after one month, the involvement of a clinical physician in addition to a specialist in Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, early postoperative mobilization (in the first 24hours after the intervention), the length of hospital stay, surgical delay, as well as the the existence of surgical readmissions and surgical re-interventions in the month following the fracture.\n\nTable 1.\n\nList of variables of the National Hip Fracture Registry (NHFR) (adaptation with a reverse translation reviewed, from the dataset of the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN)).\n\nA.

POST-HOSPITALIZATION PHASE\n\nThe following variables are recorded 30 days after admission to Traumatology du to hip fracture. It can be done bu a follow-up visit or a telephone interview. An interval 3 days before or after the 30 days is accepted for data retrieval5.01 Readmission related to the hip fracture: readmission due to orthopaedic surgery 5.02 Repeat surgery in the 30 days following admission 5.03 Alive at 30 days 5.04 30 day mobility – use the same classification as point 2.02 5.05 Plave of residence at 30 days: Home, Nursing Home, Acute Hospitalization, Rehabilitation Unit, Long Term Care Facility, Deceased, Unknown. 5.06 Bone protection drugs: if the patient is taking bone protecting medication 30 days following the fracture\n\nData collection will be conducted using the Spanish version of the Fragility Fracture Network registry (FFN Minimum Common Dataset - MCD). The FFN (Fragility Fracture Network) is an international organization that aims to achieve maximum functional recovery and quality of life for people who have suffered an osteoporotic fracture, as well as secondary prevention through the global optimization of the multidisciplinary management of this health problem. Its activities include the creation of a network encompassing the greatest number of countries possible and the creation of Consensus Guidelines, thus establishing quality standards and systematically measuring their application. Within the FFN, in 2013 members of an international working group composed mainly by representatives of other previously existing national registries, proposed a Minimum Common Dataset (FFN-MCD) with three important characteristics: it was concise, it covered the key elements of the casemix, care and results, and it was compatible with already existing databases.23\n\nData collection will take place in two phases. In the hospital phase, the data corresponding to baseline status and those referring to the process until the time of discharge will be collected by the physician in charge of the patient. In the post-discharge phase, data will be collected one month after the fracture by telephone interview or at a follow-up visit by the corresponding professional.\n\nThere will be a representative at each participating hospital as the local person in charge of the registry, responsible for sending data and safeguarding it. The people in charge of each site will provide data on a quarterly basis for all the patients treated for a hip fracture at their hospital, including follow-up one month after discharge. The deadline for data inclusion will end 4 weeks after the end of each quarter. The data sent will be encrypted, and entered into an online platform for their analysis.\n\nA data manager will be in charge of assembling the data from all the hospitals, assigning an identifier to each site that includes the autonomous community of origin, data clean-up, performing descriptive analyses and the pertinent associations, drafting global quarterly reports (of all the cases provided by the group of hospitals) and global annual and partial reports (by autonomous communities, ACs).\n\nReports will be sent to the people in charge at each hospital, to the representatives of the registry for each AC, to the scientific societies that endorse it and to the sponsors.\n\nLimitations and strengths of the NHFR\n\nThe limitations of the Registry may be conditioned by the inherent nature of the study, namely, data collection by the healthcare professional who cares for the patient, which could introduce biases on the one hand, but on the other also provide added clinical value regarding other databases, such as administrative ones.18 For pragmatic and economic reasons, this is the manner in which data collection is being carried out in the international registries currently under way as, otherwise, costs for the project would be greatly increased. It is unclear whether this fact may interfere negatively (because of the aforementioned bias) or positively (by generating a quest for improvement in regular clinical activity). To minimize this possible bias, direct procurement of information electronically will be promoted whenever possible through hospital activity records and subsequently some variables available will be checked in the CMDB.\n\nAnother limitation is financial dependence to guarantee continued viability of the Project; although no financial compensation is foreseen neither for the professionals who provide their cases, nor for the people in charge at each hospital or for the investigating team, it will be necessary to hire some professionals such as a data manager and technical secretary.\n\nThe general strengths include the continuity of the registry, as it will include all the patients hospitalized due to HF at each participating hospital, and their demographic representativeness, ensured by the large number of hospitals participating from the start and the desire to increase the number of hospitals.\n\nThe strengths inherent to the study include the prior experience of the investigative team in the area approached by the Registry, specifically their professional achievement in multidisciplinary coordinated treatment units (Co-managed care) for the care of patients with hip fracture, the prior experience in the study and casemix analysis of hospital cohorts of patients with hip fracture, the prior experience in coordination, start-up and results analysis of the aforementioned Multicentre Hip Fracture Registries, albeit more limited at a national level, the previous experience of the team of epidemiologists in the initiation of longitudinal demographic epidemiological studies in the elderly population, the recognition by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) of six of the Orthogeriatric units where research team members work as sites with Best Practices in Fractures Liaison Services (FLS) in Hip Fracture, the scientific and educational contribution of the investigative team, specifically regarding the subject of hip fracture, which can be quantified in a total of 36 indexed articles on PubMed regarding aspects related to HF in the elderly, in addition to several Doctoral Theses and a multitude of communications at congresses. In addition to its own team of investigators, the project includes the support of external “advisers” for assessment and methodological support by professionals of renowned prestige who have had responsibilities and accumulated experience through other hip fracture registries, in addition to unite, to date, a total of 48 hospitals for the Project.\n\nThe extrinsic strengths of the project include the following:\n\n-\n\nThe NHFR has the initial support of the General Sub-Directorate of Health Promotion and Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality.\n\n-\n\nIt has been endorsed by chairpeople in charge of the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN) Hip Fracture International Registry.\n\n-\n\nIt is backed by 18 national and regional Scientific Societies from the field of Geriatrics, Traumatology and some multidisciplinary fields related to fractures and bone metabolism. (Annex 1).\n\n-\n\nIt has been classified by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) as Non-PAS (a Non-Post-Authorization Study), and therefore the administrative procedure that governs it only includes the approval or ratification of the respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of each site.\n\n-\n\nIt has been registered at the Spanish Agency for Data Protection."
