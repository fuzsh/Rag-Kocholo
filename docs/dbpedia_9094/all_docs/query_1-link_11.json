        "text": "Simple primary style. Quite delicious, with an open dark fruits nose and a lovely sweetness to the fruit on the palate. Finishes with earthy, spicy tannins and a bit of bitterness.\n\nVery distinctive nose is quite classy, but quite oaky, showing a spicy, roast coffee edge to the dark fruits. More chocolatey coffee oak on the palate dominates this rather firm wine.\n\nThis is fantastic. Wonderful concentrated dark fruits nose with complex red and black fruits, a liqueur-like richness and lots of spiciness. The palate is concentrated and dense with nice fruit sweetness combined with smooth, firm tannins and some earthiness. Lots of potential here. Almost a complete wine.\n\nQuite a sweet open nose with notes of sweet coconut and vanilla. The coconut oak imprint on the palate is a little off-putting. An old fashioned style.\n\nSweet open, perfumed nose with a strong vanilla and coconut overlay to the red and black fruits. The palate is much more promising with dense spicy complexity and lovely supple yet strong tannins giving structure. Theres some tarry minerality, too. The oak is still quite prominent but there is lots happening here: a wine with a bright future ahead of it. There will be another year in the bottle before this wine is released, hence the + in the score."
