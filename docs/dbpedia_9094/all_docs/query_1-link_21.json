        "text": "Curiel de Duero, just 2km outside of Peñafiel, is a tiny village but perhaps one of the prettiest in the region and has played an important role in the wars of conquista and reconquista around the turn of the first millenium, testament to which the castle (now a hotel)\n\nAt the very heart o the Ribera de Duero wine region Curiel is surrounded by some of Spain's most prestigious bodegas and makes the perfect base to discover the area.\n\nBut it's not all about the wine. Peñafiel itself occupyies a strategic position on the Duero river and has an impressive 15th century castle which and dominates the town from its vantage point up on the ridge\n\nThe castle now houses the official wine museum of the Ribera de Duero and offers fine views out over Peñafiel and the Duero valley.\n\nThe town has some fine medieval convents and churches and an unusual square 'El Viejo Coso', with unique wood-faced houses, where bullfights used to be held.\n\nLocal specialties are roast suckling lamb (lechazo) and Flor de Esgueva – a local cheese made from sheep's milk.\n\nWest of Peñafiel the road to Valladolid is know as the 'Golden Mile' with Protos, Vega Sicilia, Pago de Carrovejas, Hacienda Abascal, Arzuaga, and Abadia Retuerta which is now a 5 star hotel and top-level gastronomic restaurant. Whilst nearer to Curiel are the bodegas of Pesquera and Emilio Moro, in very high demand in recent years"
