        "text": "The independence declaration by Catalonia’s regional Parliament has escalated a longstanding confrontation with the central government of Spain.\n\nThe government in Madrid moved quickly to crush the Catalan secession movement as a violation of the Spanish Constitution and to strip the restive region — at least temporarily — of most of its autonomous powers.\n\nThe fast-moving events raised new worries about possible repercussions among the other regions of Spain that have varying degrees of autonomy. More broadly, the Catalan leaders’ declaration put into question the political contiguity of Spain, which has the fifth-biggest economy in the European Union.\n\nSpain has 17 autonomous communities, making it a decentralized country, but not a federal state. Most of the regions have long had their own traditions and histories, but some have more recent and political roots.\n\nSpain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, often refers to his country as “the oldest nation in Europe.” That view is based on the 15th-century political union that resulted from the wedding of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand II, the monarch of Aragón, whose kingdom included Catalonia.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
