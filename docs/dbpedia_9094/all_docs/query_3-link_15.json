        "text": "Vast plains and evocative castles and mills… This could well be the portrait of Castilla. There are in fact 2 Castillas in Spain. Castilla Leon, mainly North West to Madrid and Castilla La Mancha, South of Spain´s capital. Madrid and its regions is somehow an island in the middle of these 2 large Castillas. Castilla´s name is due to the Castillos (Castles) and it actually means land of Castles.\n\nThe name of Castilla la Mancha has an arab origin. La Mancha (stain in Spanish) has in this case an arab origin from “Al-mansha” plain land and with no rivers.\n\nThe case of Castilla Leon (Lion in Spanish) is probably derived from “Legio” from the roman legions that founded the city of Leon in Castilla.\n\nWhy go to Castilla? There are many reasons why any of the 2 Castillas is worth a trip. A very valid one is for sure found in its imposing and many times isolated castles.\n\nMany of the castles found in both Castillas have a roman (this would apply more to Castilla Leon) and arab origins. The Reconquista (reconquest) is that period of Spain in which Christians progressively re-conquered the territory of Spain. The period was long, almost 8 centuries! And throughout this long process castles were erected, reinforced, destroyed and rebuilt, normally at those areas that served as borders in each phase of the reconquering process.\n\nAfter this sort historical introduction we go ahead with our list of 10 favorite castles in both Castillas.\n\nThis is one of Spain´s most famous castles. Many say it was used by Disney to inspire the Disney castle…. The name of Alcazar means fortress in Arabic.(similar name to the also famous Alcazar in Toledo). The Alcazar´s unique silhouette and its really privileged location is admired by any visitor to the City of Segovia. We always spend a good amount of time during our tours to Segovia. at some of the spots which offer the best views over the Alcazar (and the aqueduct). It does not matter how many times you visit Segovia: the views are so impressive! We have had cases of some of our customers asking us to stay longer… and longer… and\n\nThe old castle was destroyed and what we see today is a reconstruction of the original.\n\nThis castle is very famous in Spain. It has the shape of a ship and it is actually one of Spain´s longest castles (and also one of the most narrow ones). The image of the castle is seen from a long distance. Peñafiel is home to some of the wineries we visit during our Ribera del Duero wine tours. We always get fantastic feedback about this castle. From the castle you get excellent views over the region and over the city of Peñafiel and its fantastic Plaza del Coso."
