They were ennobled in 1641 by João IV of Portugal and hold noble titles in Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands. The Curiel family has links to banking and commerce, the arts, literature and politics.[7][8]\n\nIn 1647, David Curiel financed the Spanish delegation to the Peace of Westphalia.[9] Many members of the family sponsored Hebrew scholarship and practiced Judaism, either openly or as crypto-Jews.\n\nHamburg\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorian Jonathan Israel wrote that in the seventeenth century, \"the new Hamburg synagogue, a place of worship for some eight hundred Sephardi Jews, was filled with emblems and reminders of the Curiel family. The eternal lamp, the Ner Tamid, was provided by Jacob Curiel, as was the oil for keeping the lamp burning. And also the bimah that stood at the centre of the synagogue, the shelves which lined it being reserved for the use of Jacob and his family.\"[10]\n\nAmsterdam\n\n[edit]\n\nIsrael wrote that Moses Curiel of Amsterdam was \"renowned for his wealth, the prestige he enjoyed among non-Jews (the Stadholder William III stayed at his house for three days during one of his later visits to Amsterdam), and his handsome donations to the Amsterdam Portuguese Synagogue, his name figured constantly in Dutch Jewish community life and synagogue politics for over half a century.\" He continues: \"his opulent residence on the Nieuwe Herengracht, then called the Joden Herengracht, in Amsterdam, testified to the seigneurial grandeur of his life-style and his pretensions to leadership among the Portuguese Jewish 'nation' as the community was known in Holland.\"[11]\n\nIsrael noted that Nathan Curiel possessed a 'medieval illuminated Hebrew Bible of expectational beauty' which his father, Moses Curiel, had purchased from a Spanish Jew from North Africa. According to Israel, this Bible is considered 'the oldest and most venerable item possessed by Dutch Jewry.'[12]\n\nNotable members\n\n[edit]\n\nIsrael ben Meir di Curiel (1501–1573), rabbi at Safed, Ottoman Palestine[13]\n\nJacob Curiel of Coimbra (1514-1576), Portuguese merchant and pirate[14]\n\nJerónimo de Curiel (c. 1530-1578), Spanish merchant and diplomat[15]\n\nAlonso de Curiel (d. 1603), Spanish merchant and diplomat, son of Diego de Curiel[16]\n\nFrancisco de Vitoria (1540-1592), Roman Catholic Bishop, brother of Abraham Curiel[17]\n\nAbraham Curiel (1545-1609), Portuguese physician[18]\n\nJuan Alfonso de Curiel (d. 1609) Professor of philosophy at the University of Salamanca, converted to Catholicism[19]\n\nDavid Curiel (1594-1666), Portuguese merchant and diplomat[20]\n\nJacob Curiel (1587-1664), Portuguese merchant and diplomat[21]\n\nMoses Curiel (1620-1697), Portuguese merchant and diplomat[22]\n\nAlexandre Nunes da Costa (1655-1712), alias Selomoh Curiel, merchant and diplomat[23]\n\nLuis Curiel (1655-1724), Spanish lawyer and diplomat, converted to Catholicism[24]\n\nNathan Curiel (1666-1737), diplomat and collector of antiques[25]\n\nJuan Curiel (1690-1775), Spanish intellectual and founding member of the Royal Spanish Academy, son of Luis[26]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAbravanel family\n\nAuerbach family\n\nFould family\n\nRothschild family\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nI.
