Spain is divided into 17 comunidades autónomas (autonomous communities), plus two autonomous cities. The autonomous communities of Spain are a reflection of the diversity, history and political development of the country. Most autonomous communities are composed of smaller areas, called provincias (provinces).

Understanding the culture and geographic location of these autonomous communities will help you grasp how Spain evolved its language and local customs. The monarchy, the Spanish Civil War and ancient traditions are just some of the influences that have shaped the establishment of Spain’s autonomous communities.

A brief overview of the history and governance of Spain

After a long period of dictatorship under General Francisco Franco, Spain became a constitutional monarchy in 1978.

The newly formed Spanish Constitution established both national and regional governance. Importantly, Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution declares the “right to autonomy of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed.”

Three regions — Catalonia, Basque Country and Galicia — were quickly recognized as “historic nationalities.” By 1983, 17 autonomous communities of Spain had been established.

Each of the autonomous communities of Spain has its own regional government. This government has jurisdiction over education, health, social services, public works, culture and language, along with other responsibilities.

Diversity of the autonomous communities of Spain

The autonomous communities of Spain are diverse and rich in culture. With so much to learn, it’s no wonder why Spain is the second-most visited country in the world. Spain’s autonomous regions are also a product of a political and historical process that reflects this regional diversity.
