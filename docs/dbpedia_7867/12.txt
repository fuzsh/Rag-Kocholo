Josh Homme co-founded Eagles of Death Metal alongside Jesse Hughes in 1998, but his involvement has waned in recent years due to obligations with his other band, Queens of the Stone Age. Earlier this week, however, Homme made a rare live appearance with Eagles of Death Metal, joining the band on stage during their show in Paris. Below, watch fan-shot footage of the band racing through “I Want You So Hard” featuring Homme on drums.

Last year, Homme confirmed work on a new Eagles of Death Metal album, the band’s first since 2008’s Heart On. Additionally, the band has several more shows lined up in the near future, including gigs at Riot Fest’s Toronto, Chicago, and Denver festivals, as well as X-Fest Calgary and SONiC Boom in Edmonton.
