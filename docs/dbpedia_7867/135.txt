Josh Homme has confirmed he has begun work on a new Eagles Of Death Metal album.

Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Homme has released three albums with Eagles of Death Metal, his side project with musical partner Jesse Hughes. The duo last released an album in 2008 with ‘Heart On’.

Speaking to The Music, Homme confirmed that he and Hughes were making progress with a fourth album and that they are taking their own time about it. “I’ve actually been in the studio with Eagles Of Death Metal. We’re just kinda working at a reasonable, sort of casual pace,” said Homme. “We’ve got wandering and ambling down to a science.”

Meanwhile, Homme recently revealed that his band will record the follow-up to 2013’s ‘…Like Clockwork’ later this year, commenting that the band have “more than enough songs” for a new LP. Asked if they’d be recording another album soon, Homme stated: “Absolutely. We have more than enough songs. We’re booked ’til September, but after that we plan to jump in the studio and get going.”

Homme is also set to make a guest appearance on American sketch comedy Portlandia when it returns for its fourth season this year. The show, which is written and performed by Sleater-Kinney and Wild Flag singer Carrie Brownstein and ex-Saturday Night Live regular Fred Armisen, takes a satirical look at the hipster scene in Portland, Oregon and the various characters that inhabit the area. Season four of Portlandia will premiere in the US on February 27.
