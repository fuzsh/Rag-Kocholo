        "text": "The members of an American rock band whose concert was among the Paris targets attacked in a wave of bombings and shootings appear to be safe, media reported on Saturday. Eagles Of Death Metal were playing at the French capital's Bataclan concert hall, where authorities said around 100 people were killed on Friday. The Washington Post interviewed Mary Lou Dorio, mother of one member of the band, who said her son and the other members of the group escaped the concert hall as the attack began. \"It was awful,\" she told The Post, adding that her son, drummer Julian Dorio, had been able to phone his wife from a local police station after the ordeal. The fate of several crew members for the band remains unknown, Dorio said. Eagles of Death Metal is a blues-influenced garage rock band with California roots that has collaborated with some of music's biggest stars. Despite the name, it is not a death metal band but rather has worked with music A-listers including the actor Jack Black and Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana fame. The band's name, while frequently misunderstood, was initially chosen ironically as the artists -- longtime friends -- imagined a cross between hard-charging death rockers and the quintessential Americana band the Eagles. Hailing from Palm Desert in southern California, Eagles Of Death Metal have two consistent members -- lifelong friends Jesse Hughes, 43, and Josh Homme, 42. The band's lyricism -- and shows -- are often known for lasciviousness, with the two men seeing themselves in the tradition of sex, drugs and rock and roll. Homme, who also fronts another rock band, Queens of the Stone Age, is heavily tattooed and has spoken in the past of his ownership of guns. Eagles Of Death Metal were touring Europe to support a new album, \"Zipper Down,\" their first in seven years."
