        "text": "Yesterday, Iggy Pop and Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age and Eagles of Death Metal) announced a new collaborative album Post Pop Depression. Iggy Pop has now detailed the project, which is billed as an Iggy Pop album, produced by Homme. He's shared the first single from the album, \"Gardenia,\" too. Listen to it and check out the tracklist below.\n\nPost Pop Depression is out March 18 via Loma Vista. In addition to Homme's involvement, Queens of the Stone Age's Dean Fertita (also of the Dead Weather) plays guitars and keyboards on the album. Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders also contributed to the record. Pop and Homme plan on taking the album on the road, where they'll be accompanied by Fertita and Helders, plus QotSA's Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar) and Chavez's Matt Sweeney (bass).\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Homme revealed that it was \"by a stroke of fate\" that he didn't perform with his other band Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan the night of the Paris attacks. He added that making Post Pop Depression helped him overcome the trauma of the event: \"The fact that I had this to work on, it saved me,\" he said.\n\nPost Pop Depression:\n\n01 Break Into Your Heart\n\n02 Gardenia\n\n03 American Valhalla\n\n04 In the Lobby\n\n05 Sunday\n\n06 Vulture\n\n07 German Days\n\n08 Chocolate Drops\n\n09 Paraguay\n\nWatch Marc Maron talk about meeting Iggy Pop in an episode of Pitchfork.tv's \"Frames:"
