        "text": "Firstly I have to say I love Eagles of Death Metal. I saw them for the first time in November 2015 with my 14 year old son. It was his first standing gig. It's fair to say they did not disappoint. 2 days later the terrorist attack at the Bataclan happened.\n\nWhat has ensued beginning with the Love you all the time covers campaign to some of the quite frankly ludicrous statements Jesse Hughes left me torn about my love for the band. Yes the music put a smile on my face but some of the press generated by the Devil himself left me doubting the Peace Love Death Metal ethos. I doubted I could see them live again.\n\nWhilst on holiday I got a notification for their gig at the Barrowlands and immediately bought 2 tickets.\n\nI felt no enthusiasm leading up to the gig. Even with my now 15 year old son constantly hitting me with \"I hope they play this, or play this again\"\n\nSo the night of the gig comes round. White Miles were supporting them again as they had in November. Their performance seem some what subdued. The drummer almost sober this time round. But still a cracking set and a band well worth checking out.\n\nPreviously the band had come onto Magic. Before launching into their opening number. This time however they came onto the Bay City Rollers, I despise the Bay City Rollers.\n\nThen they blasted into I only want you. There can be no doubting the quality of the showmanship the band as a whole deliver. Jesse is of course the leading light bit without the support of a fully commited band to back his every move it would be a lack lustre affair.\n\nAs ever the band threw a ton of guitar picks and towels into the audience trying to involve everybody in the event that evening had become. Crashing through old tracks and new tracks a like. Even throwing in a Bowie cover of Moonage Daydream. Whilst I never saw him play, the Eagles of Death Metal cover was a thing of beauty and Davy Joe's solo was proof that rock n roll is always worth the effort.\n\nAs is customary Jesse came on for a couple shortened versions of songs picked from the audience played solo.\n\nThe emotion shown by the band when the crowd were going was immense and it was another cracking night and I was genuinely relieved I'd turned up to see them roll on. Other bands would've fallen by the wayside the 9 months these guys have endured. They've been through hell but look like they've got their selves back together and hopefully there will be more great nights like this one ahead.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nFormed in the late 90s, Eagles of Death Metal can boast the inclusion of two rock legends: Josh Homme and Jesse Hughes. Although the Eagles did not achieve the same commercial or critical levels as Homme's far more well known band Queens of The Stone Age, they have an equally solid discography and a devoted following on the live circuit.\n\nWith a number of variations of rock including grass, southern, alternative and desert all evident this evening, the audience are simply blown away with the sheer versatility of the two frontmen onstage. Hughes switches between guitars with ease for tracks from a selection of the albums including 'Heart On' and 'Peace Love Death Metal' and offer a succinct overall pace in order to keep the energy levels as high as the amp volumes. Homme is very much in charge of those thumping drum beats tonight and gets a blistering solo during 'I Got a Feelin (Just Nineteen)' which evokes huge roars from the masses. The six musicians onstage wrap up a masterful live show with 'Speaking In Tongues' and they look visibly pleased as they look out to the adoring sea of hands raised high clapping them on.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nMy personal philosophy on music is if Josh Homme has a part in it, then it's going to be good music. Unfortunately, the Eagles of Death Metal never really caught on to mainstream success, as their three albums didn't catch on but it is still excellent music and rocks harder than ever when performed live.\n\nThe members of the band have basically moved on to bigger projects, but when these guys get together they still rock out harder than ever. They bring a sort of energy to live shows that seems to be somewhat lost these days, as a lot of bands just show up and play their greatest hits and sound like their album. The Eagles of Death Metal bring that vibrant exuberance that when you hear the first strum of a guitar, you know you showed up to the right place and are in for a great show.\n\nEveryone always has a good time at the show, and they play a good mix of songs from all of their albums, but the place goes absolutely nuts when they bust out \"Speaking in Tongues\" or \"Wanna Be in L.A.\" With Josh and Jesse excelling all over the guitars, vocals, and drums, it's always a treat to watch and a guaranteed good time.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI was on a train on the way to Prague back in November. I was visiting an old friend and we were touring eastern Europe. About the time we crossed into the Czech Republic, there was this eerie and ominous feeling in the air. This was exasperated by the sudden appearance of heavily armed guards boarded and patrolled the train as we rolled into the first Czech stop. Suddenly, the television in the dining car we were sitting in told the whole story.\n\nParis. As American traveling abroad and seeing the incredible scenes that unfolded, the chaos in the aftermath and the sadness for those who endured the madness, it was then I changed my whole outlook on life. I vowed to take advantage of every breathe I took. I vowed to see the Eagles of Death Metal so that those who would try to stop Rock'n'Roll would never win.\n\nProvidence. There is no way this show could have been anymore than a statement that we are here to love one another and have a good time doing it. From the first note to the last, these boys killed it.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
