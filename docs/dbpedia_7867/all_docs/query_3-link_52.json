        "text": "London then relayed how he and a handful of other survivors managed to escape the Bataclan, waiting for the attackers to reload on two occasions before finally making their exit out of the venue. As London approached the glass doors to push them open, the glass shattered from a bullet, allowing him and others to escape the gruesome scene.\n\nHughes then brought fellow Eagles of Death Metal founder Josh Homme, who does not tour with the band, into the interview to talk about the attack from his perspective. “It took a second to believe that that’s really occurring, because it wasn’t on the news yet,” Homme said of the text messages he was receiving. “I was at my studio and I just got a text that didn’t make sense to me.” The text: ‘Bro everyone got shot … everyone got shot … they took hostages … I have blood all over me.”\n\nHomme and Hughes also talked about Nick Alexander, the Eagles of Death Metal’s merchandise manager who was killed in the attack. “I think about Nick who protected a friend of his,” Homme said, while Hughes added, “And stayed quiet and never called for help until he bled out because he didn’t want anybody else to get hurt.”\n\n“Several people – because there was mass confusion and the hallways became a labyrinth – several people hid in our dressing room, and the killers were able to get in and kill everyone of them, except for a kid who was hiding under my leather jacket,” Hughes said. “People were playing dead. They were so scared. A great reason why so many were killed was because so many people wouldn’t leave their friends. And so many people put themselves in front of people.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nAn emotional, visibly shaken Homme said that he wrote down the names of the Bataclan victims and noted the perceived futility of words in extreme situations like the attack and its aftermath. “I want to get down on my knees and just say, ‘Whatever you need,'” he said, when asked what he would say to the victims’ parents. “Because there’s nothing I can really say because words fail to grasp the thing.”\n\nHughes said the band will eventually finish the tour and is looking forward to returning to Paris. “I cannot wait to get back to Paris. I want to play,” said the singer. “I want to be the first band to play in the Bataclan when it opens back up. Our friends went there to see rock and roll and died. I want to go back and live.”\n\n“It’s going to take a long time for anyone to know what to do,” Homme added. “There is no why for this?”\n\nThe band recognized fans’ efforts to make their cover of Duran Duran’s “Save a Prayer” Number One as both a charitable and defiant gesture. Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon has donated his side of the publishing and royalties to the victims, and Homme used that gesture as an “opportunity to take a cue from something generous like that.”\n\nRelated\n\nThe singer asked musicians of all genres to cover Zipper Down track “I Love You All the Time” and they’ll donate all proceeds to victims. He also implored iTunes, Spotify, Tidal and other digital and streaming services to donate all proceeds from every cover of the song.\n\n“The more united, the more solidarity, the more together it is, the more it’s like a beacon of compassion and love and a progression forward to be part of something greater,” Homme said, noting that the band would talk to anyone involved in the attack that needed support.\n\nIn the end, each member delivered heartfelt messages of support to fans.\n\n“I love you all very much and we will move past this and we will do it together,” Hughes said. “I don’t think any of us could’ve handled it without the bizarre, unique support, especially from our French [fans]. I feel that we are in it together now and I really am grateful for that.”\n\nAdded Homme: “Don’t move. We’ll come to you.”"
