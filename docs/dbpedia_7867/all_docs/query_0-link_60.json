        "text": "Eagles Of Death Metal’s last show in Paris was tragically cut short when terrorists stormed the Bataclan concert hall and opened fire, killing 89 people. Tonight, after kicking off their rescheduled European tour this weekend, the band returned to Paris to finish the concert at the Olympia Theater. Free tickets were offered to survivors of the Bataclan, and even though the area around the Olympia was locked down by police and a team of 30 psychologists were in the crowd in case the music triggered survivors’ trauma, as The Daily Mail reports, frontman Jesse Hughes promised that the show would “be a regular rock show.” “I hope I can walk out on that stage and be stronger than I am being right now. I don’t want to fall to pieces in front of everyone. That is my biggest fear. This is therapy for me,” Hughes told the AFP earlier today. “Bonsoir Paris, we’re ready for this!” he told the crowd tonight, right before launching right into their first song. Josh Homme, who doesn’t normally tour with Eagles Of Death Metal and whose third child was just born this weekend, joined them, performing live with the band for the first time in months.
