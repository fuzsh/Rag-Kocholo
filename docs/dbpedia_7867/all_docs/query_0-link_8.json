The Eagles of Death Metal music is really quite eclectic. At times it’s rockabilly, alternative rock, punk and pop.\n\n“I Love You All the Time,” from the band’s fourth and latest album “Zipper Down,” is quite catchy and is ready-for-radio pop. The group performed the tune in Paris at the AccorHotels Arena during U2’s Dec. 7 concert that was shown live on HBO.\n\nLead singer Jesse Hughes’ vocals on “Wanna Be in LA” from 2008’s “Heart On” seem to invoke Devo, and “I Like to Move In the Night” from 2006’s “Death By Sexy” sounds influenced by the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe EODM were formed in 1998 by best friends Hughes and Josh Homme and are based in Palm Desert, Calif. They met in 1987. Homme also is the front man for Queens of the Stone Age. He was not on tour with EODM in Paris.\n\nAn explanation of the genesis of the band name is on the official EODM website: “The story goes that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as “The Eagles of Death Metal.” After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. With that, the band was born.\n\nEven more enigmatic than the band name is Hughes. He was raised Catholic, is an ordained minister, vocal proponent of right-wing ideals, gun rights, presidential candidate Donald Trump and put out a podcast titled “Our President is a foreign-born Muslim” as Boots Electric Radio on Nov. 10 on Spreaker.com. On the other hand, he is an unabashed drug user (speed and pot according to an Oct. 8 article on Grantland.com), prone to foul language during interviews, is divorced and his girlfriend is ex-porn star Tuesday Cross. He has posed naked with Cross (born Marina Cardenas in 1987), too.\n\nFast facts\n\nMembers of the band playing in Paris were Hughes, bassist Matt McJunkins, guitarist Eden Galindo, drummer Julian Dorio and guitarist Dave Catching.\n\nHughes, 43, has a teenage son from his marriage that ended in 1998.\n\nHomme, 42, is maried to fellow rocker Brody Dalle (born Bree Joanna Alice Robinson in 1979) and has two children with her: Camille Harley Joan Homme, who will turn 10 on Jan. 17, and Orrin Ryder Homme, 4.\n\nThe Eagles of Death Metal will return to Paris Feb. 16 to play at L’Olympia Bruno Coquatrix.\n\nContact Susan E. Miers Smith: ssmith@readingeagle.com or 610-371-5048.\n\nOriginally Published: January 4, 2016 at 12:00 a.m."
