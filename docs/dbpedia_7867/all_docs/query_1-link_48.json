        "text": "QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE\n\nThe revolving-door music collective Queens of the Stone Age, based around singer-songwriter and guitarist Josh Homme, was one of the most interesting and critically acclaimed hard rock bands of the 2000s. The band's eclectic approach to rock produced arty, blues-based albums that wandered stylistically from gentle acoustic songs and Delta blues stomps to Black Sabbath-like metal and the thick, sludgy garage rock characteristic of early-Nineties grunge bands.\n\nEAGLES OF DEATH METAL\n\nEagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998 by best friends Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme. Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. The story goes that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. With that, the band was born."
