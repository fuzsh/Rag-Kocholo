        "text": "Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme have given their first interview since the deadly attack at Eagles of Death Metal's show at Le Bataclan in Paris on November 13. Speaking with VICE co-founder Shane Smith, they discussed the trajectory of the evening's events-- how the shooting unfolded, the band's reaction, and more.\n\nBoth men are visibly shaken during the interview. Homme was not present at the concert, but Hughes recounts the night, detailing the audience members' bravery amid terror. He says:\n\nSeveral people hid in our dressing room, and the killers were able to get in and they killed everyone except for a kid who was hiding under my leather jacket. … People were playing dead and they were so scared. A great reason why so many were killed is because so many people wouldn't leave their friends. So many people put themselves in front of people.\n\nThe interview also contains fan footage that was recorded at the concert that night, including some jarring clips of what appears to be the first rounds of fire.\n\nWatch the entire interview below, via Vice:"
