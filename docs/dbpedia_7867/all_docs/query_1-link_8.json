        "text": "Bringing Light to an Awesome Band: Eagles of Death Metal\n\nBy Will Wygal - 09/08\n\nNEIRAD enilno edition\n\nLoad printer friendly version\n\nPerhaps, the best side project to ever exist, Eagles of Death Metal is a kickass offshoot band. Featuring members of other bands, they united to create two of the best albums I have ever heard including “Peace, Love, Death Metal” and “Death By Sexy.” The main leaders of the band are Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme though Josh performs under the alias of Carlo Von Sexron.\n\nThe Eagles of Death Metal formed in Palm Desert, California in 1998 and have been rocking out in their stripped jazzy bluegrass style. The band consists of Death Metal consist of Jesse Hughes (The Devil) singing and playing guitar and Josh Homme (Carlo Von Sexron) tearing up drums despite his main instrument being guitar in Queens of the Stone Age. Throughout the years though, they have changed bassists and lead guitarists many times. They have also had contributions from Jack Black, Taylor Hawkins, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, Dave Grohl and many other legendary rockers. If you want a band with a southern rock sound, which is catchy as hell and delicious to the ears, then listen to Eagles of Death Metal. My favorite song is “English Girl” on “Peace, Love, Death Metal.” The song is well structured with lyrics like “ Ooh ooh ooh, And then we dance all through the whole night.”\n\nThey are also one of the most consistently good bands to listen to: they don’t put out filler to complete an album. They’re next album is coming out this year and will be called “Heart On.” The band is blatantly sexual, especially Jess the Devil’s mustache straight out of the 70’s. Their sound is something unusual with an almost unedited sense that makes you feel like the band is always playing for you live right in the middle of the desert. Their message is even more explicit than a fourteen-year-old Britney Spears style of music video. But one key difference is that they are also amazing musicians living through their secret identities. The band is very interesting because it was formed right about the time that Josh Homme got famous with Queens of the Stone Age in the late 1990’s, hence the first Eagles of Death Metal album being released in 2004. When performing live they are known for being “overly charismatic” with the fans and highly energetic. So get excited for the release of “Heart On” arriving sometime this year."
