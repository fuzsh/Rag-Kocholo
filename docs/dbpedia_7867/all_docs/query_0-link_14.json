        "text": "Through his charity The Sweet Stuff Foundation, Josh Homme — co-founder of Eagles of Death Metal and frontman for Queens of the Stone Age and supergroup Them Crooked Vultures — will accept donations to aid victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nEagles of Death Metal Releases First Full Statement After Paris Attacks\n\nEagles of Death Metal were headlining the show at Paris’ Le Bataclan concert hall when terrorists stormed the venue and fatally shot 89 concertgoers, including the band’s merchandise manager Nick Alexander. Homme still plays drums for Eagles of Death Metal’s recording sessions but was not on tour with them during the Paris show and rarely performs with the band.\n\nIn response to the Paris attacks, Homme’s charity will accept donations that will go directly to the victims and their families. According to the foundation’s website, they provide “things like transportation to medical treatment, assistance with childcare and tuition, income assistance, the ‘last wishes’ of a lifetime, and special treatments not covered by insurance.”\n\nThe Sweet Stuff Foundation made the announcement via Twitter:\n\nEagles of Death Metal have put their remaining tour dates on hold until further notice in light of recent events. “Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion,” the band said in its first statement, released Wednesday."
