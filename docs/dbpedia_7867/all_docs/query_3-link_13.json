        "text": "Nice Falcon and signature. I really wish people would sign the lower bout though. Less real-estate for signing. But then they can be played without worry of wearing out the signature from your arm and sweat.\n\nWhile not my favorite Stray Cat material, the 40 album grew on me with multiple listening. It’s not the first time for me. I’ve bought stuff before, didn’t like it. Only to listen years later and end up loving it on the first re-listen. Not sure why.\n\nNice Falcon and signature.

But I'm not so inclined.\n\nStray Cats 40, really enjoying it. I saw them in Ohio last week, great show. Saw the Slim Jim Phantom Trio 2 days later. Very cool. Had him sign my Stray Cats ticket after the show. In retrospect, wish I'd taken my copy of 40 and had him sign that.\n\nSignatures... if I ever were to have anyone sign a guitar (doubtful), I'd have it done on the back. Can always clear over it.

When I google not much comes up.\n\nI agree on the signature thing.\n\nDo you know who his current guitarist was in Slim Jim’s Trio? When I google not much comes up.\n\nI suspect it may (or may not) vary depending on who's available? Tour is interspersed between and near Stray Cats gigs.\n\nIn this case, Guitarist was Josh Homme (Eagles of Death Metal). He did a great job, played a black, highly modified Gretsch Jet (with chrome P90s and script logo) through a Deluxe Reverb. I got to talk to him briefly as they were clearing off the stage, I wanted to find out what pedals he was using. Had a Strymon El Capistan and a Nocturne Jr. Barnyard. Seems like a cool guy.\n\nBass player (and maybe Slim Jim's Girlfriend? ) was Jennie Vee (also sometimes of Eagles of Death Metal, and solo Artist). Talented Artist, and tall pretty blonde. All three sang some.\n\nI need to do a post on the show. I have a pic of the set list and a video or two... not sure if I can upload them here, need to find an online host to link to.\n\nFunny that the individual Stray Cats are touring alongside with their own bands. Setzer and Rockabilly Riot and Slim Jim and his band. What about Lee?\n\nI hope they’re not doing that to prep themselves to stay busy before the next Stray Cats album for the 50th. I’d like another in two or three years. Although I like the solo stuff too.\n\nI suspect it may (or may not) vary depending on who's available?

Don't forget Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss and Them Crooked Vultures.\n\n@thenocturnebrain (aka TV the Wired Turtle) another big name playing your pedal!\n\nJosh Homme is a pretty big name to be playing guitar with that group.

A bit different for him. I'm not familiar with his other bands besides EODM, but a friend mentioned them.\n\nHe was explaining his pedals to me, said \"well this one is a Jr. Barnyard\", and I said \"oh, one of Tavo's\" (it sounded great). He said, \"oh you know him\"? I said \"no, but I've got a couple of his pedals, a Mystery Brain (which interested him) and a Detroit Casket\" (he was unfamiliar so I told him a bit about it, sounded interested).\n\nHe seemed genuinely nice, and definitely liked talking music gear. Jennie and Slim Jim were also very friendly, I really had fun after enjoying a really cool show. Maybe between 100 and 200 people there was all (it was the night before the Woodward Dream Cruise, and this club is on Woodward, there was a lot going on that night)."
