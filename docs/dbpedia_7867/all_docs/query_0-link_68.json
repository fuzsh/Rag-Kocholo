        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age were so unbelievably good on tour from 2000 to 2003, that when one of the multitude of their side projects or “linked” artists blew through your city, you had to go, hoping that a glimmer of that line-up’s brilliance had managed to spread. QOTSA’s first three releases were empirical proof of their rock acumen; they had songwriting, they had chops, they had lethal wit and they knew who exactly to bring aboard for guest spots. The QOTSA seal of approval for a rock band was like a romance novelist getting on the Oprah Book Club reading list. The bands ranged from the good (Mark Lanegan), the bad (Orquesta del Desierto), and still, the ugly (Mondo Generator). At Neumo’s on a chilly October night in Seattle, we were treated to a great double-bill of QOTSA cousins, namely, London’s Duke Spirit and Palm Desert’s Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nQOTSA’s chief producer, Chris Goss, worked on the Duke Spirit’s latest effort, Neptune, at Rancho de la Luna, in Joshua Tree, CA. The Duke Spirit can only be described like five million other bands; they have drums, bass, two guitars and a female vocalist in Liela Moss. They play loud rock and have no gimmicks, nor any hint of ironic detachment. This is music you’ve heard before but it’s music you liked and maybe, didn’t realize you missed. The guitars of Luke Ford and Dan Higgins recall guitar from the alternative explosion of the 90s, that is to say, they’re grimy, loud, and heavily effected. They speak for themselves. This is also where the Spirit share some musical DNA with QOTSA; like Josh Homme, the Duke Spirit have a tendency to lock onto a power chord with a kung-fu death grip and play it until it sounds like it’s gone on for too long before bringing the satisfaction right back.\n\nWhile the indie hemisphere today is filled with quiet, tuneful female singers, there is something unique in Moss’ voice. Her London dialect is fully intact, as when she belts out in “Lassoo,” “You see, it’s in the heavens/ Mercifool forevaa,” that imparts a kind of authenticity that American ears crave. Her pipes are husky and she can coo or shout at the top of her lungs, which makes her seem both vulnerable and dangerous. One can’t take their eyes off of Moss during a performance, her blond hair being a striking counterpoint to the rest of the band’s shadowy males, not to mention her seemingly bottomless bag of percussion tricks and solid harmonica; this is a woman who will be around on iPod playlists for some time to come. When responding to some tawdry shouts from the peanut gallery, a smirking Moss coyly said, “Save your innuendos for the Eagles.”\n\nAs the crew prepared for EODM, one could see the red velor-upholstered amplifier of Dave Catching, longtime desert musician and owner of Rancho de la Luna, who usually handles lead guitar duty on the road. The sex shop aesthetic, combined with the propensity of Jesse “Boots Electric” Hughes and Josh Homme’s EODM studio records to sound like inside jokes at first serves as a reminder that you are not seeing QOTSA tonight but some kind of cheap imitation of that band’s thunder. This quickly ended.\n\nThe final act by the roadie before the set was taping a Jimmy Page action figure to Jesse’s amp. The lights go down and the band takes the stage to the AM Gold sounds of Pilot’s “Magic.” Jesse Hughes, with greasy red hair, aviator sunglasses, and porn mustache, paces back and forth on the stage, miming “Oh, oh, oh, it’s magic/you know/never believe it’s not so.” Tonight, we are in on the joke and like any good joke, it’s funny because it’s true. EODM are incredibly tight live, even with this show being one of the first with QOTSA’s Joey Castillo on drums. Hughes’ modus operandi is to get you to have at least half as much fun as he’s having, to feel a little bit of that ‘magic.’ Kicking off with the new Heart On’s album opener, “Anything ‘Cept the Truth,” the Eagles sometimes sounded like ’70s-era Rolling Stones played at twice the speed. By the time they played Peace, Love, and Death Metal’s “Bad Dream Mama,” where Jessie screams “I want to be your monkey, OW!” anyone with a pulse (or a sense of rhythm) was won over.\n\nHughes was obviously a little nervous, hurriedly pacing from stage left to right and then back again between numbers. After a surprisingly effecting reading of “Now, I’m a Fool,” he shared how happy he was that they were nailing the new material. The man should never be too worried; he’s a master of stoking the audience’s fire, assuring Seattle numerous times that it was the most hard-rockin’ city he’s been to, even after playing “Wannabe in L.A.” He’d remove his Motorhead shirt, throwing it into the crowd before donning a pink one with a tiger’s face. At another point, he pulled a comb from Catching’s (he shaved bald, save for a wisp of a mohawk) back pocket to properly align his hair and mustache.\n\nWhen you read about all the red velor, the porn ‘stache, and the ass-wiggling, you may long for the kind of sweaty, abrasive, muscular rock that Homme has been about lately. But the Eagles of Death Metal give you the most fun you’ll have at a show in a long time, playing it “hot, quick, and tight,” just like Rob Tyner taught us. During the final song, “Speaking in Tongues,” Hughes sang of rock ‘n’ roll as a possessive force commandeering his body and the band stands off while Jesse actually speaks in tongues into the mic, beating Lux Interior at his own game. If seeing a grown man do that live in front of you doesn’t win you over, doesn’t make you believe in ‘magic,’ or believe that for at least ninety minutes that rock is the Ultimate Liberator, then there’s nothing I or Jesse Hughes can do for you."
