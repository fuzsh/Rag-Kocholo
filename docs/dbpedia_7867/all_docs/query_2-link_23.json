        "text": "To be in a room with Josh Homme is to feel like a dog talking to a horse. A really intense horse. He's that much bigger, that much wilder, and with, you suspect, that much larger an appetite for hay. Homme, now 39, still 6'5\", inked and stacked, is so infused with rock machismo that he emasculates his surroundings by proxy. You. The chair. Everything you say. Even the giant pot of coffee he's necking turns into something a squirrel might have had in Sylvanian Families. Yet he looks as if he's about to cry.\n\nThe founding and only continuous member of Queens Of The Stone Age, Homme has had a rough time of it recently. New album …Like Clockwork is the first since 2007's Era Vulgaris, and although some of the intervening time was taken up producing the Arctic Monkeys and playing in Them Crooked Vultures and Eagles Of Death Metal, such a long hiatus was not part of the plan. However, Homme suffered complications during routine surgery on his knee in autumn 2011, later telling journalists he almost died. He was in hospital for 13 days, and bed-ridden for the next four months, during which time he descended into a deep depression.\n\n\"I didn't know if I was gonna come out,\" he says. \"I had a pretty rough three years, but I don't wanna harp on about it because everything for me is just a smaller set of wounds in a grander set of wounds. I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it.\"\n\nHomme had no drive or desire to make a record, but his bandmates let it be known that they were eager. Unable to \"emerge from the fog\", he had little choice but to \"invite them in\". Inevitably, though, the recording process was tough. \"Making records is supposed to be fun,\" muses Homme. \"Even when they're dark, it's fun. But this one was like spelunking – which is supposed to be fun, but really it's just a dark deep cave.\"\n\nIt got tougher when, halfway through, Homme reluctantly fired friend and drummer of 10 years Joey Castillo (he won't divulge the reasons). This was hard but not quite new territory. After 2002's successful Songs For The Deaf, he'd famously had to oust fellow founding member and bassist Nick Oliveri. QOTSA are rock's most fractious brotherhood.\n\n\"By the time you get to your sixth record, some of the benefits of being in a band are grander than ever, but some of the obstacles are just massive. You deal with these lateral subjects and all that is left is the elephant in the room.\" Homme's doing that intense thing again. \"Some people think I must be a jerk because I fired my best friend, but the truth is I went to his house, stared him in the face and I told him how I felt. Can you do that?\" No, we quiver, probably not.\n\n'I think it's obvious to Elton that he creates a certain amount of mania. If six people go to an area before you do, just to check shit out, then there is a certain mania'\n\nYet QOTSA have always had a fluid membership. Oliveri is now back in the fold, singing back-up on If I Had A Tail, while today, we are introduced to the band's newest recruit, a 25-year-old British illustrator called Boneface. Homme chanced upon Boneface's work in the street art magazine Juxtapoz; a few weeks later, he was in California, providing QOTSA with a new visual identity for their sleeves and videos. He also appears to have been assigned the roles of band mascot and in-house stylist. Halfway through our shoot, Homme decides he needs a haircut and marches the band across Soho to commandeer a barber's shop, insisting that Boneface – who keeps his helmet on throughout – be the one to shave his head. \"I don't really know what's going on,\" confides the modest Liverpudlian.\n\nIf ...Like Clockwork's parents were depression and shattered friendship, it had a weird and wonderful midwife to bring it in to the world. Among an illustrious roll call of contributors (longtime collaborators Mark Lanegan, Alex Turner, Trent Reznor and Dave Grohl) was Sir Elton John – an actual queen from the stone age. Sir Elton's assistant, who happened to be Homme's old roommate, played QOTSA to his boss on a long car journey and passed on his number. When Elton called, Homme thought it was a friend fucking with him. It wasn't.\n\n\"I'm shaking hands with Elton John and all the while I'm covering up some gaping social wound because I just fired my drummer four days before. But, you know, what's a little blood among friends? Elton walks in with a big smile, dressed to the nines, arms wide open. So you just go, 'Well how the hell are you doing, babe?' I think it's obvious to him that he creates a certain amount of mania. If six people go to an area before you do just to check shit out, like they did to my studio – and the people that came first were pretty tough motherfuckers, which I enjoy – then there is a certain mania. Whenever I'm in London or Paris and everything is refined, for some reason I feel like a cowboy. Like a dirty American. I love that feeling of being inspected.\"\n\nSir Elton (who had to leave halfway through to record with Englebert Humperdinck, then come back later) plays piano on Fairweather Friends, an unabashedly baroque pitstop on the album that his old pal Freddie Mercury might have dreamed up. ...Like Clockwork is, like Homme himself, a miraculously cohesive mass of idiosyncracies: the bruising, muscular chug of classic QOTSA tries, and fails beautifully, to hold down glimpses of Homme's fragile self, peeking through the record wherever it can find a gap. It is like the man: hard and dark but with a tear in its eye.\n\nFor that reason, it's their best work since Songs For The Deaf, its older, wiser sequel. That's not to say that when it takes its shirt off it couldn't wrestle you to the ground. It's the closing track …Like Clockwork, produced by James Lavelle, that makes the album, embedded as it is with the shrapnel of whatever bomb went off in Homme's head. It's not hidden beneath guitar histrionics or post-apocalyptic lyricism. For the most part, it's just his delicate vocal over a mournful piano. Which makes it both the least and most macho thing he's ever done.\n\n\"I wanna be fully exposed,\" he says. \"I paid for this myself. I took the risk myself. Risk nothing, get nothing. If you wanna be famous, then it's OK if the music is fake, because fame isn't real. If you just wanna take the shortest distance to Kim Kardashian's underwear drawer, then that's fine, too. I'm not even against it. But if you wanna make something real, and you want it to be honest, then you don't have any choice but to take a huge risk.\"\n\n'I'm not trying to be macho. I don't wanna work out with you or some shit. But I like to be a real man'\n\nBesides everything else that's happened since the last QOTSA record, Homme has twice become a father, to a son and daughter with wife Brody Dalle. Has fatherhood mellowed him? \"It hasn't mellowed me. It's stolen me. It's captivated me. I've always been someone who likes to get in the mud and the blood and the dirt, y'know? Now I'm around people that want me to do that. It's what I'm good at.\"\n\nFor him, the roles of dad and rock star are not at odds: \"I'm not a tough guy. But I am six-foot-five, and I don't like to look away. But, y'know, I'm not trying to be macho. I don't wanna work out with you or some shit. But I like to be a real man because I have a son and a daughter and they should know what that's like. It's OK to not be macho. But it's not OK to be a pussy.\"\n\nThere have been highlights in the gloom of the last few years. One in particular didn't involve being a pussy. QOTSA headlined The Other Stage at Glastonbury in 2011 with a set comprised of songs voted for by fans, as a transcendent Beyoncé played the Pyramid Stage just behind them. That night onstage, Josh Homme said something very macho indeed: \"I wanna play so loud that Beyoncé can feel it in her fucking bones.\"\n\nHomme laughs heartily at the memory. \"Ha ha ha! I did? The chances are she might have done. We found out no one wanted to play against Beyoncé. They asked us, and I was like 'OK, hell yeah.' It was great. Or maybe I was just on ecstasy and I didn't know the difference. I walked onstage and was like, 'Wow! Hey everybody! How you doing?'\"\n\nHomme says that people often tell him he must have attention deficit disorder. \"But the truth is, I don't have ADD. I have OKHY: OK, hell yeah.\"\n\nThat tear never does make its way down his face.\n\n…Like Clockwork is out in the UK on Monday"
