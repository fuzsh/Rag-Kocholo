        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age look set to release new music after Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes seemingly confirmed the band have recorded their next album.\n\nJesse founded Eagles of Death Metal with Queens of the Stone Age singer Josh Homme in 1998, with the band going on to release four studio albums. They became more well-known after their 2015 concert at Paris venue The Bataclan was targeted by a terrorist attack in which 90 people were killed.\n\nSpeaking during a recent Instagram livestream which was shared on Reddit, Jesse was asked, “what have you guys been up to?” before simply replying: “Recording”. He went on to say that Eagles are “recording a new record,” before adding: “Queens just did one, we’re doing ours now.”\n\nREAD MORE: Dad stabbed trying to protect son as violence erupts in early hours on street\n\nIt would mark the first new Queens of the Stone Age album since 2017’s Villains. The band recently announced they were releasing a limited edition vinyl reissue of Villains, along with their 1998 self-titled debut and 2013’s ...Like Clockwork, which comes as they have begun announcing tour plans for next year.\n\nThe California rockers are set to appear at Germany’s Southside Festival and Hurricane Festival in June 2023. They were heavily rumoured to be headlining Glastonbury earlier this year, but the apparent confirmation of new music could suggest an appearance on the Pyramid Stage may be on the cards next year.\n\nLast month, Queens frontman Josh was one of many music icons who played at both the London and Los Angeles tribute concerts for Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins. He joined Nile Rodgers for a cover of David Bowie’s Let’s Dance before joining Them Crooked Vultures – his other band with Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones – for a three-song set.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
