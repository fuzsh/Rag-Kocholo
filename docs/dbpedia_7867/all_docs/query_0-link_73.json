        "text": "Members of the Eagles of Death Metal band say they’re home safe after the Paris attacks and “are horrified and still trying to come to terms with what happened in France.”\n\nThe U.S. band was performing at the Bataclan when the deadly attacks occurred. Last Friday’s night of terror in Paris killed 129 people and wounded over 350 others.\n\n“Our thoughts and hearts are first and foremost with our brother Nick Alexander, our record company comrades Thomas Ayad, Marie Mosser, and Manu Perez, and all the friends and fans whose lives were taken in Paris, as well as their friends, families, and loved ones,” the band said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\nEagles of Death Metal released a new album, Zipper Down, last month. They were on a European tour. The band said all shows are on hold until further notice.\n\n“Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion,” the band said."
