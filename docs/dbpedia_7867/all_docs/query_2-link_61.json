A hostage situation unfolded, ending in the slaughter of more than 100 concert goers, the Associated Press reports.\n\nImages show the band onstage at the Bataclan before the deadly attacks began. Source: Marion Ruszniewski /Getty Images\n\nEagles of Death Metal is a two-man band from Palm Desert, California, started in 1998 by guitarist and vocalist Jesse Hughes and percussionist Josh Homme, famous for founding Queens of the Stone Age. Despite their name, the band's sound is closer to garage rock than it is death metal.\n\nAccording to the statement, Eagles of Death Metal's future concerts are on hold \"until further notice.\"\n\nJesse Hughes on stage in New Orleans in 2010 Source: rtnswchegler/mediapunch/AP\n\nCommenting on the post, one Facebook user said he and his wife were among the audience members who escaped the attack.\n\n\"They tried to kill me and my wife while dancing in front of our favorite band, thankfully they failed,\" the commenter wrote. \"We saw what no one should have to see. Our thoughts are with everyone who lost their lives and their relatives. The healing can now begin, and it starts with listening to EODM again. Peace, love and death metal.\"\n\nThe band concluded their statement with a similar mantra, through they wrote theirs in French.\n\n\"Vive la musique, vive la liberté, vive la France and vive EODM.\"\n\nTranslated, the phrase means: \"Long live music, long live freedom, long live France and long live EODM.\"\n\nSource: Mic/Facebook\n\nCorrection: Nov. 18, 2015\n\nAn earlier version of this article stated Eagles of Death Metal formed in 1999. The band formed in 1998."
