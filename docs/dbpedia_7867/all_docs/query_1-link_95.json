        "text": "Josh Homme (of Queens of The Stone Age) has given us Complexity from his side-project Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nThe song is a taste of their forthcoming album Zipper Down, inducing a hallelujah from fans, who haven’t been given a record by these guys since Heart On in 2008. According to Homme, the tune “Is the musical equivalent of holding a lucky rabbit’s foot with the unlucky rabbit still attached,” to which band member Jesse Hughes adds “‘Complexity’ is sort of our way of saying, ‘Keep it simple, stupid’“.\n\nYou can listen to Complexity via Pitchfork here.\n\nHaving just played Download festival over the weekend along with Muse, Kiss and Slipknot, their newest song also anticipates a string of shows across the UK. Tickets will go on sale on Friday the June 19 at 10am.\n\nIf you’re over in England you can catch them on the following dates:"
