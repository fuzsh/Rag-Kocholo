        "text": "When the members of Eagles of Death Metal gave their first interview since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, they vowed to finish their tour and be the first band to play the Bataclan once it reopened. The venue is still on the mends, but it appears Eagles of Death Metal are already returning to the stage.\n\nA source tells Billboard the band will join U2 for its final song at Paris’ AccorHotels Arena — U2 is set to play the venue on Sunday, Dec. 6 and Monday, Dec. 7 — although it’s unclear on which night Eagles of Death Metal will take the stage. And that’s not all — the Paris cameo will include co-founder Josh Homme, who often does not tour with the band and was not present at the Nov. 13 attack. And, adds an insider, Eagles of Death Metal will continue its halted European tour in Feb. 2016.\n\nU2 will also play the AccorHotels Arena the following night, Dec. 7. That same evening, HBO will premiere U2: Innocence + Experience Live in Paris at 9 p.m. (ET). “HBO presents U2 in concert from their current, groundbreaking Innocence + Experience world tour — direct from Paris and only on HBO,” the channel’s official site reads.\n\nBoth Paris shows were originally scheduled for Nov. 14 and 15, but were postponed after the attacks. Bono and his bandmates were extremely supportive of Eagles of Death Metal during the tumultuous weekend, buying them new phones, offering them use of their plane, and providing counsel on what they’d just endured.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age frontman Homme founded Eagles of Death Metal in the late 1990s, along with Jesse Hughes. On Dec. 2, Hughes guested on Homme’s Beats 1 radio show Alligator Hour, and discussed the charity singles artists like the Dean Ween Band have recorded to benefit those affected by the attacks.\n\nThe tragedy on Nov. 13 left 130 dead, 89 of them at Eagles of Death Metal’s Bataclan concert, including merch manager Nick Alexander. The members of the band escaped relatively unscathed. For more of their account of the incident, read Billboard‘s coverage of Eagles of Death Metal’s Nov. 25 interview.\n\nA representative told Billboard that Eagles of Death Metal has no comment on the reports of an appearance with U2 and the 2016 tour."
