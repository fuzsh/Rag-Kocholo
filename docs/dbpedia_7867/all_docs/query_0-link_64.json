        "text": "Jesse Hughes says he had to sell his soul to make rock 'n' roll in Los Angeles.\n\nNow the devil is getting his due.\n\n\"Wannabe in L.A.,\" the new Eagles of Death Metal single, on which Jesse \"The Devil\" Hughes makes his Faustian confession, has been added to MTV's rotation. Radio stations are jumping on it faster than any previous EODM single.\n\nRolling Stone and Spin gave the album from which it came, \"Heart On,\" four stars upon its Oct. 28 debut â€” making it one of the more critically acclaimed CDs with which EODM producer and multi-instrumentalist Josh Homme has been associated.\n\nBut, as deserving as \"Wannabe In L.A.\" is of L.A. anthem status, Hughes isn't ready to buy L.A. real estate just yet.\n\nHis heart is still in the Coachella Valley.\n\nHughes, a Palm Desert High School graduate who was voted Valley's Favorite Musician this year by Desert Sun readers, still calls his Palm Desert condo his primary residence.\n\nHis son attends Washington Charter School. His mother shares his condo. Hughes calls her \"amazing.\"\n\n\"I insisted I'd never ever move to L.A.,\" he said from a living room decorated with images of Elvis Presley, Alice Cooper and Jimmy Page. \"So I've been driving back and forth to L.A. sometimes three or four times a week for the past five years.\n\n\"It allows me to leave Hollywood and return somewhere else. I can come back here and do my dishes and I'm immediately in reality land.\"\n\nL.A. side life\n\nHughes, 36, has come to love L.A., as is evidenced by his songs and his \"Wannabe In L.A.\" video.\n\nHe's roamed the streets and learned the back stories to classic L.A.-inspired songs by groups like Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Eagles.\n\nBut he's also made some true friends in the L.A. rock scene, people he calls \"wizards\" and not \"magicians.\"\n\n\"It's hard to meet anyone that's worth a damn because nobody's from Hollywood,\" Hughes said. \"Everyone's moved there for one reason and it's normally fame. That's the most self-centered reason in the world to do anything.\n\n\"And yet, everywhere I went I was introduced to people who were like, 'Look out for these guys.' The fact that people like Dave Grohl and Jack Black and the greatest friend you could ever ask for, Joshua Homme, exist in rock 'n' roll is unbelievable.\"\n\nHomme, leader of Queens of the Stone Age and a member of the progenitors of stoner rock, Kyuss, when he was still at Palm Desert High School, has been Hughes' best friend since they were in their early teens.\n\nThe six-foot-five Homme protected Hughes from bullies in high school and supported him through a divorce in 2003. When Homme built his own studio in L.A., it became a clubhouse for his pals. Hughes felt accepted there.\n\n\"He (Homme) allowed me the room to grow,\" said Hughes. \"That's rare in Hollywood. He saw a future, he saw a point I could get at and, for whatever reason, he wanted to make damn certain I got there. He's happily let me lead this thing. And for a person of his status, that doesn't have to happen.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal grew out of Hughes' participation in Homme's \"Desert Sessions\" recordings at the Rancho de las Lunas studio in Joshua Tree, now operated by EODM member Dave Catching.\n\nHughes had been in several desert bands, including Jesse's Girls, the blues-based Scary Time Ramblers, the Black List Heroes with Kyuss leader Brant Bjork and Mario Lalli Jr.'s bands, Sort of Quartet and Fatso Jetson.\n\nBut Homme gave him an opportunity to write music and share his rock 'n' roll dream with EODM.\n\n\"I had already given up,\" Hughes said. \"Music was just a hobby for me. I was resigned to that and I didn't care. I had gotten married and I wanted to be a square.\"\n\nHomme says he reached out just because he's always enjoyed Hughes' company.\n\n\"Most of our relationship hasn't involved playing music together,\" he said from L.A. \"It's been about other mutual interests. So, when songwriting was becoming part of his life, I encouraged him because he was my friend and because music is worth chasing after. Whether or not it becomes someone's living is irrelevant.\n\n\"The Jesse I know is intelligent and thoughtless, funny and obnoxious, devious but fragile, insecure yet fearless, selfish but kind and, most of all, creative to the point of fantasy. He's a gifted communicator and someone who is capable of truly understanding exactly what you meant, instead of just hearing the words you said.\n\n\"I guess it's more that I've always believed in him as a person and have found him to be, I guess, more interesting than the next fella.\"\n\nDesert back pages\n\nHughes, born in South Carolina, is an Eagle Scout who participated in the Boys' State youth government program at Palm Desert High School.\n\nHe was editor of the College of the Desert newspaper, contributed stories to The Desert Sun and volunteered for the unsuccessful Senate campaign of the late Sonny Bono, who was a major influence on him.\n\n\"I loved Sonny,\" he said. \"I think he is cut from the same cloth as the founding fathers. I know it sounds corny, but, that dude had principle that he believed in and you could see it in everything he did.\n\n\"And that dude had secrets. He was playing drums on some of the most bad-ass soul sessions you'd ever believe. He did like a Captain Beefheart (album). He had like eight different aliases that he wrote under to split his publishing. He created Cher out of a machine that he'd already built.\n\n\"That's a wizard. Who fights city hall and wins just to get his sign put up. Sonny Bono did.\"\n\nHughes loves the Coachella Valley in part because it could produce a politician like Bono.\n\n\"Our desert mentality is a unique mentality,\" he said. \"Joshua and I take it as a very serious thing. The fact that Sonny Bono could become mayor and Congressman. It says Palm Springs produced a guy who can fight city hall. It also produces the gay capital of the world. It's a beautiful thing, man.\"\n\nGrowth of EODM\n\nHughes and Homme formed EODM as more or less a rock 'n' roll dream.\n\n\"We wanted to live the dream,\" Hughes said. \"We wanted to Led Zeppelin it. Led Zeppelin went on the road and used the intensity of the road and the touring cycle to push their music. So Joshua and I did that. We wanted to live in Amsterdam for a month and record in an amazing studio and we did that, too. We weren't trying to do anything different, we were just trying to do it the same as Little Richard and Angus Young (of AC/DC).\"\n\nThe first two CDs, \"Peace Love Death Metal\" and \"Death By Sexy,\" produced songs that made a lot of money through licensing for TV commercials. \"I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News)\" and \"Speaking in Tongues\" in particular gave EODM a career as concert and recording artists.\n\nBut Hughes felt a need to make their third CD really good.\n\n\"The first two records we recorded took three weeks combined to record and mix,\" he said.\n\n\"This album took a year and a half. This album had to go somewhere. The only way the first two albums wouldn't seem like a joke, is if I could write songs for real.\n\n\"This album is exciting and exhilarating, but, it's weird, man.\n\n\"It's the first one where I feel like I'm going to get my feelings hurt if somebody doesn't like it for real. I worked on these songs. I suffered over them and Joshua and I really took it very seriously. So now it's a different thing. It's my 'art' instead of my album.\"\n\nHomme is happy Hughes is enjoying this success at an age when many rockers are giving it up to get \"real jobs.\"\n\nBut the commercial success still means very little to his relationship with Hughes.\n\n\"When people ask me how we get along,\" Homme said, \"I say: I always have a good time with Jesse and that's because he's so late, gettin' it good is all we got time for.\"\n\nGlance: 'Heart On' highlights\n\n\"Anything 'Cept the Truth\": The opening track and the song that made Hughes and Homme improve their production standards. \"Joshua looked at me and goes, 'OK, this is where we step it up,'\" Hughes said. \"We have to do something with this and take this song somewhere.'\" From then on, they built each song part by part. The song is about espousing Hollywood bravado because \"I've got nothing but everything to prove.\"\n\n\"Now I'm A Fool\": Hughes' first heart-felt ballad about a love affair with a famous person he won't identify. \"It was part of my great love affair with L.A. 'Now I'm A Fool' isn't necessarily that she made me the fool, it's 'Now I'm a Fool' because I've been pursuing this crap and I shouldn't have been. I had to stop it. I had to almost break my own heart to keep her and that was a really big lesson as an adult. She's still one of my best friends.\"\n\n\"Wannabe In L.A.\": \"That's the old sell your soul. I suddenly found myself in a whole different world filled with gypsies. Also, it was my reaction to having to go all the way to Hollywood, the phoniest places in the world, to find some of the most real relationships I'm ever going to have.\"\n\n\"High Voltage\": An infectious groove with the lyrics, \"We're getting freaky in the shadows of the night.\" Hughes says, \"I'm really proud of that one.\"\n\n\"Tight Pants\": A rocker with a falsetto voice singing the refrain, \"I don't want to do what I'm supposed to do/I just want someone to be close to.\" \"That's me,\" said Hughes. \"Therein lies our connection. We're both falsettos. The only song (Homme) really sings on is \"I'm Your Torpedo.\" We do a duet. I love that. I hope people think that I'm singing on Queens now.\""
