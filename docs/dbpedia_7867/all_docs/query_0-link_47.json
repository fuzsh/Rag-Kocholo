        "text": "For many, the Paris attacks that took place Friday night (Nov. 13) will be the first time they’ve heard of the band Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nThe Eagles of Death Metal’s tour schedule reveals the band was scheduled to perform at Le Bataclan concert hall on Friday night, and according to initial Associated Press reports, about 100 people were said to be taken hostage at the venue and at least 15 have died. According to French band Red Lemons, the Eagles of Death Metal band members were not at Le Bataclan at the time of the shootings.\n\nThe Palm Desert, Calif.-based group was formed in 1998 by Queens of the Stone Age bandmates and childhood friends Josh Homme and Jesse Hughes. Homme, also known as Carlo Von Sexron, managed the drums while Hughes helmed vocals and guitar.\n\nDespite their “Death Metal” moniker, the group is known for their edgy blues-rock.Other members include Dave Catching on guitar, Joey Castillo on drums, Samantha Maloney (Motley Crue’s sole female member at one point) on drums and Tim Vanhamel, who guest-starred as a guitarist on Eagles of Death Metal’s 2005 debut, Peace, Love, Death Metal. They released the live performance compilation Live at Slims in 2003.\n\nEagles of Death Metal’s latest release, Zipper Down, charted for a week at No. 59 on the Billboard 200 upon its Oct. 2 release.\n\nThe pair described the project to NME as “Antonio Banderas in Interview With a Vampire meets Brad Pitt.” The 11-track offering also included a cover of Duran Duran’s “Save a Prayer.” The group’s prior releases also made the Billboard 200, with 2006’s “Death By Sexy” enjoyed two weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 113, while 2008’s “Heart On” peaked at No. 57.\n\nThis article first appeared on Billboard.com."
