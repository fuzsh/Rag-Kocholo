        "text": "After cancelling their Barcelona concert last December following the terrorist attacks at their show in Paris, California band Eagles of Death Metal, founded by Josh Homme (frontman of Queens of the Stone Age) and Jesse Hughes, the only permanent members of the group, are in town with their latest album, 'Zipper Down' (2015). The group started out in Palm Desert, California, when the two friends wondered what a mix of The Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. The result was first presented in 2004 with 'Peace Love Death Metal', followed by 'Death by Sexy' (2006) and 'Heart On' (2008)."
