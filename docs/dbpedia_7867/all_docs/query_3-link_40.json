        "text": "Josh Homme, singer, songwriter, and founder of Queens of the Stone Age has heard his band and its music described in many ways. Labels like numetal, stoner rock, alt-metal, and grunge have been applied to the group since the release of its self-titled debut CD in 1998.\n\nIn truth, all of those terms would accurately describe, at one time or another, the band's evolving sound. But when it comes to Homme himself, perhaps the word that best describes the Palm Desert, Calif., native would be \"prolific.\" While most rock artists take a minimum of two years between new albums or tours, Homme always seems to have some musical offering in the works.\n\nThe most recent QOTSA CD, Lullabies to Paralyze was released last March, but Homme has kept his band in the news and in the minds of music fans with a variety of related projects. The band is touring as the supporting act, along with openers Death From Above 1979, on the current Nine Inch Nails tour. During their off nights on the tour, Queens of the Stone Age are playing a few headlining shows, like the one Monday, Nov. 7 at Atlantic City's House of Blues, as well as a series of even smaller secret \"renegade shows\" (announced only on the band's official Web site, www.qotsa.com) at places like bookstores and retail shops.\n\nThe band's version of the Eagles' classic \"In the City\" is included on the soundtrack to the newly released Warriors videogame, based on the 1979 cult-classic Walter Hill film. The Rockstar Games release also features other QOTSA music on the soundtrack. In addition to QOTSA, Homme has a side band called Eagles of Death Metal, and runs his own record label, Rekords Rekords.\n\nBut the date fans have circled on their calendars is Nov. 22 -- that's the day Queens of the Stone Age release Over the Years and Through the Trees, its first live DVD/CD. Filmed mainly during the group's Aug. 22 and 23 gigs at London's Brixton Academy, the band promises lots of extras and behind the scenes footage, including early rarity \"The Bronze\" and \"The Fun Machine,\" a cut temporarily lost during sessions for Lullabies to Paralyze.\n\nThe upcoming release will also include live versions of several songs from another of Homme's side projects, Desert Sessions, a series of double albums featuring a rotating cast of musicians he periodically records with in a remote area near Joshua Tree, Calif. Those tracks include \"I Wanna Make It Wit Chu,\" from Desert Sessions, Vol. 9-10, and an instrumental titled \"Covered in Punk's Blood,\" from Vol. 7-8.\n\nQOTSA decided to film the shows at Brixton Academy because they wanted to do something special for their British fans after having to cancel several London gigs due to a lung infection Homme suffered, as well as the July terrorist attacks.\n\nAn intense connection to the fans is one of the few constants in the world of Queens of the Stone Age. Homme started QOTSA in 1997, shortly after his former group, grunge rockers Kyuss, broke up. Rather than an actual band, Homme envisioned Queens of the Stone Age as more of a collective -- a revolving enclave of his musical friends and utility players, with Homme being the lone fixture. True to form, over the years QOTSA have had so many lineup changes, you'd need a scorecard to keep track.\n\nGuitarist and keyboardist Dave Catching, bassist Nick Oliveri, drummers Alfredo Hernandez, Gene Troutman, and Nicky Lucero, former Screaming Trees bassist Van Conner, Soundgarden's Matt Cameron, Dinosaur Jr.'s Mike Johnson, and ex-Nirvana and current Foo Fighters member Dave Grohl have all come and gone since the band's inception. According to the official Web site, the group is currently comprised of Homme, guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Alain Johannes, plus keyboardist Natasha Schneider and vocalist Mark Lanegan.\n\nThe revolving band members and side projects have all offered Homme an opportunity to explore his eclectic musical nature. Lullabies to Paralyze features guest appearances from a wide range of artists, including Distillers frontwoman (and Homme's fianc√©) Brody Dalle, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, and Shirley Manson of Garbage. The album eschews the drill hammer rock of QOTSA's previous records in favor of a more diverse, and overall darker, bluesier sound. Homme's refusal to be pigeonholed into any one genre has both attracted fans and left some scratching their heads.\n\nIn an interview with MTV.com's James Montgomery, Homme called Lullabies to Paralyze both \"the most important\" and the \"most divisive\" album he's ever made.\n\n\"One of the things you have to do is listen to your detractors a little bit,\" Homme said in the interview. \"You listen to them and understand, and ignore -- because I make music for people who are already into us. I want to take everyone with us, but some people just won't come along. This is just the next Queens record. It doesn't sound like the last one, or the last one before that, because it's not supposed to. It's supposed to sound like a really good mixtape.\"\n\nAfter the Nine Inch Nails tour ends, Homme may need to put his immediate projects on hold. He and Dalle announced last month that they are expecting their first child in January. The news prompted Dalle to disband the Distillers, but given Homme's productive nature, it's a good bet we haven't heard the last from Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age perform at the House of Blues Music Hall on Monday, Nov. 7 at 9pm. Tickets are $30 and are available through Ticketmaster at 1-800-736-1420."
