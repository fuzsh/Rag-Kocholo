        "text": "Photo via Eagles of Death Metal's Facebook\n\nQueens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme welcomed Jesse Hughes, his Eagles of Death Metal bandmate, on to his Beats 1 show last night. In the course of \"Alligator Hour\", the duo discussed their call for covers of \"I Love You All The Time\", which will support victims of the Paris attacks, as well as airing a handful of takes. Listen to the show here.\n\nThe episode concludes with Hughes saying, \"I love you, Baby Duck.\" Homme replies, \"I love you too.\" After a moment's silence, Jeff Buckley's \"Hallelujah\" plays them out.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Hughes' and Hommes' closing remarks."
