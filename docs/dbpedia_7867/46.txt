Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme appeared live with Eagles Of Death Metal.

Homme originally formed the band with Jesse Hughes in 1998, releasing their debut album ‘Peace, Love, Death Metal’ in 2004, followed by ‘Death By Sexy’ in 2006 and ‘Heart On’ in 2008. Due to his commitments to his other bands, however, Homme rarely plays live with the group.
