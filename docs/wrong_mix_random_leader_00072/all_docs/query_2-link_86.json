        "text": "BILLIE’S BEDTIME STORY\n\nMulti-award-winning singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is joining the roster of celebrity readers for the CBeebies Bedtime Story slot on BBC pre-school network CBeebies. Eilish will read “This Moose Belongs to Me” by author and illustrator Oliver Jeffers. The story follows Wilfred, a young boy who believes he owns a moose named Marcel. Eilish introduces the tale by sharing her love for both music and nature.\n\nThe narrative takes a turn when someone else claims ownership of Marcel during a woodland adventure, teaching Wilfred a valuable lesson. Eilish summarizes the moral, stating: “We need to look after beautiful, wild creatures like Marcel, but we also need to let them do their own thing.”\n\nEilish will make her debut on the popular children’s program on July 19. CBeebies Bedtime Story, a staple of British children’s television since 2002, airs weekdays on CBeebies and is available on BBC iPlayer. The program has featured numerous high-profile guests, including Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, Kate Winslet, Chris Hemsworth, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Reynolds, Dolly Parton, Orlando Bloom, Elton John and Ed Sheeran.\n\nADAPTATION\n\nJapan’s Nippon TV and the Philippines’ ABS-CBN are joining forces to bring the hit Japanese drama “Mother” to Filipino audiences. The adaptation, titled “Saving Grace,” marks the 10th international version of the series and will star Julia Montes in the lead role.\n\n“Mother” first aired on Nippon TV in 2010, garnering awards and critical acclaim. Since then, it has become a widely exported format, with adaptations in Turkey, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand, China, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Mongolia.\n\nThe plot follows a teacher who abducts a young student suffering from abuse, leading to a national manhunt. “Saving Grace” is slated to begin production soon, with a planned 2025 air date.\n\nEXPANSIONS\n\nThe London TV Screenings is set to grow for its 2025 edition, running from Feb. 23-28. The U.K. distribution event will kick off with Studiocanal‘s showcase and continue with events from founding distributors All3Media International, Banijay Entertainment, Fremantle and ITV Studios.\n\nSome 30 companies will participate, offering free, curated events across Leicester Square, Soho and Covent Garden. Attendees can expect exclusive previews of scripted and non-scripted content, including formats, and opportunities to connect with industry talent.\n\nThe event is growing in prominence, with a 50% increase in buyer attendance in 2024, totaling over 750 participants. The expanded schedule aims to accommodate the rising number of participating distributors and studios.\n\nAdding to the city’s growing industry presence, RX France recently announced plans to bring Mip London to the British capital in 2025, where it will run alongside the London Screenings Feb. 24-27.\n\nThe full lineup for the 2025 London TV Screenings will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n***\n\nBBC Studios and Samsung TV Plus are broadening their partnership, extending two BBC FAST channel brands across the EMEA region. BBC Drama is set to debut in MENA on Samsung TV Plus, while motoring series “Top Gear” is launching on the platform in MENA, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nBBC Drama, already available in Spain, Italy, and France on Samsung TV Plus, will bring award-winning British content to MENA viewers. The channel’s lineup includes period drama “Call The Midwife,” Caribbean-set crime series “Death in Paradise” and family drama “The Durrells.”\n\n“Top Gear” is expanding its FAST channel presence to MENA, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Denmark on Samsung TV Plus. This move follows the show’s successful launch on the platform in Benelux and its availability on Pluto TV in the same markets."
