We will consider the function of poetry to document, bear witness, and to effect what Seamus Heaney called “the redress of poetry. Along with reading poems that take up the subject, we will read several essays to undergird our discussion of the ethics of representation, positionality, and what it means to write about violence and trauma. In all of this, we will focus on the craft of writing poetry—metaphor, image, musicality, voice, etc.—with a focus on ekphrasis and intertextuality which will engage students in responding both to the works of art in the exhibition and the poems we will read in the course.\n\nTeaching Methods: A mixture of workshop and discussion of assigned reading.\n\nEvaluation Methods:\n\nProcess Essay drafts/weekly poem assignments - 30%\n\nAbility to Critique/Class Participation - 20%\n\nFinal Portfolio: journal, 6-8 poems, final essay - 50%\n\n(Reading Journal - 20%)\n\n(Poems and final craft/process essay - 30%)\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Humanities in conjunction with the Block Museum.\n\nEnglish 307Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of the TaleBouldrey\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20\n\nEnglish 307 Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of the Tale\n\nCourse Description: In 207, you have learned to apply the basic building blocks of fiction—character, plot, point of view, scene and summary—to write your own stories. We learn the great bromide \"Show, don't tell!\" In this advanced course we will buck the bromide, and learn how to tell. We will brush up some of that previous knowledge, and build on that material and experience while continuing and deepening the apprenticeship to great writers, both contemporary and classic. Students will read some examples of great taless both classic and contemporary, and will write several exercises and two stories during the quarter.\n\nIn addition, good writers learn their craft through extensive critical reading. Through close study, critique, and imitation of many different kinds of writers, you can push the boundaries of your own abilities and discover new ways to create fiction. Each week, I will assign two or three stories that focus on some advanced topics in writing, including “What Makes a Tale Satisfying?”, “Using Objects in Fiction”, “Staying on the Surface”, “Villains”, “Using Jokes as a Way to Tell a Story”, and “Reading for Writers”.\n\nTeaching method: Lecture, discussion, workshop\n\nEvaluation methods:\n\nCreative Work (50%)\n\nShort Papers (30%)\n\nClass participation and attendance, including workshop (20%)\n\nReadings may include: Work by Jennifer Egan, Isak Dinesen, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, the Gilgamesh poet, Chaucer, Rebecca Curtis, Charles and Mary Lamb, Julia Elliott, and Toni Morrison, Yiyun Li, Rabindranath Tagore, and all will be made available as pdf files.\n\nEnglish 307Advanced Fiction Writing: What Happens Next? Structure, Plot, and Suspense in Short FictionKokernot\n\nTTh\n\n9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 307 Advanced Fiction Writing: What Happens Next? Structure, Plot, and Suspense in Short Fiction\n\nCourse Description: You can write a beautiful sentence, bust out of the gate with an enticing premise, and clairvoyantly reveal your character’s rich interior life to say something profound about the human condition---but at some point your story loses momentum and fizzles out. Answering the simple question of “What happens next?” is a powerful impulse that drives us as readers, and it should likewise, drive us as writers. Learn to grow your brilliant ideas into tense, invigorating stories. Put your beautiful sentences to work in the service of plot and character. And dive deep into a character during moments of conflict.\n\nStudents will explore structure, plot, and suspense through a variety of interdisciplinary, playful writing exercises that employ visual media and also other texts, encouraging spontaneity while adhering to constraints of form. Be prepared to write at least one full-length story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n\nTextbooks Will Include: Thrill Me by Benjamin Piercy. PDFs of short stories and excerpts from longer texts available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 308Advanced Nonfiction Writing: The Video EssayBresland\n\nMW\n\n2-3:20\n\nEnglish 308 Advanced Nonfiction Writing: The Video Essay\n\nCourse Description: In this course we will practice a cutting-edge form of nonfiction at the intersection of documentary, literature, experimental film and video art. We will apply literary techniques to the composition of short multimedia essays and explore the many ways in which writing with image and sound differs from writing for the page. Like its print counterpart, the video essay is an attempt to see what one thinks about something. The video essay may engage with fact, but tends to be less self-assured than documentary. Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, “wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth.” Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term cinécriture, or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script. Choosing images, designing sound—these, too, were part of that process. At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses. The goal of this course is to better understand how the act of writing is shaped and, in best cases, furthered, by visual and sonic elements. We will author our own short video essays and will, in the process, learn to record and edit video, produce layered soundscapes, and use our voices as tools of performance.\n\nTeaching Method: Students produce four multimedia sketches for this course (a soundscape, a still-image essay, a video portrait, and an object diary), write an audio/visual script, then produce a roughcut video essay or short documentary based on that script, to be followed by a complete, polished film. Readings, screenings and auditions of peer work comprise a substantial share of class sessions.\n\nTexts include: Films by Laurie Anderson, John Akomfrah, William Burroughs, Raoul Peck, Slavjov Zizek, Ross McElwee and many more, all available via NU.\n\nEnglish 309Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of ObsessionMun\n\nTTh\n\n12:30-1:50\n\nEnglish 309 Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of Obsession\n\nCourse Description: Much of writing is made up of obsessions. We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer’s life, said it simply: “You have to be obsessed. It’s not something you’d want to be—it’s rather something you couldn’t help but be.” In this course we’ll explore “obsession” from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we’ll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to—from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind’s eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we’ll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.\n\nStudents will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story. This class is for serious writers who are unafraid of taking real risks, unafraid of true rewrites/revisions, unafraid of working hard toward turning a good story or an essay into a great one.\n\nTeaching Method: Workshop.\n\nEvaluation Method: Creative writing assignments, peer-reviews, and reading responses, workshop participation.\n\nText Include: Coursepack and books.\n\nCoursepack will be available at: Quartet Copies\n\nInstructor Bio: Nami Mun was raised in Seoul, South Korea and Bronx, New York.

We are the inheritors, perpetuators and innovators of literary culture, and in this class, we will position our inquiries on the present and future, even as we acknowledge the enduring humanistic values of creative writing. We will begin with a discussion of ideas about shaping the literary traditions of the United States starting with Melville, and moving quickly to those who have led or lead in shaping that tradition by shaping it or walking away from it—Roxane Gay, Adrienne Rich, Richard Baldwin, and others. Then we will build on these ideas practically with a service learning assignment and a creative work that reaches a new public, coordinates new media or engenders community. Our class will be enhanced by the annual Return Engagement series, featuring visits and readings from alumni of Northwestern’s Writing Program. My intention is to have a conversation that will unfold in real-time between us all, and will evolve into a learning experience that is both pragmatically useful and philosophically illuminating. My hope is that this class will help us to become more conscious of our motives and processes as writers; that it will allow us to more lucidly defend creative writing as an art form and a vital contribution to society; and that it will acquaint us with the productions of literary culture, including their changing technological platforms and their relationship to social structures. This course is part of the Hewlett Diversity Initiative, and as part of this program, we will investigate literature and culture through the lens of social inequalities and diversities.\n\nEnglish 393-1Theory and Practice of PoetryGibbons\n\nMW\n\n3:30-4:50\n\nEnglish 393-1 Theory and Practice of Poetry\n\nCourse Description: This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students 64 Return to Calendar increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry. The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry -- including description, rhetoric, story and song -- and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

We’ll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we’ll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we’ll be reading mostly to steal: we’ll figure out what works and we’ll use it for our own material. We’ll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we’ll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people’s scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we’re doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you’ll get.\n\nTeaching Method: Lectures, discussion, small- and large-peer workshops.\n\nEvaluation Method: This is a portfolio- and participation-based course.

A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference. The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us appreciate literature not as leisure reading but as challenging, bold, funny, even utopian political thought articulated through new representational forms.\n\nThe class is structured in units with key texts accompanied by corollary short documents aimed to illuminate the text’s historical and literary meanings. Central readings (some excerpted) include: Beowulf; Geoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales; Thomas More, Utopia; William Shakespeare, The Tempest and sonnets; John Donne, Andrew Marvell, poems; John Milton, Paradise Lost; Aphra Behn, Oroonoko; Eliza Haywood, Fantomina; Jonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels; Olaudah Equiano, Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African.\n\nEnglish 210-2English Literary Traditions, Part 2Froula\n\nMW\n\n1-1:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 210-2 English Literary Traditions, Part 2\n\nCourse Description: This course surveys highlights of British literature from the Romantic Poets through the Victorian writers to the radical innovations of Modernism and beyond. We'll read some famous and popular works of English literature, such as Jane Austen’s classic Pride and Prejudice, John Keats's great Odes, R. L. Stevenson’s shocking Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and T. S. Eliot’s revolutionary poem The Waste Land, in light of surrounding developments, conflicts, and debates: rising industrialization, nationalism, and imperialism; emerging media, transportation, and warfare technologies; political resistance and revolution; language, art, and translation in an ever-\"shrinking\" world. This course fulfills a gateway requirement for the English Major and a WCAS distribution requirement (Area VI).\n\nTeaching Method: Two weekly lectures and one weekly discussion section.\n\nRequirements and evaluation: Weekly Canvas reading posts compiled as midterm (15%) and final (15%), short paper (20%), final paper (30%), quizzes and class participation (20%).\n\nRequired texts, available at Norris Bookstore: The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Major Authors 10th ed., Vol. 2 ISBN 9780393603095; Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (Penguin, 2002) ISBN 9780141439518.\n\nNOTE: You must acquire the specific editions ordered for class because selections, chapters, and page numbers vary from edition to edition.

Theories of poetry from antiquity to the present day have grappled with these two dimensions of the poetic experience. In order to understand a poem, a reader must, in some sense, enter into its unique and complex logic, while nevertheless remaining open to the sometimes unsettling ways it can surprise us. In this class, we will read some of the greatest lyric poems written in English, as we systematically develop an understanding of the formal techniques of poetic composition, including diction, syntax, image, trope, and rhythm. Students should come prepared to encounter poems as new and unfamiliar terrain (even if you've read a particular poem before), as we methodically work through the formal elements of the poetic process.\n\nTeaching Method: Lectures and required weekly discussion sections.\n\nEvaluation Method: Weekly (w)reading exercises; one 5-7 page paper; final project; final exam.\n\nRequired Texts: Course packet available at Quartet Copies and on Canvas.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Comp Lit 211.\n\nEnglish 213Introduction to FictionJohnson\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 213 Introduction to Fiction\n\nCourse Description: What is fiction? What is fiction for? What is the relationship between fictional worlds and the real one? These are the questions that we will explore in this class. Reading both essential works of fiction and important theories of fiction, we will seek to understand the construction and purpose of these other literary worlds, as well as the social and political importance of reading this world otherwise.\n\nTeaching Method(s): lecture with required TA-led discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Short essay, midterm exam, final exam, quizzes and participation.\n\nTexts include: Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four; Jamaica Kincaid, A Small Place; Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein; Ahmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad.\n\nTexts will be available at: Bookends & Beginnings, 1716 Sherman Avenue.\n\nEnglish 234Introduction to ShakespearePhillips\n\nMW\n\n12:30-1:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 234 Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to a range of Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, histories and romances. During the quarter, we will be considering these plays in their Early Modern context—cultural, political, literary and theatrical. We will focus centrally on matters of performance and of text. How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare’s various “texts”— his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience? Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examining some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, and the Tempest.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lectures with discussion; required weekly discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Attendance and section participation, short papers, a scene performance, midterm, final exam.\n\nTexts will be available at: Beck’s Bookstore. The required textbook is The Norton Shakespeare, 3rd ed. Stephen Greenblatt et al. ISBN 978-0393934991 (approximate cost $95 new; $48 used; copies of the 1st and 2nd editions may also be used).\n\nEnglish 270-1American Literary Traditions, Part 1Grossman & Stern\n\nTTh\n\n11-12:20, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 270-1 American Literary Traditions, Part 1\n\nCourse Description: This is part one of a two-quarter survey that covers writings produced in North America between the time Native peoples encountered Europeans for the first time and the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the first quarter we’ll explore the history of North American literature from its indigenous beginnings—including the migration by Europeans to what they imagined as a “new world”—through the crisis of slavery in the mid-1850’s. We will be centrally engaged with a set of related questions: What is American literature? Who counts as an American? Who shall be allowed to tell their stories, and on whose behalf? We embark on this literary journey at a moment of questioning the relations between the present and our “literary traditions”: various organizations are debating how to commemorate the four hundredth anniversaries of the years 1619 (the year the first ship bearing enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia) and 1620 (the year of the Plymouth settlers’ landing in what is now Massachusetts); at the same time, people are calling for the removal of monuments to Christopher Columbus and to the Confederacy. We will be reading authors that canonical literary histories have usually included—Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Frederick Douglass, and Nathaniel Hawthorne—alongside Native American authors who told stories of European encounter and African American accounts that radically contest the meanings of some of the key terms of U.S. literature, history, and culture: discovery, citizenship, representation, nation, freedom.\n\nTeaching Method: Two lectures per week, plus a required discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method: Evaluation will be based on two short (3-page) essays, in which students will perform a close reading of a literary passage from one of the texts on the syllabus; a final examination, involving short answers and essays; and active participation in section and lecture. Attendance at all sections is required.\n\nSome of the authors whose works we will read include: Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Christopher Columbus, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Benjamin Franklin, Phillis Wheatley, Powhatan.\n\nNote: English 270-1 is an English Literature major and minor requirement; it is also designed for non-majors and counts as an Area VI WCAS distribution requirement.\n\nEnglish 270-2American Literary Traditions, Part 2Grossman & Stern\n\nMW\n\n12-12:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 270-2 American Literary Traditions, Part 2\n\nCourse Description: This course is the second part of a survey of American literature covering the decade preceding the Civil War to 1900. In lectures and discussion sections, we shall explore the divergent textual voices--white and black, male and female, poor and rich, enslaved and free--that constitute important strands of the literary tradition of the United States in the nineteenth century. Central to our study will be the following questions: What does it mean to be an American in 1850, 1860, 1865, and beyond? Who speaks for the nation? How do the tragedy and the triumph of the Civil War inflect American poetry and narrative? And how do post-bellum writers represent the complexities of democracy, particularly the gains and losses of Reconstruction, the advent of and resistance to the \"New Woman,\" and the class struggle in the newly reunited nation?\n\nTeaching Method: Two lectures per week, plus a required discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method: Evaluation will be based on two short (3-page) essays, in which students will perform a close reading of a literary passage from one of the texts on the syllabus; a final examination, involving short answers and essays; and active participation in section and lecture. Attendance at all sections is required.\n\nTexts may include: Herman Melville, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street\"; Rebecca Harding Davis, \"Life in the Iron Mills\"; Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl; Emily Dickinson, selected poems; Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself” and other selected poems; Charles Chestnut, selected tales; Kate Chopin, The Awakening.\n\nNote: English 270-2 is an English Literature major and minor requirement; it is also designed for non-majors and counts as an Area VI WCAS distribution requirement.\n\nEnglish 273Introduction to 20th Century American Literature (TTC)Nadiminti\n\nMW\n\n12:30-1:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 273 Introduction to 20th Century American Literature (TTC)\n\nCourse Description: After asserting its “manifest destiny” in the nineteenth century, the United States became an unprecedented global power in the twentieth century, especially after World War II. In 1941, the publisher Henry Luce went so far as to coin the phrase “the American century” to describe the new role of the emerging superpower in world affairs. For some, the US became the “indispensable nation,” “world leader,” and an exceptional international figure. For many others, such as the people of the Philippines or Vietnam or Iraq, it became a cruel and coercive imperial force. This course studies how the historical fact of US empire influenced literature and expressive culture. We will examine how both domestic and international writers most impacted by imperial violence—such as Filipino migrant laborers, the descendants of interned Japanese-Americans, or Afghani and Pakistani diaspora in the US—contest the language of empire that the U.S. used to define itself. What kinds of stories, prison memoirs, protest poems, graphic novels, and other aesthetic forms have emerged out of the desire for more truthful counter-narratives? How has the geography of United States empire shaped and informed the multiracial experience of both its populations and those abroad?\n\nWhile the course thinks through Asian American and postcolonial diaspora in South Asia and the so-called Middle East, it also encourages students to think about US imperial effects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to and learn to grapple with complex theoretical and historical concepts like settler colonialism, Cold War militarism, post-9/11 counterinsurgency, extraterritorial internment, and neoliberal hegemony. Along the way, we will ask large questions about the function of literature such as: what makes a work of art political? What kinds of aesthetic strategies do writers and artists use in their presentation of the political? What does it mean for literature to be performing resistance? Assignments will include one close-reading paper, one theoretical reading paper, pop quizzes, robust sections participation, and a final exam.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nCarlos Bulosan, America Is In The Heart (Political Novel)\n\nMiné Okubo, Citizen 13666 (Graphic Memoir)\n\nSinaan Antoon, The Corpse Washer (Contemporary Novel)\n\nMohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist (Contemporary Novel)\n\nLing Ma, Severance (Science Fictional Novel)\n\nJerome Tubiana and Alexandre Franc, Guantánamo Kid (Graphic Biography)\n\nEnglish 275Intro to Asian American Literature (ICSP)Huang\n\nTTh\n\n9:30-10:50, plus discussion section\n\nEnglish 275 Intro to Asian American Literature (ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: Asian American, Asian-American, Asian/American: from Chinese Americans to Hmong Americans to mixed race Asian Americans, from fourth-generation Californians to cosmopolitan college students, from desert internment camps to New York City office buildings, what do the many subjects and locations of Asian American literature tell us about the capaciousness of the category itself? This class has two goals—first, providing an overview of literature written by Asian Americans in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries and placing these texts in conversation with key concepts from Asian American culture and history. Second, interrogating the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of Asian American identity, a category that came into use only in the 1960s as a coalitional entity defined by shared histories of labor, discrimination, and national and cultural unbelonging.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lecture, Discussion\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Regular reading responses; two short essays; one long essay; active class participation\n\nTexts (subject to change; please confirm final text list on Canvas before purchasing):\n\nDavid Henry Hwang, M.

We will take a historical approach, examining how Latinx writers from various communities (Puerto Rican, Mexican American, Cuban American, Dominican American, Colombian American) have understood their relationship to the United States from the late nineteenth century up to the present. We will also question the category of Latinx. How do the experiences and histories of the various groups described under that label benefit from and/or resist identification as a single ethnicity? Most importantly, we will ask what poetry, memoirs, and novels have to offer as a way of understanding Latinx experiences. By the end of the quarter students will have an overview of the heterogeneous literary voices and aesthetics that constitute US Latinx literature.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar/Discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Attendance, class participation, readings, writing assignments, presentations final paper.\n\nTexts may include:\n\nVida by Patricia Engel, I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika Sánchez.\n\nTell Me How it Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions by Valeria Luiselli\n\nBodega Dreams by Ernesto Quiñonez\n\nPoetry, essays, and short stories by Urayoán Noel, Elizabeth Acevedo, Gloria Anzaldúa, Sandra María Esteves, among others.\n\nTexts will be available at Norris Bookstore and via Canvas.\n\n300-LEVEL LITERATURE COURSES\n\nEnglish 300Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Ideas of JusticeSchwartz\n\nMW\n\n9:30-10:50\n\nEnglish 300 Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Ideas of Justice\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce you to literary studies with a focus on ideas of justice. Library works will include the classical tradition, the biblical tradition, and Shakespeare who inherited both and reworked them in the early modern period. The trial of Socrates, the trial of Jesus, biblical prophecy, tragedy in Shakespeare, and modern works by Melville, Kafka, and the play, “Inherit the Wind” will be included. Reading closely, we will heed how literature offers elaborations and complications of theories of justice, as they shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will also put literature in dialogue with strands of political thought, showing how literature both reflects and shapes ideas of justice.\n\nTeaching method: Seminar\n\nNotes: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

From Beyoncé to Lynyrd Skynyrd, soul food to new south cuisine, Flannery O’Connor to Natasha Trethewey, this course looks at the ways cultural production from the second half of the twentieth century to today has sought both to cling to a nostalgic sense of Southernness and to challenge that notion, imagining the region anew and (re)claiming it in the process. The course engages culturally diverse, multi-media and multi-genre texts about the U.S. South. We will read poems, short stories, Kiese Laymon’s novel Long Division (2013), recipes, blog posts, and music videos through the theoretical lenses of sociology, black feminism, ecocriticism, and food studies, exploring different methodological approaches to the study of literature and popular culture.\n\nTeaching Methods: Seminar discussion, collaborative group work.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, short papers, in-class presentation, paper proposal oriented around a chosen theoretical framework.\n\nTexts include: Flannery O’Connor, “Everything That Rises Must Converge” (1965); Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, Vibration Cooking or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl (1970); Natasha Trethewey, selected poems from Native Guard (2006); Kiese Laymon, Long Division (2013); Beyoncé, Lemonade (2016).\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris Bookstore and on Canvas.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

In the early nineteenth century, murder, madness, and illicit sexuality were often confined to remote Gothic castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the rise of sensation fiction in Britain and detective stories in the United States, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded the supposedly blissful domestic scene. Writers also started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about whose deaths were grievable. Beginning with bestselling authors Wilkie Collins and Edgar Allen Poe, this seminar follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), mid-twentieth-century thrillers by Daphne du Maurier, and gritty detective fiction by Chester B. Himes. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, the course will conclude with a survey of current chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins, Oyinkan Braithwaite, and others. Readings will be supplemented with films and prestige dramas, including the 2016 adaptation of The Girl on the Train and 2020’s The Undoing.\n\nTexts include:\n\nThe Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins (9780735219755)\n\nMy Sister, The Serial Killer, by Oyinkan Braithwaite (9780525564201)\n\nCotton Comes to Harlem, by Chester B. Himes (9780394759999)\n\nTexts will be available at Beck's.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration.

In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for crucial questions that literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity. Beginning with classical mythology and the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of possession, including William Shakespeare’s Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley’s The Devils of Loudon (1952), the story of a famous reported demonic possession at a French convent. We will go on to study the possessions and hauntings staged in Edgar Allen Poe’s short stories and Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying what it means to be denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison’s Beloved (1987), James Baldwin’s essays, and Natasha Trethewey’s Native Guard (2008). These texts invite analysis of the dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of a narrative.\n\nThroughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on different literary genres. Students will also learn how we can interpret texts in conjunction with major schools of thought in literary criticism and theory.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

As climate catastrophe alters our relationship to the edges of conventional maps, the immense scale and distance of the North and South Poles have long inspired imaginations across the globe, even as they test the limits of our attention as well as our capacity for action. What do human representations of polar spaces tell us—south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic—about our relationship to space, environment, and climate? In this course, we will explore the most prominent of Polar genres, the travel narrative, to better understand how these places shape, and are shaped by, our political, aesthetic, and ethical understanding. Examining the sublime appeal of icy solitude figured in Romantic poetry and modern science fiction, working with archival materials of failed Victorian expeditions, and reading Inuit novels memorializing ways of life threatened by outside intrusions, we will consider the power of various narrative mediums and technologies to cultivate care for the distant, the invisible, and the potentially catastrophic. By investigating how our cultural conceptions of ice have evolved over time, we will come to appreciate how narrative is turned to, time and again, to render the far away nearby, as well as learn how we might more effectively take up narrative now as these climes face crisis.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Short writing assignments and final (group or individual) creative project.\n\nTexts Include: Tete-Michel Kpomassie, An African in Greenland; Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness; Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk, Sanaaq; Yuri Rutkheu, When the Whales Leave; Tanya Tagaq, Split Tooth; and selections by Edmund Burke, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Ada Blackjack, Gwendolyn MacEwan, and Apsley Cherry-Gerrard.\n\nAvailable at: Norris; additional readings available through Canvas.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the French-speaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in positions of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the Conqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became beef and pork and mutton – at least when they were served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other words associated with aristocratic life, these terms all derive from French. In this course we will investigate this and many other milestones in the history of the English language, focusing on the period from the early middle ages through the eighteenth century. We will pay particular attention to the relationships among “high” and “low” forms of language, including efforts to elevate the status of English and the dynamics of self-consciously “low” registers of language such as slang and obscenity. In addition to offering an introduction to the linguistic, literary, and social history of England, this course will help you to develop a more sensitive understanding of modern English that you can bring to other classes and to life in general.\n\nTeaching Methods: Mostly discussion, some lecture.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Midterm and final examinations, paper, short written exercises, oral presentation.\n\nTexts may include: Tore Janson, The History of Languages, ISBN 978-0-19-960429-6, plus readings and videos posted to Canvas\n\nEnglish 310Studies in Literary Genres: Subversive Forms: Satire (Pre-1830)Thompson\n\nMW\n\n11-12:20\n\nEnglish 310 Studies in Literary Genres: Subversive Forms: Satire (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: What do Jonathan Swift’s pamphlet A Modest Proposal and Jordan Peele’s horror film Get Out have in common? This class examines the genre that Swift and Peele exploit to devastating effect: satire. We’ll devote special attention to satire’s key paradox: for those who get it (or think they do), satire signifies by not signifying what it literally says. We’ll explore the long history of satire to ponder its ethical concerns with social and political life; sexuality, sex work, and marriage; social class, corruption, and criminality; and empire and race. The class ends with contemporary film and TV, including Get Out and Black Mirror.\n\nTeaching method: Discussion.\n\nEvaluation method: Two short essays (5 pages); one medium essay (7 pages); intermittent Canvas posts; participation in class discussion.\n\nRequired texts list:\n\n[any additional readings will be available on Canvas]\n\nJane Austen, Northanger Abbey.

Essentially litmus tests of social feeling, these plays reflect on the slow dismantling of empire, demographic shifts, strained or nascent institutions, and political regime change in brilliant exposés of national character. More recently, this genre has also been used to register the project of cultural pluralism (and its discontents) and Britain's place in the world. Because the plays are staged, they provide outstanding ways to examine narrative and metaphor's reception in a constantly changing political landscape.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): close reading assignments (including final paper) and participation.\n\nTexts include: Priestley, The Linden Tree; Osborne, Look Back in Anger; Wesker, The Kitchen; Behan, The Hostage; Beyond the Fringe; Storey, The Contractor; Edgar, Destiny; Brenton, The Romans in Britain; Churchill, Top Girls; Pinter, Party Time; Agbeje, Gone too Far!; Bartlett, King Charles III; Hickson, Oil; Kalnejais, This Beautiful Future.\n\nTexts will be available at: Canvas.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Theatre 340.\n\nEnglish 312Studies in Drama: Katherine Dunham (Post-1830/ICSP)Manning\n\nF\n\n10a-12:50p\n\nEnglish 312 Studies in Drama: Katherine Dunham (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This seminar explores the life and work of Katherine Dunham, an African-American dancer, choreographer, anthropologist, writer, and political activist. Dunham came of age in the milieu of the Chicago Renaissance, collaborating with Black and white artists to create a new style of dancing based on her ethnographic research in the Caribbean. During the years surrounding World War II she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization. In 1965 Dunham settled in East St. Louis, where she trailblazed methods for using the arts to engage and uplift youth in the community. The class time will be split between movement and discussion. In addition to guest teachers in Dunham technique, students in this course will encounter the full range of primary sources for dance studies—film and video, oral history and memoir, unpublished manuscripts and correspondence, exhibitions of visual material, digital databases. There will also be several co-curricular outings integrated into this course—from an exhibit at the Newberry Library to a panel at the Modernist Studies Association. Previous dance training is not required, as long as students have a passion for this inquiry into embodiment and cultural history!\n\nCourse costs: Joanna Dee Das, Katherine Dunham; Dance and the African Diaspora (Oxford University Press, 2017) hardcover ($35) or ebook ($15) ISBN: 9780190264871, and KAISO!

This class will consider Jane Austen’s development as a writer, in the context of the “culture wars” in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. Is Austen a radical or conservative novelist? Does she defend the values of a dying aristocracy, or champion a new middle class sensibility? How does she respond to the jarring changes affecting her society? Does she assert the privileges of the governing classes or urge the rights of silenced groups (especially young women)? Does she offer a traditional or progressive view of marriage? Should children make their own choices in marriage or defer to parental authority? How do her novels cultivate good judgment? Do the arts have a progressive role in transforming society or a conservative one in maintaining traditional values? These are some of the questions we will examine as we read a range of her novels. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen’s thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Seminar, Discussion, Lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Participation, Midterm Paper, Final Paper.\n\nTexts include:\n\nMary Wollstonecraft, Vindication of the Rights of Woman (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 019955546X; ISBN-13: 978-0199555468)\n\nEdmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (Penguin ---- ISBN-10: 0140432043; ISBN-13: 978-0140432046)\n\nJane Austen, Northanger Abbey (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 019953554X; ISBN-13: 978-0199535545)\n\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (Norton Critical Edition ---- ISBN-10: 0393264882; ISBN-13: 978-0393264883)\n\nJane Austen, Mansfield Park (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 0199535531; ISBN-13: 978-0199535538)\n\nJane Austen, Persuasion (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 0199535558; ISBN-13: 978-0199535552)\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris.\n\nEnglish 313Studies in 19th Century Fiction: British Children's Fantasy (Post-1830)Botz\n\nMW\n\n11-12:20\n\nEnglish 313 Studies in 19th Century Fiction: British Children's Fantasy (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: It is said that the Victorians invented the idea of childhood: an idyllic state of wonder, play, imagination, and innocence. The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children’s novels befriend animals, outsmart pirates, soar through the London sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers today? This course will explore key works of the Victorian literature canon to consider how these various narratives reflect rapidly transforming conceptions of childhood during the nineteenth century. From Lewis Carroll’s playfully puzzling Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to Rudyard Kipling’s novel of colonial espionage, Kim, Victorian children’s novels offer a unique perspective on a world in the grip of profound political, economic, and religious change. As we read, we will also reflect on the categories of the human and the animal, the nature of child sexuality, the distinctions drawn between innocence and maturity, as well as differences in gender, race, class, and disability. How does the constructed representation of “the child” speak to the desires, ambitions, and anxieties of a given historical moment? And what does the very category of children’s literature suggest about literature’s purpose and value?\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Class presentation, short writing exercises building to final paper/project .\n\nTexts Include: Charles Kingsley, The Water-Babies (1863); Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glass (1865/1871); George MacDonald, At the Back of the North Wind (1871); Robert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island (1883); Rudyard Kipling, Kim (1901); Edith Nesbit, The Story of the Amulet (1906); J.

Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience. Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales: How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife? We will be reading Chaucer's poem in the original Middle English. At the end of the quarter, we will give an in-class performance of one of the tales.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion and some lectures.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): class attendance and participation required; an oral presentation; several short papers; quizzes and a midterm exam.\n\nTexts include: The Canterbury Tales, ed. Jill Mann ISBN 978-0140422344 (approximate cost: $23) (The Canterbury Tales, ed. Larry D. Benson or The Riverside Chaucer, ed. Larry D.

This course will have three units. In the first, we will consider court ladies as authors of romance, comparing the fashionable Lais of Marie de France (12th century) with excerpts from the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century). The second unit will focus on travel literature. We’ll read the Itinerary of William of Rubruck (ca. 1250), one of the first Europeans to visit the court of the Great Khan in the Mongol Empire, along with the best-selling Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1360s), an armchair traveler whose open-minded curiosity makes him a model of premodern ethnography. Finally, we will explore the versatile genre of the framed story collection, reading portions of the Thousand and One Nights, Boccaccio’s Decameron, and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.\n\nTeaching method: Discussion, some lectures.\n\nEvaluation method: Class discussion, three papers; one may be a creative project.\n\nEnglish 324Studies in Medieval Literature: Pagan and Christian in Medieval Literature (Pre-1830/ICSP)Newman\n\nMWF\n\n11-11:50\n\nEnglish 324 Studies in Medieval Literature: Pagan and Christian in Medieval Literature (Pre-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: Medieval culture was overwhelmingly Christian, but it was heir to several pre-Christian religions. Germanic paganism brought monsters, defiant heroism, and expectation of a coming “twilight of the gods,” while Celtic paganism supplied fairy temptresses, magical objects, and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources in vernacular literature. But it’s fascinating to see how medieval writers adapted and transformed the narrative materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present an overtly Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. We will read a selection of Old English, Middle English, and Old French works in translation, concentrating on Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and legends of the Holy Grail.
