Meg's boyfriend Michael, in addition to being a professor of drama at Caerphilly College, is Mefisto the Sorcerer in this series. As such, they are both at the convention.\n\nMichael is there as the character and Meg is sharing a table in the hucksters' room selling swords, knives, etc. (she is a blacksmith). As to be expectedsomeonehere Porfiria a.k.a. Tamerlaine, Wynncliffe-Jones is murdered. As you might expect, a con is not the best venue for the police to solve a murder especially as all the principals of the show have motives for doing away with her. Meg and her family do come up with the actual murderer after suspecting everyone else. It's clear this author either attends or has had some good sources of information about fandom and conventions.\n\nSt. Martin's Press February 2004\n\nSt. Martin's Press/Minotaur 0-312-99675-6 February 2005\n\nAsimov, Janet, Murder at the Galactic Writers' Society\n\nNot strictly an stfnal recursive story. One of the major characters is the writer Fortizak who is clearly modeled upon Isaac Asimov to his continual writing, unwillingness to travel, fondness for food and nubile young ladies whether organic or robotic. The writersof six specieswrite just about anything but science fiction. The book is set in \"Isaac's Universe\" and the title is modeled after Isaac Asimov's mystery Murder at the ABA.\n\nDAW 0-88677-644-9 (No. 972), January 1995\n\nBenford, Gregory, Timescape\n\nMore a crossover than a recursive story. One of the characters is David Selig the protagonist of Dying Inside by Robert Silverberg (chapter 27).\n\nSimon & Schuster 25327-1, July 1980\n\nPocket Books 83389-8, July 1981; 45585-0, 1983; 50632-3, May 1987\n\nBetancourt, John Gregory, \"The Merry Men of Riverworld\"\n\nJules Verne appears as a character in this story, but in the role of a leader of society rather than as an author.\n\nTales of Riverworld (ed. by Phiilp José Farmer) Questar 0-446-36269-7, August 1992 (pp237-282)\n\nBishop, Michael, \"On the Street of The Serpents\"\n\nThe story is subtitled \"or, The Assassination of Chairman Mao, as Effected by the Author in Seville, Spain, in the Spring of 1992, a Year of No Certain Historicity.\" Michael Bishop is both the author of this story and its major character. However, nowhere is the story is he truly identified as an SF writer and that identity, even if established, has nothing to do with the story, per se.\n\nScience Fiction Emphasis #1 (ed. by David Gerrold), Ballantine 23962-8, May 1974 (pp.141-211)\n\nBlish, James, The Frozen Year\n\nA good science fiction story about the Second Western Polar Basin Expedition during the International Geophysical Year (July 1957 to December 1958). The only problem is that the protagonist, Julian Cole, is a science writernot a science fiction writer.\n\nBallantine 197, 1957\n\nBloch, Robert, \"The Creative Urge\"\n\nTwo characters in a manuscript discuss their concepts of the Authorwhther He is Good or Evil and if they can ever know Him. This discussion comes to an end as the Devil, the Author of this story, decides to shred it and start on another one.\n\nWeird Tales 53:1, Fall 1991 (pp.100-102)\n\nBloch, Robert, \"Hell on Earth\"\n\nDetective Guy Roberts is hired by Professor Phillips Keith of the Rocklynn Institute to be a skeptical eyewitness and historian. The professor and Lily Ross are involved in a scientific study of sorcery and black magic. Instead of a demon, they invoke the devil who possesses them one by one. Roberts, author of Hell Hath No Fury and The Sign of the Bull (among others) realizes the power of the word and the damage that his writings have done. This was adapted to a graphic novel in 1985 by DC Publications The protagonist's occupation was changed to horror writer. Substantial changes were made to the story's ending.\n\nWeird Tales March 1942\n\nSummons from the Tomb, (edited by Peter A. Haining), Brown Watson R968, 1966\n\nBretnor, Reginald, \"Rokuro-Kubi\"\n\nA story of a Japanese vampire told in The Bilge Pump, a bar in a sunken ship H.M.S. Dryad in San Francisco. The regular patrons are supposed to be science fiction writers, but none makes an appearance.\n\nWorlds of Fantasy & Horror 1:1 Summer 1994 (pp.77-82)\n\nBrown, Fredric, The Lights in the Sky Are Stars\n\nThe story of the first manned Jupiter rocket and how the funding progressed through government channels. At one point the main character, Max Andrews, mentioned that, while in his teens, he had read an SF book called Mad Universe, or something like thatpossibly What Mad Universe by Frederic Brown.\n\nE. P. Dutton & Co., 1953\n\nBrunner, John, The Long Result\n\nOne of the major characters, Micky Torres, has written a book, Stars Beckoned, about the early days of the colonization of Venus. However, in the context of this story, it is an historical romance. One of the book's readers found a pile of his grandfather's SF books and magazines in the attic and sent it to Torres.\n\nFaber & Faber, 1965\n\nBallantine U2329, September 1966\n\nCollins, Max Allen, The Pearl Harbor Murders Mystery\n\nThis is a straight-forward mystery story in which Edgar Rice Burroughs in the protagonist.\n\nBerkley 0-425-17943-6, May 2001\n\nCollins, Randall, The Case of the Philosopher's Ring Mystery\n\nThere are a number of books in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appears as a character. However, these are mainly detective stories where his characteristics as a Spiritualist or his role as Watson's literary agent is used rather than his actions as an SF writer. This book is an example that treats of both.\n\nCrown 53530-0, 1978 [De Waal Sherlockiana catalogue entry 4879b]\n\nCrispin, A. C., The Eyes of the Beholders\n\nIn this subplot of the 13th novel of Star Trek The Next Generation Lt. Commander Data is trying to write a romantic novel of the first star ship. His crewmates do not want to tell him his writing is atrocious and suggest he rewrite as Ernest Hemingway or Jane Austen. Finally, Counselor Troi advises him to write about what he knows rather than attempt stories about human emotion. He abandons the project after coming across a copy of Isaac Asimov's I, Robot. From Data's viewpoint, he is trying to write historical fiction  not science fiction.\n\nPocket Books 70010-3, September 1990\n\nCrumb, Robert, \"The Religious Experience of Philip K. Dick\" Graphics\n\nNot strictly recursive. A biographical excerpt from Dick's life based upon interviews. Most dialogue taken from Philip K. Dick: The Last Testament by Gregg Rickman, Fragments West/The Valentine Press, 1985. An excellent rendition.\n\nWeirdo17, Summer, 1986, Last Gasp Eco-Funnies (8pp.)\n\nD'Ammassa, Don, \"Shadow Over R'lyeh\"\n\nA mirror-invert of a Lovecraft story. There are supernatural entities such as Blokk and Klarkashton and evenshudderLuvkraft. These are all in the Animacon, one of the unholy books of the Arkhamites. Fun, but more tuckerization than recursion.\n\nPulphouse: A Weekly Magazine 1:3 July 27, 1991 (pp.28-29)\n\nDavies, Stacey, \"Wordsearch\"\n\nA woman is trapped in a manuscript. She gradually works her way back into the word processor and back to the title when she is taken up into the pen.\n\nPulphouse 6 Winter [March] 1990 (pp.25-28)\n\nDerleth, August (editor), Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos\n\nA number of the stories here are truly recursive and they will be found in the main part of this bibliography. Some are marginal dealing with antiquarians or writers of the occult. The works of H. P. Lovecraft are mentioned in several of the stories but on a similar level as the Necronomicon and other great works of the unseen world.\n\nArkham House, 1969\n\nDixon, Franklin W. [house name], Trouble in Warp Space\n\nThis is #172 of the Hardy Boys series. Joe Hardy's girl friend Iola wins a contest and gets a walk-on part in the science fiction television series Warp Space. Her brother Chet gets to play the role of The Slayer form Sirius. However, someone does not want the show to continue and a number of \"accidents\" occur on the set. Yes, the Hardy Boys solve the mystery. Interesting detective story, but not science fiction.\n\nAladdin Paperbacks, Simon & Schuster, 0-7434-3754-3, March 2002\n\nEffinger, George Alec, The Zork Chronicles\n\nThe main part of this book is an adventure set in the Great Underground Empire of Infocom's Zork® game. There are few overtly recursive references here. The framing material are two awards banquets of the Supernatural and Fantastic Wayfarers Association (SFWA = Science Fiction Writers of America) who annually present the Joseph Campbell (equivalent to the Nebula) award to a member. It is a nice touch to have two of the many new muses be Phretys the Muse of Modern Science Fiction and her sister Threnia the Muse of Modern Fantasy Novels. In their resemblance to the Nebula Awards banquet, but lack of any stfnal references, the frame partakes more of a roman a clef than a recursive story. Sandor Courane is mentioned briefly in the final frame.\n\nAvon 75388-X, July 1990\n\nFarmer, Philip José, Dayworld Rebel\n\nOne of the minor characters is named Ibrahim Omar Izimoff who runs a candy and legal drug store. This is probably based upon SF writer Isaac Asimov whose father, Judah, ran a drug store in New York. The character is described as being pudgy with bushy (and purple-dyed) sideburns. Asimov also sports bushy sideburns. The use of the z rather than the s is a long-time annoyance of Isaac Asimov. This is more an in-group joke than a recursion.\n\nAce/Putnam 13230-9, June 1987\n\nAce 14002-5, January 1988\n\nFord, Jeffrey, \"The Empire of Ice Cream\"\n\nOne plot strand involves several characters reading William Jon Watkins' (real) novel The Centrifugal Rickshaw Dancer, but it's a minor strand and there's nothing else recursive (in our terms) in the story. [summary by Dennis Lien]\n\nSciFiction (on-line, edited by Ellen Datlow) 26 February 2003\n\nThe Empire of Ice Cream, Golden Gryphon 1-93084-639-8, April 2006\n\nGardener, Wanless, \"Auto-Fiction, Ltd.\"\n\nTwo entrepreneurs decide there is profit to be made in mechanizing the production of fiction: a properly programmed computer (punch card sorter, during the start-up) can produce stories more rapidly than human authors, and because they can undercut on price those human authors are soon driven out of the market. While we are told the machine can and does write all sorts of fiction, there is no specific mention of it doing sf/f, so the story isn't really recursive. At the end, there's a metafictional moment when it is strongly implied that Gardner's story has itself been machine-written. [Dennis Lien]\n\nScience Fantasy [British] 4:12 February 1955 (pp.63-83)\n\nGorman, Ed, \"Fool's Paradise\"\n\nEdgar Allen Poe appears as a character in this story, but it does not deal with writing and the viewpoint character is Dashiell Hammett\n\nTales of Riverworld (ed. by Phiilp José Farmer) Questar 0-446-36269-7, August 1992 (pp207-236)\n\nHeinlein, Robert A., The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\n\nThe major character in the book is a writer (and articulates this well) but he is not particularly a science fiction writer and this craft is peripheral to the novel.\n\nPutnam, November 1985\n\nKandel, Michael, In Between Dragons\n\nAll the books in McGulvey's library allow Sherman Potts to enter a set of worlds. Some are science fictional, some fantasy, some spy adventure. Problems arise when Sherman introduces a pornographic book into the library.\n\nBantam 28814-8, September 1990\n\nKirkwood, James (pseudonym of Charles Sheffield), \"The Invasion of Space\"\n\nA group of scientist and science writers get together to rerestablish a space program. None of them are science fiction writers; the only reference to SF is that there is a poet who wrote his doctoral dissetation on the works of J. G. Ballard.\n\nHow to Save the World (ed. by Charles Sheffield ), Tor 0-312-85577-X, September 1995 (pp109-137)\n\nKurland, Michael & Barton, S. W., The Last President Adventure\n\nAn attempt by the President of the United States to subvert the Constitution in order to remain in office. The only blatant SF element is a news bureau report on the 1973 World Science Fiction Convention (Torcon 2, Toronto, Ontario); this report is interrupted by a bulletin about appointments of a new ambassador to Iran and a new head of the C.I.A.\n\nBernard Geis Associates, 1980 (pp.100-101)\n\nKurland, Michael, The Whenabouts of Burr\n\nThe replacement of the original copy of the Constitution by one signed by Aaron Burr leads to adventures amongst the branching timelines. Dr. Dunstan Dutton, Director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures believes in the Great Cypher. Specifically, he believes that Isaac Asimov wrote King Lear and that Avram Davidson wrote the Pentateuch. Reasonable as these conclusions are, they have nothing to do with the story.\n\nDAW UY1182 (no. 157), July 1975 (p.33)\n\nKuttner, Henry, \"Chameleon Man\"\n\nTim Vanderhof is a meek man who suddenly acquires the powers of a human chameleon: he can instantly physically imitate anyone he's with. At first the power is automatic (and embarrassing, as when he finds himself a mixture of circus giant and circus midget in one body), but he later learns to control it, get revenge on his overbearing boss, and all the usual light fantasy stuff. The only recursive moment is one paragraph in which he relates his new powers to \"stories he had read by such authors as H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Henry Kuttner.\" [info from John Boston and Dennis Lien]\n\nWeird Tales 36:2 November 1941 (pp.83-99)\n\nLamont, Duncan pseudonym of Tubb, E. C.\n\nLeiber, Fritz, The Wanderer\n\nAn alien planet pops out of hyperspace, causing havoc upon earth by its gravity. No real recursion here. Some of the characters have read SF and mention it when analyzing the situation.\n\nBallantine, February 1964\n\nLewis, Sinclair, It Can't Happen Here Mainstream\n\nAn early example of political \"what if\" fiction. President Windrip, who becomes a dictator, names Upton Sinclair to be Ambassador to the Court of St. James as a form of exile. Sinclair is not presented favorably. Other authors are mentioned as being persecuted or in opposition to the dictatorship. The works of H. G. Wells have been banned but more as a consequence of British politics than content.\n\nDoubleday, Doran & Company, 1935\n\nMalzberg, Barry N., \"The Several Murders of Roger Ackroyd\"\n\nRoger Ackroyd wants to be a mysterist but has been turned down by the Bank. He refuses to accept this (or suggestions that he attempt to become a westernist, a gothica, a sexualist, or even a (shudder) science-fictionist. He makes use of a friend to put his tapes in the memory banks. However, these seem to be incomplete Agatha Christie mysteries and the solar system is clamoring for the endings.\n\nIsaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, 1:4 Winter 1977 (pp.77-82)\n\nDark Sins, Dark Dreams: Crime in Science Fiction, (ed. by Barry N.

He must perform certain sexual acts in the next 24 hours or Earth will be destroyed. He believes he has tricked the alien but realized that his actions may be just what the alien wanted. Aside from the mention of reading an SF magazine, there is no scientifictional element in the story.\n\nAmazing Science Fiction 47:6 April 1974 (pp. 100-102)\n\nMiesel, Sandra, Dreamrider\n\nVictoria Legarde's mind powers are activated by two shamans (one human, one otter) on an alternate time line. As part of her training she mind visits a number of time branches. In one, she is at the shuttle launch taking the Mars astronauts up to their ship. There is a group of elderly people nearby watching who are science fiction professionals and fans. The artist (with a cowlick) is Frank Kelly Freas; he is sketching Sandra Miesel. The three singers are Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson and Jerry E. Pournelle. The photographer is Ctein. However, they are not identified by name.\n\nAce 156679-7, July 1982 (pp.12-16)\n\nBaen 69844-3, October 1989 [expanded version retitled Shaman ]\n\nMiller, Chris, \"On the Night Before The Last Day They Filmed 'Star Trek'\"\n\nThis is a Star Trek parody with sexual connotations. It ends with Gene Roddenberry waking upbehold it was a dream.\n\nNational Lampoon 1:27 June 1972 (pp61,70)\n\nMoran, Daniel Keys, The Long Run\n\nMore in the category of tuckerization than recursion. At one point Trent leaves Earth on the spaceship The Captain Sir Dominic Flandry (p.136). At another point (p.233) it is revealed that the Flight Caverns under Luna City have a plaque mentioning Robert A. Heinlein who described them in his story \"The Menace From Earth\" (Fantasy & Science Fiction August 1957; New Worlds October 1957).\n\nBantam Spectra 28144-5, September 1989\n\nNelson, David Erik co-author with Spinder, Cara\n\nNewman, Kim, Anno Dracula\n\nIt is a London where Count Dracula married Queen Victoria in 1888. This is not so much recursive as a crossover story where characters from Bram Stoker's Dracula appear and some work for Mycroft Holmes through the Diogenes Club.\n\nSimon & Schuster UK 0671-71780-4 October1992\n\nNewman, Kim, The Bloody Red Baron\n\nA sequel to Anno Dracula. A version of World War I is going on with the Central Powers under the control of Graf von Dracula. Experiments are being performed on the members of Jagdgeschwader Eins at the Château du Malinbois. The vampire Edgar Poe (he dropped his middle name) who gained momentary fame for his futuristic story The Battle of Saint Petersberg, is conscripted from the Prague ghetto by the German government to ghostwrite the story of Baron Manfred von Richtoffen.

Soon afterwards, she vanished. Now, she has been declared legally dead and the estate wants to commission a sequel. After a number of trials, Jacqueline Kirby is selected to write this. While living in Pine Grove, Kathleen's home town, Jacqueline begins to investigate Kathleen's disappearance. There is quite a bit of selective nastiness about agents and the publishing industry and quite a pleasant amount of attention paid to a large black cat.\n\nWarner Books, 1989\n\nWarner Books 36032-5, October 1990\n\nPlatt, Charles, Free Zone\n\nThis is not recursive, but rather a melange of time-tested SF themes including the noble individuals threatened by a conformist state, dinosaurs, Atlanteans, alien invaders, etc.\n\nAvon 75411-8, January 1989\n\nRennie, Gordon and Phoenix, Woodrow, Sherlock Holmes in the Curious Case of the Vanishing Villain Graphic\n\nSherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by Dr. Jekyll. It seems that Mr. Hyde has escaped from his book. Holmes and Watson follow Hyde into the writings of Edgar Allan Poe. There Holmes confronts him in the pendulum room and Hyde leaps into the pit. Although his end is not certain, it seems that he will wind up in Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Gordon Rennie (story); Woodrow Phoenix (art). Although the characters are aware of their nature, this is more metafictional crossover than recursion.\n\nAtomeka, Tundra Publishing 1993\n\nResnick, Mike, Eros at Nadir\n\nNate Page has been hired to write the history of the Velvet Comet as a Round (a holographic musical)Eros in Orbit. He starts by desiring to write an accurate history but winds up with a bit of pleasant and successful fluff. The Round is a great success and everyone is happy except the Velvet Comet's computer Cupid who thinks that Page has sold his soul for worldly gains. Page knows he will never write Eros at Nadir the book telling the true story of the Velvet Comet.

The young Salahuddin, aged 13, reads Foundation (Isaac Asimov) and The Martian Chronicles (Ray Bradbury) while on an airplane flight. Much later there is a reference to Dr. Who in an adventure with the Mutts. This is The Mutants, a story with the third Doctor (story 63, script NNN, broadcast 8 April to 13 May 1972; written by Bob Baker and Dave Martin).\n\nViking Penguin 82537-9, 1989\n\nSheffield, Charles wrote under pseudonym Kirkwood, James\n\nSilverberg, Robert, \"Our Lady of the Sauropods\"\n\nMore of a subtle in-group joke than a recursion.

The Famous Horror Writer believes his wife turns into a monster; he tells this to his brother, a Clubfooted Janitor whose real main job is CIA Assassin, and the brother decides to solve the problem by killing the wife; Author thinks better of this and he and wife kill the brother instead.

Heinlein's character wrote the message \"Creation took eight days\" on his body with his nails. The story referred to is \"Goldfish Bowl\" which appeared in Astounding Science Fiction 42:1 March 1942 but Sturgeon's character must have read a later reprint since the story in Astounding appeared under Heinlein's pseudonym of Anson MacDonald.\n\nThrilling Wonder Stories 44:1 Summer 1954\n\nTubb, E.
