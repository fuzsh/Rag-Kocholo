        "text": "*skip 2 most recent ‘rections update*\n\nIntroduction\n\nI began this stupid little project for a number of reasons. Namely, I wanted to radicalize my brother into watching the Emmy losing segment “Corrections” with me every Friday. Corrections, of course, is the weekly video where Seth Meyers, of Late Night with Seth Meyers, addresses mistakes and controversies from the week’s shows as pointed out by YouTube commenters (internally referred to as ‘Jackals’). The three to twenty minute, Emmy nominated segment, is a combined product of quarantine, no studio audience, acute psychosis, and fandom(?). First I tried to explain it to him joke by joke. Unfortunately, that method has an adverse effect on comedy. Next, I began compiling a list*, which turned into more of a DIY true crime- Pepe Silvia situation…\n\nOnce I started explaining the importance of multiple feuds and bits, I realized just how much the show has evolved into the best form of itself since the pandemic. I wasn’t the only one who noticed this, Jackals and “professional” critics (also here) alike noted that Seth’s show seemed better suited for dedicated nightly viewers than the types that usually make up the audience.\n\nThink Letterman and Conan versus the individually consumable segments that made up a lot of pop culture content in the late 2010s (Corden’s Carpool Karaoke, Kimmel’s Celebrities Read Mean Tweets, any game on Jimmy Fallon). The common thread here: Viewers don’t need context beyond a general grasp of pop culture and a sense of humor. While frequent viewers of Last Week Tonight might have a deeper reference of local news flops, nothing stops a new viewer from appreciating out of touch anchors trying to integrate a trendy internet term into their banter.** Celebrity-centric segments have the added benefit of said celebrity’s fan base. They are a no commitment entry point…It's not a criticism, it’s just true: I don’t need to be a nightly Kimmel viewer to watch/appreciate Zendaya reading mean tweets. This is, what some may point to, as a flaw of Corrections. The entry point was pretty much a year ago and you could catch up, but it takes more than six hours and (at the time of writing this) 39 ads to complete (the kind that are long but you have to pay attention to in order to skip). And even then, there are moments you’ll miss if you haven’t been along for the ride since before the at-home shows of 2020.\n\nThis brings me to…now: The one year anniversary of Corrections. Not to mention, during the 7th annual Meyers Family Thanksgiving Episode, Meyers shared a video of his two sons announcing the birth of their new baby sister.** He noted that the birth of his daughter, Adelaide, was far less chaotic than the birth of his first two children, Ashe, who was nearly born in an Uber, and Axel, the infamous “Lobby Baby”.\n\nAshe made Seth and his wife, Alexi, parents and Axel provided the name and a great deal of content for Meyers’ 2019 Netflix special. So, I figured I would share this fever-dream of a project (1) in an effort to convince more people (or at least my friends) to tune in so that Late Night/Corrections gets the appreciation I think it deserves. And, (2) so that new born Adelaide doesn’t get the shaft, favorite child wise, seeing as she didn’t get a special named after her.\n\nHere it goes: My tribute to one year of Jackals, a baby shower gift to the Meyers Fam, and a monument to my unemployment.***\n\n*As I edited this introduction, I realized typing out explanations also takes the piss out of jokes. But you know what? I don’t care. At this point I’ve sunk 13 hours into writing. So, in the grand tradition of 30 Rock (and people who invest a lot in a hobby only to realize they don’t like it), “I have to climb down, into the darkness”.\n\n**This comment is specific to segments that are individually consumable—not necessarily split from the show (like Corrections)—but their own thing. Plenty of late-night hosts have recurring bits, and Oliver’s, in particular, tend towards deeply satisfying end-of-season pay off.\n\n***AUTHOR’S NOTE:\n\nI know I should post this behemoth of a project in multiple sections (for SEO or readability or mORe CONteNt) or make a video essay like the PLL guy (a combined SIX HOURS of explanation) but I was loosely inspired by the Am I A Lesbian_Masterdoc.pdf, and like the idea of being able to Command F your way through three years of late night television.\n\nUnfortunately, I used Microsoft for my draft…spending a sickening amount of time creating an ~easy 2 navigate~ Table of Contents, Index, Appendix, AND 40+ internal reference links (and a chart/graph visual situation). Imagine my surprise when people weren’t interested in my PDF that was too big to send via Gmail…and, my terror when I had to reformat 61 pages of nonsense AND make a blog (who am I? a frkn golden retriever?!). SO, I’m going to post the bulk of my work here (even though the substack algorithm assigned it a revolting 93 minutes). And I will create other posts for Anatomy of A Desk, The Unofficial LNSM Impression Count (footnotes), and my timeline-of-a-bit model. I’m including a brief (non-linked) Table of Contents below because…why not. I did my best to remove my ~carefully curated~ internal links, but if a link reads “applewebdata” just know it was supposed to take you to an explanation. If I haven’t already apologized, I’m sorry for this project and any promotion I do for it…just know it hurts my pride way more than your feed.\n\n6/27 UPDATE: Substack allows writers to link directly to headings now…which is better than nothing I guess?!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Meyers Cinematic Universe (MCU)\n\nPre-Pandemic\n\nThe Attic Era: Attic Attack (Phase 1)\n\nThe SCCU aka Dawn of the Sea Captain (Phase 2)\n\nThe Crew Era (Phase 3)\n\nThe Crew Era 2: Wally’s World (Phase 4)\n\nOther Multi-Episode Pandemic Bit That Would Flop for An Audience But Weren’t Part of the 200 ‘A Closer Look’-s I Watched to Outline the Show\n\nCorrections Era (Phase 5)\n\nCont.

Weird. But if you’re going to watch, watch like a pro. Consider this your artisan-hand crafted guide (ew) to watching and understanding Late Night With Seth Meyers, the (I have no idea how Nielsen scores work but he usually has more viewers than Corden) ranked late night show.\n\nMaybe you have a thing for under dogs. Always the Emmy nominee, never the Emmy winner. Maybe you’ve caught on that at least 15% of every show is directed towards a small, anonymous, group of insiders and you want to be a part of the 1%. Maybe you are an unemployed recent-graduate, live with your parents, and crave some normalcy…A schedule. STRUCTURE…and use late night TV as a way to keep the days from blending together. Maybe you just like to be negged (we don’t kink shame here)! Maybe, you are lukewarm about joining a cult, have self-diagnosed daddy-issues, or need a way to filter out energy that could potentially get you emotionally and financially trapped in a pseudo-religious pyramid scheme. Well…Seth is the long haired, plaid-clad, silver-ing fox of a late-night host you’ve been looking for. The initiation fee? Years of loyal pandemic and pre-pandemic viewership, or, reading this far too detailed account of the inside jokes that make LNSM feel like the tight knit (maybe toxic?) improv team you always secretly wanted to audition for but never actually joined.\n\nCheck out Wikipedia or any number of interviews (probably) for an actual background on Meyers. The basics? Northwestern, improv, Cast Member, Head Writer and Weekend Update Host (holding the third longest tenure behind Colin Jost and Michael Che) at SNL, Host of Late Night with Seth Meyers (since 2014).\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with his comedic style and are willing to do some digging for the perfect capsule of Meyers’ humor, you have three options to view what is, in my unemployed opinion, a spiritual prequel to many beloved LNSM bits…I present to you (a guide to finding and viewing) J’accuzzi.\n\nGo to peacocktv.com, probably make an account or log in, search SNL, scroll down to Season 34, scroll down again to Episode 10 (John Malkovich), skip to the last quarter of the show. If you wind up at Goodnights you’ve gone too far. If you find yourself watching the infamous Digital Short “Jizz in My Pants” featuring a very 2008 Andy Samberg, you haven’t gone far enough.\n\nJust follow this link (time code 46:24 to be exact).\n\nFor the technologically challenged or those who refuse to make another account, consider the opening line of the sketch: “John Malkovich, one of greatest actors of stage and screen, is returning to Broadway to reprise one his most famous roles—Vicount SéBastien De Valmont—from the 1988 film Dangerous Liaisons. Except this time, all of the seduction, lust, and deception takes place in a hot tub. Don’t miss John Malkovich in J’accuzzi.\n\nI began watching Late Night with Seth Meyers routinely around 2017 thanks to segments like “A Closer Look” and the rare (but much loved) “Second Chance Theater”. However, my favorite part of the show, and the reason I became a regular viewer (as opposed to watching the show later via YouTube clips), is the way he features his writers. Many have recurring segments highlighting their own comedic voices or are featured in one-off sketches, lending an early Conan-energy to the show that was missing elsewhere on the network-late-night line-up.\n\nAmber Ruffin is a head-writer at LNSM while hosting her own bizarre/lovely/smart critically acclaimed comic-variety show, The Amber Ruffin Show, from the same studio (airing Fridays on Peacock). You might remember John Lutz from Mapleworth Murders or his iconic run as an eponymous writer at 30 Rock’s “The Girly Show with Tracy Jordan”. Early seasons of LNSM even featured sketches based out of the writers’ room…Pre-pandemic, the writers, as a unit, I assume, had an annual segment called “Popsicle Schtick”. The segment begins as a defense of proposed monologue jokes, deemed “stinkers”, that the writers claimed could be saved by adding “some kick ass graphics”. The segment devolves into different, anti-Meyers, animated sequences, starring anthropomorphized Popsicle sticks. My favorite…which has curiously been removed from YouTube (a pro-Meyers media outlet)…tells the harrowing story of popsicle stick revolutionaries uniting to overthrow the evil (anti-Schtick, pro-A Closer Look) Meyers. There are, of course, traces of “Popsicle Schtick” in the current“Surprise Inspection” and any number of other writer’s bits, namely this gem from 2021.\n\nCurrent and former writers include Michelle Wolf, who followed in Meyers’ footsteps, hosting the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner, John Lutz, Amber Ruffin of her own damn show, Alex Baze, Sal Gentile (Mets fan), Jenny Hagel, Mike Scollins, and one of my favorite Twitter users, Karen Chee. The show clearly cares for its staff while helping them grow in their own right. The voices that make up the show became uniquely apparent (~in my stoopid unemployed opinion~) during the pandemic as Meyers began referencing who submitted what monologue jokes and airing homemade sketches. (TW: Earnest) Yes, it was great to see Seth in his attic every night…but it was almost better knowing that the people who dedicated themselves to the show were out there clacking away at things they loved rather than bits that played to the studio audience. The same sentiment, of course, later came to include the crew—Seth’s, Jets loving, surrogate audience for over a year.\n\nSome Pre-Pandemic Bits (for background)\n\nFrisbee v Andy Feud\n\nAndy Samberg and Meyers seem to have been dear friends since long before the standing monologue days, when Samberg joined the SNL cast in 2005. Although we cannot confirm when their relationship developed beyond professional, as of 2022, SNL’s former bad-boy and father figure duo* continue to support each other comedically and emotionally from opposite coasts. Throughout LNSM history, Andy has occupied something of an Amy Sedaris on Letterman role: a real mix between promotion and general chaos/comedy. (I highly suggest utilizing the Command+F feature to surf through the many “Andy” appearances.)\n\nOn to the good stuff: The Meyers fam has an Italian Greyhound named Frisbee. Andy Samberg hates Frisbee, telling Seth’s wife, Alexi, “[He] had seen rocks that were cuter”. I assume his hatred extends to all Italian Greyhounds, but I do not speak on behalf of Mr. Samberg. He often slips in jabs about his disdain for the dog, including mailing the Meyers Family holiday card (featuring Frisbee) back. The feud is so niche-community-famous it has at least two fan-cams dedicated to documenting the best moments of the rivalry (see here and HERE PART 2). It should be noted that these videos are slightly validating as this essay(?) is largely based on official LNSM clips that have far less views than the combined 130k garnered by “Andy Samberg hating Frisbee for 4 minutes and 40 seconds straight” Parts 1 and 2.\n\nMike Shoemaker\n\nWe know very little about Mikey the Shoe. As executive producer he seems to sit and criticize (?) a lot. In this political environment you’d think that a man referenced a couple times a week on a late night network show would have at least a Wikipedia page. You’d be wrong. There is a Mike Shoemaker Wikipedia entry for a former Ohio State Representative/Senator. He is a Democrat who opposed school vouchers and created the Department of Aging…irrefutable evidence that democracy’s Shoemaker and the entertainment industry’s Shoemaker are separate individuals and not a pseudo-Hannah Montana situation. Learn about his fabulous career as a producer on entertainment Wikipedia (IMDb), through his NBC Bio, or—as I did—through various off-camera remarks (with varying degrees of malice/tenderness).\n\nFor an update on how Mikey the Shoe is doing :)\n\nWally Feresten\n\nWally aka Cue Card Wally aka Wally the Cue, unlike the aforementioned off-camera super-stud, has his own Wikipedia page! Also unlike Mikey the Shoe, Wally has really stepped into his role as an LNSM on-camera favorite since returning to the studio, even garnering the attention of Emmy-winning late night host, John Oliver. The details of Wally’s rise to fame below… Pre-pandemic however, audiences knew Wally as 30 Rock’s trusted source for all things cue. Since 1990, SNL, and other 30 Rock-based entertainment, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, LNSM, and The Amber Ruffin Show, have been, and continue to be, performed at the mercy of Cue Card Wally. SNL writer Streeter Seidell notes, “Wally’s referenced a lot…[for] a none camera person, he gets a lot of love.”. Pre-pandemic however, in the Meyers Cinematic Universe, neither Wally nor the crew had anywhere near the screen time they enjoy now …likely because their appearances threatened the ego of the guy who has a show featuring his first and last name as 40% of the title.\n\n*Unfortunately, Meyers and Samberg have since been replaced—and some say outshined—by current SNL bad-boy and father figure, Pete Davidson and Colin Jost, thanks to their relationships with women far more rich and famous.\n\nPopular Writers’ Segments\n\nThis section was originally formatted in a beautiful little chart. Unfortunately, it looked b-a-d on Substack and really ruined the flow of the essay. Now, it is safely housed in footnotes with the other misfit toys / “un-formatables”. *\n\n*All based on the official Late Night with Seth Meyers YouTube Channel playlist titled, “Seth’s Writers on Meyers”, and nothing else because the LNSM YouTube is really lacking in the archival segment footage department (aka Popsicle Schtick ERASURE) (aka @LNSM hire me please, I’ll make really niche TikTok content or something so I don’t step on anybody’s toes)\n\nThe Attic Era: Attic Attack (Phase 1)\n\nMarch 12, 2020: the last show in studio. Everything is uncertain and scary. Honestly, I don’t even like thinking about those early couple of weeks. So I’m not going to…but here are the basics:\n\nLNSM films from the Meyers family home. We see a couple of test backgrounds including bookshelves in a garage and a living room corner space (?) before landing on the titular location of Phase 1…The Attic. April 15th marks the beginning of Meyers’ long hair era (seen here debuting the segment “Who I Miss” in honor of his longtime stylist Bettie Rogers).\n\nHighlights:\n\nWelcome to the attic crawl space and the glorious era of doing jokes that would not land in front of an audience.\n\nWhat’s up with that little freaky door?\n\nThere is a portal in Seth’s attic/studio that allows his famous friends to visit him (?).\n\nWhatsupwithsethstinydoor@gmail.com\n\nLNSM deals with wasps in the attic where Seth films episodes. At some point or another, the wasp problem is dealt with but Seth admits to going a little crazy and makes his sons wasp costumes.\n\nSeth addresses a copy (and changing numbers of copies) of The Thorn Birds, a 1977 Australian romance novel on his side table. Was he sending secret messages? Or did it just mark the beginning of him reading too many YouTube comments?\n\nwhydidsethpickthethornbirds@gmail.com\n\nVarious series of books keep appearing/disappearing\n\nSegways get less artful\n\nAttic Stockholm Syndrome sets it.\n\n06/12/2020: 1000 Episodes of Late Night\n\n06/25/2020: Seth steps through his tiny door portal…thus ending the Attack Era\n\nThe SCCU (Phase 2 aka Dawn of the Sea Captain)\n\nJuly 13, 2020: The day fans realized we were NOT the center of this story. In fact, were never in the MCU at all, we were extras in the SCCU (Sea Captain Cinematic Universe). At his in-laws’ house, Seth entered a new era of not playing to a crowd, giving complete creative control to a talking portrait of a sea captain. Buckle up…or should I say batten down the hatches, future Jackals. It’s about to get…really nautical.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe Thorn Birds is back, wasps are not. Unfortunately, there is a ghost of an old sea captain haunting Seth’s new studio space, soon dubbed “The Captain’s Quarters”.\n\nThe ghost of the old sea captain takes tentative control of his portrait and can now move his mouth.\n\nBad segways also make it through the portal.\n\nSeth and the Sea Captain begin conversing, marking a change in their relationship.\n\nLong Hair Seth: Day 136\n\nA Remarkable day in SCCU history: The dawning of Dawson’s Creek discourse\n\nAlexi is a “Creek Freak”\n\nSea Captain is team Pacey\n\nSeth DTRs, calling the Sea Captain his friend for the first time.\n\nIntroduces the idea of Sea Captain Polls\n\nSeth explains BTS production of The Thorn Birds, kind of putting an end to the bit.\n\n8/3/2020: Sea Captain B Plot Twitter Poll Posted. Nearly 6,000 pre-Jackals vote.\n\nGhost Lobster wins with 43.6%. Followed by Estranged Children (33.8%), Fisherman Best Friend (18.4%), and the remaining—made up of largely single issue, anti-SCCU voters—opted for Other (4.3%).\n\nDespite failing to obtain a plurality, “Other” is featured as a talking head…He is a “Brooklyn type duck” named Ira who lives in Prospect Park. Critics of the character argue this was a strategic, albeit transparent, move to position the Sea Captain and Ghost Lobster as more sophisticated bits. Pro-SCCU bias at LNSM becomes clear.\n\nThe Sea Captain evolves, demonstrating an understanding of the fourth wall…Probably from watching Seth film, but it is possible he finally got around to watching Fleabag.\n\nSeth announces that there will only be eight more shows in the Captains Quarters.\n\nIra, the Prospect Park duck, returns in @seacaptainpolls twitter poll, asking, despite previous election results, if there should be “more duck,” “less duck,” or “Other”. “More duck” wins with 61.1%. Although, it should be noted that turn-out was down in every key demographic—reflected in the vote totals: 701 (as compared to the previous 5,921).\n\nIn yet another example of pro-SCCU bias via LNSM, viewers are introduced to the “other” option post-election. This time it is a childhood portrait of Alexi from a street-artist. By all accounts, the portrait retains similar Sea Captain powers.\n\nGhost Lobster seems to have disappeared. Friends and family report that no one has directly spoken with him since TV appearances following his initial victory.\n\nAnti-SCCU activist, Larry Meyers, confronts the charismatic portrait.\n\nMeyers (Larry) criticizes the Sea Captain for heavily relying on puns, failing to engage in topical, issue-based humor, and for sounding like Will Forte. Meyers admits to a Hader bias, sometimes even leaning Sudeikis.\n\nAnti-SCCUers agree, talks unsuccessful because the Sea Captain seems incapable of accepting push-back, thanks to surrounding himself with yes-men.\n\nThe SCCU expands again, this time sans-vote, introducing Steve, the fish that probably has a drug problem. Foreshadowing events in this timeline, democracy appears to be dead in the SCCU.\n\nThe SCCU regime, headed by the titular Sea Captain, extends an olive branch in the form of a pseudo-referendum vote of confidence. Pro-SCCUers remember to turn out this time and secure an unprecedented 80.2% of the vote. A few third-party analysts have voiced concern over the wording of ballot measures. However, the day is celebrated as not only a win for the SCCU, but, with over 9,000 votes, a win for democracy.\n\nCallback alert! Hillary Meyers, wife of radical anti-SCCUer Larry Meyers, appears on the show, voicing her more middle of the road take on the SCCU.\n\nFriends and family of Ghost Lobster are relieved, receiving proof of life footage as many began giving up hope. Seth seems to flex some control over the SCCU, preventing multiple inanimate object from releasing origin stories and cross-over adventures.\n\nQuickly, we are reminded of SCCU editorial supremacy when Seth introduces Vicky, a sexy mermaid (with an unsexy voice), as the cast member that would have been introduced if, hypothetically, the previous poll had an “Other” option and won.\n\nSteve the fish is tricked into getting clean, a method proven highly effective among drug-addicted marine life.\n\nAnti-SCCUers outraged that talking nautical knick-knacks received air-time over a hypothetically more-subtle bit where Seth replaced the titles of Avian-centric literature with Thornbird (example: To Kill A Mockingbird → To Kill A Thorn Bird). Bibliophiles and Murakami fans join anti-SCCU faction. It should be noted: most analysts believe it was not escape from the Captain’s Quarters, but Seth’s long hair, that eventually led to bipartisan escape plans.\n\nOther bits that did not make the cut for the SIXTY-EIGHT at home shows:\n\nTalking portrait of Jon Haam\n\nChecking in with Ethan Hawke as he attempts to exterminate the wasps in Seth’s attic (#callback)\n\nAmy Schumer joins as an in person guest\n\nVicky gets a new (sexy) voice\n\nSteve gets clean\n\nIra starts a podcast\n\nGhost Lobster given the representation originally promised…turns out the vote wasn’t for a place in the SCCU, but a contest…winner gets an agent! He is happy to be a part of the Underwater Talent Agency and already scored a role in the action film B Plot as Sea Captain’s complicated nemesis turned first mate.\n\nSea Captain’s narrative arch presumably ends telling viewers, “I got to participate in a long psychotic bit that would have eaten sh*t in front of a live audience.”.\n\nViewers and long-time pro-SCCUers are treated to a farewell shanty (or so they thought) sung by the trusty captain:\n\nDa moon is full. Da sea is calm. We’re ready to depart. No way to know the ending, when you’re standing at the start. And for all those lads and lasses waving at the pier, let this be the last song that they this night shall listen toooo. Oh goodbye, goodbye. I’ll see you on the other side. For what goes out comes in again, just like the rising tide. When life is tough and the water’s rough, have a good friend at your side.\n\n[Ira] Goodbye. [Seth] **screams**.\n\nGoodbye, I’ll see you on the other side. Oh this past half year has been severe, on that we all agree. But I’ve no doubt we’ll make it out, if I have ya’ here with me. So batten down the hatches boys and pull your masks up tight. I promise there’ll be morning, if we make it through the night.\n\n[Ghost Lobster] Goodbye. [Steve] Goodbye. [Vicky, **unsexy voice**] See you on the other side.\n\nFor what goes out comes in again, just like the rising tide.\n\n[Seth] **blows raspberries**.\n\nIt’s not the road I would’ve chose, but I sure enjoyed the ride. Goodbye, goodbye. I’ll see you on the other side. OHHhhH goodbye. GOODbye. I’ll see you on the other side. **winks** Siyde.\n\n[Seth] Stay safe. [Steve] Wash your hands. [Ira] Wear a mask. [ALL] We love you…\n\nBEAT\n\n[Ashe] Daddy it’s time to go.\n\n[Seth] It’s time to go? But Axel, where does that door lead?\n\n[Axel] (mumbling) I don’t know.\n\n[Seth] That’s all I need to know. Let’s go boys\n\n[Axel] Why?\n\n[Seth] Just, we’re gunna go.\n\n[Ashe] (growing more frustrated) No! Not another time.\n\n[Seth] Don’t give away how many times we’ve done this.\n\nThe Crew Era (Phase 3)\n\nThe Captain’s Quarter disappears into the infinite void of at-home late night quarantine sets. In a multi-versal twist and thanks to sheer commitment to the bit (a dominant trait among many a jackal) the SCCU expands beyond location, enveloping Studio 8G, and, we can assume, our own reality. LNSM does not reckon with this timeline shift until Phase 4. However, in retrospect it is easy to tell because the titular Sea Captain is no longer tied to haunting a physical location or comedic style (puns). Some critics argue Sea Captain is the inspiration for Wanda Maximoff’s character arch.*\n\nSeptember 8, 2020 Seth returns to studio 8G without an audience. Although tensions remain between pro and anti-SCCUers, viewers unite over a shared love of LNSM sans-audience. The crew becomes a stand-in for nightly viewers, chuckling every so often. Jokes remain niche, bits, intricate and pre-established, and most national sports coverage is slashed in favor of Mets, Knicks, and Jets commentary.\n\nThe Crew Era (Phase 3) is marked by several new era specific signifiers. Viewers are delighted by the slow re-introduction of in-person guests, writer’s cameos, off camera chuckles, the age of impressions, and asides to Mike Shoemaker (Mikey the Shoe). Join me on this dive through Late Night history…because if CNN can do an entire docu-series on it, I can…write a convoluted essay explaining bits from well over a year ago (?).\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe Sea Captain begins reading The Thorn Birds. Seth reveals the ghost smelled like clams and admits to being sick of him and his puns. Most viewers (except a group of radical Sea Captain enthusiasts) relieved to find out Seth’s Stockholm Syndrome was broken and deprogramming would not be necessary.\n\nAlthough Seth promises an end to talking inanimate objects, viewers notice two clues that the SCCU has expanded into our reality: (1) Segways remain bad despite returning to the studio. (2) The testament to Seth’s onetime husband Stefon, a Russian nesting doll of his blushing bride—which has been a longtime fixture of the LNSM desk collection—delivered the Segway in question.\n\nSeth delivers a brief Rocky impression, an early sign that the age of impressions is on the horizon. Rocky marks the beginning of this unemployed loser’s unofficial impression count.\n\nReminder: Seth does a decent Trump. Viewers are treated to the early stages of a future fan favorite, Mike Lindell.\n\nSeth plugs his show, The Awesomes, with a talking action figure and laugh track erasures.\n\nAlthough many critics agree the official age of impressions does not begin until four impressions per show, the Sep. 10, 2020 A Closer Look debuts another fan favorite: the Andy Samberg impression. (Impression Count: 3)\n\nViewers are relieved that although Seth returned to studio and would be delivering jokes to a small crew, his references remain obscure, from the 20th century, and largely sci-fi adjacent.\n\nSeth refers to September 2020** as a “John Carpenter Hell Scape…You know, where TheThingEscape[d] from New York, only to move to DC, to become the Prince of Darkness and now there’s Big Trouble in Little…well, everywhere.”\n\nSeth begins…what becomes a roller-coaster relationship with the Graphics Department. Although it is not on display as publicly as in the coming Corrections Era, their love-affair, in this clip, hinges on a sort of joke-graphic-reality equilibrium: the joke and accompanying graphic must represent proper grammar, reality, and anatomically correct animals to avoid the wrath of commenters.\n\nShowcasing another key marker of The Crew Era (Phase 3), Seth makes a Jets/Giants joke. We learn that although the crew is made of Jets fans…the security guards support the Giants.\n\nAfter a joke about how the original Homer Simpson looks like Walter Matthau, Seth reveals that it is none other than “A Closer Look” supervising writer/producer, Sal Gentile, including late-twentieth century pop culture references to underscore political commentary.\n\nSeth says he owed $750 (the same amount Trump paid in taxes in 2017) to Blockbuster thanks to a copy of The Prince of Tides that he lent to his stoner friend that sold it in a yard sale in 1993.\n\nGiuliani impression\n\nAlthough pre-pandemic viewers were sometimes treated to off-camera remarks to Wally/the crew, it becomes a recurring feature during “A Closer Look”, particularly addressing Executive Producer, Mike Shoemaker (as seen here).\n\nLNSM buys a raccoon puppet in solidarity with the journalists dealing with raccoon infestation at the White House (this is done in Primetime btw)\n\nSeth compares volatile hiring/firing practices at Fox to the NY Jets.\n\nAn iconic recurring impression: Trump on the phone with Mel\n\nCompares Mark Meadows pouring over 60 Minutes tapes to the NY Jets defensive coordinator after a blowout: “We forgot to tackle. And what was he holding? What? No. Not a pointy brown egg. A football. Love to not go through this every week.”\n\nRudy Giuliani married his cousin. This is important for most future Giuliani bits.\n\n[Seth] You know what Giuliani’s catchphrase used to be, Shoemaker?\n\n[Mikey the Shoe] No, what was it?\n\n[Seth] **Borat style** MY COUSIN.\n\n(Shoemaker does not like Borat. Seth claims he does like Borat impressions though)\n\nSeth debuts his Paul Giamadi as John Adams impression…a landmark in early impression era impressions. During the same segment, Seth repeats the impression, insinuating Adams would be disappointed given the state of SCOTUS.\n\nMike Scollins, a LNSM writer, wore a tank top in a Zoom meeting. Why? We don’t know. Seth shares this with his audience. Although Scollins stands by the tank top, he did not like the joke.\n\nIn the first show after the election was called for Joe Biden, Seth remarks, “It’s nice to get Quade from The Rookie after four years of Quade from Total Recall. I know in one case it’s the actors name and the other’s the character’s name, but the joke is for Andy Samberg and I’m pretty sure he’s going to like it just fine.\n\nJets diss\n\nAfter reports that there might be a vaccine on the horizon, Seth says that he’s been showing up to his local CVS wearing a tank top, “looking like Late Night writer Mike Scollins.” He confirmed that much like the pandemic, the tank top burn will have multiple waves.\n\nSeth credits Sal Gentile for this specific Scollins burn, noting that Gentile was not even in the original Zoom meeting where Scollins wore the garment. He speaks to Scollins through the camera, “That’s how ridiculous you look Mike…he heard it second hand!”. Gentile wrote the piece save a tangential joke about Thanksgiving in July that Seth added, switching fireworks for “fireturks”. Gentile wanted to stress that “fireturks” was Seth’s NOT his.\n\nSame segment: Seth details his Google search antics to figure out how Trump was defacing democracy in Wayne County, Michigan. He closes remarking, “The point is this stupid coup is taking a long f*cking time!”\n\nLNSM nicknames Trump and Giuliani (and later Mike Lindell) The Kooky Cuckoo Coup Crew\n\nBetween when the deranged reality show host left office and when audiences came back to LNSM, there was a lot of room for callbacks and impressions. During the early days of The Kooky Cuckoo Coup Crew however, this comparison of what five months feels like was especially affective.\n\nIt should be noted that at this point in the recap process, Meyers has performed 24 different impressions. The list will be included in the Appendix. (now footnote 2)\n\nSeth does an impression of Andy Samberg as a kid who wants Trump for their oral report, “I want the guy who knew Grimace!”\n\nIntroducing Seth’s Bane impression! Shoemaker, apparently, won’t help Seth iron out the kinks of Bane…too busy Executive Producing probably.\n\nIt’s the New Year! What will the Late Night hosts do once Trump leaves office?! This question…kind of…made sense on January 4, 2021. The Kooky Cuckoo Coup Crew has new members and is up to their old tricks.\n\nAuthor’s Note: I’m a big fan off Late Night with Seth Meyers. I am a big fan of the tradition of late night television in general. Hosts get stuff wrong a lot. It’s late night television—not hard hitting news. With that in mind, on January 5, 2021, Seth Meyers ate it. And ate it hard: “On Monday night [Jan 4] Trump held, what will very likely be his last rally of President of the United States. And man, it feels good to say that. I feel like Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah’s couch. Do you guys remember that?”.\n\nMore Bane\n\nWerner Herzog film commentary and impression. Keep note of this one. It keeps coming back. Seth also refers to Mike Lindell, but only as the Founder of MyPillow. At this point in 2021, I assume he did not feel a sufficient enough relationship to the character to develop a take on it.\n\nOn Trump’s last day in office, Seth treats viewers to his Jimmy Carter impression (Impression Count: 29). Shrugging off the success of Carter, he jumps into a closing piece on Mike Lindell that doesn’t yet have a real perspective.\n\n*Because, power wise, he went from messing with Seth’s head to shifting reality and such. Some go so far as predicting a Sea Captain cameo in the much anticipated Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness.\n\n**A note from the author during her writing process: It is Dec. 12, 2021 at 6:50 PM. I have officially spent 21 hours working on this project. I am 12 pages and 57/200 “A Closer Look”-s in…and that doesn’t include Twitter, guests, or ACTUAL CORRECTIONS. I just realized I have over a year’s worth of content to cover and I am kind of spiraling. Who will ever read this? I only have 211 followers on Twitter. Even if I tweeted it—I don’t have a website to publish on, except for my ~bad~ portfolio. Can you tweet a PDF?...also I love Keke Palmer but if I see her Old Navy ad one more time I’m going to lose it. (March 21st Update: After a failed attempt at publishing via Google Docs, I am trying my hand at Substack. Also, since December I have apparently lost seven Twitter followers. )\n\nThe Crew Era 2: Wally’s World (Phase 4)\n\nAfter a closed-door meeting with Mad Men style executives (me), what was originally Phase 3, became Phases 3 and 4 (Phase 3: The S4quel). Why? Answer: Dune…For everything to make sense there was simply too much world building…too much to establish for all of LNSM’s carefully created arcs to have the emotional pay off they deserve…for one phase.\n\nProducers (my blood sugar and will to keep writing) decided to engineer the split around the 2021 Inauguration because, although most things stayed really really bad, no one was trying to declare Martial Law anymore. Production is using the sequel to highlight how LNSM navigated the closing weeks of the “Jokes Must Just Write Themselves” conundrum and the “What are You Going to Do After Trump” paradox. It was through their sheer dedication to bits, accent accuracy, and pandering to the crew that LNSM was able to really weed out the weenies and perfect the online engagement ratio of bananas fans (I accidently intimately tied my well-being to this show’s performance, comedic development, and continued success) to casual (people who don’t care if a joke is 100% accurate) viewers. Too many of either spells danger. Not enough, certain death. Luckily for Seth, once you get the international linguistics community on your side—you are really set for life. Our unlikely hero, Cue Card Wally distinguishes himself from the crew, establishing a reputation as a comedian in his own right. He is written into monologues, frequently referenced, and makes a guest appearance. Most importantly, Phase 4 content is introspective, looking back on the bits that started it all...secret doors, Sea Captains, and enough emotional chaos to vomit your crazy into a project—it is more than likely—no one will see.\n\nHighlights\n\nA Closer Look opens with smooth jazz rather than the BABADABADA DUM viewers have come to associate with the segment. No more deranged former Twitter user means more room for Wally content…as the name implies, this is truly Wally’s World.\n\nQueue prop comedy (and dated CSI references): “Well if erection is the charge, we certainly don’t want them to…beat it” **Seth puts on aviators and smiles (to himself) as crew members chuckle** “And they said we would run out of material!”.\n\nIMPORTANT: The first on-air correction. Parisian viewers made note that, yes, Paris has an incline (called funicular). Seth makes note of this then says he would also like to retract calling Ted Cruz a jagoff. But, in the second case, he only retracts so that he can look at the graphic of Ted Cruz and call him a jagoff for the first time, again.\n\nReturn of Seth’s “Questioning Tucker Carlson” impression. AND…A first attempt at a Mike Lindell impression…although this iteration is particularly pointed at the “Founder of MyPillow” side of the mustached former sleep pseudo-scientist, NOT the “carrying a notebook out of the Oval Office that says, ‘Martial Law?’” side, that has come to reign supreme on LNSM.\n\nImpression of Lindsey Graham collecting his boogers.\n\n“If that’s the charge, I hope he doesn’t…get off” **puts sunglasses on** “LOOK GUYSSS, we’re gunna do it every time someone does a Freudian slip. Because the FIRST rule of late night is, when you flips, I quips”…That is not the only Horatio Caine one liner of the segment.\n\n“Oh. My. Pillow.” Thanks to Lindell’s moderate resemblance to fabulously midwestern men of The Super Fans, Seth begins to combine Lindell impressions with the famed catchphrase, “Daaa Bears”.\n\nJets diss\n\nIf Corden can sing in his Range Rover while it is being towed by a truck with literally every celebrity ever, Late Night’s budget should include funds for more music royalties (specifically K-Fed’s 2006 single, Popozao). Maybe if NBC sprung for more than one Popo, Seth, and more importantly, his staff and crew would be Emmy winners.\n\nHarry and the Hendersons reference\n\nTwo early iterations of now divine bits: Mike Lindell impression (leaning more and more midwestern) and, in a reference to the brick-like nature of MyPillow, the first of many cicada related tangents.\n\nIconic moment: Seth wears a flannel with more than just blue on it (I spy something red…and blue).\n\nMad Max Cinematic Universe Tangent: the flaming guitar guy’s name is Doof Warior (?).\n\nSEA CAPTAIN\n\nTrump’s second impeachment lawyers are very very bad. Also very bad…Seth’s first attempt to write a Hamilton spin-off called Franklin.\n\nWerner Herzog impression: German with villainous undertones and hints of existentialism.\n\nAustralian fans have been making a lot of noise about proper pronunciation, deterring Seth from making another Mad Max joke.\n\nMyPillow Guy Impression Evolution Update: The voice of Mike Lindell officially takes on the Midwestern dialect of The Super Fans, usually tying it all together with a topical “DaaBears” pun.\n\nSeth performs a scene from A Street Car Named De-Liar, a la Lindsey Graham. Rumors about longtime anti-SCCU activist, Larry Meyers, confirmed: he still hates the Sea Captain despite recent shifts towards non-SCCU character arcs. Brief Sea Captain cameo includes a message from Andy: “Frisbee sucks.”.\n\nOther Multi-Episode Pandemic Bits That Would Flop for an Audience, But Weren’t Part of the Nearly 200 ‘A Closer Look’-s I Watched To Outline the Show\n\nAlthough many a YouTube commenter takes issue with the facts and figures of “A Closer Look” the true fans—future jackals—aren’t here for the news…I assume most start their day with Michael Barbaro. They donate to NPR and either own a lot of craft supplies or are at least a little into fantasy roll-playing-games (probably D&D or MTG). The true fans are here for the weird stuff. The obscure comparison, the New York based and biased references, the anti-“National Day Of”-riff. As mentioned at the beginning…the true LNSM fan (often Jackal) is too self-aware to join a cult/MLM, but yearns for a sense of community…to be part of something bigger than themselves (and likely, craves more than a little negging from a white guy in some version of a blue shirt). So here is a (not-at-all-conclusive) list of oddities excluded by the previous eras of highlights:\n\nTiny Secret Whispers\n\nTiny Secret Whispers, the prestige TV drama Seth cannot get enough of!!…especially now that the Trump era is over and the “jokes [don’t] just write themselves” anymore. To remain topical, Seth delivers recaps to off-camera entertainment man of mystery, Mikey the Shoe.\n\nFirst mentioned March 10, 2021: TSW is “available to stream” here and bears a striking resemblance to dark prestige-y shows a la HBO’s Sunday night line-up (Mare of Eastown and other sepia toned female-centric mysteries)\n\nStreaming on *international media conglomerate*’s platform, “Butternut”. Butternut specializes in American shows featuring solely non-American actors.\n\nThere are twins involved in a murder, one of them is arrested, and their parents (Packer and Liese) have a fraught relationship…he’s an architect, she used to be a ballerina but now she’s a life coach…he was friends with the case’s lead detective (Detective Delgado) in high school according to a yearbook his wife found, she’s a grade-A investigative actor and frantic bookcase-looker\n\nPacker is played by Australian actor Joel Edgerton (soft g pronunciation), not to be confused with the Australian actor, Joel EdGerton (hard G pronunciation)\n\n“For Your Tiny, Secret Consideration”: Seth, immortalized in Vulture, all but confirms the upcoming TSW Emmy-sweep.\n\nFlashback episode reveals Liese and her friend Adabelle were former members of the Babysitter’s Detective Agency. Seth has notes for TSW’s use of flashback. However, Liese and Adabelle think it is Liese’s husband, Packer who committed the murder, not one of the twins (Chote is free but living a double life to protect Phillip, the jailed twin, from becoming a social pariah)\n\nBottle Episode! Weird because Butternut has a lot of money for New York based advertisements, but apparently not enough for content/location budgets?! Adabelle and Packer are on a date. Packer reveals he was with Adabelle at the time of the murder, but she won’t admit it. They are having an affair! And! The steak-house waiter can’t read a room! Surprise, some kid is livestreaming the interaction! Chote reveals a smart-phone to his scarf-clad mother while at their beach house. Cliff-hanger. **Gasp**\n\nSeth begins to hawk Butternut content: Mine Your Own Business. He announces Butternut has rebranded to Bytternyt (the Us are now Ys).\n\nTSW was off the week of April 22nd, in lieu of telling their growing fanbase (not bigger than Yellowstone’s), Bytternyt opted to air an hour of black screen followed by a message saying that TSW would return next week.\n\nGood news: Packer’s not the killer. Bad news: Liese’s best friend, Adabelle, is having an affair with her husband, Packer. Liese and Packer talk out their relationship. Liese then confronts Packer about relationship with Det. Delgado (from yearbook). Packer says the yearbook must be a deep fake. Chote comes home from yearbook club. Another cliff-hanger.\n\nSeth clears the Edgerton v EdGerton confusion. He then clarifies that the director is neither of the Australian actors but Joe Ledgerton.\n\nSummary time! Chote is on trial now? Detective Delgado is on the stand and is apparently deaf thanks to his role in the murder investigation(?) Twist! He hears Liese call him an a-hole from the gallery.\n\nMistrial!\n\nChote is free.\n\nLiese walks her son out of the court house. He nudges her saying, “Hey, mom that was really smart. How’d you know how to do that?”. She looks at him then off to the distance, “I guess all we needed was a” she turns, smirking directly into the camera, “tiny secret whisper”. Freeze frame. Credits roll over her 4th wall breaking smirk. Very post-Wandavision.\n\nSeth campaigns for TSW: Best Limited Series, Best Lead Actor in a Limited Series- Joel Edgerton, Best Director- Joe LedGerton, Best Lead Actress in a Limited Series- that British lady who is in everything.\n\nCicada, Cicada\n\nCicada, Cicada, Seth’s official foray onto the Great White Way. What do we know about the official plot, timeline, or production of the era specific musical? Barely a thing. Thanks to his connections however, Meyers, white, sans-lived cicada experience, and a playwright with NO BROADWAY EXPERIENCE,* already has big names and big buck$ attached to the project. Although he makes plenty of references to the writing and plot development of Cicada, Cicada over the course of monologues and riffs with guests, I can’t plot out the musical’s whole timeline (@LNSM hire me and I’ll do it. I’ll curate the best YouTube playlist @LateNightWithSethMeyers has ever seen!!)\n\nThe Plot: Christine Baranski (soft yes) plays a Broadway loving cicada who moves to the Big Apple during the pandemic (unaware of her predestined demise). Harvey Fierstein (hard yes) plays a “New York Mets loving” cockroach who lives in Broadway legend Nathan Lane’s (hard yes) apartment. The bugs are fast friends. The New York cockroach—tragically aware of the cicada’s fate and the pandemic’s toll on in person theatre—offers to move out of Lane’s apartment in exchange for his putting on a one man show, fulfilling the cicada’s dreams.\n\nAlso a lot of the Mets (unconfirmed) will be in it? They (as individuals and as a team) will get better as the play goes on\n\nAt some point the cockroach must make a choice…see the Mets or see Nathan Lane’s one man show with the cicada who does not know her days are numbered (17). He goes to the show and when he leaps up to give a standing ovation…the cicada is dead. The show takes place over the entire 17 day life of the cicada. Tragic.\n\nIt should be noted that discussions of finer plot details have varied. As seen here. Although the characters seem set in stone, we cannot confirm which plot is cannon as this publication** was denied media passes for previews. A June 7, 2021 report states that Fierstein-Cockroach asks Nathan Lane (as Nathan Lane) to put on a show with all his Broadway friends (despite period appropriate Covid regulations, we assume) rather than a one-man show. This report also details that only after Baranski-Cicada and Fierstein-Cockroach experience the magic of Broadway and Baranski-Cicada dies, Fierstein-Cockroach interacts with the Mets, going to a game by himself and cryng, for the first time in his life, “not because of the death of his friend, but because the Mets blow a four run lead in the ninth”. The finale in this version is a “torch song” called “Where Have You Gone, John Franco” rather than the other reported finale, the silent in-theatre death of the titular cicada.\n\nSeth reveals one lyric he wrote rhymes “Jesse Rosco” with “arm from a Costco”\n\nFierstein-Cockroach has power ballad complaining about the smoking ban called “My Titanic Hit a Bloomberg”\n\nTWIST: The title song, “Cicada, Cicada” isn’t about the bugs, their friendship, or the end of Act II subject change (bugs to Mets), it is sung “by Cuban American John Secada, and how sometimes people say his name wrong.”\n\nAs of September 6, 2022, Baranski reported the characters and script still needs a lot of work; although she expects big “out of town” (derogatory) ticket sales.\n\n*I did “the math.” Although there was a Company themed episode in Season “53” of Documentary Now, it doesn’t count as Broadway experience. Theatre-themed Emmy eligible work ≠ Broadway experience.\n\n**my twitter account (?) so, basically just me :P\n\nThe Corrections Era (Phase 5)\n\n“Anybody who’s watching this right now online and they’re going to write…they’re comments are going to be like, ‘Uhh, I can’t believe this was on TV.’ It’s fucking not. It’s only for YouTube. Just looks like it’s on TV cause we’re paying TV money to make it.” -Seth Meyers, CORRECTIONS: Week of Monday March 8\n\nThe first ever episode of Corrections was posted to YouTube by the official Late Night with Seth Meyers YouTube Channel on March 5, 2021, addressing his mispronunciation of the character “Babbar” and a mistranslation of the German word “cliffhanger”. He goes on to say, “But again, I also want to point out that, you know, when I make mistakes and you guys call them out and then I take time on the show to correct them, that doesn’t mean you should keep pointing them out…I mean if you want to that’s fine. That’s your prergovative [sic]. But we’re just trying to do our best here.”. This statement was many a Jackal’s villain origin story…and thus was born the weekly (posted Friday mornings), EMMY NOMINATED, segment, Corrections.\n\nAs of March 16, 2022, there are almost NINE HOURS (8:56ish..that’s 536 minutes and ten seconds*) of Corrections. Below, I have done my best to disregard everything I have learned from McSweeney’s to E.B. White… So that you, questioning Jackal, do not have to consume—what amounts to—nearly three consecutive viewings of Avengers: Endgame worth of Emmy-losing (not even on TV) content. Click here to view highlights of the highlights in graph form…the corrections, “fun facts,” and explanations that have made up the last year.\n\n*I’ve never claimed to have a strong grasp on math, numbers, units, or showing my work. also clock math is hard.\n\nJackals\n\nJackal culture is an extension of the long and oft overlooked tradition of YouTube commenters and trolls. You might even say Jackals descend from the Elizabethan theatre tradition of groundlings throwing tomatoes dried figs and oyster shells at the stage. This particular evolution of heckler however, leverages words, pronunciations, joke anatomy and misused phrases more than rotten foods. I use the term Jackal liberally throughout my run down of Corrections, but Meyers begins using the phrase around week eight or nine of Corrections, debuting it officially on desk mugs and used as an affectionate slur the Week of June 7, 2021. Jackals are everybody and nobody. They are everywhere and nowhere, have an anecdote for everything, and seldom lay down their weapons. Jackals are a quarter of Corrections…the most important quarter after The Crew and Amber’s Laugh, trailed by Meyers himself.\n\nHighlights\n\nWeek of 3/8 Message: \"This area has been cleaned & disinfected\" [Run Time: 2:58]\n\nCriminy, Kabul, pundi(n)ts, Phil Gates\n\nMikey the Shoe (MTS) contributes to mispronunciation issues\n\nAlex Baze wrote a bad joke about it\n\nWeek of 3/15 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected” [Run Time: 6:04]\n\nSeth corrects multiple corrections from the previous week\n\nThrows America’s sweetheart, Amber Ruffin, under the bus for some misplaced New Zealand humor\n\nApologizes for famed tank top lover, Mike Scollins\n\nSeth begs YouTube commenters, “if it’s an either/or…let it go.”\n\nInforms people who make nitpicky corrections that:\n\nThis bit is self-indulgent and not worth it.\n\nThis segment is the last thing Seth and the crew do before going home.\n\nAmber replies: “Seth, this segment is not good for you. You have to stop doing this.”\n\nWeek of 3/22 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected” [Run Time: 6:23]\n\nIrish Prime Minister = Taoiseach. Seth does not trust his ability to pronounce it correctly, saying he will probably just keep saying Prime Minister of Ireland.\n\nIssues with joke-graphic continuity (Camaro vs. Pontiac Trans-Am)\n\nMORE issues with joke-photo continuity (this time in reference to Nick Cage vs. Nick Coppola)\n\nCorrections BASED on previous Corrections\n\nLots of Hobbit/Lord of the Rings humor…idk I’m not a NERD\n\nSeth’s plea of the week, “I’m just saying guys, like I know everything you nit-pick I then make time for…and draw attention to it…in a way almost rewarding you. But you gotta stop. Cause I can’t.”\n\nWeek of 4/12 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected” [Run Time: 7:15]\n\nVocabulary choices/pronunciations…jackals exhibit poor understanding of homonyms\n\nCorrections of corrections of corrections regarding Irish political institutions\n\nSeth unpacks the surprising love triangle between Benjamin Franklin, his non-wife Debra, and her runaway groom, Luke Skywalker\n\nLOTR corrections\n\nWeek of 4/19 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected”[Run Time: 10:13]\n\nDebra and Candace are both names that have been around since the Bible but Candace means queen, similar to title Pharaoh. This, of course, explains the popular Biblical phrase, “Yas, Candace!”\n\nCorrections made regarding members of the band Journey\n\nJackals actually exhibit a poor understanding of polysemic words, not homonyms\n\nJoke-graphic continuity issues, Seth must consult MTS for an appropriate slur (philistine) to hurl at jackals who don’t know about wine.\n\nPhilistine ALSO from the Bible! The term refers to Phillis Stein, an Israelite, who was hostile to the arts. She did not care for museums or nice wine often saying, “Who am I, the Candace of Sheba?!!”.\n\nHer husband, Irving Stein, did very little to try and endear his wife to the arts.\n\nPhillis Stein (philistine) is someone hostile or indifferent to the arts\n\nIrving Stein (irvinstine) is someone hostile or indifferent to a philistine.\n\n2nd week of Pogs jokes (no idea about this, I was born in ‘98)\n\nSeth’s plea, “No one in my life thinks it’s good I’m doing this.”. He reiterates that Corrections is a DIGITAL EXCLUSIVE\n\nWeek of 4/26 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected” [Run Time: 11:40]\n\nDigital Exclusive is not a fancy word for ‘Not good enough for TV’, it’s fancy word-ssssssss\n\nSeth corrects jackals, mostly just talking through his jokes…since UCB closed in NY, I guess this is how we’re supposed to learn comedy(?)\n\nMike Shoemaker aside (Mikey Shoemaker from the Bronx): regarding the likelihood that he was or was not present at Studio 54. Seth rounds out this thought exercise with an impression and confirmation that it is Shoemaker who keeps himself off camera, not Seth’s ego.\n\nGeographic joke-continuity issues devolve into a rousing discussion of corporations, parent companies, and Lego (Lego bricks NOT Legos)\n\nSeth subtly jabs, the typically late-night-host loving brand, “Ben & Jerry’s” asking, “Did you hear we’re getting our own Ben & Jerry’s flavor?...neither did…Neither. Did. I…Feels like it should’ve happened.”\n\nClaims he doesn’t have a flavor because he’s from New Hampshire and B&J’s is, of course, a Vermont company. He continues, speculating they would sooner make “Kim Jung Chill” than an LNSM themed flavor…presumably… “A Closer Lick”.\n\nSeth corrects “A Closer Lick” because it sounds like a B&J’s flavor that someone would carry in their trench coat. This, OF COURSE, is a reference to the fairly held assumption that men—typically late to middle aged, always white—wearing trench coats do so not in reaction to the fluctuations of springtime weather, but as a means to flash their—sometimes erect, but most often flaccid—penis at unsuspecting (although the trench coat usually gives it away) individuals.\n\nVince Vaughn vs. Jeff Goldblum impression CLARIFICATIONS (Goldblum is “up here”, “buddy, buddy, buddy,” is “down here”)\n\nReturn of @seacaptainpolls\n\nIcelandic gnome/troll discourse\n\nSeth defends his use of an Irish accent for the character of Icelandic troll\n\nalso…Irish trolls more likely to say, “Digital Exclusive is two words”.\n\nWeek of 5/3 Message: “This area has been covered in germs” [Run Time: 9:59]\n\nPronunciation wars between American and European/Australian jackals\n\nAlleged effort to keep the segment under ten minutes after comments from Mikey the Shoe…resulting in more vague Shoemaker impressions\n\nB&J’s discourse continues…Seth pitches “Late Night with Seth Breyers”\n\nThere is an Irish gnome troll, but he works in Iceland. Does he need an Icelandic Visa? The exercise in immigration law continues. The issue is further complicated by Brexit, especially because in this thought experiment we do not know whether the Irish gnome, troll, or fairy is from the Republic of Ireland (EU) or Northern Ireland (UK). Further research likely required into Catholic-Elvish relations (probably not great) and British colonialism of Elvish territories (probably worse). The fantastical geopolitical crisis continues…\n\nFox be damned, LNSM is the place to find real cancel culture debates (i.e. Prince Charming and necrophilia)\n\nJackals make grammatical corrections on Seth’s revelations about a childhood defined by his mother, a French teacher, and his, apparently absentee, English teacher.\n\nWeek of 5/10 Message: “This Desk is Vaccinated” [Run Time: 11:38]\n\nIssue with Joke-Graphic-Reality equilibrium: Jackals take issue with a joke about a cockroach smoking a Marlboro Light because the graphic not only did not depict a realistic Marlboro, cockroaches, apparently, don’t breathe out of their mouth, but holes on their belly(?)…so the cigarette should be inhaled at one of the belly holes(?).\n\nA Spelling Error correction brings out a scary Seth-puppet master voice (?)\n\nJackals add insult to (previous) injury…see Week of 5/3, subsection English teacher, subsection lack of. (keyword: Hilary Meyers)\n\nMore on Prince Charming (kissed a dead 14 year old)\n\nMike-“The Taskmaster”-Shoemaker: Seth reveals more about the New York-based man of mystery: he knows what’s what in the twentieth century true crime department but does not foster a love of law enforcement.\n\nWeek of 5/17 Message: N/A [Run Time: 13:47]\n\n“Corrections” time jokes continue\n\nMistake vs. Liberty discourse devolves into small jabs at Jackals\n\nPuppet Master (see Week of 5/10) is actually “Taskmaster” which is different from “Werner Herzog”\n\nCockroach smoking a cigarette discourse rolls over into alligator smoking a vape pen discourse…Joke-Graphic-Reality be damned…LNSM showed a crocodile smoking a vape pen. Seth claims that alligators are typically not receptive to his style of jokes.\n\nSeth corrects jackals…it is “Pleaded guilty” not “Pled guilty” even though pled sounds better. In regards to further discourse he said, “YOU’RE WRONG, YOU’RE WRONG, YOU’RE WRONG!”\n\nVocabulary misunderstanding forces Seth to stop saying some thing or event is the “definition of” something else, replacing it with “the epitome of”. Example: To call that out is the epitome of pedantic.\n\nShoemaker apparently often says, “I’m not afraid of nobody.” which is a double negative. Seth recounts giving Mikey the Shoe this correction. Turns out MTS (Mikey the Shoe) IS scared of everyone. After confiding in his long-time colleague, MTS asked for a hug. Seth initiated the gesture of affection until he recieved a swift knee to the balls. While writhing in pain MTS asked, “Did I get both of them?”. Seth responded, “Uh YA!”. To which MTS said, “That’s what I call a double negative!”.\n\nWeek of 5/24 Message: “This Segment is a Cry for Help” [Run Time: 12:45]\n\nSeth addresses frequent title card changes (“Online Inclusive”). He justifies this by saying Corrections is very inclusive because “all you need is an internet connection and a total lack of boundaries”\n\n“Definition of” Discourse continues: his former correction statement was corrected to the grammatically correct “epitome of pedantry (noun)”.\n\nVerb-Joke agreement issue\n\nsmoking : cigarette :: vaping : vape pen\n\nCanadian jackals are polite when they jackal\n\nSeth’s Werner Herzog (existential) IS NOT his Christoph Waltz (enthusiastic) which is also not his John Malkovich (which is “up here”)\n\nSeth’s Celebrity Story Tangent: (Tangent within my Stoopid Lil Corrections Essay! The Seth Meyers sketch referenced—and laboriously located via Peacock—on page three of this document, J’accuzzi, was from the same show as The Lost Work of Judy Bloom, the sketch providing Malkovich with the comfortable pink turtle neck and overalls that the celebrated actor wore all day…to Seth’s delight…I connected both of our tangents! :P )\n\n80085 Correction: 80085 on an old calculator…when turned upside down…titillating!\n\nMikey the Shoe (Seth’s Version) vs. Tony the Fouch (Seth’s Version)\n\nSeth compares the nuances of the two impressions.\n\nWeek of 6/7 Message: “Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?” [Run Time: 19:20] Mug: “Jackal Paws/ Attack Flaws”\n\nMore 80085 Discourse: can’t forget 5,318,008 **flip** = boobies!\n\nWerner Herzog impression no longer critiqued for proximity to Christoph Waltz or John Malkovich, but for incorrectly asserting that animal noises are trans-linguistic.\n\nName Pronunciation error\n\nSpelling Discourse: Junky (William S. Burrows and Donald Trump) vs. Junkie (everybody else)\n\nMore on German animal noises (kikiriki)\n\nCicada, Cicada is allegedly a finished piece of art. This is, of course, brought up in relation to the onslaught of cicada related news during the Summer of ’21.\n\nSeth’s friend Peter Grosz is in the audience. He played the Hamburgler(?)\n\nSeth detects malice behind the following comment: “He bro, what’s up with the tan? You have the same taint as Donald Trump.” Seth thinks the commenter meant “tint” and it had been bugging him for months.\n\nImpression Discourse (Fight!): Seth gives in and admits his Christoph Waltz isn’t great…goes off on MTS tangent outlined below\n\nChristoph Waltz’ reveal in Inglourious Basterds was taintamount [sic] (callback) to Seth’s brief appearance in Journey to the Center of the Earth: 3D (2008)\n\nDESPITE only taking part in surface-of-the-Earth plot, Seth’s character was included in a collection of trading cards, also 3D\n\nSomeone outside of SNL asked Seth to sign his Journey to the Center of the Earth: 3D trading card\n\nSeth only signed one card…ONE Seth Meyers autographed Journey to the Center of the Earth: 3D trading card was listed for sale on eBay\n\nAssuming the autographed Seth Meyers trading card was not a forgery, MTS bought the trading card Seth signed outside of SNL and hung it on his wall\n\nWhy? Because **in Seth’s MTS voice** “Maybe I’m proud of you…might not have been the best movie, but you were in it…on the big screen…in 3D. SO it was worth every penny I paid for it, to have it up on my wall.\n\nSIKE! Seth was almost fooled, but MTS said eBay basically paid him to take it off their hands. The frenemies continue… One with a lot of screen time and one without a Wikipedia page. One with an arsenal of half-baked impressions, the other, one who hates Borat (?). Both have one Emmy.

Seth pitches a WWII film where eleven American hens and one American rooster, called The Dirty Dozen, are smuggled into a German camp (a farm) and must steal their secrets. The movie is their journey across enemy lines. They fool the border guards and are almost back to safety but the sun comes out. The rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo instead of the German kikiriki. The hens make it to an allied hill top and watch the rooster wink at them before he is beheaded and runs around for like five minutes.\n\nAlex Baze f***ed up. He never f***s up. MTS is pissed Meyers tried to correct Baze. Meyers jokes about firing MTS and he does not take it well. He tries to console MTS, telling his long-time producer, “of course you could do something else. You could do anything you want to do. What is it you’ve always wanted to do?”. MTS looks at his pal Seth. SIKE! MTS says, “Your motha!”.\n\nSeth realizes Corrections is Emmy eligible but says he is not the type to campaign. He says he’s happy with his single Emmy…but two would be nice for like book ends…\n\nWeek of 6/21 Message: “Perfect is the enemy of happy.” [Run Time 16:21] Mug(s): (left to right) **Image of a Jackal on a computer, presumably using their paws to attack flaws** “Jackal Paws/ Attack Flaws”\n\nFirst mentions of a comedic reeducation camp, unconfirmed if it is late night host specific\n\nInternational Jackals continue to wreak havoc\n\nA new Jackal faction emerges…intermediate drummers/step dads (?)\n\nNone of the three jabs Seth lobbed against Sal Gentile, Mets fan, hold up to jackal scrutiny…a hat trick of sorts\n\nImpression discourse\n\nSeth is a Steven Segal apologist… “[he’s] not out for justice”\n\nA Dirty Dozen Update: German viewers point out that in Germany eggs are sold in tens, not dozens, really throwing a wrench in the WWII chicken spy dramedy(?). ALSO roosters can’t wink thanks the anatomy of their eyes…rendering Seth’s dramatic finale a pipe dream. He reimagines the scene by adding a German walrus captain, Christoph Waltrus, who, while threatening the escaped hens following the execution of the rooster, is beheaded by the body of the rooster, running around ~carrying an axe~ with his head chopped off. The movie will be targeted towards children.\n\nCivil war erupts amongst jackals. They begin correcting corrections before they officially become corrections.\n\nMTS update: MTS is a bad gift giver (according to Seth). Seth recounts how one year for Christmas he got MTS a beautiful gold goblet and MTS gave him a pair of ratty fingerless gloves. MTS asked Seth if he liked the gift to which Seth replied, “No, I don’t like them at all…I just don’t like fingerless gloves.”. To this MTS replied, “Well I got you a couple of fingers too!” as he flipped Seth off on both hands\n\nWeek of 7/12 Message: “Release the Kraken.” [Run Time 15:40] Mug:**image of two jackal paws**\n\nCorrections is Emmy nominated babbbyyyyyy\n\n“Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama, or Variety Series” “which…it feels like we tik all of those boxes” -Seth Meyers\n\nRooster Anatomy Discourse (part three)\n\nThe ACTUAL ORIGINAL INSPIRATION FOR THIS WRITE UP\n\nNordic (Icelandic) pronunciation issues\n\nSeth points out the disparity between verbal flubs and graphic flubs. Where in the first case he sometimes gets away with it, there no room for error in regards to the latter. All of this, of course, thanks to DOB discrepancies on a cockroach’s driver’s license. (Later, a cicada’s DL)\n\nSeth’s Drive Thru Appendectomy: Jackals take issue with the location of the incision and that Seth should be wearing a mask.

The two longtime 30 Rockers went to a fancy dinner at a restaurant called 11 Madison Park. MTS asked Seth, “Why do you think I wanted to go to 11 Madison Park?”. Once Seth didn’t get the right answer, MTS responded:\n\nWeek of 7/19 Message: “Vote NO on LORDE!” [Run Time 13:49] Mug: Image of jackal paws on a keyboard\n\nYou feed a chicken, chicken feed, not chicken seed\n\nIcelandic pronunciation discourse keeps going\n\nJackal corrections turning more into a way for Seth to insult his dedicated viewers.\n\nStar Trek mistakes\n\nJackals v. Lorde stans\n\nShark anatomy and drug addiction discourse: Regarding a toothless shark addicted to crystal meth, jackals point out that sharks’ teeth regenerate…so they would just grow back. Seth uses this time to remind viewers that teeth are not an accurate way to tell if your shark friend is actually clean\n\nSeth quells rumors (from his beloved comments) that an intern is responsible for screening through comments for corrections. He promises, it’s him.\n\nSeth’s Drive Thru Appendectomy (Week 2): Graphic does not depict the right incision location AND has Seth driving the wrong way through a drive thru. This is the straw that broke the camel’s back in regards to Seth’s relationship with the graphics department. When he confronted them about it, he found they did it on purpose. They, as a department, are really into negging.\n\nJackal discourse surrounding the LNSM prop budget focusses on an Employee ID (the singular prop) featuring the wrong media conglomerate title AND how badly Seth needs a manicure, as his fingers were featured during a close up of the mock ID. He blames Corrections for his nail-biting habit, because “[he] use to feel good about [himself] and what [he] did”.\n\nMTS allegedly pointed out Seth’s hang nails while Seth was working on the first Corrections, specifically pointing to the Legos vs. Lego bricks conundrum. Seth imagines holding an Emmy with beautiful hands and promises to try and kick the habit.\n\nWeek of 8/9 Message: “LORDE IS BAD AT PAINTING.” [Run Time 12:08] Mug: Jackeé\n\nSeth did Fresh Air in person. He’s also really humble about it.\n\nSelected dialogue of the week:\n\nJackal: “What gringa on your staff thought [the song “Gasolina”] was by Pitbull”\n\nMeyers: “Se llama Alex Baze”\n\nMeyers: “El es un hombre grande no joven”\n\nBaze was referring to the “Gasolina” remix featuring Pitbull. He loves remixes of songs, not of his jokes.\n\nThe war on graphic continues, this time regarding proper flute positioning…apparently they are only held to the right.\n\nSeth’s Drive Thru Appendectomy (Week 5): Graphic errors continue\n\nWrong location for an appendectomy incision\n\nShould be wearing a mask\n\nDriving the wrong way through a drive thru (based on arrow)\n\n(New) Q: Why does Seth have a guitar? A: Graphics Team likes to get in trouble (see Week of 7/19, keyword: negging)\n\nSeth jokes that if Trump asked Giuliani to set something up at the Waldorf Astoria he would go to the Walmart in Astoria, knowing there was no Walmart in Astoria. He knew he was choosing comedy over reality.\n\nThe Grand Knitting Nightmare (BEGINS): Seth substitutes crochet for knitting. The knitting community is aghast. Soon, the entire yarn-based craft community feels stereotyped, shunned, and silenced by LNSM.\n\nJackal merch not available in stores because NBCUniversal, the multinational media conglomerate, HATES MONEY.\n\nFirst official mention of mugs comes thanks to a correction: The jackal paws featured on top of a keyboard are not anatomically correct. LNSM (Graphic Department) has been using a the image of one front jackal paw and one hind jackal paw. One concerned Jackal points out, “that’s not how a jackal would type”. The image LNSM featured implies that the jackal is lying on their side typing.\n\nIn a staggering show of humility and pro-democratic tendencies (see early days of @secaptainpolls), Seth admits to using the @seacaptainpolls Twitter account to gerrymander a pro-Meyers (anti-Lorde) election. Realizing his brain was being slowly taken over by his Giuliani impression, Meyers apologizes for trying to rig an election.\n\nGrammatical and anatomical correctness combine for this glorious correction: In response to Seth saying, in regards to Honey Baked Ham (the store), “I can’t believe there are people just walking in there, buying a whole ass ham.”. Correction: “Correction: Technically whole ass ham is redundant because ham comes from an area of the pig that could arguably be considered its ass. And also, it would only be a half-ass ham because it’s only one half of the pig’s ass.”\n\nWeek of 8/17 (As in the Week of Tuesday, Aug 17) Message: “A vote for Corrections is a vote for YOU!” [Run Time 15:06] Mug: An image of the LNSM logo, edited to read, “Late Night with Half-Ass Ham”\n\nVince Vaughn impressions continue (“Buddy, buddy, buddy”) despite toxic Marvel stan/Jackal sub-sect protests erupting after Seth, ALLEGED COMIC BOOK NERD, thinks a Vaughn cameo in Loki would be a great opportunity for “Buddy, buddy, buddy,” not realizing the image he used included four Loki variants (Classic Loki, Kid Loki, Boastful Loki, AND Alligator Loki). Seth says his Vaughn impression doesn’t work with four “Buddies” so he’s either in favor of Loki erasure or need to reassess how structures his jokes\n\nPronunciation corrections\n\nCorrections of corrections continue, clarifying that there ARE left-handed flutes. They’re just more expensive. Seth panders to the leading left-handed flute maker.\n\nIn a perfect example of how LNSM combines “high” and “low” culture, he ends this point with a fart joke. See! There is something for everyone.\n\nHomonym adjacent correction: Mike Lindell is not a pillow magnet. He is a pillow magnate. He is a lawsuit magnet. Also, according to Seth, he is bad at website copy and clarity.\n\nResponding to a Lindell impression correction (a L-impr-ection)*, complaining that the Pillow magnate is from Minnesota, not Chicago as The Super Fan impression implies, Seth states, “He is from Minnesota. But, I learned a lesson this year and that lesson is: sometimes what you want to be true is more important than what is actually true. And I learned that from Mike Lindell.”\n\nWalmart in Astoria (Week 2): Oregonian jackals point out that there is a Walmart in Astoria, Oregon. Seth is not sure the joke stands though because technically the Walmart is in Warrenton, Oregon.\n\nLNSM (original) and Corrections turns into the ouroboros, the snake eating itself, as the original protects itself from the monster it created (Jackals): Seth reveals that internal Jackals (fact-checkers) warned him of a timeline issue in his Prince of Tides joke. He was faced with either a timeline or semantic error, ultimately deciding that timeline accuracy was more important to Jackals.\n\nSeth notes that Jackals (in the content and frequency of their comments) often hint towards amphetamine abuse, saying they give off a “methy energy”.**\n\nNotes on Seth’s poor pronunciation of pundit and an ensuing bad pun\n\nEmmy voting is open as of the release of this episode. By mentioning his fellow nominees, Seth makes his moral high-ground known.\n\n*See, I can do the high-low thing too. lol, Late Night should like totally hire me or something :P\n\n**If. It’s. Taken. As. Prescribed. Abuse. It. Is. Not. (said, as I open my 79th tab and hit my 33rd page of nonsense)\n\nWeek of 8/23 Message(s): (1)“KNIT ONE. PEARL TWO. RELAX THREE.” (2) NOLITE FACERE TEPORIS TORPORIBUS.” [Run Time 12:47] Mug: Image of Fine Young Cannibals front man, Roland Gift, with the band’s initials presented in era inaccurate hashtag form (#FYC)\n\nSurprise! Many Jackals are also NYT Spelling Bee players. NAWT.\n\nLaGuardia-related errors span from the Writers’ Room to the Graphics Department. In response Seth negs, “You have jackal hearts, jackal brains, eagle eyes…What would a jackal with eagle eyes even look like?...”\n\n“…I guess like this:\n\nVince Vaughn impression correction: “four buddies” is more like Twiki, the robot from the 1978 Battlestar Galactica (a shared favorite between Seth and MTS)\n\nSeth pitches a Battlestar Galactica remake with Owen Wilson as Starbuck and Vince Vaughn as Twiki\n\nThe Grand Knitting Nightmare (Week 2): The yarn-based craft community gathered reinforcements after previous LNSM attacks and come back swinging. They assert themselves as alphas amongst the Jackal community and do not intend on submitting to Seth. In a non-Jackal/Graphics Department way, knitters say no to negging. Seth must step back and reevaluate how to flirt with them. He makes the following remarks regarding the community:\n\nOf all ages\n\nCurse like sailors\n\nDon’t have a great sense of humor about knitting jokes\n\nSeth clarifies the mission and vision of my (now 34 page) project… “Corrections is meant to be seen as a whole. Ideally you have to watch all of them…If you’re coming in late you’re missing so much.”\n\nSeth submits to Knitters (and the Marching Band community)\n\nWalmart in Astoria (Week 3): The Walmart is in Warrenton, Oregon. But, the Astoria Airport is also in Warrenton so there’s definitely some wiggle room. Seth adopts a distinctly Jackal trait, adjacent fun facts, adding that Goonies was filmed in Astoria, Oregon. In pure Meyers fashion however, he ties the tangent back to himself, remembering that the motto of the impression camp he recently attended was “Don’t Do Sloth” (translated, of course, from Latin).\n\nImpressions Camp: Seth clarifies one of his jokes in light of a misunderstanding among Jackals:\n\nWhen he did his McConaughey, his counselor did in fact hung himself. Jackals thought this meant Seth’s McConaughey impression prompted his counselor to try and kill himself (and therefore hanged himself). No! The counselor did not consider suicide, rather they found a passive aggressive action that would shame Seth into remembering that McConaughey-s are generally hack: After Seth delivered the (hacky) impression, the counselor moved a chair over to a coat rack, hooked himself (via his coat) onto the coat rack, kicked over the chair, and hung himself.\n\nImpressions Camp is revealed to be a quite toxic place (for further inquiry see the fall of UCB)\n\nLast Corrections ep during Emmy voting\n\nWeek of 9/6 Message: (1) “NERD CARD **Marked by a REVOKED stamp**” (2) “A Vote For Me Is A Vote for YOU!” [Run Time 14:08] Mug: Image of a sloth with a Ghost Busters-esque circle and slash over it.\n\nSeth corrects himself and reminds the Jackals, “Don’t eat paste.”.\n\nThe Grand Knitting Nightmare (Week 3): Seth apologizes for misspelling “Purl,” the knitting term, as “pearl” the little ocean treat, on the back of the previous episode’s notes. He continues to stir the pot despite the proven hostility of the knitting community.\n\nTwiki the robot is from Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, NOT Battlestar Galactica. Seth tries to quell growing unease with the nature and sincerity of Corrections, amid accusations that he purposefully makes mistakes. Many refer to this phenomenon as “Jackal-bait”.*\n\nSeth takes on Jackal behavior calling out Buck Rogers for not getting future robots right.\n\nHe then calls Gil Gerrard, Gil Faizon, the infamous Upper West-Sider.\n\nMTA based humor\n\nSeth said “I’ll see you in October.” Jackals point out that he will not see us. We see him.\n\nWalmart in Astoria (Week 6): It’s The Goonies, not Goonies. Seth uses this time to do more free press for Astoria, Oregon. It just so happens that a lot of movies have been shot in Astoria: Short Circuit, Kindergarten Cop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3, Ring 2. Seth asks the people of Astoria if they have a lot of film tourism.\n\nImpression Camp: “Don’t Do Sloth” motto and reminder. The Latin phrase was on the back of the second page of notes from the previous week’s episode…Jackals take issue with Impression Camp’s Latin translation…because, unsurprisingly, a lot of Jackals are also experts at a dead language.\n\n“You’ll see me next week. Happy!?”\n\n*By writing about dishonesty between a man in a position of power seeming to pull allllll the strings, deciding what’s true and false, and likely plotting conspiracy, I feel empowered to call this entire era “Jackal-bait-gate”.\n\nWeek of 9/13 Message: (1) “Deskpool Jokeoke” [Run Time 17:36] Mug: **In the style of Keep Calm and Carry On** “JACKALS RAISE MY HACKALS”\n\nWalmart in Astoria (Week 7): The Ring 2 was shot in Astoria, not Ring 2. Oregonian Jackals reveal that there is an Astoria film history museum in the jail from Goonies.\n\nImpression Camp Motto Update: even self-proclaimed Latin experts translated “Don’t Do Sloth” with varying degrees of intellectual-superiority. One constant, Sloth, a character name, should not be translated. Seth attributes one of the faults of the contemporary Catholic Church to this translation inconsistency…lending to an environment of too many priests using Sloth in their material.\n\nSeth pantomimed as a smoking horse, incorrectly (calling back to an early Jackal-Seth interaction, the smoking cockroach). He corrects his pantomime to reflect proper horse anatomy. He decides smoking pigs, given their cloven hooves, would be a better option for future smoking animal pantomimes.\n\nThe graphics department executed a stellar reimagining of the infamous Thanos snap where Seth snaps and Wally turns to dust. Jackals point out that while Wally would have disappeared his card should have remained. Seth clarifies that although most people’s accessories were left behind, cue cards are actually a part of Wally. Thus, they too would have turned to dust. In a stunning reveal of Wally’s origin story, we find out that he exited the womb holding a tiny cue-card reading, “IT’S A BOY!!”.\n\nThe Grand Knitting Nightmare (Week 4): One of the leading voices in the knitting community found proof that Seth has been exhibiting disparaging behavior towards the yarn based craft community for much of his public life. And, she publishes the receipts.\n\nRuh ROhhh\n\nThe Graphics Department, despite experiencing early-week positive feedback, prefers negging and true to LNSM form, sometimes seems to bait it. Seth reveals internal debates regarding this image: Although Seth takes issues with the car make and model, Jackals take issue with graphic-joke continuity, as the joke described a skeleton sitting in traffic and the image showed a skeleton driving so fast that it was blurry.\n\nSeth debriefs Jackals and the LNSM team on their second place finish at the Emmys. Seth loosely considers changing the title “Corrections” to something more in line with the Emmy winner…as referenced in the back-of-note message of the week.\n\n“See me next week”\n\nWeek of 9/20 Message: “Knit/Purl/MATCH!” [Run Time 16:33] Mug: More like “Jerkels”\n\nBiggest flub of previous Corrections: Seth says the phrase “on accident” instead of “by accident”.\n\nAdverb misuse allegations\n\nSeth and MTS once rented a Kia Optima (or Kia Optima adjacent vehicle) while in LA. At the valet they ran into Jason Statham and experienced a moment of terror, imaging the cool car Statham likely drove in comparison to their Kia. But wouldn’t you know it?! The valet pulled up with Statham’s car and it was a Kia Optima. In a parallel line of thinking, Seth compares his companion, MTS, to Stathem’s companion, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Very NY vs. LA.\n\nWalmart in Astoria (Week 8): Oregon: Also home to the last surviving Blockbuster. Seth thinks he’s being pranked by Jackals who say it is pronounced ASS-toria.\n\nGraphics Department displays their infamously poor grasp on anatomical correctness, especially among New York-centric vermin: rendering a pigeon wearing a snorkel in response to NY flooding, without covering the pigeon’s nostrils with their goggles.\n\nClarification that Seth used #FYC not to Emmy campaign but in support of the band Fine Young Cannibals from 2 week prior, prompts him to Facetime Andy Samberg, a master Roland Gift impressionist.\n\nAndy sings “She Drives You Crazy” as Roland Gift\n\nHorse Smoking/Anatomical correctness converge again. This time, marking the probable end of different animals smoking discourse, a Jackal said, “At the end of the day, any animal who smokes is going to end up a little hoarse.”.\n\nIn a show of comedic growth, Jackals note that Seth missed an opportunity in last week’s Corrections by discussing a missing “L” in a graphic for Cauliflower Doritos and his bad Tom Brokaw impression, but not combining the two as Brokaw would probably pronounce cauliflower as the Graphic Department spelled it. Seth confirms.\n\nSome vaguely Jewish, Cue Card Wally world-building\n\nSeth receives a sweater from Patty Lyons, his one-time nemesis and vocal member of the Knitting Community, marking a cease fire between her compatriots and LNSM. Seth alleges that he and MTS orchestrated the LNSM vs. Knitting Community feud in an effort to procure a homemade sweater, knowing that they were (1) foul mouthed (2) sensitive and (3) predictable. He claims to have been playing the Knitting Community since he infamously posed knitting a crochet blanket…and returns to his Taskmaster voice.\n\n“See me next week”\n\nWeek of 9/27 Message: “The Gift of the Jagi” [Run Time 12:13] Mug:\n\nMost feedback of the week comes from a joke with an explosion in space. While some Jackals think this counts as a win, Seth reminds viewers that the Graphics Department loves to be negged and baits said negging as their favorite form of flirtation.\n\nAnatomical Correctness: Pigeon with a snorkel that does not cover it’s nostrils is featured in front of a brick wall…with the bricks going the wrong way (hotdog instead of hamburger).\n\nTHROWBACK regarding the pronunciation of the Irish term for prime minister and head of government, Taoiseach. Well, the Taoiseach was in 8G and nobody told Seth. He considers this as serious a betrayal as if no one told him Christoph Waltz and Werner Herzog came to visit and no one said anything.\n\nMTS Update: In light of MTS’ desire to remain anonymous, Seth sets out to describe him: “fairly non-descript middle age man, with the most lustrous head of hair…just long…down to the shoulders…beautiful blonde mane”. He adds that MTS is always flipping his hair and talking about how badly he wants antique brush.\n\nRandy Newman impression criticized for veering a little Bill Cosby.\n\nFacetime with Andy (Week 2): Facing a few comments about the previous week’s call, Seth tries to Facetime Andy again, this time to no avail. He addresses a perceived pronoun mix-up with a new rule: “…because that’s what you do when you request a song. You change the pronoun for the singer.”\n\nPantomime Corrections: General pantomimes based on existing and possible roles Seth might play in the Fast and Furious franchise…Jackals point out Seth does not appear to have a grasp on FF culture/content.\n\nOpera enthusiasts take issue with Seth calling Pavarotti a “B List Celebrity”. He clarifies that B List, when referring to Italians, means “bellissimo”\n\nSeth wears sweater sleeves because last week he was calling his sweater vest a sweater. He admits this mistake made him very upset. MTS noticed his pal was upset. The next day, MTS showed up to 30 Rock sans beautiful gold mane. When Seth inquired about his missing locks, MTS said that a wig maker had been hounding him for a while and he finally decided to sell his crown. “Why!”, Seth asked. At this, MTS pulled out a box saying he knew Seth had been down all week about the sweater vest thing. Seth opened the box, revealing two blue sleeves with yellow accents. MTS said, “Now it’s a sweater. You put that on the vest, you walk out there and you show those Jackals who you are.”. Teary eyed, Seth looked at his friend of 20 years, saying, “I can’t…I can’t…I sold the sweater to get you this.”. He pulled out the antique brush MTS told him he wanted.\n\n“See me next week.”\n\nWeek of 10/4 Message: n/a [Run Time 21:17] Mug: The Day of the Jackal (1973) movie poster with Seth’s face inside the sniper scope.\n\nO. Henry discourse regarding last week’s The Gift of the Magi\n\nA few Jackals mistakenly credit The Muppets 1978 Christmas Special\n\nA well-meaning Jackal mistakes Mikey the Shoe for Mike Scollins. Seth shakes his head, “No. They are both unpleasant in very different ways.”.\n\nAnatomical Correctness: Graphics Department still under fire from avian/snorkel enthusiasts for failing to cover the pigeon’s “nares”. Adding insult to injury, many more pile on, bereding the team for laying bricks the wrong way. However, some Jackals point out that it is a recognized form of brick laying called “soldier style”. At the expense of the group think of a comments thread, New York Jackals recognize the style from several subway stations. In a show of unity, Seth reminds viewers that the Graphics Department, despite being on the right side of history for once, are bad people.\n\nIrish political institutions. Seth compares his not being alerted that the Taoiseach was in Studio 8G, to if no one called him during a read through of Wedding Crashers 2 where neither Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn were available.\n\nFacetime with Andy (Week 3): Seth is frustrated that his dear friend didn’t pick up the week before. He asks his crew, “What’s he got going on where he can’t answer a phone call from me? Too busy writing down words that rhyme with nutsack?”. He proceeds to try and call again anyway…again, going unanswered.\n\nHe receives 2 calls during the rest of the segment, looking at the screen and saying “not him” before declining the call.\n\nMets corrections\n\nSeth apologizes to Allie Hoard for not appreciating her cancer-mouse joke during Surprise Inspection.\n\nRandy Newman impression notes\n\nREFLECTIONS: Seth looks back on 241 shows without an audience…He sheds his snarky-bully persona to address growing fear in the Jackal community that audiences will ruin the show’s new found emphasis on crew-based humor. He promises that Corrections will always be without an audience and, thanks to his new contract, Wally will not be denied air-time. Looking back, Seth remembers reading YouTube comments for the first time in The Attic Era, while searching for feedback, thanking his audience and crew for sticking around and creating something different and better.\n\nMTS Update: It is MTS’ birthday tomorrow and he makes a really big deal about it. Every year he makes guests wait at a venue in the Bronx while he hides in a gigantic cake. After two and a half or three hours he pops out saying, “Who’s your fucking O.Henry now?!”.\n\nNo comment regarding the sweater vest and the sweater sleeves finally coming together in sweater form. One sleeve falls off, Jackal/Yarn-Based-Craft community still starving for attention.\n\n“See me next week.”\n\nWeek of 10/11 Message: “This area has been cleaned & disinfected WITH LOVE.” [Run Time 17:31] Mug: Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) movie poster edited, reading, “Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hide” with images of Seth’s face\n\nAnatomical Correctness: Seth apologizes for mispronouncing nares which means pigeon nostril…but also human nostril. So, the whole thing is just kind of like…why?\n\nFacetime with Andy (Week 4): Seth gets a phone call…and declines it…was it Andy? Did he finish the list of words that rhyme with nut sack?\n\nFirst notes on having an audience back: Giuliani humor. Good. Giuliani married to his cousin humor. Not good. He finds this strange as Giuliani married to his cousin humor hit particularly well with the crew. “It tickled them. Not, you know…marrying a cousin. But I think the fact that he found out afterword.”\n\nGraphics also put Rudy in a graphic casket instead of a graphic coffin.\n\nThe correction that really started it all: said Legos instead of Lego bricks\n\nGrammatical error: “My brother and I” (incorrect) vs. “My brother and me” (correct)\n\nO. Henry (Week 3): Certain Jackals thought Seth ripped off The Gift of the Magi from the Sesame Street Christmas Special (1978) not The Muppets 1978 Christmas Special. Seth claims this is thanks to Gonzo’s blue balls.\n\nFacetime with Andy (Week 4): Seth successfully Facetimes Andy and asks him to sing Counting Crows’ “Mr. Jones and You”.\n\nGraphics renders an image of Donald Trump wearing rollerblades for a joke about him roller-skating. Classic.\n\nSeth reveals his brother, Mike Meyers, had long hair in college (possible inspo from the glorious days of long-hair-Seth) , rollerbladed, and was nicknamed the Albatross…long winded way of saying “my brother and me” (but started the whole thing tangent with “my brother and I”\n\nDisney-adults join in anti-Graphic Department rhetoric. Like most adults over-participating in childhood activities, they make it less fun\n\nSeth begs for wiggle room of plus or minus 5 ounces in his jokes.\n\nNail biting shifts to pen cap chewing\n\nThe audience is back and most Jackals realize it’s not that bad. Many take issue with holds for applause. Seth hypothesizes that this malice comes from a place of jealousy, “since the people in the audience are capable of feeling joy”.\n\nThere was a Jackal in the audience at his first Q&A\n\nVince Vaughn for an audience was “the Rudy’s cousin of [his impressions]”.\n\nSeth addresses allegations of LNSM using a laugh track…nope.\n\nSeth got a new hat from “now friend” Patty Lyons. (SIDEBAR: Seth jokes that if this video is your first Corrections, you probably stopped watching. NOT AFTER READING THIS BABBBIII.) AND! It’s double sided!\n\n“See me next week”\n\nWeek of 10/25 Message: “Tie game, Jost!” [Run Time 16:41] Mug: (1) Jackal-Lantern (2) Jackal-Intern (cartoon jackal (hyena) carrying a to-go coffee tray)\n\nThere cannot be a Grand Theft Auto: Civil War as there were no automobiles to thieve.\n\nSeth apologizes to Gritty for assuming he was anti-vax\n\nPantomime Corrections: Seth incorrectly mimed a phone call, breaking the reality of the imaginary phone. He notes that messing this up is particularly disappointing because “when it comes to one-sided phone call humor, I’m the new Bob Newhart. The Bob NEWHart. If you will”.\n\nGraphics Department\n\nMis-clothed Trump image in cheetah skin rather than leopard skin robe\n\n10,000 Maniacs joke accompanied with contemporary band photo (with lead singer Mary Ramsey) rather than Natalie Merchant. This leads Seth to ask the Graphics Department to consult him if a band used in a joke has had a line-up change. Ex. “Don’t assume Phil Collins, I might want Peter Gabriel.”\n\nAngry Grandpa at a Lowes. Issue: The aisles are labeled 61, 62, and 17. Jackals take notice. Seth thinks it might be Q-related.\n\nSeth catches on to the phenomena of Cross-jackal Discourse.\n\nSeth congratulates his underling, Colin Jost, for breaking his record as longest running Weekend Update Host. He qualifies this, reminding everyone that (1) unlike “fat cat” Jost, he has an everyday job, and (2) Jost and Che have it easy because for four of the years they’ve hosted “the jokes just wrote themselves”.\n\nSeth confirms that the jokes just wrote themselves at LNSM too. “We would just come back, and they’d be there.”. He compares the experience to “The Shoemaker and the Elves” except with 30 Rock’s Shoemaker (MTS). MTS forced elves to write Trump-era jokes by threatening physical violence or death, every night, for four years. MTS claims Seth’s attempts to police his managerial style are cancel culture.\n\nScollins Joke: (The Joke: Amid global-supply chain delays toy makers are reportedly planning to release more small-squishy toys this holiday season. “You mean rabbits?” asked Lenny.) Seth apologizes for saying Mice and Men instead of Of Mice and Men, then addresses a sophomore English teacher who explains why the joke doesn’t work (Lenny dreamed of rabbits but only killed a puppy and Curly’s wife). He says, “There’s nothing novel about finding why a Scollins joke doesn’t work.” Seth is however, surprised to find that Curly’s wife doesn’t have a name. He comes to the conclusion that Steinbeck was just really bad at coming up with names…followed by an imagined conversation between Steinbeck and his editor that ends with Steinbeck running to the window and yelling “Dolores”. It’s a Seinfeld joke. There was a graphic.\n\nBaby Hitler Graphic/Crossjackal Discourse: Hitler had brown eyes vs. blue eyes\n\nLaugh track Discourse: “They think it’s a laugh track because they can’t believe you get actual humans to laugh” -Mean (but funny) Jackal\n\n**Boston accent** “Ask Scollins why his town doesn’t have a decent hotel?” -Another mean (specific) commenter\n\nIn regards to the hat he debuted the previous week, many Jackals point out that all hats are double sided, a one sided hat is a picture of a hat. Very meta\n\nTara from the Graphics Department is the underling to whom Seth dictates his mug visions every week. The mugs are featured on a @seacaptainpolls poll.\n\nSeth teases that Jackal merch is available at: wwwW.latenightmerch\\jackal\n\n**In a suit** “For Weekend Update, I’m Seth Meyers”\n\nWeek of 11/1 Message: n/a [Run Time 16:43] Mug: Same as 10/25*\n\nPronunciation errors\n\nNew Hampshire vs. Vermont: Seth clarifies that since New Hampshire joined the union three years before Vermont, Vermont is the upside down New Hampshire.\n\nHouse-boat vs. Yacht: Seth said House-boats don’t have cursive on the back. Jackals pointed out that the writing was in script, not cursive as the letters don’t connect. Jackals go easy on him as they do not teach cursive in school anymore. “Ya,” Seth says, “and when they do teach kids cursive, it’s only to write mean things about white people…Cursive Race Training.”.\n\nGraphics Department\n\nGrandpa at Lowes: In regards to accusations that Seth is part of the liberal elite that doesn’t go to home repair stores, he says “yeah”.\n\nBaby Hitler: Brown eyes vs. blue eyes discourse continues, but one brave Jackal noted that babies can’t grow mustaches.\n\nBible jokes continue…no mention of a philistine or Phillis Stein\n\nComic book fans mad that Mike Lindell was in Joker makeup (a la Joaquin Phoenix) saying “Why so serious?!” (a la Heath Ledger).\n\nO. Henry (Week 4): Regarding the unaired Muppets Christmas Special (1978), Seth proves that Gonzo does in fact have a penis, in regards to claims that Gonzo is genderless.\n\nJets diss, because they can’t be good. “That, and White Lotus. What a year!”\n\nThe jokes just write themselves CLARITY STATEMENT: When someone would ask who writes Seth’s jokes he’d respond, “Them-s elves.”.\n\nThe Elves and The Shoe: Seth thinks it’s weird that at some point MTS, himself, toiled under his own Shoemaker. He continues the thought noting that MTS is of German and Italian descent so it makes sense that “everyday [he] feels like [he’s] fighting World War II!”.\n\nJackals question MTS’ ability to throw elves out the window because at 30 Rock, the windows don’t open all the way anymore. Seth clarifies that MTS makes it work. The windows open a little and he just “muscles” them through.\n\nAnatomical Correctness: Rat abs edition\n\n10,000 Maniacs corrections combined with Baze dis.\n\nSteinbeck: The classic American author wrote a lot of serious stuff. However, under a pen name, he wrote a werewolf murder mystery called Murder at Full Moon. Seth claims that unfortunatley Steinbeck’s manager was dismissive of fun content. He then asks Jackals if he should give Travels with Charlie another try.\n\nSeth addresses corrections to the Halloween mugs. (1) The Jackal-Antern should be light inside. Seth said it is purposefully unlit as “Jackals have no light inside them.”. (2) The Jackal-Intern is actually a cartoon hyena. Seth said although Tara is good at her job, she is mean. When Seth approached her about the Jackal-erasure she told him to show the other side of the mug. It reads, “You’re Losers”.\n\n“See me next week”\n\nWeek of 11/8 Message: “No. She was gladiator.” [Run Time 13:27] Mug: “Jackal Pun TBD”\n\nMuppet Anatomical Correctness: Big Bird edition. Oscar the Grouch also did not get the Hep C vaccine, as it does not exist.\n\nSeth’s Celebrity Tangent: Seth met the original Big Bird, Caroll Spinney, at SNL. He could not read cue cards from in the costume so he held a pen light in his mouth and read lines off a tiny clip board he was holding. Eric Edward said “i"
