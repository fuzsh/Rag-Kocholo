        "text": "Course Descriptions 2021-2022\n\nCourse Categories:\n\nCourses Primarily for Undergraduates\n\nCourses Primarily for Graduate Students\n\nCourses Primarily for Undergraduates\n\nEnglish 210-1 – English Literary Traditions, Part 1\n\nCourse Description: This class surveys major texts in the development of English literature from the epic Beowulf (c. 700) to Olaudah Equiano’s Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African (1788). A central goal of the class is to develop tools for approaching literary texts as creative expressions as well as challenging reflections on society, power, knowledge, and difference. The millennium-long sweep of English 210 will help us appreciate literature not as leisure reading but as challenging, bold, funny, even utopian political thought articulated through new representational forms.\n\nThe class is structured in units with key texts accompanied by corollary short documents aimed to illuminate the text’s historical and literary meanings. Central readings (some excerpted) include: Beowulf; Geoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales; Thomas More, Utopia; William Shakespeare, The Tempest and sonnets; John Donne, Andrew Marvell, poems; John Milton, Paradise Lost; Aphra Behn, Oroonoko; Eliza Haywood, Fantomina; Jonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels; Olaudah Equiano, Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African.\n\nEnglish 211 – Introduction to Poetry\n\nCourse Description: The experience of poetry can be understood in it at least two radically different ways: as a raw encounter with something unfamiliar or as a methodically constructed mode of access to the unknown. Theories of poetry from antiquity to the present day have grappled with these two dimensions of the poetic experience. In order to understand a poem, a reader must, in some sense, enter into its unique and complex logic, while nevertheless remaining open to the sometimes unsettling ways it can surprise us. In this class, we will read some of the greatest lyric poems written in English, as we systematically develop an understanding of the formal techniques of poetic composition, including diction, syntax, image, trope, and rhythm. Students should come prepared to encounter poems as new and unfamiliar terrain (even if you've read a particular poem before), as we methodically work through the formal elements of the poetic process.\n\nTeaching Method: Lectures and required weekly discussion sections.\n\nEvaluation Method: Weekly (w)reading exercises; one 5-7 page paper; final project; final exam.\n\nRequired Texts: Course packet available at Quartet Copies and on Canvas.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Comp Lit 211.\n\nEnglish 273 – Introduction to 20th Century American Literature (TTC)\n\nCourse Description: After asserting its “manifest destiny” in the nineteenth century, the United States became an unprecedented global power in the twentieth century, especially after World War II. In 1941, the publisher Henry Luce went so far as to coin the phrase “the American century” to describe the new role of the emerging superpower in world affairs. For some, the US became the “indispensable nation,” “world leader,” and an exceptional international figure. For many others, such as the people of the Philippines or Vietnam or Iraq, it became a cruel and coercive imperial force. This course studies how the historical fact of US empire influenced literature and expressive culture. We will examine how both domestic and international writers most impacted by imperial violence—such as Filipino migrant laborers, the descendants of interned Japanese-Americans, or Afghani and Pakistani diaspora in the US—contest the language of empire that the U.S. used to define itself. What kinds of stories, prison memoirs, protest poems, graphic novels, and other aesthetic forms have emerged out of the desire for more truthful counter-narratives? How has the geography of United States empire shaped and informed the multiracial experience of both its populations and those abroad?\n\nWhile the course thinks through Asian American and postcolonial diaspora in South Asia and the so-called Middle East, it also encourages students to think about US imperial effects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to and learn to grapple with complex theoretical and historical concepts like settler colonialism, Cold War militarism, post-9/11 counterinsurgency, extraterritorial internment, and neoliberal hegemony. Along the way, we will ask large questions about the function of literature such as: what makes a work of art political? What kinds of aesthetic strategies do writers and artists use in their presentation of the political? What does it mean for literature to be performing resistance? Assignments will include one close-reading paper, one theoretical reading paper, pop quizzes, robust sections participation, and a final exam.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nCarlos Bulosan, America Is In The Heart (Political Novel)\n\nMiné Okubo, Citizen 13666 (Graphic Memoir)\n\nSinaan Antoon, The Corpse Washer (Contemporary Novel)\n\nMohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist (Contemporary Novel)\n\nLing Ma, Severance (Science Fictional Novel)\n\nJerome Tubiana and Alexandre Franc, Guantánamo Kid (Graphic Biography)\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Ideas of Justice\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce you to literary studies with a focus on ideas of justice. Library works will include the classical tradition, the biblical tradition, and Shakespeare who inherited both and reworked them in the early modern period. The trial of Socrates, the trial of Jesus, biblical prophecy, tragedy in Shakespeare, and modern works by Melville, Kafka, and the play, “Inherit the Wind” will be included. Reading closely, we will heed how literature offers elaborations and complications of theories of justice, as they shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will also put literature in dialogue with strands of political thought, showing how literature both reflects and shapes ideas of justice.\n\nTeaching method: Seminar\n\nNotes: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Autobiography from Augustine to Equiano (400-1800)\n\nCourse Description: The art of life-writing enjoys perennial popularity, yet its conventions have changed dramatically over time. In this class we will look at a range of premodern ideas about what constitutes the self and reasons for writing about oneself. We will begin and end with two African writers: St. Augustine’s Confessions (5th c.) and the Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano, who purchased his freedom from slavery in 1766 to become a leading abolitionist and memoirist. Other texts will include Peter Abelard’s History of My Calamities (1132), an account of his turbulent academic career and disastrous affair with Heloise; Dante’s Vita Nuova (1294), a sustained interpretation of his own love lyrics to Beatrice; the Book of Margery Kempe (1438), a maverick English holy woman and mother of fourteen; the Memoirs of Glückel of Hameln, a 17th-century German Jewish businesswoman; and the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. We will explore such questions as gender and genre, religion, authenticity, self-fashioning, and the nature of textual authority.\n\nTeaching Method: Discussion, student presentations and responses.\n\nEvaluation Method: Class discussion; three short papers (5-7 pp.); 10-minute oral presentation.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Southern Food, Music, & Literature\n\nCourse Description: “The South got something to say,” André 3000 declared at the 1995 Source Awards in New York City when OutKast won the best new rap group category, changing the course of hip hop. From Beyoncé to Lynyrd Skynyrd, soul food to new south cuisine, Flannery O’Connor to Natasha Trethewey, this course looks at the ways cultural production from the second half of the twentieth century to today has sought both to cling to a nostalgic sense of Southernness and to challenge that notion, imagining the region anew and (re)claiming it in the process. The course engages culturally diverse, multi-media and multi-genre texts about the U.S. South. We will read poems, short stories, Kiese Laymon’s novel Long Division (2013), recipes, blog posts, and music videos through the theoretical lenses of sociology, black feminism, ecocriticism, and food studies, exploring different methodological approaches to the study of literature and popular culture.\n\nTeaching Methods: Seminar discussion, collaborative group work.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, short papers, in-class presentation, paper proposal oriented around a chosen theoretical framework.\n\nTexts include: Flannery O’Connor, “Everything That Rises Must Converge” (1965); Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, Vibration Cooking or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl (1970); Natasha Trethewey, selected poems from Native Guard (2006); Kiese Laymon, Long Division (2013); Beyoncé, Lemonade (2016).\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris Bookstore and on Canvas.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 309 – Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of Obsession\n\nCourse Description: Much of writing is made up of obsessions. We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer’s life, said it simply: “You have to be obsessed. It’s not something you’d want to be—it’s rather something you couldn’t help but be.” In this course we’ll explore “obsession” from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we’ll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to—from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind’s eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we’ll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.\n\nStudents will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story. This class is for serious writers who are unafraid of taking real risks, unafraid of true rewrites/revisions, unafraid of working hard toward turning a good story or an essay into a great one.\n\nTeaching Method: Workshop.\n\nEvaluation Method: Creative writing assignments, peer-reviews, and reading responses, workshop participation.\n\nText Include: Coursepack and books.\n\nCoursepack will be available at: Quartet Copies\n\nInstructor Bio: Nami Mun was raised in Seoul, South Korea and Bronx, New York. She is the author of the novel Miles from Nowhere, which received a Whiting Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Chicago Public Library’s 21st Century Award, a Hopwood Award, and was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for New Writers and the Asian American Literary Award. Some of Nami’s honors include fellowships from University of Michigan, Northwestern University, The MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Bread Loaf and Tin House. Miles from Nowhere went on to become a national bestseller. Nami’s work can be found in Granta, Tin House, The New York Times Sunday Book Review, The Iowa Review, the Pushcart Prize Anthology, and Tales of Two Americas: Stories of Inequality in a Divided Nation, among others. Previously, she has worked as an Avon Lady, a street vendor, a photojournalist, a waitress, an activities coordinator for a nursing home, and a criminal defense investigator.\n\nEnglish 312 – Studies in Drama: State of the Nation Plays (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: In post-1945 British theatre, successive generations of playwrights have written \"state of the nation\" plays to register national preoccupations and political realities. Essentially litmus tests of social feeling, these plays reflect on the slow dismantling of empire, demographic shifts, strained or nascent institutions, and political regime change in brilliant exposés of national character. More recently, this genre has also been used to register the project of cultural pluralism (and its discontents) and Britain's place in the world. Because the plays are staged, they provide outstanding ways to examine narrative and metaphor's reception in a constantly changing political landscape.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): close reading assignments (including final paper) and participation.\n\nTexts include: Priestley, The Linden Tree; Osborne, Look Back in Anger; Wesker, The Kitchen; Behan, The Hostage; Beyond the Fringe; Storey, The Contractor; Edgar, Destiny; Brenton, The Romans in Britain; Churchill, Top Girls; Pinter, Party Time; Agbeje, Gone too Far!; Bartlett, King Charles III; Hickson, Oil; Kalnejais, This Beautiful Future.\n\nTexts will be available at: Canvas.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Theatre 340.\n\nEnglish 312 – Studies in Drama: Katherine Dunham (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This seminar explores the life and work of Katherine Dunham, an African-American dancer, choreographer, anthropologist, writer, and political activist. Dunham came of age in the milieu of the Chicago Renaissance, collaborating with Black and white artists to create a new style of dancing based on her ethnographic research in the Caribbean. During the years surrounding World War II she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization. In 1965 Dunham settled in East St. Louis, where she trailblazed methods for using the arts to engage and uplift youth in the community. The class time will be split between movement and discussion. In addition to guest teachers in Dunham technique, students in this course will encounter the full range of primary sources for dance studies—film and video, oral history and memoir, unpublished manuscripts and correspondence, exhibitions of visual material, digital databases. There will also be several co-curricular outings integrated into this course—from an exhibit at the Newberry Library to a panel at the Modernist Studies Association. Previous dance training is not required, as long as students have a passion for this inquiry into embodiment and cultural history!\n\nCourse costs: Joanna Dee Das, Katherine Dunham; Dance and the African Diaspora (Oxford University Press, 2017) hardcover ($35) or ebook ($15) ISBN: 9780190264871, and KAISO! Writings by and about Katherine Dunham, eds. Veve Clark and Sara Johnson (University of Wisconsin Press, 2005) ppbk $30 ISBN: 978-0299212742.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Dance 335.\n\nEnglish 324 – Studies in Medieval Literature: The Global Middle Ages (Pre 1830/TTC/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: The global turn in medieval studies affords new opportunities to go beyond the field’s traditional focus on Europe to explore its ties with the rest of the known world. This course will have three units. In the first, we will consider court ladies as authors of romance, comparing the fashionable Lais of Marie de France (12th century) with excerpts from the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (11th century). The second unit will focus on travel literature. We’ll read the Itinerary of William of Rubruck (ca. 1250), one of the first Europeans to visit the court of the Great Khan in the Mongol Empire, along with the best-selling Travels of Sir John Mandeville (1360s), an armchair traveler whose open-minded curiosity makes him a model of premodern ethnography. Finally, we will explore the versatile genre of the framed story collection, reading portions of the Thousand and One Nights, Boccaccio’s Decameron, and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.\n\nTeaching method: Discussion, some lectures.\n\nEvaluation method: Class discussion, three papers; one may be a creative project.\n\nEnglish 335 – Milton (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: We will study John Milton’s poetry and prose in context, with sustained attention to the complexities of his art, the crisis of his times, the subtlety of his thought, and the extent of his influence. Milton’s defenses of political, personal, and religious liberty, his self-presentation, and his grappling with key ethical questions involving free will, gender definitions, crime, authority, rebellion and redemption will be among the many concerns that arise as we explore his work in the context of the raging political and theological controversies of his time.\n\nTeaching Method: Class discussion and lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method: Papers, class presentation, class participation.\n\nTexts Include: Paradise Lost by John Milton.\n\nEnglish 339 – Special Topics in Shakespeare: Shakespeare and Others (Pre 1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: While many of them are set among courts and kings, Shakespeare’s plays repeatedly explore experiences and perspectives of those outside prevailing circles of power and social acceptance of his time: the poor, women, the young and the old, members of non-dominant racial and religious communities. Shakespeare himself fell into some of these categories of “otherness”; as actors without fixed social status, so did his colleagues; so for that matter did his Queen. Subsequent readers and interpreters of Shakespeare have found in his representations of other identities much to praise and much to question, but they have found common material to think with. Given Shakespeare’s unique status within anglophone and world literatures, Shakespeare’s writings are rich ground for posing questions of otherness, identity, and empathy, belonging, commonness, and difference. In this class we will take up some of the cues Shakespeare’s plays provide, their insights and oversights, and investigate how Shakespeare, and others, responded to them.\n\nTeaching Method(s): discussion; small group work; lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): papers and other writing projects; discussion.\n\nTexts include: parts of Sir Thomas More, Comedy of Errors, Titus Andronicus, Merchant of Venice, Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, King Lear.\n\nEnglish 344 – Studies in 18th Century Fiction: Jane Austen and the Culture Wars: Novels of Jane Austen in the Context of the French Revolution (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: The enduring appeal of Jane Austen’s novels is due in part to the fact that the historical and cultural debates in which she intervened are very much the same ones that confront us today: tradition v innovation, parental authority v filial obligation, customary social bonds v contractual relations, emotion v reason, the role of women in society, the value of the arts. This class will consider Jane Austen’s development as a writer, in the context of the “culture wars” in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. Is Austen a radical or conservative novelist? Does she defend the values of a dying aristocracy, or champion a new middle class sensibility? How does she respond to the jarring changes affecting her society? Does she assert the privileges of the governing classes or urge the rights of silenced groups (especially young women)? Does she offer a traditional or progressive view of marriage? Should children make their own choices in marriage or defer to parental authority? How do her novels cultivate good judgment? Do the arts have a progressive role in transforming society or a conservative one in maintaining traditional values? These are some of the questions we will examine as we read a range of her novels. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen’s thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Seminar, Discussion, Lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Participation, Midterm Paper, Final Paper.\n\nTexts include:\n\nMary Wollstonecraft, Vindication of the Rights of Woman (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 019955546X; ISBN-13: 978-0199555468)\n\nEdmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (Penguin ---- ISBN-10: 0140432043; ISBN-13: 978-0140432046)\n\nJane Austen, Northanger Abbey (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 019953554X; ISBN-13: 978-0199535545)\n\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (Norton Critical Edition ---- ISBN-10: 0393264882; ISBN-13: 978-0393264883)\n\nJane Austen, Mansfield Park (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 0199535531; ISBN-13: 978-0199535538)\n\nJane Austen, Persuasion (Oxford World Classics ---- ISBN-10: 0199535558; ISBN-13: 978-0199535552)\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris.\n\nEnglish 357 – Studies in 19th Century Fiction: British Children's Fantasy (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: It is said that the Victorians invented the idea of childhood: an idyllic state of wonder, play, imagination, and innocence. The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children’s novels befriend animals, outsmart pirates, soar through the London sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers today? This course will explore key works of the Victorian literature canon to consider how these various narratives reflect rapidly transforming conceptions of childhood during the nineteenth century. From Lewis Carroll’s playfully puzzling Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to Rudyard Kipling’s novel of colonial espionage, Kim, Victorian children’s novels offer a unique perspective on a world in the grip of profound political, economic, and religious change. As we read, we will also reflect on the categories of the human and the animal, the nature of child sexuality, the distinctions drawn between innocence and maturity, as well as differences in gender, race, class, and disability. How does the constructed representation of “the child” speak to the desires, ambitions, and anxieties of a given historical moment? And what does the very category of children’s literature suggest about literature’s purpose and value?\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Class presentation, short writing exercises building to final paper/project .\n\nTexts Include: Charles Kingsley, The Water-Babies (1863); Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glass (1865/1871); George MacDonald, At the Back of the North Wind (1871); Robert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island (1883); Rudyard Kipling, Kim (1901); Edith Nesbit, The Story of the Amulet (1906); J. M. Barrie, Peter and Wendy (1911); Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Secret Garden (1911).\n\nAvailable at: Norris; additional readings online available through Canvas.\n\nEnglish 366 – Studies in African American Literature: Gender and Black Masculinity (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: This course will take as its focus not only discussing black men but, more rigorously, interrogating gender as a racialized regime and masculinity itself as a subtle form of violence. Students will be invited to think about race and gender as co-constitutive (rather than simply and innocently intersectional), and about what might be possible after the interrogation?and possibly dismantling?of masculinity even when affixed to blackness. To examine these topics, we will explore the writing of Richard Wright and Percival Everett, documentaries on manhood, black feminist critiques of masculinity, and transgender perspectives on gender.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with AF AM ST 334.\n\nEnglish 368 – Studies in 20th Century Literature: Imaginary Homelands: Intro to South Asian Lit in English (Post-1830/TTC)\n\nCourse Description: South Asian writers win prizes. Ever since Salman Rushdie catapulted to international fame with the Booker Prize in 1981, writers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have become the mainstay of not only literary prize cultures and the festival circuit but also U.S. university campuses. What has made South Asian literature so popular, especially when it deals with somber questions of anticolonial resistance, postcolonial nation-building, violence, and loss? This course will introduce students to twentieth and twenty-first century South Asian Literatures in English characterized by exciting stylistic innovations in magical realism, modernist language games, lyrical prose, and biting satire. By examining novels, short stories, poems, political writing, and films, we will ask, how has literature shaped both the promise and failure of the postcolonial nation-state? What might South Asian writing teach us about the global project of democratic world-making? Topics of discussion will include gender, caste, empire, globalization, migrancy, and environmentalism.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nMulk Raj Anand, Untouchable\n\nSalman Rushdie, Midnight’s Children\n\nArundhati Roy, The God of Small Things\n\nMohammed Hanif, A Case of Exploding Mangoes\n\nNote: This course is colisted with ASIAN AM 376.\n\nEnglish 378 – Studies in American Literature: The Jazz Age: Love and Art in the 1920s (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: In “Echoes of the Jazz Age,” F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that “it was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire. “ During the cultural crisis of Modernism, when a variety of intellectual revolutions and the unprecedented carnage of the Great War suggested that Western civilization was either a sham or doomed, writers and other artists created new literary forms. Their aesthetic innovation often depicted art and love (or sex) as parallel (or contradictory) ways to create meaning the wasteland of Modernity. In this class, we will read and discuss canonical, lesser-known, and popular texts of ‘20s in order to explore how these revolutionary writers saw love and art in their own time and, maybe, in the future.\n\nTeaching Method: Lecture & Discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Participation in class discussion; short one-page responses to each text; plus a variety of options for critical papers, ranging from several short argumentative essays to one long research paper.\n\nTexts include: Eliot’s The Waste Land, Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises and In Our Time, Boyle’s Plagued by the Nightingale and The First Lover and Other Stories, Fauset’s Plum Bun, and Dos Passo’s Manhattan Transfer, as well as Herriman’s Krazy Kat and Walt Disney’s Mickey Mouse.\n\nEnglish 381 – Literature and Medicine: Intro to Disability Studies in Literature (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: The field of disability studies grew out of the rights-based activism that led, in the United States, to the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Yet, as disability theorists have observed, “western” literature has long been obsessed with disability as metaphor, character trait, and plot device. This course will serve as an introduction to the application of disability studies in literature. We will explore a range of questions: how do we approach the representation of disability in texts by non-disabled authors? How do we differentiate (or should we?) between disability and chronic illness, or between physical and mental disabilities? Can literary representation operate as activism? How do we parse the gap between disability as metaphor and lived experience? What does literature offer disability studies, and why should disability studies be a core method for studying literature? This is a methods class, and readings will be divided between theoretical texts and primary sources. Students will learn to grapple with complex sociocultural and literary analysis, as well as to make space for their own primary source readings.\n\nTeaching Methods: Discussion, collaborative reading.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, short writing exercises.\n\nTexts Include: Excerpts from early sources including Sarah Scott’s Millennium Hall (1760) and Henry Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling (1771). In addition, we will read from the theoretical work of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, Therí Alyce Pickens, Robert McRuer, Alison Kafer, and Jasbir Puar, and a selection of contemporary writing on illness and disability, including authors like Audre Lorde, Eula Biss, and Esmé Weijun Wang.\n\nTexts Will Be Available At: All texts will be available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 385 – Topics in Combined Studies: Civil Rights to BLM: Protest Music and Literature (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: Marked by ongoing racial disparities and police violence in the midst of a global health crisis, the past couple of years in the U.S. have seen a resurgence of mass protest as a rite of citizenship, with participants using new means of connecting and organizing as well as those that date back to the 1960s Civil Rights movement. How do we define protest literature, what is the relationship between art and politics, and what can we learn from the longer history of artistic movements tied to protest? From foundational essays by James Baldwin and Martin Luther King, Jr. to Jesmyn Ward’s lyrical exploration of mass incarceration in her novel Sing, Unburied, Sing and Ling Ma’s novel Severance, a scathing critique of capitalism set during a devastating pandemic, this course explores how various literary genres navigate between aesthetics and ideology and engage with social justice. Each week will join literary readings with some of the most impactful protest music ranging from anti-Vietnam folk songs to contemporary hip hop. Students will add their own suggestions to a collaborative playlist and will have the opportunity to explore songs, texts, and issues not on the syllabus in group presentations.\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures, seminar discussion, collaborative group work.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, discussion board posts, short papers, in-class presentation.\n\nTexts include James Baldwin, “Everybody’s Protest Novel” from Notes of a Native Son (1955) and The Fire Next Time (1963), Martin Luther King, Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail” from Why We Can’t Wait (1964), Tony Kushner, Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes (1992); Jesmyn Ward, Sing, Unburied, Sing: A Novel (2017); Ling Ma, Severance (2019).\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris Bookstore and on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 397 – Research Seminar: Retelling, Rewriting, and Resources: Imitation and Creativity between Literary Texts\n\nCourse Description: “Good artists copy; great artists steal,” said Steve Jobs—quoting Picasso, who may have been paraphrasing T.S. Eliot, who was reworking something Vergil said of Homer. Writing—poetry, drama, narrative—is made of other writing, and all writers mine their predecessors for material to vary and to reconfigure. Sometimes readers are meant to recognize a source to see how it has been transformed or preserved; sometimes borrowings and responses are only for the writer. Literary theft can be homage or parody or both at once. Most practically, literary imitation allows a work to include more than is given on the page. In this research-oriented course, we will explore what it means to build a literary work from other works. We will consider examples of imitative and creative reworking at the level of word, form, and plot, from the Renaissance, one of the most eager and dynamic periods of literary imitation, and beyond. Students will design further readings based on their research. We will also develop research strategies for writing a longer paper, and students will undertake a significant research project on a text of their choice that draws some of its energies from other works.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion; small group work; lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Research exercises; other research-based projects; group comment and review; seminar paper.\n\nTexts include: Assorted sonnets; versions of the Orpheus-Eurydice story (Plato, Vergil, Ovid, Rilke, Delany, Ruhl); Romeo and Juliet; West Side Story; Romeo + Juliet; Shakespeare in Love; Atwood, Possession; other texts and other retellings.\n\nEnglish 210-2 – English Literary Traditions, Part 2\n\nCourse Description: This course surveys highlights of British literature from the Romantic Poets through the Victorian writers to the radical innovations of Modernism and beyond. We'll read some famous and popular works of English literature, such as Jane Austen’s classic Pride and Prejudice, John Keats's great Odes, R. L. Stevenson’s shocking Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and T. S. Eliot’s revolutionary poem The Waste Land, in light of surrounding developments, conflicts, and debates: rising industrialization, nationalism, and imperialism; emerging media, transportation, and warfare technologies; political resistance and revolution; language, art, and translation in an ever-\"shrinking\" world. This course fulfills a gateway requirement for the English Major and a WCAS distribution requirement (Area VI).\n\nTeaching Method: Two weekly lectures and one weekly discussion section.\n\nRequirements and evaluation: Weekly Canvas reading posts compiled as midterm (15%) and final (15%), short paper (20%), final paper (30%), quizzes and class participation (20%).\n\nRequired texts, available at Norris Bookstore: The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Major Authors 10th ed., Vol. 2 ISBN 9780393603095; Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (Penguin, 2002) ISBN 9780141439518.\n\nNOTE: You must acquire the specific editions ordered for class because selections, chapters, and page numbers vary from edition to edition. A very few of the readings below are not included in these two texts; they will be posted as files in Canvas.\n\nEnglish 234 – Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to a range of Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, histories and romances. During the quarter, we will be considering these plays in their Early Modern context—cultural, political, literary and theatrical. We will focus centrally on matters of performance and of text. How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare’s various “texts”— his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience? Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examining some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, and the Tempest.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lectures with discussion; required weekly discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Attendance and section participation, short papers, a scene performance, midterm, final exam.\n\nTexts will be available at: Beck’s Bookstore. The required textbook is The Norton Shakespeare, 3rd ed. Stephen Greenblatt et al. ISBN 978-0393934991 (approximate cost $95 new; $48 used; copies of the 1st and 2nd editions may also be used).\n\nEnglish 270-1 – American Literary Traditions, Part 1\n\nCourse Description: This is part one of a two-quarter survey that covers writings produced in North America between the time Native peoples encountered Europeans for the first time and the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the first quarter we’ll explore the history of North American literature from its indigenous beginnings—including the migration by Europeans to what they imagined as a “new world”—through the crisis of slavery in the mid-1850’s. We will be centrally engaged with a set of related questions: What is American literature? Who counts as an American? Who shall be allowed to tell their stories, and on whose behalf? We embark on this literary journey at a moment of questioning the relations between the present and our “literary traditions”: various organizations are debating how to commemorate the four hundredth anniversaries of the years 1619 (the year the first ship bearing enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia) and 1620 (the year of the Plymouth settlers’ landing in what is now Massachusetts); at the same time, people are calling for the removal of monuments to Christopher Columbus and to the Confederacy. We will be reading authors that canonical literary histories have usually included—Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Frederick Douglass, and Nathaniel Hawthorne—alongside Native American authors who told stories of European encounter and African American accounts that radically contest the meanings of some of the key terms of U.S. literature, history, and culture: discovery, citizenship, representation, nation, freedom.\n\nTeaching Method: Two lectures per week, plus a required discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method: Evaluation will be based on two short (3-page) essays, in which students will perform a close reading of a literary passage from one of the texts on the syllabus; a final examination, involving short answers and essays; and active participation in section and lecture. Attendance at all sections is required.\n\nSome of the authors whose works we will read include: Mary Rowlandson, Anne Bradstreet, Christopher Columbus, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Benjamin Franklin, Phillis Wheatley, Powhatan.\n\nNote: English 270-1 is an English Literature major and minor requirement; it is also designed for non-majors and counts as an Area VI WCAS distribution requirement.\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Murder on the Bestseller List\n\nCourse Description: Recent bestsellers such as The Girl on the Train and My Sister, the Serial Killer are part of a long legacy of wildly popular murder mysteries. In the early nineteenth century, murder, madness, and illicit sexuality were often confined to remote Gothic castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the rise of sensation fiction in Britain and detective stories in the United States, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded the supposedly blissful domestic scene. Writers also started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about whose deaths were grievable. Beginning with bestselling authors Wilkie Collins and Edgar Allen Poe, this seminar follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), mid-twentieth-century thrillers by Daphne du Maurier, and gritty detective fiction by Chester B. Himes. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, the course will conclude with a survey of current chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins, Oyinkan Braithwaite, and others. Readings will be supplemented with films and prestige dramas, including the 2016 adaptation of The Girl on the Train and 2020’s The Undoing.\n\nTexts include:\n\nThe Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins (9780735219755)\n\nMy Sister, The Serial Killer, by Oyinkan Braithwaite (9780525564201)\n\nCotton Comes to Harlem, by Chester B. Himes (9780394759999)\n\nTexts will be available at Beck's.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 306 – Advanced Poetry Writing: âSite of Struggleâ: Poetry, History, and Social Justice\n\nCertain kinds of trauma visited on peoples are so deep, so cruel, that unlike money, unlike vengeance, even unlike justice, or rights, or the goodwill of others, only writers can translate such trauma and turn sorrow into meaning, sharpening the moral imagination.\n\n—Toni Morrison\n\nCourse Description: Responding to the question posed by the “A Site of Struggle” exhibition at the Block Museum—How has art been used to protest, process, mourn, and memorialize anti-black violence within the United States?—this course will focus on the reading and writing of poems that engage this difficult history. We will consider the function of poetry to document, bear witness, and to effect what Seamus Heaney called “the redress of poetry. Along with reading poems that take up the subject, we will read several essays to undergird our discussion of the ethics of representation, positionality, and what it means to write about violence and trauma. In all of this, we will focus on the craft of writing poetry—metaphor, image, musicality, voice, etc.—with a focus on ekphrasis and intertextuality which will engage students in responding both to the works of art in the exhibition and the poems we will read in the course.\n\nTeaching Methods: A mixture of workshop and discussion of assigned reading.\n\nEvaluation Methods:\n\nProcess Essay drafts/weekly poem assignments - 30%\n\nAbility to Critique/Class Participation - 20%\n\nFinal Portfolio: journal, 6-8 poems, final essay - 50%\n\n(Reading Journal - 20%)\n\n(Poems and final craft/process essay - 30%)\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Humanities in conjunction with the Block Museum.\n\nEnglish 307 – Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of the Tale\n\nCourse Description: In 207, you have learned to apply the basic building blocks of fiction—character, plot, point of view, scene and summary—to write your own stories. We learn the great bromide \"Show, don't tell!\" In this advanced course we will buck the bromide, and learn how to tell. We will brush up some of that previous knowledge, and build on that material and experience while continuing and deepening the apprenticeship to great writers, both contemporary and classic. Students will read some examples of great taless both classic and contemporary, and will write several exercises and two stories during the quarter.\n\nIn addition, good writers learn their craft through extensive critical reading. Through close study, critique, and imitation of many different kinds of writers, you can push the boundaries of your own abilities and discover new ways to create fiction. Each week, I will assign two or three stories that focus on some advanced topics in writing, including “What Makes a Tale Satisfying?”, “Using Objects in Fiction”, “Staying on the Surface”, “Villains”, “Using Jokes as a Way to Tell a Story”, and “Reading for Writers”.\n\nTeaching method: Lecture, discussion, workshop\n\nEvaluation methods:\n\nCreative Work (50%)\n\nShort Papers (30%)\n\nClass participation and attendance, including workshop (20%)\n\nReadings may include: Work by Jennifer Egan, Isak Dinesen, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, the Gilgamesh poet, Chaucer, Rebecca Curtis, Charles and Mary Lamb, Julia Elliott, and Toni Morrison, Yiyun Li, Rabindranath Tagore, and all will be made available as pdf files.\n\nEnglish 308 – Advanced Nonfiction Writing: The Video Essay\n\nCourse Description: In this course we will practice a cutting-edge form of nonfiction at the intersection of documentary, literature, experimental film and video art. We will apply literary techniques to the composition of short multimedia essays and explore the many ways in which writing with image and sound differs from writing for the page. Like its print counterpart, the video essay is an attempt to see what one thinks about something. The video essay may engage with fact, but tends to be less self-assured than documentary. Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, “wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth.” Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term cinécriture, or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script. Choosing images, designing sound—these, too, were part of that process. At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses. The goal of this course is to better understand how the act of writing is shaped and, in best cases, furthered, by visual and sonic elements. We will author our own short video essays and will, in the process, learn to record and edit video, produce layered soundscapes, and use our voices as tools of performance.\n\nTeaching Method: Students produce four multimedia sketches for this course (a soundscape, a still-image essay, a video portrait, and an object diary), write an audio/visual script, then produce a roughcut video essay or short documentary based on that script, to be followed by a complete, polished film. Readings, screenings and auditions of peer work comprise a substantial share of class sessions.\n\nTexts include: Films by Laurie Anderson, John Akomfrah, William Burroughs, Raoul Peck, Slavjov Zizek, Ross McElwee and many more, all available via NU.\n\nEnglish 324 – Studies in Medieval Literature: Pagan and Christian in Medieval Literature (Pre-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: Medieval culture was overwhelmingly Christian, but it was heir to several pre-Christian religions. Germanic paganism brought monsters, defiant heroism, and expectation of a coming “twilight of the gods,” while Celtic paganism supplied fairy temptresses, magical objects, and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources in vernacular literature. But it’s fascinating to see how medieval writers adapted and transformed the narrative materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present an overtly Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. We will read a selection of Old English, Middle English, and Old French works in translation, concentrating on Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and legends of the Holy Grail. A crucial part of the class will be to look at modern adaptations of these works, including films ranging from the comic Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) to David Lowery’s 2021 movie, The Green Knight.\n\nTexts:\n\nBeowulf, trans. Seamus Heaney (Norton Critical Edition, 2002)\n\nBeowulf, trans. Maria Dahvana Headley (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2020)\n\nMaria Dahvana Headley, The Mere Wife (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2018)\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight, trans. Marie Borroff, ed. Laura Howes (Norton Critical Edition, 2010)\n\nChrétien de Troyes, Perceval, trans. Ruth Harwood Cline (U. of Georgia Press, 1985)\n\nRobert de Boron, Merlin and the Grail, trans. Nigel Bryant (D. S. Brewer, 2001)\n\nThe Quest of the Holy Grail, trans. P. M. Matarasso (Penguin, 1969)\n\nEnglish 338 – Studies in Renaissance Literature: All Cohaerence Gone: Revolutionary Writing in Seventeenth Century England: Milton, Hutchinson, Taylor, Cavendish, Pulter (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: The seventeenth century was a time when, in the words of John Donne, new ways of thinking “call[ed] all in doubt.… ’Tis all in pieces, all cohærence gone.” It began with the crowning of a king of Scotland over England, and by mid-century his son and heir had been tried under laws and executed for crimes against the people whom he described as his subjects. It was a time that saw itself as revolutionary, which predictably in the seventeenth century meant two opposing things: a return to an imagined point of departure, and an overturning of values and expectations. Revolutionary writing across England reflected and developed these dividing tendencies in every field: politics, science, and even in new forms of writing. New voices and opinions emerged and were heard more widely than ever, those of women, working people, people on all sides of debates trying to reimagine what held them together as a community. In this class we will read a variety of writers who tried to reimagine what would come of revolution and a world that seemed to have turned upside down.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion; small group work; lecture.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Papers and shorter writing assignments; discussion.\n\nTexts include: TBD, but will likely include works by John Milton, Lucy Hutchinson, John Taylor, Gerard Winstanley, Abiezer Coppe, Margaret Cavendish, Katherine Phillips, and Hester Pulter.\n\nEnglish 338 – Studies in Renaissance Literature: Early Modern Sexualities (Pre-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This course explores the history of sex and sexualities -- in all their variety -- in English Renaissance literature and culture. Before the homo/hetero divide, before what Michel Foucault calls as \"the implantation of the perverse,\" before genders in their modern forms, what were the routes, locations, effects, and politics of sex and desire? To what extent can we discuss \"sexuality\" in relation to \"identity\" in the pre-modern era? To address these complex questions, and to begin to ask new ones, we will concentrate on a range of exemplary literary and historical texts from around 1600 in England. We will be interested to explore both the multiple forms and functions of desire, eroticism, sex, asexuality, gender, gender-identification, etc. in this culture, as well as the terms, methods, and theories we now use to read the sexual past. We will gain fluency in the seemingly familiar but simultaneously foreign languages of early modern identities and desires: sodomy, tribadism, friendship, marriage; bodies, their parts, and their pleasures. We will interrogate sex/gender's intersections with such categories as race, religion, social class, and nation, and we will think through some new scholarship on trans* identities in early modern culture.\n\nTeaching Method: Participatory seminar with some mini-lectures.\n\nEvaluation Method: Papers, preparation for seminar, participation in seminar.\n\nTexts include: (tentative list as of June 2021; some in course reader)\n\nFoucault, The History of Sexuality, vol. 1 (ISBN: 0679724699);\n\nDonne, \"Sapho to Philaenis\";\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses (sel.);\n\nMarlowe, Hero and Leander;\n\nShakespeare, Venus and Adonis;\n\nBeaumont(?), Salmacis and Hermaphroditus;\n\nMontaigne, \"Of Friendship\";\n\nShakespeare and Fletcher, The Two Noble Kinsmen (978-0671722968);\n\nMarlowe, Edward II (1472520521);\n\nShakespeare, Twelfth Night (978-074348496);\n\nMargaret Cavendish, The Convent of Pleasure;\n\nBeaumont and Fletcher, Love's Cure, or The Martial Maid;\n\nadditional historical and theoretical texts TBA.\n\nTexts available at: Beck's Books in Evanston.\n\nNote: This course is combined with Gender Studies 361. To get on the waitlist, please fill out this form.\n\nEnglish 357 – 19th Century British Fiction: Sex, Madness, and Marriage (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: The word “Victorian” exudes a certain stuffiness, a corseted and stiff-lipped repression characteristic of, and confined to, a distinct historical moment. Comparing modern sexual mores to those of the past, however, Michel Foucault notoriously deems us “other Victorians” in our erotic predilections and preoccupations, suggesting far less has changed since the nineteenth century than we might like to believe. By examining a number of nineteenth-century novels that particularly grapple with issues of desire, eroticism, and consent alongside queer and feminist scholarship, this course will investigate questions of sexual identity, desire, gender conformity, and fluidity, that remain provocative today. Melodramatic, sensational, sensual, and challenging, texts like Anne Bronte’s Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Wilkie Collins’s The Woman in White, and Olive Schreiner’s Story of an African Farm give us the opportunity to reconsider what the Victorians referred to as “the Woman Question”: a growing social conservatism in response to changing gender conventions in no way confined to a single sex. How do these narratives negotiate questions of consent and kinship in response to growing calls during the period for gender equality? And what does the Victorian novel have to tell us—“we other Victorians”—about ways of thinking about sexual difference, deviance, and desire?\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Class presentation, brief written responses, and final paper/project.\n\nTexts Include: Anne Bronte, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848); Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White (1859); Olive Schreiner, The Story of an African Farm (1883); Thomas Hardy, Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891); Henry James, The Turn of the Screw (1898).\n\nAvailable at: Norris; individual readings available through Canvas.\n\nEnglish 366 – Studies in African American Literature: Debates in African American Literature (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: What is African American literature? The answer, taken for granted by so many institutions (publishers, universities), would belie fearsome debates on the boundaries of a tradition that, these decades into the twenty-first century, remain porous. This course both examines and departs from the disciplinary function of anthology and identity, studying the question as it has been asked and answered in and against the backdrop of American literature. Possible authors: Charles W. Chesnutt, George Schuyler, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Barbara Christian, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Kenneth W. Warren, Margo N. Crawford.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with AF AM ST 380.\n\nEnglish 368 – Studies in 20th Century Literature: Virginia Woolf & Bloomsbury (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: Centered on the British Museum, the artists and intellectuals known as ‘Bloomsbury” formed, E. M. Forster claimed, \"the only genuine movement in English civilization.\" Prewar political and social movements had made some think that Europe “might really be on the brink of becoming civilised” (L. Woolf). The Great War (1914-1918) shattered millions of lives, marked “the end of a civilization,” disrupted a racialized imperialist and patriarchal social order, and challenged Europeans to rebuild their civilization “on firmer ground” (Freud). The ensuing contest between liberal democracy and rising totalitarianisms led to – and beyond – World War II. Bloomsbury’s network includes Virginia and Leonard Woolf, co-founders of the Hogarth Press (which made Woolf “the only woman in England free to write what I like”); writers Forster, T. S. Eliot, Rupert Brooke, Katherine Mansfield, Lytton Strachey, Elizabeth Bowen, Radclyffe Hall, Vita Sackville-West (who inspired Orlando), David Garnett; painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant; art critics Roger Fry and Clive Bell; philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore; composer Ethel Smyth; economist John Maynard Keynes; founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (a Hogarth author). These thinkers and artists grappled across disciplines with the challenges of a new century of rapid technological and social change.\n\nWe’ll study a selection of Virginia Woolf’s major novels and essays alongside works by contemporaries and later writers in light of key contexts: the 1910 Post-Impressionist Exhibition; the women’s movement and suffrage campaign; pacifism, world war, the Versailles peace conference; racialized British imperialism at home and abroad; the Spanish Civil War; Nazism, fascism, the early years of WWII. A visionary, influential modernist novelist and essayist, Woolf is also a theorist in the spirit of the Greek theoria: a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory; a sight, a spectacle” (OED). Her writings “look at” human beings--and human being—to capture everyday private and public life amid spectacular changes in London, England, Europe, the British Empire, the greater world, and the known and imagined cosmos.\n\nRequirements and evaluation: Attendance and participation (20%); weekly Canvas posts collected as midterm and final (20%); class presentation with 1-2 page handout (15%); option of two shorter or one longer paper/project(s) (40%); self-evaluation (5%).\n\nBooks at Norris: Woolf, Monday or Tuesday (Dover 978-0486294537); Jacob's Room (Dover 978-0486401096 or: Oxford World Classic 978-0199536580); Mrs. Dalloway (Harcourt; Mariner, ed.

Candace Ward (Dover Thrift 9780486295688).\n\nEnglish 368 – Studies in 20th Century Literature: Human Rights Redacted: Literature, Statelessness, and Internment (Post-1830/TTC)\n\nCourse Description: Over the last decade, posters announcing “Refugees Welcome Here” have appeared across US landscapes. What does the particular figure of the refugee tell us about the status of human rights in the twenty-first century? What are human rights in the contemporary period and why do we care about them? Who gets to be a human and who doesn’t? This course examines the logic behind both the dispensation and withholding of human rights through literary texts across genres (novels, short stories, and graphic novels) and political theory across global sites like Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Guantánamo, and Manus Island. The course queries the role of empathy, citizenship, the category of the human, and protection from torture, genocide, and extralegal violence in representation by studying key figures such as the refugee, the undocumented migrant, the prisoner, and the animal.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nBessie Head, Maru\n\nMichael Ondaatje, Anil’s Ghost\n\nMirza Waheed, The Collaborator\n\nSanjay Kak, Jashn-E-Azadi\n\nBehrouz Boochani, No Friend But the Mountains (trans. Omid Tofighian)\n\nJerome Tubiana and Alexander Franc, Guantanamo Kid\n\nEnglish 371 – American Novel: Black Women Writers (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This course introduces students to a variety of works by Black women writers since Phillis Wheatley. At this moment, the notion of the “Black woman writer” may not seem anomalous or unusual. However, it was only a short time ago in history that to be a Black woman writer meant to be considered an aberration. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Phillis Wheatley’s poems were “beneath the dignity of criticism.” Henry Louis Gates, Jr., suggested that Jefferson and a panel of white men held an official trial to interrogate the authenticity of Wheatley’s work. These men would have never imagined that conference sessions, entire books, and countless critical articles would be dedicated to this foundational black woman writer: the very first black author to see their work published in the United States. We mark the beginning of Black published letters in the US with Wheatley; and it is within this tradition that we will consider the similarities and differences in content and forms by the women writers that we will read during this course.\n\nIn this class, we will survey a wide range of Anglophone Black Diaspora women authors and primarily concentrate on the United States. Our authors will include Toni Morrison and Phillis Wheatley, as well as Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Octavia Butler, and others. We will read poetry, short stories, essays, and at least one novel by these and other authors. We will also read secondary critical works about the central literature and work together as a class towards our own literary criticisms.\n\nAssignments will include at least regular online discussions, a group presentation, and an individual final project. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation. This seminar depends on discussion and participation of every member of the class.\n\nNote: This course is colisted with AF AM ST 379.\n\nEnglish 372 – American Poetry: U.S. Poetry: From the Revolution to the Civil War (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: American poetry has frequently been reduced to the study of two poets--Whitman and Dickinson--who stand apart from the rest by virtue of their eccentricity and extraordinary ambition. This selective account of poetic inheritance has produced the unusual circumstance of a canon that needs to be opened not only to culturally marginal but also to culturally dominant poets and poetic forms. This course integrates the study of Whitman and Dickinson with the study of a vastly expanded canon of American poetry, including poets who were vastly better-known than either of them. The course also reads theoretical and critical texts that raise questions about canonization and the formation of literary-historical narratives.\n\nTeaching Method: Mostly discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Mandatory attendance and active, informed participation. Two papers, one shorter and one longer. Final exam.\n\nPoets may include: Joel Barlow, Phillis Wheatley, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, John Greenleaf Whittier, Lydia Huntley Sigourney, William Cullen Bryant, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, William Wordsworth, Edgar Allan Poe, Sarah Helen Whitman, Sarah Margaret Fuller.\n\nEnglish 381 – Studies in Literature & Medicine: Illness and Femininity: Fictions and Facts (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: Ill women are scattered across the pages of literature, from swooning ladies in sentimental novels to cancer patients in popular fiction. Illness acts as narrative momentum, as a metaphor for social “ills,” and as a signifier of tragic virtue in an individual character. From the 19th century to the present, this class will examine how the tropes of illness in popular literature pertains to our broader cultural assumptions about illness and gender. How do traits associated with femininity resemble literary representations of illness, and vice-versa? How have these associations changed over time? How has the construction of ill femininity been bound up in whiteness, and how has this contributed to systemic and medical racism? What is the relationship between the representation of ill femininity and contemporary “wellness culture”? How might we locate or analyze femininity in representations of ill men? What about mental illness? Our readings will be split between popular representations of illness in novels and writings by ill authors, and we will consider how literary tropes are or are not reappropriated by the latter.\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures, seminar discussion, collaborative group exercises.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, two short analytical essays, final project.\n\nReadings Include: Anonymous, The Woman of Colour (1808); Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813); Katherine Anne Porter, Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939); Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower (1993); David Chariandy, Soucouyant (2007). We will also read personal essays, poetry, portions of memoirs, or short stories by authors including Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Eula Biss, Anne Anlin Cheng, Suleika Jaouad, Audre Lorde, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Michelle Zauner.\n\nTexts will be available at: Novels will be available at the Norris bookstore; all other readings will be uploaded to Canvas as screen-reader-compatible PDFs.\n\nEnglish 385 – Topics in Combined Studies: Literary Animals from Noahâs Ark to Shakespeareâs Sheep (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse description: Before the nineteenth-century ideas of extinction and evolution, writers considered the earth’s number of species to be unchanging. How were relations across this fixed set of creaturely kinds understood, and how was the diversity of these life-forms explained? What claims did these creatures have on humans, and what might earlier understandings of their entitlements reveal about assumptions concerning “us” and “them” now? Focusing on English Renaissance literature, this course will explore the teeming possibilities for thinking across species – before a starker “the human/animal divide” took shape. We’ll map different approaches to natural history, ranging from re-readings of Genesis, to lawsuits filed against insects, to complaint poetry written in animal voices, to the night-rule of cats on the rooftops of London, to Shakespeare’s animals (in their natural habitats of forest, field, and fantasy too), and then to the explicit pursuit of “human empire” over creatures with rise of seventeenth-century science. Finally, to consider what animals might say about all this, we’ll end by analyzing a 2014 production called King Lear with Sheep (a staging of King Lear ... yes, with real sheep).\n\nEnglish 385 – Topics in Combined Studies: Anticolonial Thought (Post-1830/TTC)\n\nCourse Description: This course looks at the traditions of anticolonial thought from the late nineteenth century to the present day. Comparing movements for national liberation and literary self-determination from across the world, we’ll consider the shifting claims of the British, American, French, Spanish, and Russian empires, and the colonial subjects, postcolonial frameworks, and decolonial movements that sought to contest these formations from Chile to Alcatraz, India to Ireland, and Azerbaijan to Martinique. Our focus will most often be on the manifestos and essays in which anticolonial writers outlined their literary and political programs, but we may also look at a few poems, stories, and films.\n\nThis course will be taught in conjunction with parallel courses offered at the University of Chicago and the University of Kentucky. We anticipate building possibilities for cross-campus collaborative research among students as part of an ongoing, large-scale research collaboration.\n\nTeaching Method(s):Mini lectures, guest speakers, lively seminar discussions\n\nTexts include: TBD\n\nTexts will be available at: TBD\n\nNote: This course is colisted with Comp Lit 306.\n\nEnglish 385 – Topics in Combined Studies: Civil Rights to BLM: Protest Music and Literature (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: Marked by ongoing racial disparities and police violence in the midst of a global health crisis, the past couple of years in the U.S. have seen a resurgence of mass protest as a rite of citizenship, with participants using new means of connecting and organizing as well as those that date back to the 1960s Civil Rights movement. How do we define protest literature, what is the relationship between art and politics, and what can we learn from the longer history of artistic movements tied to protest? From foundational essays by James Baldwin and Martin Luther King, Jr. to Jesmyn Ward’s lyrical exploration of mass incarceration in her novel Sing, Unburied, Sing and Ling Ma’s novel Severance, a scathing critique of capitalism set during a devastating pandemic, this course explores how various literary genres navigate between aesthetics and ideology and engage with social justice. Each week will join literary readings with some of the most impactful protest music ranging from anti-Vietnam folk songs to contemporary hip hop. Students will add their own suggestions to a collaborative playlist and will have the opportunity to explore songs, texts, and issues not on the syllabus in group presentations.\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures, seminar discussion, collaborative group work.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Participation, discussion board posts, short papers, in-class presentation.\n\nTexts include: Tony Kushner, Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes (1992); Jesmyn Ward, Sing, Unburied, Sing: A Novel (2017); Ling Ma, Severance (2019).\n\nTexts will be available at: Norris Bookstore; all other readings will be accessible via Canvas.\n\nEnglish 386 – Studies in Literature & Film: Frankenstein's Hideous Progeny (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: When Mary Shelley released the revised edition of Frankenstein in 1831, she referred to her groundbreaking and popular novel as her “hideous progeny” which she hoped would nonetheless “prosper” in the world. She could not have imagined the extent to which Frankenstein would persist in popular culture. This class will consider the retellings, adaptations, appropriations, and parodies of Frankenstein. We will consider what aspects of Shelley’s novel have survived in the popular imagination, and what we have changed. Why did the creature turn from a well-spoken, self-educated subject into a green, non-speaking monster? What lessons have we drawn from Dr. Frankenstein’s ill-fated experiment? When and how have marginalized writers (re)claimed the creature as a figure of the oppressed? Why has Shelley’s sentimental and atmospheric gothic novel inspired so much levity and humor? From the 1931 film adaptation to Susan Stryker’s expression of trans rage in “My Words to Victor Frankenstein” (1994); from the beloved parody Young Frankenstein (1974) to Victor LaVelle’s graphic novella series Destroyer (2017-), there seems to be no bottom to the relevance of Shelley’s classic novel. This class will consider questions of authorship, originality, and novelty. In addition to reading Frankenstein and its progeny, students will learn how to analyze media on the basis of historical context and genre norms.\n\nTeaching Methods: Short lectures; discussion\n\nEvaluation Methods: Presentation, reflections, 2 short papers\n\nTexts Include: Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818); Susan Stryker, “My Words to Victor Frankenstein Above the Village of Chamounix: Performing Transgender Rage” (1994); Ahmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad (2014); Victor LaVelle, Destroyer #1 (2017); Films include Frankenstein (1931); Young Frankenstein (1974); The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975); we may also watch individual episodes of television, look at visual representations of Frankenstein’s monster in comics and illustrations, and keep a running list of Frankenstein encounters in our day-to-day lives\n\nTexts Will Be Available At: Texts will be available at the campus bookstore; films and articles will be available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 393 – Theory and Practice of Poetry\n\nCourse Description: This selective-enrollment, yearlong \"Sequence\" is designed to make students 64 Return to Calendar increasingly informed readers and self-sustaining apprentices of poetry. The Fall portion of the course begins with summer reading and intensive study in which poets learn to identify operative modes in poetry -- including description, rhetoric, story and song -- and begin connecting contemporary participants with root systems in the tradition. We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop. In the Winter term, students will continue to read and complete close reading assignments and will stretch their skills as they complete a week of \"Daily Poems,\" thereby drawing on original energy and stamina to bring their work to the next level of accomplishment. Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning. Through this intensive and nurturing Sequence, students become careful readers of each others -- work and complete a polished portfolio of original writing.\n\nTexts include:\n\nSeam, Tarfiah Faizullah\n\nEngine Empire, Cathy Park Hong\n\nOne Big Self, C. D. Wright\n\nA Wreath for Emmitt Till, Marilyn Nelson\n\nNative Guard, Natasha Tretheway\n\nWild Grasses on the River Bank, Hitomi Ito\n\nRift, Tess Taylor\n\nNote: No P/N registration. Attendance at first class mandatory. Admission by application only.\n\nEnglish 397 – Research Seminar: Realism\n\nCourse Description: What is realism? Do we even have to ask? English 397 will investigate this seemingly obvious literary mode. First, we will explore the conventional wisdom that realism emerges alongside the rise of modern science: just as experiment becomes the standard of scientific truth, so early fiction bases its claim to be truth-like on its simulation of experimental testimony. We’ll read one exemplar of experimental witnessing, the travel narrative, in both true and fictional forms: the privateer William Dampier’s A New Voyage Around the World (1697) and Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719). We will accompany these texts with short readings of scientific experiments (from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and Robert Boyle’s New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air) as well as some contemporary theories of the rise of the novel. We will then read Olaudah Equiano’s The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789), which recounts its author’s enslavement, displacement, manumission, and further voyages, to examine how Equiano redeploys the tropes of the travel narrative to argue for abolition.\n\nTurning to nineteenth-century realism and beyond, we will read Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1813) to consider its treatment of perceptual evidence, the founding premise of the realist mode. How does Austen complicate or even reject sensory self-evidence as the basis for knowledge? We will then read one classic of French realism, Honoré de Balzac’s Lost Illusions or Père Goriot (in English), alongside canonical critical takes on realism by Georg Lukács, Fredric Jameson, and Roland Barthes. In the course’s penultimate unit, we will consider the status of the real in contemporary science studies. We will examine the constructivist-realist debate in the history and sociology of science (readings by Thomas Kuhn, Ian Hacking, Steven Shapin, and Bruno Latour), whereby scientific truth may be a function of social convention. We will be attuned to claims that it is the literary aspects of science that mask the constructedness of scientific truth—claims we will be in a good position to examine. We end the quarter with two contemporary novels that challenge the capacity of realist literary convention to capture marginalized realities: Miriam Toews’s Women Talking and Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad. What, we will ask, is the literary and social currency of realism today? Has realism internalized a capacity to reflect critically on the reality that it claims faithfully to represent?\n\nAs a research seminar, this iteration of English 397 affords a range of prospective topics for a long research essay, extending from realism’s founding texts through nineteenth-century realism, science studies, and contemporary feminist and antiracist appropriations of realism. We will dedicate sustained class time to the tasks of articulating an essay topic, developing a bibliography, and structuring and drafting an argument. To further these ends and promote collective understanding, some class sessions will be organized as workshops.\n\nEnglish 213 – Introduction to Fiction\n\nCourse Description: What is fiction? What is fiction for? What is the relationship between fictional worlds and the real one? These are the questions that we will explore in this class. Reading both essential works of fiction and important theories of fiction, we will seek to understand the construction and purpose of these other literary worlds, as well as the social and political importance of reading this world otherwise.\n\nTeaching Method(s): lecture with required TA-led discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Short essay, midterm exam, final exam, quizzes and participation.\n\nTexts include: Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four; Jamaica Kincaid, A Small Place; Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein; Ahmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad.\n\nTexts will be available at: Bookends & Beginnings, 1716 Sherman Avenue.\n\nEnglish 270-2 – American Literary Traditions, Part 2\n\nCourse Description: This course is the second part of a survey of American literature covering the decade preceding the Civil War to 1900. In lectures and discussion sections, we shall explore the divergent textual voices--white and black, male and female, poor and rich, enslaved and free--that constitute important strands of the literary tradition of the United States in the nineteenth century. Central to our study will be the following questions: What does it mean to be an American in 1850, 1860, 1865, and beyond? Who speaks for the nation? How do the tragedy and the triumph of the Civil War inflect American poetry and narrative? And how do post-bellum writers represent the complexities of democracy, particularly the gains and losses of Reconstruction, the advent of and resistance to the \"New Woman,\" and the class struggle in the newly reunited nation?\n\nTeaching Method: Two lectures per week, plus a required discussion section.\n\nEvaluation Method: Evaluation will be based on two short (3-page) essays, in which students will perform a close reading of a literary passage from one of the texts on the syllabus; a final examination, involving short answers and essays; and active participation in section and lecture. Attendance at all sections is required.\n\nTexts may include: Herman Melville, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street\"; Rebecca Harding Davis, \"Life in the Iron Mills\"; Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl; Emily Dickinson, selected poems; Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself” and other selected poems; Charles Chestnut, selected tales; Kate Chopin, The Awakening.\n\nNote: English 270-2 is an English Literature major and minor requirement; it is also designed for non-majors and counts as an Area VI WCAS distribution requirement.\n\nEnglish 275 – Intro to Asian American Literature (ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: Asian American, Asian-American, Asian/American: from Chinese Americans to Hmong Americans to mixed race Asian Americans, from fourth-generation Californians to cosmopolitan college students, from desert internment camps to New York City office buildings, what do the many subjects and locations of Asian American literature tell us about the capaciousness of the category itself? This class has two goals—first, providing an overview of literature written by Asian Americans in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries and placing these texts in conversation with key concepts from Asian American culture and history. Second, interrogating the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of Asian American identity, a category that came into use only in the 1960s as a coalitional entity defined by shared histories of labor, discrimination, and national and cultural unbelonging.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Lecture, Discussion\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Regular reading responses; two short essays; one long essay; active class participation\n\nTexts (subject to change; please confirm final text list on Canvas before purchasing):\n\nDavid Henry Hwang, M. Butterfly (ISBN 978-0452272590)\n\nChang-rae Lee, Native Speaker (ISBN 978-157322531)\n\nMaxine Hong Kingston, The Woman Warrior (ISBN 978-0679721888)\n\nKaren Tei Yamashita, Tropic of Orange (ISBN 978-1566894869)\n\nTexts will be available at: Primary texts will be available at the Norris Bookstore and on reserve in the library. Other texts will be available in a course packet available at Quartet Copies.\n\nEnglish 277 – Intro to Latina/o Literature (ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to major Latina/o/x authors, genres, and movements by exploring a diverse corpus of literary texts. We will take a historical approach, examining how Latinx writers from various communities (Puerto Rican, Mexican American, Cuban American, Dominican American, Colombian American) have understood their relationship to the United States from the late nineteenth century up to the present. We will also question the category of Latinx. How do the experiences and histories of the various groups described under that label benefit from and/or resist identification as a single ethnicity? Most importantly, we will ask what poetry, memoirs, and novels have to offer as a way of understanding Latinx experiences. By the end of the quarter students will have an overview of the heterogeneous literary voices and aesthetics that constitute US Latinx literature.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar/Discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Attendance, class participation, readings, writing assignments, presentations final paper.\n\nTexts may include:\n\nVida by Patricia Engel, I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika Sánchez.\n\nTell Me How it Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions by Valeria Luiselli\n\nBodega Dreams by Ernesto Quiñonez\n\nPoetry, essays, and short stories by Urayoán Noel, Elizabeth Acevedo, Gloria Anzaldúa, Sandra María Esteves, among others.\n\nTexts will be available at Norris Bookstore and via Canvas.\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Desire, Demons, and Ghosts: Literary and Historical Possessions\n\nCourse Description: What does it mean to be possessed by a divine or demonic spirit, another person, or the past? In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for crucial questions that literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity. Beginning with classical mythology and the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of possession, including William Shakespeare’s Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley’s The Devils of Loudon (1952), the story of a famous reported demonic possession at a French convent. We will go on to study the possessions and hauntings staged in Edgar Allen Poe’s short stories and Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying what it means to be denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison’s Beloved (1987), James Baldwin’s essays, and Natasha Trethewey’s Native Guard (2008). These texts invite analysis of the dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of a narrative.\n\nThroughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on different literary genres. Students will also learn how we can interpret texts in conjunction with major schools of thought in literary criticism and theory.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 300 – Seminar in Reading & Interpretation: Polar Literatures\n\nCourse Description: Polar spaces at once delineate and defy our Anthropocenic imaginary. As climate catastrophe alters our relationship to the edges of conventional maps, the immense scale and distance of the North and South Poles have long inspired imaginations across the globe, even as they test the limits of our attention as well as our capacity for action. What do human representations of polar spaces tell us—south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic—about our relationship to space, environment, and climate? In this course, we will explore the most prominent of Polar genres, the travel narrative, to better understand how these places shape, and are shaped by, our political, aesthetic, and ethical understanding. Examining the sublime appeal of icy solitude figured in Romantic poetry and modern science fiction, working with archival materials of failed Victorian expeditions, and reading Inuit novels memorializing ways of life threatened by outside intrusions, we will consider the power of various narrative mediums and technologies to cultivate care for the distant, the invisible, and the potentially catastrophic. By investigating how our cultural conceptions of ice have evolved over time, we will come to appreciate how narrative is turned to, time and again, to render the far away nearby, as well as learn how we might more effectively take up narrative now as these climes face crisis.\n\nTeaching Method: Seminar discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method: Short writing assignments and final (group or individual) creative project.\n\nTexts Include: Tete-Michel Kpomassie, An African in Greenland; Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness; Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk, Sanaaq; Yuri Rutkheu, When the Whales Leave; Tanya Tagaq, Split Tooth; and selections by Edmund Burke, Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Ada Blackjack, Gwendolyn MacEwan, and Apsley Cherry-Gerrard.\n\nAvailable at: Norris; additional readings available through Canvas.\n\nNote: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement. First class mandatory. No P/N registration. This course does NOT fulfill the WCAS Area VI distribution requirement. This course may not be repeated for major or minor credit.\n\nEnglish 302 – The History of the English Language (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: Have you noticed that, unlike many other languages, English often has two different names for the same animal? These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the French-speaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in positions of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the Conqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became beef and pork and mutton – at least when they were served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other words associated with aristocratic life, these terms all derive from French. In this course we will investigate this and many other milestones in the history of the English language, focusing on the period from the early middle ages through the eighteenth century. We will pay particular attention to the relationships among “high” and “low” forms of language, including efforts to elevate the status of English and the dynamics of self-consciously “low” registers of language such as slang and obscenity. In addition to offering an introduction to the linguistic, literary, and social history of England, this course will help you to develop a more sensitive understanding of modern English that you can bring to other classes and to life in general.\n\nTeaching Methods: Mostly discussion, some lecture.\n\nEvaluation Methods: Midterm and final examinations, paper, short written exercises, oral presentation.\n\nTexts may include: Tore Janson, The History of Languages, ISBN 978-0-19-960429-6, plus readings and videos posted to Canvas\n\nEnglish 307 – Advanced Fiction Writing: What Happens Next? Structure, Plot, and Suspense in Short Fiction\n\nCourse Description: You can write a beautiful sentence, bust out of the gate with an enticing premise, and clairvoyantly reveal your character’s rich interior life to say something profound about the human condition---but at some point your story loses momentum and fizzles out. Answering the simple question of “What happens next?” is a powerful impulse that drives us as readers, and it should likewise, drive us as writers. Learn to grow your brilliant ideas into tense, invigorating stories. Put your beautiful sentences to work in the service of plot and character. And dive deep into a character during moments of conflict.\n\nStudents will explore structure, plot, and suspense through a variety of interdisciplinary, playful writing exercises that employ visual media and also other texts, encouraging spontaneity while adhering to constraints of form. Be prepared to write at least one full-length story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n\nTextbooks Will Include: Thrill Me by Benjamin Piercy. PDFs of short stories and excerpts from longer texts available on Canvas.\n\nEnglish 309 – Advanced Creative Writing: The Art of Obsession\n\nCourse Description: Much of writing is made up of obsessions. We might use our obsession as catalyst and fuel, something that gets us writing and, if lucky, keeps us writing. And sometimes we write about our obsession directly, hoping (perhaps futilely) to be purged free of it, once and for all. Susan Sontag, while talking about writing and the writer’s life, said it simply: “You have to be obsessed. It’s not something you’d want to be—it’s rather something you couldn’t help but be.” In this course we’ll explore “obsession” from two main angles: personally and textually. On the personal level, and as a way to get us started, we’ll discuss and identify subjects we keep returning to—from harmless infatuations to downright obsessions. Is Kendrick Lamar, Lizzo or the soundtrack from Mama Mia playing nonstop on your headphones, for example? Is there a painting you keep seeing in your mind’s eye? What exactly is your relationship with a well-made cheeseburger? What is the chronic conflict of your life? On a textual level, we’ll read stories, essays, and books that deal with obsession in one form or another, or reveal the linguistic obsessions the author held while writing them.\n\nStudents will have the option to write a creative non-fiction essay or a short story. This class is for serious writers who are unafraid of taking real risks, unafraid of true rewrites/revisions, unafraid of working hard toward turning a good story or an essay into a great one.\n\nTeaching Method: Workshop.\n\nEvaluation Method: Creative writing assignments, peer-reviews, and reading responses, workshop participation.\n\nText Include: Coursepack and books.\n\nCoursepack will be available at: Quartet Copies\n\nInstructor Bio: Nami Mun was raised in Seoul, South Korea and Bronx, New York. She is the author of the novel Miles from Nowhere, which received a Whiting Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Chicago Public Library’s 21st Century Award, a Hopwood Award, and was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for New Writers and the Asian American Literary Award. Some of Nami’s honors include fellowships from University of Michigan, Northwestern University, The MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Bread Loaf and Tin House. Miles from Nowhere went on to become a national bestseller. Nami’s work can be found in Granta, Tin House, The New York Times Sunday Book Review, The Iowa Review, the Pushcart Prize Anthology, and Tales of Two Americas: Stories of Inequality in a Divided Nation, among others. Previously, she has worked as an Avon Lady, a street vendor, a photojournalist, a waitress, an activities coordinator for a nursing home, and a criminal defense investigator.\n\nEnglish 310 – Studies in Literary Genres: Subversive Forms: Satire (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: What do Jonathan Swift’s pamphlet A Modest Proposal and Jordan Peele’s horror film Get Out have in common? This class examines the genre that Swift and Peele exploit to devastating effect: satire. We’ll devote special attention to satire’s key paradox: for those who get it (or think they do), satire signifies by not signifying what it literally says. We’ll explore the long history of satire to ponder its ethical concerns with social and political life; sexuality, sex work, and marriage; social class, corruption, and criminality; and empire and race. The class ends with contemporary film and TV, including Get Out and Black Mirror.\n\nTeaching method: Discussion.\n\nEvaluation method: Two short essays (5 pages); one medium essay (7 pages); intermittent Canvas posts; participation in class discussion.\n\nRequired texts list:\n\n[any additional readings will be available on Canvas]\n\nJane Austen, Northanger Abbey.

ISBN: 9780199536849\n\nEnglish 323-1 – Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: As we follow along the road to Canterbury, we not only hear a compendium of stories-both pious and irreverent-but we also meet a collection of characters whose diversity spans the spectrum of medieval society: a noble knight and a manly monk, a drunken miller and a virtuous priest, a dainty nun and a domineering wife, who compete with one other, trading insults as well as tales. Over the course of the quarter, we will explore the ways in which Chaucer experiments with late medieval literary genres, from chivalric romances to bawdy fabliaux, frustrating and playing upon the expectations of his audience. Against and alongside this literary context, we will consider the dramatic context of the pilgrimage itself, asking questions about how the character of an individual pilgrim, or the interaction between pilgrims, further shapes our perceptions and expectations of the tales: How is a romance different, for example, when it is told by a knight, by a social climber, or by a renegade wife? We will be reading Chaucer's poem in the original Middle English. At the end of the quarter, we will give an in-class performance of one of the tales.\n\nTeaching Method(s): Discussion and some lectures.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): class attendance and participation required; an oral presentation; several short papers; quizzes and a midterm exam.\n\nTexts include: The Canterbury Tales, ed. Jill Mann ISBN 978-0140422344 (approximate cost: $23) (The Canterbury Tales, ed. Larry D. Benson or The Riverside Chaucer, ed. Larry D. Benson are also acceptable editions).\n\nTextbooks available at: Beck’s Bookstore.\n\nEnglish 332 – Renaissance Drama (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: We will read and analyze some of the extraordinary plays written by Shakespeare's prolific contemporaries between the beginnings of the professional London theatres around 1580 to their forced closing in 1642. We will approach these plays from literary, theatrical, and book-history perspectives; please be prepared to think across these categories. We'll read: a revenge tragedy more popular in its time than Hamlet; a history play about a king and his lower-class, immigrant boyfriend; a tragicomedy and a tragedy about incestuous siblings (one a shocking rewrite of Romeo and Juliet); two very different tragedies with women at their center (one the first original play by an English woman); a marriage anti-comedy with multiple trans* resonances; and a prematurely postmodern play where the audience seizes control of the script. These plays will help us think about theatrical genres, about the conditions of writing, performance, and printing, about modes of social organization (marriage, family, sexuality, reproduction, social class, race and ethnicity, monarchy, dynasty, nation, to name a few), about periodization (\"Renaissance\" or \"early modern\"?), and about canonicity (for example, the distinction between Shakespeare and \"his contemporaries\" implied by our curriculum and in the first sentence of this course description).\n\nTeaching Methods: Mini-lectures; group analysis and discussion.\n\nEvaluation Method(s): Based on participation in discussion, weekly in-class writing, papers, and a final exam.\n\nPlays: The Spanish Tragedy (Thomas Kyd), Edward II (Christopher Marlowe), Epicoene, or The Silent Woman (Ben Jonson), The Tragedy of Mariam, Fair Queen of Jewry (Elizabeth Cary), A King and No King (Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher), The Duchess of Malfi (John Webster), ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore (John Ford), The Knight of the Burning Pestle (Beaumont et al.), together with some historical and critical essays. This reading list is not for the faint of heart.\n\nText: English Renaissance Drama, ed. David Bevington, Lars Engle, Katherine Eisaman Maus, and Eric Rasmussen (W.W. Norton). ISBN: 0-393-97655-6. [This anthology contains all but one of the plays we will read and is available new, used, and for rent.] This edition only.\n\nText available at: TBA\n\nEnglish 344 – 18th Century Fiction: Gothic Ecologies (Pre-1830)\n\nCourse Description: The birth of the Gothic novel, a genre overflowing with ruined castles, misty wastelands, and sinister forests, coincided with the Industrial Revolution—an unprecedented shift in human interactions with the environment. This course will consider the development of the Gothic genre in the eighteenth century and Romantic period as a revealing glimpse into the period’s anxieties regarding humankind’s place in the natural world, largely by way of the supernatural forces writers conjured to make sense of their fears of the changing landscape. In turn, we will consider how Gothic tropes—including the monstrous, the uncanny, and the sublime—shape current ecological discourses around the Anthropocene and climate catastrophe. By reading some of the genre’s most (in)famous writers, including Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, and Emily Bronte, we will examine how the Gothic affords a distinctly ecological perspective on questions of sexuality, nationality, xenophobia, and otherness in Britain and America--then and now--as well as a means for capturing the changing, and often uncanny, relationships between the human, the non-human, and the more-than-human.\n\nTexts may include: Horatio Walpole, The Castle of Otranto; Ann Radcliffe, The Romance of the Forest; Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey; Mary Prince, The History of Mary Prince; Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly; Edgar Allan Poe, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym; and selections by Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Nikolai Gogol.\n\nEnglish 357 – 19th Century Fiction: Madwomen in the Attic â Insanity, Gender, and Authorship in British Fiction (Post-1830)\n\nCourse Description: The climax of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre hinges on a shocking revelation that other writers have been rereading and even rewriting ever since. Brontë’s iconic Gothic tale of “madness,” and that concept’s inflection by gender, race, and nationality, has become central to our ideas about difference. Tracing the afterlives of Brontë’s confined madwoman through twentieth-century reimaginations of the trope, including Shirley Jackson’s Haunting of Hill House, Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, and recent films such as Midsommar and Hereditary, this course will examine how insanity has been seen as a category useful for regaining (and sometimes blocking) political and literary agency. Putting these texts and films in dialogue with critical responses by Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and others, we will explore the knotty question of how madness shapes our culture’s narratives about gender and authority.\n\nTextbooks will be available at: Beck's.\n\nEnglish 366 – Studies in African American Literature: Black Joy (Post-1830/ICSP)\n\nCourse Description: This course takes seriously the possibility and power of black happiness in an antiblack world.
