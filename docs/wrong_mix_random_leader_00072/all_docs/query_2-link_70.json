        "text": "When George walked into the office, it was a morning like any other. But he didn’t realize this day would be far from ordinary. Basking Ridge was the kind of place you could leave your office unlocked. But when he went to sit in his favorite red chair and check out the new Samsung Galaxy ZFlip6 and ZFold6, he knew immediately, something was wrong.\n\nThe big red chair was gone.\n\nGeorge, with the help of cutting-edge Samsung Galaxy AI and his podcast-loving cohorts, set out to solve the chair-crime of the century. To do so, they’d have to find out:\n\nWho could possibly want the red chair more than George?\n\nWhat does the mime know? And will Galaxy Live Translate speak mime?\n\nWho’s the puppet master behind this sinister seating caper?\n\nWill they find the big red chair before it’s too late?\n\nTo solve this whodunnit, just watch the video above. You know how to watch a video, don’t you? Just look for the play button and … click.\n\nTo get your own Samsung Z-series device for a steal, preorder the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6 today at Verizon. New and current customers can get $800 off a new Galaxy Z series phone with any Samsung smartphone trade-in – in any condition with Unlimited Ultimate – or select Business Unlimited plans. Got more clues to store and true crime to watch? For a limited time, get 512GB of storage for the price of 256GB when you pre-order your Galaxy Z series smartphone."
