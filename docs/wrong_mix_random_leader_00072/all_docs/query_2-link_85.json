        "text": "Web Stories are a web-based version of the popular \"Stories\" format that blend video, audio, images, animation and text to create a dynamic consumption experience. This visual format lets you explore content at your own pace by tapping through it, or swiping from one piece of content to the next.\n\nThis guide explains how to make your Web Stories eligible to appear on Google Search (including Discover).\n\nHere's an overview of how to enable Web Stories on Google:\n\nCreate the Web Story.\n\nMake sure the Web Story is valid AMP.\n\nVerify the metadata.\n\nCheck if the Web Story is indexed.\n\nFollow the Web Story Content Policies.\n\nFeature availability\n\nWeb Stories can appear as a single result on Google Search, which is available in all regions and languages where Google Search is available. Web Stories can also appear in a carousel on Google Search, which is available in the United States (in English), India (in English and Hindi), and Brazil (in Brazilian Portuguese).\n\nIn the Discover feed, Web Stories can appear as a single card where you can tap through the story. While this appearance is available in all regions and languages where Google Discover is available, it's most likely to appear in the United States, India, and Brazil.\n\nCreate the Web Story\n\nWeb Stories are web pages under the hood and must follow the same guidelines and best practices that apply to publishing regular web pages. There are two ways to get started:\n\nPick one of several Story editor tools to start creating stories without any coding involved.\n\nIf you have engineering resources, you can get started with AMP. To ensure your Web Story renders appropriately, we suggest using Chrome Developer Tools to simulate different device sizes and formats.\n\nTo ensure a smooth process, review the Best practices for creating Web Stories.\n\nMake sure the Web Story is valid AMP\n\nAfter you've developed the story, make sure the Web Story is valid AMP. A valid AMP story is one that adheres to various AMP specifications. This allows the Story to be served via the AMP cache and ensures performance and the best experience for your users. You can use the following tools ensure that your Web Story is valid AMP:\n\nWeb Stories Google Test Tool: Check that the Web Story is valid.\n\nURL Inspection Tool: Check that the Web Story is valid AMP and the Google indexing status of a URL.\n\nAMP Linter: Validate Web Stories during development via command line.\n\nVerify metadata\n\nFor your Web Stories to be eligible to appear on Google Search or Google Discover experiences, supply the necessary metadata to surface the Web Story in the preview.\n\nRefer to the full list of metadata.\n\nVerify that your Web Story preview appears correctly in the Web Stories Google Test Tool.\n\nRemember that the following fields are required on every Web Story: publisher-logo-src, poster-portrait-src, title, and publisher.\n\nCheck if the Web Story is indexed\n\nCheck to see if Google Search has indexed your Web Story. Use the URL Inspection Tool to submit individual URLs or review status using Page Indexing report or Sitemaps report. If your Web Story isn't indexed:"
