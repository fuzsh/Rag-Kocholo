An alternate history story, a space vessel with 5 aliens crash land on earth in the waning days of Theodore Roosevelt's presidency. They reveal themselves to the media in hopes that they will receive help in repairing their craft. How history is changed by the revelation of alien intelligent life is part of the crux of the novel along with their observations of our society. Its a light-hearted novel with the aliens interacting with Thomas Alva Edison,H.G.Welles,Rasputin and other turn-of-the-century personalities.\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nThis is ground zero for the serious sf reader, (well even the playful ones)It contains what are widly considered the greatest short stories from 1939-1964. Edited by Robert Silverberg. There is also a Volume 2 that comes in 2 books (Vol2 A and Vol2 B) ediited by Ben Bova that contains the greatest novellas from the same time period. Between these 3 volumes you'll get just about every essential non novel from the 1939-1964 along with brief bios on the authors and observations on the stories. I'm sure the others here would agree this is the way to go or else see the testimonials for these collections at goodreads,amazon or wikipedia\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nLast night I finished Robert Sheckley's short story collection Can You Feel Anything When I Do This?\n\nSheckley is a classic SF favorite of mine. I considered him the pre-eminent SF humourist in the 60s and early 70s\n\nafter Fredic Brown and CM Kornbluth past away. He's notable for these reasons:\n\nOne of his early stories, The 7th Victimwas made into an Italian SF movie in the mid 60s called The 10th Victim starring marcello Mastroianni and ursula Andress. This story is also most likely the basis for Battle Royale and The Hunger Games\n\nThe movie Freejack with Mick Jagger was based on his novel Immortality Inc\n\nOne of the early SF writers who broke out into mainstream publications.Many Sheckley stories appeared in Playboy Esquire etc\n\nWas fiction editor for Omni Magazine for a few years\n\nNominated multiple times for Hugos and Nebulas\n\nHe passed away in 2005. If you like satirical SF you should check out his work\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nFinished FATHERLAND by Robert Harris and I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Told from the perspective of Xavier March,a German police investigator, the body of one of the early founders of the Nazi party is found by the river. Its 1964, Germany had beaten England in WWII and rules Europe. America has won it's war against Japan but is in a nuclear stalemate with Nazi Germany. All it can do is help supply the Russian rebels who continue to fight out east in the Ural Mountains. But as the investigation continues , Inspector March begins to uncover a possible conspiracy and hidden truths about the war years.\n\nThe book is solidly plotted, a breeze to read, and the climax is riveting.And yes,even as Hitler celebrates his 75th birthday, The Beatles play in the nightclubs of Hamburg\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nThe Butterfly Kid-Chester Anderson 1967\n\nChester Anderson and his roommate Michael Kurland discover an alien plot to conquer the earth. Reality Pills are being distributed in Greenwich Village,pills which make your halucinagenic visions into reality. It all begins with a young kid,who with but a wave of his hand makes butterflies appear in many different sizes and colors.Join Chester,Michael and a ragtag group of hippies halt the blue lobsters' plans of conquest\n\nI wanted to like this book.I really did.The author,Chester Anderson writes himself as the star of the book with his real life roommate,SF author Michael (Whenabouts of Burr,Tomorrow Knights)Kurland.It takes place in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan that I know so well. But it never mentions the name of any landmarks or establishments besides Washington Sq Park.It includes the use of vidiphones but otherwise everything else including the slang is all circa 1967. In fact I never read anything that used the term teenybopper as much as this novel.\n\nIt takes its time to get its simple plot going,focusing at first on a typical day in the village, hanging around the park,smoking some joints,jammin with a pickup band,meeting friends at coffeehouse,avoiding the fuzz etc.Some of the halucinations make fun reading but otherwise the humour is kinda flat. Oh well,I thought it would elicit some nostalgic feelings. Didn't happen.You can't go back home\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nStarted on my next SF book. The Best of Harry Harrison\n\nHarry got his start in comic books as an illustrator often teaming up with Wally Wood. He had work published in EC,Avon and others in the science fiction,horror and western genres. At the same time he began submitting illustrations and prose to the SF pulps and his first fiction work was published in 1951.He also became the writer for the Flash Gordon newspaper strip. He abandoned illustration and comic books by the mid 50s .His most reknown novels include Make Room! Make Room! which is the basis for Soylant Green. I've read many years ago his Bill The Galactic Hero and The Transatlantic Tunnel Hurrah AKA Tunnel Through The Deeps.The Stainless Steel Rat and The Deathworld series are also amongst his best known fiction.He had edited dozens of anthologies and became the SFWA's 26th Grandmaster. He even graduated from my High School,Forest Hills High School.\n\nHe can be humorous or serious.Hard SF or not.A very versatile writer.He passed away August 2012\n\nI read a few of his short stories in several best-of-the-year anthologies and I'm sure i won't be disappointed with this collection"
