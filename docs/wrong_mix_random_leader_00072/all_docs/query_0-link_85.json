        "text": "“School Dance”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Quinn R., Age 14, Iowa, USA\n\nDescription: A nervous teen practices asking someone to the school dance. (any gender)\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\n(Excitedly pacing in their room, trying to stay calm, rehearsing their words…)\n\nI don’t know why I’m so nervous. It’s just asking someone to a dance—it’s not a big deal. But it’s not just someone; it’s someone I really like.\n\n(Staring at themselves in the mirror, trying to muster confidence…)\n\nOkay, here goes…”Hi, um, so, you know, um, the dance is coming up pretty soon and, uh, I was wondering if, maybe, you’d want to go with me?” No, no, that was terrible. Way too nervous. I need to be more confident. Okay. Take two. “Hello. Would you like to go to the dance with me?” No. Too robotic.\n\n(Imagining the worst-case scenario…)\n\nWhat if the answer is no? What if (he/she/they) laughs at me? (shaking off the negativity) What if everyone freaks out because I’m asking (him/her/them) to the school dance? What am I thinking? I have to stay positive. Okay. I can do this.\n\n(Practicing confidence)\n\n“Hi there. I’ve been meaning to ask you something. The dance is coming up and I was hoping you’d like to go with me.” That was pretty good. Short, sweet, to the point. No room for misunderstanding. And if (he/she/they) says yes…Oh my gosh…that would be amazing!\n\n(Takes a deep breath and summons courage…)\n\nOkay, it’s time to do this. Deep breaths. Act natural. I’ve got this. It’s just one simple question. A simple, scary question. But I can do it. Here goes nothing.\n\n(Exits with confidence)\n\n“Grow Up”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isaac T, Age 16, California, USA\n\nDescription: A kid gets called childish by their parents. Are they the childish ones?\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nYou’ll never believe it, but my parents called me childish today. ME! Childish! The nerve of some people! I mean, I’d get it if I acted like my younger siblings, throwing tantrums over practically everything, yet nothing at the same time. But really, come on. I’ve never felt so insulted in my twelve years of life! I honestly have no idea what encouraged such name-calling, but it’s totally unacceptable! If I had the power to do so, I’d throw those two parents of mine into the rubber room because something’s seriously got to be messed up in those brains of theirs to think that I’m the childish one. In fact, I’m the most mature person in my family! It’s the two of them who are the childish ones! Like, come on, you don’t see me over there talking in goofy voices and pinching the baby. And I sure as heck don’t go through the trouble of doing silly things to see if I can make the kid smile. What for? To see his gummy mouth? If I want to see gums, I can go to the senior center! Those people are always smiling at you without their dentures in. And if that stuff wasn’t enough, you also got everybody over there wanting to feed that diaper-wearin’-goofball with a spoon they call “The Choo-choo.” I don’t know about you, but I don’t find any joy in naming my eating utensils. Oh, and let’s not forget the “Tea Parties” they go to with my sister and her dolls. Not only do they sit there with a bunch of plastic-headed, button-eyed dolls, but there’s not even real tea at these tea parties! What’s up with that?! Yet there’s Dad over there pretending he needs a refill! A refill of what? Air?! You know, as time goes on, I’m slowly starting to realize that even though my parents look old – at thirty-six years of age, they’re practically antiques! They’re actually just a pair of little kids in disguise. And despite what they say, it’s really those two who need to grow up!\n\n“Racing Thoughts”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Autumn D., Age 14, Maine, USA\n\nDescription: A child talks to their disappointing father\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nThe only way I knew you was from pictures. Then you came waltzing into my life, wanting to be a part of my family. I was excited and scared to meet you. My mind and heart kept racing like a child running in a field or a dog who is nervous around new people. I gave you a chance. A chance to prove whether you would choose me over drugs. We both know how that turned out. I will never love you more than the parents I have now. I know they used to be my aunt and uncle, but I needed a home. They took me in, adopted me, and they love me more than you ever will. You might think I’m overreacting but I’m not; that was proven when you went back in the cage. You couldn’t stay away from bad people and drugs. I am almost embarrassed to know you. I remember when you said you loved me and called me your sweetheart. I gave you the first and only hug I’ll ever remember. But then you turned your back on me. And now you’re angry at Mom (your sister) because you think she stole me, but legally I am hers; and no offense, but I would choose her over you any day because she saved me. She took me in when you chose to go do other things. I am glad to be with her. I was excited to get to know you, but you blew that chance. You obviously don’t love me or think of me as your sweetheart. And that’s ok because I don’t think of you as a family member. I hope you can change your ways, and we can try again, but until then, my mind and thoughts just keep racing.\n\n“Locked in the Library”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Natalie R., Age 11, Colorado, USA\n\nDescription: An enthusiastic reader gets locked in the library at night. Is it scary?\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\n(Sitting in a secret spot in the library, reading a book with expression) “I saw blood spilling onto my clothes, soaking my shirt where Dracula had bitten me. Everything folded into darkness as the shadow faded away.” (Closing the book) That was an intense ending. I love my quiet little reading nook here in the library. It’s the perfect place to escape my loud and obnoxious family. Right here behind the bookcase in the fiction section, because…fiction rules! Well, it’s getting late, I suppose I should head home. (Crawling out from the bookcase) Looks like the coast is clear. (Looking around) Hmmm, the library is darker than usual. Hello? Is anyone here? (Realizing the library is closed) Uh oh. I really need to get out of here. Oh no, the door is locked! Hello! Anyone? Maybe a janitor is here? (Turns and stumbles over a book) “The Curse of the Singing Ghost.” Oh! I should check this out next time. (Reading from the book) “I look over and see a white shape drifting towards me.” (Looking up and letting their imagination get the best of them.) Ahhhh! I see a white shape drifting towards me!!! This is a lot scarier than books make it out to be. Get away from me! There’s nowhere left to run! These are my final moments. I will go out like a warrior, blazing as the only light in this dark, dark, world. I bravely spring toward the cursed ghost and am confronted by unchecked books on a metal cart. Great! The ghost is just a sheet and there’s nothing to be afraid of. You know, the library at night is not that different than it is during the day, just darker. I can wait this out until the morning. (Sees a spider) Ahhhh! A spider. . . let me out!!!\n\n“The Story of My Name”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Eftychia Aggelopoulou, Age 16, Athens, Greece\n\nDescription: What does your name mean to you?\n\nGenre: Dramatic/Comedic\n\nHappiness.\n\nWhat does happiness mean to you? Just take a moment and think about it.\n\nWell, for my parents, I think it was ME. They named me Eftychia. In Greek it means happiness. And even if I have a younger sister, I am the one and only Eftychia. If you ask me, I am not sure if I like it, but I am sure that it is unusual, as in my entire life, I have met only two people with the same name, and one of them is my grandma, the ORIGINAL Eftychia. When I think of my name, two things come to mind:\n\nThe color white, as it reminds me of light, something heartwarming, open-minded, full of joy, and freedom. Just imagine being five years old and celebrating your birthday with a few friends and your family; Running, playing, and shouting without caring about anything except eating as much cake as possible. I think that’s happiness.\n\nYet again, my name reminds me of the color black, because some people might seem happy, but they actually feel the exact opposite. When they withhold their troubles, they grow even darker, and heavier, and heavier, and heavier. I think that’s a superficial and cunning happiness.\n\nSo, I believe that my name brings billions of emotions and thoughts to each person. To each one of YOU, and you, and you. My name is Eftychia, and I want to ask you, what does happiness mean to you?\n\n“Little Devil”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Olivia C., Age 14, Washington State, USA\n\nDescription: A parent gives the babysitter the low down on their child who is literally, a “little devil.”\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nOh, thank goodness you’re here! We were beginning to worry that you wouldn’t come back after the last time you babysat Nathan. Come on in. We’re so glad that you are here because for some reason the last babysitter just…disappeared. And since then, no one will babysit our precious little angel. Alright, so in case you don’t remember where everything is, let me give you the low down again. TV remotes are in the cupboard under the TV. Baseball bat in the hall closet in case you encounter any intruders. Oh, and in the event that he gets a little too energetic at bedtime, sedatives are in the drawer by the sink. Umm Anyway, I think that’s it. Please help yourself to anything in the fridge. And no matter what, do not under any circumstances go near the basement. No matter what sounds you may hear, don’t touch the basement door. Nathan does have a few ”pets” down there, so he can go down and feed them. But when he does, you just stay in the living room. We are trying to teach him to be independent. Oh, and please no girls over, or boys for that matter. I don’t discriminate but please no… uhh, let’s just say no people. And please do not feed him anything from the list of items on the fridge. I think you are well aware of what happens when you feed him things that you shouldn’t. Sorry again about your arm and leg… Anyway! I believe that’s it. Have a great time. We will be at the “Thai Tanic.” That’s Thai like Thai food, if you need us. Oh and please don’t need us. We really need some time away from Nathan. Okay, thanks again. Bye Nathan. Love you! Don’t forget to feed your pets in the basement. Okay, love you!\n\n“Grendel’s Mother’s Secret”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Rowan H., Age 12, North Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: Based on the character from Beowulf, Grendel’s Mother reveals a secret to her son.\n\nGenre: Dramatic/Comedic\n\nGRENDEL!! I have been listening to you talk about the Danes for too long. It’s always, the Danes this, and the Danes that, and Mom, what if Beowulf rips off my arm? But it’s my time to talk. Every sentence you say, every word, in fact, makes me feel more and more awful. You know how the Danes are like a family, well… you and I were family too. As you know, your Dad left when you were born, but there is more to the story than that. I had a second child, a girl. Your dad named her Gemma, and he loved her so much, much more than you. But I really wanted a boy, not a girl. So I did something I have been regretting ever since. I didn’t want her…so I gave her to the Danes disguised as you. I knew that when they found out, Beowulf would protect the Danes, and he would kill her. I’m sorry, I now know how much you have wanted a sibling, so I decided to tell you the truth. Can you ever forgive me? I was so upset at the time and didn’t really think things through. No, Grendel! Please, don’t leave. I know you’re angry, but I apologize, please, please forgive me. Who will care for me when I get old, and what if…you know what, never mind. You can just go. I’ll protect myself. I don’t need you. It’s fine, I can do it all on my own, and if I die, who cares? Your Dad left because of what I did, and now you’re leaving too. Clearly, no one in the world cares about Grendel’s mother anymore, and they never did. I don’t know if I’ll see you again, after all, Beowulf will probably find the sword and kill me. I’ll try to put up a fight, but I don’t know if I can anymore. I’ll miss you, Grendel. Goodbye.\n\n“With My Luck”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isaac T., Age 16, California, USA\n\nDescription: A person laments their bad luck in life\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nLet’s get one thing straight, Lady Luck has never really been on my side…Ever. How have I come to this conclusion? Well, how many people do you know who are petrified of shoelaces? Yeah, that’s what I thought. You know, I didn’t start off scared of them. But being prone to tripping over not only your own but also other people’s shoelaces, can really do a number on a person. Now I’m a Velcro-wearing 18-year-old who has to scout the sidewalks for stray shoelaces when I go out on walks. But that’s not even the worst of it. Animals hate me. Put me within a hundred feet of any dog and it calls for at least a mile-long chase. What happened to that whole “Man’s Best Friend” thing? And let’s not forget about the silverware issue. My last attempt to use a fork led to a trip to the ER, where along the way my mom complained I was wasting her precious gasoline. Like I wanted to go to that germy hospital! I ended up catching some 24-hour virus from the man sitting next to me. And then there’s my sleeping arrangements. Which currently consists of me in a sleeping bag, on the floor, in the living room. (Side effects from this vary from body aches, stiff joints, and struggling mobility). But really, what’s a person to do? My bedroom is upstairs and attempting to get there has led to way too many sprained ankles and a few broken wrists. And the times when I did get upstairs safely I ended up falling out of bed at night and bruising myself. The doctors are sick of me at this point. I tried to tell that to my dad recently when he started badgering me about learning how to drive. But he ignored me. He doesn’t understand one trip around the block to fetch me a candy bar could get me a one-way express ticket to the Big Guy in the sky. And no offense, but I ain’t ready for that. To my family I’m just a “klutz” and “accident-prone,” and I’m always “overreacting”. They don’t see the issue I’m having for what it really is. But I know the truth! And I bet Lady Luck’s out there somewhere laughing her pretty little head off about the “luck” I have.\n\n“Alexander the Great”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Patrick Treybal, Age 18, South Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: Alexander the Great speaks to his brother after the death of their father.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nArrhidaeus, (beat) Father is dead. It seems he was killed in his sleep, and a knife was found, a Persian knife. The people of Macedonia do not know yet, we (beat) we have to break the news to them. (Beat) Why do you weep? Do you know what this means for us? (Beat) It means the war we’ve been dreaming of! A chance for us to strike back at that crumbling empire! Yes Father’s death, it hurts, but we all knew this was coming, he spoke out against those marauders for his entire life. For too long they have raided our coastline and enslaved our people, not to mention the Greeks. But they fought back! From Leonidas and his Spartans at Thermopylae to the Athenians in the Aegean Sea, to our father, and now us! The names Alexander and Arrhidaeus will ring throughout history as the men who took down Darius III! This is our opportunity (beat) for revenge! Brother, I am- we are the fire that will burn out the old and create a new future. We are that flame. We are that future! And if you will not join this crusade then I will be that flame. The time has come for you to decide dear brother, are you the ember that is stamped out by the heel of oppression or are you the blaze that will burn the vines of Persia? Tomorrow, I will ride to Athens for their support in the war. If you are the brother I claim you to be (beat) then I know you will join me.\n\n“Mom’s Yearbook”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Faith G., Age 14, Florida, USA\n\nDescription: A teen finds her mom’s high school yearbook\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nI was just in my mom’s closet looking for my jacket when I came across a box of her stuff from high school. Of course, I was curious, so I opened it up and found my mom’s high school yearbook, “Class of 1978.” It’s so funny! The hairstyles and clothes were so weird, and all the photos were in black and white. And I can’t believe my mom had big poofy hair and wore bell-bottom jeans. All the guys in the photos had shaggy hair and mustaches, it was like something straight out of a movie! Then I noticed something that made me pause, a picture of my mom wearing a t-shirt with a band logo on it holding an electric guitar. And all the girls she was with were wearing band t-shirts and holding instruments. I can’t believe it! My mom was a rocker in high school! I mean, you know my mom, she is so responsible and always seems put together and wears classy clothes, NOTHING like this. With every page, there were more surprises. My mom at school dances, sporting events, and even one where she was dressed as a cheerleader! I kind of feel a new connection to her. Seeing her in a different light reminds me that she had a life before I was born. I can’t wait to ask her about her days as a high schooler. I want to hear the cool stories and see more pictures of her when she was my age.\n\n“Adults and Their Debatable Sanity”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Durga Kalantre, Age 11, California, USA\n\nDescription: Do you ever question why adults say the things they do?\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nI think adults are reliable and trustworthy, most of the time. I hope. They look out for me and care about my interests and needs, even if they may be sucking me into the vortex of expectations. What I don’t like about grownups is that sometimes, they act as if they know everything. They say, “Don’t talk back!” But they also say, “Why are you being so quiet?” It’s kinda confusing. Like, do you want me to shut my mouth or open it? Be CLEAR, please. I can never tell when they’re being sarcastic so when they say something like, “You think this is funny, do ya?!” I want to say “No! I don’t think this is funny. You are screaming your head off; why would that be funny to me?” And another thing: when grownups do something outrageous they don’t seem to realize that children are going to question them. It’s natural: imagine someone starts acting like a beaver and commands you to do beaver stuff with them, but they don’t tell you why. They just give you the “I’m-older-than-you-so-you-better-listen-to-me” look. It’s confusing! But honestly, I suppose it’s all just to make me a better person. UNLESS THEY WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE BENT ON TAKING OVER THE WORLD AND TURNING CHILDREN INTO CYBORGS. Probably not. If not, I’ll go with the first explanation.\n\n“When Will I Be Enough For You?”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Kirsten A., Age 14, Maryland, USA\n\nDescription: A day in the life of a person with ADHD\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nI get it. I’m a klutz. I talk way too much. I forget everything. I’m always “daydreaming” as you call it. But why not take a look into my world?\n\nI’m in class. Nothing makes sense! I look around at everyone else, and they all seem to be effortlessly paying attention. Why not me? I turn to my friend, and ask, “Can you help me? I’m so confused.” She responds with four words I know I will be thinking about for a long time; “What don’t you understand?”\n\nI’m finally home. I’m so tired, but it’s frustrating because I didn’t really do anything. Maybe if I had been busy, I could justify my exhaustion. I have to do my homework. But, all I’m doing is just reading a sentence. Reading a sentence. Reading a sen- (Pause and breathe out.) “Turn off the fan.” I realize my brain has been asking me to do that for…. oh, I don’t know! I need water. I’m parched. I’ve been trying to stay more hydrated but “I’m thirsty” or “I’m hungry” turns into “I’ll get it when I’m done” turns into “Does this ever end?” I return to my room. The sun already set! I go to bed. I know I should get ready for tomorrow, but it’ll be fine! When will I ever learn?\n\nI finally remember to ask about the assignment. The teacher rolls his eyes. “What have you been doing for the past two weeks?” (Inner thought. Speak fast to simulate the chaos.) Two weeks?!? Where did all the time go? What have I been doing? Well, nothing, but I can’t say that… (pause) When will I be capable of functioning?\n\nI’m in my room, finally. I’m stressed. The project is due at the end of the week, and I have nothing. Nothing. When will I be able to comprehend this kind of information? You say, “Just focus. Concentrate. Try harder.” (Loudly) OH THAT I COULD TRY HARDER! YOU CANNOT FATHOM HOW MUCH EFFORT I PUT INTO THIS. (Quieter but with intensity) I will never reach your standards. They’re too high. I won’t make you move them, they’re there for a reason and I respect that. But it hurts so bad because I know that I will never reach them. I just have one question; When will I be enough for you?\n\n“Who Made That Cake?”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Rosie G., Age 12, Rolleston, New Zealand\n\nDescription: Planning a birthday party for Great Aunt Elaine goes wrong.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nAll I wanted was to earn my party planner badge at Brownies. I just needed to throw a small party for one of my friends or family. Lucky for me, my Great Aunt Elaine was turning 96! My mum thought I should wait until my cousin Bill’s birthday the week after – he was turning 4 so it would have been ideal. But I had to earn that badge before Maddy Thomas got in there before me again! Now, my Great Aunt Elaine is a well-known lady in our town. She used to own Elaine’s Bakes, the best bakery for miles around! People still talk about her red velvet cupcakes and the wedding cakes that were taller than me! It was pretty easy to send out the invites, all I had to do was tell Gabby the Gossip and she told everyone in town about my amazing surprise! Decorations – check! Food – check! Guests – check! I couldn’t have her bake her own birthday cake, so I just bought one at the store. I knew she’d be so happy seeing everyone she probably wouldn’t even notice! So when the big day arrived, Mum drove her to the supermarket to buy her cat food! The perfect distraction while we all crammed in her tiny two-bedroom retirement flat waiting for her arrival. I had cousins behind couches, friends under the table, and my dad playing lookout by the window. “She’s coming! Everybody hide!” We all held our breath as she walked through the door. “SURPRISE!” Everyone was smiling and laughing, except for Great Aunt Elaine. She turned ghostly white, then pointed at the cake and whispered, “Who made that cake?” Before she could say anything else she collapsed to the floor! Everyone panicked and started calling the ambulance. Meanwhile, I was trying to save the party and sang, “Happy Birthday.” As they carted Great Aunt Elaine into the back of the ambulance, she lifted her finger at me and said, “Never buy me a store-bought cake ever again!” And worst of all, I didn’t even get my party planner badge!\n\n“The Girl in the Corner “\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Nora Temperly, Age 12, Missouri, USA\n\nDescription: Life can look different for people after the school bell rings.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nHave you ever seen someone sitting alone, doing nothing? Just a blank mind, completely zoned out from everyone else? Or, have you seen someone so self-absorbed that the only thing they care about is themself? I want you to think about the parallels between the boy in the front of the class and the girl in the corner. I may not be much for storytelling, but I know this one very well. The boy in the front of the class would always laugh and joke with his friends, ignoring how much he bothered others around him. The girl in the corner would stay silent, never saying a word, wishing she was somewhere quiet. But once you take away the friends, the loud noise and laughter, and go home, what happens to them? The boy in the front of the class is all alone now. He doesn’t laugh or joke or mess around because he doesn’t have friends there to build him up. The girl in the corner? She changes for the better. When she gets to be alone, she has freedom. She makes herself laugh. She builds herself up. She doesn’t need the noise. She can mess around and not worry about the popular life the boy has. I used to know them both. I knew the boy in the front of the class and the girl in the corner. I used to be them. I used to be the class clown! But I also knew the sad girl in the corner, with no friends to boost her up until she got home and got to be herself. I know what it’s like to be scared of the eyes, but I also know what it’s like to need the eyes on you to please everyone. So don’t judge the boy in the front of the class. And don’t forget the girl in the corner. You never know what’s going on with them after the bell rings.\n\n“Too Many Ducks”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Bryce Fox, Age 15, Alabama, USA\n\nDescription: Too many ducks can be troublesome.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nWhat happens when you have too many ducks? I’ll tell you what happens. You see, I love ducks. I have 3,217 of them. But these ducks can get out of control. They pretty much run my house, WHICH I PAY RENT FOR! They’ve also caused a few disturbances with my neighbors, the poor mailman, and my best friend’s cat. The neighbors constantly talk my ear off about the ducks! “I find their droppings in my yard!” Or, “They’re too noisy at night!” I GET IT, BUT I CAN’T STOP THEM SUSAN! And then there’s the mailman. He’s too afraid to come to my house, and my neighbors have a pit bull! I have to go all the way down to the end of the street to get my mail, and even then I get an earful from him! It’s so annoying. I wish I could do something about it, but these ducks are in charge now. I suppose I could pay for my friend’s vet bill. Yeah, one of the ducks got territorial and took a chunk out of the cat’s tail. It was gruesome to see. I haven’t heard much from him since then, but that’s to be expected. Sometimes, I just want to run away from home because these ducks have become more than an issue. Or, maybe they need to go. I don’t know anymore. But one thing hasn’t changed, I still love ducks.\n\n“Dear Cancer”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Kinzie Zuroff, Age 13, California, USA\n\nDescription: What if you told “cancer” how you really feel?\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nI don’t hate you. You’ve been there my whole life, showing up in different loved ones, or in memories spoken by my family. Whatever the method, you have always been there. I really should loathe you, because you just keep taking and taking from me. You took both of my father’s parents. Because of you, I only know my grandma through my dad’s memories. You tried so hard to take my aunt away from her three kids. After all of these years, we thought you were done with her, but now you’re back. I can’t even talk to my cousin without the aching reminder of you. That would be enough to leave a mark on anybody, but no, you decided that wasn’t enough. You pursued my father in two different ways when you knew I was barely getting by. And now you’ve come after the one person I hoped and prayed you would never, ever touch…my generous, ever-loving grandma. I could resent you for what you’ve done to me, but I’ve learned that there is one thing you can’t take from me. The lessons. You taught me that I’m more resilient than I ever dreamed I could be. You taught me to have a grateful perspective on life that most people don’t have. You gave me an opportunity to belong, in a community so close-knit that I don’t hesitate to call them my brothers and sisters. You gave me the chance to see my grandma’s humorous, loving personality shine through the darkness of your presence. Without you, I would never have a deep bond with my dearest friend, because we stuck together through dark times. Lastly, you put my aunt through the worst torture imaginable, but, she didn’t let you win, not in a million years. You pushed her down and kept her on the floor, but I have to admit, without you, I wouldn’t have seen one of the greatest feats of perseverance in the world. Not only did she stand back up, she stood up taller than you could ever be. She looked you right in the eye and told you that she would help other families so you couldn’t hurt them like you hurt her. Many people are blinded by what you take. But I’ve had time to reflect and refine my relationship with you. You must know that you can be so cruel. At the same time, I thank you.\n\n“Santa Life”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Ava I., Age 15, Arizona, USA\n\nDescription: What is Santa’s life like during the other 364 days of the year?\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nEveryone knows what Santa does on that one special day of the year. But have you ever wondered what his life is like the other 364 days? Well, let me enlighten you. Santa’s got a bit of a weight issue. I mean, the guy spends his entire night squeezing down chimneys, carrying a giant sack of presents. I bet his exercise routine is like, “Do 50 squats, eat 50 cookies, repeat.” And let’s talk about his fashion sense. Red and white? Really? It’s like he’s the ultimate brand ambassador for Coca-Cola. But let’s not forget the list of naughty and nice kids. I can just picture Santa sitting there, scratching his head, trying to remember if little Tommy was the one who stuck gum in his sister’s hair or if it was Jimmy. And what happens if he mixes up the lists? Imagine waking up to a lump of coal because Santa had a temporary lapse in memory. Awkward! And what about those flying reindeer? It’s like Santa found the world’s most talented animals and said, “You know what? Let’s form a supergroup.” And Rudolph, the star of the show, gets all the attention with his shiny nose. I bet the other reindeer are jealous and plotting some sort of reindeer revenge. So, next time you’re sitting by the fireplace, eagerly waiting for Santa’s arrival, take a moment to appreciate his bizarre life. After all, behind that big, jolly belly and white beard, there’s a man who’s got the world’s most ridiculous job. And if he can bring joy to millions while managing an army of flying reindeer, well, he deserves a round of applause and maybe a cookie or two.\n\n“Survival Tips on a Strange Planet”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Ali Haque, Age 13, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nDescription: Commando Zorp is teaching his new alien recruits how to survive on the abandoned planet Earth.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nListen up! I have been here for a couple of months taking recon on this strange planet to see if it is suitable to be our new home. Today is Creature Survival Day. I am going to share some very helpful tips so pay attention! (Starts pacing) The creatures of this planet are extremely devious. They look cute and harmless, but they’ll stop at nothing to get under your skin! (Pause) One of the first creatures to deceive us is the wretched butterbug. (Looks confused) Or was it butterfly? … No that’s ridiculous. Now, where was I, oh right, the butterbug is a small colorful winged creature. When you see one, you will be tempted to let it land on your finger. But you must resist the urge. As soon as that thing gets within 3 feet of you, it will try to bite your face off! We have found that the best way to prevent a butterbug attack is to cover your face. If the butterbug does not see your face, it will not attack. That is why we always wear masks when we are exploring. Now the next creature, although slightly less dangerous, is ten times as adorable! (Shows a photo of a puppy and the new recruits react.) Awwww? BE QUIET! This creature is known as the pupperie. (Listens) What did you say? Puppy? That’s preposterous, as I was saying…..the pupperie is a very tricky fella. It will make cute sounds, but then out of nowhere, it will start chasing you. (Takes out dog treats) The key to protection against pupperies is these tasty treats. When you see a pupperie, you must first make sure that the pupperie sees the treat, then you must throw it (Demonstrates), and proceed to run in the opposite direction. I also like to keep a couple extra in my pocket in case I get hungry. (Winks) I fear NO man… (Zorp holds out a sketch of a goose) … but this thing, it scares me. You see this? This is called a goose. If you see one, your only option is to run for your life! We lost ten men to these winged monsters! So, don’t underestimate their danger, or you will become their next meal. (Pauses, collects himself, and smiles.) Well, thanks for joining me for today’s survival lesson. Tomorrow we will talk about the dangers left behind by the past inhabitants of this planet, and their sonic weapons of torture. (Holds up a pair of headphones)\n\n“The Final Act”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Aaron Barbosa, Age 14, Texas, USA\n\nDescription: A magician improvises their way through a failing act.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nAnd now ladies and gentlemen, for my final act, I’m going to make this rabbit disappear! (The rabbit might be in a hat or on a cart) Now, as I wave my wand around. (pause) Excuse me, everyone, I seem to have forgotten my magical wand. (Looks for the wand.) Where did I put it? Where did I put it?! (Continues searching.) Aha! There it is! Apologies for the little mishap, back to my trick. (pause) Hold on, I didn’t do the trick yet, where is the rabbit? (to self) I knew this would happen! I told him bringing a rabbit on stage wouldn’t work! (back to the audience) Ladies and gentlemen, I have prepared a better and cooler final act! I’m going to make myself disappear! (to self) Where are my smoke bombs? I’m pretty sure they were in my left pocket. (Turns to the audience.) Everyone, I was joking about making myself disappear. My real act is- (Phone rings.) Hello? Boss, I’m sorry but it’s not only my fault! I told him that the rabbit wouldn’t work. (pause) Yes, I already tried that one, but he forgot to put them in my pocket! I’ll think of something ok? Don’t lose your marbles. (Hangs up) I sincerely apologize to everybody for the difficulties during this show. We will give a full refund over at the ticket booth. (Phone rings again) Hold on, everybody. (Picks up phone) Hello? (Short pause) I told you I would think of something, and I did, you can’t blame me. (Short pause) What?! You can’t fire me! (pause) Because I quit! (Stomps off stage briefly before stomping back in.) Remember, refunds are at the ticket booth. (Stomps back off.)\n\n“Danger! Danger!”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isaac T. Age 15, California, USA\n\nDescription: A young man believes his mother’s extracurricular suggestions are out to get him.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nMy mom keeps telling me that I need to find some sort of extracurricular activity to keep my mind “stimulated.” Whatever that means. So here I am against my will looking for something I can do after school. My mom thought I’d look handsome in a baseball uniform, but I’m not stupid. Those baseballs come at you over 80 mph! So I had to tell her a big fat N-O on that one. Then she suggested hockey. But if I want my teeth separated from my mouth I could just ask my dentist to yank ’em for me. We moved down the list to golf. Mom said golf was a calm, relaxing, non-violent game but I beg to differ. If somebody nearby yells “fore!” and I don’t hear them, they could get a hole-in-one. In my mouth!!! What? It could happen… Tennis? Not a chance. Tennis balls come at you just as quickly as baseballs. And the rackets, don’t get me started on rackets. Cornhole? Heck no! Those beanbags could easily become dangerous weapons! For a split second, I thought chess would be good, but after some contemplating… What if some guy got mad and flipped a chess board and a pawn hit the other guy in the eye? I’d probably end up being the guy on the receiving end of things! So I scratched chess off my list. Then, out of the blue, Mom says, “How about football?” And I know, she’s got it out for me.\n\n“Why Can’t I Fly?”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Kallie Gatrell, Age 14, North Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: A penguin wonders why they are the only bird in the zoo not able to fly.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nHey, Randy, can I talk to you about something? Wait, Randy, you actually might want to sit down for this. Okay, well, I feel like I’m a worthless bird. I mean out of all ten thousand bird species, why am I one of the 60 that can’t fly? That’s 0.6%. It’s not fair. Why can’t I just soar like the mighty eagle? Why can’t I see this earth from a bird’s eye view? Honestly, I would even take the amount of flight a chicken has. Which isn’t a lot. I’m just an embarrassment to the zoo because all the other birds can fly, but I can’t. Have you ever seen how all the little humans point and laugh at me? That’s a real blow to my confidence. I even heard that Eric in the owl exhibit was making fun of me just because I can’t fly while he’s over there asleep all the time, getting waited on wing and foot. I’m done with all the ridicule I get just because I can’t fly. I mean, compared to them, I have some pretty great skills. I mean, are they able to slide on their stomachs? No. Can they swim underwater to catch fish? No. So why do they always say, “Hey, Chilly, how’s the weather down there?” If they came down and just waddled in my flippers for a day, they might realize how hard it is to be me. I mean, at least I don’t have to worry about getting a sunburn… right? You know what, I’m done with the jokes, and I won’t take them anymore. I’m proud of who I am, even if I’m not the same as everyone else. I’m going to show everyone that I’m just as capable as they are, even if I can’t fly.\n\n“Am I Dead or Alive?”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Aster Garcia, Age 16, New Mexico, USA\n\nDescription: A war veteran struggling with the difficulties they face after the battle.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nEveryone was telling me it was the right choice, but looking back I’m not sure it was. Bootcamp was fine. I was making friends and learning how hard this job would be. I never thought it would be too much…until we got called up. When our sergeant told us, my body stiffened, and my heart rate sped up. My only thought was, I am about to die. I think everyone had the same reaction, none of us were ready. I mean, we had only enlisted a few weeks before and now they were sending us to the front lines?!? I had no choice but to go. When I was out there I realized something. The moment I put my signature on that paper, I signed my life away. The government doesn’t care about me. I’m just another body for them to dispose of in hopes they’ll end up on top. But they completely owned me, and the only way out was death. I tried to survive. I didn’t want to be just another casualty. Then one day when I was walking through a village and my foot hit something hard. I heard a beep and frantically tried to run away, but I wasn’t fast enough. The mine completely blew off my leg and I was left there to die. My whole squad abandoned me, but I can’t blame them. They were just trying to survive. As I lay there, in the worst pain in the world, the sun just grew brighter and brighter until I couldn’t see. My only thought was “am I dead or alive?” Days later I woke up in a hospital bed, with all sorts of things hooked up to me, and here I am now. My whole life screwed, just because I signed my name on that piece of paper.\n\n“Why Am I Not Enough?”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Karly Anderson, Age 14, Texas, USA\n\nDescription: A teen goes through their daily routine to meet the world’s standard of what it means to be enough.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nWhy am I not enough? 4 am, wake up, work out, and shower. I don’t want to, but I have to in order to be enough. Athletic kids are enough. 6 am, straighten my natural curls like they never existed, and apply the makeup I barely know how to use. Because I have to fit in to be enough. Girls who wear makeup are enough. 6:30 am, no breakfast today I had a big dinner last night and every girl in school that wants a dying chance of a homecoming date weighs less than 115. So I have to weigh that too. Skinny girls are enough. 7 am, walk to school it’ll be healthier anyways. Cardio is how skinny girls look even slimmer. The less meat and more bones you are, means you’re enough. 8 am, first bell. I know the answer, but I won’t say it. Pretty girls can’t be smart. And to be enough you need to be pretty. Smart girls can’t be enough until they’re pretty. 11 am, lunch. Best I just keep chewing on my gum. Every popular girl always has gum. Popularity means your enough. 2 pm, last class. I need to pee but instead, I roam the halls. Cool girls roam the halls. Cool girls are enough. 3 pm, walk home because you can never have too much cardio. 4 pm, realize I’ve spent another day trying to live out an unfulfillable, immeasurable standard of “enough.”\n\n“I Want to be an Astronaut!”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Oana Mustata, Age 11, Sibiu, Romania\n\nDescription: A kid dreams of becoming an astronaut for the most fantastical reasons.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\n(enthusiastically, with a sword in hand) Hey Mom! I have decided what I want to be when I grow up! I want to be an astronaut so I can fly with a rocket at super high speeds vrrrooommm, vrrrooommm! (pause) I guess I should think of what I want to take in my luggage. Hmmm. Chocolate cereals… those are goood. Oat cereals… those are good and also healthy… dog food, this sword, a camera of course, a knife, a food container, sunscreen, and a bottle. I think that’s about it. (short pause) Well, I have eaten cereal with all kinds of milk except milk from the Milky Way… I think it’s cosmically good! And that’s what the bottle is for, to bring you some of it for your coffee! After I’ve had breakfast, I will go feed the puppies from Canis Major and Canis Minor. They’re probably starving since no one feeds them. Then, I will go and explore space. I can’t wait to see all those flying space rocks and the zoo in the sky! I know it has all sorts of interesting creatures, like the bears from Ursa Minor and Major, the winged horse from Pegasus, and the lion from Leo and I heard there’s even a Phoenix! For lunch, I’m going to the Moon. There, I will need my knife, to cut some of that Swiss cheese and take some for you in the food container. Then, I will go to the Sun! I’ll be the first human being who gets there! I’ll need that sunscreen because I heard the Sun can burn your skin if it’s too hot. My last stop will be Saturn, to marvel at its rings. I’ll check it very closely, maybe it has an extra one. Let me tell you a secret, I did my research, and no one has a ring from Saturn, so it would be extra special, just for you! After I finish my adventures, I will head home. If I meet any aliens in their spaceships, I’ll try to be friendly, but if they’re hostile, I’ll need my sword! You don’t have to worry about me. As soon as I defeat them, I’ll come home, give you the ring and we’ll chat! We’ll look at all the pictures I took, and you’ll drink your Milky Way coffee and eat your Moon cheese. (pause) OK! I better go and prepare my luggage now. It won’t be long until I grow up, so it’s better to do this now so I don’t forget anything!\n\n“Listen to Me”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isabella Whittingahan Jimenez, Age 14, Oklahoma, USA\n\nDescription: A 17-year-old argues with their mother about feeling under pressure\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nYou’re not listening to me! I’m tired! I’m tired of always trying so hard, and it’s never enough for you. You’re never satisfied. You know, you never once told me you’re proud of me. No, stop, let me speak. I can’t take it anymore, I’m tired. I’m tired of everything. You always want more and more and there’s like this hole in my heart that I thought I could fill if I made you proud of me. Now I’m realizing that’s stupid because you’ll never be proud. I’ll never be enough; I’ll never be everything you want me to be. Your expectations are so high, it’s not letting me breathe. The pressure you put on me is like a weight on my shoulders and I try to make things better, but everything just stays the same. Not one “congratulations”, or “I’m happy for you”, or even a “good job”. You make me feel like I’m always behind. Like I’m not trying my best when actually, I’m trying even more than my best. All for you to ignore it, dismiss it. I don’t want you to do it anymore. I’m done. I’m done trying to be perfect for you. You’ve never been concerned about anything that I wanted. I sacrifice my happiness for yours but you’re never happy. But it’s okay, it’s fine. I’ve accepted it, there’s nothing I can do for you. I’m going to do what I want now, for me. So I can be happy.\n\n“How Do You Silence Your Phone?”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Addison Steffer, Age 14, Texas, USA\n\nDescription: A villain gets a phone call from their mother while fighting a hero.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nWell, well, well… take a look at what we have here. It would appear that you and the rest of your so-called “heroes” have been bested by a villain. By me! (Laughs manically) Oh, you poor, poor thing. You thought I was bad before? Just wait. I have all the power now. This is all going according to plan. And now, nobody can stop m- (phone rings) …One second please… (answers phone, starts whispering) …no, no, Mom, I can’t talk right now. I’m busy. (Pause, getting louder) What do you think I’m doing? I’m working! Just turn on the news. You’ll see me. (pause) Mom, I will not wave at the camera, I have a reputation to uphold. (pause) No, no, no, no, no, don’t get dad. (waves) I’m waving, see? I’m waving! HI MOM! (Stops waving, turns back, and sighs) Anyway, why were you calling? Yes, of course, I’m coming to dinner, why wouldn’t I be? (pause) No, Mom, I am not inviting them. (pause) I don’t know, maybe because we are MORTAL ENEMIES? (Pause, turns to the hero) My Mom wants to know if you want to come for dinner tomorrow night. (Turns back to phone) They said no. (pause, turns back to hero) She said to tell you that it’s meatloaf. (Turns back to phone) It’s still a no. (pause) Ok, I really have to go now, Mom. Stop calling me while I’m at work. (pause) Because I don’t know HOW to silence my phone. (pause) What do you mean there’s a button? There’s no button! (pause) Mom, I am not asking them to help me silence my phone. Do you know how embarrassing that would be? (pause) Fine, fine, I’ll ask. (Turns to hero) How do you silence your phone? (Turns back to phone) They don’t know either. (pause) Ok, Mom, I have to go, just don’t call me while I’m working, ok? I’ll see you tomorrow. (pause) Mhm, I love you too, bye. (Turns back to hero) Where was I? Oh, yes, that’s right, I will become the most powerful villain on this planet, and NO ONE CAN STO- (phone rings) Mom, we just talked about this, what do you need? (pause) Wait, Stacy’s Mom did what? (Pause, turns to hero) Sorry, I really need to take this. You can go. We can do this another time. (Turns back to the phone and walks away) You have got to be kidding. She cut all of her hair off? What does Stacy think about that? (exits)\n\n“Lost”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Abbey Sourov, Age 14, Seattle, Washington, USA\n\nDescription: Sixteen-year-old Bianca is grieving and frustrated. She is confronted by her sister as she prepares to search for their lost brother (who may or may not be gone for good).\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\n(Surprised, she gasps.) Oh. It’s you. Why are you back here? I thought I’d be alone, sneaking out this late. You can’t tell anyone you saw me here. Just listen to what I’m about to say, okay? I’m going to find our brother. I’ve got everything I need, a camera, a flashlight…(Summoning courage) I’m going to find him, okay? And you can’t convince me otherwise, because I can’t just keep sitting here, day after day, doing nothing, and feeling so…so WORTHLESS! (Tearing up. Exhales to calm herself.) It’s just that everyone has given up on him; even you and…and our parents have decided to move on, but I- I can’t…okay? I can’t just…leave him! He wouldn’t have left me. And I know he’s still out there. He’s… He has to be. And I can’t even live in this house anymore, because it’s so full of his memories, full of the things that we did together. For crying out loud, I sob when I see our favorite books at the library, or those frogs at the zoo we used to like. I feel like I’m going insane, and I…(Gasping for breath and trailing off)…I… (Wiping her eyes) You gotta let me go. I have to go. Alone. (Laughs humorlessly) It’s funny…because I really am so tired of being alone.\n\n“Visit to the Briarville Library”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Elizabeth Pall, Age 16, Florida, USA\n\nDescription: A bookkeeper from a town stuck in time, welcomes a guest to her library.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nOh! I didn’t see you there. Do forgive me, we don’t get many visitors to the Briarville Library. If Dr. Reginald and his mad experiments aren’t enough to scare people off, the 500-step staircase has a way of dissuading guests. But I’m glad you’re here. My name is Olivia Lester, I’m the sole bookkeeper, and sole inhabitant, here at the library. Well, except for our resident ghost, Arnold. He doesn’t say much. You really couldn’t have come on a better day. Today’s my 21st birthday! Though, come to think of it, yesterday was also my 21st birthday. And so was the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that. In fact, I can’t remember a day when it wasn’t my 21st birthday. Funny, isn’t it? Ooh! Do you hear that? That’s the bell tower; it’s 2 o’clock! Come, come, look out this window here. There! There he is. That man down there, do you see him? He comes by every day at exactly two o’clock to feed the gargoyles. Brave man he is, most of the townsfolk are too scared to even go near our stone beasts. An irrational fear, of course, they’re perfectly harmless. Most of the time. I wonder who he is. Maybe someday I’ll be brave enough to ask his name and invite him into the library. Maybe someday. Thank you all for stopping in today. Please, make yourself at home. If you need any assistance don’t hesitate to ask me. But watch out for Vera our Venus Flytrap over there. She’s been a bit peckish lately and I don’t want any of you fine guests to lose a finger.\n\n“Halloween Mix-up”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Madison Brown, Age 16, Idaho, USA\n\nDescription: A girl on Halloween encounters someone with a really cool and realistic costume.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nHi! I saw you from across the street, and I just gotta say, I love your Halloween costume! It looks so realistic! I mean the fur and the teeth are really authentic. The mask even moves when you talk. It’s such a convincing werewolf, you’d almost think it’s real! Hahaha!! Honestly, it’s kinda creepy. It looks like you could eat me and my grandma up. Get it? Because I’m Little Red Riding Hood? And her whole story was…whatever you get it. You know I DIY’d my costume, and it took me HOURS, but it’s nowhere near as good as yours. Seriously, yours puts mine to shame. Heck, it puts everyone’s costume to shame. So did you buy it or do it yourself? (Don’t let him answer) I ALWAYS make my own because I’m so creative, but I understand that not everyone is as talented as me! Speaking of which, yours is so good you should enter the costume contest. I’d bet you win, which sucks for me, but hey maybe I’ll get second, which is in some ways better than first. (giggles) You’ll have to tell me where you got your costume, so I can win next year. If you tell me I’ll invite you to my Halloween Party, which is going to be like totally cool, but if you don’t you can’t come! JK!!! Hahaha (Serious) But not really. So, tell me where did you get it? (He answers) Oh! You’re a real werewolf. (awkward silence) Whatever, you can still come to my Halloween Party.\n\n“By the Mystic Monologues of Munnopor”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Henry Osher, Age 17, Connecticut, USA\n\nDescription: Hero interrupts the Villain’s monologue\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nListen buddy, I’m gonna stop you right there. You don’t understand how many times I’ve heard this kind of thing already. I’m honestly sick of monologues. You’re just gonna waste my time explaining your master plan and patting yourself on the back even though we both already know how this is gonna go. I’m gonna send you packing like I do to everyone else, and you’ll end up nothing more than a two-bit, D-list villain with an inferiority complex. If this was a comic book, they’d put you in a filler issue, give you a mediocre backstory, and never talk about you again. All you’re gonna be is a piece of trivia for superhero nerds with nothing better to spend their time on. But me? I’m the Golden Boy! I literally get paid to beat up people like you. So I have an idea, instead of giving me a novel, how about you just sum it up in a few words and let me enjoy the rest of my Sunday? What’s it gonna be? Kidnapping the Mayor? Bridge bombing? Mass mind control? I’ve seen it all buddy. You’re nothing special. That’s what you gotta get through your thick skull. You’ll never be an archenemy or on the starting roster of an evil team. You’ll never take over the world or have any henchmen. You’ll never do anything with your sad little life and that’s that. Oh, did I make you cry? Sorry man, but the truth hurts. You know what they say; if you can’t handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen. Now let’s get this over with.\n\n“Am I the Only One?”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Emma Morrill, Age 18, Michigan, USA\n\nDescription: A girl addresses her bullying in a video she uploads for the world to see.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\n(Turns webcam on) I could come on here and say I am fine, and that today was an amazing day, but that would be lying. My life has been nothing but painful for the past two years, with names thrown at me from every direction and pranks pulled on me just to see me in pain and agony. My self-esteem has gone down, and half of the time I don’t even want to show up to school or be seen at a store or a mall. Bullying has been my life at school and even on the internet. People say such cruel and harsh things…and I believe them sometimes. What have I done to deserve this? Why can’t everyone just be accepted for who they are? I’ve been dieting and trying new styles just to make people like me more. But even then they make fun of me. Even when I lost ten pounds, or when the clothing was their style! I’ve started wearing baggy clothes because I am seen as overweight. I wear makeup due to the fact that I am seen as a monster with a bunch of acne. Will it ever stop? I literally come home in tears, but nobody cares what I think. The more bullying happens to me the more I become depressed. Anxiety hits me from every angle. I want to change schools and throw away social media to get away from the one thing that is stopping me from being happy. Bullies. If society keeps going on like this the teen world will be in shambles. I just have to say one more thing. Is bullying truly what the world needs? Or do we need to rebuild the world on peace and trust? (Turns off the webcam and uploads video to YouTube).\n\n“Circle of Unhappiness”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isabelle Bidal, Age 18, Ontario, Canada\n\nDescription: A young teenager struggles with their appearance and clothing\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nIt’s not that I don’t think I’m beautiful, I do… sometimes. The problem is that no matter how many times you tell me this shirt doesn’t make me look bad or that skirt fits perfectly, the mirror tells me otherwise. I mean how long will it take for me to realize it doesn’t matter? It’s one thing to say but I need to believe it. I know I should just wear things that make me happy. I know that nobody cares enough to judge what I look like when they have their own insecurities. I know it isn’t worth this much energy and anxiety, but I can’t stop. The shirt is too tight, or too loose, or not the right colour, and the pants are too rigid, or too short, or too… everything. I’m just in this circle of unhappiness because I don’t look like I want to. I don’t look like everyone else, and I don’t know how to fix it. But…maybe that’s okay. Maybe, just maybe, if I could find happiness in people and experiences, rather than clothes and looks, I would wake up and look forward to picking an outfit every day. Maybe… a source of anxiety could become a source of joy. It just takes a lot of work, and I don’t know if I can do it.\n\nWatch a video performance of this monologue here!\n\n“Scars”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Cassie F\n\nDescription: A girl with a skin condition acknowledges all her scars and learns to embrace them.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nThe first time I remember being “physically hurt” I was probably 7 or 8, and I was on a bicycle. My sister left her scooter on the road, and I went crashing into it. All I saw was a blur of the ground, and then the sky, then the ground, and then sky again. My mom screamed and came running to help me. When I realized what had happened, I was bleeding from my arms, knees, knuckles…pretty much any exposed skin that you can imagine. I have scars from that one. The second time I remember being hurt is when I was maybe 9 or so. I was so dumb. I tried diving headfirst into a pool that was 4 feet deep. Yeah, you can probably imagine how well that went. I hit the top of my forehead. It took about a roll of paper towels to clear away the blood…and tears if I’m being honest. Those scars never really affected me. I never thought twice about it when kids at school would ask how I got them. But when it comes to my skin condition, those, those get to me. I have blotches on my arms and the backs of my knees that I can’t get rid of no matter what. They won’t tan, and no lotion or potion will erase them. They just exist. I’ve had them for as long as I can remember, and I have no clue why God chose me to have them. But, that’s just how it turned out. Most days they make me feel disgusting and ugly. When people see the scars or the blotches, I freeze. I’m worried they’ll think horrible things about me. But those splotches and blotches are a part of me. All my scratches, scrapes, and slices are. All my scars are. And in a way, I love them. They show where I’ve been, but also give me hope for where I’m going. They show how I’ve been hurt, but also how I’ve healed. I guess I love them. My scars are beautiful.\n\n“From Ribeye to Filet Mignon”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Liam Cantin, Age 12, Quebec, Canada\n\nDescription: A middle aged dog is determined to not like babies…Especially not the one his human parents have brought home.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nThis is the worse day of my life, for real this time. Worse than the time I had a tick stuck in my ear. I swear it wasn’t my fault. It was a big misunderstanding. I never intended to chew and steal the pacifier, I thought it was for me, a new gift! You would’ve snapped too if your owner brought back one of those revolting creatures, also known as a B.A.B.Y. Man, all they do is cry and cry and cry, twenty-four seven. This baby has stolen ALL of MY attention. How do you think that makes me feel, huh? One minute they’re all like aww who’s a good boy, who wants a doggy ice cream treat, do you want a belly rub, or a head scratch? What about a nice LONG walk? Then of course “Baby Erk” had to drop into our home. And they just dumped me, that’s right, dumped me for that ugly, smelly, poop machine. I’m lucky if I eat three times a day. I used to get Ribeye, now all I get is Filet Mignon, the portion size dropped significantly, as well as the fat content! Uhhhh, I just vomited, thinking about him. You know what I need? A vacation. That would feel sooo good. I’d finally get a break from him pulling my poor tail and plucking my precious apricot colored-fur. Oh yes, my nose would finally be able to smell the sweet scent of roses. I wouldn’t be stressed to step in his “acid reflux” secretions. Oh, is that a piece of PB&J he just threw on the floor? You know what, maybe “Baby Erk” isn’t so bad? Maybe I can tolerate him? Just this once. No!!! I didn’t say we can be friends…don’t go putting words into my mouth!\n\n“The Perfect Day”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Kara Smith, Age 14, North Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: A student is asked to imagine their perfect day.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nWhat’s my idea of the perfect day? Honestly, it would have to be when I was six or seven years old. Those were the days when I didn’t feel anxiety or sadness. The only thing I worried about was missing an assignment at school or dropping my ice cream on the floor. Life was good and easy, like nothing in the world could hurt me. Now things are different and unstable…like a terrible patchwork put together. But if I could magically have that perfect day, it really wouldn’t matter the location. Preferably I’d like for it to be something like a big day out with my family. Then I’d get to talk to my friends about how great it was. And my old childhood friend would still be kind to me. Or maybe the perfect day would be playing with my cousin at my old house with no chaos or drama to disrupt it all. Just two kids playing. Or maybe the perfect day would just be a regular, calm day in elementary school. Back when the kids weren’t loud and obnoxious. When they weren’t mean and tormenting. Back when the teachers would only discipline the ones who deserved it, not the innocent ones. But I guess we can’t go back in time, can we? We just have to move on and let our scars tell the stories. Who knows, maybe there will be a perfect day in the future. I hope so.\n\n“Inner Thoughts of an Ex-Lioness”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Erin Ryan, age 18, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nDescription: A cat muses on how its mistress doesn’t appreciate it enough.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nI can’t believe this; I’m locked out again. After all I do for her, following her around the house to keep her safe, bringing her gifts, that I have hunted for her. And yet, she chooses to keep me locked outside of this door. I can sit here, and I can meow for hours, knowing she’s right inside. But rarely does she open the door to me now. (pause) Perhaps it is because I take a special interest in some of her plants. But I think they are rather nice against my fangs and surely, she would understand that. I mean I see her do something with her teeth, it must be similar right? But every time I try to do something with my teeth I get shooed out. (pause) I have been her protector since I came here. If only they would try to understand me. When I walk to the door that is clearly a sign I no longer wish to be here. But she waits for me to sit and beg, like some kind of… dog. (pause) Although I guess she can be useful for some things like bringing down the jar of the magic tasty food and cleaning out the old poop box. But other than that, honestly, I could live alone. I used to run outside all day and night before I came here. Now I’m forced to stay inside, just watching the nature that I used to prowl. So, when I ask for things like to be let into her room, I expect a little more pep in the step. Especially since they have tamed me into a protector. (gasp) Don’t even get me started on those things they call dogs. Oh! Big. Wet. Smelly. And there’s two of them. They’re the bane of my existence. I will not make friends with such oafish creatures. I will stick to my own. And keep yelling at the door, hoping one day she’ll let me in again.\n\nWatch a video performance of this monologue here!\n\n“After the Movie”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Tesia Hennessy, Age 15, South Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: A teen is frustrated that their parent doesn’t accept them despite all they’ve done to try to conform.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nI do work hard. Maybe not in the way you think, but I work hard. I work hard to be utterly ordinary. I work hard to get good grades, but to not be the top of my class. I work hard to be funny, but to not be known as “the funny friend.” I work hard to be sporty, but not too sporty, to be artsy but not too artsy, to be quirky but to make sure that my quirks are normal. For example, I like yellow, the least liked color. I know everything there is to know about The Lord of the Rings, but only because – your words, not mine – I “went through a phase in middle school. ”I wear normal clothes. Do my hair in a normal way. Have a normal sleeping schedule, have normal reactions- I laugh the appropriate amount at sit-coms. I cry the appropriate amount at dramas. I’m scared the appropriate amount at horrors, and I’m thrilled the appropriate amount at thrillers. I’ve calculated every move, gesture, emotion, facial expression, every minute detail to the “perfect normal” because all you ever wanted was a normal kid, but it’s just not enough. Because when we’re at the movies, and it’s too loud, I can’t leave because “it’s loud for everyone.” And I can’t buy candy with my own money because “it’s unfair” even though everyone else is eating popcorn that you bought for them, but I can’t stand the texture of popcorn. I’m sick of being normal for you. I am sick. At least, you think I’m sick. And maybe I am, but I’m not going to pretend I’m normal anymore. I’m tired of sacrificing my identity just to make your life a little more comfortable.\n\n“What Luck!”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Isaac T., age 14, California, USA\n\nDescription: A long-time player of the lottery runs into some bad luck.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nFor years now I’ve played the lottery. And in doing so, I’ve wasted so much time and money. Not only that, but I end up losing more than I win. Heck, I’ve never won! Well, okay, fine. That’s a lie. I did buy of those cheap $1 tickets before, and guess what I won?! Another ticket! Isn’t that just the bee’s knees! But that’s not even the worst of it! One day, they had a special lottery offer. The prize was millions! I went out and bought as many tickets as I could afford. Which was quite a few, mind you. Apparently, I’m not the only one who likes to gamble though. There were tons of people waiting in line after me. And oh boy! When they found out that I had bought the last ticket, things start getting interesting. People yelled, screamed, argued. Most surprising of all though, people started whipping out their money to buy the tickets from ME. At first, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t dare give up even a single ticket. What if one of them was the winner? If I gave up even one of them up, would I give up my chances of winning? But, as quickly as I thought those things, I asked myself, “What are my chance of winning really?” Like, honestly… I’ve never won a thing in my life. Except for that other ticket of course. But here, right now, I could sell the tickets I had already bought and make a tidy little profit. So, I sold them for a little more than I paid, and by the end of the day I had made about double of what I had spent. Plus, I still had two tickets with me! And being in good spirits, I went home and gave one of the tickets to my newly 18-year-old brother, absolutely free. And what happened then you ask? Well, the next thing I know, the numbers were announced and, like always, I didn’t win. But someone I know did! And that someone was my brother. The brother to whom I gave the ticket to! The brother who had never even played the lottery before that day! The brother who didn’t share a single cent with me!! Didn’t even say thank you!!! The brother who then moved out and we never heard from him again! What luck!\n\n“Pressure”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Jeremiah Young, Age 16, Kansas, USA\n\nDescription: A student struggles with their life\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nMy sister gets away with everything. According to my parents and all the teachers, my sister, the class president, the popular kid, the star student, is excellent and never does anything wrong. Everyone holds me up to her standards. It’s always, “When Emily was your age, she already…”, or “maybe if you just follow what Emily does, you would do it right.” I am sick and tired of always being compared to her. No one ever stops to think about my feelings. They never seem to care about anything that concerns me unless I make a mistake. I know I am not the best at, well, anything, but is it too much to ask for a “good job Julien” or “we are so proud of you”? It must be too hard because I haven’t heard anyone say that stuff to me my whole life. Just once, I want the praise that Emily gets. Just once, I want to be a good comparison. I don’t want to be the screw-up that I am. People say you shouldn’t live for the praise of other people, but I think the opposite is true. Praise means you’re actually doing something right in your life. I’ve never gotten any recognition, so clearly, I must not be doing anything right. And I have no clue where I would even start. No matter what I do, I don’t think I’ll ever be good enough. What breaks me the most is that no one sees me hurting. No one sees me cry. Not because I don’t show it, but because they don’t bother looking for it.\n\n“Her Last Words”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Emily McLaren, Age 14, Sydney, Australia\n\nDescription: Medusa waits in her cave at the top of a mountain hidden from the world, until Perseus arrives with a sharp sword and shield.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nYou don’t waste time, do you? I thought it would take longer for you to arrive. It’s quite a momentous mountain. The other men took far longer. (Medusa is amused at Perseus looking at the statues surrounding him) Don’t be scared, they can’t hurt you. They’re just… statues, now. So, am I right to assume you’ve come for my head? It was wise of you to bring a shield. No one’s been smart enough to try that before. Though I suppose it wasn’t really your idea, was it? Only someone with the blessings of Athena could have enough foresight to think of using something shiny to deflect my gaze…You won’t need it. I’m not planning on turning you to stone anyway. There is just something I need you to do for me, and my head is yours. All you have to do is turn princess Andromeda and Poseidon’s Sea serpent into stone. After that I don’t mind what you do. You will have a deadly weapon for life. No one will dare oppose you. That power will be better in your hands then mine. It will be better if I’m dead. My life is useless anyway. I can’t make any friends, can’t fall in love, or be loved, and I can’t even walk into town without everyone around me turning into garden ornaments. The only thing I want to have before I leave this world is the knowledge that I got my revenge on Athena, the goddess who made me like this. If you turned Andromeda to stone Athena would be furious. Turning the serpent to stone wouldn’t hurt either. After all, Poseidon is the reason why Athena was even mad to begin with. If he hadn’t made me fall in love with him, I never would have been turned into… this! And besides, if you turn that monster into stone, you’ll be a hero! You won’t even need to barter the fates for your fame like Achilles did! You’ll be famous without any drawbacks! Though if you go back on your word and marry the princess, I swear I’ll be cursing you from the underworld. You’ll have to live with that regret for the rest of your days. Knowing that you angered an old priestess tired of the world and its trials. So, do we have a deal?\n\n“Is This Normal?”\n\nBy: Amira Reid, Age 16, Ontario, Canada\n\nDescription: A teen talks to her mom about how her life is far from normal.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nThe first memory I have isn’t happy or filled with laughter. It’s being drowned in a bathtub because Pedro was asked to give me a bath instead of playing soccer with his buddies down the street. Was that normal for you Mom? Did you not think maybe that was a red flag? Then there was the time I woke up in the middle of the night and had to use the bathroom. I was just a little kid and in Guatemala we had to go outside to use the bathroom. Pedro was mad I woke him up so he hit me. And kicked me. Was that normal to you Mother? But I guess that led to something wonderful because when Grandma, Nene, found out I got to live with her in America. I remember waking up and crawling in her bed to warm up. I remember her fingernails gently scratching my head as she scrubbed shampoo into my hair. I remember drinking chocolate milk while she drank coffee. She would walk me down the street to catch the bus. I remember having sleepovers and playdates with my cousin. Nene would take us to the gas station where she would buy us huge ice cream cones. That’s what I wanted my normal to be. I wanted to stay in her safe little bubble forever. But when you came and took me away, I never really felt safe again. Every time we moved to another house there was one of THOSE memories. I would do something, anything, like literally anything miniscule and it would irritate you and “give you anxiety.” Your mental illness was an excuse to take a belt to my face, throw me into a cupboard, choke me, push me up against bricks. Was that normal for you? I know you said Nene neglected you, but she was a single mother with three girls, and she couldn’t afford all the things you wanted. I want things too, but for now I have to be a mother to my brothers, fight suicidal thoughts, figure out how not to fear men, and try to sort out what normal means.\n\n“Campaign Speech”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Jared Goudsmit, Age 18\n\nDescription: Dean goes full populist in his bid for Class President.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nLook, I could talk credentials. I could tell you all about my experience in the JROTC. I could flex my Debate Club prowess. I could mention offhand that I am, in fact, an Eagle Scout. I could, but I won’t, because I’m not here to show off.\n\nNo, I’m here to talk about you. You get up every day before the sun rises. The bus is late. Your locker is jammed, the custodial staff couldn’t care less. Your desks are full of busywork, your lunch trays are full of mush, and your teachers are full of – you know, uh, nonsense. I say it time and time again: This whole operation, this machine they’re running you through, it has no interest in you.\n\nNow, I’ve pushed for reform! But when I try and do something to fix this place, I’m dismissed. “We are not hiring caterers, Dean, eat your casserole.” “Dean, the Anglerfish with a Missile Launcher is not an acceptable school mascot.” “Foolish Dean, the hallway is no place for a Slip ‘N Slide.” We’ve all heard it, in the same condescending tone, a million times before: “You’re just a child.” Well, po-tay-to, po-tah-to. You say I’m “just some kid,” I say I have fourteen years of life experience, thank you very much, and when I’m elected? I’ll stop at nothing to get you what you want.\n\nNow, my opponent has credentials. High class rank, Honor Society… every teacher’s favorite. Rose is a shoo-in, right? I see the appeal. I mean, she works like a, uh… oh, what’s the word? Right! A machine.\n\nSo go ahead. Vote for Rose… if you’re content. But if you’re fed up with the powers that be, if you’re sick and tired of being overlooked, if you want to see a Tammany Hall Junior High that reflects your needs… if you’re like me? Then Fight the Machine! And vote for Dean.\n\n“A Look into my Mirror”\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Gracyn Eitel, Age 14\n\nDescription: A Look into my Mirror\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nWhen I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t see my looks. I see the inside. You see, when I was little, I was a naughty troublemaker. But, like most children, I eventually learned from my parents how to be kind and loving. They taught me by their example. It was a happy childhood. I even had a horse! Every night Majestic and I would ride to where the sun touches the earth. I was devastated when he died. But losing him taught me that sometimes life is sad. It taught me how to grieve. When I got my first iPhone, I spent days glued to the screen. I didn’t even realize what I was missing out on. It took a while, but I finally decided to put the phone down and live in the real world. That’s when I learned to be social; To appreciate my friends and family. Then there was the time I was sitting in a classroom facing the chalkboard. The science teacher was teaching us about watersheds. I learned that creeks and rivers carve and shape their way, leading to a big body of water. This got me thinking about myself, and all the things that have shaped me; They are like the creeks and rivers of my life and I am that big body of water. My parents, Majestic, even my iPhone, have made me who I am today. I guess that’s how I’m able to look past my appearance. When I look in the mirror today, I see the inside. I see me.\n\n“Truth”\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Shirley Andoh, Age 16, Pennsylvania USA\n\nDescription: Claudia moves through emotions following an accident that is her fault.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nClaudia: (Yelling) I’m not going to tell the police what happened Jayla! Unlike you, I don’t want to go to jail. I’ve been trying to stay away from jail all my life and I’m not going to go there over something this dumb. You took care of her didn’t you? So there’s no need to tell the police anything. Almost my entire family has been in jail before and I want to be the one to set an example for my family’s next generation. (Breaks down and begs) Please don’t turn me in. I’m begging you Jayla. Please don’t turn me in. (Beat. No response from Jayla) You know what, do whatever. I’m tired of you acting all goody-two-shoes. I can’t be like you, and I don’t want to be like you anyway. But trust me, if you say anything to the police, I will never forgive you for that. It’s not like I intentionally hit her. Yes, I was driving but we were both drunk. (Consider ending the monologue here or continue through the end with Claudia taking responsibility.) I’m sorry Jayla. I will tell the police everything that happened. I know the right thing and I have to do it. Everyone has to face the consequences of their actions and I guess I have to face mine too, no matter what it may be. I’m sorry I gave you a hard time before.\n\n“A Word to the Living”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Sophia Blakely, Age 17\n\nFrom: Ontario, Canada\n\nDescription: A ghost of a soldier attempts to dissuade living soldiers from continuing to fight in what he believes to be a losing war.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\n[Austerely] Those men who still have their living wits about them, listen well to what I’m about to say. The world is cruel. That fact is without debate. [Scornfully] I have witnessed first-hand how vile men can act in times of war and tyranny – all in hopes of their survival, and possible glory. But that is strikingly less noble. I was not unfamiliar with traversing trenches – walking back and forth as the pools of mud tried to swallow me whole. I first maneuvered that path when I was younger than most of you are now. Though I’m not young anymore. Really, I’m not much of anything. [Dejectedly] It was an unfortunate thing to be my age in a war like that. If you fought well, you were guaranteed a spot in the next one. We all learned that lesson too late. [Dementedly] So, I’ll say this to you. If it’s glory you seek, go home. If it’s pride that’s keeping you here, go home. And, if it’s a life you want at the end of this, go home. Had I known better, I would have done the same. It bodes well to be a coward at a time like this. [Absently] Ah, but death is calling me back. How sweetly she beckons. Adieu. Adieu. Adieu…[Trails off]\n\n“I’ll Miss You Too”\n\nHonorary Mention\n\nBy: Alexandria Davidson, Age 16\n\nFrom: Ontario, Canada\n\nDescription: This piece is based on my real life experience as I parted realms with my late father, Jeffrey Alexander Davidson. It is told from my creatively augmented inner perspective. It is more of a spoken word piece than a monologue, so feel free to use creative movement, music, or multi-media in your performance.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\n“You’re stronger than I thought you were.”\n\nOh, I don’t think I’m strong. You though, you’ve been through so much. Yet people question why you continue to drink, and staggeringly, if you’re okay.\n\n“Stop asking if I’m okay.”\n\nIt makes you sad when someone asks if you’re okay. Because they know, and you know, you’re not. I accidentally did ask you one time. Your response still lingers in my mind, your smile.\n\n“I’m okay.”\n\nYou heard sniffles, under a poorly masked smile. I was trying to be strong for us.\n\n“Lexi, are you crying?”\n\nI was scared you weren’t going to be okay.\n\nOn a separate occasion, you were laying down, I was tickling your hair.\n\nI began to tear up, and you just opened your eyes and smiled.\n\nAll I could see was your beautiful blue eyes, and I was thankful I have the same ones.\n\n“He’s not going to make it to tomorrow”\n\nThere’s no way. We’re gonna go boating next summer. We talked about it. We’re gonna go tubing, all of us. He’s gonna be so excited to play games for real again, I got him an Xbox for Christmas, it’s in two days. We’re gonna play a lot of games again, like we used to. I’m gonna be moving into his apartment.\n\nWe’re\n\ngonna\n\nbe\n\ntogether.\n\n“You got that from me, you got that from me.”\n\nA chin-dimple I was insecure about when I was younger. I cried when you teased me for it, but it feels good to look in the mirror and see you. To look at my eyes and see your eyes. To drive the boat and to make new memories. To build a better future, with your name everywhere I go.\n\nWe were together. Those moments I’ll never forget, and they’ll always be ours.\n\n“Is That What You See?”\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Briana Rivera, Age 16, New York, USA\n\nDescription: Anita, a character from West Side Story is talking to her brother Bernardo. (Inspired by West Side Story but stands alone as a monologue.)\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nIs that what you see? Is that really how you feel? We have barely been here for a year and you wanna give up now? I can’t believe it. We grew up with so little money and you wanna go back? I know you think Puerto Rico is amazing, and it is, but we struggled so hard to make a living there. Sure, it was fun going to beaches and being with friends and having the time of our lives, but we can’t go back. It’s time to grow up and live a life we dreamed about. I wanna work at this design store and show people my talent, and you wanna run away? No! (angrily) We worked too damn hard to give up now! I don’t care if you don’t like it here, suck it up and deal with it. This isn’t just for us, it’s for our future. I regret having to leave our family but they’ll join us soon. You know that we need to do this, not only for us but for them too. Listen to me, we have never, ever had an opportunity like this before. We’ve never been given a chance to change how we live. Think about our siblings who are growing up how we did– is that what you want for them? To get bullied and called worthless– do you want that? I would regret that for the rest of my life if that ever happened. Stay. Please, I need you. They need you. We need you.\n\n“Mad Mockery”\n\nBy: Marina Paul, Age 16, Utah USA\n\nDescription: Mother Nature goes to therapy.\n\nGenre: Comedic/Dramatic\n\nWell. Here I am. Miss. Perfect, Miss. Pristine, Miss. Loving, Miss. Goddess, Miss. Ovaries for Days! I… uh…I’m not sure exactly where to start. It’s just that everywhere, all around me, all I see is dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! I mean it shouldn’t bother me, but it does and everything’s dead and everything’s hot and everything’s warming, and no one cares about Mother Nature. I keep this planet growing with my own two hands. But at this point is it even worth it? These humans are walking all over me like I’m their actual mother. Sometimes I think THEY should be the ones going to therapy, not me. When I first started this job, the grass was pristine. Crisp, cool, green, soft, forgiving. What is it now? Dry as a whistle. If I wanted my grass to be used for a whistle, I would have made it a whistle. You know another thing? The sky used to be blue. Yeah. B-L-U-E blue. I miss those days. It used to be so blue you could actually see the clouds. Now it’s grey. I hate grey. I don’t know. Maybe we should let the greenhouse gas emissions just wipe me out. Then see how they like it. They asked for the purge they’re gonna get the purge. Oh! And you know what else really gets my vines in a twist? Sea levels. That’s not even on me, I stay hydrated. Those guys down there? Well, just between you and me, they could use another shower. Sorry folks, it’s not gonna start raining men until that water goes down. (Pause) Can I think of anything good? Uh…well I like the stars…that is when I can see them. Maybe I just need glasses. No that can’t be it. Sorry – what was that? The session’s almost over? Well, I guess there’s one thing that I really do need to talk about. Do you know how to reverse climate change? I might have gotten a little heated.\n\n“Sister Parent”\n\nBy: Audrey Cherwinski, Age 16, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nDescription: A teen expresses anger at needing to share her room with a baby sister but decides to rise to the occasion because her mom was never a real mom.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nYou’re telling me I have to share my room? This is outrageous. You know we live in a two-bedroom apartment, yet you still decided to get pregnant. Thank you for being so considerate, mom! I’m turning thirteen next month which means I’m basically a teenager. And what do teenagers need? Oh yeah…privacy! This just isn’t fair. None of my other friends have to share a room, and none of them have a mother like you. You don’t care about me, and you’re never there when I need you. Where were you when I needed help with my math homework? Why weren’t you there to make me dinner when I was too young to use the stove? Oh yeah-I remember now. You were too busy running around with guys that only stuck around for one reason and one reason only. Which one of them banged you up this time? Was it Carl? John? Someone I haven’t met yet?!? Is he going to watch the baby, change their diaper, feed them? No, he isn’t, and neither are you. You and I both know I’m going to be responsible for this child I didn’t even ask for. (Pauses to collect herself and changes tactics.) But you know what? I’m up for the challenge. I WILL share my room, but most importantly, I’ll give that kid the childhood I never got to have. As soon as I can get a job, I’ll use the money from my paychecks to spoil them with all the coolest toys on the market. I’ll make them feel loved. Make time for them. Give them everything you didn’t give me.\n\nThe Monster Under My Bed\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Sarah McCroan, Age 15, Georgia, USA\n\nDescription: A young person struggles with the ugliness of the world.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to be afraid of the monster under my bed. I’d toss and turn all night, afraid that one day it would take me! For years just the thought of it gave me nightmares. But as I got older, I let go of that fear…or so I thought. When I started middle school, I was bullied for my “fascination” with insects. My dad is an entomologist, so he got me interested at a young age. This “fascination” earned me the nickname “Roach Girl” after I caught a roach during class. That’s when I realized that the monsters aren’t under my bed, they are all around me. And in high school, the bullying got worse. The monsters there would attack you for the smallest thing like staring too long, not giving homework answers, or even just saying no. I’m surprised most people can’t see through their hand-crafted disguises. Those painted on faces, fake smiles, and pretend emotions are all designed to fool you into thinking they’re good. You know, the kind of monster that records a fight rather than breaking it up? The ones that have no shame hurting people. I thought I could fight back to expose them. I mean the world would be better without them, right? I tried to fight fire with fire, but there are too many. So, I gave up. For months I felt like a failure, and I couldn’t sleep. Then one night it happened again. I felt that old urge to check under my bed. I was horrified by what I saw- a nearly perfect figure of myself, but the image twisted. It was awful looking and had teeth that could bite someone in half. That’s when I realized that monsters truly are everywhere. They are all around me because I was one too. I am the monster under my bed.\n\nWatch a video performance of this monologue here!\n\nSpace Unicorns\n\nThird Place Winner!\n\nBy: Jayla and Selene, Age 13, New South Wales, Australia\n\nDescription: An astronaut gives a rather enlightening talk about space.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\n(Astronaut enters, tripping and staggering) Sorry, sorry, my legs are still getting use to gravity. Thank you for coming to my seminar on “Gallivanting through the Asteroid Cosmonaut Magnitude of Outer Planets through Orbit.” For the kiddies out there… SPAAAACE! To get to space, first I had to go seventeen-thousand-five-hundred miles per hour. Or FAAAAST! And it’s very cold in space-brrrr! It’s minus two hundred and seventy degrees Celsius! Lucky my granny knitted me a warm jumper! And let’s not forget about the leg warmers! She was like … (Turns dramatically to the side, lowers glasses and hunches over, shaking a finger, mimicking granny.) “You young whipper-snippers don’t know how lucky you are! Back in the day, if we wanted to go to space, we had to build our own rocket ship. We weren’t given one by NASA.” (Straightens up again) A lot of people think I went to space to explore the planets, but I was just trying to escape my old granny! Next thing I know, I’m working for NASA. Lucky, I liked the suit! (Holding up a real rock, or pantomimed rock.) Here’s a memento I brought back from space. You’ll know it’s from space because it’s labelled “space rock”. You bet that I’ll be selling this on eBay for millions! But we don’t want people putting googly eyes on it and turning it into a pet rock, so I think I’ll keep it. (Drops rock on foot, hops around, clutching his toes.) Shi-Schnitzel with gravy! Schnitzel with gravy! Sorry, I keep forgetting I’m on Earth, where gravity exists. Since returning home, I’ve dropped eggs, the family dog… I’ve even dropped a mic, not on purpose though. Wasn’t even saying anything clever … Anyway, why I’m here today is no laughing matter. I’m here because when I was in space, I saw a massive group of unicorns flying with swords in their mouths. NASA says hallucinations are simply a side effect of being in space, like when astronauts report seeing streaks of light that come from nowhere. NASA says they are just cosmic rays-tiny particles launched by the explosions of distant stars-But I say they are UNICORNS! And because NASA doesn’t believe me, or they think I ate too many Mars bars and am lacking oxygen, they’ve dismissed it. BUT I’M TELLING YOU, I SAW THEM! WITH THEIR MASSIVE HORNS! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE PEOPLE! THEY’RE COMING FOR US! (Disorientated, lies on the ground, trying to run away, makes a dramatic exit.)\n\nSorry\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Thato Sibuyi, Age 17, Haenertsburg, South Africa\n\nDescription: Amy and her team just lost a competition that had a large amount of prize money. Amy really needed that money.\n\nGenre: Dramatic\n\nSORRY? (Hysterical laughter) Sorry? Really that’s all you have to say? We just lost thousands of dollars and you’re sorry? (Angry) No. You don’t get to be sorry. You don’t care, not enough to be sorry. You did this competition for fun, and the prize money was just the cherry on top for you. I put my life on the line for this! You go home to a big house, with working lights and food on the table. I’m going to go home to a two-bedroom house and pray to God we have enough to pay for the electric bill. The bill that I was supposed to pay for with the money that I was supposed to win from this competition. (Angrily) And you want to know why we lost, Jack? Because of you! You and Lisa going at each other’s necks the whole time! You couldn’t set your pride aside for two hours? TWO HOURS for the greater good of everyone else, but no! That didn’t work for you, did it? (Starts crying) I did everything, EVERYTHING in my power to win this, and all my efforts were wasted. You’re not sorry. Not for losing this, you’re okay, you lost nothing. You just feel bad because some of us really cared, and that’s not sorry, that’s pity. And I don’t need that from you. So don’t tell me you’re sorry, cause I’m not buying it.\n\nWatch a video performance of this monologue here!\n\nWatch another video performance of this monologue here!\n\nShrimp Fried Rice\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Jeremiah Reid, Age 16, North Carolina, USA\n\nDescription: A person who takes things a little too literally gets quite upset when their date orders shrimp fried rice.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nWoah, woah, woah! Hold on just a minute here waiter. I wasn’t gonna say anything before, because I’m no marine biologist, but if she (gestures across) is gonna order that, I’m gonna have to speak up. Now, when I saw it on the menu I did some research, and I am fairly certain there is no way that is possible. I mean, shrimp? Frying rice? The very concept is preposterous! There are a million issues I can think of! There is no way shrimp could get their tiny little hands on the frying pan, and I don’t think they have the brain capacity to know when rice is done cooking. On top of that, there has to be a health code violation here! I mean, it says on the menu: “warning: consumption of raw meat or poultry may cause food poisoning,” but it doesn’t say anything about consumption of food prepared by meat or poultry! (Turns across) Look, I’m gonna be honest. I was fully prepared to propose to you tonight. I have the ring and everything! But if you are seriously going to give in to the delusions of this restaurant and order “shrimp fried rice,” I don’t think I can anymore. In fact, I think we should see other people.\n\nThis is false advertisement, and I will not, no, CAN not stand for it! Can you imagine walking into the kitchen to see an army of little crustaceans manning the grill? It’s insane! It’s delusional! The only explanation I can think of is a sort of ratatouille situation, where there’s a shrimp controlling the human cooking the food, but if that’s the case the shrimp certainly shouldn’t be mentioned in the name of the dish! I mean what’s next, “manta ray steamed vegetables?” Oh OK, now I’m “causing a scene?” You know what’s causing a scene? THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SHRIMP PREPARING FOOD! I can’t take this tomfoolery anymore; I’m taking my business elsewhere! Good day to you sir, but a terrible day to whoever decided to claim shrimp could cook! (Storms offstage)\n\nBrunch\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Jack Lassman, Age 13, New York, USA\n\nDescription: Sharon, a mother from Savannah, Georgia, speaks to her group of friends.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nHello girls! How are we? Great! Glad to hear it. Melissa, how are your girls? Wonderful. Barb, how is Dave? Sorry, I meant how is he for you? Does he make you happy? Does he make your kids happy? Does he have a good job? Because I have a list of perfect matches for you if you ever need to take a gander. No? Okay. Well girls, today has already been the craziest day of my life. After I woke up and got the kids fed, I went to get ready for today’s brunch. Well, I walked into the bathroom to do my lady things and after I came out, I noticed something on my blanket. Yes, the Versace one. Naturally, I went to investigate and saw a sight so horrific I might never recover. What was it you ask? It was a big, green frog! I know! I grabbed the nearest object and smashed that little stinker till he was flatter than Flat Stanley himself. Now hold on, why are you girls suddenly so angry? I shouldn’t have smashed it? Well I didn’t enjoy smashing it. I mean, the frog was asking for it. If you lay one of your webbed fingers on my Versace blanket, you better prepare to be smashed with my stilettos. Of course I love animals. Just not on my stuff. The relationship I have with animals is the same as the one with my dear husband. I love you, just keep your distance and we won’t have any altercations. I’m not going to put the frog in a cup. Those cups are worth 50 dollars each and Rob worked very hard so I could afford them. I can’t have Kayley-Anne drinking out of a frog-infested cup. She’d die. I read that on Facebook. Well girls, I cannot believe y’all have turned on me like this. You are looking at me like I’m some murderer. The beast came into my home and ruined my stuff. I’m not to give it some food and water, and send it off with a coupon for a free spa-day. Barbara if you found a spider in your daughter’s room you would not hesitate to smash that creeper. Melissa, if you found a mouse in your home you would set up a mousetrap for sure. So why am I such a monster for smashing a frog that entered my home and crawled on my belongings. On that note, I brought some champagne so we could make mimosas, but I forgot to bring orange juice. Silly old me. I did remember to bring the glasses though so drink up because whatever we don’t drink, Robert will.\n\nMiss Fortune\n\nFirst Place Winner!\n\nBy: Marina Paul, Age 15, Utah USA\n\nDescription: After aspiring for it her whole life, Missy Lewis has just won the title of “Miss Fortune.” She is now being questioned about the mysterious injuries to the other contestants.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nAll right, let’s get one thing straight Mr. Brown. I wouldn’t just go around murdering my competition like I was on a hunt for Black Friday bargains and clearance bin steals? Who would enter such a competition and then murder someone just ensure their victory? As this sash was laid upon me I swore to uphold the standards of “Miss Fortune”. I took a vow of charity, kindness and beauty. If you ask any of the girls they would tell you of my beauty, my kindness and my charity. Yes, I understand all the girls are in shock, or admitted to the hospital because the…but you can imagine that’s how they would all respond. When I became Miss Fortune I promised myself that I would always look at each contestant through the eyes of a girl who’s desperate shyness hides her opulent confidence to take control and get what she wants. I mean Mr. Brown, how could someone as innocent and beautiful as me grab a green knife handle and…Oh, I could never stoop to that level of foul play Mr. Brown. Miss Fortune is not a title that I take lightly. If I have to answer that then I’ll take my sash, and my baton and I’ll leave. Oh right, I can’t. Miss Fortune would never strike at a time when another contestant was supposedly answering a question about what they would supposedly do if they won the supposed title…and the entire audience was in tears about her heartwarming answer. Where was I? Well, I just happened to be in the booth cheering on my sister contestants. You see, if I was in the light booth, then there was no way I could have run down the stairs until I reached the stage and found the knife stashed in a lock box by the rigging system roughly 25 feet away from Alice. And there is certainly no way that I could have used the knife as she completed her double turn leading her offstage directly into a vegetable patterned cutting knife. I was in heels after all. Can I have my heels back now, Mr. Brown? I realize they’re a little stained but isn’t that just the sort of thing that happens as you use them? How dare you make such an accusation about an impressionable high school junior Mr. Brown! I’ve worked to the bone for this school, and this title, and I’ll work to clear my name until the blood of all past and present Miss Fortunes runs in the street and stains my heels…you believe me don’t you?\n\nBook Cleanse\n\nSecond Place Winner!\n\nBy: Avani Ingole, Age 14, New Jersey USA\n\nDescription: A book nerd decides it’s time to take a break from reading about heroes and heroines and start having some adventures of her own.\n\nGenre: Comedic\n\nI never noticed how much space books take up–in my head and in my actual room. I mean, it’s kind of sad. I didn’t think I relied on fictional characters this "
