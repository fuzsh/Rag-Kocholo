You can create stories to tell a data narrative, provide context, demonstrate how decisions relate to outcomes, or to simply make a compelling case.\n\nA story is a sheet, so the methods you use to create, name, and manage worksheets and dashboards also apply to stories (for more details, see Workbooks and Sheets). At the same time, a story is also a collection of sheets, arranged in a sequence. Each individual sheet in a story is called a story point.\n\nWhen you share a story âfor example, by publishing a workbook to Tableau Public, Tableau Server, or Tableau Cloudâusers can interact with the story to reveal new findings or ask new questions of the data."
