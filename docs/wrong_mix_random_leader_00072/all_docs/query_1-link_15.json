        "text": "by Win Scott Eckert\n\nThe Wold Newton meteor event - artwork by Lisa Eckert\n\nA Listing of Philip José Farmer's Wold Newton works\n\nThe primary Wold Newton works are Philip José Farmer's two literary \"biographies,\" Tarzan Alive, Doubleday 1972, Popular Library 1976, Playboy Paperbacks 1981, and Bison Books 2006; and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life, Doubleday 1973, Bantam Books 1975 and Playboy Paperbacks 1981.\n\nThe new edition of TARZAN ALIVE is now listed on the Bison Books website\n\nMore cover images: Tarzan AliveDoc Savage\n\nBeyond Tarzan Alive and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life, Mr. Farmer further expanded on his Wold Newton mythology in several novels and short stories or articles:\n\nThe Adventure of the Peerless Peer, by John H. Watson, M.D. The hardback (below) was published Aspen Press, 1974; paperback Dell, 1976. Due to copyright concerns, Farmer was forced to remove Tarzan from this novel when it was republished as \"The Adventure of the Three Madmen\" in the anthology The Grand Adventure, Berkley Books, 1984. (The paperback cover appears on the Crossover Chronology, Part VI page.)\n\n\"After King Kong Fell,\" found in The Grand Adventure, Berkley Books, 1984.\n\nDoc Savage: Archenemy of Evil, a screenplay by Farmer for the second, and unmade, Doc Savage feature film.\n\n\"The Doge Whose Barque Was Worse Than His Bight,\" a Ralph von Wau Wau tale by Jonathan Swift Somers III in Fantasy & Science Fiction, November 1976.\n\nEscape From Loki, Bantam Books, 1991. (Young Doc Savage's first adventure.)\n\n\"An Exclusive Interview with Lord Greystoke,\" found in The Book of Philip José Farmer, DAW Books, 1973; revised edition Berkley Books, 1982.\n\n\"Extracts from the Memoirs of Lord Greystoke,\" found in Mother Was a Lovely Beast, Pyramid Books, 1976.\n\n\"The Freshman,\" a Cthulhu Mythos story found in The Book of Philip José Farmer, Berkley Books, 1982.\n\nHadon of Ancient Opar and Flight to Opar, DAW Books, 1974 and 1976. More cover images: Hadon of OparFlight to Opar\n\nIroncastle, J.H. Rosny, translated and retold in English by Farmer, who adds some Wold Newton connections, DAW Books, 1976. Cover images.\n\n\"The Last Rise of Nick Adams,\" found in The Book of Philip José Farmer, Berkley Books, 1982.\n\n\"The Obscure Life and Hard Times of Kilgore Trout,\" a short biographical sketch found in The Book of Philip José Farmer, DAW Books, 1973; revised edition Berkley Books, 1982.\n\nOne of the few known photographs of the elusive Kilgore Trout, c. 1974\n\nThe Other Log of Phileas Fogg, Tor Books, 1982 (original publication date 1973). More cover images.\n\n\"The Problem of the Sore Bridge - Among Others,\" by Harry \"Bunny\" Manders found in Riverworld and Other Stories, published by Berkley Books, 1979; and Sherlock Holmes Through Time and Space, edited by Issac Asimov, Martin Greenberg, and Charles Waugh, Bluejay Books, 1984.\n\n\"A Scarletin Study,\" a Ralph von Wau Wau tale by Jonathan Swift Somers III found in Sherlock Holmes Through Time and Space, edited by Issac Asimov, Martin Greenberg, and Charles Waugh, Bluejay Books, 1984.\n\n\"Skinburn,\" found in The Book of Philip José Farmer, DAW Books, 1973; revised edition Berkley Books, 1982. (An adventure of Kent Lane, the son of The Shadow and Margo Lane.)\n\n(The Shadow - artwork by Lisa Eckert)\n\nStations of the Nightmare (Leo Queequeeg Tincrowder, a Wold Newton Family member and cousin of Kilgore Trout, is a supporting character.)\n\nTarzan: The Dark Heart of Time, Del Rey Books, 1999.\n\nTime's Last Gift, Del Rey Books, 1972; revised edition 1977. (Note that the abbreviation of this title, TLG, gives a hint as to who the main character really is - Tarzan, Lord Greystoke.) More cover images.\n\nVenus on the Half-Shell, Dell Books, 1974. (This book, written by Wold Newton Family member Kilgore Trout, mentions Jonathan Swift Somers III and his epic biographies of Ralph von Wau Wau, making it one possible future of the Wold Newton Universe.) More cover images.\n\n\"The Volcano,\" a short story by Paul Chapin found in Riverworld and Other Stories, Berkley Books, 1979. (Writer Paul Chapin once met Wold Newton Family member Nero Wolfe, in Goodwin and Stout's The League of Frightened Men. In The Volcano, private detective Curtius Parry works with a reporter named Edward Malone. This is likely the same Malone from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger stories.)\n\nThe Wind Whales of Ishmael, 1971. (While Mr. Farmer makes no explicit Wold Newton connection in this sequel to Herman Melville's Moby Dick, later research has established that the events of Moby Dick do take place in the Wold Newton Universe. Therefore I feel justified in including Mr. Farmer's sequel in this list.) More cover images.\n\nThe World of Tiers series. (A Wold Newton Family member, Paul Janus \"Kickaha\" Finnegan, is one of the main characters in this series.)\n\nFinally, there are several Wold Newton articles by Mr. Farmer which appeared in various journals or fanzines. They, along with Mr. Farmer's original Wold Newton Family Trees, are reproduced on this website with Mr. Farmer's permission.\n\nWold Newton or Not?\n\nWhile the following certainly draw on Wold Newton mythology, whether or not they fit into Mr. Farmer's regular Wold Newton continuity is up for debate. Certainly they deserve honorable mention here. As Mr. Farmer has said, \"Let the reader decide\":\n\nA Feast Unknown, Lord of the Trees, and The Mad Goblin. (Three novels featuring the battle of Lord Grandrith (a Tarzan analogue) and Doc Caliban (a Doc Savage analogue) against the Nine. Dennis Power has written three tremendous articles which reconcile these novels with Wold Newton Universe continuity: Triple Tarzan Tangle, TARZAN? JANE?, and Tarzans in the Valley of Gold. More cover images: A Feast UnknownLord of the Trees The Mad Goblin\n\nGreatheart Silver, Tor Books, 1982. (The main factor against including this collection of three short stories in the Wold Newton Universe is an episode in which many of the great pulp heroes, now aged, engage in a massive gun battle and are killed off. Brad Mengel's excellent Fakeout at Shootout resolves these events with Wold Newton continuity and also discusses the Grandrith/Caliban books. Art Bollmann also tackles Greatheart Silver in his superb The Greatheart Silver Problem.)\n\nA Barnstormer in Oz, Berkley Books, 1982. (Mr. Farmer gives Oz the reality twist. One factor that may argue against including this book in the Wold Newton Universe is that all sequels to L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz are treated as fictional, except for this one. On the other hand, Dennis Power has written Ozdyssey, or How the Yellow Brick Road Lead Me to the Riverworld, explaining how Mr. Farmer's book could fit in.\n\nBACK TO MAIN PAGE\n\nSITE NAVIGATION\n\nThe Wold Newton Universe site was created for the sole purposes of entertainment and information.\n\nAll rights reserved.
