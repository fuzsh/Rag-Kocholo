        "text": "Hi Bala- Welcome to the Atlassian Community!\n\nWe recently did this. You need to go into the issue type hierarchy, and they rename the Epic to Feature.\n\nThen go to your list of issue, types, and their rename Epic to Feature.\n\nWhile you were there, create a new issue type called Epic\n\nNow return to the issue type hierarchy and add the Epic as level two.\n\nHi @bala katabathuni\n\nwelcome to the community!\n\nJust to add to John's answer, there's two things to consider:\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Jira's issue type hierarchy allows additional levels only in Jira Premium.\n\nThere are certain semantics associated with issue level \"#1\" (by default called Epic), e.g. in how such issues are displayed in the Jira Software backlog view, etc. So while it is possible (and not uncommon) to rename level #1, just be mindful that it may become confusing to others if you create another hierarchy level - e.g., a level #2 - and call this other hierarchy level \"Epic\".\n\nThese are really just things to consider. As John said, it is absolutely possible to model your hierarchy in Jira Premium.\n\nJust as food for thought, another option would of course be to use issue links. Issue links give you full flexibility on how you connect two issues to each other, and don't require Jira Premium. The downside is that Jira doesn't really \"recognise\" issue links as parent/child relationships - there are, however, various hierarchy-focused apps on the Atlassian Marketplace that can do so. I'm happy to elaborate if this is an option for you.\n\nBest,\n\nHannes\n\nHi @bala katabathuni\n\nJira Premium is a license for Jira that enables certain additional features; you can find more information here. The features that utilises hierarchy the most are so-called plans. Plugins (also known as apps) typically work with any Jira license (be it Free, Standard, or Premium), and depending on the app and the size of your site, may either be free or paid. As said, there are a number of hierarchy-focused apps available - as you can trial any app for free for one month, I'd recommend to try a few and see which one works best for you.\n\nTo provide a concrete recommendation: My team and I work on an app that I feel might be useful to you, JXL for Jira.\n\nJXL is a full-fledged spreadsheet/table view for your issues that allows viewing, inline-editing, sorting, and filtering by all your issue fields, much like youâ€™d do in e.g. Excel or Google Sheets. It also comes with a number of advanced features, including support for (configurable) issue hierarchies. These issue hierarchies can be based on Jira's built-in parent/child relationships (like task/sub-task, or epic/story), and/or based on issue links of configurable issue link types.\n\nThis is how this looks in action:\n\nI'm using an epic/story/task/sub-task hierarchy here, but you could also model epic/feature/story/sub-task. Stories and tasks are connected to each other via issue links.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBest,\n\nHannes\n\nHi @bala katabathuni\n\nWelcome to the community !!\n\nIf you are on Jira premium, you can create hierarchy levels above Epic. However on other Jira version, you can use issue links to create your own hierarchy at any level. If you would like to try out a mktplace app, please take a look at an add-one have developed for the same use case.\n\nIssue Hierarchy\n\nThe app shows your issues , their subtasks and the linked issues as well in a simple and easy to use tree view, with progress at each parent level.\n\nDisclaimer : I am part of the team which developed this app"
