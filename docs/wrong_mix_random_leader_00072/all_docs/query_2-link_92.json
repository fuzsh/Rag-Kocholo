        "text": "Thanks @Bill Sheboy for responding. Actually I was thinking that if Estimation features itself is disabled (in Project settings -> Features) then, user should not be able to see the Story Point field and Original Estimate field at all.\n\n@Walter Buggenhout sorry to pull you here out of no where. But can you please help ? :)\n\nHi @011_avinash,\n\nToggling the estimation feature on/off does normally indeed add/remove the story points or original estimate field.\n\nHowever, nothing prevents you or another project admin to manually add the same fields to your issue type screens. I have been able to reproduce that scenario myself by disabling the estimation feature, but then manually adding the fields to the screen associated with an issue type.\n\nThat is most likely what happened in your case as well. Enabling the estimation feature would normally enable the story point estimate OR original estimate field, not both.\n\nSo, as @Bill Sheboy mentioned, just navigate to project settings / issue types and remove the fields from the screen. That should make them disappear."
