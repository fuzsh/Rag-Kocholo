This is the full list of all previously featured texts.\n\nJuly 15, 2024: Celebrating Ernest Hemingway’s Legacy\n\nIn the month of July, fans of Ernest Hemingway gather in Key West, Florida for the annual Hemingway Days. This event honours the legacy of this American writer who lived on the island for many years. There are literary events as well as ones related to the author’s many passions, including deep-sea angling. There is even a Hemingway look-alike contest!\n\nErnest Hemingway (1899-1961) is remembered for notable works such as A Farewell to Arms, The Sun Also Rises and The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have a large number of Hemingway’s works. You can find many of his novels, short stories and nonfiction writing here. If you would like to join us to help bring more public domain titles like these to Canada, please visit our companion site Distributed Proofreaders Canada for more information.\n\nJuly 1, 2024: Canada Day\n\nCanada Day, July 1, is the national day of Canada. A federal statutory holiday, it celebrates the anniversary of Canadian Confederation which occurred on July 1, 1867, with the passing of the British North America Act, 1867, when the three separate colonies of the United Canadas, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick were united into a single dominion within the British Empire called Canada. Originally called Dominion Day, it became an official public holiday in 1879. “Ode for Dominion Day”, a poem published anonymously in 1879, appeared that year in support of the holiday inauguration. The holiday was later renamed Canada Day in 1982.\n\nWe offer other works on the Confederation including The Fighting-Slogan and The Fathers of Confederation, A Chronicle of the Birth of the Dominion (Chronicles of Canada #28). Come join us and proof a few pages to help us bring more public domain titles like these to Canada. More information about volunteering is available on our companion site Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nJune 15, 2024: Orlando: A Biography by Virginia Woolf\n\nTo celebrate Pride Month, we offer again an article first printed on January 15, 2018.\n\nVirginia Woolf is a celebrated novelist and essayist, who was one of the first of the Modernist writers to use the stream-of-consciousness technique. We celebrate Woolf’s birthday on January 25 by presenting Orlando: A Biography, first published on 11 October 1928. One of Woolf’s most popular novels, this story takes a satiric look at the history of English literature while featuring the adventures of Orlando, a poet who changes sex over the centuries. This book has an important place in feminist and transgender literature. It is inspired by Vita Sackville-West, a writer whose own poetry and novels we feature here at Faded Page and with whom Woolf had a romantic relationship.\n\nWe offer other works by Virginia Woolf, including the well-known feminist essay, “A Room of One’s Own”, the novel The Waves and the collection, A Haunted House and Other Short Stories. Come join us and proof a few pages to help us bring more public domain titles like these to Canada.

Phillips Oppenheim (1866-1946) was a novelist who wrote 39 volumes of short stories and 116 novels mainly of suspense and international intrigue. He is generally regarded as the earliest writer of spy fiction as we know it today, and, invented the “Rogue Male” school of adventure thrillers that was later exploited by other authors like John Buchan.\n\nThe World’s Great Snare is our latest offering from Oppenheim. This mystery, published in 1900, starts off at a Sierra Nevada gold mining camp, and has its protagonist Bryan searching for information about his past. The story was made into a 1916 silent film.\n\nIn addition to The World’s Great Snare, we have many more Oppenheim titles of suspense and short stories. These can be found in our Special Collection: The Works of E. Phillips Oppenheim. If you would like to help us fill out our Oppenheim collection, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Forester\n\n(A repeat of our April 1, 2017 featured text.)\n\nC.S. (Cecil Scott) Forester (1899-1966) was an English novelist known for writing tales of naval warfare such as the 11-book Horatio Hornblower saga, depicting a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic wars. Two of the Hornblower books, A Ship of the Line and Flying Colours, were jointly awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1938. His other works include The African Queen (adapted to film in 1951 by John Huston).\n\nIn Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, the first volume of the saga, we meet Horatio Hornblower, a young man of 17, beginning his career in January 1794 as an inexperienced midshipman in the British Navy fighting against Napoleon and his tyranny of Europe. Bullied and forced into a duel, he takes an even chance. Later, he has many more chances to show his skills and ingenuities: from sailing a ship full of wetted and swelling rice to imprisonment and saving the lives of shipwrecked sailors. Along the way, he fights galleys, feeds cattle, stays out of the way of the guillotine, and makes friends with a Duchess. He becomes a man and develops the strength of character which will make him a hero to his men, and to all England.\n\nWe now have 41 C.S. Forester titles on Faded Page including the 11 Hornblower volumes. Come join us and proof a few pages to help us bring other public domain titles to Canada.

For many in the path of totality, this was a once-in-a-lifetime event. The eclipse had a significant impact on the tourism industry in various parts of North America, and it also led to great interest in the science, history, literature and mythology surrounding eclipses and the sun.\n\nWith advances in astronomy and astronomical equipment, we now have a good understanding of the sun. Eclipses can be predicted far in advance and, these days, are celebrated as momentous experiences that offer teaching opportunities. However, what did earlier civilizations think of the sun? How much did they know of the science related to it? How did they explain the sun’s movements?\n\nSun Lore of All Ages by William Tyler Olcott describes the mythology and folklore surrounding the sun from various periods in history and different parts of the world. Worship of the sun is part of many civilizations’ history, as it plays such an important role in a person’s life. The book includes photographs of paintings, sculptures and monuments related to this worship, such as the accompanying photograph of the gateway of Ptolemy III Euergetes at Karnak.\n\nWilliam Tyler Olcott (1873-1936) was an American lawyer and amateur astronomer. After attending a talk by well-known astronomer Edward Pickering, he became greatly interested in variable stars, and in 1911, he and Pickering founded the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Olcott wrote several other books that helped to popularize the field of astronomy.\n\nIf you like what we do, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Commissioned by the OSS (now CIA) in 1945, it was intended to help America and its Allies understand Japanese culture for post-war business and diplomatic relations.\n\nPrior to World War II, State Shinto was deeply embedded in Japanese national identity and governance. It was not just a religion, but also a state ideology that emphasized imperial worship and nationalism. After Japan’s surrender in 1945, the Allies, led by the United States, initiated several reforms to dismantle the militaristic and imperial aspects of Japanese society. A key part of this process was the disestablishment of State Shinto. This involved removing Shinto’s influence from government and education, thereby separating religion from state affairs.\n\nThe Chrysanthemum and the Sword played a pivotal role in this transitional period. It explored the dichotomy within Japanese culture--the aesthetic and pacifist qualities symbolized by the chrysanthemum, contrasted with the martial values represented by the sword. Benedict’s work helped American policymakers and businessmen understand the complexities of Japanese society, including its religious and ethical systems and its values and social norms. It highlighted the cultural divide in how guilt and shame are perceived and managed in eastern societies versus western societies. Understanding these differences was considered crucial for implementing reforms and for establishing future diplomatic and business relationships.\n\nIf you like what we do, come join us and proofread a few pages.

With the advent of Prohibition and organized crime in the 1920’s in the U.S. and Canada, a new literary genre of private-eye fiction known as hardboiled fiction developed. Short stories in pulp fiction magazines like Black Mask became popular and capitalized on publishing violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Authors adopted this new private-eye detective genre and “hardboiled” became a literary subgenre in the 1930’s with Dashiell Hammett’s detective character, Sam Spade.\n\nAlthough hardboiled (detective) fiction shares some of its characters and settings with crime fiction, it has a detective protagonist who battles the violence of organized crime while dealing with a legal system as corrupt as the organized criminals. The detective, made cynical of the cycle of violence and corruption, is often the antihero. Notable hardboiled detectives include Dick Tracy, Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe, Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer; and Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade, Nick Charles, and The Continental Op.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have ten Philip Marlowe books beginning with The Big Sleep and Farewell My Lovely. Sam Spade appears in The Adventures of Sam Spade and Other Stories and The Maltese Falcon, while Nick Charles is featured in The Thin Man. The Continental Op is featured in four titles: The Dain Curse, Red Harvest, and short stories “One Hour\" and “The Gatewood Caper\"\n\nIf you like what we do, come join us and proofread a few pages. For more information, check out our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: Dorothy Richardson\n\nOn March 8, we celebrated International Women’s Day, with a 2024 theme of “Inspire Inclusion”. A worthy writer to consider in light of this event is British author and journalist Dorothy Richardson (1873-1957). Richardson was one of the earliest modernist writers to use the stream-of-consciousness technique in her writing. She is considered a feminist author because of the emphasis she put on women’s experiences and the feminine point-of-view.\n\nRichardson’s best known work is Pilgrimage, a sequence of 13 novels published between 1915 and 1967. The work follows the life of Miriam Henderson, and her story is based, to a large extent, on Richardson’s own life. The first 6 volumes of Pilgrimage can be found here at Project Gutenberg, a site similar to this one but following US rather than Canadian public-domain rules. Volumes 7 through 13 can be found here at Faded Page.\n\nWe invite you to join us as a volunteer. By proofreading just a few pages, you can help us make more public-domain books like Dorothy Richardson’s novels available to readers. For more information, check out our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nMarch 1, 2024: Famous Literary Families\n\nOn February 19, the annual Family Day holiday was celebrated in a number of Canadian provinces. As we take time to appreciate our own families, we can also consider the famous families that appear in literature.\n\nThere are many families that appear in juvenile series. These include a number from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, such as the two sets of fraternal twins, Nan, Bert, Freddie and Flossie in The Bobbsey Twins, brothers Frank and Joe in The Hardy Boys and sisters Jean and Louise is The Dana Girls. Many of Enid Blyton’s books feature families, including the popular series, The Famous Five. This series involves the adventures of three siblings, a cousin and the family dog.\n\nSome families featured in our collection are real ones. The story of the famous pioneering Ingalls family was told by Laura Ingalls Wilder in her Little House series starting with Little House in the Big Woods. The image is an illustration by Helen Sewell depicting Laura and her sisters Mary and Carrie. The history of the Plantagenet kings of England is told in Thomas B. Costain’s 4-volume nonfiction series, starting with The Conquering Family.\n\nNot all family stories are happy ones. Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina opens with “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Costain’s saga shows family members warring not just with foreign invaders but amongst themselves. Another notable dysfunctional family can be found in William Faulker’s works. The trials of the Compson family are described in works such as The Sound and the Fury\n\nWhich literary family is your favourite? If the book is in Canada’s public domain and you don’t see it on our site, consider joining us as a volunteer to help us expand our collection. For more information, check out our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nFebruary 15, 2024: The New Canadian Public Domain Rules\n\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) was founded in 2007 by Michael Shepard and David Jones to support the digitization of public domain books. The main principles of our mission are to: (1) preserve Canadiana, one page at a time, (2) take advantage of the favourable copyright laws in Canada to make books written by authors who are in the public domain—that is, currently out of copyright in Canada—more available to the public.\n\nUp until December 30, 2022, copyright of a work by an author was limited to 50 years from the end of the calendar year of the author’s death. As of January 1, 2023, this was changed to 70 years from the end of the calendar year of death. Therefore, all the work of any author who died during 1971 or before is in the public domain.\n\nFor authors who died in 1972, the new rule applies. Works by authors who died in 1972 will not be in the public domain until 2043.The law was not made retroactive which means that any author who was in the public domain stays in the public domain.\n\nAs an example, George Herbert Sallans, a Canadian journalist, died in 1960, so his books are in the public domain. Unfortunately, J. R. R. Tolkien, who wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, among many other books, died in 1973. DPC will not be able to publish his books until 2044.\n\nHere is the reason why Canada’s Copyright Act was amended. In September 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada reached an agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA. The new law involved only small changes. One was to the Canadian Copyright Act which was amended to change author copyright protections from 50 years to 70 years among other amendments.\n\nIf you wish to see more details about Canadian copyright rules, you can check out A guide to copyright produced by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.\n\nSo, sadly, this means that we are constrained in which books we can offer you on Faded Page. But be heartened to know that there are literally thousands of public domain books still to be converted into eBooks. If you want to help out, come join us and proofread a few pages. For more information, check out our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nFebruary 1, 2024: Year of the Dragon\n\nFor many people around the world who celebrate the Lunar New Year, February 10 marks the start of the Year of the Dragon. Here at Faded Page, we have a number of books that feature dragons in one way or another!\n\nDragons, real, imaginary or symbolic, appear in a number of mysteries. These include The Mystery of the Fire Dragon by Carolyn Keene from the popular Nancy Drew series and The Dragon Murder Case by S. S. Van Dine from the Philo Vance series.\n\nDragons can be fearsome creatures, as seen in Dragon Moon: A Novelette of Lost Atlantis, a story that appeared in pulp magazine Weird Tales. Another work in the fantasy genre is the classic novel, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C. S. Lewis from the Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nMore charming stories suitable for younger children include Freddy and the Dragon, the final book in the Freddy the Pig children’s series by Walter R. Brooks and Poo-Poo and the Dragons by C. S. Forester and illustrated by Robert Lawson.\n\nAccording to Chinese horoscopes, the coming Year of the Dragon is supposed to bring new opportunities and challenges to those prepared to take them on. With that in mind, consider joining our team of volunteers! For more information, check out our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\n. January 15, 2024: Knitting and Crocheting\n\nFaded Page is known mainly for its fiction, such as drama, mystery and classic literature, and its non-fiction, such as history, periodicals and travel. But buried within all these books are a few odds and ends that don’t get much attention. One such group is our knitting and crochet pattern books. Knitting and crocheting are craft hobbies using needles to create fabric from yarn, which is a long length of fibre such as wool that is often wound into balls. Knitting uses two needles to interlace loops of yarn to form fabric. Crochet is similar but uses a hook to interlock loops of yarn.\n\nWe have five books that describe how to knit and crochet. For example, Book 190: Learn to Knit is a basic instructional book on teaching the basics of knitting: what equipment you need, types of yarn to use, and how to use two needles to turn yarn into clothing. Once you learn the techniques, you can move on to Book 168: Bazaar Crochet and Knit. In this book you can create small knickknacks that you might see for sale at a craft show. For the more adventurous, you can tackle Book 156: Fashions For Men to Knit and Crochet. This book contains patterns on how to create sweaters, socks and scarves. While the authors of these patterns had boys and men in mind for the clothing, there is nothing to stop you from knitting these for girls and women. Knitting and crocheting may not be for everyone, but once you learn the basics, it provides a lifetime of enjoyment!\n\nIf you like what we do, come join us and proofread a few pages.

An isolated country house. All the ingredients are here for a classic English mystery set on Christmas Eve. Mystery in White: A Christmas Crime Story by Joseph Jefferson Farjeon was published in 1937. In this story, a group of passengers, strangers to one another, abandon the snowbound train and find shelter in a house. The house is apparently deserted but filled with inviting comforts. Then a body is found.\n\nJ. Jefferson Farjeon (1883-1955), born in London, England, was a Golden Age mystery novelist, playwright and screenwriter. One of his stage plays, Number Seventeen, was adapted to film by Alfred Hitchcock. In the past decades, there has been renewed interest in his work, as several of them have been republished by well-known publishers.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have an assortment of works by Farjeon, which can be found here, and we continue to work at broadening this collection. If you would like to help us add more public domain works to Faded Page, please consider volunteering at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nHappy holidays to all our readers and volunteers and best wishes for the new year!\n\nDecember 1, 2023: The Group of Seven\n\nThe Group of Seven were a famous group of Canadian artists who were known for their vivid depictions of Canadian landscapes, especially from the northern part of the country. The original group included Franklin Carmichael, Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley. As with many people who have careers in the arts, these men were not completely focused on landscapes. Many of them took on other contracts to make a living. These included book illustrations, some of which are featured here on Faded Page.\n\nArthur Lismer did sketches, one of which is shown here, for Come A Singing!, a book of Canadian folk songs by Marius Barbeau. Frank (Franz) Johnston illustrated Friendly Acres, a book of humorous anecdotes by Peter McArthur. Franklin Carmichael created some engraving work for the Thorn-Apple Tree by Grace Campbell. Frederick Varley illustrated Canada: The Foundations of Its Future, by Stephen Leacock.\n\nTwo other notable artists, Tom Thomson and Emily Carr, were not members but are frequently associated with the Group of Seven. Both of them are featured on Faded Page but that is another story.\n\nIf you would like to help us add more public domain books to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada\n\nNovember 15, 2023: Freddy Goes to Florida by Walter R. Brooks\n\nHere in Canada, a “snowbird” refers to a Canadian who travels to Florida before the snow arrives and returns with the onset of spring, after having spent the winter enjoying the sunny climate down south. Perhaps Canadian snowbirds have been inspired by Freddy the Pig, the main character of a popular children’s series by Walter R. Brooks.\n\nThe first book, Freddy Goes to Florida, was first published in 1927 with the title To and From Again and has Freddy joining a group of his barnyard friends in travelling to Florida from Upstate New York. They have hilarious adventures along the way, encountering alligators and other dangers, and eventually returning to the farm of their owners, the Beans..\n\nHere at Faded Page, most of the 26 Freddy books published between 1927 and 1958 can be found here: Special Collection: The Works of Walter R. Brooks. You can also learn more about Freddy at Friends of Freddy, an organization devoted to the appreciation of this book series.\n\nIf you would like to help us add more public domain books to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada\n\nNovember 1, 2023: The Novels of John Buchan\n\nWith the release of A Lodge in the Wilderness, Faded Page has a complete collection of the novels written by John Buchan. Buchan, a prolific author of Scottish birth, wrote 27 novels. His stories range from spy fiction to adventure. His best known work, The Thirty-Nine Steps, a book featuring one of Buchan’s favorite characters, Richard Hannay, is about a mysterious plot to assassinate the King of Greece in the hopes of starting World War I. Alfred Hitchcock adapted the book to film in a well known movie with a completely different plot but the essence of the book is still there. There are four other novels featuring Richard Hannay including Greenmantle and The Island of Sheep. There are also five books in the Sir Edward Leithen series and three books in the Dickson McCunn series. Notable standalone novels include The Free Fishers, “a tale of conspiracy, secret societies, foreign agents and a fiendish plot to assassinate the Prime Minister.” In addition to his novels, Buchan wrote books on military history and biographies.\n\nCome and browse through all 57 books that Faded Page offers on John Buchan.

Abigail’s awakened corpse attempts to summon forth Nyogtha, an amorphous mass composed of a black sticky substance capable of extending tentacles to manipulate the environment, in order to wreak her vengeance on the descendants of the townsfolk responsible for her death. The only way Nyogtha can be sent back to its dimension is through the use of a ritual combining an ankh, the Tikkoun elixir, and the Vach-Viraj incantation.\n\nNyogtha is one of several Cthulhu Mythos deities which Kuttner created as a member of the “Lovecraft Circle”. His first published story, “The Graveyard Rats”, caught H.P. Lovecraft’s eye and the two began corresponding. Lovecraft encouraged Kuttner to incorporate Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos elements into Kuttner’s own work which Kuttner did. Kuttner’s contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos include creating Iod, Vovadoss, and Hydra, and Nyogtha in “The Salem Horror” story.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have six Kuttner Cthulhu Mythos stories: “Hydra”, “The Frog”, “Spawn of Dagon”, “The Invaders”, “The Jest of Droom-Avesta”, and “The Salem Horror”, in addition to 120 other Kuttner titles.

This is the season where, in many parts of the world, people can enjoy the fruits of the farmers’ labours over the past months. In Canada, the Thanksgiving holiday is celebrated on the second Monday of October. Lucy Maud Montgomery has written a number of short stories about this special day, including “The Bartletts’ Thanksgiving Day”. Thanksgiving in the United States is celebrated later in the season. Laura Ingalls Wilder gives a mouth-watering description of a Thanksgiving feast in Little Town on the Prairie. For a look at an Asian celebration, you can read about China’s Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, in Poets and Murder from the Judge Dee historical mystery series.\n\nThere are also books celebrating the natural beauty of the season. Round the Year with Enid Blyton – Autumn Book is written for children and describes educational activities that teach them about the plants that abound in autumn and the behaviours of animals at this time of year. Frances Cornford’s Autumn Midnight is a collection of poems that evoke the moods of the season. Finally, Lucy Maud Montgomery’s essay, “The Woods in Autumn”, describes the glorious beauty and “uncanny enchantment of the autumn forest.”\n\nIf you would like to help us add more public domain works like these to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nImage: Autumn Woods by Albert Bierstadt (1830–1902).\n\nSeptember 15, 2023: The Story of a National Crime\n\n“September 30 marks the day for the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. The day honours the children who never returned home and survivors of residential schools, as well as their families and communities. Public commemoration of the tragic and painful history and ongoing impacts of residential schools is a vital component of the reconciliation process.”\n\nSo say the words of the Canadian Federal government on this shameful aspect of Canadian history. It is a mark of our time that the government has owned up to its participation in the residential schools that were part of Canada’s less than stellar engagement with its native peoples.\n\nUnfortunately the response was not so open in the past. In the early 20th century, Peter Henderson Bryce was a health inspector who visited residential schools and reported on the deplorable conditions under which the schools were run. This report is available here at Faded Page: The Story of a National Crime: being an appeal for justice to the Indians of Canada.\n\nBryce reported that extremely poor sanitary conditions were leading to a high rate of disease and death mainly due to tuberculosis, a very preventable disease. The author characterized this as a national crime and hoped that his report would lead to meaningful action. Unfortunately the government at the time refused to publish the report and quietly terminated Bryce’s employment. Bryce in turn published the report at his own expense but as we can see from history, it received little recognition.\n\nBryce’s report achieved little and he suffered the consequences. We can all hope for more transparency with our future government and less need for whistleblowers like Peter Henderson Bryce.\n\nIf you would like to help us add other public domain works like this one to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nSeptember 1, 2023: First Steps in Reading\n\nAs many students here in Canada and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere return to school, you may be interested in seeing how students learned to read in the early 20th century.\n\nFor example, The Canadian Readers, Book I, A Primer and First Reader offers a charmingly illustrated collection of Mother Goose and other verses.\n\nThe Haliburton First Reader by Margaret Winifred Haliburton collects simple poems and song lyrics and includes material taken from works by well-known writers such as Christina Rossetti, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Its follow-up, The Haliburton Second Reader, features poetry and short tales. We are working on adding more books from this series to our collection.\n\nMore advanced readers may have been assigned readings from Narrative and Lyric Poems, edited by O. J. Stevenson. This included classic poems from the likes of Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\nThese books give us a glimpse into the education of children in North America a century ago. If you would like to help us add other public domain books to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nAugust 15, 2023: Ringing the Changes, An Autobiography by Mazo de la Roche\n\nMazo de la Roche was born in Newmarket, Ontario, north of Toronto, on January 15, 1879 and died July 12, 1961 at the age of 82 in Toronto. Some of the information conveyed below is from her autobiography, Ringing the Changes, and from Wikipedia.\n\nAs an adult, de la Roche wrote various plays and short stories, and managed to sell some of them, like most writers starting off. Her first published book, Explorers of the Dawn, appeared in 1922, and was a fix-up of some previously published sketches, vignettes and stories rewritten. Her first two proper novels, Possession (soon to be in Faded Page) from 1923 and Delight from 1926, were romantic novels. They were mild successes but nevertheless earned her little in income or recognition.\n\nHer third novel, Jalna, was submitted to the American magazine Atlantic Monthly, winning a $10,000 award. Its subsequent publication in 1927 brought de la Roche fame and fortune at the age of 48. She ended up writing 16 Jalna novels covering a century in the life of a family called the Whiteoaks and their various generations in a fictional locale in Southern Ontario. Her final novel Morning at Jalna appeared in 1960 when she was 81.\n\nMazo de la Roche’s Jalna books, along with a Whiteoaks play, are available here, while all her books that are available at Faded Page can be found here.\n\nIf you enjoy these works and would like to help us add other public domain books to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nAugust 1, 2023: The Golden Amazon\n\nJohn Russell Fearn (1908-1960) was an extremely prolific British author who wrote under many pseudonyms including Vargo Statten and Volsted Gridban. During the 1930s, he wrote for pulp magazine but switched during World War II to books. Becoming a central figure in the post-war paperback boom, he wrote numerous westerns, crime stories, and romances as well as his science fiction.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Thorton Ayre, Fearn wrote a four-novelette series for Fantastic Adventures magazine featuring the Golden Amazon. Complementing the Superman figure created in the 1930’s, superwoman Violet Ray, known as the Golden Amazon, was the caped crusader. The first novelette, The Golden Amazon, ran in July 1939. It was followed by The Amazon Fights Again, The Golden Amazon Returns, and finally Children of the Golden Amazon. Fearn abandoned pulp and gave the character an entirely different origin story for the original novel The Golden Amazon in 1944, which, despite claims in several bibliographies, is not a mere reworking of the magazine stories. The 1944 novel was reprinted in The Toronto Star Weekly to such acclaim that twenty-three sequels followed, the last appearing posthumously there in 1961.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have the original four novelettes, in addition to 131 other titles by Fearn, with more titles in the works.

The North American Lake Management Society proclaimed July as the time to respect our lakes and not take water for granted. We work and play on them and drink from them. Let’s not forget that and try to take better care of them. On Faded Page we have a number of lake related books.\n\nWaterton Lakes National Park: lakes amid the mountains describes one of Canada’s treasured resources. Nestled in the mountains of British Columbia, this government publication describes not only the lakes but also the interesting geological formations. An older but no less interesting book, Historic handbook of the northern tour. Lakes George and Champlain; Niagara; Montreal; Quebec describes the intertwined histories of New France and New England in the 17th and 18th centuries. It also delves into the historical sites along the St. Lawrence Valley. In the fiction category we have Lake of Gold by John Buchan, which relates the tale of a young boy spending his summer holidays in the Canadian countryside. In the mystery category we have The Chinese Lake Murders by Robert Hans van Gulik, an intriguing story of political intrigue, sordid greed, and dark passions in ancient China.\n\nWe have several lake related books in our rounds which will soon become ebooks on Faded Page. Help us get those published sooner by volunteering to proof a few pages at our related site at Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nJuly 1, 2023: Happy Canada Day!\n\nThe Origin and Meaning of Place Names in Canada, compiled by George Henry Armstrong (1858-1938), gives insight into Canada’s early history and shows the influence of First Nations and settlers on the country’s development.\n\nMany places take the names of early settlers, honoured for their contributions to government, the military or business, Others pay homage to royalty from England and France, including the cities of Regina, Victoria, and Prince Albert, and the town of Louisbourg.\n\nIn Ontario, one can take a tour of cities inspired by their European eponyms. These include London, Paris, Athens, Swansea, Limerick, Dresden and Odessa.\n\nOccasionally, place names reflected local annoyances. For example, Souris, the French word for “mouse”, was used to name a river and two towns which had experienced plagues of mice. The Chaleur inlet in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was named for the oppressive heat experienced by Jacques Cartier and his sailors.\n\nA large number of names have their origins in the languages of Canada’s First Nations. For example, the Memphremagog lake in Quebec is derived from an Abenaki term meaning “great extent of water”. The town of Penetanguishene in Ontario is from an Abenaki name meaning “the place of white falling sands”. The name Quebec means “where the water narrows” in the Algonquin, Cree and Micmac languages. Finally, the name Canada is derived from the Iroquois word Kanata or Kanada, meaning “cabin” or “lodge”.\n\nSince 1930, the publication of this book, there have been many new place names added to the Canadian landscape, reflecting the increasing diversity of its population. Examples include Ikeda Bay, named after the Ikeda Mine in British Columbia, which employed many Japanese immigrants, and the community of Okno in Manitoba, settled by Ukrainian and Icelandic immigrants.\n\nHappy Canada Day to all our readers, volunteers and friends here at Faded Page!

Here are some suggestions for books that you can read while relaxing on vacation or just enjoying the warm sunny weather.\n\nAmong our juvenile fiction, you can find Summer Term at St. Clare’s, the third book in Enid Blyton’s series about twin sisters at a boarding school, or The Clue of the Black Flower by Carolyn Keene, which has the Dana girls solving a mystery while at summer camp.\n\nConsider reading L. M. Montgomery’s essay, \"The Woods in Summer\" before going on your next nature walk, and browse through Canadian Wildflowers or North American Wildflowers by Catharine Parr Traill and Agnes Fitzgibbon to identify flowers you might see along the way.\n\nIf your favourite summer activity is gardening, browse through our many issues of The Canadian Horticulturalist, found in our Periodicals Collection.\n\nIf exploring new places is what you like to do in the summer, try Topper Takes a Trip by Thorne Smith, a hilarious comedy with ghosts, or A Moveable Feast, Ernest Hemingway’s memoirs about his time in France.\n\nFinally, consider Summer by Edith Wharton. This is one of Wharton’s lesser-known works because the subject matter was controversial for the time, but the author had declared it one of her own personal favourites.\n\nIf you enjoy these works and would like to help us add other public domain books to our collection, please consider volunteering to proof a few pages at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.\n\nImage: “Reading by the Shore” by Charles Sprague Pearce (1851-1914)\n\nJune 1, 2023: Canada's Early Women Writers: Grace Campbell\n\nGrace Campbell (1895 – 1963) was born Grace MacLennan Grant in Williamstown, Ontario. Williamstown is in a rural part of eastern Ontario, near the St. Lawrence River. She grew up on a farm in the area. Both her parents were of Scottish ancestry and the surrounding community was rich with Highland heritage. It was this environment that inspired her first novel, Thorn-apple Tree. Before her writing career, she attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario and excelled at English literature. It was at university that she met her future husband, Reverend Harvey Campbell.\n\nGrace and Harvey had three sons, Alexander and Robert who were twins and a younger son named Donald. During World War II, both twins who served as pilots in the RCAF died in action in 1944.\n\nThe grieving of the loss of her sons did not affect her future writing as she continued to publish books about every three years. In addition to Thorn-apple Tree, we also have Fresh Wind Blowing available on Faded Page. Other novels such as The Higher Hill and Torbeg are in the process of becoming eBooks at our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nHelp us add more of Campbell’s works and other public domain books by volunteering to proof a few pages.\n\nMay 15, 2023: Jean Giraudoux\n\nJean-Hippolyte Giraudoux (1882-1944) était un diplomate, romancier, essayiste et dramaturge français. Il est considéré comme l’un des dramaturges les plus importants de l’entre-deux-guerres.\n\nLa présentation de sa première pièce, Siegfried, a propulsé Giraudoux des rangs des romanciers mineurs au premier plan du mouvement théâtral français. Ce succès fulgurant auprès du public et de la critique durera toute sa vie et même au-delà, puisque certaines de ses œuvres ultérieures ne seront jouées qu’après sa mort, notamment l’une de ses plus populaires, La Folle de Chaillot.\n\nLe thème majeur de Giraudoux, la recherche par l’homme d’une pureté et d’un idéal au-delà des imperfections de la réalité, a touché une corde sensible chez les spectateurs des années 1930. Ce thème apparaît sous une forme concrète dans La Guerre de Troie n’aura pas lieu, où les personnages débattent de la question de la paix et de la guerre. On pourrait dire que la véritable raison de l’attrait de Giraudoux est son style - son récit élégant, civilisé et plein d’esprit de la vie dans ses divers aspects. L’usage particulier que l’écrivain fait des métaphores et des symboles, sa vision ironique de la réalité et son sens de la spontanéité et de l’inattendu ont ravi son public.\n\nSi vous aimez ce que nous faisons et souhaitez voir plus de Jean Giraudoux sur Faded Page, rejoignez-nous et relisez quelques pages. Pour plus d’informations sur comment participer bénévolement, consultez notre site compagnon, Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nJean-Hippolyte Giraudoux (1882-1944) was a French diplomat, novelist, essayist, and playwright. He is considered one of the most important dramatists for the period between the two World Wars.\n\nThe presentation of his first play, Siegfried, catapulted Giraudoux from the ranks of the minor novelists to the forefront of the French theatre movement. This startling success with both audiences and critics was to last throughout his lifetime and beyond, as some of his later works were not performed until after his death, including one of his most popular, La Folle de Chaillot (The Madwoman of Chaillot).\n\nGiraudoux’s major theme, man’s search for a purity and an ideal beyond the imperfections of reality, touched a sensitive nerve with the theatre-going public of the 1930s. The theme appears in a concrete form in La Guerre de Troie n’aura pas lieu (Tiger at the Gates) in which the characters debate the issue of peace and war. It could be argued that the real reason for Giraudoux’s appeal was his style—his elegant, civilized, witty account of life in its diverse aspects. The writer’s special use of metaphors and symbols, his ironic view of reality, and his sense of the spontaneous and the unexpected delighted his public.\n\nIf you like what we do and want to see more Jean Giraudoux on Faded Page, come join us and proofread a few pages.

While this is troubling, the censorship of written material is nothing new. In Canada, book censorship has been going on for nearly 100 years. In 1938, an “examiner of publications” reviewed 1,400 publications and banned 56 titles that were considered seditious or salacious. Canada customs also has a long history of preventing the importation of materials that it considers “lewd”, including many titles with LGBTQ+ themes. Politicians on both sides of the debate have commented on censorship. One Member of Parliament expressed a wish that the border services would read the text instead of just looking at the pictures. Another accused them of not being able to tell the difference between literary realism and pornography.\n\nThere are a number of books on Faded Page that have been banned in the past. When Peyton Place was published in 1956, its importation was banned due to lewd and salacious language. The ban was lifted in 1958. The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall was banned in British Columbia, as well as Ulysses by James Joyce. Other books, such as Sanctuary by William Faulkner, also experienced the sour eye of our customs officials. Some authors experience wholesale bans on their works, and these include Guy de Maupassant, Leon Trotsky and D. H. Lawrence.\n\nThere are many other books, both mundane and controversial, that are waiting in the wings for publication on Faded Page. Help us get them there sooner by volunteering to proofread a few pages! For information, go to Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nApril 15, 2023: The Crime at Black Dudley by Margery Allingham\n\nThe Crime at Black Dudley is the first book in Margery Allingham’s Albert Campion series. In a remote country manor, members of a house party gather to play a ritualistic game, but soon after, the host’s uncle is found dead.\n\nAlbert Campion, an amateur detective, plays only a minor role in this first book but is the key character in 18 more books and many short stories that make up the series. Eight of the stories were adapted for television in 1989 and 1990, with Peter Davison assuming the role of Campion. Campion likes to come across as fatuous but is, in truth, clever and well-educated, with an aristocratic background.\n\nMargery Allingham (1904-1966) was a popular English novelist from the “Golden Age” of detective fiction. While best known for her Campion stories, Allingham was a prolific writer and had published many other novels, novellas and short stories, as well as several stage and radio plays.\n\nYou can find a selection of Allingham’s work here at Faded Page, including most of the Campion novels. If you would like to help us augment this collection, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Johns\n\nThe Worrals series consists of 11 books published between 1941 and 1950 by English writer Capt. William Earl Johns (1893-1968), author of the Biggles and Gimlet series. The first book in the series is Worrals of the W.A.A.F. All the other titles have “Worrals” in the title, and the series at Faded Page can be found here. The first six books take place during World War II, while the remaining five books are located after the war, in remote and exotic places around the world.\n\nWhen WWII broke out, Johns became a lecturer at the Air Defence Cadet Corp. Due to his success in encouraging young men to train to be pilots through his Biggles series of stories, the Air Ministry requested that he create a female counterpart to Biggles to aid in the recruitment effort for the W.A.A.F. (Women’s Auxiliary Air Force). The character “Worrals” first appears in 1941 with her side-kick “Frecks”, both flying for the W.A.A.F. By the time the fourth Worrals book, Worrals on the War-path, was released, Worrals and Frecks were actively behind the lines engaged in the war.\n\nJohns modeled Worrals after two female aviators he knew: Pauline Gower, who established the women’s branch of the Air Transport Auxiliary during WWII, and Amy Johnson (“Johnnie”), who was the first woman to fly solo from London to Australia. Interestingly, our next and eighth Faded Page Worrals book to be released is Worrals Down Under.\n\nIf you like what we do here at Faded Page and would like to help us add even more public domain books to the site, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Walsh produced some 20 novels and numerous short stories, many set in Scotland or the West of Ireland and containing a mix of drama and romance. Much of his work invoked a rural Ireland that was fast disappearing in the 1930s. His most popular short story, “A Quiet Man”, became an Oscar-winning movie with John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara.\n\nMuch of his work was produced in the aftermath of the 1923-1924 Irish Civil War. Like other Irish writers of his era, Walsh was influenced by Romantic nationalism. In his novels, he appeals to the idea of a united Gaeldom and a united Ireland, regardless of nationality or religion. And No Quarter (coming soon to Faded Page) is set within Montrose’s combined Scottish-Irish army, while the hero is an Englishman and member of the Protestant Church of Ireland. The five stories in Green Rushes that include “The Quiet Man” share a common theme of IRA members coming to terms with their memories of the fighting.\n\nThese titles are just a few of the Maurice Walsh titles we carry on Faded Page with more to come. If you like what we do, come join us and proofread a few pages. For more information about how to volunteer, visit our companion site, Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nMarch 1, 2023: International Women’s Day: Gaudy Night by Dorothy Sayers\n\nOn March 8, we celebrate International Women’s Day, and the 2023 theme is “Embrace Equity”. A worthwhile book to read, that helps us see the inequity in higher education faced by women in the past and to appreciate the gains we have made since, is Gaudy Night by Dorothy Sayers.\n\nThis 10th novel from Sayers’s Lord Peter Wimsey series of detective novels has Wimsey in a minor role while featuring Harriet Vane instead. Vane returns to Shrewsbury College, her alma mater, to help the Dean investigate mysterious and malicious incidents happening at the school.\n\nShrewsbury, a fictional college, is based on Somerville College, Sayers’s own alma mater and a part of University of Oxford. She studied modern languages and medieval literature there and graduated with first-class honours in 1915. At the time, degrees were not awarded to women, and it was not until 1920 that Sayers was finally awarded an MA degree.\n\nApart from giving us a glimpse of the challenges women faced in pursuing higher education at that time, Gaudy Night is also a first-rate mystery of the kind for which Sayers is known.\n\nYou can help us bring more public-domain works like this one to Faded Page. All it takes is proofreading a few pages. More information about volunteering can be found at our partner site, Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023: Black History Month\n\nFebruary is Black History Month in Canada. This country has a long and varied history with people of African heritage. The first ones came to Upper Canada as slaves, a little known but shameful fact. These people came with United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution and some of them owned slaves. Fortunately, freedom began early in 1793 when Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe banned the importation of slaves and freed some of their children living here. In 1819 all slaves were declared free. During the early part of the 19th century Upper Canada became known as a haven for refugees fleeing slavery. A large influx came after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1850. Before the American Civil War there were over 50,000 former slaves living in Upper Canada.\n\nHistorian Fred Landon, who worked at the University of Western Ontario, documented many of the slaves’ stories, some of which we host on Faded Page. Agriculture Among the Negro Refugees in Upper Canada describes the experience of former slaves who took up farming here. They proved to be just as competent at agriculture as comparable settlers from England and France. Canadian Negroes and the Rebellion of 1837 talks about the part some of them played in our own political strife. Canadian Negroes and the John Brown Raid discusses their participation in this incident in 1859, which was one of the events that led up to the American Civil War.\n\nThese are a few of the papers that are on Faded Page and more are on the way. You can help proof some of these and other books at our partner site, Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023: The Father Brown Stories by G.K. Chesterton\n\nFather Brown is a fictional Roman Catholic priest and amateur detective who, with shapeless clothes, a large umbrella, and an uncanny insight into human behavior, solves mysteries and crimes. His unremarkable, seemingly naïve appearance hides an unexpectedly sharp intelligence and keen powers of observation. His job as a priest allows him to blend into the background of a crime scene, using his unimposing demeanor to his advantage when studying criminals, to whom he seems to pose no danger.\n\nHe is featured in 53 short stories by English author G. K. Chesterton, published between 1910 and 1936. Chesterton loosely based him on the Rt. Rev. Msgr. John O’Connor (1870–1952), a parish priest in Bradford, who was involved in Chesterton’s conversion to Catholicism in 1922.\n\nWhen he created Father Brown, Chesterton was already famous in Britain and America for his philosophical and paradox-laden fiction and nonfiction. Father Brown was a vehicle for conveying Chesterton’s view of the world and, of all his characters, is perhaps closest to Chesterton’s own point of view, or at least the effect of his point of view. Father Brown solves his crimes through a strict reasoning process more concerned with spiritual and philosophical truths than with scientific details, making him an almost equal counterbalance with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, whose stories Chesterton read. However, The Father Brown series commenced before Chesterton’s own conversion to Roman Catholicism.\n\nChesterton wrote 25 Father Brown stories between 1910 and 1914, then another 18 from 1923 to 1927, then 10 more from 1930 to 1936. Most of these can be found in The Father Brown Stories.\n\nIf you like what we do and want to see more G. K. Chesterton on Faded Page, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Judge Dee is a famous magistrate-detective, justly described as “the Sherlock Holmes of ancient China”. This character is based on a real person who was born and worked during the seventh century in Liang (south-east) China. The first book, Dee Goong An (English title: Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee), was translated from Chinese and further books were written and illustrated by Robert Hans van Gulik as historical novels set in ancient China.\n\nJudge Dee has Liang Hoong (referred to as “Sergeant Hoong”) as his trusted adviser, and Ma Joong as first lieutenant to assist him. He was known as a magistrate (an official responsible for catching criminals as well as sentencing them) and dealt with mysteries usually involving one or more murders. As these events took place more than a thousand years ago, Judge Dee had to use his own powers of observation and ingenuity to solve the mysteries.\n\nNote that there are conflicting views about the numbering of the books in the series. To find the books, visit this page.\n\nPlease help us expand our collection of public domain ebooks by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

Faded Page, created in 2012, is also celebrating 10 years this year – quite an achievement on the Internet where Websites frequently come and go. DPC was co-founded by David Jones and Mike Shepard in 2007. To commemorate this event, an anniversary project was proposed where 25 books would be worked on throughout 2022, to be posted by December 1. And we did it! The last book in the mix, Egerton Ryerson: His Life and Letters, was posted to Faded Page on November 28. The 25 books are mostly Canadian. These include such titles as The Dark Weaver, by Laura Goodman Salverson, winner of the Governor-General’s Literary Award in 1937; The Bruce Beckons—The Story of Lake Huron’s Great Peninsula; The French Régime in Prince Edward Island; A Short History of the Canadian People; and Native Trees of Canada. There was one French book—Maria Chapdelaine, a classic of French-Canadian literature. This book was a dual entry, as both the original French version by Louis Hémon and a translated version by W. H. Blake were done. All these books are now available on Faded Page.\n\nThe anniversary project was the brainchild of David Jones who sadly passed away two months ago and did not live to see his dream come to fruition. However, his legacy lives on and more Canadian content will follow in the years to come.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books for Canadian authors like Hémon and Salverson by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

Snow skiing, ice hockey, ice skating and tobogganing are just a few of the many outdoor activities eagerly anticipated. But there are quieter delights about the coming of winter which many people also look forward to, such as a walk in the first snow.\n\nLucy Maud Montgomery captures the joy of a walk in the woods after the first snow in her short essay, “The Woods in Winter\", published in The Canadian Magazine’s Christmas edition of December 1911. Here she reacquaints herself with the trees, the wind, and the sunlight on the fresh new snow. This work provides an interesting comparison to her essays, “The Woods in Summer” and “The Woods in Autumn.”\n\nThese essays are just a few of the many Lucy Maud Montgomery titles we carry on Faded Page.

The term ‘pulp’ derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed.”\n\nWhile there were various types of “Pulp magazines”, we’re going to limit this article to specifically science fiction (sci-fi). Typically they cost about 10 cents to 25 cents, and contained multiple stories–-some short, some long with some being presented over multiple issues. Most were published in the United States by several publishers with varying magazine titles to help partially distinguish the type of stories they contained.\n\nSome authors may not have been well known at the start of their career, but the better ones came to be well known. Some of the more popular ones in FadedPage.com are: Ray Cummings, John Russell Fearn, Henry Kuttner, Otis Adelbert Kline, Cyril M. Kornbluth, Clark Ashton Smith and Stanley G. Weinbaum. If any of these names don’t sound familiar a number of authors wrote under a pseudonym, or more than one.\n\nAs you may expect some of the stories tried to base them on known astronomy and physics facts, while others were wild fictional adventure tales. You may notice some of the covers were geared toward young adolescent males, as some featured skimpily dressed females in situations that may not have anything to do with the stories. They would certainly not be used today and be considered grossly sexist, but back then they helped to sell the magazines.\n\nFeel free to check out some of these stories here.\n\nIf you would like to see more books like these, we invite you to come join us and proofread a few pages.

He came to Canada in 1911 and was so enamoured with Quebec that he wrote a novel, Maria Chapdelaine. The book is considered a classic of French Canadian literature. In the book, the widow Maria must contend with new suitors - one offers a change to life in the big city while another offers a continuation of life in the countryside.\n\nHémon died in a train accident in 1913 so was unable to see how popular his novel would become.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we are able to present to you both the French version and an English translation. Translated books are not as easy to publish since we must consider not only the author who must be in the public domain but also the translator. In this case, these are the original author, Louis Hémon, and the translator, W. H. Blake (1861-1925). In addition, we are also able to present a French version with illustrations by artist Gérard Cochet (1888-1969) who is also in the public domain.\n\nThe English language translation includes an introduction written by Blake. He critiques Hémon’s use of French Canadian idioms. Since Hémon was from France, he did not have a complete grasp of the idiosyncratic version of French that is spoken in Quebec.\n\nLouis Hémon est né en France. Il est venu au Canada en 1911 et s’est tellement épris du Québec qu’il a écrit un roman, Maria Chapdelaine. Ce livre est considéré comme un classique de la littérature canadienne-française. Dans le livre, la veuve Maria doit composer avec de nouveaux soupirants - l’un d’eux lui propose de changer de vie dans la grande ville ou devrait-elle choisir l’autre qui lui propose de continuer à vivre à la campagne.\n\nHémon est mort dans un accident de chemin de fer en 1913 et n’a pas pu constater à quel point son roman deviendrait populaire.\n\nIci, à Faded Page, nous sommes en mesure de vous présenter à la fois la version française et une traduction anglaise. Les livres traduits ne sont pas aussi faciles à publier car il faut tenir compte non seulement de l’auteur qui doit être dans le domaine public mais aussi du traducteur. Dans le cas présent, l’auteur original, Louis Hémon et le traducteur W. H. Blake (1861-1925). En outre, nous sommes également en mesure de présenter une version française illustrée puisque l’artiste Gérard Cochet (1888-1969) est également dans le domaine public.\n\nLa traduction en anglais comprend une introduction écrite par Blake. Il critique l’utilisation par Hémon des idiomes canadiens-français. Comme Hémon était originaire de France, il n’avait pas une compréhension totale de la version idiosyncrasique du français qui est parlé au Québec.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books for authors like Hémon by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

David was a co-founder of Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) which, with the aid of volunteers literally across the world, generates the eBooks we offer at FadedPage (FP) since 2012. David was always a passionate fan of books and wanted to support the digitization of Public Domain books for everyone to enjoy which was his impetus to create Distributed Proofreaders Canada back in 2007. It is one of the primary reasons he has been part of DPC’s hugely successful “save the books” campaign.\n\nDavid had his hands in all aspects of both sites and was a brilliant, caring leader, kind, and always there for a friend. In his personal life, he was involved with various concerns dealing with publishing and finance, and he was a loving husband and father. In England, where he was born, he first learned to love books and he later emigrated to Canada and also became fluent in French.\n\nWe will mention just one of the many eBooks David had put together. The Georgian Bay was one of David’s favourites, and he had visited many places around the bay. For those not familiar with it, Georgian Bay is the northeastern arm of Lake Huron (one of the five Great Lakes), wholly in Ontario, Canada. It is famous for its islands, boat cruises, parks, fishing and numerous communities surrounding it, as well as its wonderful sunsets! The accompanying image is a depiction of Georgian Bay by Group of Seven artist Frederick Varley.\n\nMany of us will very much feel David’s absence. Some of us interacted almost daily with him, while others knew him through his communications to all the members via our newsletter and forums. Your legacy, David, will live on to benefit readers of eBooks across the world! You will be missed.\n\nOctober 1, 2022: Femmes écrivaines canadiennes: Léonise Valois\n\nLéonise Valois était une journaliste et une poétesse canadienne-française. Elle est née dans une famille prospère de la banlieue de Vaudreuil-Dorion à l’ouest de Montréal. Bien que sa famille ne soit pas très aisée, c’est grâce à un riche cousin qu’elle et ses sœurs reçoivent une bonne éducation. Tôt dans sa vie, elle s’est intéressée à la poésie et a publié son premier texte en 1882. Son père tombe malade et meurt en 1898, ce qui l’oblige à trouver un emploi. Elle réussit à trouver un emploi de rédactrice de la page féminine d’un journal local. Ce n’était pas un emploi bien rémunéré mais il lui a permis d’écrire et elle a contribué à une rubrique, « Au coin du feu ». Elle continue à écrire des poèmes et, en 1910, elle publie un recueil de poèmes, Fleurs sauvages. Il s’agit du premier recueil entièrement consacré à la poésie d’une femme canadienne française. La poésie est d’inspiration romantique, à la fois lyrique et patriotique, et elle est bien accueillie à l’époque. Elle poursuit sa carrière en travaillant pour divers journaux et autres organismes, mais en 1931, elle subit un grave accident. Ses activités s’en trouvent réduites et elle meurt en 1936. Cependant, sa contribution la plus importante à l’histoire de la littérature et à l’histoire des femmes est qu’elle a été la première au Canada français à voir ses poèmes rassemblés dans un livre. Ainsi, malgré les obstacles familiaux et sociaux, et contre le modèle traditionnel qui limitait les femmes aux loisirs littéraires, elle a poursuivi son rêve et mérité, en tant que poète, le titre de femme de lettres qui lui était si cher.\n\nA short biography in English is available on the author page.\n\nWe invite you to come and join us here at Faded Page and proofread a few pages.

Born in Hamilton, Ontario he attended grade school in Manhattan, New York where his mother lived. Following grade school, he was self-educated and began initially writing poetry and plays and persuing his love of long-distance canoeing. After accepting a reporting job in 1906 on the Calgary Morning Albertan, he began a 3000-mile solo canoe journey exploring the northern part of the province, syndicating the story of his journey to Canadian newspapers.\n\nHe wrote many short stories and novels based on his early adventurous canoe voyages which were serialized in Cavalier, Western Story Magazine, Argosy, Munsey’s and Mystery magazines and then published later as novels such as Jack Chanty. His friend Christopher Morley, a writer of books and poetry, steered him past an overdose of northwestern stories into crime stories, adventure and romance. His most successful creation was the beautiful and brilliant Madame Rozika Storey and her plain assistant who explains the evolving solutions to her boss’ cases. These cases appeared in Argosy All-Story Weekly from 1922 through 1935 for a total of 30 stories. Footner is also known for his Amos Lee Mappin mystery series, with a New York mystery writer who is far less flamboyant than Madame Storey, and for a third Private Investigator series.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we feature the Madame Storey series and Amos Mappin Mystery series as well as many other titles of adventure, crime and romance such as Jack Chanty, A Self-Made Thief, The Obeah Murders, and Sinfully Rich.\n\nIf you want to see more mysteries and adventure e-books like these on Faded Page, come and join us and proofread a few pages.

It is widely considered one of the top 100 novels of all time. It may be one you studied in high school.\n\nOrwell thought that placing the time-frame 35 years in the future would work. Maybe he was off, and it should have been another 35 years later instead. There are a number of aspects that are dealt with in the novel. One is continuous surveillance by the authorities—the people are constantly reminded of this by the slogan, “Big Brother is watching you”. Now we have cameras almost everywhere watching almost everything. Another is an unending war involving Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. Now we have wars in one place or another, even if they’re not well publicized. How about the editing of history by the main character Winston Smith? Now we call it “Fake News”. How about Smith not being able to find razor blades and having his rations reduced? Now we call it supply-chain issues. Is the predicted past here now?\n\nIf you like this book and others by George Orwell that we have on our site, then consider helping us add more public domain books by proofreading a few pages!

Born into a prosperous St. John’s family, she was surrounded by art and literature in her youth. Known by her nickname ‘Peg’, she was intelligent and witty and her parents encouraged her studies by sending her to school in England. World War I interrupted her studies and the war affected her family deeply. One of her brothers was killed fighting with the Newfoundland Regiment and another brother was severely wounded. The trauma of these events influenced her later writing. The death of her father in 1920 and the depression led to financial hardship which inspired her to start writing to supplement the family’s income. Her first novel, The Eyes of the Gull tells the story of a young woman struggling to survive in a remote outport settlement and yearning to escape to a more cultured place. Her novels often featured strong women living in Newfoundland outports. During the Second World War, she volunteered at a hostel in St. John’s that catered to servicemen who were stationed in the city. Her last book, The Caribou Hut is a history of the establishment during the turmoil of the times. Duley was afflicted by Parkinson’s Disease in the 1950s and she lost the ability to write. Her slow decline ended in 1968 with her death.\n\nDuley was Newfoundland’s first novelist of repute and her four novels earned her (and Newfoundland) international recognition. In 1974 the Newfoundland Writer’s Guild established the Margaret Duley Writing Award in her honour and in 1976 she was designated a Person of National Historical Significance by the Government of Canada.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books for authors like Duley by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

He spent many years carrying out sky surveys documenting thousands of objects. In March 1781, he discovered a new object which, after weeks of verification and consultation with other astronomers, was determined to be a planet. The new planet was given the name Uranus; Uranus was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity. Herschel died in 1822 (age 83) after many more years of astronomical investigations.\n\nFaded Page currently has two biographies about Herschel along with another three on the subject of Astronomy.\n\nThe image above is a lithograph by A. Diethe showing William Herschel working with his sister, astronomer Caroline Herschel.\n\nIf you want to see more eBooks about astronomy and other sciences on Faded Page, come and join us and proofread a few pages.

Ostenso (pronounced like Austen + so) was born in Norway but her family emigrated to North America when she was a child. They eventually settled in Manitoba where she attended school. While studying at the University of Manitoba, she met her future husband and author Douglas Durkin (Durkin’s books are in the process of becoming Faded Page ebooks). Durkin, who was married, became estranged from his wife and children and chose to form a close personal relationship with his former student. Together they moved to New York where he began teaching at Columbia University.\n\nDuring her relationship with Durkin, Ostenso began writing novels. Her first work, Wild Geese, published in 1925, won a prize for best first novel from Curtis Brown worth $13,500. It also won the Dodd Mead First Novel Award. The story is about life on a farm in Manitoba. The image of a lone wild goose in flight is a metaphor for the feeling of loneliness that some of the characters feel in their remote rural isolation. A film version of the book was made in 1927.\n\nShe continued to write novels and short stories, a mixture of fiction and romance. Several of the books were written in collaboration with Durkin but only her name is in the book credits. At Faded Page, we host 21 of her books and more are on the way.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books for Ostenso, Durkin and other authors by volunteering to proofread a few pages! For information, go to Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nJuly 1, 2022: The Chronicles of Canada\n\nHappy Canada Day from all of us at Faded Page and Distributed Proofreaders Canada!\n\nOur final volume of The Chronicles of Canada has now been posted to Faded Page, just over 14 years since we began the 32-volume series, our first ÜberProject. The series was edited by George McKinnon Wrong and H. H. Langton with each volume written by various authors. Some of the authors are well-known Canadians such as Stephen Leacock, Sir Joseph Pope, Agnes C. Laut, and the final author to enter the public domain, W. Stewart Wallace.\n\nThe series, first published in 1914/1915, approaches Canada’s early history in a narrative and romantic fashion covering the major events and figures of Canadian history from the earliest beginnings up until Post-Confederation Canada (the early 1910’s). Written for popular reading, it sets forth in historic continuity the principal events and movements in Canada: from the original aborigines to the Norse Voyages, then to European exploration and settlements, to the Railway Builders and finally to the early years of Confederation and the Dominion. The volumes also include many illustrations and maps.\n\nThe Chronicles of Canada is one of our Special Collections.

Bambi’s life begins happily; there are forest animals to play with: the young friendly hare, the chattery squirrel, the noisy screech owl, and Bambi’s twin cousins, frail Gobo and beautiful Faline. But winter comes, and Bambi learns that the woods hold danger and things he doesn’t understand. The first snowfall makes food hard to find for all the animals.\n\nThen there is Man. He comes to the forest with weapons that can wound, or kill, an animal. Bambi learns sorrow at a young age when he loses his various animal friends and his mother to death. But eventually he grows up into a handsome stag.\n\nExcerpts gleaned from the Wikipedia article about this book:\n\nFelix Salten, himself an avid hunter, penned Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde after World War I, targeting an adult audience.\n\nIn his Foreword of the English translation by Whittaker Chambers, John Galsworthy called it a “delicious book—delicious not only for children but for those who are no longer so fortunate” and a “little masterpiece” that shows a “delicacy of perception and essential truth”. He observed that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn over the course of three hours in “silent absorption.”\n\nOver 200 editions of the novel have been published, with almost 100 German and English editions alone, and numerous translations and reprintings in over 30 languages. It has also been published in a variety of formats, including printed medium, audiobook, Braille, and e-book formats.\n\nThere have been numerous adaptations of the story in books for children, live theatre and ballet as well as animated and live-action films, all in various languages. The Disney animated film adapted the story considerably (including the addition of a rabbit “Thumper” and a skunk “Flower”) to make it less “grim and somber” for children.\n\nFirst published in 1923, it has been argued by liberal critics that Bambi was one of the first environmental novels.\n\nIf you want to see more books like these added to Faded Page, come join us and proofread a few pages. We reserve “easy to proof” projects, such as the English version of Bambi, for our beginner proofers and offer the help and guidance of experienced mentors.

Pride Month celebrates the LGBTQ+ community and recognizes the contributions of those individuals. Faded Page also recognizes the contributions of the LGBTQ community and so has a genre tag for LGBTQ eBooks. While the tag currently includes 8 titles related to LGBTQ themes, elements or issues, there will be more in the future.\n\nFaded Page has eBooks by over 25 recognized LGBTQ authors including Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West. eBooks by all the authors cover a very wide range of topics, both fiction and non-fiction. As well there are another 20 titles, by various LGBTQ authors—including Maurice by E.M. Forster—in process at our companion site: Distributed Proofreaders Canada.\n\nIf you want to see more eBooks by LGBTQ authors on Faded Page, come join us and proofread a few pages.

This is the first of two novels featuring the Continental Op, a detective with the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco (modelled on the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, where Hammett had worked about a decade before). The Continental Op, whose name is never revealed, has been sent to Personville to meet with Donald Willsson, the publisher of the main newspaper in town. However, this town is riddled with corruption, and Willsson is murdered while on his way to meet with the Op. The Op soon discovers, in his quest to solve the murder, that Personville’s nickname of Poisonville is well earned, and that digging up rocks to expose the creatures lurking below brings more death and destruction. You can read both Red Harvest and its sequel, The Dain Curse, here on Faded Page.\n\nHammett’s reputation as one of the founders of the hard-boiled genre of detective fiction is well earned.

She was born in Toronto, Ontario to a prosperous middle class family. Her maternal grandfather was John Price-Brown who wrote several historical novels (we have them here at Faded Page!). Her education featured the prestigious private school of Havergal College in Toronto and the Pensionnat des Allières in Switzerland.\n\nGraham started writing as a teenager but she was dissatisfied with her work and destroyed several manuscripts. She published her first novel in 1938. Swiss Sonata is based on her experience at the Swiss school. The book is about the young women students and teachers on the eve of World War II. The book won the Governor General’s fiction award in 1938. She followed with a better novel, Earth and High Heaven, about a wealthy Protestant woman from Montreal who wants to marry a Jewish lawyer from Ontario. The issue of anti-Semitism was rife in Canada at the time. Again she based it on her own experience when she wanted to marry a Jewish-Canadian lawyer. She won the Governor General’s award in 1944 for the book. She also produced a non-fiction work, Dear Enemies: A Dialogue on French and English Canada (it was co-written with Solange Chaput-Roland who is not in the public domain).\n\nGraham worked as a journalist and she was a frequent contributor to magazines. She died of a brain tumour at the age of 52.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books like these by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

There were 143 episodes, filmed in black and white, produced in the period 1961-1966.\n\nWilbur Pope was a small quiet man in the advertising business. He bought a horse named Ed. It was just a horse. But Mr. Pope enjoyed jogging him around on Sunday mornings and talking to him, and Ed seemed to understand. One time, while out on a ride, Mr. Pope started to sing. Ed looked around at him a couple times but Mr. Pope just smiled and patted his neck and said “You’re a good scout Ed,” and he went on singing. Then Ed turned around again and said “O for Pete’s sake Wilb shut up!” Once Wilbur regained his senses, they had a long talk and the main thing Ed told him was that animals can talk, only they almost never let humans know it because they’d just get a lot of extra work shoved on them.\n\nThe various stories typically involve Wilbur or Ed getting into mischief or trouble of some sort. While Ed didn’t directly talk to others, some heard him through hedges, or thought it was Wilbur. Things end up working out, sometimes for the better, and the two go off for a beer, which they both enjoy greatly!\n\nThe stories may cause you to wince or groan, but along the way there is a humorous side, and things generally work out for Wilbur and Mr. Ed. Also, Mr. Ed’s ability to talk was never explained!\n\nWe have 16 of the 23 books and they can be found here.

Over time, poetry forms evolved into ballads to tell history, odes to glorify events and persons or tell stories of victories of war, and other forms such as haiku and the modern poetry forms of today.\n\nHere at Faded Page, we have over 400 titles of poetry including The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels by Alexander Heidel and works of some well-known poets such as T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, and Stephen Vincent Benét. Canadian poetry is represented by E. J. Pratt’s narrative poem Towards the Last Spike, Lt.-Col. John McCrae’s In Flanders Fields And Other Poems, Mary Electa Adams’ From Distant Shores, and Canadian-born Arthur Stringer’s New York Nocturnes. Other eBooks can be found by browsing under the subject tag poetry.\n\nIf you like what we do here on Faded Page and want to help us add even more public domain books to the site, come join us and proofread a few pages.

The date and time are chosen to match the first digits, 3.14159, of the numerical approximation of the mathematical constant pi.\n\nThe first recorded algorithm for computing an approximation to pi was provided by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, and it is a geometric approach involving circles and polygons. To celebrate Archimedes’s achievement, consider reading “Science from Syracuse”, a short story by John Russell Fearn, first published in 1941 in the American pulp magazine Science Fiction. In this story, Archimedes travels in a time machine from Ancient Greece to 1960 New York City. His arrival affects the world in an unexpected and significant way.\n\nJohn Russell Fearn (1908-1960) wrote a great many stories under his own name as well as several different pseudonyms, including Polton Cross which he used for “Science from Syracuse”. You can find a number of his stories here on Faded Page.\n\nHelp us add more public domain works like these by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

Many of our readers are familiar with writers such as Lucy Maud Montgomery and Mazo de la Roche. However, we would like to introduce you to others that are lesser known but worthy of attention.\n\nMary Esther Miller MacGregor (“Essie” to her friends and family) was a Canadian author of novels and biographies, many of which reflected her interest in the history of Canada. Born Mary Esther Miller in a farming community near Orillia, Ontario, she started her career as a teacher. She began contributing a column to a magazine called Teacher’s Monthly but she quit soon after as she wanted to pursue her passion of writing stories. Her first book was ready to publish in 1905 but she found out that her name, Esther Miller, was already in use by an American author so she chose the pen-name, Marian Keith.\n\nShe married Reverend Donald MacGregor of the United Church in 1909 and soon became friends with Lucy Maud Montgomery who was also married to a minister. Her husband moved regularly due to his job so she ended up spending time in several Ontario communities including Toronto, Orillia, London and Owen Sound. Her experience during this time provided source material for her stories. In The Silver Maple, published in 1906 and set on the shores of Lake Simcoe, she portrayed social issues at the time, rivalries between clans of English, Scotch and Irish immigrants. She showed the breakdown of these tensions with the children who played with each other at school, who did not recognize these differences.\n\nAs a Watered Garden features a single woman who inherits a farm on Georgian Bay. MacGregor wrote 17 novels during her life and Faded Page currently hosts nine of her books.\n\nShe also co-wrote a book with Montgomery and Mabel Burns McKinley called Courageous Women, which according to the dust jacket has “inspiring biographies of girls who grew to be women of courage and achievement.” Unfortunately this book is unavailable as McKinley’s work is not in the public domain.\n\nMacgregor’s books were popular at the time and she achieved fame for her ability to convert complex themes into simple storylines. She has been grouped with Montgomery and Nellie McClung as contributors to the revival of Canadian writing by women.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books like these by volunteering to proofread a few pages!

The first book is Just William, and all the others have titles containing the word “William”, so here at Faded Page we refer to the entire series as Just William. We have only a few eBooks from this series posted so far (and they can be found here) but more are on their way!\n\nThe books chronicle the adventures of the unruly 11 year-old English schoolboy William Brown as a series of short stories in each book. They’ve been so popular that a 1948 movie and a few TV shows were made, and a fan website, The Just William Society, has been created.\n\nMost stories start with William getting some idea that starts him on some usually mischievous but typically well-meaning adventure. A number of them involve three of his friends, who as a group call themselves the Outlaws. The children’s dialog uses a form of slang, which some people may find irritating. While William usually has good intentions, the stories develop so that he runs into problems caused by himself, though he may not see them as such.\n\nThe stories may cause you to wince or groan, but along the way, there is a humourous side, and things generally work out for William.\n\nIf you like what we do here at Faded Page and would like to help us add even more public domain books to the site, come join us and proofread a few pages.

Through folk traditions, the day has become a cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance, love, and courtship throughout the world.\n\nIn the spirit of Valentine’s Day, we feature two books on courtship and courtly love.\n\nWritten by French writer Armand Silvestre, Le Petit Art d’Aimer is a guide to the intricate world of 19th century seduction and love. Delightfully illustrated by Lucien Métivet, it is filled with good humor, astute observation, and thoughtful advice.\n\nIn C. S. Lewis’s The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition, we have a discussion of the theory of courtly love and how the idea of love changed from the days of the French troubadours to the days of Elizabethan England with texts ranging from Chaucer to Spenser’s The Faerie Queene.\n\nWe here at Faded Page and Distributed Proofreaders Canada thank you for your support of our work!

Grâce aux traditions populaires, cette journée est devenue une célébration culturelle, religieuse et commerciale du romantisme, de l’amour et de la séduction dans le monde entier.\n\nDans l’esprit de la Saint-Valentin, nous vous présentons deux livres sur la séduction et l’amour courtois.\n\nÉcrit par l’écrivain français Armand Silvestre, Le Petit Art d’Aimer est un guide du monde complexe de la séduction et de l’amour au XIXe siècle. Délicieusement illustré par Lucien Métivet, il est rempli de bonne humeur, d’observations astucieuses et de conseils judicieux.\n\nDans The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition, C. S. Lewis traite de la théorie de l’amour courtois et de la façon dont l’idée de l’amour a évolué de l’époque des troubadours français à celle de l’Angleterre élisabéthaine, avec des textes allant de Chaucer à The Faerie Queene de Spenser.\n\nNous, à Faded Page et Distributed Proofreaders Canada, vous remercions de votre soutien pour notre travail!

His family emigrated to Upper Canada when he was a child. He studied at the University of Toronto to become a medical doctor. He was well known in Toronto as a nose and throat specialist which led to the publication of his first book in 1900, Diseases of the Nose and Throat.\n\nHe began to write novels after this using a pen-name, Eric Bohn. In his later life, progressive blindness forced him to retire from medicine and also inhibited his writing. He still managed to write five historical novels, four of which are available on Faded Page.\n\nIn particular is his tale about the Upper Canada Rebellion (depicted in the image above) in 1837, entitled, The Mac’s of ’37. It achieved considerable popularity at the time of publication and is rated in present-day histories of Canadian literature as one of the best books of Canadian vintage dealing with a purely Canadian topic.\n\nHis final book, Laura, the Undaunted tells the story of Laura Secord. The book details her life culminating in her famous participation in the War of 1812.\n\nHelp us add more public domain books like these by volunteering to proofread a few pages!
