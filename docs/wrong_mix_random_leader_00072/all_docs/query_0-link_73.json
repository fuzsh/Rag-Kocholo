        "text": "The Code of the Woosters\n\nby\n\nP. G. Wodehouse\n\nLiterary and Cultural References\n\nChapter 1 (pp. 5–20)\n\nAutumn — season of mists and mellow fruitfulness (p. 5)\n\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness,\n\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\n\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\n\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\n\nJohn Keats: Ode, “To Autumn” (1819)\n\none of those bracers of yours (p. 5)\n\nWe learn of Jeeves’s “pick-me-ups,” “morning revivers,” or “bracers” in several stories; the first mention (in story chronology) is in “Jeeves Takes Charge” (1916):\n\nIt is a little preparation of my own invention. It is the dark meat-sauce that gives it its color. The raw egg makes it nutritious. The red pepper gives it its bite. Gentlemen have told me they have found it extremely invigorating after a late evening.\n\nIn other stories the recipe provides aid and succour to other gentlemen as well. [NM]\n\nhe shimmered out (p. 5)\n\nJeeves’s movements in and out are usually described as noiseless and somewhat mystical. Here the allusion seems to be to a mirage, now seen, now unseen. [NM]\n\nDrones (p. 5)\n\nThe Drones Club in Dover Street is a magnet for Wodehouse’s idle young men about London, named after the male bees who do no work. It is first mentioned in Jill the Reckless/The Little Warrior (1920) and continues through Aunts Aren’t Gentlemen/The Cat-nappers (1974). Norman Murphy (In Search of Blandings) identified aspects of the Bachelors’ Club, the Bath Club, and Buck’s Club contributing elements to its creation. [NM]\n\nGussie Fink-Nottle … Madeline (p. 5)\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves (1934) for the backstory of their relationship. The events of that novel take place during the “preceding summer” a “few months” before this novel in story time. [NM]\n\nSir Watkyn Bassett, CBE (p. 5)\n\nSir Watkyn Bassett’s CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) does not entitle him to be called “Sir,” as it is one rank below a knighthood (which would be denoted by KBE — Knight Commander). And if, along with the “pot of money,” he had inherited a baronetcy, one would have expected him then to be described as “Sir Watkyn Bassett, Bart., CBE.” Also, other baronets in the canon, such as Sir Gregory Parsloe, are usually described as such, but nowhere is there any mention that Sir Watkyn is a baronet.\n\nWe must assume, therefore, that he is a Knight Bachelor, an honour that entitles the holder to be called “Sir” but, because it does not belong to one of the established Orders of Chivalry, is not normally marked by any post-nominal letters. Knights Bachelor are by no means unusual: well-known modern examples are England’s former rugby coach, Sir Clive Woodward CBE, and actor Sir Anthony Hopkins CBE.\n\nJael the wife of Heber (p. 5)\n\nHowbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.\n\nAnd Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.\n\n. . . .\n\nThen Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.\n\nAnd, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.\n\nBible: Judges 4:17–18, 21–22\n\nWodehouse was particularly fond of this story, which gets a mention in many of the books and stories, including “The Salvation of George Mackintosh” in The Clicking of Cuthbert, Ring for Jeeves ch. 18 (and the earlier play, Come On, Jeeves, Act III); Much Obliged, Jeeves ch. 8; Cocktail Time ch. 2; and Uncle Dynamite ch. 11.\n\ntissue restorer … reviver (p. 5) *\n\nA hint that Jeeves’s mixture contains a little of “the hair of the dog” (i.e. some alcohol). Bertie frequently calls cocktails “tissue restorers”; see Sam the Sudden. [NM]\n\nnosegay (p. 6)\n\nTypically a term used for a bouquet of flowers to be held in the hands, rather than a collection of travel brochures. [NM]\n\ngruntled (p. 6)\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary cites this, Wodehouse’s back-formation from “disgruntled,” as the first usage of the word. [NM]\n\nsands are running out (p. 7)\n\nFrom the old-fashioned hourglass, a metaphor for the time becoming shorter until a future event. [NM]\n\nBoat Race night (p. 7)\n\nThe events described here are recorded in “Without the Option” (collected in Carry On, Jeeves!) in which the Bosher Street magistrate is unnamed; he remarks that “I am aware that on the night following the annual aquatic contest between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge a certain licence is traditionally granted by the authorities.” Beginning in 1829 and annually since 1856 except during the two world wars, a rowing race between the eight-man boats of Oxford and Cambridge has been held on the river Thames from Putney to Mortlake, about 4.2 miles. The 2017 race was held on Sunday, April 2. This is one of the most popular sporting events in Britain, with over 250,000 spectators lining the banks of the river to watch. No doubt some spectators still get in trouble for excesses of celebration (or the reverse) on the night of the event.\n\nBertie seems to have had at least two such encounters with the police; he recalls being hauled up before the Vine Street magistrate during his second year at Oxford in Thank You, Jeeves (along with Chuffy Chuffnell) and Right Ho, Jeeves. He also recalls, in “Jeeves and the Chump Cyril,” having to bail out a pal who got pinched every Boat Race night. Other Wodehouse characters who celebrate to excess on Boat Race night include Oliver “Sippy” Sipperley in “Without the Option,” Lord Datchet in Piccadilly Jim, and Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps (recalled in “The Word in Season” and Joy in the Morning). Tipton Plimsoll pledges not to go on a real toot except on special occasions like Boat Race Night in Full Moon, ch. 10.5. [NM]\n\nMorten Arnesen points us to a web article with historical news reports since 1875 of Boat Race Night revelry and references to Wodehouse’s use of it in his fiction.\n\nBosher Street (p. 7) *\n\nA (fictitious) police court; see Summer Lightning.\n\nfive of the best (p. 7) *\n\nFive pounds; roughly equivalent to £340 or US$450 in modern terms. See below.\n\na pot of money (p. 7) *\n\nSee Ukridge.\n\nnot forgotten that man of wrath (p. 7)\n\nIn Homer’s Odyssey, the name Odysseus means “man of wrath.” See Love Among the Chickens for further literary parallels.\n\ntoddling (p. 7) *\n\nSee The Inimitable Jeeves.\n\ntwo shakes of a duck’s tail (p. 8)\n\nIdiom: very quickly. Wodehouse is using a variant of the more common “two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” a phrase that is thought to have originated in the US in the early 19th century.\n\nimpending doom (p. 8) *\n\nThese two words have long been coupled in literature; Wodehouse uses the phrase as early as 1912 (The Prince and Betty, US edition) and titled a 1926 short story “Jeeves and the Impending Doom.” Monty Bodkin is “becoming conscious of an impending doom” in Heavy Weather, ch. 7 (1933). Lord Shortlands flees to London to “postpone the impending doom” in Spring Fever, ch. 20 (1948). Bertie Wooster uses it for the threat of being married to Florence Craye in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 13 (1954), and for Sir Watkyn Bassett’s refusal to give Stinker Pinker a vicarage in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, ch. 19 (1963).\n\nAnatole, her French cook (p. 8) *\n\nSee “Clustering Round Young Bingo” (1925) for the story of how Anatole came to cook for the Travers household.\n\nbrowsing (p. 8) *\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves.\n\nsconces and foliation … scrolls, ribbon wreaths in high relief and gadroon borders (p. 8)\n\nExamples of silversmiths’ decorative patterns; sconces in this context are the tubular sockets of a candelabrum in which candles are inserted. Foliation is a leaf pattern; scrolls and ribbon wreaths are self-explanatory; high relief means deeply carved and/or highly molded to stand out from the surrounding surface. Gadroon borders are fancy edges of silver or gold items decorated with many small adjacent convex curves to give a beaded or rippled effect, as in the George II sauce boat at right. [NM]\n\nup to her Marcel-wave (p. 8) °\n\nThe Marcel-wave was introduced in 1872 by a Parisian hairdresser, Marcel Grateau, who had the idea of using a heated curling iron to produce natural-looking waves. Grateau’s idea revolutionised the art of women’s hairdressing and started a fashion that remained popular for nearly fifty years.\n\nThe US magazine serial and US first edition have “marcelle wave” here.\n\n[Not merely women’s hair; men with marcelled hair include Percy Pilbeam (Summer Lightning/Heavy Weather/Frozen Assets), Claude Winnington-Bates (Sam the Sudden), Stanhope Twine (Something Fishy), and some of the young men dancing at the Mustard Spoon night club in Money for Nothing. —NM]\n\n“What the Well-Dressed Man Is Wearing” (p. 8)\n\nThe story of Bertie’s sole literary effort is told in “Clustering Round Young Bingo” in Carry On, Jeeves! [NM]\n\nview-halloos . . . the Quorn, the Pytchley (p. 9)\n\n“View-halloo” is the huntsman’s cry when a fox breaks cover.\n\nThe Quorn and the Pytchley are two well-known hunts in central England, the Quorn primarily in Leicestershire, with some coverts in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, and the Pytchley straddling the Leicestershire–Northamptonshire border.\n\nan antique shop in the Brompton Road — it’s just past the Oratory (p. 9)\n\nThe London Oratory, built in 1893, was the first new Roman Catholic church to be built in London since the 16th-century Reformation. It is situated on Brompton Road, South Kensington, almost adjacent to the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\ntalking through the back of her neck (p. 9) *\n\nSlang for talking nonsense. Green’s Dictionary of Slang online gives citations [you may need to click the horizontal-lines icon to the right of 2003 on the timeline to show quotations] for various forms of this phrase, including a 1912 one attributing “talk from the back of his head” to a Maori proverb. The precise form is cited from “Sapper” (H. C. McNeile, author of the Bulldog Drummond series) in 1924 and from Wodehouse in 1934 (Right Ho, Jeeves).\n\nWodehouse uses it several times, half-a-dozen in Bertie’s voice and half-a-dozen or so elsewhere. The latest so far found:\n\nHe seemed to me to be talking through the back of his neck, the last thing you desire in a personal attendant.\n\nStiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, ch. 24 (1963)\n\nThe scales fell from my eyes (p. 9)\n\nAnd immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.\n\nBible: Acts 9:18. See Biblia Wodehousiana.\n\nregister scorn (p. 9) *\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves.\n\nnolle prosequi (p. 10)\n\nLatin: will not prosecute. In English law (and, with substantially the same meaning, in US law), nolle prosequi is a technical term which signifies a formal undertaking by the plaintiff in a civil action, or by the attorney-general in a criminal action, that he intends to proceed no further with the action.\n\nBertie is very fond of nolle prosequi, which he invariably interprets as representing that he is unable to do something.\n\noscillate the bean (p. 10) *\n\nshake the head; bean is US baseball slang for the head, as in bean ball. The OED cites Wodehouse from 1924’s Bill the Conqueror:\n\nHave I got to clump you one on the side of the bean?\n\nmy little chickadee (p. 10)\n\nIn North America, “chickadee” refers to any of about half-a-dozen species of songbirds of the genus Parus, members of which, elsewhere in the world, are commonly known as tits or titmice.\n\nAunt Dahlia seems to be using the term affectionately; in colloquial English, “chick,” “chick-a-biddy,” and “chick-a-diddle” are all used as affectionate forms of address to a child, and it is possible that “chickadee” is a corruption of the last of these.\n\n[The American comedian W. C. Fields (William Claude Dukenfield, 1880–1946) first spoke this endearment in the 1932 film If I Had a Million and freely inserted it in his scripts thereafter; his 1940 film pairing with Mae West was even titled My Little Chickadee. —NM]\n\nas cool as some cucumbers, as Anatole would say (p. 11) *\n\nThis is one of the phrases that Wodehouse borrowed from Barry Pain’s The Confessions of Alphonse (1917; reprinted in Humorous Stories, 1930). The narrator of the stories in that book is a French waiter whose English is easily recognizable as the source of Anatole’s mangled expressions. “And he get up and reach for his hat as cool as some cucumbers” comes from Alphonse, for instance.\n\n“There he was, advancing on you with glittering eyes and foam-flecked lips, and you drew yourself up as cool as some cucumbers, as Anatole would say, and said ‘One minute, Spode, just one minute. It may interest you to learn that I know all about Eulalie.’ ”\n\nJeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 15 (1954)\n\nShe remained what Anatole would have called as cool as some cucumbers.\n\nMuch Obliged, Jeeves, ch. 6 (1971)\n\ntight as an owl (p. 11) *\n\nSee Sam the Sudden.\n\nthe summer afternoon … when Gussie, … full to the back teeth with the right stuff, had addressed … Market Snodsbury Grammar School (p. 11)\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 17. [NM]\n\npublicans (p. 11)\n\nBertie’s use of “publicans” for “members of my public” seems to be his own invention; more usual senses of the word are the tax-collectors who worked for Rome in New Testament times, tax-collectors generally, heathens or unbelievers, and those who owned or ran public taverns. [NM]\n\nbimbos (p. 11)\n\nBertie uses the older sense of the word, originally from the US in the 1910s, of a chap or fellow, referred to informally or sometimes contemptuously. Later in the 1920s the term began to be applied in a derogatory way to women, especially ones more noteworthy for looks than for brains or virtue, and that sense is better known today. [NM]\n\nshell-like ears (p. 11–12) *\n\nVictorian cliché for delicately-formed feminine ears:\n\nThis, with more tender logic of the kind,\n\nHe poured into her small and shell-like ear\n\nThomas Hood: “Bianca’s Dream”\n\nSentences so fiercely flaming\n\nIn your tiny shell-like ear,\n\nI should always be exclaiming\n\nIf I loved you, Phœbe, dear.\n\nW. S. Gilbert: “To Phœbe” from the Bab Ballads.\n\ndon the spongebag trousers (p. 12)\n\nAccording to the OED, sponge-bag trousers are “men’s checked trousers, patterned in the style of many sponge-bags”; the first cited usage is in novelist Virginia Woolf’s Voyage Out, in 1915. [These are worn only as part of the “morning suit”; see the Gentlemen at Ascot illustration in this brief introduction with some period illustrations online. —NM]\n\nthe fatheaded girl thought I was pleading mine (p. 13) *\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves, ch. 10 (1934).\n\nshe handed Gussie the temporary mitten (p. 13)\n\nColloquial: jilted him temporarily. In addition to breaking an engagement, the phrase can also refer to someone being dismissed from his job:\n\nIt transpiring, moreover, that he had looted a lot of other things here and there about the place, I was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten…\n\n“Jeeves Takes Charge” [collected in Carry On, Jeeves (1925)]\n\nThe origin is unknown, but it perhaps derives from the Latin mittere, to send.\n\nAlso used in The Inimitable Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves!, Money in the Bank, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, Summer Lightning, Thank You, Jeeves, and probably many others.\n\nstraightened out at the eleventh hour (p. 13) °\n\nSee Love Among the Chickens and Biblia Wodehousiana.\n\nthe two pills (p. 13) *\n\nSee Hot Water.\n\nwithin an ace of (p. 13) *\n\nSee Leave It to Psmith.\n\nthe sort of hornswoggling highbinder (p. 14)\n\nAmerican slang. To hornswoggle is to cheat, to pull the wool over someone’s eyes.\n\nWould she have the generosity to realize that a man ought not to be held accountable for what he says in the moment when he discovers that he has been cheated, deceived, robbed—in a word, hornswoggled?\n\nThe Little Warrior/Jill the Reckless, ch. 19 (1920/21)\n\nThe “High-Binders” was the name of a gang of lawless vagabonds that operated in New York early in the 19th century. The name subsequently came to be applied abusively to denote a swindler, especially a fraudulent politician.\n\nhailed a passing barouche (p. 14)\n\nSee Summer Moonshine.\n\nAlthough the barouche was the height of fashion in the first half of the 19th century, by the first half of the 20th century barouche-spotting had ceased to be a worthwhile activity, except during State processions. [Bertie is just using a jocular substitute for “taxicab” here, I think. —NM]\n\nact of kindness (p. 14) *\n\nThe Boy Scout requirement to do a daily act of kindness forms part of the plot of “Jeeves Takes Charge” (1916).\n\nthe dead past was the dead past (p. 15)\n\nSee Sam the Sudden.\n\nhep (p. 15) *\n\nSee Money for Nothing.\n\nup-and-down (p. 15) *\n\nSee The Inimitable Jeeves.\n\nwind-shields (p. 15) *\n\nSo far, searches in the OED and slang dictionaries have not yet uncovered this colloquialism for “eyeglasses”; this may be a Wodehouse coinage. He uses it in “The Story of Cedric” (1929; in Mr. Mulliner Speaking, 1929); of Gussie Fink-Nottle in The Mating Season, ch. 10 (1949); of Percy Gorringe in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 15 (1954). US edition of this book has windshields without hyphen.\n\nsalver (p. 15) *\n\nSee Leave It to Psmith.\n\nrising on stepping-stones of his dead self (p. 16)\n\nSee Something Fresh.\n\nto the gills (p. 17) *\n\nSee Carry On, Jeeves!.\n\nthe better the day, the better the deed (p. 17) *\n\nA conventional proverb, often used as an excuse for doing work on a Sunday or other religious holiday. The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs finds a 14th-century French source: a bon jour bone euvre.\n\ndistinguish between meum and tuum (p. 17)\n\nSee Something Fresh.\n\ngive Aunt Dahlia’s commission the miss-in-balk (p. 17)\n\nSee Love Among the Chickens.\n\nget outside another of Jeeves’s pick-me-ups (p.17)\n\nWodehouse did not invent the phrases “get outside” and “wrap oneself round” as humorous inversions of the act of putting food and drink inside oneself, but he did much to popularize these uses, beginning in 1906; see “How Kid Brady Joined the Press” and the endnote there on this phrase. [NM]\n\nharts panting for cooling streams (p. 17–18)\n\nAs the hart panteth after the water brooks,\n\nso panteth my soul after thee, O God.\n\nBible: Psalms 42:1\n\nThe phrase that Wodehouse uses is from a paraphrase of Psalm 42 made by Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady in their English Metrical Psalter (New Version), published in 1696:\n\nAs pants the hart for cooling streams\n\nWhen heated in the chase,\n\nSo longs my soul, O God, for Thee\n\nAnd Thy refreshing grace.\n\nSee also Money in the Bank.\n\nI wasn’t expecting the heart to leap up (p. 18)\n\nSee Summer Moonshine.\n\nIt was a silver cow (p. 18)\n\nFrom Bertie’s description, can this be anything other than the cow-creamer pictured, or another one by the same maker? See the Victoria & Albert Museum site for more on this item, made in London in 1758–59 by John Schuppe. It is indeed “about four inches high” (9.6 cm) and “six long” (14.8 cm). The V&A web page summary tab mentions that “Such was their renown that they merited inclusion in 20th-century literature: Bertie Wooster, the hero of tales by the author P. G. Wodehouse, found these cow creamers quite disgusting.” [NM]\n\ncudster (p. 18)\n\nClearly a term for “one that chews cud” but not included in the OED nor found in this sense in a Google Books search, so apparently a coinage by Wodehouse. [NM]\n\na different and a dreadful world (p. 19) *\n\nSee Very Good, Jeeves.\n\nskipping like the high hills (p. 20)\n\n“leaping” in the US first edition; omitted in the US magazine serial.\n\nThe voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.\n\nBible: Song of Solomon 2:8\n\nThe mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.\n\nBible: Psalms 114:4\n\nWhy leap ye, ye high hills?\n\nBible: Psalms 68:16\n\nThis was one of Wodehouse’s favourites and he continued using it almost to the end:\n\nWhen she went off unexpectedly under their feet like a bomb, strong men were apt to lose their poise and skip like the high hills.\n\nQuick Service, ch. 11 (1940)\n\nYou will start skipping like the high hills, not that I’ve ever seen high hills skip, or low hills for that matter.\n\nAunts Aren’t Gentlemen, ch. 16 (1974)\n\nThough none of the Biblical sources exactly matches Wodehouse’s usage, the example from Aunts Aren’t Gentlemen suggests that he may have had Psalm 114 in mind.\n\nup in the tenor clef (p. 20) *\n\nA fairly obscure reference to the symbol indicating that a five-line musical staff has middle C on the second line from the top. This is used most often for instruments whose ranges cross the usual division between bass and treble staves, such as the bassoon, cello, and trombone. Most vocal music for tenors is written on the treble staff an octave higher than it is sung, and denoted with a treble-clef symbol with a small figure 8 just below it, which is sometimes loosely called a tenor clef. In any event, this means that Bassett had a high voice, and shows that Wodehouse’s musical knowledge was greater than sometimes claimed.\n\nin the neighbourhood of Sloane Square (p. 20)\n\nSloane Square lies south-east of Brompton Oratory, from which, by the shortest route “down byways and along side streets,” it is about 1 km distant.\n\nturned off at the main (p. 20) *\n\nThe US equivalent would be in reference to electricity switched off at the fuse box or circuit-breaker panel.\n\nChapter 2 (pp. 21–36)\n\nmy earlier adventures with Gussie Fink-Nottle (p. 21) *\n\nRecounted in Right Ho, Jeeves (1934).\n\na tidal wave of telegrams (p. 21) *\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 3.\n\nto re-establish the mens sana in corpore what-not (p. 22)\n\nBertie is quoting the Roman satirist Juvenal (55–130 AD):\n\nOrandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano\n\nOur prayers should be for a sound mind in a healthy body\n\nSatires, X, 356\n\nI sank into a c. and passed an agitated h. over the b. (p. 22)\n\nSeveral possible interpretations of this sentence come to mind:\n\nI sank into a coma and passed an agitated hour over the bedclothes;\n\nor, I sank into a canter and passed an agitated horse over the bridge;\n\nor, I sank into a crouch and passed an agitated hawser over the bow . . .\n\n. . . but the likeliest is: I sank into a chair and passed an agitated hand over the brow.\n\nall of a twitter (p. 22) *\n\nSee The Inimitable Jeeves.\n\nthe young seigneur (p. 22)\n\nA seigneur is a feudal lord, in this case used figuratively to describe Bertie’s status as Jeeves’s employer.\n\nlighted a feverish cigarette (p. 22)\n\nAn example of one of Wodehouse’s favourite devices, the transferred epithet. There are other examples later in this chapter and in ch. 5.\n\nprivate school (p. 23) *\n\nSee p. 62, below.\n\ntelegraph … post office (p. 23) *\n\nSee p. 43, below.\n\nYes, that’s all very well… (p. 23) *\n\nFor one who had chided Bingo Little as a wasteful telegraphist in “The Metropolitan Touch” (1922; in The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923), Bertie is surprisingly wordy here.

The OED cites Wodehouse’s use of it in The Inimitable Jeeves (1923; originally in the 1922 story “Aunt Agatha Takes the Count”).\n\nhoggish slumber (p. 25) *\n\nNorman Murphy (A Wodehouse Handbook) suggests a derivation from Shakespeare, either “hog in sloth” from King Lear or “swinish sleep” from Macbeth. But the immediate and precise source must be Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Ebb Tide (1893):\n\nfrom the moment he rolled up the chart, his hours were passed in slavish self-indulgence or in hoggish slumber.\n\nmy fluttering old aspen (p. 25) *\n\nSee Right Ho, Jeeves.\n\nMay green fly attack his roses (p. 26) *\n\nSee Something Fishy.\n\nMay all his hens get the staggers (p. 26)\n\nThe “staggers,” otherwise described as dizziness or vertigo, is not a disease but a symptom of some malady, such as lack of drinking water or worms in the nostrils. It affects mostly fat or over-fed birds. A bird afflicted with the staggers will often shake its body and turn round and round until it falls over and dies.\n\nwhite ants, if there are any in England (p. 26)\n\nThere aren’t. “White ants” are termites, of the order Isoptera. Although not related to the ants (cockroaches are closer relatives), they are similarly social, living in colonies which may contain as many as a million individuals. They live in warm climates, especially in the tropics, where their huge mounds are a common feature. Termites are omnivorous and frequently do great damage, especially to wooden buildings and structures.\n\nOf the 2000 or so known species of Isoptera, only two occur naturally in Europe, one confined to the Mediterranean coastlands, the other ranging as far north as northern Italy and the Bordeaux region of France.\n\nthis Machiavelli sicked him on to it (p. 27)\n\nSee A Damsel in Distress.\n\ncigarette … advertisements, ought to have been nonchalant (p. 29) *\n\nA slogan for Murad cigarettes; see this 1929 example.\n\nbradawl (p. 29) *\n\nSee A Damsel in Distress.\n\nthrough the seat (p. 29) *\n\nThe monstrous word affected Jeff like a bradawl through the seat of the trousers.\n\nMoney in the Bank, ch. 8 (1942)\n\nIt was Pongo who spoke next, as if impelled to utterance by a jab in the trouser seat from a gimlet or bradawl.\n\nUncle Dynamite, ch. 9.1 (1948)\n\nIndeed, she shot up as if a gimlet had suddenly penetrated the cushions and embedded itself in her person.\n\nSally Painter in Uncle Dynamite, ch. 11.4 (1948)\n\nHe quivered as if some hidden hand had thrust a bare bodkin through the seat of his chair.\n\nBarmy in Wonderland, ch. 11 (1952)\n\nHe could indeed scarcely have started more violently if a bradawl had come through the seat of the deck chair in which he was reclining and impaled his lower slopes to the depth of an inch and a quarter.\n\nCompany for Henry, ch. 8.2 (1967)\n\nIn fact, I jumped about six inches, as if a skewer or knitting-needle had come through the seat of my chair.\n\nMuch Obliged, Jeeves, ch. 6 (1971)\n\ngetting your hooks on the thing (p. 29) *\n\nSlang for hands; OED cites uses from 1829 on, including a 1926 tract from the Society for Pure English defining get one’s hooks on as “get hold of.”\n\nmaking … heavy weather (p. 29) *\n\nAllowing one’s emotions to be stormy; making a fuss about something. Wodehouse used Heavy Weather as the title of a 1933 Blandings Castle novel.\n\nyou follow me, Watson? (p. 29)\n\nOnly once does Sherlock Holmes pose a question in this form to Doctor Watson:\n\n“And when I raise my hand — so — you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.

No, dash it, that’s not right,” said Monty, musing.\n\nHeavy Weather, ch. 5 (1933)\n\nIt is at moments like this that a man realizes that the only course for him to pursue, if he is to retain his self-respect, is to unship the velvet hand in the iron glove, or, rather, the other way about.\n\nJeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 1 (1954)\n\nShe said it sounded as if Jeeves must be something like her father—she had never met him—Jeeves, I mean, not her father, whom of course she had met frequently—and she told me I had been quite right in displaying the velvet hand in the iron glove, or rather the other way around, isn’t it, because it never did to let oneself be bossed.\n\nEmerald Stoker in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, ch. 2 (1963)\n\nover my head like the sword of — who was the chap? (p. 29)\n\nDamocles was his name. According to legend, Damocles was a sycophant at the court of Dionysius the Elder, tyrant (i.e. ruler) of the Sicilian city of Syracuse in the 4th century BC. He so persistently praised the power and happiness of Dionysius that the tyrant ordered a banquet at which Damocles was the guest of honour but at which he found himself seated beneath a sword that was suspended from the ceiling by a single horse hair. Dionysius explained that the rank and power of the tyrant were no less precarious. The story is told by the Roman orator Cicero in his Tusculan Dispuations (Book V, 61)\n\nthe middle of the pheasant season (p. 29)\n\nIn England and Wales, the pheasant season begins on 1st October and continues until 1st February.\n\nbeetled off (p. 30) *\n\nSee Very Good, Jeeves.\n\nate a moody slice of cold bacon (p. 30)\n\nSee p. 22.\n\nwins the mottled oyster (p. 30) *\n\nThough the general idea is clear from the context, the precise meaning of this one is obscure. The phrase has not yet been found in slang dictionaries, but it is not a Wodehouse coinage; Google Books scans of the old US humor magazine Life (not the more familiar photo-journalistic magazine of the same name founded in 1936) show a 1927 usage: “I have seen many terrible college movies in my day, but this one wins the mottled oyster. It is just plain awful.” The film reviewed, The Fair Co-Ed, starred Marion Davies as “Marion Bright,” and if the rest of the writing was as formulaic as that pun on “merry and bright” one can see why the reviewer was not impressed.\n\nWodehouse, however, made the term famous by using it here, and by giving the name of The Mottled Oyster to a nightclub in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954) and Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (1972). The name was adopted by a real-life bar in the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in Chelsea, London, and by a chapter of The Wodehouse Society in San Antonio, Texas.\n\npersonal effects in the dickey (p. 30)\n\nSee Summer Moonshine.\n\nsinging some light snatch (p. 30) *\n\nA short portion of a melody or tune, an excerpt from a song.\n\nhad circumstances been different (p. 30) *\n\nHad circumstances been different from what they were—not, of course, that they ever are—I might have derived no little enjoyment from this after-dinner saunter…\n\nJeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 11 (1954)\n\nthe bowed-downer did the heart become (p. 30)\n\nSee Sam the Sudden.\n\nthe situation is a lulu (p. 31) *\n\nThe OED says that the slang term lulu is originally American for something remarkable or wonderful, often used ironically. One 1886 citation is hyphenated lu-lu; the next one, without the hyphen, is from George Ade’s Artie (1896), known to be one of Wodehouse’s sources for American colloquial speech.\n\nstart [life] as an orphan (p. 31) *\n\nRather a cruel wish for one’s mother, isn’t that?

It runs through the heart of Istanbul, past several Ottoman palaces, and it is said (in Brewer’s Dictionary, for example) that if the sultan wished to be rid of one of his harem, the unfortunate woman was tied in a sack and thrown into the Bosphorus.\n\ngoing down for the third time in the soup (p. 31) *\n\nThe folk wisdom about “going down for three times” before drowning is debunked at The Straight Dope.

An audio interview with the FBI historian disputes that to some extent; in fact the FBI got its name only in 1935, and even when they came out with the Ten Most Wanted list in 1950 the criminals on it were not ranked or numbered.\n\nMore applicable to Wodehouse is the use in the book (originally by Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, revised by Lindsay and Crouse) and lyrics (by Cole Porter, to his own music) of the 1934 musical Anything Goes. Some of the plot complications involve the hero, Billy Crocker, being mistaken for “Snake Eyes” Johnson, Public Enemy Number One; he becomes involved with “Moonface” Martin, who is dissatisfied with his ranking of Public Enemy Number Thirteen and wants to pull off a big crime to rate higher on the list.\n\nIn Wodehouse’s 1936 novel Laughing Gas, George, one of the supposed kidnappers, has hopes to become a screenwriter, and describes his story about another Public Enemy Number Thirteen, who is superstitious about the number 13 and wants to change his ranking with a crime.\n\nthe native hue of resolution (p. 33)\n\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\n\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\n\nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,\n\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\n\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\n\nAnd lose the name of action.\n\nShakespeare: Hamlet, Act III Scene 1\n\nSee Shakespeare Quotations and Allusions in Wodehouse for more references to this passage and a discussion of pith versus pitch. See also p. 201 below.\n\nabout the tonnage of Jessie Matthews (p. 33)\n\nOne of 11 children of a Soho costermonger, Jessie Matthews (1907–1981) was a popular musical comedy star of the 1930s. Ill-health and the onset of war put an end to her film career, but she later made a come-back as a radio performer, playing the title role in BBC’s long-running soap drama, “Mrs Dale’s Diary.”\n\nJessie Matthews was variously described as “gamine” and “waif-like.”\n\n[The American first edition (Doubleday, Doran, 1938) has “about the tonnage of Maureen O’Sullivan” here. Probably best remembered as Jane to Johnny Weissmuller’s Tarzan in five films, the Irish-born actress (1911–1998) was slight (5′3″) and slender; her career was busy during the 1930s and by her own choice less intense afterward, though she continued acting in films and TV movies into the 1990s. PGW knew her in Hollywood and dedicated his 1931 novel Hot Water to her. Neither actress is mentioned in the US magazine serial. —NM]\n\nstately home of E.

Browning’s poem is not connected with the ballad, nor is there any connection between Shakespeare “Childe Roland” and the paladin Roland of mediaeval romances.\n\n[But Browning’s poem does cite Edgar’s mad song in Lear. Jeeves will utter the same allusion in Ch. 5 of The Mating Season, and Bertie will then later look into the history of the quotation. —NM]\n\nrather deeply graven on my heart (p. 34) *\n\nSee Bill the Conqueror.\n\nthe sort of eye that can open an oyster at sixty paces (p. 34) *\n\n“But watch out for Spode.

Josef Stalin’s “Great Purge” in the Soviet Union in the mid-1930s was a pretext to consolidate his power and eliminate political opposition; something on the order of a million people were executed or died in prison or exile. Although the show trials of former leaders were reported, the full extent of the purges was not known in the West at the time Wodehouse was writing, and I suspect Wodehouse would not have referred to it in a humorous book if he had known then what the world learned later.\n\ndecent habiliments (p. 37) *\n\nHistorically, this phrase refers to adequate or appropriate clothing; the earliest usage so far found is in a play, A Jovial Crew, or, the Merry Beggars by Richard Brome (1641), in which a beggar asks for money “to furnish us with linen, and some decent habiliments.”\n\nBertie’s reference, of course, is to the distinction between country tweeds and the more muted colors and patterns suitable for London attire.

Mary Dugan (Shearer), a Broadway showgirl, is accused of killing her lover, a rich playboy, by stabbing him with a knife. Dugan is defended by a lawyer friend who, however, decides not to cross-examine witnesses and later withdraws mysteriously from the case (and is finally unmasked as the real killer).\n\nThere was a re-make in 1941, directed by Norman Z. McLeod.\n\nNeither version featured cow-creamers, baronets or would-be dictators.\n\nthoughtfully sucking the muzzle of his gun (p. 41) *\n\nRather unexpected for such a forceful character as Spode. Compare the ineffectual characters Motty, Lord Pershore, in “Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest” (1917), “sucking the knob of his stick”; Eggy Mannering, in Laughing Gas, ch. 14 (1936), “sitting on the edge of a chair, sucking the knob of his stick”; and Cosmo Wisdom, in Cocktail Time, ch. 5 (1958), “nervously sucking the knob of his umbrella.”\n\nCompare also Freddie Threepwood, who “chewed the knob of his cane” in Something New, ch. 2 (1915), and Ferdinand Dibble, who “gnawed the handle of his putter” in “The Heart of a Goof” (1923).\n\nonce lived in Arcady (p. 42)\n\nSee Something Fresh.\n\npancake (p. 43) *\n\nThe OED has no citations for this slang usage, but Green’s Dictionary of Slang finds 1930s examples from Damon Runyon of its use for an attractive young woman.\n\ncut-and-thrust stuff (p. 43) *\n\nSee Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit.\n\ntelegram … telephone … post office (p. 43) *\n\nIn Britain the General Post Office was given a monopoly on telegraph communication in 1869 and a near-monopoly on telephone services by 1912.

According to the story, he set off for the East, accompanied by his friend, Bertrand d’Allamanon, but became very ill and feared that he would die without ever seeing his lady. When their ship neared land, Bertrand went ashore and hurried to ask the Countess if she would agree to come and meet her unknown lover, which she did, whereupon Rudel showed his gratitude by pegging out in front of her. No doubt taken aback by this display of gross bad manners and wishing to avoid a recurrence, Melisande hastily donned widow’s clothes and retired to a convent.\n\nThere was indeed a historical Geoffrey or Jaufré Rudel, prince of Blaye or Blaia, and “in all probability” he went on crusade in the year 1147, but apparently the other details of the legend are unsubstantiated. The story was elaborated many times in literature, including by John Graham (1836), Robert Browning, and Giosuè Carducci (1888).\n\ncami-knickers (p. 45) *\n\nA one-piece female undergarment combining a camisole and knickers, first cited in the OED in 1915. (Thanks to Stefan Nilsson for pointing us to this image.)\n\nEven at the Drones Club, where the average of intellect is not high, it was often said of Archibald that, had his brain been constructed of silk, he would have been hard put to it to find sufficient material to make a canary a pair of cami-knickers.\n\n“The Reverent Wooing of Archibald” in Mr. Mulliner Speaking (1929)\n\np’fft (p. 46) *\n\nThe OED lists many varying forms of phut, pfft, phfft and so forth, dating from the late nineteenth century, originally onomatopoetic for a small explosion or release of air under pressure or the noise of the passage of a bullet. American gossip columnist Walter Winchell popularized it as an adjective for a failed romance or marriage; he usually spelled it phffft. In other contexts for failure, Wodehouse often uses phut:\n\n“he made it clear all right that my allowance has gone phut again.”\n\nBingo Little speaking of his Uncle Mortimer in “Bingo and the Little Woman” (1922; as chs. 17–18 of The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923)\n\nMy closely-reasoned scheme had gone phut.\n\n“The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy” (1924; in Carry On, Jeeves!, 1925)\n\nBut in the sense of a failed romance, Wodehouse uses p’fft once more:\n\nI had the disquieting impression that it wouldn’t take too much to make the Stilton-Florence axis go p’fft again…\n\nJeeves and the Feudal Spirit, ch. 3 (1954)\n\ncrossword puzzle … a shrewd “Emu” (p. 46) *\n\nSee Sam the Sudden for the crossword fad in general.

Black Shorts (p. 54)\n\nRoderick Spode and his “Black Shorts” are a parody of Oswald Mosley (1896–1980), founder of the British Union of Fascists, whose members, particularly the more extremist ones, wore distinctive black shirts.\n\nThroughout his career, Mosley showed an inability to settle within the confines of a political party. At the 1918 General Election, he won Harrow for the Conservatives, becoming the youngest MP in Parliament, but at the 1922 election, disillusioned with the Conservative Party, he contested (and won) Harrow as an Independent. Two years later, he joined the Labour Party and, after the 1929 election, served as a member of Ramsay MacDonald’s government, only to resign the following year. In 1931, he founded his own party, the New Party, but it failed to win a single seat in the 1931 election, and after meeting Mussolini in Italy, Mosley disbanded the party in 1932 and founded the British Union of Fascists. In 1936, Mosley, by now a Nazi sympathiser, married his second wife, Diana Mitford, at a ceremony which took place in the Berlin home of German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in front of six guests, one of them Adolf Hitler. In May 1940, Mosley and his wife were detained under Defence Regulations as persons likely “to endanger the safety of the realm” and the BUF was banned a few days later. The Mosleys were released in 1943, on grounds of his ill-health, and, though they remained in England for a few years after the war, they finally left in 1949, eventually settling in France.\n\none of those detectives (p. 54)\n\nThis is the sort of deductive exercise at which Sherlock Holmes excels:\n\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n\n“A Scandal in Bohemia,” in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\n\n“Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”\n\n“The Red-Headed League,” in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\n\n“When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him.

It tells the story of two children, Tyltyl and Mytyl, the son and daughter of a poor woodcutter, who are sent off by the Fairy Bérylune to search the world for the Blue Bird of Happiness. After much searching, they return home to find that the Blue Bird has been in their bird-cage all the time.\n\nFrom the programme for the revival of the play at London’s Haymarket Theatre in 1912: “The Blue Bird, inhabitant of the pays bleu, the fabulous blue country of our dreams, is an ancient symbol in the folk-lore of Lorraine, and stands for happiness.” Tenor Jan Peerce’s hugely popular 1945 record “The Bluebird of Happiness” served to keep the expression in the public mind.\n\nThe play has been filmed several times, twice as a silent film, in 1910 and 1918, and most famously in 1940, with Shirley Temple playing the role of Mytyl. A further film, in 1976, with Patsy Kensit as Mytyl and Elizabeth Taylor playing the part of Bérylune, was a resounding failure.\n\nThose who make the nation’s songs (so much more admirable than its laws) advise us to look for the silver lining, to seek the Blue Bird, to put all our troubles in a great big box and sit on the lid and grin.\n\nBill the Conqueror, ch. 2.2 (1924)\n\nIt had a dullness, a lack of tone. It was the voice of a butler who has lost the bluebird.\n\n“The Crime Wave at Blandings” (1936; in Lord Emsworth and Others, 1937)\n\nThat night [Bingo] dressed for dinner moodily. He was unable to discern the bluebird.\n\n“All’s Well with Bingo” (1937; in UK edition of Eggs, Beans and Crumpets, 1940)\n\nIn that shop, on the other hand, he had given the impression of a man who has found the bluebird.\n\nSir Watkyn Bassett in The Code of the Woosters, ch. 3 (1938)\n\nBut, unlike him, she had not found the bluebird.\n\nMoney in the Bank, ch. 22 (1942)\n\n“I saw no ray of hope. It looked to me as if the bluebird had thrown in the towel and formally ceased to function.”\n\nJoy in the Morning, ch. 1 (1946)\n\nBut it takes more than that to buck a fellow up permanently who is serving an indeterminate sentence in a place like Deverill Hall, and it was not long before I was in somber mood again, trying to find the bluebird but missing it by a wide margin.\n\nThe Mating Season, ch. 7 (1949)\n\n“The sun shining and the bluebird back once more at the old stand.”\n\n“Jeeves Makes an Omelet” (1959; in A Few Quick Ones)\n\nThe hors d’oeuvres seem to whisper that the sun will some day shine once more, the cold salmon with tartare sauce points out that though the skies are dark, the silver lining will be along at any moment, and with the fruit salad or whatever it may be that tops off the meal, there comes a growing conviction that the bluebird, though admittedly asleep at the switch of late, has not formally gone out of business.\n\nThe Ice in the Bedroom, ch. 9 (1961)\n\nCrispin … was wearing the unmistakable air of a man who has failed to find the bluebird.\n\nThe Girl in Blue, ch. 12.3 (1970)\n\na carefree cat on hot bricks (p. 55)\n\nThe idiomatic expression “like a cat on hot bricks” (in US, “on a hot tin roof”) means “uneasy, or very nervous, and unable to keep still.” Wodehouse presumably wishes us to understand that Sir Watkyn was behaving in this agitated manner, but not from any uneasiness (hence “carefree”).\n\nSee also The Girl in Blue.\n\nclicked (p. 55) *\n\nIn this sense, been successful in his wooing; had his proposal accepted.\n\n“I tried to muster up the nerve, but we got to Southampton without my having clicked. What a dashed difficult thing a proposal is to bring off, isn’t it!”\n\nEustace Hignett in Three Men and a Maid, ch. 8 (1922)\n\n“Keep steadily before you the fact that almost anybody can get married if they only plug away at it. Look at this man Bessemer, for instance, Ronnie’s man that I told you about. As ugly a devil as you would wish to see outside the House of Commons, equipped with number sixteen feet and a face more like a walnut than anything. And yet he has clicked.”\n\nMoney for Nothing, ch. 7 (1928)\n\n“He made his presence felt right from the beginning to an almost unbelievable extent, and actually clicked as early as the fourth day out.”\n\n“Fate” (1931; in Young Men in Spats, 1936)\n\n“I don’t want to shatter your dreams and all that, but are you sure you’ve clicked in that direction quite so solidly as you imagine?”\n\nSummer Moonshine, ch. 8 (1937)\n\n“Yes, you can start pricing wedding presents.

Just before I came here.”\n\n“You really clicked, did you?”\n\nA Pelican at Blandings, ch. 2 (1969)\n\nhauled up her slacks about me (p. 56)\n\nWodehouse employs the same phrase elsewhere, though it does not seem to be in common use. From the context, it seems to mean making a special effort or employing exaggeration when describing something or someone.\n\nAs for Clarence, how easy it would be to haul up one’s slacks to practically an unlimited extent on the subject of his emotions at this time.\n\n“The Goal-Keeper and the Plutocrat,” in The Man Upstairs\n\nSecondly, as there appears to be no law of libel whatsoever in this great and free country, we shall be enabled to haul up our slacks with a considerable absence of restraint.\n\nPsmith, Journalist, ch. 9\n\nOf course, if in the vein, I might do something big in the way of oratory. I am a plain, blunt man, but I feel convinced that, given the opportunity, I should haul up my slacks to some effect.\n\nPsmith in the City, ch. 15\n\nHe hauled up his slacks thus:\n\nAunts Aren’t Gentlemen, ch. 20 (1974)\n\nSee also The Inimitable Jeeves.\n\na cross between Robert Taylor and Einstein (p. 56)\n\nRobert Taylor (1911–1969) was a film star and matinee-idol; nicknamed “the man with the perfect profile,” his good looks frequently secured him leading roles for which he then received unfavourable reviews from critics who could not bring themselves to accept that so handsome an actor could act.\n\nAlbert Einstein, who formulated the theory of relativity and turned classical physics on its head, needs, as they say, no introduction.\n\nOne hopes that Gussie is referring to Robert Taylor’s looks and Einstein’s brains, as the alternative hardly bears thinking about.\n\nthe full moon influences the love life (p. 57)\n\nThis is certainly true of some undersea creatures. For example, seahorses (Hippocampus spp) perform their mating rituals around the time of the full moon, while ostracods (tiny crustaceans) synchronise their mating cycles with the phases of the moon.\n\ndumb chums (p. 57) *\n\nIn the sense of “without speech” rather than “unintelligent,” this is a frequent phrase for Wodehouse’s characters when referring to pets or other animal friends. In fact the first OED citation for “dumb chums” is from Wodehouse:\n\nArrived at man’s estate, he [Gussie] retired to the depths of the country and gave his life up to these dumb chums.\n\nRight Ho, Jeeves, ch. 1 (1934)\n\nAn earlier usage:\n\n“…Our Dumb Chums’ League, of which I am perpetual vice-president”\n\nOrlando Wotherspoon in “Open House” (1932; in Mulliner Nights, 1933)\n\nNorman Murphy noted in A Wodehouse Handbook that the above league was clearly based on Our Dumb Friends League, an animal welfare charity founded in 1897 in London. It used a Blue Cross emblem for its fundraising campaigns, and by 1950 changed its organizational name to The Blue Cross.\n\nAnd others, showing variety of species:\n\nI can’t see why Jeeves shouldn’t go down in legend and song. Daniel did, on the strength of putting in half an hour or so in the lions’ den and leaving the dumb chums in a condition of suavity and camaraderie…\n\nThank You, Jeeves, ch. 18 (1934)\n\n“This girl Dahlia’s family, you see, was one of those animal-loving families, and the house, he tells me, was just a frothing maelstrom of dumb chums. As far as the eye could reach, there were dogs scratching themselves and cats scratching the furniture. I believe, though he never met it socially, there was even a tame chimpanzee somewhere on the premises.”\n\nA well-informed Crumpet recounting Freddie Widgeon’s tale in “Good-bye to All Cats” (1934; in Young Men in Spats, 1936)\n\nThe six Pekes accompanied [Bingo] into the library and sat waiting for their coffee-sugar, but he was too preoccupied to do the square thing by the dumb chums.\n\n“Bingo and the Peke Crisis” (1937; in Eggs, Beans and Crumpets, 1940)\n\n“In a nutshell, then, Aunt Hermione advised Aunt Dora to wait till Prue had popped out with the dumb chums and then go through her effects for possible compromising correspondence.”\n\nFreddie Threepwood, speaking of his cousin taking the dogs for a walk, in Full Moon, ch. 3.6 (1947)\n\n…in this shovel one noted what seemed to be frogs. Yes, on a closer inspection, definitely frogs. [Constable Dobbs] gave the shovel a jerk, shooting the dumb chums through the air as if he had been scattering confetti.\n\nThe Mating Season, ch. 21 (1949)\n\n“I see you’re lushing up the dumb chums.”\n\nFreddie Widgeon notes that Mr. Cornelius is giving lettuce to his rabbits in Ice in the Bedroom, ch. 1 (1961).\n\nAnd note the article “Dumb Chums at Riverhead” (Punch, September 7, 1955) about a man who raised armadillos.\n\nlike a Pekingese taking a pill (p. 57)\n\nWodehouse is, no doubt, writing here from personal experience: Pekingese were their favourite dogs and even in Berlin, after Wodehouse was released from internment and Ethel joined him, she was accompanied by their Pekingese, Wonder.\n\nout of the night that covered me (p. 58)\n\nOut of the night that covers me,\n\nBlack as the Pit from pole to pole,\n\nI thank whatever gods may be\n\nFor my unconquerable soul.\n\nWilliam Ernest Henley: “Invictus” (1875)\n\nHe eats a lot of fish (p. 59) *\n\nSee Very Good, Jeeves for a discussion of this topic.\n\nI played on you as on a lot of stringed instruments (p. 59) *\n\nSee The Clicking of Cuthbert.\n\nsafely under the wire (p. 60) *\n\nThat is, safely married; a figurative allusion to the imaginary wire across the finish line of a horse-racing track.\n\nhunting newts in Africa (p. 60) *\n\nBertie’s adaptation for Gussie of the usual rejected suitor’s trip to shoot grizzly bears in the Rocky Mountains; see A Damsel in Distress.\n\nChapter 4 (pp. 62–86)\n\nas you jog along (p. 62) *\n\nIn recent years, the verb jog has so often been used for running at a moderate pace for aerobic exercise that we tend to forget its original senses. Transitively, to jog something meant to shake it up, give it a jerky push or nudge. Intransitively, to jog was to move unsteadily or as if shaken, “to move with small shocks like those of a low trot” (Samuel Johnson). So Bertie’s usage here is less like a smooth trip around a fitness track and more like being jolted continually through life by random events.\n\nleap . . . like a gaffed salmon (p. 62)\n\nLord Emsworth … leaped on his settee like a gaffed trout.\n\nHeavy Weather, ch. 17 (1933)\n\nHe had been sitting hard by, staring at the ceiling, and he now gave a sharp leap like a gaffed salmon and upset a small table containing a vase, a bowl of potpourri, two china dogs, and a copy of Omar Kháyyám bound in limp leather.\n\nTuppy in Right Ho, Jeeves, ch. 14 (1934)\n\nBingo, who had given a sharp, convulsive leap like a gaffed salmon, reassembled himself.\n\n“The Editor Regrets,” in Eggs, Beans and Crumpets (1940)\n\nIt caused Lord Shortlands to leap like a gaffed salmon and Terry to quiver all over.\n\nSpring Fever, ch. 14 (1948)\n\nA gaff is a hook used to land large fish; because a gaffed fish is not dead, it will usually writhe convulsively.\n\nprivate school (p. 62) *\n\nThe distinction between private and public schools in Britain at this era was not the same as in modern American usage. Neither was government-run, like the American public school system. (Government-run schools in Britain had other names such as state school or council school.) A British public school, like Eton, Harrow, or Wodehouse’s alma mater Dulwich, was chartered as an institution for public benefit, with an endowment and a board of trustees or governors; in the USA it would be classified as a nonprofit organization. A private school in Britain meant one that was privately owned and operated as a commercial venture; typically the headmaster and the proprietor would be the same person. Thus any money not spent on feeding the students would mean more in the headmaster’s pocket, so it was no wonder that Bertie was attracted by the possibility of a late-night biscuit.\n\nbiscuits (p. 62) *\n\nEven in the US first edition book, Bertie uses the British term for what Americans would call cookies.

Wodehouse uses it in the sense of quash, finish off:\n\nthis development absolutely put the bee on the wedding. Everybody sympathized with Claude and said it was out of the question that he could dream of getting married.\n\n“No Wedding Bells for Him” (1923; in Ukridge, 1924)\n\nthe old boy most fortunately got the idea that I was off my rocker and put the bee on the proceedings.\n\n“Without the Option” (1925; in Carry On, Jeeves!, 1925/27)\n\nYes, all the love which I had lavished on this girl two years ago and which I had supposed her crisp remarks at Cannes had put the bee on for good was working away at the old stand once more, as vigorously as ever.\n\nLaughing Gas, ch. 23 (1936)\n\nI put the bee on this suggestion with the greatest promptitude.\n\nStiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, ch. 24 (1963)\n\nGreen’s Dictionary of Slang derives this sense of bee from the initial letter of “bag” as in the phrase “put the bag on” meaning to halt or interfere with. This sense is distinguished from another initial-letter abbreviation of put the bite on (with a play on bee as something that stings) meaning to blackmail, to extort, to press for a loan.\n\n“I’m in the soup.”\n\n“Up to the thorax.” (p. 64) *\n\nFor “in the soup,” and some of its variants, see The Inimitable Jeeves; also note p. 31 above and p. 204 below.\n\nIn mammals, the thorax is the chest, so Gussie is more deeply involved than one who has consommé splashing about his ankles, is knee-deep in the bisque, or is waist high in the gumbo; but at least he is not yet going down for the third time as above.\n\ntrust in a higher power (p. 64) *\n\nSee Carry On, Jeeves!.\n\nthe lemon (p. 65) *\n\nOne’s own head; see The Inimitable Jeeves.\n\nexclamash (p. 66) *\n\nExclamation, clipped as in the 1920s craze for shortened words, such as the Gershwin song “ ’S Wonderful” (1927), whose verse rhymes humble fash and tender pash.\n\nAnd falls to earth (p. 66)\n\nI shot an arrow into the air,\n\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where;\n\nFor, so swiftly it flew, the sight\n\nCould not follow it in its flight.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow: “The Arrow and the Song” (1845)\n\nsole meunière (p. 67) *\n\nSee Sam the Sudden.\n\nIt biteth like a serpent (p. 67)\n\nLook not though upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.\n\nAt the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.\n\nBible: Proverbs 23:31–32\n\nSee also Money in the Bank and Joy in the Morning, ch. 1.\n\ndoing the heavy father (p. 67) *\n\nSee Money for Nothing.\n\nforbidding banns (p. 67) *\n\nSee Uncle Fred in the Springtime.\n\ndrop a silent tear (p. 68)\n\nBut we forbear, out of sympathy to our readers’ bones.

Appeals from lower courts are heard by one of two Appellate Committees, each of which consists of at least five Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (‘Law Lords’). The Law Lords, of whom there are twelve active judicially, are usually appointed from the ranks of the Lords Justices of Appeal.\n\nAppellate Committees usually sit in a House of Lords Committee Room but their decisions are delivered in the Chamber of the House of Lords, preserving the “fiction” that it is the Court of Parliament which hears appeals.\n\nWith the development of the European Union, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, both in Strasbourg, have become the final courts of appeal for some matters that would previously have terminated in the House of Lords.\n\nSee also Money in the Bank.\n\nreturning to the res (p. 72)\n\nThe crux of the matter, the point at issue (or “point at tissue” as PC Oates would say) (Latin: the thing).\n\nwhat I believe is known as a moue (p. 72)\n\nFrench: a grimace of discontent, a pout.\n\nseeking whom he may devour (p. 72)\n\nBe sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:\n\nBible: 1 Peter 5:8\n\nJustice of the Peace (p. 72)\n\nJustices of the Peace, commonly known as magistrates, represent the lowest tier in the judicial system. Their origins date back to 1195, when Richard I commissioned certain knights as “Keepers of the Peace,” to maintain the peace in areas of unrest. JPs are unqualified and unpaid (unlike “stipendiary magistrates,” who are qualified lawyers) and were traditionally appointed from among the landed gentry, though they are now drawn from a much broader spectrum of the population. JPs, usually sitting as a “bench” of three, preside in magistrates’ courts, where they deal with the overwhelming majority of criminal cases, either deciding cases and passing sentence themselves, or, in more serious cases, hearing the preliminary evidence in proceedings for commital to the Crown Court. Magistrates’ courts also deal with such non-criminal matters as applications for liquor licences, while a magistrate’s signature is required before certain legal documents, such as search warrants, can be served.\n\nStar Chamber (p. 72)\n\nThe Court of Star Chamber evolved out of the king’s royal council. During the reign of Henry VII, it developed into a separate judicial entity, distinct from the king’s council, primarily to hear appeals. Under Henry VIII, plaintiffs were encouraged to bring their cases directly to the Star Chamber, bypassing the lower courts entirely. From an early stage, the court could order torture, prison, and fines, but it did not have the power to impose the death sentence.\n\nThe power of the Court of Star Chamber grew considerably under James I and Charles I, who both used it to suppress anti-monarchist opposition; court sessions were held in secret (they had been held in public under the Tudors), there was no right of appeal, and punishment was both swift and severe to any enemy of the Crown. As a result, Star Chamber become a byword for Royalist abuse of power and, under the Long Parliament, in 1641, it was abolished. The name survives to designate arbitrary and secretive proceedings in opposition to personal rights and liberty.\n\nlooking like Judge Jeffreys (p. 72)\n\nGeorge Jeffreys, 1st Baron of Wem (1645–1689), was a lawyer who prospered during the reigns of Charles II, who appointed him Lord Chief Justice, and James II, under whom he was created a Baron, the first Lord Chief Justice to be ennobled while still in office. A few months later, in August 1685, he presided over a commission set up at Winchester to try those accused of complicity in the failed Monmouth rebellion. His conduct at Winchester led to him being branded “Hanging Judge Jeffreys” and the trials are now known to history as the “Bloody Assizes” — at least 320 people were executed and hundreds more were transported to work as slaves in the West Indies after trials which, in many cases, were a mockery of justice. James II, however, was sufficiently pleased that he rewarded Jeffreys with appointment as Lord Chancellor. When, in 1688, William of Orange invaded England and James fled the country, Jeffreys tried to do likewise, but he was recognised, arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died a few months later.\n\n[Reference omitted in US magazine serial.]\n\nputting on the black cap (p. 73)\n\nNot a cap, so much as a square of black silk, which a judge placed on his head before sentencing a prisoner to death.

I think it’s “ecstatic,” unless that’s the sort of rash you get on your face and have to use ointment for.\n\ndo the dialect (p. 74) *\n\nThis is the only instance so far found where the dialect is baby talk. Sometimes this phrase involves an actual English dialect, as of an ethnic joke or a reconstruction of an imagined conversation:\n\nMr. Bellamy … said that that reminded him of another, of which the protagonists were a couple of Scotsmen, Donald and Sandy. He apologized for not being able to do the dialect, and then did it, revealing these North Britons as a pair of eccentrics who conversed in a patois which was not exactly Cockney and yet not wholly negroid.\n\nBig Money, ch. 8 (1931)\n\n“I’ll put it on the mantelpiece, Dad,” no doubt the son had said. “It’ll look well up there,” to which the old gaffer had replied “Aye, lad, gormed if ’twon’t look gradely on the mantelpiece.” Or words to that effect. I can’t do the dialect, of course.\n\nStiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, ch. 10 (1963)\n\nBertie also uses it for earlier varieties of the English language:\n\nI was recalling the story … about the fellow who had written a book and his dog Diamond chewed up the manuscript; the point being what a decent chap the fellow was, because all he said was ‘Ah, Diamond, Diamond, you little know what you have done’. It ought to be ‘thou little knowest’ and ‘what thou hast done’, but I can’t do the dialect.\n\nAunts Aren’t Gentlemen, ch. 17 (1974)\n\n(In chapter 8 of the present book, Bertie tells the same story of Diamond and wavers between ancient and modern pronouns in the same way; see p. 155 below.)\n\nIn the voice of a well-informed Crumpet, or of Wodehouse himself, it can refer to foreign languages too:\n\nIt was the voice of the croupier, chanting his litany.\n\n“Cinquante louis à la banque. Un banco de mille.”\n\nI can’t do the dialect, you understand, but what he meant was that somebody holding the bank had run it up to a thousand francs.\n\n“Noblesse Oblige” (1934; in Young Men in Spats, 1936)\n\nThe snails you eat in France with garlic sauce … come mostly from Austria, and I was shocked to find that the Austrian boys who track them down get only sixty shillings for sixty pounds of them.

Both are pronounced “maudlin.”\n\nbefore he saw the light (p. 75) *\n\nAlthough Fr. Rob did not choose to include this in Biblia Wodehousiana, this phrase for a sudden religious conversion probably derives from Acts 9:1–4, in which Saul of Tarsus, while persecuting the disciples of Jesus, “came near Damascus, and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven” and the voice of Jesus asked why he was persecuting him. As a result of this experience he became a Christian evangelist, known as Paul the Apostle.\n\nhow the other three-quarters lives (p. 75) *\n\nA play on “how the other half lives”—a common phrase. See Thank You, Jeeves.\n\ncures souls (p. 75) *\n\nBertie is perpetrating a humorous archaism here, reaching back to the roots of the title of curate; both in the noun and verb sense, cure as relating to giving spiritual assistance and comfort is just as old in the language as the medical sense of treating disease. The OED, though, says that the verb sense of the spiritual care has become obsolete, while the noun sense is still used, commonly in the phrase “a cure of souls” and as adapted in the title of a curate.\n\nSee also A Damsel in Distress.\n\nlarge, lumbering Newfoundland puppy of a chap (p. 75) *\n\nAs a dancer, in fact, [Bill West] closely resembled a Newfoundland puppy trying to run across a field.\n\nUneasy Money, ch. 6 (1916)\n\nSam Marlowe is described in Sam the Sudden, ch. 12.2, as “something in between a cyclone and a large Newfoundland puppy dressed in bright tweeds.”\n\nden of the Secret Nine (p. 76) *\n\nAnd while I stood there, feeling like the hero when he discovers that he is trapped in the den of the Secret Nine, the door opened.\n\n“Without the Option” (1925; in Carry On, Jeeves!)\n\n“Well, I do seem properly trapped in the den of the Secret Nine, what?”\n\nMonty Bodkin, in Heavy Weather, ch. 11 (1933)\n\nAnd no more chance of getting him away from that malign influence than if he had been trapped in the underground cellar of the Secret Nine.\n\n“The Come-Back of Battling Billson” (1935; in Lord Emsworth and Others, 1937, and the US edition of Eggs, Beans and Crumpets, 1940)\n\nWhen you get trapped in the den of the Secret Nine, you want something a lot better than Gussie to help you keep the upper lip stiff.\n\nThe Mating Season, ch. 1 (1949)\n\nAssisted by the lift man, I got him out, and he then stoutly declined to go through our door, which he obviously assumed led to the Den of the Secret Nine.\n\nWodehouse, describing the first visit of his foxhound to his New York high-rise apartment on Park Avenue, in a letter to Bill Townend dated November 18, 1952 in Performing Flea.\n\n“Is Blandings Castle the den of the Secret Nine?

Wodehouse uses it here in the unrecorded sense of stealing a hat, and in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, to mean striking a blow to the head.\n\nhave a dekko (p. 78) *\n\nHave a look; British army slang from the 1890s, derived from Hindi dekho, imperative form of the verb “Look!”\n\nFreddie Threepwood . . .

The expression is now common, but its first recorded use, according to the OED, was by Wodehouse himself, in Right Ho, Jeeves, ch. 11 (1934) — “He should have had sense enough to see that he was throwing a spanner into the works.” [But see the notes to Leave It to Psmith for earlier Wodehouse uses beginning in 1920.

It also housed Americans taken prisoner during the war of 1812. After being unoccupied for over 30 years, it reopened in 1850 as a civilian prison for convicts sentenced to long terms of imprisonment or to hard labour. Both the prison and its surroundings are bleak and forbidding, and the prison has long been regarded as a place to which the most recalcitrant prisoners are consigned. Though the prison is by no means as “escape-proof” as is sometimes suggested, its isolated location and the rugged nature of the surrounding moorland add to the difficulties facing would-be escapers.\n\nlanded in the jug (p. 82) *\n\nImprisoned; see p. 161 below.\n\nants in the pants (p. 83) *\n\nThough even some of the earliest citations of this slang phrase refer to sexual excitement, Wodehouse uses it only in the sense of irritation, itchiness, fidgetiness, lack of repose or calm.\n\nThe limbs twitch, the eyeballs roll, the illusion that there are ants in his pants becomes more and more pronounced, until eventually the urge to be closer to the center of things grows so imperious that he yields to it.\n\nUncle Dynamite, ch. 14.1 (1948)\n\nThe irony of the thing was like ants in the pants, causing him to toss restlessly on the pillow.\n\n“The Shadow Passes” (1950, in Nothing Serious)\n\nHe shifted uneasily in his chair, like a man troubled with ants in the pants.\n\nJeeves in the Offing/How Right You Are, Jeeves, ch. 12 (1960)\n\nGawd-help-us (p. 83) *\n\nSee Aunts Aren’t Gentlemen.\n\n“Slip it across.” (p. 83) *\n\nHere, meaning simply “Hand it over.” Compare another form of the phrase at p. 116, below.\n\ncherishing . . . a harmless newt-fancier in his bosom (p. 84)\n\nAn allusion, as the subsequent mention of a snake confirms, to Aesop’s fable of the farmer and the snake. The farmer sees a snake frozen stiff with cold and, taking pity on it, puts it in his bosom to warm it, only to receive a fatal bite when the snake revives. To cherish a snake (or viper) in one’s bosom is to befriend someone who is treacherous and ungrateful.\n\nthis lax post-war world (p. 84)\n\nThe war in question is World War I, which had ended some 20 years earlier. With hindsight, we now know that World War II was less than 12 months away, but Bertie can be excused for not knowing that he is living in a lax pre-war world.\n\nMany chaps might have resented his tone.

Fairlie, who, in the late 1930s, succeeded “Sapper” (H. C. McNeile) as the author of Bulldog Drummond stories, is described by Barry Phelps (Wodehouse: Man and Myth) and Robert McCrum (Wodehouse: A Life) as one of Ethel Wodehouse’s “gentleman friends” and, according to McCrum, he stayed with the Wodehouses shortly after they moved to Hollywood.\n\nSee also Uncle Dynamite.\n\njust a black tie (p. 86) *\n\nShort way of referring to a dinner jacket (same as US tuxedo), the way one would dress for a family dinner; a more formal dinner with outside guests would warrant “white tie” including a tailcoat.
