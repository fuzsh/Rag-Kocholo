Now that he is beginning to be recognised as one of the most important writers of his generation, and his books are not just widely read but studied by students and critics all over the world, the time is ripe for the first scholarly critical edition of Conan Doyle’s works. Appropriately this is being undertaken by the Press of Edinburgh University, for he was a native of the city, and a student of its university from 1876 to 1881. While Conan Doyle is remembered primarily for the Sherlock Holmes stories, which defined the genre of crime fiction and introduced one of the world’s best-known fictional characters, his contributions as a writer and as a public figure were astonishingly broad and diverse. He was a campaigner for justice, an advocate of sport, an indefatigable traveller, a propagandist for British wars, and a proselytiser of Spiritualism. His writing reflects this variety of experience. He wrote in the genres of science fiction, horror, ghost stories, medical realism, detective fiction, adventure fiction, military history, poetry, journalism, spiritual literature, and autobiography. There is a need for an accurate and authoritative edition of this body of writing, and the Edinburgh Conan Doyle will be unique as a series of critical editions of Conan Doyle’s works. He was a professional author, with no other source of income once he had made the momentous decision, in 1891, to retire from medicine and live by his pen. He belonged to a busy and sociable literary culture which served a well-educated reading public of unprecedented size. This public had an appetite for magazines, from the prestigious Cornhill to the popular Tit-Bits, and it was common for writers like Conan Doyle, with the help of the first generation of professional literary agents, to publish instalments of their work in periodical form before they appeared as books. Conan Doyle’s own relationship with the Strand Magazine is wellknown, but his work appeared in scores of serial outlets, and his books too came out under the imprint of dozens of publishers, on both sides of the Atlantic. These different and developing print institutions, and his many collaborators, editors, publishers, illustrators, and critics, ensure that a study of Conan Doyle’s writing opens a broad window onto the literary and cultural history of his time. Meanwhile the range of topics he wrote about in his stories gives a sense of how his society thought of vii\n\ngeneral editor’s preface\n\nitself, its tastes and ideals, and its anxieties and fears. The extent of Conan Doyle’s writing posed a problem, and it was decided early in the planning stage that this edition should not be a Complete Works. (Of the collections published in his lifetime and supposedly under his supervision, neither the thirteen-volume Author’s Edition of 1903 nor the twenty-four-volume Crowborough Edition of 1930 claimed to be comprehensive.) Quite a lot of his writing was frankly ephemeral; though it is all interesting, some of it would not enhance his literary reputation if republished. Even so, in order to keep the edition to a manageable size, difficult decisions have had to be made. This edition has striven not only to include Conan Doyle’s best writing, but also to offer a sense of the prodigious range of his output, a variety which easily stands comparison with that of his near contemporaries Stevenson and Kipling. To give a biographical context for his writings, Memories and Adventures is the first volume to be published in this edition. So here alongside Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger, and Brigadier Gerard, we have medical and military stories, historical fiction, tales of mystery and imagination, campaigns against injustice, journalistic dispatches and Spiritualist polemic. These are all presented here in texts as authoritative as scholarship can make them, each volume having besides an extensive introduction, a textual essay giving a full history from conception to the various published incarnations and their critical reception, and a textual apparatus laying out in full the variations and emendations of the text from manuscript, if available, through serial publication and on to the books. Here the interested reader can study not only the final flourishing of Conan Doyle’s work but also its organic development, the hundreds of textual decisions involved in its process. Selection notwithstanding, the intention has been to present Conan Doyle’s literary work as a whole in such a way as to enable a clear judgement of his achievement.\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgements A scholarly edition is par excellence what practitioners of editing call a ‘social text’. There may have been only one Arthur Conan Doyle, but a critical edition of any of his books bears the fingerprints of many people, and institutions (if institutions can be said to leave fingerprints). It is a collaborative venture on many levels. For the editor whose name appears on the title page, it is an obligation, but also a pleasure, to acknowledge with thanks the contributions of those who helped to bring the volume to print. They can all take credit for whatever is of value in the enterprise, while responsibility for its errors and shortcomings belongs to the editor alone. At Edinburgh University Press, the instigator of the Edinburgh Edition of the Works of Arthur Conan Doyle was Jackie Jones. As the edition began to take shape, it passed into the capable hands of Michelle Houston, with assistance from Adela Rauchova. It is guided by an expert editorial board, and advised by anonymous reviewers. To all of these I extend grateful thanks. This volume benefited in the early stages from the work of my two brilliant research assistants at Hong Kong University, Rita Kelly and Caitlin Vandertop. Their painstaking work, particularly on the manuscript, has left them with an expertise on Conan Doyle which they can hardly have expected. At the other end of the project, Lois Burke at Edinburgh University applied editorial and computer skills that transformed the text of the edition into readable form. I am very grateful to these three young scholars. Thanks too to the staff of Hong Kong University Library, the British Library, the London Library, and particularly to the Mount Holyoke College Library (Archives and Special Collections), especially James Gehrt, Leslie Fields, and Debbie Richards, for so generously making the manuscript available, and for their hospitality. I have benefited greatly from the published work of Conan Doyle scholars and critics; many but not all of these debts are acknowledged in the pages that follow. But in the preparation of this volume, a number of individual scholars have given much-needed help and advice. First among equals is Ian Duncan, who oversaw the whole process and gave invaluable counsel and encouragement. Jon Lellenberg has been unfailingly generous with help for this volume and support for the edition as ix\n\nacknowledgements\n\na whole. I am also very indebted to Jonathan Cranfield, Andrew Glazzard, Roger Luckhurst, James Machin, Richard Pooley, and the doyen of Conan Doyle studies, Owen Dudley Edwards. As a novice in scholarly editing, I was generously and patiently helped by Anthony Mandal and Allan Simmons, and by members of our editorial board. Rob Dale gave invaluable advice on page setting. For various kindnesses I would also like to thank Linda Dryden, Tom Ue, and of course Elaine Ho. The edition most gratefully acknowledges generous support from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Conan Doyle Estate.

There was time for reflection and retrospection. He probably sensed that his best literary work was behind him – he had not published a novel since The Valley of Fear in 1915 – though he continued to write and publish with a Victorian industriousness. His mother, to whom he was devoted, had died at the end of 1920, and the children of his second marriage were growing up and often accompanied their parents on their extensive travels. These indefatigable wanderings, in Europe, Australasia, North America, and South Africa, which occupied so much of the last decade of Conan Doyle’s life, were lecture tours in which he sought to spread the revelations of Spiritualism, which, as he wrote in the last chapter of his autobiography, had come ‘to absorb the whole energy of [his] life’ (M&A, 337). He was known around the world as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, though there were other literary achievements of which he was more proud. In 1923, after the publication of ‘The Adventure of the Creeping Man’ and as he contemplated writing his life story, he seems to have made one of his periodic resolutions to write no more Sherlock Holmes tales.1 He had tried his hand at many different kinds of writing, both fiction and non-fiction, and although nowadays we would class him a genre writer – Darryl Jones calls him ‘the greatest genre writer Britain has ever produced’2 – in his own day there was less concern to draw a firm line between serious literary writing and such genres, usually more popular, as historical or crime fiction, sporting tales or ghost stories. At home Dr Conan Doyle was a well-known public figure, accustomed to giving his opinion in the national press and on speaking platforms on matters as varied as the Congo atrocities, the Olympic Games, and divorce law reform.

He had travelled the world, and reported on three wars. Now he had entered his seventh decade, and he, and his publisher, could have been confident that many of the readers who had taken him to their hearts, as the creator of Sherlock Holmes and Sir Nigel and Professor Challenger, would be interested in the story of his own memories and adventures. This introduction offers an account of the genesis of the book, its composition, publication history, and reception, and its relation to the genre of autobiography, to the times in which his life was lived, and to modern biographical knowledge of Conan Doyle. GENESIS AND COMPOSITION Conan Doyle was far from confessional by temperament, but earlier in his career he had published the unusually personal The Stark Munro Letters (London: Longmans, Green, 1895), an epistolary novel about a young doctor which is largely based on his own early career and intellectual development.3 The delightful Through the Magic Door (London: Smith, Elder, 1907), his book about the pleasures of reading, leaves a vivid impression of his intellectual and emotional life, and he had also published autobiographical work in various magazine articles and in his travel writing. In 1923 the time seemed right to review his career, and the evolution of his beliefs, in a single volume of memoirs. Some already published writing could be incorporated, with some revision, into the new project: this included his journalistic dispatches from the British, Italian, and French lines during the Great War,4 but also the account of his adventures on the whaling ship Hope, which he had first written about in ‘Whaling in the Arctic Ocean’ in the Strand Magazine (vol. 13, 16–25), as long ago as January 1897. But most of the material was new, the product of a sustained exercise of memory across several months. Undoubtedly a part of his motivation was to provide a context, a history, and a justification for the spiritual vocation which had come to dominate his life, and to which he was to devote most of the remarkable energies of his last decade. And so, drawing sometimes on previously published work, ³ Some subsequent Stark Munro material had already been used in ACD’s farcical tale ‘Crabbe’s Practice’, Boy’s Own Paper, Christmas number 1884, 54–7. ⁴ These had already been collected in the volume A Visit to Three Fronts (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1916). xxii\n\nintroduction\n\nbut mostly on his private records and a prodigious and usually accurate memory, he proceeded to write the autobiographical episodes which would be gathered together in Memories and Adventures, published as a book in September 1924. It is not certain exactly when Conan Doyle decided to write an autobiography, or when he began. But when ‘Early Recollections’, ‘Under the Jesuits’, and ‘Recollections of a Student’ appeared in the Strand Magazine in October 1923 (vol. 66, 323–36), they were presented as the first chapters of his Memories and Adventures. More chapters were promised for the next number, and they continued in a steady flow into the middle of the following year. Apart from the narratives of his visits to various fronts in the Great War, and the final chapter, almost all of the book first came before the public in instalments in the pages of the Strand, volumes 66 to 68, between October 1923 and July 1924. The apparent dispersal and disappearance of the relevant archives of the Strand, including authors’ correspondence and proofs, is a major loss to Conan Doyle studies.5 There exists a manuscript of some two-thirds of the book, now held in the library of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, USA. Most of it is in Conan Doyle’s own hand, though some passages are typewritten, and a few chapters incorporate pages of printed material. The indications are that he wrote fluently, in a remarkably legible hand (for a physician), and with relatively few second thoughts. He was a professional author with deadlines to meet, writing amidst a busy schedule of activities, meetings and speaking obligations, and other publishing commitments. There is not much evidence, in his vigorous hand, of indecision about the structure of the narrative, or of agonizing over the mot juste. The holograph suggests that he proceeded confidently and he seems to have had no difficulty supplying the Strand with monthly instalments, often consisting of two or three chapters. He kept up a steady chronological narrative, interrupted now and then with chapters devoted to a special theme, such as Sherlock Holmes, or sport. At the same time he was busy producing a stream of other publications – stories, travel narratives, Spiritualist articles – and making a se⁵ Reginald Pound, the Strand’s penultimate editor, wrote: ‘My impression was that most and in fact nearly all the documentary material relating to the magazine was dispersed at the death of Greenhough Smith in the ’thirties.’ Letter to Richard Lancelyn Green, 15 June 1984 (ACD1/L/66, Arthur Conan Doyle Collection, Richard Lancelyn Green Bequest, Portsmouth History Centre). xxiii\n\nintroduction\n\nries of public appearances, usually to lecture on Spiritualist topics. (One significant activity he undertook while writing Memories and Adventures was an act of filial piety, the mounting of an exhibition of works by his late father, the artist and illustrator Charles Altamont Doyle, at the Brooke Galleries in London, from 31 January to 14 February 1924. The project arose from his reminiscence of his father while writing the book: he mentions his desire to mount such an exhibition in the first edition, and records his satisfaction at having done so in the second.) PUBLICATION HISTORY It was common practice for a writer of Conan Doyle’s generation to publish his or her work first in serial form, usually in a monthly periodical, and then to bring it out as a book, either as a ‘three-decker’ (a format for fiction which was in decline when he was starting out as an author) or as a single volume. Arranging advantageous magazine publication was one of the chief jobs of the literary agent, a profession which came into being in Conan Doyle’s lifetime to help authors navigate the complexities of the literary market. It was a market in which educational reforms, increasing affluence and leisure time for many, and a widespread appetite for self-improvement had created a potential readership of unprecedented size. Conan Doyle’s work appeared in scores of different outlets in his professional lifetime, but his relationship with the Strand Magazine is one of the legends of the great age of periodical publication.6 His story ‘The Voice of Science’ had been sent to the Strand by his agent, A. P. Watt, in January 1891 before the magazine appeared for the first time, and was published in the first volume in March. When he began to send his agent short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes (following the two novellas, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four, in which Holmes had made his debut), Watt again sent them to Herbert Greenhough Smith, who was to remain the Strand’s editor until the year of Conan Doyle’s death, 1930; before long, Conan Doyle worked directly with Greenhough Smith much of the time. The popularity of the Holmes stories enhanced the popularity of the new magazine, and vice versa. Thereafter, the Strand was Conan Doyle’s most favoured publication outlet, and it remained ⁶ See Jonathan Cranfield, Twentieth-Century Victorian: Arthur Conan Doyle and the Strand Magazine, 1891–1930 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 2016). xxiv\n\nintroduction\n\nindelibly associated with the figure of the great detective, right up to the publication of the last Sherlock Holmes tale, ‘The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place’, which appeared in the magazine in April 1927 (vol. 73, 317–27). For a writer of Conan Doyle’s established reputation, it was not difficult for his agent to arrange for the instalments to come out in a magazine in the United States, more or less simultaneously with their publication in London. After the passing of the International Copyright Act of 1891, American magazine and book publication represented a lucrative income stream for the better-known British authors, and Conan Doyle, promoted in the States by the influential S. S. McClure, was already a transatlantic celebrity when he undertook his American lecture tour in 1894. So we see several chapters of the book given parallel publication in New York outlets like Collier’s Weekly Magazine and McClure’s. A few instalments appeared, either simultaneously with the Strand or exclusively, in other London titles like Pearson’s and even the venerable Cornhill Magazine. The London firm of Hodder and Stoughton published the first edition of Memories and Adventures on 18 September 1924, with a print run of 2,000 copies. It included eight photographic illustrations, and cost twenty shillings. A second impression of 1,000 copies followed in October. (By way of comparison, Hodders had printed 10,716 copies of The Lost World in 1912, and John Murray would put out 15,150 copies of The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes in 1927.)7 Coinciding with the London publication, a first American edition came out with the Boston house of Little, Brown. Late in 1929, when his health was failing, Conan Doyle returned to Memories and Adventures with a view to tidying up and updating it, with the encouragement of the publisher John Murray. The revisions he made are discussed later in this volume in the Essay on the Text, the chief ones being the omission of Chapter 25, ‘To the Rocky Mountains in 1914’, and the replacement of the original final chapter, ‘The Psychic Quest’, with a new ending, ‘Up to Date’.8 In the event this second edition, pub⁷ Figures are from A Bibliography of A.

Memories and Adventures is the final, twenty-fourth volume of the Crowborough Edition of the works of Conan Doyle, published in New York by Doubleday, Doran in 1930. The ailing author had been unable to supervise or to supply new prefaces for what had been intended to be a complete and definitive edition of his works of fiction (the autobiography is the one non-fictional anomaly), and the first edition of 1924 is simply reproduced. Conan Doyle’s fiction has been perennially popular, and interest in his life is attested by the list of some thirty full or partial biographical studies. While these are of varying interest, Memories and Adventures is a principal source for all of them, and its use by a handful of these biographers is discussed briefly below. It is the fiction, of course, which continues to enjoy a prodigious afterlife, but before the appearance of this edition, Memories and Adventures was still afloat and available, in print and electronic form. In recent times the text of the 1924 edition has been reprinted by Greenhill Books with a foreword by Richard Lancelyn Green (London: 1988), by Oxford University Press in the Oxford Letters and Memoirs series (Oxford: 1989), as Memories and Adventures: An Autobiography by Wordsworth Editions (Ware: 2007) with an introduction by David Stuart Davies, and again reproduced by Cambridge University Press in the Cambridge Library Collection (Cambridge: 2012). All these are unedited versions. Conan Doyle would, we hope, be gratified to know that the first full scholarly edition of his autobiography is issued by the press of his alma mater, the University of Edinburgh. RECEPTION When he began his autobiography, Conan Doyle was an international celebrity, the creator of two of the best-known fictional characters in the history of world literature. He was not only admired but held in affection by a wide public of men and women, at home and abroad. His work appealed in equal measure to those readers who would soon be christened highbrows, and to a wider public who looked to literature only for amusement, novelty, and distraction. Besides crime fiction, which he revolutionized, he had had popular success in other genres. Some of his historical fiction rivalled Sherlock Holmes in book sales. In particular, his xxvi\n\nintroduction\n\nmastery of the short-story form had coincided happily with a time when there was a huge appetite for short fiction, stoked by the many dozens of popular periodicals that had sprung up to supply an expanded and busy reading public, with a taste for tales of mystery and adventure that did not require an undue investment of time. Like his older contemporary Robert Louis Stevenson, and his younger contemporary Rudyard Kipling, it was not entirely clear whether he was an author for adults or for children: he was certainly enjoyed by both. But unlike the exotically remote Stevenson, or the fiercely private Kipling, Conan Doyle was also a cheerfully available, highly visible public figure, an accepter of invitations and honours, a patron of charities and good causes, a frequent speaker on this or that public platform, an indefatigable writer of letters to the editor. He communicated with his public in a friendly, accessible and unpretentious literary style. Progressive on some issues, culturally conservative on others, patriotic, and upright, he seemed to embody the sort of virtues which the British public suspected itself of possessing. That image of the author was, of course, part of the truth. It had reached its zenith in the early years of the Great War, when Conan Doyle, as he tells us in his autobiography, was enjoying dressing up in military uniform to visit the British troops and their allies, and to report on their courage and resourcefulness at a time of historic crisis. But at the same time there was another side to him, though it was kept largely out of the Sherlock Holmes stories. This was an author who had started to feel at odds with the society which had embraced him as a sort of national icon. His involvement with the case of George Edalji in 1907 undoubtedly shocked him with what it showed of the stupidity, corruption, and racial prejudice of the police and judicial process whose honesty had been so comfortably taken for granted in the background of his detective stories. A larger alienation sprang from his deepening commitment to the cause of Spiritualism, which he espoused publicly in the middle of the war.9 (For Conan Doyle, who had been a war patriot and had often written about the romance of fighting, the conflict ended in bitter disappointment. His estrangement may have been compounded by the feeling, ⁹ ACD, ‘A New Revelation: Spiritualism and Religion’, Light, vol. 36, 4 November 1916, 357–8. He described this new revelation as ‘by far the greatest religious event since the death of Christ’ (357). xxvii\n\nintroduction\n\nshared by many of his generation in the aftermath of the war, that they did not fully belong in the fast-changing post-war world.) In his defence of his beliefs he set his face against the many institutions – the churches, the political class, the scientific professions, the law, the press – which refused, he felt, to give Spiritualism a fair hearing.10 His advocacy of his psychic beliefs and experience was to become increasingly strident. Spiritualism had many adherents in the decade after the Great War. Still, of course, to most people Conan Doyle seemed increasingly wrong-headed, isolated, and hopelessly gullible. This last quality was painfully exposed when the Strand Magazine, with a circulation approaching half a million, loyally published an article in which he announced that actual fairies had been seen, and photographed, by two girls near the village of Cottingley in Yorkshire.11 Widespread derision followed, highly damaging to the reputation he had built up over many decades of pleasing work. This is the context for the reception of his autobiography. Reviewers’ responses to Memories and Adventures tend to be marked by a mixture of admiration of his long career as a storyteller, and exasperation at his recent turn to the spiritual. The Scottish Aberdeen Press and Journal (18 September 1924, 2) was fairly typical in its attitude. Its review begins: ‘Admirers of the historical novels and detective stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who have been unable to accompany him with any degree of satisfaction in his recently published books of psychic adventures, will find an abundance of agreeable, entertaining reading in his latest work, which is no less than his autobiography.’ The reviewer is impressed by what the book shows of the variety of its subject’s life: he has been a doctor, traveller, politician, soldier, lecturer, occultist, and sportsman. ‘And the psychic question, the sceptic, perhaps, will learn with some degree of jubilation, is not obtruded upon the reader.’ The London Times too (23 September 1924, 17) mentions ‘his “psychic” experiences, as to the validity of which he is perfectly confident’, but goes on to praise the book’s enthusiastic war pictures and memories of sport, adding shrewdly: ‘Whatever Sir Arthur has heard or seen at séances, we ¹⁰ These institutions are all attacked in his Spiritualist novel The Land of Mist (London: Hutchinson, 1926). ¹¹ ACD, ‘Fairies Photographed – An Epoch-Making Event’, Strand (Christmas Number), vol. 60, December 1920, 463–8. xxviii\n\nintroduction\n\nare sure he has made “spirit contact” with Peter Pan.’ In the Times Literary Supplement (25 September 1924, 591), David Leslie Murray struck a similar note. ‘Few men can have carried the best of their schooldays with them through a long life with such success,’ Murray wrote, while allowing that ‘perhaps we ought to recognize the same spirit in a less alluring form in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “psychic quest”’. But the TLS too had little to say about the book’s record of its author’s literary life. In more recent times the book has chiefly drawn the attention, perhaps naturally, of writers whose focus has been on Conan Doyle’s life. The doyen of these, Owen Dudley Edwards, calls Memories and Adventures ‘vigorous and engaging’, but far from committed to a full romantic disclosure. He notes that ‘themes of alcoholism, avarice and insanity had made a severe imprint on Conan Doyle’s youthful mind,’ and are frequently present in the fiction, but that he struggled hard and successfully to keep them from his autobiographical work, and to hide the tragedy of his father.12 Martin Booth was also struck by what the book left out, but finds it nonetheless impressive. ‘For all its omissions, the book was honest, a sincere stocktaking in which he criticized some of his own books and admitted some of his mistakes but portrayed his life as a romantic adventure with a strong emphasis on his wartime exploits. His sense of excitement, chivalry and many achievements was strongly in evidence, as was his old sense of humour.’13 A similar approach had been taken by Richard Lancelyn Green in an essay describing the book as Conan Doyle’s ‘final tale of chivalry’. ‘When he describes his life,’ says Green, ‘he omits the inner man.’14 And the editors of a collection of Conan Doyle’s letters feel that the correspondence ‘constitutes a far more candid autobiography’ than the one he actually published as Memories\n\n¹² Owen Dudley Edwards, The Quest for Sherlock Holmes (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984), 18, 32. ¹³ Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1997), 331. ¹⁴ Richard Lancelyn Green, ‘His Final Tale of Chivalry’, in The Quest for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: Thirteen Biographers in Search of a Life, ed. Jon L. Lellenberg (Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1987), 38–63, at 43. ‘His autobiography becomes the sequel to his historical novels,’ writes Green, ‘for here Sir Arthur vanquishes his foes and wins glory for himself. His life becomes a romance.’ (62) xxix\n\nintroduction\n\nand Adventures.15 This may well be so, though we need not judge or enjoy an autobiography only on the basis of the amount it discloses about the personal life of the author. In all, there has been little attention to Memories and Adventures as a piece of writing rather than as a record, and a gappy one, of what had happened to its author. A notable exception is an essay by Diana Barsham, in which she examines the rhetoric of the book, and specifically Conan Doyle’s strategies for evading the tendency of autobiography towards confession and the revealing of interiority.16 The question of genre is not an entirely straightforward one, but autobiography itself is an important part of the context in which Memories and Adventures was produced. CONTEXT: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL TRADITION In relating his Memories and Adventures, Conan Doyle was undertaking a kind of book often favoured by authors and other public figures late in their career. The Victorians inherited the deeply autobiographical impulse of Romantic art itself, and a curiosity about individual lives which is reflected in big institutional projects of the Victorian age like the National Portrait Gallery and the Dictionary of National Biography. Of relevance to Conan Doyle’s venture were not only the reminiscences of authors, such as Anthony Trollope’s An Autobiography of 1883 (notably protective of its author’s private life), but also the memoirs of public figures – soldiers and explorers, statesmen and actors – oriented mostly to a life of action and relatively free of introspection. Conan Doyle’s own life-writing partakes of both this outward-oriented form of reminiscence, and, to a lesser degree, of the reflections of autobiographers whose attention is more given to the inner life and the development of their ideas, feelings, and personality. He can proceed sometimes like the soldier-memoirist Field Marshal Lord Roberts and at other times like\n\n¹⁵ Arthur Conan Doyle: A Life in Letters, ed. John Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, and Charles Foley (London: Harper, 2007), 4. ¹⁶ Diana Barsham, ‘Buried in Laughter: The Memories and Adventures of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’, Mortal Pages, Literary Lives: Studies in Nineteenth-Century Autobiography, ed. Vincent Newey and Philip Shaw (Aldershot: Scolar Press, 1996), 235–52. xxx\n\nintroduction\n\nthe philosopher-autobiographer John Stuart Mill.17 Roberts chronicled his campaigns, while Mill offered the history of his mind. But whereas the narrative of memoirs can proceed on the simple principle of one-damned-thing-after-another, ‘the crucial literary problem of autobiography,’ as Patricia Meyer Spacks writes, ‘is to articulate a significant form for the relative incoherence of human experience.’18 An autobiography (as opposed to a memoir) is more likely to attend carefully to the developing inner life of the subject, and to be informed by some sense of an inner telos or destination, such as the pursuit of romantic authenticity or philosophical or spiritual truth. It is a biological impossibility for an autobiography to tell the complete story of a life, but often the principle that emerges is of a movement, sometimes painful, towards understanding, if only of the self. This is especially true of the autobiographies of artists, which characteristically dwell on the subject’s inner thoughts and feelings. An example of the autobiography of sensibility and introspection awaited Conan Doyle, comically enough, on a tedious journey down the Nile in 1896, where the only reading matter was the Confessions (1782) of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau boasted of the absolute frankness and intimacy of his life story, but Conan Doyle recollects in Memories and Adventures how he recoiled from this romantic self-accounting, which struck him as a self-indulgent and vulgar egotism. It was a form of expression alien to him, as he explained in a tongue-in-cheek discussion of autobiography in Through the Magic Door, seventeen years before writing his own life story: If we don’t know all about Gibbon it is not his fault, for he wrote no fewer than six accounts of his own career, each differing from the other, and all equally bad. A man must have more heart and soul than Gibbon to write a good autobiography. It is the most difficult of all human compositions, calling for a mixture of tact, discretion, ¹⁷ See Frederick Roberts (Lord Roberts of Kandahar), Forty-One Years in India: From Subaltern to Commander-in-Chief (London: Richard Bentley, 1898) and John Stuart Mill, Autobiography, ed. John M. Robson (London: Penguin, 1989). A near-contemporary example of the action-oriented memoir is Winston Churchill’s My Early Life (London: Thornton Butterworth, 1930). ¹⁸ Patricia Meyer Spacks, Imagining a Self: Autobiography and Novel in Eighteenth-Century England (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1976), 434. xxxi\n\nintroduction\n\nand frankness which make an almost impossible blend. Gibbon, in spite of his foreign education, was a very typical Englishman in many ways, with the reticence, self-respect, and self-consciousness of the race. No British autobiography has ever been frank, and consequently no British autobiography has ever been good. Trollope’s perhaps, is as good as any that I know, but of all forms of literature it is the one least adapted to the national genius. You could not imagine a British Rousseau, still less a British Benvenuto Cellini. In one way it is to the credit of the race that it should be so. If we do as much evil as our neighbours we at least have grace enough to be ashamed of it and to suppress its publication.19 The autobiography of self-regard seemed to him unmanly and unBritish, which was to say it was foreign to the ethos which he himself cultivated and embodied.20 He thought the greatest autobiography in English was Samuel Pepys’s Diary,21 and the diary, of course, is the supreme example of the one-damned-thing-after-another structure. Pepys was keeping a chronicle. He was not at all concerned with a telos of romantic self-realization, or even with self-portraiture. If life-writing deals, in the words of Laura Marcus, with ‘the relationship between the inner and the outer world, psyche and polis’,22 Conan Doyle’s autobiography, like most of his fiction, dwells more in the outer world of action than in interiority and reflection. He does not have a great deal to say about his inner thoughts and feelings. Much of the story he has to tell is that of a public man, and this is not what we usually anticipate of the self-portrait of an artist such as an author, where the modern assumption is that we will be shown the real inner self, somehow separate from the outward face offered to the public. It is also a method that goes against the usual expectations of modern autobiography itself (expectations partly derived from the fact that autobiography so closely resembles a familiar kind of novel). ‘Autobiography is so powerfully ¹⁹ ACD, Through the Magic Door, 83–84. 20 See Diana Barsham, Arthur Conan Doyle and the Meaning of Masculinity (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000). ²¹ Through the Magic Door, 83. ACD calls it Pepys’s ‘involuntary autobiography’. ²² Laura Marcus, ‘Autobiography and Psychoanalysis’, On Life-Writing, ed. Zachary Leader (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2015), 257–83, at 268. xxxii\n\nintroduction\n\nyoked in modern formulations to notions of interiority and depth,’ says Adam Smyth, ‘that the concept of a written self, assembled through surfaces and things, seems counter-intuitive or lacking.’23 Conan Doyle mostly eschews the confessional tradition of literary self-portraiture, and this may make him seem old-fashioned (or postmodern), or merely evasive.24 But perhaps what is at stake is a self-conception of the nature of the writer in society, and of his or her relations with the reading public, which we need to make an effort to recover. Few more recent authors share the mixture of confidence and modesty which Conan Doyle brought to the role of writer. There is little here, too, of the modernist distrust of narratives of a unified self, what D. H. Lawrence called ‘the old stable ego’ of the character.25 The mature subject of Conan Doyle’s life emerges as a steady moral self, consistent over time.26 The only significant change in that adult self is his espousal of Spiritualism. But it is this that provides his story with its telos, and at the same time opens a window into the interior life as he experienced it most passionately. Spiritual autobiography goes back to Saint Augustine, but a particular English tradition, which helped to shape the early history of the English novel as well as English autobiography, was the Puritan narrative of error and redemption best exemplified in John Bunyan’s Grace Abounding to\n\n²³ Adam Smyth, ‘Introduction’, A History of English Autobiography, ed.

The teleological arc of spiritual autobiography is also to be found in Memories and Adventures, though Conan Doyle’s conversion is presented as less melodramatic, more a gradual assenting to overwhelming evidence. (This was usually the case for scientifically or practically minded converts to Spiritualism, who were anxious to avoid the impression of charismatic revelation. Oliver Lodge averred that ‘the evidence for the survival of man … has always been cumulative’; Arthur Findlay in his autobiography recounts how he tested the voice medium John Sloan for five years before accepting survival after death as proven.)28 Conan Doyle shows that his own youth was misspent not in cursing and blaspheming like Bunyan’s, but in the arrogant materialism of his generation, the belief that science had answered all the questions raised by religion. Arthur Conan Doyle never ceased to think and act like a scientist, but he became convinced that the evidences of Spiritualism offered no less than scientific proof of the survival of the soul and its ability to communicate with the living after death. And so Memories and Adventures contains a spiritual pilgrim’s progress, telling the story of its author’s conversion, and ends with an account of his tireless ministry, spreading the word of the new revelation as assiduously as that earlier convert, the Apostle Paul.29\n\n²⁷ ‘In effect, English autobiography never entirely escapes its religious roots.’ Richard Hughes Gibson and Timothy Larsen, ‘Nineteenth-Century Spiritual Autobiography: Carlyle, Newman, Mill’, in A History of English Autobiography, ed.

Arthur Conan Doyle was born a couple of years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857–8 (the ‘Indian Mutiny’), the great nineteenth-century crisis of the British Empire. When he died in 1930, that empire was wider than ever in extent, still guaranteed by the most famous navy on the seas, and administered from one of the largest and most prosperous cities on earth. In his lifetime, Britain had prevailed in a number of colonial wars in Asia and Africa, including the conflicts in the Sudan and South Africa which he witnessed, and, at terrible cost, in the struggle with its chief industrial rival among the European ‘great powers’ in the Great War of 1914–18. That war saw a number of imperial competitors (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian) removed from the board. But in its aftermath began a long economic decline, the emergence in the world of new industrial, military, and ideological forces, and the growth of dissent and resistance among colonized peoples, that would combine to bring the age of the British Empire to an end. Conan Doyle in the 1920s hoped for a future imperial confederation of equals comprising Britain and its white (or ‘settler’) dominions and, perhaps, the United States, but he probably did not foresee the disappearance within a few decades of the Empire itself. For the most part he wrote as a confident citizen of an imperial nation and a global super-power. His writing shows his fascination with the history from which this pre-eminence had evolved, his admiration of the men who ran it and protected it, and his awareness of the challenges in its path. Britain had become the first modern nation by virtue of its head start in industrialization and urbanization. A combination of an evolving parliamentary democracy, a constitutional monarchy, and some good luck enabled it to avoid the revolutionary upheavals that convulsed all its European neighbours in the nineteenth century. Through the latter part of that century and into the twentieth, a series of liberal reforms changed the face of the nation. Economic power had shifted decisively from the land to the cities, from a now largely decorative aristocracy to a busy bourgeoisie. With a broadening franchise, which at the time of Memories and Adventures had begun to include women, and a programme of reforms extending compulsory universal education, political and cultural power was xxxv\n\nintroduction\n\nshifting too. Conan Doyle himself belonged to, and often wrote about, an emerging and increasingly respected professional class of lawyers and doctors and civil servants and the like, a class which you could join by way of public examinations and qualifications and not through parentage or patronage.30 But though the Labour Party, created to represent the interests of the workers, formed its first government in the year Memories and Adventures was published (1924), class divisions – upper, middle, and lower – remained strong, sustained by noblesse oblige and a sense of entitlement at the top of the pyramid and, usually, by deference at the bottom. In Victoria’s reign Britain was the most affluent nation on earth, though a young doctor in general practice could see the glaring inequalities, the poor housing and wretched public health, which these riches failed to mask. There were also regional differences – the industrial midlands, the agrarian west, the metropolitan south-east. A Scot of Irish ancestry and Catholic education, settled in England, Conan Doyle was fascinated by the Celtic and Anglo-Saxon ingredients of the nation. His work is also attuned to differences of manners between those who lived, as he had done at various times, in the provinces, the suburbs, and the capital. A number of themes recur in the political discourse of Conan Doyle’s time. The Liberal Party split over the Irish Question – should Ireland continue under British government, or be granted Home Rule or even independence? – and the Conservative Party split over economic policy – should trade be free across the world, or should preference and protection be extended to the colonies and dominions? These issues were themselves branches of a yet larger, historical question, about empire. What was the empire and what was it for, what were its justifications and benefits and costs, how should it be run, should it expand (‘wider still and wider’), or should British overseas possessions perhaps be given back to the people who lived in them? Some of these questions came to a head at the time of the South African War, enthusiastically supported by conservatives (deplored as ‘Jingoes’) and glumly deprecated by liberals (aspersed as ‘Little Englanders’), a disagreement that divided Conan Doyle’s own family. He himself spoke out vigorously against the cruelty ³⁰ See Harold Perkin, The Rise of Professional Society: England since 1880 (London: Routledge, 1990). xxxvi\n\nintroduction\n\nand greed of the Belgians in the Congo, but by and large he felt that the British Empire was more humane, and more efficient, than others’. On another controversial topic, the status of women, his views tended to be chivalrous, paternalistic, and patriarchal.31 Women are honoured in his writing, and sometimes portrayed as spirited, but it is very much a man’s world, as Memories and Adventures shows. As for economic life, his strongest critique of the society he lived in takes the form of a Carlylean or Ruskinian attack on materialism, particularly in the years after the Great War when he felt increasingly at odds with the way most people lived. Materialism was the word for a nonbelief in the spirit, but also had the familiar sense of an attachment to worldly things. Capitalism, he felt, is bound to make people more and more acquisitive and competitive, obsessed with money and possessions. At a time when religion had been badly weakened by science, this left people spiritually impoverished and hollow. His Spiritualism was, in this sense, his critique of the waste land of modernity. Spiritualism was the opposite of materialism. In Conan Doyle’s lifetime, both science and literature became professions in the modern sense. Science was entrenching itself in the world of universities and large laboratories and public funding: apparently freelance mavericks like Professor Challenger, and his contemporary the Professor Higgins of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion (1913), were already anachronisms. With his medical degree, Conan Doyle supported himself for a number of years as a physician in general practice, though his ambition to enter the more lucrative world of specialist consultancy came to nothing.32 It was probably only ever a half-hearted ambition, for he was already earning money from his pen. For novelists and dramatists it was possible to make a living, even a good one, from literature, but it was advisable to keep an eye on the market and its appetites. While some of the more serious or more experimental authors (Henry James an older contemporary, Virginia Woolf a younger one) shrank from popular ³¹ He seems uncomfortable in his attempt to write about the fashionable theme of the New Woman, in the novelette Beyond the City, published in the special Christmas number of Good Words for 1891, and then in book form in The Great Shadow and Beyond the City (London: Arrowsmith, 1893). But women are shown as more than capable of holding their own in the medical profession, in the face of male prejudice, in ‘The Doctors of Hoyland’, in Round the Red Lamp (London: Methuen, 1894). ³² See Douglas Kerr, Conan Doyle: Writing, Profession, and Practice (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013), 41–78. xxxvii\n\nintroduction\n\ntastes, or couldn’t connect with them, thus opening a divide between highbrow and ‘genre’ writing, Conan Doyle seems not to have thought in these terms at all, and was happy to provide his readers a steady stream of strong narrative in plain prose. He had little in common with the ‘art for art’s sake’ Aesthetic movement of the 1880s and 1890s, though he liked and admired its high priest, Oscar Wilde. After the scandal (1895) which saw the homosexual Wilde imprisoned and anathematized, many people preferred, or found it prudent, to look in art for qualities of unambiguous masculinity, simplicity, and good health, and no doubt Conan Doyle benefited from this shift in taste. Literature could be a respectable, even honoured profession, as his friends like Sir Walter Besant and Sir James Barrie could testify. Conan Doyle’s own knighthood, however, was awarded for services to the state as an apologist for the British cause in the Boer War. CONTEXT: BIOGRAPHICAL Memories and Adventures covers all of Conan Doyle’s life up to the time of writing: the second edition updates the story to the collapse in health which preceded his death. It deals with his family and education, his medical and literary careers, his travels and enthusiasms, his very wide acquaintance, his political life and his activism in many causes, and the Spiritualist mission that came to dominate his later years. It says something of his intellectual life, and the evolution of his ideas, but not so much about his emotional adventures, and it keeps the reader at some distance from the more intimate story of his relations with his two wives and his children.33 It does not appear to contain any falsehoods, though it is sometimes unreliable as to dates.34 But there are some significant omissions, of sensitive material which he considered none of the reader’s business. He makes no mention of the dipsomania of his father, Charles Altamont Doyle, which rendered him unable to work, was the cause of dis³³ His second family appears, however, in a series of whimsical sketches of family life published in the Strand and later as Three of Them (London: John Murray, 1923). ³⁴ The dates in Memories and Adventures can be checked against those given in Brian W. Pugh, A Chronology of the Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 4th edition (London: MX Publishing, 2018). xxxviii\n\nintroduction\n\ntressing domestic incidents, and led to his being institutionalized for the later years of his life (he died in 1892 in the Crichton Royal Institution at Dumfries). The stigma of Charles’s alcoholism, and perhaps guilt at the family’s consigning him to institutional care for many years, no doubt kept this story out of the pages of Memories and Adventures, though the son is loyally enthusiastic about the father’s skill as an artist. Next, the book is eloquently silent about the figure of Bryan Charles Waller, a young physician who entered the family’s life as their lodger in Edinburgh in 1876, encouraged the young Arthur in his medical studies, and seems to have provided emotional and financial support to the family over the years. The nature of Waller’s relationship with the Doyles is a crux of Conan Doyle’s biography. In 1883, in her forties and four years after her husband was first institutionalized, Mary Doyle left Edinburgh and moved with her younger children to a cottage near Waller’s home on his Masongill estate in Yorkshire, where they were to live rent-free. She remained at Masongill until 1917. Whatever the precise nature of her friendship with Waller (who married in 1896), it was clearly unusually close, and potentially scandalous. Waller is not mentioned in her son’s autobiography.351 The third significant omission from the story concerns Conan Doyle’s wives. His first wife Louise (Touie) was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis in 1893, and was expected to live only a few months. In fact, as Conan Doyle relates, she survived until 1906. In 1897, he met the twenty-three-year-old Jean Leckie and fell in love with her. Though they probably had no sexual relations while Touie was alive, Arthur spent much time with her, and introduced her to his friends and family (including his invalid wife). Their obvious romantic attachment was the cause of sharp friction with some family members. They married in 1907, ten years after their first meeting and a year after the death of her unfortunate predecessor, and this is the first time Jean is mentioned in Memories and Adventures. With these omissions, a mischievous sentence from Through the Magic Door comes home to roost, to the effect that ‘when the British author tells his own story he tries to make himself respectable, and the more ³⁵ Owen Dudley Edwards observes that, with his Spiritualist beliefs, ACD ‘would hold her [his deceased mother] to be aware of what he was writing’. The Quest for Sherlock Holmes, 53. xxxix\n\nintroduction\n\nrespectable a man is the less interesting does he become’.³⁶2 But if Conan Doyle had had it in him to be more frank about these matters, he would have been a different author and a different man. What we have in Memories and Adventures is a literary life story that reminds us – and not just on the grounds of autobiographical reticence – of the difference of the past. What it does contain is a remarkable panorama of the busy life of Britain’s last national writer, a man of letters with an idea of the writer’s role very remote from today’s – as seen, for example, in the amount of space devoted in this book to public, military, and of course spiritual matters. Besides being one of the most important authors of his generation, Conan Doyle was also engaged with the full life of the nation which, in more than one sense, he represented. If his story avoids an intimacy which he would have found embarrassing, its fluent and friendly prose shows him familiar with and close to a readership which had known him for years in the pages of the Strand Magazine before the instalments of his autobiography began to appear there. And his readers today can explore here the range of Conan Doyle’s sense of himself, as a man of letters, a family man, a citizen, a spiritual pilgrim, and a man of his time.\n\n³⁶ ACD, Through the Magic Door, 84. xl\n\nMemories and Adventures by\n\nARTHUR CONAN DOYLE\n\nPREFACE I have had a life which, for variety and romance, could, I think, hardly be exceeded. I have known what it was to be a poor man and I have known what it was to be fairly affluent. I have sampled every kind of human experience. I have known many of the most remarkable men of my time. I have had a long literary career after a medical training which gave me the M.D. of Edinburgh. I have tried my hand at very many sports, including boxing, cricket, billiards, motoring, football, aeronautics and ski-ing, having been the first to introduce the latter for long journeys into Switzerland. I have travelled as Doctor to a whaler for seven months in the Arctic and afterwards in the West Coast of Africa. I have seen something of three wars, the Soudanese, the South African and the German. My life has been dotted with adventures of all kinds. Finally I have been constrained to devote my latter years to telling the world the final result of thirty-six years’ study of the occult, and in endeavouring to make it realize the overwhelming importance of the question. In this mission I have already travelled more than 50,000 miles and addressed 300,000 people, besides writing seven books upon the subject. Such is the life which I have told in some detail in my Memories and Adventures. ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE. Crowborough, June, 1924.\n\n1\n\nChapter 1 EARLY RECOLLECTIONS 5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nExtraction – ‘H. B.’ – Four Remarkable Brothers – My Mother’s Family Tree – An Unrecognized Genius – My First Knockout – Thackeray – The Fenians – Early Reading – My First Story. I was born on May 22, 1859, at Picardy Place, Edinburgh, so named because in old days a colony of French Huguenots had settled there. At the time of their coming it was a village outside the City walls, but now it is at the end of Queen Street, abutting upon Leith Walk. When last I visited it, it seemed to have degenerated, but at that time the flats were of good repute. My father was the youngest son of John Doyle, who under the nom de crayon of ‘H. B.’ made a great reputation in London from about 1825 to 1850. He came from Dublin about the year 1815 and may be said to be the father of polite caricature, for in the old days satire took the brutal shape of making the object grotesque in features and figure. Gillray and Rowlandson had no other idea. My grandfather was a gentleman, drawing gentlemen for gentlemen, and the satire lay in the wit of the picture and not in the mis-drawing of faces. This was a new idea, but it has been followed by most caricaturists since and so has become familiar. There were no comic papers in those days, and the weekly cartoon of ‘H. B.’ was lithographed and distributed. He exerted, I am told, quite an influence upon politics, and was on terms of intimacy with many of the leading men of his day. I can remember him in his old age, a very handsome and dignified man with features of the strong Anglo-Irish, Duke of Wellington stamp. He died in 1868. My grandfather was left a widower with a numerous family, of which four boys and one girl survived. Each of the boys made a name for himself, for all inherited the artistic powers of their father. The elder, James Doyle, wrote The Chronicles of England, illustrated with coloured pictures by himself – examples of colour-printing which beat any subsequent work that I have ever seen. He also spent thirteen years in doing The Official Baronage of England, a wonderful monument of industry and learning. Another brother was Henry Doyle, a great judge of old paintings, and in later years the manager of the National Gallery in Dublin, where 2\n\nchapter 1\n\nhe earned his C.B. The third son was Richard Doyle, whose whimsical humour made him famous in Punch, the cover of which with its dancing elves is still so familiar an object. Finally came Charles Doyle, my father. The Doyle family seem to have been fairly well-to-do, thanks to my grandfather’s talents. They lived in London in Cambridge Terrace. A sketch of their family life is given in Dicky Doyle’s Diary. They lived up to their income, however, and it became necessary to find places for the boys. When my father was only nineteen a seat was offered him in the Government Office of Works in Edinburgh, whither he went. There he spent his working life, and thus it came about that I, an Irishman by extraction, was born in the Scottish capital. The Doyles, Anglo-Norman in origin, were strong Roman Catholics. The original Doyle, or D’Oil, was a cadet-branch of the Staffordshire Doyles, which has produced Sir Francis Hastings Doyle and many other distinguished men. This cadet shared in the invasion of Ireland and was granted estates in County Wexford, where a great clan rose of dependents, illegitimate children and others, all taking the feudal lord’s name, just as the de Burghs founded the clan of Burke. We can only claim to be the main stem by virtue of community of character and appearance with the English Doyles and the unbroken use of the same crest and coat-ofarms. My forbears, like most old Irish families in the south, kept to the old faith at the Reformation and fell victims to the penal laws in consequence. These became so crushing upon landed gentry that my great-grandfather was driven from his estate and became a silk-mercer in Dublin, where ‘H. B.’ was born. This family record was curiously confirmed by Monsignor Barry Doyle, destined, I think, for the highest honours of the Roman Church, who traces back to the younger brother of my great-grandfather. I trust the reader will indulge me in my excursion into these family matters, which are of vital interest to the family, but must be tedious to the outsider. As I am on the subject, I wish to say a word upon my mother’s family, the more so as she was great on archæology, and had, with the help of Sir Arthur Vicars, Ulster King of Arms, and himself a relative, worked out her descent for more than five hundred years, and so composed a family tree which lies before me as I write and on which many of the great ones of the earth have roosted. Her father was a young doctor of Trinity College, William Foley, who died young and left his family in comparative poverty. He had married 3\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nearly recollections\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\none Katherine Pack, whose death-bed – or rather the white waxen thing which lay upon that bed – is the very earliest recollection of my life. Her near relative – uncle, I think – was Sir Denis Pack, who led the Scottish brigade at Waterloo. The Packs were a fighting family, as was but right as they were descended in a straight line from a major in Cromwell’s army who settled in Ireland. One of them, Anthony Pack, had part of his head carried off at the same battle, so I fear it is part of our family tradition that we lose our heads in action. His brain was covered over by a silver plate and he lived for many years, subject only to very bad fits of temper, which some of us have had with less excuse. But the real romance of the family lies in the fact that about the middle of the seventeenth century the Reverend Richard Pack, who was head of Kilkenny College, married Mary Percy, who was heir to the Irish branch of the Percys of Northumberland. By this alliance we all connect up (and I have every generation by name, as marked out by my dear mother) with that illustrious line up to three separate marriages with the Plantagenets. One has, therefore, some strange strains in one’s blood which are noble in origin and, one can but hope, are noble in tendency. But all this romance of ancestry did not interfere with the fact that when Katherine Pack, the Irish gentlewoman, came in her widowhood to Edinburgh, she was very poor. I have never been clear why it was Edinburgh for which she made. Having taken a flat she let it be known that a paying-guest would be welcome. Just at this time, 1850 or thereabouts, Charles Doyle was sent from London with a recommendation to the priests that they should guard his young morals and budding faith. How could they do this better than by finding him quarters with a wellborn and orthodox widow? Thus it came about that two separate lines of Irish wanderers came together under one roof. I have a little bundle of my father’s letters written in those days, full of appreciation of the kindness which he met with and full, also, of interesting observations on that Scottish society, rough, hard-drinking and kindly, into which he had been precipitated at a dangerously early age, especially for one with his artistic temperament. He had some fine religious instincts, but his environment was a difficult one. In the household was a bright-eyed, very intelligent younger daughter, Mary, who presently went off to France and returned as a very cultivated young woman. The romance is easily understood, and so Charles Doyle in the year 1855 married Mary Foley, my mother, the young couple still residing with my grandmother. 4\n\nchapter 1\n\nTheir means were limited, for his salary as a Civil Servant was not more than about £240. This he supplemented by his drawings. Thus matters remained for practically all his life, for he was quite unambitious and no great promotion ever came his way. His painting was done spasmodically and the family did not always reap the benefit, for Edinburgh is full of water-colours which he had given away. It was one of my unfulfilled schemes to collect as many as possible and to have a Charles Doyle exhibition in London, and this has now been done. The critics were surprised to find what a great and original artist he was – far the greatest, in my opinion, of the family. Bernard Shaw, I remember, expressed the opinion that the pictures should have a room to themselves in a national collection. His brush was concerned not only with fairies and delicate themes of the kind, but with wild and fearsome subjects, so that his work had a very peculiar style of its own, mitigated by great natural humour. He was more terrible than Blake and less morbid than Wiertz. His originality is best shown by the fact that one hardly knows with whom to compare him. In prosaic Scotland, however, he excited wonder rather than admiration, and he was only known in the larger world of London by pen and ink book-illustrations which were not his best mode of expression. The prosaic outcome was that including all his earnings my mother could never have averaged more than £300 a year on which to educate a large family. We lived in the hardy and bracing atmosphere of poverty and we each in turn did our best to help those who were younger than ourselves. My noble sister Annette, who died just as the sunshine of better days came into our lives, went out at a very early age as a governess to Portugal and sent all her salary home. My younger sisters, Lottie and Connie, both did the same thing; and I helped as I could. But it was still my dear mother who bore the long, sordid strain. Often I said to her, ‘When you are old, Mammie, you shall have a velvet dress and gold glasses and sit in comfort by the fire.’ Thank God, it so came to pass. My father, I fear, was of little help to her, for his thoughts were always in the clouds and he had no appreciation of the realities of life. The world, not the family, gets the fruits of genius. Of my boyhood I need say little, save that it was Spartan at home and more Spartan at the Edinburgh school where a tawse-brandishing schoolmaster of the old type made our young lives miserable. From the age of seven to nine I suffered under this pock-marked, one-eyed rascal who might have stepped from the pages of Dickens. In the evenings, 5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nearly recollections\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nhome and books were my sole consolation, save for week-end holidays. My comrades were rough boys and I became a rough boy, too. If there is any truth in the idea of reincarnation – a point on which my mind is still open – I think some earlier experience of mine must have been as a stark fighter, for it came out strongly in youth, when I rejoiced in battle. We lived for some time in a cul de sac street with a very vivid life of its own and a fierce feud between the small boys who dwelt on either side of it. Finally it was fought out between two champions, I representing the poorer boys who lived in flats and my opponent the richer boys who lived in the opposite villas. We fought in the garden of one of the said villas and had an excellent contest of many rounds, not being strong enough to weaken each other. When I got home after the battle, my mother cried, ‘Oh, Arthur, what a dreadful eye you have got!’ To which I replied, ‘You just go across and look at Eddie Tulloch’s eye!’ I met a well-deserved setback on one occasion when I stood forward to fight a bootmaker’s boy, who had come into our preserve upon an errand. He had a green baize bag in his hand which contained a heavy boot, and this he swung against my skull with a force which knocked me pretty well senseless. It was a useful lesson. I will say for myself, however, that though I was pugnacious I was never so to those weaker than myself and that some of my escapades were in the defence of such. As I will show in my chapter on Sport, I carried on my tastes into a later period of my life. One or two little pictures stand out which may be worth recording. When my grandfather’s grand London friends passed through Edinburgh they used, to our occasional embarrassment, to call at the little flat ‘to see how Charles is getting on.’ In my earliest childhood such a one came, tall, white-haired and affable. I was so young that it seems like a faint dream, and yet it pleases me to think that I have sat on Thackeray’s knee. He greatly admired my dear little mother with her grey Irish eyes and her vivacious Celtic ways – indeed, no one met her without being captivated by her. Once, too, I got a glimpse of history. It was in 1866, if my dates are right, that some well-to-do Irish relatives asked us over for a few weeks, and we passed that time in a great house in King’s County. I spent much of it with the horses and dogs, and became friendly with the young groom. The stables opened on to a country road by an arched gate with a loft over it. One morning, being in the yard, I saw the young groom rush into the yard with every sign of fear and hastily shut and bar the doors. 6\n\nChapter 1\n\nHe then climbed into the loft, beckoning to me to come with him. From the loft window we saw a gang of rough men, twenty or so, slouching along the road. When they came opposite to the gate they stopped and looking up shook their fists and cursed at us. The groom answered back most volubly. Afterwards I understood that these men were a party of Fenians, and that I had had a glimpse of one of the periodical troubles which poor old Ireland has endured. Perhaps now, at last, they may be drawing to an end. During these first ten years I was a rapid reader, so rapid that some small library with which we dealt gave my mother notice that books would not be changed more than twice a day. My tastes were boylike enough, for Mayne Reid was my favourite author, and his Scalp Hunters my favourite book. I wrote a little book and illustrated it myself in early days. There was a man in it and there was a tiger, who amalgamated shortly after they met. I remarked to my mother with precocious wisdom that it was easy to get people into scrapes, but not so easy to get them out again, which is surely the experience of every writer of adventures.\n\n7\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nChapter 2 UNDER THE JESUITS 5\n\nThe Preparatory School – The Mistakes of Education – Spartan Schooling – Corporal Punishment – Well-known School Fellows – Gloomy Forecasts – Poetry – London Matriculation – German School – A Happy Year – The Jesuits – Strange Arrival in Paris.\n\n10\n\nI was in my tenth year when I was sent to Hodder, which is the preparatory school for Stonyhurst, the big Roman Catholic public school in Lancashire. It was a long journey for a little boy who had never been away from home before, and I felt very lonesome and wept bitterly upon the way, but in due time I arrived safely at Preston, which was then the nearest station, and with many other small boys and our black-robed Jesuit guardians we drove some twelve miles to the school. Hodder is about a mile from Stonyhurst, and as all the boys there are youngsters under twelve, it forms a very useful institution, breaking a lad into school ways before he mixes with the big fellows. I had two years at Hodder. The year was not broken up by the frequent holidays which illuminate the present educational period. Save for six weeks each summer, one never left the school. On the whole, those first two years were happy years. I could hold my own both in brain and in strength with my comrades. I was fortunate enough to get under the care of a kindly principal, one Father Cassidy, who was more human than Jesuits usually are. I have always kept a warm remembrance of this man and of his gentle ways to the little boys – young rascals many of us – who were committed to his care. I remember the Franco-German War breaking out at this period, and how it made a ripple even in our secluded backwater. From Hodder I passed on to Stonyhurst, that grand mediæval dwelling-house which was left some hundred and fifty years ago to the Jesuits, who brought over their whole teaching staff from some college in Holland in order to carry it on as a public school. The general curriculum, like the building, was mediæval but sound. I understand it has been modernized since. There were seven classes – elements, figures, rudiments, grammar, syntax, poetry and rhetoric – and you were allotted a year for each, or seven in all – a course with which I faithfully complied,\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n8\n\nchapter 2\n\ntwo having already been completed at Hodder. It was the usual public school routine of Euclid, algebra and the classics, taught in the usual way, which is calculated to leave a lasting abhorrence of these subjects. To give boys a little slab of Virgil or Homer with no general idea as to what it is all about or what the classical age was like, is surely an absurd way of treating the subject. I am sure that an intelligent boy could learn more by reading a good translation of Homer for a week than by a year’s study of the original as it is usually carried out. It was no worse at Stonyhurst than at any other school, and it can only be excused on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental dumb-bell by which one can improve one’s mind. It is, I think, a thoroughly false theory. I can say with truth that my Latin and Greek, which cost me so many weary hours, have been little use to me in life, and that my mathematics have been no use at all. On the other hand, some things which I picked up almost by accident, the art of reading aloud, learned when my mother was knitting, or the reading of French books, learned by spelling out the captions of the Jules Verne illustrations, have been of the greatest possible service. My classical education left me with a horror of the classics, and I was astonished to find how fascinating they were when I read them in a reasonable manner in later years. Year by year, then, I see myself climbing those seven weary steps and passing through as many stages of my boyhood. I do not know if the Jesuit system of education is good or not; I would need to have tried another system as well before I could answer that. On the whole it was justified by results, for I think it turned out as decent a set of young fellows as any other school would do. In spite of a large infusion of foreigners and some disaffected Irish, we were a patriotic crowd, and our little pulse beat time with the heart of the nation. I am told that the average of V.C.’ s and D.S.O.’s now held by old Stonyhurst boys is very high as compared with other schools. The Jesuit teachers have no trust in human nature, and perhaps they are justified. We were never allowed for an instant to be alone with each other, and I think that the immorality which is rife in public schools was at a minimum in consequence. In our games and our walks the priests always took part, and a master perambulated the dormitories at night. Such a system may weaken self-respect and self-help, but it at least minimizes temptation and scandal. The life was Spartan, and yet we had all that was needed. Dry bread and hot well-watered milk was our frugal breakfast. There was a ‘joint’ 9\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nunder the jesuits\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nand twice a week a pudding for dinner. Then there was an odd snack called ‘bread and beer’ in the afternoon, a bit of dry bread and the most extraordinary drink, which was brown but had no other characteristic of beer. Finally, there was hot milk again, bread, butter, and often potatoes for supper. We were all very healthy on this régime, with fish, on Fridays. Everything in every way was plain to the verge of austerity, save that we dwelt in a beautiful building, dined in a marble-floored hall with minstrels’ gallery, prayed in a lovely church, and generally lived in very choice surroundings so far as vision and not comfort was concerned. Corporal punishment was severe, and I can speak with feeling as I think few, if any, boys of my time endured more of it. It was of a peculiar nature, imported also, I fancy, from Holland. The instrument was a piece of india-rubber of the size and shape of a thick boot sole. This was called a ‘Tolley’ – why, no one has explained, unless it is a Latin pun on what we had to bear. One blow of this instrument, delivered with intent, would cause the palm of the hand to swell up and change colour. When I say that the usual punishment of the larger boys was nine on each hand, and that nine on one hand was the absolute minimum, it will be understood that it was a severe ordeal, and that the sufferer could not, as a rule, turn the handle of the door to get out of the room in which he had suffered. To take twice nine upon a cold day was about the extremity of human endurance. I think, however, that it was good for us in the end, for it was a point of honour with many of us not to show that we were hurt, and that is one of the best trainings for a hard life. If I was more beaten than others it was not that I was in any way vicious, but it was that I had a nature which responded eagerly to affectionate kindness (which I never received), but which rebelled against threats and took a perverted pride in showing that it would not be cowed by violence. I went out of my way to do really mischievous and outrageous things simply to show that my spirit was unbroken. An appeal to my better nature and not to my fears would have found an answer at once. I deserved all I got for what I did, but I did it because I was mishandled. I do not remember anyone who attained particular distinction among my school-fellows, save Bernard Partridge of Punch, whom I recollect as a very quiet, gentle boy. Father Thurston, who was destined to be one of my opponents in psychic matters so many years later, was in the class above me. There was a young novice, too, with whom I hardly came in contact, but whose handsome and spiritual appearance I well re10\n\nchapter 2\n\nmember. He was Bernard Vaughan, afterwards the famous preacher. Save for one school-fellow, James Ryan – a remarkable boy who grew into a remarkable man – I carried away no lasting friendship from Stonyhurst. It was only in the latest stage of my Stonyhurst development that I realized that I had some literary streak in me which was not common to all. It came to me as quite a surprise, and even more perhaps to my masters, who had taken a rather hopeless view of my future prospects. One master, when I told him that I thought of being a civil engineer, remarked, ‘Well, Doyle, you may be an engineer, but I don’t think you will ever be a civil one.’ Another assured me that I would never do any good in the world, and perhaps from his point of view his prophecy has been justified. The particular incident, however, which brought my latent powers to the surface depended upon the fact that in the second highest class, which I reached in 1874, it was incumbent to write poetry (so called) on any theme given. This was done as a dreary unnatural task by most boys. Very comical their wooings of the muses used to be. For me, saturated as I really was with affection for verse, it was a labour of love, and I produced verses which were poor enough in themselves but seemed miracles to those who had no urge in that direction. The particular theme was the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites and my effort from –\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n‘Like pallid daisies in a grassy wood, So round the sward the tents of Israel stood’; 25\n\nthrough – ‘There was "
