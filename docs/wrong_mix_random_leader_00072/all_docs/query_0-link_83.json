        "text": "and the Roman Table\n\nThe One Vibration\n\nThe One Vibration is the pioneer, shaman, and magician who introduces a new phase or approach to the status quo extant. One implies an independent, initiating free spirit, capable of great accomplishments. Usually known for will power and potential for binary solutions, one can be ambitious, original, and outside the confines of the culture that is based on past systems, especially those that are breaking down. Adaptable in dangerous situations that require shape shifting skill. Socially, the tendency is to be loyal in friendship, dedicated to partner, children, home, and country. One dreams of the heights still beyond the backdrop of known paradigms, an instigator and promoter of new plans and enterprises hitherto unconceived.\n\nThe style is marked by poise, self-determination, with a somewhat forceful bearing or presence.\n\nInsight about 1 Vibration leadership could be gained by watching some of the films that highlight inspired authority figures generated by the fiery 1 Soul Power theme. It is not a coincidence an alignment exists between Russell Crowe 1 Soul Urge and the 1 Name Vibration of Marcus Aurelius. The spectacular gladiatorial film Spartacus also has a 1 Name Vibration along with the star, Kirk Douglas. The 1 Name Vibration of Charlton Heston matches the classic charioteer Judah Ben Hur, a character betrayed and enslaved, yet he overcame his plight and won his laurels in the epic Ben Hur.\n\nThe Six Vibration\n\nGladiator has a 6 Name Vibration, the same 6 Frequency as the Soul Urge-Talents of the name General Aelius Maximus. The Last Days of Pompeii, book and movies set at the time Vesuvius erupted, has the 6 Vibration Soul Urge-Talents as well. The 6 Vibe provides insight into the parable of the Worker in the Vineyard because of the range it embraces. The 6 Frequency refers to the vessel that incases the light, and the karma associated with that container represented by heredity, gender, race, nationality, ergonomics, social standing and so on. The Jupiterian Test proposes the challenge we see past the illusions associated with the vessel and look directly into the power of the light being inside. Originally, the 6 Frequency represented servants, workers, employees, and slaves that included gladiators. Although Jupiter rules professional sports, gladiators who fought and died in the arena do not come under the heading of competitive sports.\n\nRichard Harris who portrayed Marcus Aurelius in, Gladiator, has an interesting relationship with the admired historical figure who was one of the five good emperors of Rome. The first name Richard adds up to 7, the vibration of Soul Urge-Talents of Marcus Aurelius. The sum of the last name Harris is 37, reduced to 10 or the 1 Frequency, the same Name Vibration of Marcus Aurelius. Ridley Scott mentioned he felt half his work as a director was done if he could cast the film with success. His spot on intuition surely paid off with Gladiator. Check Russell Crowe for more about Gladiator and the 1 Vibration."
