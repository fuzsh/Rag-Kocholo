        "text": "Jan 93 #1 Scuttlebutt from the Spermaceti Press T<strong>here</strong> have been many truly unusual Sherlockian productions in the performing arts, including a presentation of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" in dance, mime, and music by the National Tap Dance Company of Canada in 1987. It is perhaps only appropriate that the same story, adapted into Cantonese, was presented by the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts at the Academy Studio Theatre in Hong Kong in December, when by pleasant coincidence Mike and Mary Ann Whelan were in Hong Kong and attended one of the seven performances of the play. Mike reports that they were able to follow most of the plot, and that in this production the Hound was actually seen on stage, and performed well. Pierre Culliford died on Dec. 24. He was a Belgian cartoonist who used the pen name \"Peyo\" and was best known as the inventor of the Smurfs, the small blue creatures who have starred in more than 250 animations and who at one time were getting better Nielsen ratings on Saturday mornings than \"Dallas\" did in prime time. The animations are produced by Hanna-Barbera, and in an 11-minute segment titled \"The Village Vandal\" you will find Brainy Smurf in appropriate costume as Sherlock Smurf. Our new \"Happy New Year!\" stamp honors the oriental year of the rooster (that's the lunar year 4691), and it is unfortunately true that the Canon contains no mention of a rooster. But perhaps we can stretch things a bit to include: \"'It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory,' Holmes answered, with a bitter smile.\" (Norw) It appears that no one has attempted to find Ray Hendrickson's translation of the Musgrave Ritual into Greek in the Sept. 1966 issue of the BSJ (Apr 92 #8). Well, at least no one has pointed out that it isn't to be found in that issue. But it *will* be found on p. 183 of the July 1958 issue. Sorry about that: Sterling Holloway did die on Nov. 22 (Dec 92 #2), and he did indeed play all those fine roles in all those fine Disney films, but he was not easily recognizable as the 1st Gravedigger in \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" (1970). That actor, as Jon Lellenberg has observed, was Stanley Holloway. Recommended by Vivian Heisler: VALLEY OF FEAR, read by Christopher Lee on a two-audiocassette set from Listen for Pleasure. \"Lee makes it sound like an entire cast!\" Remsen Ten Eyck Schenck (\"The Tarleton Murders\") died in Mar. 1992. He was an expert chemist by profession, and his avocations included beekeeping and cryptanalysis, and his contributions to our literature reflected all three interests. He received his Investiture in 1954, and his most widely-known work was his completion of the alphabet of the dancing men, first published in the Apr. 1955 issue of the BSJ, and still used by many Sherlockians. He also was responsible for a delightful bibliohoax: THE PRACTICAL HANDBOOK OF BEE CULTURE, dated 1911 and published in an edition so limited that the few fortunate recipients were warned not to reveal the source of what still is one of the rarest and most imaginative Sherlockian books. Jan 93 #2 The birthday festivities in New York were (as usual) enjoyable, and entertaining. The informal events on Thursday included the Annual Christopher Morley Walk, a meeting of The Pawky Humorists, and the traditional (it only takes two) Aunt Clara Sing at O'Lunney,s Steak House. Friday started with the Mrs. Hudson Breakfast at the Hotel Algonquin and continued with the William Gillette Luncheon at the Old Homestead, w<strong>here</strong> Mr. Gillette (impersonated by Tyke Niver) offered a warm welcome, and Paul Singleton and Andrew and Sarah Montague Joffe performed an excerpt from the Gillette play \"Clarice\". And Otto Penzler offered hospitality (and S'ian books) at his open house at the Mysterious Bookshop."
