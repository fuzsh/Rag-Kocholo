In 1912 Charles Dawson\n\ndiscovered the first of two skulls found in the Piltdown quarry in Sussex, England, skulls of an apparently\n\nprimitive hominid, an ancestor of man. Piltdown man, or Eoanthropus dawsoni to use his scientific name,\n\nwas a sensation. He was the expected \"missing link\" a mixture of human and ape with the noble brow of\n\nHomo sapiens and a primitive jaw. Best of all, he was British!\n\nAs the years went by and new finds of ancient hominids were made, Piltdown man became an anomaly that\n\ndidn't fit in, a creature without a place in the human family tree. Finally, in 1953, the truth came out.\n\nPiltdown man was a hoax, the most ancient of people who never were. This is his story.\n\nMy principal source for the original version of this page is Ronald Millar's The Piltdown Men. This book\n\nis an account of the entire Piltdown affair from beginning to end, including not merely the circumstances\n\nbut the general background of the paleontology and evolutionary theory with respect to human ancestry\n\nduring the period 1850-1950. A number of important books have also been written on the hoax, e.g. works\n\nby Spencer, Weiner, Blinderman, and Walsh, and have been valuable resources.\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\nThe Story Of The Hoax\n\nIn following the history of the hoax it is useful to have a time line showing the principal events. The time\n\nline runs as follows:\n\n1856 -- Neanderthal man discovered\n\n1856 -- Dryopithecus discovered\n\n1859 -- Origin of Species published\n\n1863 -- Moulin Quignon forgeries exposed\n\n1869 -- Cro Magnon man discovered\n\n1871 -- The Descent of Man published\n\n1890 -- Java Man discovered\n\n1898 -- Galley hill \"man\" discovered [modern, misinterpreted]\n\n1903 -- First molar of Peking man found\n\n1907 -- Heidelberg man discovered\n\n1908 -- Dawson (1908-1911) discovers first Piltdown fragments\n\n1909 -- Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin meet\n\n1912 -- February: Dawson contacts Woodward about first skull fragments\n\n1912 -- June: Dawson, Woodward, and Teilhard form digging team\n\n1912 -- June: Team finds elephant molar, skull fragment\n\n1912 -- June: Right parietal skull bones and the jaw bone discovered\n\n1912 -- Summer: Barlow, Pycraft, G.E.

In the next half century finds were made in continental Europe and in Asia but not in\n\nBritain. Finally, in 1912, the sun rose on British paleontology -- fossil remains of an ancient pleistocene\n\nhominid were found in the Piltdown quarries in Sussex. In the period 1912 to 1915 the Piltdown quarries\n\nyielded two skulls, a canine tooth, and a mandible of Eoanthropus, a tool carved from an elephant tusk,\n\nand fossil teeth from a number of pleistocene animals.\n\nThere is a certain vagueness about some of the critical events. Dawson contacted Woodward about the first\n\ntwo skull fragments which were supposedly found by workman \"some years prior\". Exactly when is\n\nunknown. Similarly, the discovery of Piltdown II is shrouded in mystery. Supposedly Dawson and an\n\nanonymous friend make the discovery 1915; however the friend and the location of the find are unknown.\n\nThe reaction to the finds was mixed. On the whole the British paleontologists were enthusiastic; the French\n\nand American paleontologists tended to be skeptical, some objected quite vociferously. The objectors held\n\nthat the jawbone and the skull were obviously from two different animals and that their discovery together\n\nwas simply an accident of placement. In the period 1912-1917 there was a great deal of skepticism. The\n\nreport in 1917 of the discovery of Piltdown II converted many of the skeptics; one accident of placement\n\nwas plausible -- two were not.\n\nIt should be remembered that, at the time of Piltdown finds, there were very few early hominid fossils;\n\nHomo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens were clearly fairly late. It was expected that there was a \"missing\n\nlink\" between ape and man. It was an open question as to what that missing link would look like. Piltdown\n\nman had the expected mix of features, which lent it plausibility as a human precursor.\n\nThis plausibility did not hold up. During the next two decades there were a number of finds of ancient\n\nhominids and near hominids, e.g. Dart's discovery of Australopithecus, the Peking man discoveries, and\n\nother Homo erectus and australopithecine finds. Piltdown man did not fit in with the new discoveries.\n\nNone the less, Sir Arthur Keith (a major defender of Piltdown man) wrote in 1931:\n\nIt is therefore possible that Piltdown man does represent the early pleistocene ancestor of the\n\nmodern type of man, He may well be the ancestor we have been in search of during all these\n\npast years. I am therefore inclined to make the Piltdown type spring from the main ancestral\n\nstem of modern humanity...\n\nIn the period 1930-1950 Piltdown man was increasingly marginalized and by 1950 was, by and large,\n\nsimply ignored. It was carried in the books as a fossil hominid. From time to time it was puzzled over and\n\nthen dismissed again. The American Museum of Natural History quietly classified it as a mixture of ape and\n\nman fossils. Over the years it had become an anomaly; some prominent authors did not even bother to list\n\nit. In Bones of Contention Roger Lewin quotes Sherwood Washburn as saying\n\n\"I remember writing a paper on human evolution in 1944, and I simply left Piltdown out.\n\nYou could make sense of human evolution if you didn't try to put Piltdown into it.\"\n\nFinally, in 1953, the roof fell in. Piltdown man was not an ancestor; it was not a case of erroneous\n\ninterpretation; it was a case of outright deliberate fraud.\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\nForging Fossils\n\nFrom the chronology and the later reconstruction of events it is fairly clear that there never were any\n\nsignificant fossils at the Piltdown quarry. It was salted from time to time with fossils to be found. Once the\n\nhoax was exposed, Sir Kenneth Oakley went on to apply more advanced tests to find where the bones had\n\ncome from and how old they were. His main findings were:\n\nPiltdown I skull: Medieval, human, ~620 years old.\n\nPiltdown II skull: Same source as Piltdown I skull.\n\nPiltdown I jawbone: Orangutan jaw, ~500 years old, probably from Sarawak.\n\nElephant molar: Genuine fossil, probably from Tunisia.\n\nHippopotamus tooth: Genuine fossil, probably from Malta or Sicily.\n\nCanine tooth: Pleistocene chimpanzee fossil.\n\nOriginally it had been believed that one skull had been used; later, more precise dating established in 1989\n\nthat two different skulls had been used, one for each of the two skull \"finds\". The skulls were unusually\n\nthick; a condition that is quite rare in the general population but is common among the Ona indian tribe in\n\nPatagonia. The jawbone was not definitely established as being that of an orangutan until 1982. Drawhorn's\n\npaper summarizes all that is currently known about the provenance of the bones that were used.\n\nNot only were the bones gathered from a variety of sources, they were given a thorough going treatment to\n\nmake them appear to be genuinely ancient. A solution containing iron was used to stain the bones; fossil\n\nbones deposited in gravel pick up iron and manganese. [It is unclear whether the solution also contained\n\nmanganese: Millar mentions that manganese was present; Hall, who did the tests for manganese, says that it\n\nwas not.] Before staining the bones (except for the jawbone) were treated with Chromic acid to convert the\n\nbone apatite (mineral component) to gypsum to facilitate the intake of the iron and manganese (?) solution\n\nused to stain the bones. The skull may have also been boiled in an iron sulphate solution. The canine tooth\n\nwas painted after staining, probably with Van Dyke brown. The jaw bone molars were filed to fit. The\n\nconnection where the jawbone would meet the rest of the skull was carefully broken so that there would be\n\nno evidence of lack of fit. The canine tooth was filed to show wear (and was patched with chewing gum). It\n\nwas filled with sand as it might have been if it had been in the Ouse river bed.\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\nHow the hoax was exposed\n\nWith few exceptions nobody suggested that the finds were a hoax until the very end. The beginning of the\n\nend came when a new dating technique, the fluorine absorption test, became available. The Piltdown fossils\n\nwere dated with this test in 1949; the tests established that the fossils were relatively modern. Even so, they\n\nwere still accepted as genuine. For example, in Nature, 1950, p 165, New Evidence on the Antiquity of\n\nPiltdown Man Oakley wrote:\n\nThe results of the fluorine test have considerably increased the probability that the [Piltdown]\n\nmandible and cranium represent the same creature. The relatively late date indicated by the\n\nsummary of evidence suggests moreover that Piltdown man, far from being an early\n\nprimitive type, may have been a late specialized hominid which evolved in comparative\n\nisolation. In this case the peculiarities of the mandible and the excessive thickness of the\n\ncranium might well be interpreted as secondary or gerontic developments.\n\nIn 1925 Edmonds had pointed out that Dawson was in error in his geological dating of the Piltdown\n\ngravels: they were younger than Dawson had assumed. In 1951 he published an article pointing out that\n\nthere was no plausible source for the Piltdown animal fossils. Millar (p203) writes:\n\nThe older group of Piltdown animals, he said, were alleged to have been washed from a\n\nPliocene land deposit in the Weald. Edmonds thought there must be some misunderstanding.\n\nThere was no Pliocene land deposit in the entire Weald which could have produced them. the\n\nonly local Pliocene beds were marine in origin and lay above the five-hundred foot contour\n\nline.\n\nIn July 1953 an international congress of paleontologists, under the auspices of the Wenner-Gren\n\nFoundation, was held in London. The world's fossil men were put up, admired and set down again. But,\n\naccording to Dr. J.S. Weiner, Piltdown man got barely a mention. He did not fit in. He was a piece of the\n\njig-saw puzzle; the right colour but the wrong shape. It was at the congress that the possibility of fraud\n\ndawned on Weiner. Once the possibility had raised it was easy to establish that the finds were a fraud.\n\nMillar writes:\n\nThe original Piltdown teeth were produced and examined by the three scientists. The\n\nevidence of fake could seen immediately. The first and second molars were worn to the same\n\ndegree; the inner margins of the lower teeth were more worn than the outer -- the 'wear' was\n\nthe wrong way round; the edges of the teeth were sharp and unbevelled; the exposed areas of\n\ndentine were free of shallow cavities and flush with the surrounding enamel; the biting\n\nsurface of the two molars did not form a uniform surface, the planes were out of alignment.\n\nThat the teeth might have been misplaced after the death of Piltdown man was considered but\n\nan X-ray showed the lower contact surfaces of the roots were correctly positioned. This\n\nX-ray also revealed that contrary to the 1916 radiograph the roots were unnaturally similar\n\nin length and disposition.\n\nThe molar surface were examined under a microscope. They were scarred by criss-cross\n\nscratches suggesting the use of an abrasive. 'The evidences of artificial abrasion immediately\n\nsprang to the eye' wrote Le Gros Clark. 'Indeed so obvious did they [the scratches] seem it\n\nmay well be asked -- how was it that they had escaped notice before?' He answered his\n\nquestion with a beautiful simplicity. 'They had never been looked for...nobody previously\n\nhad examined the Piltdown jaw with the idea of a possible forgery in mind, a deliberate\n\nfabrication.'\n\nWhy then was the fraud so successful? Briefly, (a) the team finding the specimans (Dawson, Woodward,\n\nTeilhard) had excellent credentials, (b) incompetence on the part of the British Paleontological community,\n\n(c) the relatively primitive analytical tools available circa 1920, (d) skill of the forgery, (e) it matched what\n\nwas expected from theory, and (f) as Millar remarks, the hoax led a charmed life.\n\nCredentials\n\nAs a matter of practice, a fraud or hoax is much more likely to succeed if it appears to be validated by an\n\nauthority. In general, one does not expect a professional in a field to concoct a hoax. Experience teaches\n\nthat this expectation is not always met.\n\nIncompetence\n\nAlthough the team had excellent credentials none was truly competent in dealing with hominid fossils; their\n\nexpertise lay elsewhere. The British museum people, Woodward and Pycraft, made numerous errors of\n\nreconstruction and interpretation. The only expert in the expanded team, Grafton Eliot Smith, was\n\nstrangely silent about some of the errors.\n\nPrimitive analytical tools\n\nIt is hard for us today to fully grasp how primitive the analytical tools available to the paleontologists of\n\nthat time were. Chemical tests and dating techniques taken for granted today were not available. The\n\nanalysis of the details of tooth wear was less worked out. The simple knowledge of geology was much less\n\ndetailed. The importance of careful establishment of the provenance of fossils was not appreciated. In\n\nshort, the paleontologists of 1915 were an easier lot to fool.\n\nSkill of the forgery\n\nAt the time there were virtually no hominid fossils finds except for some of the early Neanderthal finds.\n\nThe reconstruction of human evolution was very much an open question. The Piltdown specimens fit one of\n\nthe leading speculations. The forger knew what anatomical and paleontological tests the specimens would be\n\ngiven.\n\nMeeting Theoretical Expectations\n\nAs Hammond points out, a key reason why the hoax succeeded was because it fit in very well with the\n\ntheories of the time. Boule had recently (erroneously) discredited Neanderthal man as being close to the\n\nmain hominid line (1908-1912). Elliot Smith felt that the large brain case would have developed first.\n\nSollas did not, but did strongly support mosaic evolution, i.e., features appearing in patches rather in a\n\nsmooth transition. It was his opinion that human dentition developed before the human jaw. Woodward and\n\nothers believed that eoliths (supposed very early stone tools) indicated the presence of an early, intelligent\n\nhominid in England. Piltdown man, with his large braincase, his simian jaw, and his near human dentition\n\nfit the theoretical picture.\n\nCharmed Life\n\nThe hoax had a charmed life. Features that might have exposed the hoax didn't get caught because of small\n\nerrors in procedure. For example, the hoax would have been exposed immediately had a test of the jaw for\n\norganic matter been made. Tests were made on the cranial fragments, but these were sufficiently well\n\nmineralized to pass.\n\nThe X-rays taken were of poor quality, even for the time. The dentist Lyne pointed out the incongruity\n\nbetween the heavy wear on the canine and its large pulp cavity, a sign of youth. This was interpreted as\n\nsecondary dentine formation, an explanation that \"worked\" because of the poor quality of the X-rays.\n\nThe erroneous wear pattern on the molars, which was obvious when Weiner looked at the casts, was never\n\nnoticed. Nor were they carefully examined under a microscope -- the abrasion marks would have been\n\nseen.\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\nWho perpetrated the hoax?\n\nClick here to go directly to the perpetrator list\n\nWho did it? Who perpetrated the hoax? When the hoax was exposed nobody knew who the perpetrator was.\n\nNo one confessed to the deed. For forty odd years people have speculated about the identity of the culprit;\n\nover time an impressive list of suspects has accumulated. The case against each suspect has been\n\ncircumstantial, a constellation of suspicious behaviour, of possible motives, and of opportunity. In this\n\nsection we present summaries of the arguments against the principal candidates.\n\nA comprehensive listing of the accusations, when they were made, who made them, and who the accused\n\nwere can be found in Tom Turrittin's Piltdown man overview; it includes details not given here including\n\nthe particulars of 30 separate books or papers making accusations.\n\nWhen the hoax was first exposed Dawson, Teilhard, and Woodward were the obvious suspects; they had\n\nmade the major finds. In 1953 Weiner fingered Dawson as the culprit. Stephen Jay Gould argued that\n\nTeilhard and Dawson were the culprits. Woodward generally escaped suspicion; however Drawhorn made\n\na strong case against him in 1994. Grafton Elliot Smith and Sir Arthur Keith were prominent scientists that\n\nplayed key roles in the discovery. Millar argued that Smith was the culprit; Spencer argued that it was a\n\nconspiracy between Dawson and Keith. Other candidates that have been mentioned over the years include\n\nArthur Conan Doyle, the geologist W. J. Sollas, and the paleontologist Martin Hinton. This is by no means\n\nthe end of the list; other people accused include Hargreaves, Abbot, Barlow, and Butterfield.\n\nThis fraud is quite unique. Most scientific frauds and hoaxes fall into a few categories. There are student\n\njapes, students conconcting evidence to fit a superior's theories. There are confirming evidence frauds, in\n\nwhich a researcher fabricates findings that they believe should be true. There are outright frauds for\n\nmoney, fossils that are fabricated for gullible collectors. There are rare cases of fabrication for reputation,\n\ndone in the knowledge that the results will not be checked. And, upon occasion, there are frauds concocted\n\nsimply as an expression of a perverse sense of humor.\n\nThe Piltdown hoax does not seem to fit any of these categories well. This was not an ordinary hoax; it was\n\na systematic campaign over the years to establish the existence of Piltdown man. The early skull fragments\n\nwere created in advance and salted with the foreknowledge that more extensive finds would be planted\n\nlater. The hoaxer had to have good reason to believe that the salted fossils would be found.\n\nOne of the critical factors in any theory is to account for the fact that the perpetrator had to be confident\n\nthat the salted fossils would be found. That suggests that either Dawson, Teilhard, or Woodward was\n\ninvolved since they alone made the initial finds. At first sight it would seem that Dawson must have been\n\nguilty since he made the initial find of the first two skull fragments. However he didn't! They were made\n\nby anonymous workmen. The \"find\" could have been arranged for a handful of coins. As Vere pointed out,\n\nthe labourer Hargreaves, employed to do most of the digging, was also present at the site.\n\nAnother critical factor to be accounted for is access to the specimens that were used in the hoax. Likewise\n\nthe question of skill and knowledge required for the hoax must be taken into account.\n\nBelow are summaries of the cases to be made against the various possible perpetrators. At the moment this\n\nsection is very much under construction!\n\nThe candidates for perpetrator\n\nWas it Abbot?\n\nWas it Barlow?\n\nWas it Butterfield?\n\nWas it Dawson?\n\nWas it Dawson and Keith?\n\nWas it Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?\n\nWas it Hargreaves?\n\nWas it Martin Hinton?\n\nWas it Martin Hinton and others?\n\nWas it Grafton Elliot Smith?\n\nWas it W. J. Sollas?\n\nWas it Teilhard de Chardin?\n\nWas Woodward the perpetrator?\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Abbot the forger?\n\nLewis Abbot, owner of a Hastings jewelry shop, friend of Dawson, and widely respected for his knowledge\n\nof the geology of southern England. He was considered as a possibility by Weiner. Blinderman make a\n\nmajor accusation against Abbot, based on an assessment of personality, requisite knowledge, and probable\n\naccess to the needed bones. The case, however, lacked any definite substance. Abbot has also been\n\nmentioned as a possible co-conspirator in a number of accusations.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Barlow the forger?\n\nBarlow was accused of being a co-conspirator with Dawson by Caroline Grigson, the curator of the\n\nOntodontological Museum. The accusation has not been taken seriously.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Butterfield the forger?\n\nButterfield, the curator at the Hastings museum, was accused by van Esbroeck of being the forger with\n\nHargreaves planting the forged fossils. The proposed motive is revenge over Dawson's appropriation of\n\nsome dinosaur fossils. There is no substantive evidence for this charge.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Dawson the sole forger?\n\nDawson is the obvious suspect. He made the initial find of the two skull fragments and the Piltdown II find.\n\nIn both of these critical discoveries there is no confirmation by another party. He was the one who made\n\nthe Piltdown quarry a special object of search. Indeed he is such an obvious suspect (Weiner seems to have\n\ntaken it for granted that Dawson was the forger) that the question is -- why consider any one besides\n\nDawson? Millar (p 226-7) argues against Dawson as the culprit as follows:\n\nOne of my main objections to the assumption that Dawson is inevitably the culprit is that as\n\nthe discoverer he was wide open to suspicion. He is too obvious a culprit... If the bogus fossil\n\nexcaped detection by his friends at the museum he surely could not have expected that it\n\nwould withstand scientific enquiry forever. I find it impossible to believe that Dawson would\n\npit his meagre knowledge of anatomy (if it is accepted that he had any at all) against that of\n\nany skilled human anatomist... The threat of exposure would be perpetual.\n\nAs it was Piltdown man had a charmed life. Because of the poor quality of the original X-ray\n\nphotographs the bogus jaw remained undetected at the outset. Le Gros Clark has emphasized\n\nthat the forger's crude workmanship on the teeth was there for all to see if only someone had\n\nlooked for it.\n\nMillar's argument sounds plausible but it doesn't stand up well. Dawson was a man of many interests, both\n\nantiquarian and paleontological, and had numerous knowledgeable friends and acquaintances. The requisite\n\nknowledge could readily have been acquired. The argument that he wouldn't have dared is suspect; there is\n\nconsiderable evidence that Dawson had been involved in a number of forgeries and plagarisms; some of\n\nwhich only came to light after Millar wrote. Walsh discusses a number of incidents:\n\nThe Beauport Statuette\n\nThe Blackmore flint weapon\n\nThe Bexhill boat\n\nThe Uckfield horseshoe\n\nThe Hastings clockface\n\nThe Dene Holes plagarism\n\nThe Iron Industry in Old Sussex plagarism\n\nThe Old Sussex Glass plagarism\n\nThe Hastings Castle plagarism\n\nThe Pevensey Brick\n\nA critical point, which Walsh emphasizes, was the discovery of the jawbone by Dawson. Most of the other\n\nbones were found in spill, dug up gravel which was searched later after having been dug up. The jawbone,\n\nhowever, was found in situ by Dawson. He struck a blow into the hardpacked gravel and the jawbone\n\npopped out (this was reported by Woodward). It would have been very difficult to bury the jawbone in the\n\nhardpacked gravel convincingly; however no one except Dawson actually observed the purported\n\nundisturbed location of the jawbone before it was found.\n\nIn retrospect it is hard to see how Dawson could not have been involved. Walsh argues strongly that\n\nDawson and Dawson alone was the culprit, that he had both the necessary knowledge and the requisite\n\ncharacter, and that his participation was physically necessary. Indeed, one might ask why someone\n\nproposing to undertake such a fraud would risk having a co-conspirator. However it happens often enough\n\nthat people of similar inclinations recognize each other.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWere Dawson and Keith conspirators?\n\nThe following is an excerpt taken from a summary published by Robert Parson in the talk.origins\n\nnewsgroup.\n\nIn the late 1970's, Ian Langham, an Australian historian of science, began a comprehensive reevaluation of\n\nthe events surrounding the forgery. Langham was initially attracted to Ronald Millar's hypothesis that the\n\nforger was Grafton Elliot Smith; however he later dropped this hypothesis and settled instead upon Sir\n\nArthur Keith. Langham died suddenly in 1984, before revealing his conclusions, and Frank Spencer, of the\n\nDepartment of Anthropology at Queens College of the City University of New York, was appointed to\n\ncomplete Langham's research. Spencer published his and Langham's conclusions in Piltdown: A Scientific\n\nForgery.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Langham-Spencer argument is an anonymous article that appeared in the British\n\nMedical Journal on 21 December 1912, three days after the formal announcement of the discovery of\n\nPiltdown Man at a Geological Society meeting. This article appears superficially to be a mere summary of\n\nthe meeting, but in fact it contains information (relating to the exact location of the site and to the history\n\nof the discovery) that at that time was known only by the people actually involved in the digging. Arthur\n\nSmith Woodward found this puzzling and wondered who the author had been and how he had learned about\n\nthese details, but never found out. 70 years later Ian Langham discovered that the author was Arthur Keith.\n\nMoreover, Keith's diary showed that he had written the article three days before the meeting actually took\n\nplace. Keith was not a part of Woodward's inner circle at this time, and he had not been consulted by\n\nWoodward on the discovery; indeed, he had only been allowed to view the specimens two weeks before the\n\nofficial announcement, even though the existence of the find (though not the details) had been an open\n\nsecret for many weeks beforehand.\n\nThis discovery (and similar, more ambiguous documents) suggested to Langham a connection between\n\nDawson and Keith. Keith claimed to have met Dawson for the first time in January 1913, but Langham\n\nfound evidence that they had met at least three times during 1911-1912. He also noticed that Keith had\n\ndestroyed all of his correspondence with Dawson. Langham proposed that Dawson began to prepare the\n\nhoax sometime between 1905 and 1910. In mid-1911 Keith was brought into it, and during the period\n\n1911-12 Keith prepared the various specimens, Dawson planted them, and Dawson's team subsequently dug\n\nthem up.\n\nThe case against Keith is discussed in detail by Walsh. According to his analysis the circumstantial evidence\n\nall has a natural and innocent explanation.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Arthur Conan Doyle the perpetrator?\n\nThe argument for Doyle was made in an article in Science in 1983 by the anthropologist John Winslow.\n\nThe Spring 1996 issue of Pacific Discovery has an excellent article by Robert Anderson on the Doyle\n\ntheory. Doyle was a neighbour of Dawson, was an amateur bone hunter, and participated briefly in the\n\ndigs. The principal arguments for Doyle as the culprit are circumstantial and literary; it has been argued\n\nthat The Lost World describes the execution of the hoax in veiled terms. Anderson argues that the exact\n\nlocation of the planted fossils is spelled out in The Lost World as a puzzle. The essential weakness of the\n\ncase against Doyle is that it would not have been possible for him to have planted the bones with any\n\nexpectation that they would have been found. Walsh analyzes the case against Doyle in detail and finds it\n\nwanting.\n\nThe principal proponent of the Doyle theory,Richard Milner who is a historian of science from the\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, still holds Doyle was responsible. In a debate staged by the Linnaean\n\nSociety in March 1997 as part of National Science Week he argued the case for Arthur Conan Doyle and\n\nagainst the case for Hinton.\n\nSir Arthur was a zealous spiritualist, embittered by the exposure and prosecution of Henry Slade, one of his\n\nfavourite psychics. It is suggested that Doyle sought to discredit the scientific establishment by faking\n\nevidence of something they wanted to believe in thereby showing scientists knew less than they thought they\n\ndid.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Hargreaves involved?\n\nHargreaves, the laborer who did most of the digging at the Piltdown site, was accused by Vere. There is no\n\ndirect evidence against him. However, unlike many others, he had real opportunity to plant the fossils. If\n\nDawson and Woodward were not involved he almost must have been involved.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Martin Hinton the perpetrator?\n\nThe May 23, 1996 edition of Nature presents the new case and a smoking gun (?) against Martin A. C.\n\nHinton, a curator of zoology at the museum at the time of the fraud. There are two finds of bones stained\n\nand carved in the manner of the Piltdown fossils, a canvas travelling trunk marked with Hinton's initials\n\nand glass tubes from Hinton's estate (Hinton died in 1961) which contained human teeth stained in various\n\nways.\n\nThe trunk was found in the mid-1970s, when contractors were clearing loft space in the British Museum.\n\nThe trunk contained hundreds of vials of rodent dissections (Hinton was a rodent specialist) and a collection\n\nof carved and stained pieces of fossil hippopotamus and elephant teeth, as well as assorted bones, that\n\nlooked as if they belonged in the Piltdown collection.\n\nThe Nature article claimed that the teeth from the the estate, the contents of the trunk, and the Piltdown\n\nremains were stained with the same chemical recipe, a mixture of iron, managanese and chromium. The\n\nrecipe appears to have been invented by Hinton and is based on a knowledge of post-depositional processes\n\naffecting fossils in gravel. Hinton had published a paper in 1899 showing that fossils in river gravels would\n\nbe impregnated with oxides of iron and manganese, staining them a characteristic chocolate- brown colour.\n\nThe motive may have revenge in a quarrel about money or it may simply have been that Woodward was\n\nirritatingly stuffy. Hinton was fond of and was famed for his elaborate practical jokes. Hinton was a\n\nmember of a circle of Sussex-based geologist colleagues and was an expert on the Weald geology. In 1954,\n\nshortly after the exposure Hinton wrote a revealing letter to Gavin de Beer director of the British Museum\n\n(Natural History):\n\nThe temptation to invent such a 'discovery' of an ape-like man associated with late Pliocene\n\nMammals in a Wealden gravel might well have proved irresistable to some unbalanced\n\nmember of old Ben Harrison's circe at Ightham. He and his friends (of whom I was one)\n\nwere always talking of the possibility of finding a late Pliocene deposit in the weald.\n\nAndrew Currant, a researcher at the museum and Brian Gardiner, professor of palaeontology at King's\n\nCollege, London, made the investigations into the Hinton evidence. Gardiner presented the case against\n\nHinton in his presidential address to the Linnean Society in London on May 24, 1996.\n\nThe case against Hinton is not what it seems. The motive suggested by Gardiner (a quarrel about money)\n\ndoes not work because of timing; the incident in question happened in 1911; the first finds were in 1908.\n\nMore importantly the chemical analyses do not match. The Hinton samples include Manganese; the\n\nPiltdown specimens do not. The Hinton samples do not contain gypsum (produced from the organic\n\nmaterial); the Piltdown specimens do. [Drawhorn, correspondence]. Walsh notes that there were legitimate\n\nreasons for Hinton to have this material, including doing tests for Oakley. In any event it would have been\n\nphysically impossible for Hinton to have been the sole hoaxer because he did not have the requisite access to\n\nthe site in the 1912-1914 period.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas it Hinton and others?\n\nAlthough the physical evidence is ambiguous, Hinton's name pops up under a variety of odd circumstances\n\nand it seems likely that he knew more that he should have, either by virtue of being a co-conspirator or by\n\nvirtue of special knowledge not publicly admitted.\n\nIn 1981 L. Harrison Matthews wrote a series of articles in the New Scientist on the Piltdown hoax. In\n\nthese article he suggested that Hinton believed the finds to be a hoax and that Hinton and Teilhard\n\nmanufactured and planted ridiculous forgeries to expose the hoax. In particular the Elephant bone tool was\n\na crude cricket bat, appropriate for \"the earliest Englishman\". This theory was repeated in 1982 in\n\nBetrayers of the Truth by Broad and Wade, and in 1996 in The Common but Less Frequent Loon and\n\nOther Essays by Keith S. Thomson.\n\nL. Harrison Matthews described informal dinner conversations in the period 1945-51 during which Hinton\n\nimplied that \"Piltdown was not a subject to be taken seriously\" from which Matthews surmised that Hinton\n\n\"knew more about the hoax and the museum's part in it than he ever admitted\". Other evidence referred to\n\nby Matthews included Hinton's correspondence after the hoax was exposed and subsequent conversations in\n\nwhich Hinton obliquely included himself in a small list of suspects. Matthews was sufficiently confident\n\nabout Hinton's involvement that he was the first to suggest the oft-repeated claim that the first finds were\n\ndue to Dawson and that in response, Hinton manufactured and planted ridiculous forgeries to expose the\n\nhoax. This is a relatively honorable role for Hinton in comparison with sole hoaxer. It is clear that\n\nMatthews respected Hinton, with whom he shared many wide-ranging and interesting conversations during\n\nHinton's retirement. It is likely that Matthews was unable to conceive of his friend being the initiator and\n\nsolely responsible for the fraud.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Grafton Elliot Smith the perpetrator?\n\nMillar argues that Smith was the culprit. Smith was an expert anatomist, and a paleontologist with ready\n\naccess to a wide variety of fossils. He was suspiciously quiet when Woodward messed up the construction of\n\nthe Piltdown I skull. He \"failed to recognize\" that the cranial bones of Piltdown II belonged to Piltdown I\n\nwhereas Hrdlicka recognized that the Piltdown II molar came from Piltdown I after a brief examination.\n\nMillar notes:\n\nI have examined all of Smith's writings on the subject with care and in not one instance does\n\nhe fail to state carefully that his findings were based on the examination of a plaster cast of\n\nthe skull.\n\nIt is quite unlikely that Smith had not examined the actual skull fragments. Smith was in Nubia during most\n\nof the discoveries; however he came to England at convenient points. Smith had the right kind of\n\npersonality. When Millar discussed the possibility of Smith with Oakley, Oakley was not surprised. There\n\nis, however, no direct evidence against Smith. As with other \"outsider\" theories it was physically\n\nimpossible for Smith to have been the sole hoaxer.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas W. J. Sollas the perpetrator?\n\nW. J. Sollas was a Professor of Geology at Oxford and a bitter enemy of Woodward. He was accused in\n\n1978 by his successor in the Oxford chair, J. A. Douglas, in a posthumously released tape recording. The\n\nessential difficulty with this theory is to explain how Sollas (or another outsider) could have salted the\n\nPiltdown site and be sure the fake fossils would be found. One also wonders why, if Sollas were the\n\nperpetrator, he did not expose the hoax and thereby damaging Woodward's reputation. This could have\n\nbeen done behind the scenes easily enough by asking the right questions.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Teilhard de Chardin the perpetrator?\n\nIn an essay reprinted in The Panda's Thumb, Stephen Jay Gould argues the case for a conspiracy by\n\nTeilhard de Chardin and Dawson. The case is circumstantial. The suggested motive is a student jape\n\n(Teilhard was quite young at the time.) It was supposed that Teilhard did not have the opportunity;\n\nhowever Gould shows that this was not necessarily so. Much of Gould's case rests on ambiguous wording in\n\nTeilhard's correspondence. Certainly Teilhard is a plausible candidate for the mysterious friend who\n\nhelped discover Piltdown II. Gould argues that they had intended to blow the gaffe shortly after the initial\n\nfinds but that they were prevented from doing so by WW I. By 1918 things had gotten out of hand to the\n\npoint where the hoax could no longer be owned up to.\n\nI do not think that Gould's assessment of motive stands up well. It is plausible that Teilhard might have\n\nconcocted a hoax; that is common for frisky students. However this fraud was planned and prepared years\n\nin advance and was executed over an extended period of time; the nature of the execution of the fraud goes\n\nwell beyond the student jape.\n\nThe case against Teilhard is considered in detail by Walsh. He argues fairly convincingly that many of the\n\ncircumstances stressed by Gould have natural and plausible explanations.\n\nTeilhard was also accused of being involved by L. Harrison Matthews who claimed that Teilhard planted\n\nthe fossil canine tooth in collaboration with Martin A.C. Hinton, with Teilhard subsequently \"discovering\"\n\nthe tooth. The evidence for this collaboration is that Hinton told his friend Richard Savage that Hinton and\n\nTeilhard had visited the site together early in 1913. Matthews commented that Teilhard never mentioned\n\nthis visit, and subsequent developments have damaged Hinton's credibility regarding these clues.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\nWas Woodward the perpetrator?\n\nWoodward seems to have escaped serious consideration, primarily because he was very much a \"straight\n\narrow\". However there is a strong case to be made against Woodward as a co-conspirator with Dawson.\n\nThe provenance of many of bones used in the construction of the Piltdown specimens has been established;\n\nsome were not at all readily available. Woodward, and apparently only Woodward, had professional access\n\nto all of them. The main focus of Drawhorn's paper is a consideration of this question of the origin of the\n\nspecimens and who could have provided them.\n\nWoodward had strong motives. He benefitted directly as co-discoverer of a monumental find. During the\n\nperiod in question he was engaged in an ardent campaign for the position of Director of the BMNH, a\n\ncampaign in which his tactics were distinctly not \"straight-arrowish\". The finds directly confirmed the\n\northogenetic theories that he was advocating.\n\nWoodward's participation would explain many of the seemingly fortunate circumstances that allowed the\n\nhoax to survive. For example, the hoax would have failed immediately if the jawbone had been tested for\n\norganic material; it never was. Dawson, as a single hoaxer, could have arranged that only skull fragments\n\nbe tested initially. However it was Woodward who kept Keith from testing the Piltdown specimens even\n\nthough he had used Keith's services before and after. It was Woodward who carefully restricted access to\n\nthe specimens. At no time did Woodward give the specimens the careful physical examination that would\n\nhave exposed the hoax. The vagueness about the location of the second find is peculiar. At one point he\n\ndesignated the site as being at a particular farm on the Netherfield side of the Ouse; later he \"forgot\" this\n\nand designated it as being on the Sheffield Park side, location unknown. Millar remarked on the \"charmed\n\nlife\" of the hoax. Perhaps the charmed life was stage managed.\n\nIt has been argued that Woodward's correspondence with Dawson establishes his innocence. This is not so.\n\nIf Woodward were a conspirator their correspondence would have been artifacts, part of the hoax. It\n\nshould be remembered that copies of Museum correspondence were kept as part of the official record. For\n\nmany years afterward Woodward returned to the Piltdown site for further digs; nothing was found. This\n\nmay be the best argument for his innocence.\n\nAlthough a strong case against Woodward can be made it is not definite. It is impossible to prove that\n\nDawson did not have access to all of the specimens used to construct the hoax. Woodward's \"errors\" could\n\nhave been unfortunate incompetence.\n\nBack to perpetrator list\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\nMyths and misconceptions\n\nPiltdown man has been the focus of many myths and misconceptions, many of which are assiduously\n\nrepeated by creationists for whom Piltdown man is a popular club with which to assail evolution. They\n\ninclude:\n\n[It's all the British Museum's fault]\n\n[The hoax was swallowed uncritically]\n\n[500 doctoral theses were written on Piltdown man]\n\n[This is a good example of Science correcting itself]\n\n[The hoax was unimportant]\n\nIt's all the British Museum's fault\n\nGould and others have criticized the British Museum for keeping the fossils \"under wraps\". suggesting that\n\nthe hoax might have been exposed much earlier. It is true that access to the fossils were restricted. This is\n\nnormal practice for rare and valuable fossils. However it is doubtful that this \"security\" protected the hoax.\n\nThe fossils were available for examination. The tests that exposed the hoax could have been performed at\n\nany time. The single most important thing that protected the hoax from exposure was that nobody thought\n\nof the possibility. However in reading the history of the find it is clear that the leading paleontologists had\n\naccess to the Piltdown man specimans. For example, Hrdlicka examined them; his rejection of the mandible\n\nand cranium being from the same animal was based on direct examination. Following the revelation of the\n\nfraud Martin Hinton, Deputy Keeper in the Dept. of Zoology at the British Museum. wrote to the Times:\n\nHad the investigators been permitted to handle the actual specimens, I think the spurious\n\nnature of the jaw would have been detected long ago.\n\nWilfred Le Gros Clark, a member of the team that exposed the forger, wrote to Hinton reminding him that\n\nWoodward had in fact allowed other specialists to examine the originals. The charge seems to have stuck,\n\nhowever. (Frank Spencer, The Piltdown Forgery, p. 149).\n\nIt does seem to be the case that access to the fossils was quite restricted in later years. In his\n\nautobiographical book By the Evidence Leakey said when he saw Piltdown in 1933:\n\nI was not allowed to handle the originals in any way, but merely to look at them and satisfy\n\nmyself that the casts were really good replicas. Then, abruptly, the originals were removed\n\nand locked up again, and I was left for the rest of the morning with only the casts to study.\n\nBack to myths and misconceptions\n\nThe hoax was swallowed uncritically\n\nThis is a half truth; almost no one publicly raised the possibility of a deliberate hoax. There were rumors\n\ncirculating, however. William Gregory, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History wrote\n\nin Natural History in May of 1914:\n\n\"It has been suspected by some that geologically [the bones] are not that old at all; that they\n\nmay even represent a deliberate hoax, a negro or Australian skull and a broken ape jaw,\n\nartificially fossilized and planted in the grave bed, to fool scientists.\"\n\nHe went on, however, to vigorously deny the charge, concluding\n\n\"None of the experts who have scrutinized the specimens and the gravel pit and its\n\nsurroundings has doubted the genuineness of the discovery.\"\n\nIn general, however, the finds were accepted as being genuine fossils but were not accepted uncritically as\n\nbeing from an ancient human ancestor. There was an early and recurring doubt that the jaw and the skull\n\nwere from two different animals, that the jaw was from an archaic chimpanzee and that the skull was from\n\na relatively modern human being. Notable critics include Dr. David Waterston of King's College, the\n\nFrench paleontologists Marcellin Boule and Ernest Robert Lenoir, Gerrit Miller, curator of mammals at\n\nthe Smithsonian, and Professor Ales Hrdlicka.\n\nInitially there were many more critics, e.g. Osborn. However the finding of the second skull converted\n\nmany of the critics. Finding a jaw from one animal near the skull of another might be an accident of\n\njuxtaposition -- two such finds is quite unlikely to be an accident. Some critics, e.g. Lenoir and Hrdlicka\n\nremained unconvinced none-the-less.\n\nThe following quote comes from a \"The Evolution of Man\", a 1927 book by Grafton Elliot Smith:\n\n\"Yet it [the skullcap] was found in association with the fragment of a jaw presenting so close\n\na resemblance to the type hitherto known only in Apes that for more than twelve years many\n\ncompetent biologists have been claiming it to be the remains of a Chimpanzee.\"\n\nFranz Weidenreich in 1946, in his book \"Apes, Giants, and Men\" (Note that Weidenreich was an extremely\n\nrespected scientist, having done most of the work on the Peking Man skulls):\n\nIn this connection, another fact should be considered. We know of a lower jaw from the\n\nLower Pleistocene of southern England which is anatomically, without any doubt, the jaw of\n\nan anthropoid. The trouble is that this jaw, although generally acknowledged as a simian jaw,\n\nhas been attributed to man because it was found mixed with fragments of an undoubtedly\n\nhuman brain case. I am referring to the famous Piltdown finds and to Eoanthropus, as the\n\nreconstructed human type has been called by the English authors... Therefore, both skeletal\n\nelements cannot belong to the same skull.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that in 1950 Ashley Montagu and Alvan T. Marston mounted major attacks on\n\nthe interpretation of the Piltdown fossils as being from a single animal.\n\nBack to myths and misconceptions\n\n500 doctoral dissertations were written on Piltdown man\n\nThis claim appears in creationist sources. Gary Parker's pamphlet \"Origin of Mankind\", Impact series\n\n#101, Creation-Life Publishers (1981) makes the claim without qualification or source. Lubenow's Bones\n\nof Contention (1992) remarks that it is said that there were 500 doctoral dissertations but does not give a\n\nsource.\n\nThis claim is clearly in error. When one considers the small number of PhD's in paleontology being\n\ngranted currently and the even smaller number 80 years ago and the diversity of topics chosen for PhD\n\ntheses a figure of half a dozen seems generous; in all probability there were none whatsoever. John Rice\n\nCole notes that in the 20s there were about 2 dissertations per year in physical anthropology in the entire\n\nUS on ANY topic.\n\nRobert Parson made a systematic search of the bibliographies of The Piltdown Forgery by Weiner, The\n\nPiltdown Inquest by Blinderman, Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery and The Piltdown Papers by Spencer,\n\nThe Antiquity of Man (1925) and New Discoveries Relating to the Antiquity of Man (1931) by Sir\n\nArthur Keith. Spencer and Keith's works have extensive references and bibliographies of the primary\n\nresearch literature. There are no references to any doctoral dissertations. Likewise Millar's bibliography\n\ncontains no references to any doctoral dissertation.\n\nIt is not clear whether this claim is a simple fabrication or whether it is an erroneous transcription from\n\nanother source. In the introduction to The Piltdown Men (1972), Millar says \"it is estimated that some\n\nfive hundred essays were written about [Piltdown man]\". This estimate is credible, the 1920 edition of H.G.\n\nWells' The Outline of History remarks \"more than a hundred books, pamphlets, and papers have been\n\nwritten [about Piltdown Man]\". W. & A. Quenstedt listed over 300 references in 1936 in Hominidae\n\nfossiles. Fossilium Catalogus I: Animalia, 74: 191-197.\n\nMillar gives no source, evidently not considering the matter to be important enough to document. However\n\nit probably was the editorial in the 10 July 1954 issue of Nature (vol. 274, # 4419, pp. 61-62) which\n\ndescribes a meeting of the Geological Society (30 June 1954) devoted to the exposure of the hoax. The\n\neditorial (unsigned) says:\n\n\"It is agreed that the skull fragments are human and not of great antiquity; that the jawbone is\n\nape; that they have no important evolutionary significance. More than five hundred articles\n\nand memoirs are said to have been written about Piltdown man. His rise and fall are a\n\nsalutary example of human motives, mischief and mistake.\"\n\nBy coincidence, Spencer's The Piltdown Papers (1990) contains 500 letters, i.e. 500 items of\n\ncorrespondence between Piltdown principals. However this cannot be the source of the number 500 since\n\nThe Piltdown Papers appeared well after Parker's pamphlet and Millar's book.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for this myth is that Millar and Parker both used the same source, the\n\nNature editorial, and that Parker assumed that papers and memoirs were dissertations. In turn Lubenow's\n\nsource was probably the Parker pamphlet. The truth, however, is unknown.\n\nBack to myths and misconceptions\n\nThis is a good example of Science correcting itself\n\nIt has been argued that this is a good example of science correcting its errors. This argument is a bit\n\nroseate. As the Daily Sketch wrote:\n\nAnthropologists refer to the hoax as 'another instance of desire for fame leading a scholar\n\ninto dishonesty' and boast that the unmasking of the deception is 'a tribute to the persistence\n\nand skill of modern research'. Persistence and skill indeed! When they have taken over forty\n\nyears to discover the difference between an ancient fossil and a modern chimpanzee! A\n\nchimpanzee could have done it quicker.\n\nFar from being a triumph of Science the hoax points to common and dangerous faults. The hoax succeeded\n\nin large part because of the slipshod nature of the testing applied to it; careful examination using the\n\nmethods available at the time would have immediately revealed the hoax. This failure to adquately examine\n\nthe fossils went unmarked and unnoticed at the time - in large part because the hoax admirably satisfied the\n\ntheoretical expectations of the time.\n\nThe hoax illuminates two pitfalls to be wary of in the scientific process. The first is the danger of\n\ninadequately examining and challenging results that confirm the currently accepted scientific interpretation.\n\nThe second is that a result, once established, tends to be uncritically accepted and relied upon without\n\nfurther reconsideration.\n\nBack to myths and misconceptions\n\nThe hoax was unimportant\n\nRobert Parson pointed out in a talk.origins posting that the Piltdown hoax was a scientific disaster of the\n\nfirst magnitude. He said:\n\nPiltdown \"confirmed\" hypotheses about our early ancestors that were in fact wrong -\n\nspecifically, that the brain case developed before the jaw. The early Australopithecine fossils\n\nfound by Dart in South Africa in the 1920's failed to receive the attention due to them for\n\nthis reason. The entire reconstruction of the history of the evolution of humanity was thrown\n\noff track until the 1930's.\n\nProminent anthropologists, such as Arthur Smith Woodward, Arthur Keith, and Grafton\n\nElliot Smith, wasted years of their lives exploring the properties of what turned out to be a\n\nfake. The lingering suspicion that one of them might have been involved in the forgery will\n\ncloud their reputations forever.\n\nMore than five hundred articles and memoirs were written about the Piltdown finds before the hoax was\n\nexposed; these were all wasted effort. Likewise articles in encyclopedias and sections in text books and\n\npopular books of science were simply wrong. It should be recognized that an immense amount of\n\nderivative work is based upon a relatively small amount of original finds. For many years the Piltdown\n\nfinds were a significant percentage of the fossils which were used to reconstruct human ancestry.\n\nIt is a black mark on science that it took 40 years to expose a hoax that bore directly on human ancestry.\n\nCreationists have not been slow in pointing to the hoax, the erroneous reconstructions based on the hoax,\n\nand the long time it took to expose the hoax.\n\nBack to myths and misconceptions\n\n[Intro] [History] [How?] [Exposure] [Who?] [Myths] [People] [References] [Web Sites]\n\n[Abbot] [Barlow] [Butterfield] [Dawson] [Doyle] [Edmonds] [Gould] [Hinton] [Hargreaves] [Keith] [Smith]\n\n[Matthews] [Teilhard] [Weiner] [Woodward]\n\nWho the players were\n\nLewis Abbot was a jeweler in Hastings. He knew Dawson since 1900 through the Hastings museum. He\n\nwas an authority on Wealdan flora and fauna and its ancient gravels and, more generally, the geology of\n\nsouthern England. Weiner described him as \"fiery, bombastic, inspiring and weird.\"\n\nFrank O. Barlow was a staff member of the British Museum of Natural History. He prepared plaster casts\n\nof the Piltdown skull.\n\nWilliam Butterfield was the curator at the Hastings museum. Ordinarily of calm and placid temperament,\n\nhe quarreled with Dawson over Dawson's appropriation of some dinosaur fossils for the British Museum.\n\nRaymond Dart held the chair of Anatomy in the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. He\n\ndiscovered Australopithecus (Taung baby) and was the principal early exponent of an African origin for\n\nhumanity.\n\nCharles Dawson was an amateur archaeologist, geologist, antiquarian, and was a collector of fossils for\n\nthe British museum. He was the original person to seriously search for fossils in the Piltdown quarry. In\n\n1912 he and Woodward discovered the the first Piltdown skull. In 1915 he discovered the second skull. He\n\ndied in 1916 shortly after the finds.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle was a neighbor of Dawson's and had an interest in paleontology. At one point he\n\nparticipated in the Piltdown digs. He was the victim of the \"fairies in the garden\" hoax. Doyle wrote The\n\nLost World and a number of popular mysteries.\n\nF. H. Edmonds was a British geologist in the Geological Survey. His papers in 1925 and 1951 cast doubt\n\nrespectively on the assigned age of Piltdown man and on there being a plausible source for Piltdown animal\n\nfossils.\n\nStephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist at Harvard University. Gould and Niles Eldredge introduced the\n\n\"punctuated equilibrium\" theory. Gould is the author of a number of popular collections of essays. He has\n\nsuggested that Teilhard de Chardin was the author of the hoax.\n\nVenus Hargreaves was the workman who assisted Dawson, Woodward, and Teilhard deChardin in the\n\nPiltdown digs.\n\nMartin A. C. Hinton was a member of the Sussex circle of paleontologists before the hoax and a curator\n\nof zoology at the British Museum at the time of the fraud.

The remains became known as\n\nPiltdown Man.\n\nIn 1953, the Piltdown skull was declared a hoax. When the bones were subjected to fluorine analysis,\n\nthey found that the cranium material contained less fluorine than did the bones of other extinct animals\n\nfound with it, and that the mandible was that of a modern orangutan. The culprit who had masterminded\n\nthe hoax had filed down the canine teeth, and had stained the bones to make them appear to be of the\n\nsame age as known prehistoric animals. These diverse fragments were then secretly placed in the sites.\n\nWho perpetrated this dastardly deed? Over the years several persons have been named including Arthur\n\nConan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, who lived near Piltdown Common and was a known\n\nantievolutionist.\n\nThis past May, Professor Brian Gardiner of King's College, London, announced to the Linnean Society\n\nthat the perpetrator has been finally unmasked. It was Martin A. C. Hinton, a curator of zoology at the\n\nNatural History Museum in London, who specialized in the study of fossil rodents.\n\nA canvas travelling trunk belonging to Mr. Hinton was discovered in the southwest tower of the\n\nmuseum. Inside were several bones and teeth, all carved and stained in the same manner as the bones\n\nplaced in the Piltdown site. Professor Gardiner believes that Mr. Hinton, a well-known practical joker,\n\ncreated the hoax to embarrass Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the museum, as revenge\n\nover a pay issue.\n\nHowever, as is all too common in anthropological circles, not everyone totally agrees. The\n\nannouncement by Gardiner has brought forward new commentary (see Sources). The definitive\n\nsolution of the mystery may be yet to come.\n\n____________________\n\nSources: H.

Located in the region of Bahr el Ghazal near Koro Toro in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti\n\nProvince of northern Chad, this specimen extends the range of the australopithecines 2500 kilometers\n\n(1550 miles) to the east of the previously-known range. The find is associated with other animal fossils\n\nthat have been dated between 3.5 and 3.0 million years old. The fossil, KT 12/H1, is a fragment of an\n\nadult mandible, and it includes the crowns of several teeth.1\n\nAt the time of the announcement, paleoanthropologists had not as yet decided whether these differences\n\nrepresent a geographical variant of Australopithecus afarensis, or represent a new australopithecine\n\nspecies. Last May, Michel Brunet, who discovered the new fossil, announced that further analyses has led\n\nhim and his colleagues to place the specimen into a new australopithecine species Australopithecus\n\nbahrelghazalia.2\n\n____________________\n\n1 M.

However, there is no agreement among paleoanthropologists as to the real relationship between\n\nthe two populations. If they were indeed contemporary, some scholars see a very rapid replacement of\n\nthe Neandertals by modern humans, while others see a more gradual replacement over a period of time.\n\nIf the latter view is correct, we can then speculate about the nature of Neandertal-modern relationships.\n\nThe answer to these problems may lie in layer Xb of the French site of Arcy-sur-Cure which has been\n\ndated by radiocarbon dating to 33,820 Â± 0.720 B.P. This layer contains a bone and ivory industry which\n\nincludes a number of personal ornaments that belong to the early Upper Paleolithic industry called the\n\nChÃ¢telperronian. The ChÃ¢telperronian, found in northern Spain and central and southwestern France,\n\nincludes an Upper Paleolithic blade technology associated with a developed Middle Paleolithic bone\n\nindustry.\n\nLayer Xb at Arcy-sur-Cure has also yielded a hominid temporal bone fragment from a one-year-old\n\ninfant. High-resolution computed tomography has been used to visualize the bony labyrinth of the inner\n\near within this temporal bone, as well as to visualize the bony labyrinth of specimens of H. erectus and\n\nanatomically modern H. sapiens. Although the specimen is that of an infant, the structure of this part of\n\nthe anatomy is established in the fetus, and it can be reliably compared with other adult specimens.\n\nThe Neandertal bony labyrinth consists of anterior and posterior semicircular canals that are smaller\n\nthan those of both earlier H. erectus and later H. sapiens. The posterior canal also lies in a distinctive\n\nrelative position. Based on this analysis, the temporal bone fragment found at Arcy-sur-Cure, which is\n\ndated at around 34,000 B.P., belongs to a Neandertal; it is one of the youngest known Neandertal\n\nspecimens.\n\nThis evidence implies that the Neandertals and anatomically modern H. sapiens coexisted over a\n\nsignificant period of time. The presence of Upper Paleolithic artifacts in association with Neandertals\n\nsuggest several possibilities about their relationships, such as diffusion of Upper Paleolithic technology\n\nto Neandertal populations, or what is more likely, some type of trade. However, evidence also confirms\n\nthe idea that the two populations remained reproductively isolated during this period.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: J. Hublin, F. Spoor, M. Braun, F.

In people who do not vigorously exercise with one arm, the asymmetry is\n\nonly about 5 percent. Bone thickness, as well as the internal structure of bone, is affected by use.\n\nCalculations of the amount and distribution of bone in a cross-section of bone leads to an estimation of\n\nthe weight that bone can bare.\n\nRecent research has been concluded on the arms and legs of the Neandertals. The investigators concluded\n\nthat when corrected for body size and proportions, Neandertal legs were no more robust than those of\n\nmodern humans--yet their upper arms were significantly more robust. Their greater arm strength may\n\nnot have been advantageous according to Neandertal specialist Erik Trinkaus. Indeed, the increased\n\nstrength may be symptomatic of inefficient behavior.\n\nTrinkaus believes that Neandertals and modern humans who lived in the same habitats and had similar\n\ntools had different behavioral patterns. These different patterns led to different functions of their upper\n\nbodies. He argues that Neandertals worked harder to process food because they chose food that was\n\nharder to process; they also may not have used their tools efficiently. Other evidence seems to support\n\nthis conclusion. Neandertals exhibit more wear on their front teeth than modern peoples. This suggests\n\nthat they used their teeth as vices to hold objects rather than using tools.\n\nTrinkaus goes on to say that differences in the development of the Neandertal and modern human pelvis\n\nindicate differences in social patterns. The femoral neck, which articulates with the pelvis, shows\n\nsignificant differences which might reflect patterns of use. The femoral neck is vertical to the shaft of\n\nthe femur at birth. The more active a child, the more the femoral neck bends inward and downward\n\nwith increasing age. The shape of the Neandertal femur suggests that Neandertal children were more\n\nactive than early modern children. Nean dertal children may have had to follow adults around as the\n\nadults foraged for food.\n\nIn this scenario, early modern human children remained at a home base, and they were cared for by\n\nadults who were not involved in foraging for food. This behavior may have lowered infant and child\n\nmortality. Trinkaus suggests that the inefficient use of tools and the physical demands on children may\n\nhave been reasons for that the Neandertals lost out to modern humans. Of course, not all\n\npaleoanthropologists agree with Trinkaus' hypotheses.\n\nReference: Gibbons, A., \"Did Neandertals Lose an Evolutionary 'Arms' Race?\" Science, 272 (14 June\n\n1996), 1586-1587.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nNEANDERTALS SEE THE LIGHT\n\nSee Physical Anthropology, 6th edition, Chapter 18, pages 483-484; Physical\n\nAnthropology: The Core, Chapter 11, pages 290.\n\nH umans are not by nature cave-dwelling animals, as caves are dark, often damp, and quite\n\nuncomfortable. Prehistoric peoples did inhabit the mouths of caves, but rarely did they venture into their\n\ndeep interiors. In fact, what are often called \"caves\" are not caves at all, but rock shelters or rock\n\noverhangs.\n\nAn important exception was recently reported. A cave at Bruniquel, located in southern France, has\n\nyielded the first evidence of Neandertals using the deep interior of a cave. The site is dated to at least\n\n47,600 years ago; this was a time when the only hominids living in Europe were Neandertals. A complex\n\nquadrilateral structure has been found hundreds of meters from the cave entrance, but archaeologists are\n\nnot sure what this structure is. Burnt bones of a cave bear indicate that humans were present in the cave.\n\nUntil this find came to light, it was generally thought that the earliest use of deep interiors of caves was\n\nthe result of the activities of totally modern people which started about 30,000 years ago with the\n\npainting of pictures on cave walls. Also, if Neandertals were constructing complex geometric structures\n\nand making portable light sources, they may have had abilities for precise and complex communication.\n\nThis bolsters the idea that Neandertals had linguistic and social organizational abilities similar to those of\n\nmodern peoples.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: M.

Members of this family date from the middle Eocene. The only species of\n\neosimiid described at that time was Eosimias sinensis. The hypothesis that E. sinensis was an early\n\nanthropoid was strongly criticized by many paleontologists; some even doubted that the fossil was a\n\nprimate.\n\nIn May 1995, a new eosimiid species was found. This new species is Eosimias centennicus from the\n\nEocene of southern Shanxi Province, China. The new fossils are important because they include evidence\n\nof the entire dentition. Like the earlier discovery, E. centennicus was very small; it probably weighed\n\nbetween 91 and 179 grams (3.2 and 6.3 ounces) or about the size of a modern pygmy marmoset.\n\nAnalysis of the teeth suggests that the diet consisted of fruits with some insects.\n\nDetailed analysis of the dentition confirm that the eosimiids are indeed very early anthropoids. The\n\nauthors suggest that the eosimiids are a group of primates distinct from the Adapids, Omomyids, and\n\nTarsiiforms. The evidence also supports the idea that since the anthropoids were well established by the\n\nmiddle Eocene, their origins must lie further back in time.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: K. C.

The fossil skull presents evidence of facial, mandibular,\n\nand dental features that include a relatively narrow interorbital region, moderately developed brow\n\nridges, square orbits, and robust mandible. Postcranial bones have also been found but have not yet been\n\ndescribed.\n\nThe skull has be placed into the species Ankarapithecus meteai. This species was previously represented\n\nby a mandible and a lower face. The new skull (AS95-500) is believed to be an adult female while the\n\nearlier material is through to be male.\n\nThe age of the skull is thought to be around 9.8 million B.P. based upon the geomagnetic reversal time\n\nscale. The material is contemporary with other Miocene hominoids including Ouranopithecus\n\nmacedoniensis, Dryo- pithecus laietanus, and Sivapithecus.

The earliest reliably dated Paleoindian sites are those of the Clovis culture\n\nwhich dates about 11,200 to 10,900 B.P. These early peoples of the North American plains are seen as\n\nbig-game hunters who used specialized fluted stone spear points. From this center, people moved down\n\nthe Andes Mountains of South America.\n\nGenerally, the great tropical forests of South America are seen as uninhabitable until the advent of\n\nhorticulture. The presence of triangular points in the Amazon basin suggest that the tropical forest was\n\noccupied at an early date, but the lack of a stratified site and good radiometric dating has made it\n\ndifficult to reach any firm conclusions.\n\nRecently, archaeologists located stratified Paleoindian deposits in association with a painted sandstone\n\ncave at Caverna da Pedra Pintada in the state of Monte Alegre, Brazil. From the Paleoindian strata, they\n\nrecovered 24 tools and over 30,000 flakes which represent tool-making activity. The tools included\n\ntriangular, stemmed bifacial points. The presence of red pigment that was chemically identical to the\n\npigment used in the rock paintings strongly suggests that the paintings date from the Paleoindian period.\n\nThousands of carbonized fruits and wood fragments were also found. These provide evidence as to the\n\nfood resources of the occupants of the site. One familiar food resource is the Brazil nut. Remains of\n\nbone and shell testify to a diverse diet obtained from animal sources.\n\nBoth conventional and the accelerator mass spectrometry method of radiocarbon dating was used to date\n\nmany plant samples. The authors estimate that the site was first occupied from about 11,200 to 10,500\n\nB.P.\n\nThe archaeologists conclude that Paleoindians occupied the South American rain forest contemporary\n\nwith the Paleoindian occupation of the North American plains. This suggests that the migrations of the\n\nearly migrants to the New World were more complex than has been assumed. It also suggests the\n\npossibility of several waves of migrations. Finally, the evidence also demonstrates the ability of\n\nprehorticultural peoples to survive in tropical rain forest habitats.\n\nSource: A. C.

During the times when large Pleistocene glaciers developed on\n\nland, the level of the ocean dropped sufficiently to expose a large expanse of land connecting the two\n\ncontinents; this land is covered today by the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Paleobotanical data,\n\ncombined with the remains of insects, have been recovered from 20 cores taken from the floor of these\n\nseas.\n\nAnalysis of the data suggests that what is now ocean floor was dry land as recently as 11,000 years ago,\n\nand that the summer temperatures were warmer than they are today. It appears that the land at that time\n\nwas a tundra which is similar to that found in Arctic Alaska today. Although animal resources were\n\navailable for food, it was a harsh and difficult landscape.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: S. A.

The best-known is perhaps the\n\n\"Mitochondrial Eve\" hypothesis. A new study of a section of chromosome 12 appears to agree with\n\nprevious genetic studies; it suggests that modern humans evolved between 200,000 and 120,000 years\n\nago and then migrated out of Africa.\n\nA segment of chromosome 12 known as the Alu deletion, has numerous variations in Africa; the\n\nnumber of variations decreases from sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa. The assumption is that the\n\ngreater the number of variations there are for a genetic character, the older that character must be. The\n\nrelative lack of variation in Europe indicates that a small population from Africa moved into Europe\n\nrelatively recently, about 100,000 years ago.\n\nAs with other studies of human ancestry based on comparative genetics, the time estimates are based on\n\nassumed mutation rates. And as with other studies, there are researchers who are not convinced by the\n\ninterpretations of the data. Although the information seems to best conform to the replacement model of\n\nmodern human origins, some paleoanthropologists state that the information is not inconsistent with the\n\nregional continuity model. Small local populations could lose variation through genetic drift over time,\n\nor they may never have been characterized by variation in some traits.\n\n_____________________\n\nSource: Tishkoff, S.

Traditionally, taxonomists classify organisms on the basis of anatomical and physiological\n\nsimilarities. Many of these similarities are established through subjective observation, and the\n\nsignificance of certain features may vary from one scholar to the next. Today comparative studies on the\n\nmolecular level are producing new insights into the evolutionary history of major categories of life.\n\nIn early 1996, two studies were published that dealt with the relationships among living organisms. We\n\nknow that life in the form of simple cells was established by at least 3.5 billion years ago. However, the\n\nfossil record of early unicellular forms of life is very poor. When did the major forms of life first\n\nappear?\n\nRussell F. Doolittle and his colleagues attempted to shed light on this issue by using a \"molecular\n\nclock.\"1 This \"clock\" is based upon the rate at which proteins change over time. The investigators\n\nutilized the amino acid sequences from 57 different enzymes which are proteins; within these proteins\n\nthey used 531 different amino acid sequences. Although many assumptions were made, they suggest that\n\nmodern eukaryotes and bacteria share a common ancestor at around 2 billion years ago, and that the\n\ndivergence of plants and animals took place about 1 billion years ago.\n\n________________________\n\n1 R.

This mammalian adaptive radiation was made\n\npossible in part by the vacancies in ecological niches that followed the demise of the dinosaurs. Now\n\nthere is evidence that one group of mammal, the ungulates, began to diversify 85 million or more years\n\nago.\n\nThe superorder Ungulata includes several living and extinct orders of mammals including animals as\n\ndiverse as the elephants, whales, and deer. Fossils discovered in Uzbekistan, part of the former Soviet\n\nUnion, and dated at 85 million B.P., may represent early ungulate ancestors. Although a major\n\nmammalian adaptive radiation occurred after the extinction of the dinosaurs, a smaller radiation had\n\ntaken place much earlier.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: Archibald, D.

The diagram shows a close relationship between the\n\norder Lagomorpha (rabbits and hares) and the Rodentia (squirrels, beavers, mice and porcupines). This\n\nis the traditional view of biologists.\n\nBased upon anatomical and fossil evidence, the Lagomorpha and Rodentia are usually classified together\n\ninto the superorder Glires. The superorder Glires is thought to have emerged during the very rapid\n\nmammalian adaptive radiation that occurred in the early Paleocene. Close by on the evolutionary tree is\n\nthe closely related suborder Archontia that includes the primates along with tree shrews, flying lemurs,\n\nand bats.\n\nThe classification of the lagomorphs has an interesting history. The Old Testament places them with the\n\nruminants, the cud-chewing hoofed mammals. While Linnaeus placed them as a family with the order\n\nRodentia, he stressed the very close relationship that he saw between the two groups. Now a recent\n\nstudy, based upon the analysis of protein sequences, says that all of this is untrue.1 In fact, not only are\n\nthe rodents and lagomorphs not closely related enough to belong in a single suborder, the lagomorphs\n\nare actually closer to the primates than they are to the rodents.\n\nOf course, the new study is not conclusive, and the correct picture will not emerge for some time. The\n\nmost important consequence of the new data will be to stimulate new studies on the evolutionary\n\nrelationships among mammalian groups both on the molecular and anatomical level.\n\n____________________\n\n1 D.

Linnaeus based his classification on the physical resemblances among organisms, and\n\nnot on evolutionary relationships.\n\nRecently, the concept of cladistics is being used to emphasize different levels of evolutionary\n\nrelationships among organisms. However, cladistics is not a classification system per se, nor does it offer\n\na systematic way of naming organisms.\n\nNow, several biologists are proposing a different way of classifying organisms based strictly on\n\nproposed common ancestors. For example, in the Linnaean classification, reptiles and birds are placed\n\ninto separate classes, but phylogenetic studies indicate that birds should be included within the reptiles.\n\nThe proponents of the new system say that the Linnaean system often leads people to assume\n\nevolutionary relationships that do not exist, and that they miss evolutionary relationships that do exist.\n\nSource: E.

A pottery jar has\n\nbeen recovered from the site of Hajji Firuz Tepe, a Neolithic village in the northern Zagros Mountains\n\nof Iran. The jar was manufactured between 5400 and 5000 B.C.\n\nThe archaeologists found a yellowish residue inside the vessel. Chemical analysis determined that the\n\nresidue consisted of the calcium salt of tartaric acid and the yellowish resin of the terebinth tree which\n\nwas used in antiquity. A similar residue has been found in Egyptian jars that are associated with written\n\nrecords identifying them as containing wine.\n\nTartaric acid occurs in large amounts in grapes. Terebinth resin is soluble in alcohol, and it was added to\n\ninhibit the growth of bacteria that concert wine into vinegar; it also masks any foul taste or odor.\n\nThe site exists in an area that, in ancient times, supported both wild grape and later early domesticated\n\ngrape. Terebinth trees also grow through the region.\n\nThe site of Hajji Firuz Tepe was a very early Neolithic settlement. There was evidence of domesticated\n\nplants and animals, and the development of many crafts including the manufacturing of pottery. The jar\n\nwas found in the kitchen area of a building made of mud bricks.\n\n____________________\n\nSource: P. E.

By the time Jack was 10\n\nhe looked like a man of 40. Although it differs from the situation in the movie in many ways, an\n\nabnormality that causes premature aging does actually exist.\n\nWermer's syndrome is characterized by premature aging. Unlike Jack, the rapid aging does not become\n\napparent until the person is in his or her twenties. At this time, several features normally found in older\n\npeople appear. These features include heart disease and cancers, grey hair, wrinkled skin, cataracts, and\n\nother characteristics associated with older age.\n\nIn April 1996, researchers announced the discovery of the gene that causes Wermer's syndrome. It is a\n\nmutation that interferes with the proper repair and replication of DNA along with other regulatory\n\neffects on the proper action of DNA. Although geneticists estimate that about 70 percent of human genes\n\ncan affect aging in some way, they hope that knowledge gained from research on the gene responsible\n\nfor Wermer's syndrome might ultimately lead to the development of methods to slow down aging, cure\n\ncancer, and cure Werner's syndrome.\n\n____________________\n\nSources: Ellis, N., \"Mutation Causing Mutations,\" Nature, 381 (May 9, 1996), 110-111; Jazwinski, M.\n\nS., \"Longevity, Genes, and Aging,\" Science, 273 (5 July 1996), 54-59; Pennisi, E., "
