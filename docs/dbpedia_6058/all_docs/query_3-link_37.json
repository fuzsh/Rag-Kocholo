        "text": "Brandon Sklenar is trading in the rigors of ranch life for some love-triangle drama.\n\nSklenar, who stars as Spencer Dutton on the Western drama “1923,” has been cast in the romance drama “It Ends With Us,” a film adaptation of the Colleen Hoover novel of the same name. Hoover confirmed Sklenar will be playing the character Atlas, opposite stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, in an Instagram post Thursday.\n\n“They announced Atlas!” Hoover wrote. “Cannot wait for this. Loving the cast so far. Feels like a dream.”\n\nSklenar’s co-star Baldoni also celebrated the casting news on social media. “Ladies and gentlemen&mldr; meet your #Atlas,” he wrote on Instagram.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Sklenar and the film.\n\nWho is 'It Ends With Us' star Brandon Sklenar?\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Sklenar made his acting debut in the 2011 crime mystery “Cornered.” He went on to hone his silver-screen chops with appearances in 2018’s “Mapplethorpe” and “Vice,” as well as the 2022 crime thriller “Emily the Criminal.”\n\nBut Sklenar’s breakout role came when he was cast as for-hire hunter Spencer Dutton in the TV series “1923,” a prequel to the western drama “Yellowstone.”\n\n“He's kind of driven by trauma,” Sklenar told USA TODAY of his character in January. “He saw his murdered father die in front of him. His mother froze to death. Childhood trauma definitely influenced his decision to go fight in the war, where he killed dozens. Trauma is all he's known, pretty much.”\n\n'1923's Spencer Dutton speaks:Brandon Sklenar on working under a lion, new TV love and 'mission'\n\nSpencer Dutton's '1923' finale:Brandon Sklenar on that surprise dueling death, nervous waltzing\n\nWhat is ‘It Ends With Us’ about?\n\n“It Ends With Us” is a page-to-screen adaptation of Hoover’s bestselling 2016 novel. The novel chronicles the complicated love life of a woman named Lily, whose relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid is tested when Atlas Corrigan – Lily’s first love – reenters her life.\n\nAside from Sklenar, the film, which is currently in pre-production according to IMDb, will also feature performances by \"Gossip Girl\" star Lively and \"Jane the Virgin\" actor Baldoni. Lively and Baldoni will play Lily and Ryle, respectively, Hoover announced in January, adding the actors \"have what it takes to bring these characters to life.\"\n\n\"Blake Lively, y'all! She's my dream Lily,\" Hoover shared in an Instagram video. \"Then when I first met Justin Baldoni, who is directing the film for 'It Ends With Us,' I immediately wanted him to be Ryle. &mldr; So we have our Ryle and our Lily.\"\n\nBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni cast in 'It Ends with Us' movie,Colleen Hoover reveals\n\nWho is Colleen Hoover?\n\nHoover, 43, lives in a small town in east Texas just outside Sulphur Springs. She worked for several years as a social worker before becoming a counselor at WIC, a nutrition program for women, children and infants. She self-published her debut novel, \"Slammed,\" in 2012. In total, she has written 22 novels and three novellas, and contributed to two anthologies.\n\nHoover's books fall into new adult and young adult genres. While the author explores a range of genres in her work, many of Hoover's plot lines involve emotionally intense situations including sexual assault, surviving trauma, infertility and abusive relationships.\n\nHoover's popularity has exploded in recent years. Her sales surge can be attributed in part to her massive popularity on TikTok, particularly in the platform's #booktok subculture.\n\n'It Ends with Us' author Colleen Hooveris the queen of best sellers. Why is she so popular?\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, Amy Haneline and Mary Cadden, USA TODAY"
