        "text": "Lily Tomlin (born September 1, 1939, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.) is an American comedian, writer, and actress who first found success on the television show Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In—where she created a number of memorable characters—and later embarked on a notable film career that highlighted her adeptness at both comedic and serious roles.\n\nTomlin, who grew up in Detroit, attended Wayne State University. She began performing stand-up comedy in local clubs and eventually moved to New York City. In 1966–67 she appeared on the television series The Garry Moore Show, and in 1970–73 she was a regular on Laugh-In, a popular comedy and variety program. There she introduced a number of characters—notably Ernestine, a rude telephone operator, and Edith Ann, a precocious five-year-old—that made her a household name. Ernestine was later featured on Tomlin’s album This Is a Recording (1971), which earned the comedian a Grammy Award, and several characters appeared in the Emmy Award-winning TV movie Lily (1973).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1975 Tomlin made her film debut in Robert Altman’s Nashville, a critically acclaimed ensemble drama. For her portrayal of an unhappily married gospel singer, Tomlin received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. She also earned accolades for her follow-up movie, Robert Benton’s The Late Show (1977), in which she portrayed a woman who hires an aging private investigator (played by Art Carney) to find her cat. Tomlin’s success continued as she moved to Broadway, where she starred in the one-woman show Appearing Nitely (1977), which earned her a special Tony Award. She cowrote and codirected the program with Jane Wagner, who was Tomlin’s longtime collaborator and companion; the couple married in 2013.\n\nIn 1978 Tomlin returned to the big screen with Moment by Moment, in which she portrayed a wealthy woman who has an affair with a young hustler (John Travolta); the drama was written and directed by Wagner. It was widely panned. Tomlin rebounded with Nine to Five (1980), a hugely popular comedy about coworkers (Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton) who decide to kill their sexist boss (Dabney Coleman). A series of comedies followed, though they were less successful. During that time Tomlin also starred in the one-woman Broadway show The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe (1985–86), for which she received a Tony for best actress. The 1991 film adaptation, however, was largely ignored.\n\nIn 1993 Tomlin reteamed with Altman for the critically acclaimed Short Cuts. The ensemble drama was based on nine short stories by Raymond Carver, and Tomlin portrayed a waitress who fatally hits a boy with her car. Also well received was David O. Russell’s comedy Flirting with Disaster (1996), in which she played a hippie reunited with the son (Ben Stiller) she gave up for adoption. Among her later notable films were Tea with Mussolini (1999), which featured an all-star cast that included Cher, Judi Dench, and Maggie Smith; Russell’s I Heart Huckabees (2004), in which Tomlin played an existential detective; and A Prairie Home Companion (2006), Altman’s adaptation of Garrison Keillor’s radio series. In Grandma (2015) Tomlin deployed her trademark acidity as the supportive but no-nonsense grandmother of a pregnant teenager.\n\nIn addition to her film and stage work, Tomlin continued to act on television. She had recurring roles on such shows as Murphy Brown, Will & Grace, The West Wing, Desperate Housewives, Damages, Eastbound & Down, and Web Therapy. From 2015 to 2022 she starred opposite Fonda in the farcical Grace and Frankie, a Netflix streaming series about two women whose husbands leave them for each other. Tomlin and Fonda also appeared—alongside Sally Field and Rita Moreno—in the comedy 80 for Brady, about a group of friends whose love for the New England Patriots and star quarterback Tom Brady leads to a raucous Super Bowl weekend."
