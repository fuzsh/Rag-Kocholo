She was like, ‘Ashley, what is going on?’ And I replied, ‘Nothing. I told you I wasn’t dating actors.'\n\nHowever, she revealed that things took a turn on their volunteer trip to Poland, recalling, \"watching him play chess with these children who did not have a home and acting like this father figure to them because their fathers were at war, watching him be so present, it was amazing.\"\n\nThis experience made her realize her feelings for him, prompting her to finally acknowledge their connection.\n\nPark praised him for his generosity and kindness, both as a coworker and a partner.\n\nShe said, \"One of the reasons I wanted to be friends with him, and eventually fell in love with him, is that he’s so generous and kind as a coworker and a friend.\""
