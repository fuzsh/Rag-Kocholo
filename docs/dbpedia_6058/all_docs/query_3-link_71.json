        "text": "Dylan O'Brien And Lamorne Morris Completely Transform In The First Trailer For The Upcoming Movie About The Early Days Of \"SNL\"\n\nThe film depicts the frenzied early days of Saturday Night Live and features a seriously star-studded cast.\n\nThe latest film from director Jason Reitman (Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Juno) is set in the early days of Saturday Night Live, and the trailer just dropped today.\n\nThe film is aptly titled Saturday Night. It chronicles series creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels as he assembles and (attempts to) corral a rag-tag crew of young comedians starring on a live late-night NBC sketch comedy show. The Fablemans' star Gabriel LaBelle plays Michaels.\n\nSo many recognizable actors appear in the film, which is set in 1975. They're mostly playing SNL's original cast members, the team behind the show, or their spouses or partners: Dylan O'Brien, May December's Cory Michael Smith, Dickinson's Ella Hunt, Lamorne Morris, Rachel Sennott, Cooper Hoffman, Kaia Gerber, Nicholas Braun, Willem Dafoe, No Hard Feelings' Andrew Barth Feldman, Finn Wolfhard, Jon Batiste, J.K. Simmons...the list goes on.\n\nMany are nearly unrecognizable in costume, including O'Brien as cast member Dan Aykroyd.\n\nSame for Lamorne Morris as fellow cast member Garrett Morris...\n\n...and Ella Hunt as the iconic Gilda Radner among others.\n\nSo watch the full trailer below:\n\nSaturday Night will be released in theaters on Oct. 11.\n\nShare This Article"
