        "text": "Previews for Emily in Paris have left many of us saying \"oh là là.\" From the beautiful Parisian backdrops to the stunning French street style, the Netflix show looks—as the French say—très magnifique. Not the mention, the Netflix series, created by Darren Star—yes, the man behind Sex and the City, Younger, and Melrose Place—features an insanely talented and stunning cast. Come for American stars like Lily Collins and Kate Walsh and stay for Parisian up-and-comers like Lucas Bravo and Camille Razat who will surely have you thinking \"oh mon dieu.\" Find out who's who in the Emily in Paris cast before the rom-com hits the streaming giant on October 2. (Just make sure you've stocked up on champagne, macarons, and croissants before hitting play.)\n\n1. Lily Collins as Emily Cooper\n\nLily Collins stars as the titular character in the Netflix series. And much like her character, Emily, she's one of the few Americans in the mostly Parisian cast. Collins is known for Mirror, Mirror; Love, Rosie; and To the Bone—and, of course, for her famous parents, musician Phil Collins and actress Jill Tavelman.\n\n2. Lucas Bravo as Gabriel\n\nIn the Netflix show, Lucas Bravo plays Gabriel, a talented chef and Emily's dashing downstairs neighbor. In real life, Bravo is an up-and-coming French actor with several film shorts to his name, including Caprice and Beautiful injuries.\n\n3. Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu as Sylvie\n\nPhilippine Leroy-Beaulieu plays Sylvie, Emily's tough-as-nails boss. The actress has been working since the early '80s and is known for French titles like Three Men And A Cradle and Natalia.\n\n4. Kate Walsh as Madeline\n\nShondaland fans will have no trouble identifying Kate Walsh. The Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice star plays Madeline, Emily's American mentor. Walsh is also known for her roles in The Drew Carey Show, Umbrella Academy, and 13 Reasons Why.\n\n5. Ashley Park as Mindy Chen\n\nIn the show, Ashley Park plays Mindy Chen, Emily's Parisian BFF and city guide. The Grammy- and Tony-nominated actress is mainly known for her work on Broadway, from playing Gretchen Wieners in the musical Mean Girls to starring in Sunday in the Park With George and The King and I.\n\n6. Camille Razat as Camille\n\nFrench actress and model Camille Razat stars in the Netflix show as Emily's sweet friend, Camille. Razat has previously starred as Lea Morel in the French mini-series The Disappearance and as Lise in the French/Belgian horror film Girls with Balls.\n\n7.

The French A-lister, who plays one of the flirtatious clients at Emily's marketing firm, has also worked in film, appearing in titles like Resident Evil and The Pink Panther.\n\n8. Samuel Arnold as Julien\n\nWho doesn't love a good work frenemy? Samuel Arnold stars as Julien, Emily's coworker who (usually) does his best at showing the her the ropes at their marketing firm. This is the French actor's first big show, having only appeared previously in a few made-for-TV-movies and theater productions.\n\n9. Bruno Gouery as Luc\n\nBruno Gouery plays Luc, another one of Emily's sometimes friendly, sometimes savage, coworkers. Gouery is a French actor and writer known for several French series, including Doc Martin, President Alphonse, and Super Jimmy.\n\n10. Jean-Christophe Bouvet as Pierre Cadault\n\nYou might recognize Jean-Christophe Bouvet—who plays fashion designer Pierre Cadault in the Netflix series—from his role in 2006's Marie Antoinette. The actor's also been in several French works including 1977's La machine.\n\n11. Charles Martins as Mathieu Cadault\n\nCharles Martins is no stranger to the Darren Star universe. The actor previously had an uncredited role in Star's Sex and the City, as well as a recurring part in the TV series Versailles. In Emily in Paris, he stars as Mathieu Cadault, a buzzed-about bachelor who is heir to a fashion empire."
