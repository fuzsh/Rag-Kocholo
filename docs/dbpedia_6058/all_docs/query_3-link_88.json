        "text": "It’s that time of year where television that we have been waiting for starts to premiere. One show that we have been waiting anxiously for is thee new season of Emily in Paris.\n\nWhile we wait for the show to premiere, we are going to sit back and enjoy all of the press that the cast is set to do. We love the insights that they give into their lives and into the show.\n\nLast year, we learned of Ashley Park and Paul Forman’s relationship and now, thanks to Ashley talking to Cosmopolitan we are learning more. The actress talked about how she wasn’t looking to date him (or any actor), but attraction and chemistry a funny thing.\n\nAt least in our opinion.\n\nAshley said, “In the beginning, we were just friends, because I was at a point where I was like, ‘I will never date an actor again. And one of the first things he said to me was, ‘I’ve never dated an actor.’ And I was like, ‘Amazing.’”\n\nBack to attraction and chemistry – even if you are trying to deny that it’s there – it is still there. The actress continued by telling Cosmopolitan one of the first people to notice the attraction? Her BFF and co-star Lily Collins.\n\n“Lily noticed the chemistry. She was like, ‘Ashley, what is going on?’ And I replied, ‘Nothing. I told you I wasn’t dating actors.’ It was the first time I was really standing up for myself,” Ashley said.\n\nShe continued, “” told her, ‘Lily, your disbelief in my growth is sad, because he’s the exact type of guy that I said I wasn’t going to go for. I told you, and so I really want you, as my friend, to believe me.’ …So I had to do a little loss-of-dignity tour. I had to be like, ‘Lily, everyone, we are so in love.’ That was about two years ago.”\n\nWe love that Ashley stood up for herself, but in the same breathe we will also say that we learned a long time ago when our friends call us out it is for a reason. They want us to see what is right in front of us, but what we’re also doing everything that we can to deny.\n\nAshley and Paul are adorable together and we did learn last year when she got sick that the man will be there for her unconditionally and we LOVE that. We love the relationship part that they show us all because you can see their pure love and joy.\n\nIf there is one thing we’ve learned in life is that everyone deserves that."
