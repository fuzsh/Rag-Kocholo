        "text": "Lily Baldwin is a queer filmmaker known for combining her deep love of dance and film to craft visceral stories with dreamscapes and stylized documentary. Focusing on hybrid forms, she blurs supernatural, action, and thriller genres. Recent experiences living with disability give her a unique inside-out lens; she bridges disabled and able-bodied perspectives. Her works have been screened at festivals including Sundance, SXSW, Berlinale, and the Venice Biennale, as well as exhibited around the world at galleries and museums. She choreographed the music video ‘Sutphin Boulevard’ by Blood Orange / Dev Hynes and the opening event at Times Square with Arto Lindsay for ‘Performa 09’. Baldwin performed on the world tour of David Byrne and Brian Eno’s album EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WILL HAPPEN TODAY, with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet.\n\nLily co-created and performed in ‘TERRAIN: A Docu-Dream’ an expanded cinema installation bringing together dance, documentary, 360-degree immersive video, virtual interactivity, and spatial design. Baldwin also co-directed ‘THROUGH YOU’, an award-winning VR installation in which The New York Times noted “Movement and gesture take possession of the viewer in a way that has never been replicated.”\n\nIndependent Magazine names her as one of “10 Filmmakers to Watch” and The New York Times says her “work has a visceral power similar to Cronenberg’s.”"
