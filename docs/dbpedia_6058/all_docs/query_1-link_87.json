        "text": "Credit: Gotham/GC Images\n\nBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni's 'It Ends With Us' Movie Adaptation: Everything to Know So Far\n\nColleen Hoover‚Äôs 2016 bestselling novel It Ends With Us is officially being adapted for the big screen ‚Äì with Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni taking center stage. Released in 2016, It Ends With Us became a social media cultural phenomenon and was the top-selling print book of 2022. The novel remained on The New York Times bestseller list for over 90 weeks. The story follows a girl named Lily who falls for a doctor named Ryle ‚Äî who swears by the ‚Äúno girlfriends‚Äù rule ‚Äî after college. Just as things turn serious (and dangerous), Lily‚Äôs first love, Atlas, reappears in her life and challenges her new relationship. The novel was optioned in 2019 by Baldoni ‚Äî who will direct and star as Ryle ‚Äî and Wayfarer Studios, with Hoover working as a consultant and Chirsty Hall penning the script. Hoover announced via Instagram in January 2023 that Lively had been cast as the film‚Äôs leading lady, calling the actress her ‚Äúdream Lily.‚Äù Keeping scrolling for everything to know about the It Ends With Us movie adaptation:\n\nCredit: Stephen Lovekin/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nWho Is Starring in 'It Ends With Us'?\n\nHoover revealed in January 2023 that Lively and Baldoni would be leading the film as Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid, respectively. ‚ÄúI think Justin and Blake have what it takes to bring these characters to life and I cannot wait for you guys to see that happen,‚Äù she said in an Instagram video filmed outside her childhood home.\n\nHoover went on to thank her mother, who helped serve as an inspiration for her novel.\n\n‚Äú[She] got us out of a scary situation when I was little and brought us here to this house which doesn‚Äôt look like much but was full of love and joy,‚Äù the author added. ‚ÄúSo thank you, Mom, for making that very difficult decision. ‚Ä¶ The fact that we are now discussing a movie that was made from a book that was loosely inspired by my mother, it‚Äôs bittersweet. So many people have had to go through [what she did], but to know my mom‚Äôs decision has helped so many people get out of that. I love you, Mom.‚Äù\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Justin Baldoni/Instagram\n\nWill the Adaptation of 'It Ends With Us' be Faithful to the Book?\n\nBaldoni assured fans that he was well aware of the importance of keeping the adaptation in line with the book. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I see EVERYTHING you all tag me in üíêüç™üìù,‚Äù he captioned a March 2022 TikTok of him typing furiously while ‚Äútrying to keep up with all the It Ends With Us casting, scene and song requests.‚Äù\n\nHoover shared in January 2023 that she would give fans as much insight as she could throughout the movie‚Äôs production. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do my best to try and sneak y'all as much footage as I can without getting kicked off set,\" she quipped via Instagram.\n\nThat July, Baldoni revealed that he and Hoover gathered a group of fans for a first look at the script. The pair used the opportunity to work with the group and ask what they could do to ensure the movie stayed true to the novel.\n\n‚ÄúA huge thank you to the thousands of LA area fans of It Ends With Us for submitting and for the ten we chose to join us for the special reading of the script,‚Äù Baldoni captioned a TikTok video at the time. ‚ÄúYour feedback and support was incredible! We are one step closer to making this movie thanks to you! We are beyond excited! More to come!‚Äù\n\nCredit: Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock\n\nWho Is Playing Allysa in ‚ÄòIt Ends With Us‚Äô?\n\nJenny Slate will portray Allysa, who is Lily‚Äôs best friend and Ryle‚Äôs sister, in the film adaptation.\n\n‚ÄúWe have our Allysa! @jennyslate is one of the most talented humans, I can‚Äôt even believe she‚Äôll be in this movie,‚Äù author Hoover gushed via Instagram in May 2023. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hungry right now because I‚Äôve been really freaking busy today so I can‚Äôt tell if I need to eat or if this nausea is from too much excitement. Gonna go eat a taco but I bet I‚Äôll feel the same way after that.‚Äù"
