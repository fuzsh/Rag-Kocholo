        "text": "My 5th principle of inclusive language is “Prevent erasure.”\n\nIn my book, The Inclusive Language Field Guide, I spend some time looking at the erasure of Native history here in the US. But I didn’t have space to go into the erasure of Native American languages.\n\nWhy are almost all of the original languages of the US endangered in some way? (In 1491, there were more than 300.)\n\nBecause of the purposeful actions of the US government. Along with the general cultural push towards English as the only appropriate language for people living on this land.\n\nIncluding abducting Native children, forcing them to attend residential schools where they were severely punished for speaking their home language, and adopting them out to European American families.\n\nThis is not ancient history. This is as late as the 1970s.\n\nPurposefully preventing the transmission of language and culture to the community’s children.\n\nNot only removing Native languages from public spaces but also from private ones.\n\nI once talked with an elder who said, “Sometimes when we speak [our language], I can still taste the soap they used to wash out my mouth when I spoke it with my cousin at school.”**\n\nDid you know any of this happened? I sure didn’t until grad school, and even then, I only learned because of my specialization in endangered languages.\n\nLast night, Lily Gladstone brought Siksiká back to the public space.\n\n“One of the first things we're taught is you say your name, you say where you're from and you say hello to everyone — hello, my friends,” Gladstone said. “So it was one of the more natural things I can do in the moment.” ***\n\nShe took Blackfeet culture and language to the stage. She said (here in translation): “Hello my friends/relatives. My name is Piitaaki (Eagle Woman). I am Blackfoot. I love you all.”\n\nThis is an example of language revitalization. Pushing back from the corner your language has been backed into. Bringing it back into spaces, or into new spaces, where it should belong.\n\nI want to also point out the ally work done by Leonardo DiCaprio during the press tour and awards season. Apparently DiCaprio hates and avoids the red carpet. But he has consistently attended and stood next to Gladstone on the film’s various red carpets, meaning that a photo of him would also be a photo of her.\n\nThis is great ally work, and a way to take your power and use it to amplify someone from a marginalized group who otherwise wouldn’t get that kind of attention.\n\n*This was the first time the award in this category was given to an Indigenous woman.\n\n** If you read my work, you’ll know that I talk a lot about the “flavor” of words. Well, for this elder, the “flavor” of his first language wasn’t a social science concept but the literal flavor of the soap used as punishment.\n\n*** Quote and translation from today.com, specifically from this article."
