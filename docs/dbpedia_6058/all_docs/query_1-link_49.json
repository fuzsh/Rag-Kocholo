        "text": "Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? Don’t think too hard about that age-old question right now, because we’re just going to go with the first option when it comes to this year’s movies that are based on true stories.\n\nOf course, films being based on or inspired by real-life events are a very common occurrence. Just look to every biopic, every movie based on a nonfiction book or article, and every movie a director makes that’s inspired by their own life. The list goes on and on. This year’s slate includes movies based on historical figures, on outrageous news stories, on true crimes of the past, and on the lives of iconic writers, musicians, and more.\n\nSome of the biopics out this year are about French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, and long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad. There are also films about more unlikely subjects, such as the man who claims he created Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and a bear that ate a bunch of cocaine in the 1980s. (Naturally, those movies are titled Flamin’ Hot and Cocaine Bear.)\n\nSo, if you’re a fan of movies that will immediately send you down a Wikipedia hole for more info after you’re done viewing them, check out the list below.\n\n(By the way, if you want to explore even more films, take a look at the 2022 list of movies based on true stories. They included stories about Weird Al, women warriors in 19th-century Africa, the #MeToo movement, and Elvis Presley—that one’s Elvis, obviously.)\n\nEmily\n\nAvailable to rent/buy now\n\nEmily is a biopic about Emily Brontë, the author of the 1847 novel Wuthering Heights and the sister of writers Anne and Charlotte Brontë who died at only 30. Part fiction, the movie focuses on a love story between Emily (Emma Mackey) and William Weightman (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), Emily’s writing, and her relationship with her sisters.\n\nCocaine Bear\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime now\n\nNope, it’s not a mistake. A movie about a bear that ingests a bunch of cocaine and goes on a killing spree is on the list of movies based on true stories. It’s just that the film from Elizabeth Banks exaggerates what actually happened: In 1985, a bear did eat a lot of cocaine after coming across a bag of it, but sadly, the real-life bear overdosed and died. The comedy-thriller film is much more outlandish.\n\nBoston Strangler\n\nStreaming on Hulu now\n\nTrue-crime fans may want to check out Boston Strangler. Keira Knightley stars as reporter Loretta McLaughlin, who broke the story of the so-called Boston Strangler, a man who killed 13 women in Boston in the 1960s. Carrie Coon costars as fellow reporter Jean Cole.\n\nAir\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime Video now\n\nBest friends and collaborators Ben Affleck and Matt Damon join forces once again for Air, which stars both actors and is also directed by Ben. The movie is about Sonny Vaccaro, a Nike executive who signed Michael Jordan to his sneaker deal with the company, launching the hugely popular Air Jordan sneakers line. Interestingly enough, while real-life couple Viola Davis and Julius Tennon play Michael’s parents in the film, the basketball legend himself is barely featured.\n\nChevalier\n\nStreaming on Hulu now\n\nKelvin Harrison Jr. stars in Chevalier as Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, a Black violinist and composer who came to fame in 18th-century France. The film depicts the racism Chevalier faced as well as his connection to the French upper class and royalty, including Marie Antoinette, who is played by Lucy Boynton.\n\nFlamin’ Hot\n\nStreaming on Hulu now\n\nIf you’re thinking, No way this movie is about Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, why, yes, it is. Eva Longoria makes her feature directorial debut in this film about Richard Montañez (Jesse Garcia), a Frito-Lay janitor who claims he invented the spicy snack.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nAvailable to rent/buy now\n\nOne half of the culture phenomenon Barbenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s latest movie tells the story of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Cillian Murphy stars in the title role, with costars including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nIn theaters and available to rent/buy now\n\nGet ready for awards season 2024. Martin Scorsese regulars Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro both star in the director’s latest movie, Killers of the Flower Moon. It’s based on the book of the same name by David Grann and it’s about the FBI’s investigation into several murders of members of the Osage Nation in the 1920s. Costars include Lily Gladstone and Jesse Plemons.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nNyad\n\nStreaming on Netflix now\n\nAnnette Bening stars in Nyad as Diana Nyad, who is known for swimming the 100 miles from Cuba to Florida in 2013 at age 64, decades after she began her long-distance swims. Jodie Foster plays her friend and coach, Bonnie Stoll.\n\nSTREAM HERE\n\nPriscilla\n\nIn theaters now\n\nShe's best known as Elvis Presley's wife, but Sofia Coppola's Priscilla tells the story of Priscilla Presley from her own point of view—and without Elvis' music. It starts with Priscilla as a 14-year-old living on a military base in Germany where she first meets 24-year-old Elvis and follows their often strained life together, as Priscilla gradually comes into her own.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nRustin\n\nStreaming on Netflix now\n\nRustin stars Colman Domingo as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. It is centered around his experience organizing the March on Washington at which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Additionally, it focuses on Rustin's personal life as a gay man in the 1960s.\n\nSTREAM HERE\n\nNapoleon\n\nIn theaters now\n\nNapoleon, if you couldn't tell, is a biopic about Napoleon Bonaparte. It follows his rise to power and the military campaigns he waged on the path to become the Emperor of France. The film also focuses on Napoleon's marriage to Joséphine de Beauharnais. Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby star as the infamous couple.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nMaestro\n\nIn theaters now; Streaming on Netflix Dec. 20\n\nAfter directing A Star Is Born, Bradley Cooper returns for another music-based movie. He directs and stars in Maestro, which is about composer Leonard Bernstein. The movie focuses particularly on his relationship with his wife, actor Felicia Montealegre, who is played by Carey Mulligan.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nSTREAM HERE\n\nMay December\n\nIn theaters and streaming on Netflix now\n\nMay December is not a true story, but it is inspired by one. The film is about an actor, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who visits a woman, Gracie (Julianne Moore), who was sentenced to prison after having a sexual relationship with a 7th grade boy named Joe—Elizabeth is set to play Gracie in a movie. In the present day, Gracie and a now-adult Joe (Charles Melton) are married. The story is inspired by that of Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nSTREAM HERE\n\nThe Iron Claw\n\nIn theaters Dec. 22\n\nThe Iron Claw is about the Von Erich family, which included several wrestlers, including five of the sons of Jack Adkisson, who used the stage name Fritz Von Erich. The family became known for the \"Von Erich curse\" due to the tragic ways in which many members died. The film's cast includes Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Lily James, and Harris Dickinson.\n\nBUY TICKETS HERE\n\nFerrari\n\nIn theaters Dec. 25\n\nAdam Driver stars in Ferrari as Enzo Ferrari, the race car driver who founded the car company Ferrari and the racing team Scuderia Ferrari. (Have I said \"Ferrari\" enough times?) The film is set in the late 1950s and focuses on the race Mille Miglia, as well as Ferrari's personal life, including his marriage to his wife, Laura (Penélope Cruz)."
