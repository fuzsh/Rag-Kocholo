        "text": "Lily Corrigan (née Bloom; formerly Kincaid) is the main protagonist in the It Ends With Us series. She is a college graduate who moved to Boston from Plethora, Maine along with her mother. She is the mother of Emmy Kincaid, ex-wife of Ryle Kincaid and wife of Atlas Corrigan.\n\nIn the film adaptation, It Ends With Us, Lily is portrayed by Blake Lively.\n\nBiography[]\n\nLily was a young college graduate living in Boston. One day, she was on a rooftop, clearing her thoughts after her father’s funeral. There, she encountered Ryle Kincaid, a resident surgeon. The couple felt chemistry between them immediately, but Ryle only wanted a casual fling, while Lily was looking for a relationship. The two part ways but met again six months later, when Lily hired Ryle’s sister, Allysa, to work at a flower shop she had recently opened using her inheritance money. Lily and Ryle’s attraction to each other only increased the more they see each other, until Ryle decided to explore a relationship with Lily, despite his earlier reluctance. Throughout this time, Lily found herself revisiting her past and longing for closure with the death of her father, who was abusive towards her mother. To find it, she reread old journals that she wrote when she was 15. Those journals narrated her encounter with Atlas Corrigan, a homeless, 18-year-old boy. As a teen, Lily was moved to help him when he was without a home and family, and they became close when he supported Lily through her witnessing her father abusing her mother. In the present day, Lily wondered if she isn’t also seeking closure with Atlas as well.\n\nThe romance between Lily and Ryle appeared perfect, their feelings only intensifying as they spend more time together and become embedded in each other’s lives. Lily and Allysa were now best friends, and Ryle even meets Lily's mother. One night while having dinner with Ryle and her mother, Lily ran into Atlas. She hadn’t seen him for nine years, and although she was happy that he seemed well, she felt hurt at the distance between them. In the end, she told herself that this was the closure she had sought, especially now that she was with Ryle. However, Lily and Ryle’s happiness came to an end when during an evening she and Ryle spent together, Ryle lashed out in a rage, hurting Lily. Afterward, Ryle was apologetic and Lily allowed him to comfort her, feeling confused and hurt about the incident. Ryle swore that he wasn’t like Lily’s father, who Lily had told him about. Lily threatened to leave him if it happened again and told herself that Ryle was not like her father.\n\nThe next day, Lily, Ryle, Allysa, and Marshall were eating at the restaurant where Lily saw Atlas. Atlas saw Lily’s wounded eye and Ryle’s bandaged hand and comes to the correct conclusion that Ryle has assaulted Lily.\n\nWhen Atlas confronted Lily in the restroom, she defended Ryle. Furious, Atlas compared Lily to her mother, whose abuse he had witnessed years ago when he and Lily had been close. Ryle found them talking and Atlas attacked him, eventually throwing him out of the restaurant. Ryle asked Lily for reassurance that she wasn’t being unfaithful to him with Atlas. Lily stressed to him that she only has feelings for Ryle.\n\nAtlas came to Lily’s shop and apologized to Lily for comparing her to her mother at the restaurant. He brought her a gift that he had gotten her long ago and left his phone number, in case of an emergency. His visit and concern remind Lily of her attachment to Atlas years ago. For months, Atlas lived in an abandoned house with Lily providing him food, clothing, use of her home’s shower, and her bedroom floor to sleep on during winter. Lily also provided him help and companionship, their relationship changed from friendship to romance. Atlas was eventually able to contact an uncle and left for Boston to live with him, leaving Lily heartbroken, but happy that he had found a place to stay. Atlas returned on Lily’s sixteenth birthday, promising to find her in the future, but that night, Lily’s father finds Atlas with Lily in her room and attacks him, sending him to the hospital. Lily hadn’t heard from Atlas since then and always felt sadness that Atlas never tried to find her as he promised. However, she knew now that her future was with Ryle.\n\nThis seemed to be the case as Lily met Ryle's parents, and she and Ryle decided to get married. One night, Ryle found Atlas's number on Lily's phone. Jealous and upset, Ryle left. When Lily went after him to try to explain, Ryle pushed her down the stairs. In the aftermath, Ryle at first refused responsibility for his actions and simply asked Lily to tell him that she wasn’t being unfaithful. Lily explained how Atlas came to her shop and threw Ryle out of her apartment. Ryle again pleaded for forgiveness and even approached his sister, who interceded for Ryle. Ryle told Lily the story of how his brother died when 6-year-old Ryle accidentally shot him. Since then, Ryle confessed, he had suffered from rages. Lily was torn between her feelings for Ryle and the resemblances between her situation, and the abusive situation between her father and mother. Lily told him that she was willing to help Ryle, but that she needed to know when he needed help.\n\nAfter the incident, Ryle appeared to be improving, but one night he again confronted Lily over her relationship with Atlas, threatening her, almost raping her, and hurting her when she tried to defend herself. Lily called Atlas and left for the hospital, where she discovered that she was pregnant.\n\nDistraught, Lily went to stay with Atlas for several days. Ryle found her at her shop after but told her that he was leaving for England for three months. Not ready to go back to her apartment, Lily returned to Atlas’s place. Atlas admitted to Lily that he did look for her after he finished his first tour, but found her happy and didn’t think his life was good enough for her then. He took her back to her apartment and confessed he had feelings for her. He made clear that he understood that she was busy with her own situation now, and only hoped that someday a relationship between them could be possible.\n\nAs time passes, Lily felt torn about telling both Allysa and her mother about her pregnancy. She felt alone and in need of their support, but she was frightened that they would convince her to take Ryle back. Allysa, however, suspected that something had happened between Lily and Ryle and confronted Lily. Relieved, Lily discussed the abuse she had suffered, as well as her pregnancy. Despite Ryle being Allysa’s brother, Allysa urged Lily to leave him. Lily finally approached her mother, who spoke of her own experience with abuse and how she became more tolerant of it the longer she stayed. Lily’s mother also encouraged Lily to leave Ryle.\n\nRyle had returned and learned about Lily’s pregnancy. He wanted her forgiveness, but Lily kept him at a distance. Eventually, she let him participate as a father, helping her during the final months of the pregnancy. Despite accepting his help, Lily refused to make a decision about their relationship before the birth. After Lily gives birth to a girl, she realized that she didn’t want her baby to grow up witnessing abuse. She decided that the cycle of abuse ended with her and her mother. Hence, the title- \"it ends with us\". She decided that she would divorce Ryle to break the pattern of domestic violence. Eleven months later, she ran into Atlas and indicated that she was ready to have a relationship with him. They are now married; raising her daughter, Emmy, along with his little brother, Josh.\n\nPersonality traits[]\n\nLily speaks her mind. She is described by her mother as “brave and bold” but she is also compassionate. Lily demonstrates compassion by helping Atlas despite being taught by her father that people in difficult situations don’t deserve help, and despite the pressure of her friends, and classmates. She even demonstrates compassion to Ryle after he has hurt her.\n\nPhysical description[]\n\nLily has red hair and pretty red lips. She has a small tattoo of a simple heart outline, slightly open at the top, located over her shoulder near the top of her collarbone. She got this tattoo in college because Atlas would always kiss that spot.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRomances[]\n\nAtlas Corrigan[]\n\nAtlas is her husband.\n\nRyle Kincaid[]\n\nRyle is her ex-husband and the father of her child, Emmy.\n\nFamily[]\n\nJenny Bloom[]\n\nTBA\n\nAndrew Bloom[]\n\nTBA\n\nFriends[]\n\nTBA\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"But sometimes you can't control where your mind goes. You just have to train it not to go there anymore.\" - Lily Bloom\n\n\"Five minutes. That's all it takes to completely destroy a person.\" - Lily Bloom\n\n\"Maybe those vows weren't meant to be taken literally. For better, for worse?

Lily hoped that strength would be the most important trait her daughter possessed.[1]"
