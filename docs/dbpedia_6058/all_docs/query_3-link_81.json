        "text": "Efron was cast as Ted Bundy in 2017. He later said he had trouble \"separating himself\" from Bundy once filming was done each day, and told Entertainment Weekly about his methods of coping with the heavy material.\n\n\"I did breathing and meditation. I think that’s the only way. I really love TM, transcendental meditation...so on the way home I just do some TM and try to phase out of it. Really, you can’t ever really let go of all of it. There’s always a little bit of you that knows tomorrow you’re Ted.\"\n\nBetween 1974 and 1978, Bundy attacked, murdered, and/or raped at least 30 women. Some of those women have never been found or identified, and some reports say the number of Bundy's victims is closer to 100.\n\nHe was first arrested in 1975, and he escaped from prison twice. Bundy was eventually executed in the Florida State Penitentiary in 1989.\n\nCollins plays Bundy's girlfriend Elizabeth \"Liz\" Kloepfer, and the movie is based on her 1981 memoir, The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy.\"\n\nAfter Kloepfer agreed to let the producers of the film move forward with the project, Collins and director Joe Berlinger met with her. Kloepfer showed them letters and family photos of her with Bundy, according to Esquire.\n\n\"She was willing and passionate about meeting me—her and her daughter, too,” Collins told E! News.\n\nElizabeth's last name is actually Kloepfer, but she wrote her book under the name \"Elizabeth Kendall\" to protect her identity. Kloepfer met Bundy in 1969, and the young single mother quickly fell for him.\n\nTheir relationship had frequent ups and downs, and Bundy often saw other women on the side. Kloepfer began to notice odd items in Bundy's possession, but he usually had an easy explanation when questioned. As more women went missing, Kloepfer began to suspect her boyfriend, and she ended up reporting Bundy to the police various times. She eventually helped investigators put him behind bars, but they remained in contact until about 1978.\n\nThe U.K.-born Scodelario plays Bundy's wife Carole. The actress told Elle that she worked hard to portray Carole correctly.\n\n\"It's the first time I've played a character who may still be alive, or that at least existed once. For me, I really wanted to dig into that. We managed to find some archival pictures of her doing interviews, because she was very vocal during the trial....I could get her voice down and her mannerism and her jaw line—she had a bit of an underbite—things like that.\"\n\nAfter sentencing Bundy to death, Cowart gave a famous closing statement, from which the title of the film gets its name:\n\n\"The court finds that both of these killings were indeed heinous, atrocious and cruel. And that they were extremely wicked, shockingly evil, vile and the product of a design to inflict a high degree of pain and utter indifference to human life.\n\nIt is ordered that you be put to death by a current of electricity, that that current be passed through your body until you are dead.\n\nYou’re an intelligent young man. You’d have made a good lawyer and I would have loved to have you practice in front of me, but you went another way, partner. Take care of yourself. I don’t feel any animosity toward you. I want you to know that. Once again, take care of yourself.”"
