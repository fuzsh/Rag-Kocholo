        "text": "If you’re looking for a cosy new rom-com to curl up to on the sofa this month, Netflix’s Love At First Sight might just be what you’re looking for.\n\nStarring The White Lotus’ Haley Lu Richardson and Ben Hardy of Bohemian Rhapsody and X-Men: Apocalypse, the film follows two strangers who connect on their flight to London only to be separated by a twist of fate – but love and destiny might just help them defy the odds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a cast that also includes Jameela Jamil as the narrator, alongside Rob Delaney, Dexter Fletcher and more, Love At First Sight boasts an impressive collective resume of credits.\n\nHere’s your guide to the cast…\n\nHaley Lu Richardson as Hadley\n\nThe US actor, who plays Hadley Sullivan in Love At First Sight, is perhaps best known for her role as Portia in HBO’s dark mystery-drama The White Lotus, in which she plays the downtrodden assistant of Tanya McQuoid-Hunt, played by Jennifer Coolidge.\n\nIn another turn as a hopeless romantic, Haley also starred as the Jonas Brothers super-fan in their music video for 2023 single Wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer other forays into rom-coms include 2019’s Five Feet Apart, in which she played Stella opposite Cole Sprouse. Other recent film credits also include neo-Western Montana Story, sci-fi drama After Yang and 2020’s Unpregnant opposite Euphoria’s Barbie Ferreira.\n\nBen Hardy as Oliver\n\nAppearing in the role of charming love interest Oliver Jones, the actor and former soap star has previously featured in huge blockbusters including X-Men: Apocalypse and Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, in which he took on the role of Queen drummer Roger Taylor.\n\nBen’s TV credits, meanwhile, include Call The Midwife, The Girl Before, Drunk History: UK and, of course, EastEnders as Peter Beale.\n\nHis film career includes appearances in Mary Shelley, Only The Brave, Underground, Pixie and Unicorns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJameela Jamil as the narrator\n\nFeaturing as Love At First Sight’s all-knowing narrator, Jameela made her acting debut as Tahani in The Good Place, appearing opposite the likes of Kristen Bell, William Jackson Harper, Ted Danson and D’Arcy Carden.\n\nSince then, she’s gone on to collect credits in shows including Poker Face, Star Trek: Prodigy and She Hulk: Attorney At Law.\n\nShe’s also previously hosted Channel 4′s former teen strand T4 and been a presenter of BBC Radio 1’s Official Chart, and has made appearances in numerous campaigns.\n\nRob Delaney as Andrew\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American comedian and actor, who plays Hadley’s recently divorced dad, Andrew, earned critical acclaim with his Channel 4 TV series Catastrophe opposite Sharon Horgan, and became known in the British comedy world with Comedy Central UK’s Rob Delaney’s Stand Up Central.\n\nFans will also remember Rob as the powerless Peter W in Deadpool 2, who joins the X-Force alongside Ryan Reynolds. He’s also featured in huge releases including this year’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and Mac in the Black Mirror episode Joan Is Awful from the latest season.\n\nDexter Fletcher as Val\n\nThe Bafta-nominated director, actor and filmmaker made his first on-camera appearance at just six years old, before going on to play Baby Face in Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone.\n\nNotably, he went on to direct the 2019 Elton John biopic Rocketman and 2015’s Eddie The Eagle about British underdog ski jumper Eddie Edwards, both starring Taron Egerton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis more recent acting turns include Ghosted, Terminal, Double Date, Eat Locals and Smoking Guns.\n\nSally Philips as Tessa\n\nYou’ll recognise Sally for her role as best friend Shazza in all three of the Bridget Jones films, while her TV credits include Hapless, Jerk, Pennyworth, Murder, They Hope and Breeders.\n\nRecent turns on the big screen include My Happy Ending starring Andie MacDowell, Coffee Wars, and 2019’s Blinded By The Light about a British teenager’s discovery of Bruce Springsteen’s life-changing music.\n\nKatrina Nare as Charlotte\n\nStar Wars fans might remember Katrina from Disney+ series Andor, who featured as Windi in episode seven of season one, titled Announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer TV credits span a host of shows such as 2020’s Breeders starring Martin Freeman, and guest appearances in EastEnders and Holby City.\n\nKatrina’s recent film features include Doom: Annihilation and The Car: Road To Revenge.\n\nTom Taylor as Luther\n\nThe British actor is indeed the grown up face of Tom from BBC One’s hit drama Doctor Foster."
