        "text": "Colleen Hoover's bestselling novel \"It Ends with Us\" is getting the Hollywood treatment.\n\nOut Aug. 9, the movie stars Blake Lively as Lily Bloom, Hoover's enduring heroine. In addition to producing and directing, Justin Baldoni stars opposite Lively as Ryle Kincaid, the alluring surgeon who ends up plunging Lily into a cycle of violence.\n\nSpeaking to Jenna Bush Hager at her own book festival Book Bonanza in 2023, Hoover expressed her shock after hearing Lively was cast.\n\n“I didn’t believe it … I have been obsessed with Blake Lively since ‘Gossip Girl’ days — I’m just a huge fan of hers, and of course of her husband,” she said, referring to Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nSome fans took issue with Lively's casting, however. The criticism mostly related to the differences in age of the main characters from the book and the movie. Lively is older than Lily is written as being.\n\nHoover, speaking to Jenna, said the movie rectifies something she \"messed up\" with the book.\n\n“As I started making this movie, I’m like, we need to age them out, because I messed up,” she said. “So that’s my fault.”\n\nBlake Lively as Lily Bloom\n\nBlake Lively has gone from \"Gossip Girl\" blond to red hair for \"It Ends With Us.\" Her character, Lily, is an aspiring florist who escapes from a violent childhood, only to end up in a violent romantic relationship. She finds solace in her childhood friend, Atlas, who returns to her life.\n\n“Lily resonated with an enormous amount of people, as the success of the book made clear,” Lively told People. “Stepping into a character who’s had such a meaningful impact is an honor to take on.”\n\nHoover shared her excitement with the rest of the world on her Instagram page, writing, “Our Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively. Blake Lively, y’all. She’s my dream Lily,.\"\n\nJustin Baldoni as Ryle Kincaid\n\nThe 39-year-old actor directs and stars in \"It Ends With Us,\" playing neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. He's also producing the film through his entertainment company.\n\nBaldoni is perhaps most familiar for playing Rafael on \"Jane the Virgin.\" Since then, he's moved into directing and being an outspoken advocate for redefining masculinity. He published a memoir \"Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity\" after a TED Talk on the same topic went viral. The sequel \"Boys Will Be Human\" was published in 2022.\n\nBrandon Sklenar as Atlas Corrigan\n\nAt the heart of \"It Ends with Us\" is a love triangle. Brandon Sklenar plays one of its three figures: Atlas Corrigan, Lily's childhood friend. Atlas lived with Lily when he was struggling in high school. Then, he reappears in her life when she's struggling in her marriage.\n\nSklenar commented on the casting on Instagram. “When this project came along I wasn’t aware of this book or the tremendous impact it has had on women all over the world in helping them to have the strength to change their lives”, he writes, “It is our intention that this film continues to spread the vital message of this book; for women to feel empowered and men to be better. I’m honored to be a part of it.” Safe to say the actor is honored to be a part of Colleen — verse,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nSklenar played Spencer Dutton in Paramount+’s \"Yellowstone\" spinoff \"1923.\"\n\nJenny Slate as Allysa\n\nJenny Slate is known for her comedic roles and may bring a dash of levity into a move with dark themes. She's playing Ryle's sister, Allyssa, who becomes a close friend of Lily's.\n\nYou may know her from her many appearances across movies and TV, including \"Parks & Recreation,\" \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" and \"Gifted.\" She lended her voice to Marcel in \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On,\" Tammy in \"Bob's Burgers\" and Missy in \"Big Mouth.\"\n\nHasan Minhaj as Marshall\n\nComedian and television host Hasan Minhaj plays of Marshall, Allyssa’s (Jenny Slate) husband. He hosted the Netflix show \"Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj\" for six season and appeared on \"The Morning Show\" in a dramatic role."
