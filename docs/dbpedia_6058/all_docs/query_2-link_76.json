        "text": "In the market for a V-Day romantic comedy? Lily Collins and Sam Claflin's new movie Love, Rosie hits theaters this Friday and it might just be on par with our faves, like Love Actually and Bridget Jones's Diary. Yep, you're in for a treat.\n\nIn the flick, Lily and Sam play two friends who have been inseparable since childhood, but as they get older, things become a little more confusing. After a crazy night out changes their entire lives, they're left trying to figure out where their relationship stands. You know how love is.\n\nWhen we caught up with the stars of the film, we talked about everything from their favorite scenes to filming in Ireland to secrets about each other. We're jealous already. Here's to hoping they're accepting applications to join in on this adorable friendship.\n\nTell us about your characters.\n\nSam: I've never played a character so close to home—there are so many parallels between our two lives. Every decision Alex Stewart makes in this movie is one I probably would have made at that time for one reason or another. He's a dreamer, but at the same time he's a man with a plan.\n\nLily: What I love the most about Rosie is the fact that she seems so fragile and delicate, but she's so strong and resilient. I really admire the fact that I finally found this character who gets to be a young mom and portrays teen pregnancy in a way that's positive and inspiring as opposed to this negative turn that reality TV has taken. I found her to be such a clumsy, quirky, relatable, awkward girl who I think anyone can find themselves being. Everyone has a Rosie and an Alex—the one who got away. I really respected the way she handled herself throughout what most people would consider a bump in the road—literally.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming?\n\nSam: Lily and I started in Toronto and filmed there for a week and then we went to Dublin and filmed for about two months. I was only there for a few weeks, but what was interesting was Lily said she basically shot an entirely different movie with the same cast except for me. It was so intimate and so much about us two that when I left she said she sort of informed her character what it's like to miss someone.\n\nLily: I've never shot in Europe before. The people are known as being so accepting and welcoming and fun. I don't know how we ended up finishing on time and with the amount of work we did because everyone was constantly spending time together and going out after work and having this amazing camp-like experience. Ireland was stunning, though. It was so green—there were castles and these rolling hills. We really got to see the ins and outs of Dublin and a little bit of the outside countryside and it was beautiful.\n\nWhat did you do for fun off set?\n\nSam: We went to go watch the Champions League final. The director and a couple of the producers were German, and it was a German final. So we went to watch it together and sang a lot of Irish songs. Every weekend we'd all meet up and go for dinner. We were all able to be happy in each other's company, which is always a bonus with this job.\n\nLily: We hung out a lot on Grafton Street in Dublin and saw the musicians playing there. Sam and I also went to the wax museum, which was kind of hilarious and amazing. We went to Wicklow while filming in the countryside. I didn't get to drive around a lot and see the cliffs and the castles, but I really want to go back someday.\n\nWhat was your favorite scene to shoot?\n\nSam: There are so many fond memories I'll take away from shooting, but it was probably one of the first days of filming. Lily and I were doing a party scene in Boston where we get thrown into a pool. It was so cold and you could see the steam coming off the pool so you knew it was going to be warm. For hours and hours we were dancing around the side of the pool saying how we couldn't wait to go in, so when it eventually happened we were very happy and didn't want to get out. That same day we also shot a scene during the sunrise of us two breaking fortune cookies. It was six in the morning on the first day of shooting, and you kind of just walk away thinking if it's going to be like this every day, it's going to be very special.\n\nLily: There were so many funny moments. I think some of my favorites were the dancing scenes with Sam because it brought me back—basically I was reliving times with my best friends. It made me realize how much I missed kind of letting go. As a young kid you don't have certain responsibilites, but at that time you feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders. Even now I still feel that at 25. I need to let go more, and playing out those scenes was such a fun time and genuinely we were just ourselves.\n\nTell us something we wouldn't know about your castmate.\n\nSam: I suppose she's really clumsy. I think we both have that going for us, but I think with Lily she seems very dainty and so delicate—like a litle bird. But she's actually a little bird with big wings and she's going places. She's spectacular to watch and as a person she's incredible.\n\nLily: He's the goofiest person. He genuinely is so goofy and has no problem being self-depricating. He doesn't take himself too seriously. I think a lot of people probably think a handsome young British actor has an ego after being in these huge Hunger Games movies, but no—this guy totally likes to have fun and is super genuine.\n\nWant more Lily and Sam?
