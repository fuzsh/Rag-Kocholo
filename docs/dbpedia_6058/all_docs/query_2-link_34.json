        "text": "Despite walking away from the Oscars 2024 empty-handed, Lily Gladstone says she is “feeling the love big time.” The Killers of the Flower Moon star, who would have become the first Indigenous or Native American person to win an Oscar for acting, came up short in the night’s tightest race against eventual winner Emma Stone for Poor Things.\n\nOn Monday, Gladstone said she was absorbing the post-Oscars support “especially from Indian Country,” she tweeted. “Kittō”kuniikaakomimmō”po’waw - seriously, I love you all.” In parentheses, she added alongside a winking emoji, “Better believe when I was leaving the Dolby Theatre and walked passed the big Oscar statue I gave that golden booty a little Coup tap - Count: one.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAlthough Gladstone was not one of the Oscars 2024 winners and Killers was snubbed entirely, the actor said she felt represented onstage by best-original-song nominee Scott George performing Killers of the Flower Moon’s “Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)” with the Osage Singers during the telecast. “When watching the Osage Singers at the Oscars, my inner voice said, ‘They’re the ones bringing us all up on stage tonight, that’s how it should be,’” Gladstone wrote in another tweet. “The history in the film and of the moment rightfully belong to the Osage Nation. What an honor to be close enough to feel the drum.”\n\nThe actor paid tribute to her communities with both her ceremony look and her Vanity Fair Oscar party look, which saw Gucci collaborate with Joe Big Mountain and Sunshine Big Mountain of Ironhorse Quillwork for each dress. “I think a rising tide lifts all ships,” Gladstone said in the Vanity Fair Hollywood issue of the impact her presence had on the awards trail. “I was just visiting with [Reservation Dogs cocreator] Sterlin Harjo about this a couple of days ago. We’re good friends,” she continued. “He was talking about how when he kicked the door down, sometimes it’s like you also can’t be the one to run through it because that’s why the door closes behind you. You kick the door down to hold it open. That’s kind of what it feels like right now.”\n\nAfter winning the Screen Actors Guild award, a Golden Globe (for drama), and several other critics prizes for her performance as Mollie Burkhart in Martin Scorsese’s latest, Gladstone became close with several of her fellow nominees. At one point during Sunday’s ceremony, she could be seen embracing Nyad’s Annette Bening and Stone. “We call each other Infinity Stones,” Gladstone told Vanity Fair’s Katey Rich earlier this year, showing off a ring that Stone gifted her. “She sent me a picture of her wearing the same one because we became fast friends in this whole process,” she explained.\n\nAfter the Academy Awards, Gladstone’s next projects include The Memory Police, a film adapted from the acclaimed Yoko Ogowa novel by Oscar winner Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) and helmed by Emmy winner Reed Morano (The Handmaid’s Tale), as well as Hulu’s Emmy-contending limited series Under the Bridge, costarring Riley Keough. As VF contributor Joe Reid put it after her loss: “Guess we’ll just have to keep casting Lily Gladstone in great movies with great scripts until she gets her moment too. I’m in if you are.”\n\nThe Best Moments From the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party\n\nHollywood\n\nEmmys 2024 Nominations: The Biggest Snubs and Surprises\n\nSelena Gomez finally makes the cut, while a few beloved Oscar winners surprisingly do not.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Morning Show Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nTwo Oscar winners are joining the already starry cast for season four, which must answer a lot of major questions: “Everybody keeps asking me if Bradley’s in jail,” Reese Witherspoon says.\n\nTelevision\n\nEGOT Watch: Which 2024 Emmy Nominees Could Join the Club This Year?\n\nWith their most recent nomination for best original musical and lyrics, superstar songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul must have an EGOT win on their minds.
