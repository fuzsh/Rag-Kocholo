In the novel, Lily is 23 years old and Ryle is 30, but Lively is 35 and Baldoni is 39. In press with Entertainment Tonight, Lively has praised Slate's performance as a standout in the film, calling her \"full of love and light.\"\n\nSlate's journey to landing this coveted role was not an easy one. Slate beat out several A-list actors for the role, including Daisy Edgar-Jones, Lucy Hale, Florence Pugh, Margot Robbie, Saoirse Ronan and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nWhen to watch 'It Ends With Us' on opening weekend\n\nOn Thursday, Aug. 8, audiences can view the film at AMC Dartmouth Mall 11 at 2, 5, 7:30, 8 and 10:05 p.m. The Picture Show at South Coast Marketplace in Fall River is showing the film at 2:50, 6 and 9:10 p.m.\n\nOn Friday, Aug. 9, AMC Dartmouth Mall is showing the film at 11 a.m., 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9:55 p.m.; on Saturday at noon, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 p.m.\n\nA full list of showtimes are available on the film's official website.\n\nFree outdoor concerts this summer: A guide to the New Bedford and Fall River area\n\nWho is Jenny Slate?\n\nBorn and raised in Milton, Slate rose to fame after appearing on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But it was her voice acting that first put her on the map with roles on \"Bob's Burgers,\" \"Big Mouth,\" and \"Zootopia.\" However, Slate's talents extend far beyond acting.\n\nSlate has also gained recognition and critical acclaim for her stand-up comedy and live variety shows in New York City and for co-creating, writing and producing the children's short film and book series \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.\"\n\nSlate is currently filming another movie locally in Massachusetts alongside Amy Adams titled \"At The Sea.\" The film has been shooting in various locations around the state, including Marshfield, Plymouth and Cape Cod.\n\nShe lives in Dartmouth with husband, author Ben Shattuck."
