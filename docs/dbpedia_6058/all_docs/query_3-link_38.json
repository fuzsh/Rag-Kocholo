        "text": "Aubrey Andersonâ€“Emmons made history at the age of four by becoming the youngest ever nominee and recipient of a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance as Lily Tucker-Pritchett on the hit show Modern Family. Now, at the tender age of 11, she is entering her eighth year as a series regular, where she has increased cultural diversity awareness as an Asian American playing a trans-racial adoptee of gay parents.\n\nEven with her busy work, school and play schedule, Aubrey has donated her time to support such charitable organizations as St. Jude's Hospital, California Covenant House Youth Shelter, Let Them Play Sports Organization, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Olive Crest, Help A Mother Out, My Stuff Bags, EIF Revlon Run/Walk For Women and Dave Thomas Foundation For Adoption.\n\nBorn in June of 2007 in Santa Monica, California, Aubrey loves all animals and enjoys a wide variety of activities, including swimming, biking, playing with her two dogs, riding her pony, skateboarding, attending movies and of course going to Disneyland and Disney World. Recently, after attending a trip to NYC, Aubrey fell in love with musical theater. She is currently training in vocal and dance instruction with the aim to one day star on the Broadway stage."
