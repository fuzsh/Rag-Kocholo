Plot

Fitz Wynn, a truly talented but overly-satisfied stage actor, wants to star in a new movie written by his wife, Lily.

She does not feel her Fitz is right for the part, and explains to him why and what she is looking for in the role. Fitz proceeds to orchestrate his own transformation into Roberto Terranova, a blonde Italian who seems to be exactly what Lily wants.
