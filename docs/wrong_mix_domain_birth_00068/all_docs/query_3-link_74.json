        "text": "Since the release of his debut album, the Illmatic back in 1994, American rapper Nasir Jones, popularly known as NAS, has impacted the Hip-Hop scene in many ways, from his quirky way of rhyming, to the content of the lyrics, the chosen producers for each track, not to mention the attitude and his artistic charisma.\n\nBorn in the Queens borough, New York, NAS has set a new tone for the East Coast rap performed in the 1990s, given the visibility of artists and the wider hip-hop scene on the West Coast. He helped other New York rappers and their generation to be successful in their respective arts and expressions – AZ, Mobb Deep, Nature, Cormega, Noreaga, Capone are some well-known examples of that.\n\nWe can’t help remembering how the aesthetics and texture of his album covers would also influence the artistic conception of most musical genres. The art direction of each album stood out for the natural way he presented everyday situations, mainly for not navigating through clichés such as gold chains, weapons, cars, etc."
