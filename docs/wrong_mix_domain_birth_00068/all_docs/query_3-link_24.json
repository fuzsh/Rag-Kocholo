About four years later, a custody battle resulted in Nas and his older brother moving to the Atlanta suburbs to live with their father and stepmother.\n\nNas has said he wasaware he was gay since he was 5 years old. As he got older, he witnessed the bullying and homophobia people who came out had to deal with and decided he would always stay in the closet. His father was a gospel singer and Nas had to attend church. At one point, \"I even thought, 'If I have these feelings, it's just a test. A temporary test. It's going to go away. God is just tempting me.\"\n\nNas kept his head down in high school. His main focus was online life as a superfan of Nicki Minaj. On Twitter as @nasmaraj, Nas interacted with other Minaj admirers — — and learned how to get attention on social media.\n\nNas enrolled in the University of West Georgia to study computer science, but he didn't like college.
