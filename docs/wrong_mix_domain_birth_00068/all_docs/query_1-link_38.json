        "text": "Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a drug withdrawal syndrome that occurs among opioid-exposed infants shortly after birth. NAS is associated with poor fetal growth and preterm birth, and can cause symptoms such as seizures, excessive irritability, poor feeding, and dehydration.\n\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome refers to the collection of signs and symptoms that occur when a newborn prenatally exposed to prescribed, diverted, or illicit opiates experiences opioid withdrawal. Symptoms of NAS include: irritability, tremors, feeding problems, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and, in some cases, seizures.\n\nIn addition to the direct symptoms of NAS, infants with NAS are more likely to experience other adverse outcomes and complications at birth, including: low birth weight, respiratory problems, jaundice, feeding difficulties, seizures, and sepsis.\n\nThe rise in NAS rates is different across geography of the state. Between 2011-2016, NAS rates increased by: 27% in the Collar counties, 137% in urban counties outside the Chicago area, and 223% in rural counties. In comparison, the NAS rates decreased by 9% in Chicago and increased by only 2% in suburban Cook County during this time period."
