        "text": "When you think about MCs from Queens,NY one of the first names that comes to mind is Nasir Jones. His style and lyrics were cultivated in the famous Queens Bridge Housing projects and for years he as served as a proud ambassador of the Q-Boro. Nas even returned to his old stomping grounds to record is latest video, “Nasty.” However, Nas wasn’t actually born in Queens.\n\nTake A Tour Of Nas’ Birthplace\n\nThe prolific Virgo was born in Brooklyn Jewish Hospital on September 14, 1973. According to his father, Olu Dara, a young Nas cut his musical chops on the streets of BK.\n\n“I thought that he would become a great trumpeter because he was playing to audiences in the streets of Brooklyn when he was three or four,” he told The Source magazine in an August 2004 cover story. “He used to draw a lot of crowds [on Eastern Parkway]. It was fascinating to me. But his lip was becoming distorted so I made him quit. I remember him being very disappointed when I told him to stop playing.”\n\nNeedless to say Nas has done ok without the trumpet. But maybe it’s something he’ll pass it down to his son, Knight.\n\nMore Black History Month content…\n\nFACT OF THE DAY: Common Was A Bookworm At FAMU\n\nPop Culture Moment #1: Chappelle’s Show Premieres"
