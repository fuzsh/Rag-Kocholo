        "text": "Welcome to Naval Air Station Whiting Field, located in beautiful northwest Florida. Naval Air Station Whiting Field occupies approximately 12,000 acres, including 12 outlying fields with three separate and fully operational airfields.\n\nNaval Air Station Whiting Field is the home of Training Air Wing FIVE, and together we form the backbone of Naval Aviation Training. More than 60 percent of all primary flight training is performed at NAS Whiting Field and every Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard helicopter pilot receives their initial rotary winged training here. Roughly 17 percent of all Navy flight hours are flown here annually as well as approximately 12 percent of all Navy and Marine Corps flight hours.\n\nTraining Air Wing FIVE hosts 142 T-6 Texan II aircraft for fixed-wing training and 112 TH-57 helicopters for rotary wing training. Training Air Wing FIVE is currently in the process of transitioning the advanced helicopter training program to the new TH-73A Thrasher helicopter. With more than 250 aircraft, the two airfields at NAS Whiting Field proper are augmented with 12 additional Navy Outlying Landing Fields (NOLFs) where approximately 120,000 to 160,000 flight hours are flown here annually. This accounts for approximately one million flight hours each year, more than Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport - the busiest civilian airport in the United States.\n\nWhile NAS Whiting Field is the busiest Naval Air Station in the world, it is also located in an area with some of the most beautiful beaches and natural beauty in the world. From expansive forests, to the pristine Blackwater River, to the crystal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Santa Rosa County is a great place to live and work.\n\nInstallation Information"
