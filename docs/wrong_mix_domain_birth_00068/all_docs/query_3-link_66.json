        "text": "A genreâs quintessential recording is forged from the eternal quest for artistic perfection: Nas established hip-hopâs apogee with his first album, Illmatic. Born Nasir Jones in New York City in 1973, the son of jazz musician Olu Dara redefined hip-hop in 1994 with his debut, flipping tales of structural poverty into intricate hood scripture and fomenting the boom bap style. His follow-up, 1996âs baroque and brooding It Was Written, reinvigorated mafioso rap and built Nasâ standing as musicâs foremost chronicler of crime, a distinction he vividly defended with Stillmatic in 2001. On that album, Nas realized new modes of narrative (in âRewindâ) and spectacle (with the eruptive âOne Micâ), distilling his ability to document street life like few others in rap. Evolving from Queensbridge project laureate to sage social documentarian, Nas certified a parabolic legacy throughout the 2000s, charging his allegorical, compound rhymes with public commentary. Energized by his stirring blue-sky alliance with reggae scion Damien Marley, 2010âs Distant Relatives, Nas returned with the cultured Life Is Good in 2012, leading the golden age into the present with midlife verity, a winning composite he continued with the 2020 album Kingâs Disease. Reflecting on three decades of influence so far, Nas told Apple Music, âIâve been blessed enough to see a gift in myself, polish it, present it to the world, and light comes to it.â"
