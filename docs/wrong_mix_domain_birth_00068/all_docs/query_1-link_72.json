        "text": "Ref: NASWHIDBEYINST 5530.5 Chapter 13: ACCESS CONTROL\n\nNaval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI) is a controlled access installation.\n\nVisitor Control Centers (VCCs) are responsible for authenticating an individual's identity, vetting, and determining their eligibility prior to authorizing access to the installation.\n\nAs of noon on Friday, May 17, 2024, NASWI will require 100% ID Card inspection at the Entry Control Points (ECP). Escorted travel continues to be approved, and the escort must ensure all passengers (18 years and older) have valid U.S. Identification to enter the Installation. For Foreign Nationals escort, the escort must coordinate with the Visitor Control Center.\n\nGATE HOURS\n\nAult Field -\n\nCharles Porter Gate: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nLangley Gate: 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday thru Friday\n\nSaratoga/Hospital Gate: Closed\n\nHammer/Nortz Gate: 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. automated after 8:30 a.m. (contact the Vehicle Control Center on Langley Blvd for more details), Monday thru Friday\n\nSeaplane Base –\n\nTorpedo Gate: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week\n\nMaui Gate: 6:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday; 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. weekends/holidays\n\nBASE ACCESS CONTROL\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) affiliated personnel are authorized access to the installation upon presentation of their DoD issued:\n\n• Common Access Card (CAC)\n\n• DD Form 2 (Retired)\n\n• DD Form 1173 (family member)\n\n• DD Form 1173-1 (Guard/Reserve family member)\n\n• DD Form 2765 (Privilege Card)\n\n• Defense Biometrics Identification System (DBIDS) identification card\n\nPersons without a DoD ID card are not allowed entry to NASWI unless they have met entry requirements in accordance with DoD and Navy regulations. NASWI Entry Control Points (gates) are manned by Navy Security Forces military and civilian personnel.\n\nThe requirement for base access for all non-affiliated, unescorted contractor, sub-contractors, service providers, and visitors is to complete and submit SECNAV Form 5512/1: Base Access Pass Registration (found under \"ACCESS CONTROL FORMS\") via their sponsor. This policy is effective for all events, including one-time events, such as weddings, retirement ceremonies, public affairs functions, changes of command, special events, job applicants, and for vendors/service providers not enrolled in DBIDS, Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) holders without a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC), and civilian retiree cardholders prior to Personnel Support Detachment (PSD) reissuance of expired credentials.\n\nDBIDS Enrollment:\n\nThe DBIDS enrollment site was designed to help expedite processing time before entering a government installation. Upon completion of enrollment, print the QR Code Confirmation page, save as a .PDF and or write down the alpha-numeric code below and bring it with you along with two valid forms of ID. You will required to complete SECNAV Form 5512/1 for criminal background check vetting OR have the non-affiliated guest pre-enroll at the following website: https://dbids-global-enroll.dmdc.mil/preenrollui/#!/ and provide the DBIDS pre-enrollment generated access code to installation sponsor or the Visitor Control Center clerk facilitate the vetting for installation access of non-affiliated personnel.\n\nSPONSORSHIP\n\nSponsorship allows authorized ID cardholders to take responsibility for verifying and authorizing up to five (5) non-affiliated personnel in the same vehicle for access onto NASWI. If requested, all non-affiliated personnel must be able to present a valid government issued photo identification. Capability is dependent upon current Force Protection Conditions.\n\nAuthorized ID cardholders include:\n\n- Active duty service members and their family members\n\n- DoD Civil Service Employees\n\n- Retired military and DoD civilians\n\n(Dependents and family members must be over the age of 18)\n\nSponsors accept full responsibility for those they are escorting, and must remain with them at all times until they leave the base.\n\nActive duty and DoD civilian personnel are not authorized to escort foreign nationals onto the installation without prior screening. As directed by USNAVNORTH, all foreign national guests must be properly approved, vetted and logged in at the Visitor Control Center prior to access authorization. Sponsors escorting non-U.S. citizens must come into the VCC with the individual(s) to fill out a Foreign National Application for the background check of the individual(s). The Foreign National Application process may take up to 30 days to process. Please see the requirements for background checks below. Entry into secure areas on NASWI, including operational areas require additional steps prior to receiving access to these areas.\n\nAll non-sponsored non-affiliated visitors are required to process at a VCC to obtain a temporary visitor pass. They must provide a valid reason for entry to NASWI, and will be subjected to security vetting.\n\nGuests over the age of 18 are required to have valid government issued photo identification on their person at all times while on the installation.\n\nAll guests must have a valid request in the system for base admittance. Typically, these requests are placed through the Base Authorization and Visit Request (BAVR) Web page. All non-sponsored guests who do not possess a CAC must undergo a background check for local, state, and federal criminal history records.\n\nThe Installation Commanding Officer may revoke or suspend the visitor’s base access privilege at any time. Upon expiration of NASWI credentials, or termination or resignation of employment, return NASWI credentials to VCC in person, or hand over to NASWI Navy Security Force personnel. These credentials are property of the federal government and will not be returned to the company/organization nor handed over to a company/organization supervisor.\n\nREQUIRED DOCUMENTS\n\nIn order to be vetted with a background check and identify proofing by VCC personnel, you must bring valid/current government issued photo identification and current proof of citizenship. This applies to all individuals except for active duty service members and federal civilian employees, who do not require the same background checks. Despite having a CAC, these individuals are highly encouraged to bring any of the following proofs of citizenship (**while your Social Security card is helpful for identity proofing, it is NOT a valid proof of citizenship for NASWI vetting purposes**):\n\nState issued birth certificate: This must be an original or state certified copy. Personal photocopies, electronic versions, or hospital issued birth records are NOT accepted.\n\nValid Real ID Enhanced state-issued driver's license.\n\nU.S. Passport (book or card): The passport can NOT CANNOT be expired.(or MUST BE CURRENT.)\n\nCertification of Naturalization: This document (FS-550/560) must be an original; electronic or photocopies are not accepted.\n\nBorn-abroad Certificate: This document (FS-240) must be an original. Electronic or photocopies are not accepted.\n\nPermanent Resident Card: This allows background checks to be performed and access to the common area upon favorable results. However, Permanent Resident Cards do NOT qualify for proof of citizenship for restricted area access.\n\nDELIVERIES AND PICK UPS\n\nIndividuals making deliveries or picking up loads on NASWI installations must have valid government issued photo identification, proof of citizenship, and a Bill of Lading (hard copy only) in order to be vetted by the VCC and receive a temporary pass. See Required Documents above for acceptable proof of citizenship. After receiving a favorable background check by VCC personnel, delivery drivers will be issued a temporary pass. It is up to the driver or their company to coordinate sponsorship and the delivery arrangements. VCC personnel will not arrange for a sponsor. It is important to note that these sponsors are not contractors.\n\nPersonnel in possession of a valid TWIC are considered identity proofed but not vetted for the purpose of installation access. Drivers must be vetted inside the VCC with a favorable background check and sponsor. Drivers must have their TWIC, Bill of Lading (hard copy only), and proof of citizenship. If they are entering a restricted area, they must have the above items and a government sponsor for access into the restricted area. Once again, it is on the driver or their organization to make these arrangements.\n\nVCC LOCATION & SERVICES\n\nNAS Whidbey Island (Ault Field, Seaplane Base, OLF Coupeville)\n\nBldg. 2853 (located near Langley Gate)\n\n(360) 257-5620\n\n· Turnstile/Enrollment: Given for restricted area access to Ault Field and Flightline with valid/current credentials and permissions in the system.
