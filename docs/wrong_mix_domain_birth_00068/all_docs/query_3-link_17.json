        "text": "(born 1973). American rapper and songwriter Nas became a dominant voice in 1990s East Coast hip-hop. Nas built a reputation as an expressive recorder of inner-city street life.\n\nNasir bin Olu Dara Jones, the son of a jazz musician, was born on September 14, 1973, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in public housing in Queens, New York. After he dropped out of school in the eighth grade, he began searching for a creative outlet, which he found in hip-hop. His breakthrough came in 1992, when his song “Half Time” (credited to Nasty Nas) appeared on the sound track to the film Zebrahead. Columbia Records soon signed him to a contract. Illmatic (1994), his debut recording as Nas, drew widespread acclaim for its poetic narration of hard-edged inner-city life.\n\nThe more pop-oriented approach of It Was Written (1996) helped that album reach an even wider audience than its predecessor, However, its release also marked a recurring tension in Nas’s career between balancing the demands of the pop audience with those of hip-hop purists. He maintained his commercial appeal with I Am... (1999), although by that time he had also become embroiled in a public feud with fellow rapper Jay-Z over which of the two was the preeminent voice in East Coast hip-hop. The schism inspired Stillmatic (2001), which many fans considered a return to pure hip-hop. The two rappers publicly settled their differences in 2005, and shortly thereafter Nas signed with Def Jam, of which Jay-Z was president at the time.\n\nNas continued to record albums, including Hip Hop Is Dead (2006), an untitled follow-up in 2008, and Life Is Good (2012). He also notably collaborated with reggae musician Damian Marley (the youngest son of Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley) on the album Distant Relatives (2010). Nas’s later albums included Nasir (2018), which Kanye West produced, and King’s Disease (2020). Nas won a 2020 Grammy Award for best rap album for King’s Disease."
