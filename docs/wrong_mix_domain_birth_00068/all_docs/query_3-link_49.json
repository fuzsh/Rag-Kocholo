        "text": "Nas is a popular American rapper and entrepreneur. Regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop artists, he has released eight consecutive platinum and multi-platinum albums, selling over 25 million records worldwide. Like his debut album ‘Illmatic,’ almost all of his albums are acclaimed “piece of perfection” and accepted as “classic works.” While ‘Billboard’ has named him among the ‘10 Best Rappers,’ ‘About.com’ has ranked him first in the list of top ‘50 Greatest MCs’ for two consecutive years. He has been acknowledged for his ability to create magic with lyrics and music. While MTV has honored him by ranking him fourth on its ‘Hottest MCs’ list, ‘The Source’ magazine has ranked him second on its list of ‘Top 50 Lyricists.’ Writer Adam Bradley has stated in his book ‘Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop’ that Nas is contemporary rap's greatest innovator. Nas is also a brilliant entrepreneur and has invested in several startups ranging from online retail to technology, and from job placement to restaurants. He has also invested in ‘Mass Appeal’ magazine and serves as its associate publisher. He has his own sneaker store and clothing line as well."
