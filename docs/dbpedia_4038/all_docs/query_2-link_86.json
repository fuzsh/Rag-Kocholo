        "text": "Comparative thermometry on pelitic rocks and marbles of the Llano uplift, Texas\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLetargo, C.M.R.; Lamb, W.M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe Llano Uplift in central Texas is a Grenville-aged metamorphic complex consisting of amphibolite facies assemblages whose development has been attributed to the emplacement of granite plutons between 1.0--1.1 Ga. Temperatures have been obtained from garnet-biotite, garnet-ilmenite, and calcite-dolomite pairs as well as from various silicate equilibria. Application of these geothermometers yield consistent results and are thus indicative of peak conditions attending the amphibolite facies metamorphism. Temperature determined using garnet-biotite and garnet-ilmenite thermometry compare favorably with calcite-dolomite temperatures obtained from marbles in contact with granite plutons in the southeastern part of the uplift. The highest calcite-dolomite temperatures of [approximately]600 CmoreÂ Â» are obtained from marbles containing an isobarically invariant assemblage consisting of calcite + dolomite + diopside + tremolite + forsterite. At pressures of 2--3 kbar, this isobarically invariant assemblage will be stable at a temperature range of [approximately]600--650 C. Also in close proximity to granites in the southeast uplift is the assemblage muscovite + quartz + k-feldspar + sillimanite [approximately] andalusite which indicate T 650 C and P 2.5 kbar. Assemblages consisting of garnet + sillimanite + quartz + plagioclase (GASP) and garnet + rutile + ilmenite + plagioclase + quartz (GRIPS) are currently being studied to provide additional constraints on pressures of amphibolite facies metamorphism.Â«Â less\n\nPetrogenesis of Mesoproterozoic granitic plutons, eastern Llano Uplift, central Texas, USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmith, R. K.; Gray, Walt; Gibbs, Tyson; Gallegos, M. A.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nThe Llano Uplift of central Texas is a gentle structural dome exposing Ë 1370 to 1230 Ma metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks of Grenville affinity along the southern margin of Laurentia. The metamorphic rocks were subsequently intruded by Ë 1119 to 1070 Ma late syn- to post-tectonic granites collectively known as the Town Mountain Granite (TMG). The eastern most of the TMG, the Marble Falls (MF), Kingsland (KL), and Lone Grove (LG) plutons, are metaluminous to marginally peraluminous, high-K, calc-alkaline, ferroan, biotite-calcic amphibole granites [Fe/(Fe + Mg) = 0.71-0.92 and 0.78-0.91 for biotite and calcic amphibole, respectively] displaying distinct variation trends with increasing silica content. They are chemically and texturally zoned and have mineralogical and chemical characteristics similar to A-type granites; i.e., 1) Fe-rich biotites, calcic amphiboles, accessory fluorite, and sporadic rapakivi texture, 2) high K 2O (> 4 wt.%), 3) low Al 2O 3 (< 16 wt.%) and CaO (< 3 wt.%), 4) high Fe/(Fe + Mg), 5) enrichments in Zr, Nb, REE, Ga/Al, and 6) depleted Eu. However, in contrast to typical A-type granites (having low Sr and Ba) the MF, KL,and LG plutons are enriched in Sr and Ba; i.e., up to 229 ppm and 1090 ppm, respectively. On granite discrimination diagrams [(K 2O + Na 2O)/CaO vs. Zr + Nb + Ce + Y (ppm) and Zr (ppm) vs. Ga/Al*10,000] the KL and MF plutons plot within the A-type field, whereas the LG pluton compositions are divided between A-type and fractionated granite fields (I-, S- and M-types). On tectonic discrimination diagrams (Y vs. Nb ) the MF and KL granites plot in the \"within-plate\" granite field, but the LG pluton plots across several fields including \"within-plate\" and \"volcanic arc plus syn-collisional\" fields. Consequently the tectonic classification on a geochemical basis for the LG pluton is unclear. Based on thermal metamorphic mineral assemblages, normative Q-Ab-Or plots, and Q-Ab-Or-H 2O experimental data (Johannes and Holtz\n\nThe Grenville orogeny in the Llano Uplift, Texas: A record of collision and contraction along the southern margin of North America\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nReese, J.F.\n\n1993-02-01\n\nPrecambrian metamorphic rocks in the SE Llano Uplift record NE-directed ductile thrusting and regional-scale polyphase folding. This deformation is in response to Grenville-age shortening and crustal thickening associated with the collision of a south-lying tectonic block with the southern margin of North America. In the SE Llano Uplift, the most intense and pervasive deformational event, D2, is characterized in the Packsaddle Schist (PS) and Valley Spring Gneiss (VSG) by SSE-plunging, NE-verging isoclinal folds (F2) with an associated SW-dipping axial planar metamorphic layering (S2), and SW-dipping mylonite zones with kinematic indicators showing top-to-the-NE motion. In the Red Mountain and augen-bearing BigmoreÂ Â» Branch gneisses, D2 structures are SW-dipping mylonite zones parallel to S2, and a SW-plunging stretching lineation. Taken together, this suite of structures indicates tectonic transport was to the NE, perpendicular to the NW trending regional structural and metamorphic grain. D2 structures were reoriented by at least two later phases of folding. Timing of all ductile deformation in the SE Llano Uplift is constrained from post-1,215 Ma (deformed PS) to pre-1,098 Ma (undeformed melarhyolite dike). From south to north, metatonalitic, arc-derived Big Branch Gneiss ([approximately] 1,303 Ma) and older mafic schist country rock, previously interpreted as possible ophiolitic melange, structurally overlie much younger, lithologically heterogeneous PS units (1,248-1,215 Ma), previously considered as arc flank deposits. In turn, the PS has been tectonically emplaced above the predominantly felsic VSG (1,270-1,232 Ma). The presence of older zircons in the VSG, of similar age ([approximately]1360 Ma) to Western Granite-Rhyolite Terrane rocks to the north, suggests that the VSG formed in a settling proximal to North America.Â«Â less\n\n76 FR 67397 - Radio Broadcasting Services; Llano, Texas\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-11-01\n\n...] Radio Broadcasting Services; Llano, Texas AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.

W.; Stockli, D. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Devils River Uplift (DRU) in SW Texas records the evolution of the southern Laurentian margin from Grenvillian orogenesis and assembly of Rodinia, to its fragmentation by rifting, and to the amalgamation of Pangaea. It was cored by a well (Shell No. 1 Stewart), penetrating Precambrian gneisses and Cambrian metasediments and sandstones. New zircon LA-ICP-MS data from a total of 10 samples elucidate the crystallization and depositional ages, as well as the detrital provenance, of Precambrian and Cambrian rocks from the DRU. Zircons from five Precambrian crystalline basement samples (6000-9693') yield uniform U-Pb crystallization ages of 1230 Ma that are similar to ages for young gneisses of the Valley Spring Domain (Llano uplift) in central Texas, where they mark the cessation of arc magmatism within the Grenville orogenic belt. The 1230 Ma igneous basement is overlain by L.-M. Cambrian metasedimentary rocks ( 4000-6000') with maximum depositional ages of 533-545 Ma. Detrital zircons from Cambrian strata are dominated by a 1070-1080 Ma population, likely derived from basement units exposed in Texas (Llano uplift, Franklin Mts.), with minor contributions from local 1230 Ma Precambrian basement and the 1380-1500 Ma Granite Rhyolite Province. The L.-M. Cambrian interval is dominated (>80%) by Neoproterozoic detrital magmatic zircons with two major distinct age clusters at 570-700 Ma and 780-820 Ma, supporting a two-stage Rodinia rift model and providing strong evidence for major Cryogenian-Eocambrian intraplate magmatism along the southern margin of Rodinia. Moreover, detrital zircon signatures for L.-M. and U. Cambrian strata strongly correlate with those from the Cuyania terrane of W. Argentina - notably the W. Sierras Pampeanas (Sa. Pie de Palo, Sa. de Maz): 1230 Ma from metasandstones (PdP); 1081-1038 Ma from metasiliciclastics (PdP, SdM); Cryogenian-Eocambrian [774 & 570 Ma] plutons (SdM, PdP). In summary, these new zircon U-Pb data from DRU in SW Texas show\n\nInvestigation of the lithosphere of the Texas Gulf Coast using phase-specific Ps receiver functions produced by wavefield iterative deconvolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGurrola, H.; Berdine, A.; Pulliam, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nInterference between Ps phases and reverberations (PPs, PSs phases and reverberations thereof) make it difficult to use Ps receiver functions (RF) in regions with thick sediments. Crustal reverberations typically interfere with Ps phases from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). We have developed a method to separate Ps phases from reverberations by deconvolution of all the data recorded at a seismic station by removing phases from a single wavefront at each iteration of the deconvolution (wavefield iterative deconvolution or WID). We applied WID to data collected in the Gulf Coast and Llano Front regions of Texas by the EarthScope Transportable array and by a temporary deployment of 23 broadband seismometers (deployed by Texas Tech and Baylor Universities). The 23 station temporary deployment was 300 km long; crossing from Matagorda Island onto the Llano uplift. 3-D imaging using these data shows that the deepest part of the sedimentary basin may be inboard of the coastline. The Moho beneath the Gulf Coast plain does not appear in many of the images. This could be due to interference from reverberations from shallower layers or it may indicate the lack of a strong velocity contrast at the Moho perhaps due to serpentinization of the uppermost mantle. The Moho appears to be flat, at 40 km) beneath most of the Llano uplift but may thicken to the south and thin beneath the Coastal plain. After application of WID, we were able to identify a negatively polarized Ps phase consistent with LAB depths identified in Sp RF images. The LAB appears to be 80-100 km deep beneath most of the coast but is 100 to 120 km deep beneath the Llano uplift. There are other negatively polarized phases between 160 and 200 km depths beneath the Gulf Coast and the Llano Uplift. These deeper phases may indicate that, in this region, the LAB is transitional in nature and rather than a discrete boundary.\n\nShear Wave Structure in the Lithosphere of Texas from Ambient Noise Tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYao, Y.; Li, A.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nTexas contains several distinct tectonic provinces, the Laurentia craton, the Ouachita belt, and the Gulf coastal plain. Although numerous geophysical experiments have been conducted in Texas for petroleum exploration, the lithosphere structure of Texas has not been well studied. We present here the Texas-wide shear wave structure using seismic ambient noise data recorded at 87 stations from the Transportable Array of the USArray between March 2010 and February 2011. Rayleigh wave phase velocities between pairs of stations are obtained by cross-correlating long ambient noise sequences and are used to develop phase velocity maps from 6 to 40 s. These measured phase velocities are used to construct 1-D and 3-D shear wave velocity models, which consist of four crust layers and one upper mantle layer. Shear wave velocity maps reveal a close correlation with major geological features. From the surface to 25 km depth, Positive anomalies coincide with the Laurentia craton, and negative anomalies coincide with the continental margin. The boundary of positive-negative anomaly perfectly matches the Ouachita belt. The Llano Uplift is imaged as the highest velocity through the mid-crust because the igneous rock forming the uplift has faster seismic velocity than the normal continental crust. Similarly, three small high-velocity areas exist beneath the Waco Uplift, Devils River Uplift, and Benton Uplift, even though surface geological traces are absent in these areas. The lowest velocity at the shallow crust appears in northeastern and southeastern Texas separated by the San Marcos Arch, correlating with thick sediment layers. An exceptional low velocity is imaged in southernmost Texas in the lower crust and upper mantle, probably caused by subducted wet oceanic crust before the rifting in the Gulf of Mexico. In the uppermost mantle, positive shear wave anomalies extend southeastward from the Ouachita belt to the Gulf coast, likely evidencing the subducted oceanic lithosphere\n\nWilcox group (Paleocene to Eocene) coals of the Sabine Uplift area, Texas and Louisiana\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHook, Robert W.; Warwick, Peter D.; SanFilipo, John R.; Warwick, Peter D.; Karlsen, Alexander K.; Merrill, Matthew D.; Valentine, Brett J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Wilcox Group (Paleocene to Eocene) of the Sabine uplift, a structural arch in northeastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana (Figure 1), has lignite zones that approach subbituminous rank (see Chapter 4, this publication). These coals are among the highest quality resources known within the Gulf Coastal Plain because of their low ash yield and sulfur content. The surface expression of the Sabine uplift is defined by the contact between coal-bearing rocks of the Wilcox Group and overlying fluvial rocks of the Carrizo Sand, which is the basal unit of the Claiborne Group (Figures 2, 3). The Sabine uplift study area includes parts of Harrison, Marion, Nacogdoches, Panola, Rusk, Sabine, San Augustine, and Shelby Counties in Texas and Bossier, Caddo, De Soto, Natchitoches, Red River, and Sabine Parishes in Louisiana (Figure 1). Adjacent counties and parishes that include the subsurface Wilcox Group extend the regional Sabine uplift area. The Wilcox in the subsurface is underlain by the Midway Group (Figure 3), a mudstone-dominated marine sequence of Paleocene age. Quaternary alluvium and terrace deposits overlying the Wilcox Group at the surface are limited to areas of modern drainage.The total thickness of the Wilcox Group within the Sabine uplift area ranges from approximately 400 ft on outcrop to 2500 ft in subsurface (Kaiser, 1990). In a few places, the contact between the overlying Carrizo Sand and Wilcox Group is erosional, but in other places, the contact is gradational.\n\nA Broadband Investigation of the Texas/Gulf of Mexico Passive Margin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEvanzia, D.; Ainsworth, R.; Pratt, K. W.; Pulliam, J.; Gurrola, H.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe lithosphere of central and east Texas underwent two cycles of continental rifting and orogeny from the formation of Laurentia and assembly through the breakup of Pangea. The craton itself, exposed in the Llano uplift of central Texas, formed ~1.4 Ga as part of the great expanse of Mesoproterozoic crust that makes up southern Laurentia. Some of this crust was deformed during the Grenville orogeny ~1.1 Ga. Southern Laurentia was subsequently stable until rifting began in Cambrian time (~530 Ma). Suturing of Gondwana to Laurentia (310-290 Ma) during the assembly of Pangea formed the Ouachita orogen in west Texas. Sometime before 200 Ma rifting was initiated, opening the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). In north and east Texas the Ouachita front lies north of GoM rifting but, according to deep seismic data, Ouachita structures appear to coincide with GoM rifting in south and central Texas. This suggests that rifting in that region occurred along structures that were weakened previously by Ouachita deformation and reactivated during the Jurassic opening of the GoM. It is not clear whether the process that created the Gulf of Mexico and led to the formation of Texas' Gulf Coast Plain (GCP) is best described as \"active\" or \"passive\" rifting. A recent study interpreted the GCP to be a volcanic rifted marginâan active rifting processâusing available gravity, magnetic, drilling and geological data, but older studies describe the opening of the GoM as a passive event. In the coastal plain, a large magnetic anomaly suggests that the crust here was modified by volcanism. Seismic data are sparse and of limited quality in the Gulf Coast region so we conducted a 2.5-year broadband seismograph transect across the GCP in an effort to clarify its structure and origin. In all, twenty-three broadband seismographs were deployed in a line from Matagorda Island, in the Gulf of Mexico, to Johnson City, TX, on the uplifted Llano Plateau from July 2010 to December 2012. These seismographs have\n\nSurface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas.\n\nPubMed\n\nShirzaei, Manoochehr; Ellsworth, William L; Tiampo, Kristy F; GonzÃ¡lez, Pablo J; Manga, Michael\n\n2016-09-23\n\nObservations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8-moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement rocks.

The Arroyo Colorado flows through areas of intense agricultural cultivation and through important habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife, including several wildlife sanctuaries and refuges. The above-tidal segment of the Arroyo Colorado is included in the State of Texas 2000 Clean Water Act 303(d)1 list in part because of elevated concentrations of the hydrophobic legacy pollutants DDE (a DDT breakdown product), chlordane, and toxaphene in fish tissue. This report addresses three questions: Do legacy pollutants (organochlorine compounds, major and trace elements) occur in the Arroyo Colorado at present and at what concentrations?How has the occurrence of selected legacy pollutants in the Arroyo Colorado changed over time?Are current concentrations of legacy pollutants in bottom sediments at levels of concern for the health of aquatic biota?To answer these questions, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), collected and analyzed a sediment core from Llano Grande Lake on the Arroyo Colorado (fig. 1). Sediment cores can be used to reconstruct historical trends in concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants (Eisenreich and others, 1989; Van Metre and others, 1997, 2000). The lake is part of the Rio Grande delta drainage system (fig. 1). The lake is 6 miles long and has a maximum width of 600 feet.\n\nCrustal wavespeed structure of North Texas and Oklahoma based on ambient noise cross-correlation functions and adjoint tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRecently, seismologists observed increasing seismicity in North Texas and Oklahoma. Based on seismic observations and other geophysical measurements, some studies suggested possible links between the increasing seismicity and wastewater injection during unconventional oil and gas exploration. To better monitor seismic events and investigate their mechanisms, we need an accurate 3D crustal wavespeed model for North Texas and Oklahoma. Considering the uneven distribution of earthquakes in this region, seismic tomography with local earthquake records have difficulties to achieve good illumination. To overcome this limitation, in this study, ambient noise cross-correlation functions are used to constrain subsurface variations in wavespeeds. I use adjoint tomography to iteratively fit frequency-dependent phase differences between observed and predicted band-limited Green's functions. The spectral-element method is used to numerically calculate the band-limited Green's functions and the adjoint method is used to calculate misfit gradients with respect to wavespeeds. 25 preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations are used to update model parameters and minimize data misfits. Features in the new crustal model M25 correlates with geological units in the study region, including the Llano uplift, the Anadarko basin and the Ouachita orogenic front. In addition, these seismic anomalies correlate with gravity and magnetic observations. This new model can be used to better constrain earthquake source parameters in North Texas and Oklahoma, such as epicenter location and moment tensor solutions, which are important for investigating potential relations between seismicity and unconventional oil and gas exploration.\n\nMapping the Llano Estacado\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nEarly maps of North America, prepared in the 18th and early 19th centuries, often depicted the Llano Estacado as a conspicuous blank spot - a terra incognita.

However, little information exists on the raptor community of the region. We conducted raptor surveys in the Southwestern and Western Llanos during 2000-02 and detected 28 species representing 19 genera. Overall, areas of the Llanos that we sampled contained 52% of all raptor species and more than 70% of the kites, buteos, and subbuteos known to inhabit Venezuela. Regional differences in the mean number per route for four of the 14 most common species, the Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus), Black-collared Hawk (Busarellus nigricollis), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), were significant (P < 0.0018) in relation to the wet or dry seasons. Of the 14 less common species, six were detected in only one season (wet or dry). The Southwestern and Western regions of the Llanos support a rich raptor community composed primarily of nonmigratory wetland-dependent and upland-terrestrial species. ?? 2005 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.\n\nReceiver function analysis of the Texas Gulf Coast to better understand the Ouachita Orogeny, opening of the Gulf of Mexico, and current state of the southern margin of North America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKnuppel, M.; Pratt, K. W.; Evanzia, D.; Gurrola, H.; Pulliam, J.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFor the past two years, Texas Tech and Baylor universities have been operating 21 broadband seismic stations extending from Matagorda Island, crossing the Gulf Coast plain and Balcones fault, ending in the middle of the Llano Uplift at Johnson City, Texas. The goal of this project is to image the basement to better understand the opening of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the stabilization of the southern lithosphere of North America. In this presentation we will present preliminary results of receiver function analysis of data recorded by our broadband array. Using 18 months' of data we performed common conversion point (CCP) stack imaging of the crust and lithosphere along the profile and have produced a cross section showing receiver function derived Vp/Vs ratios along the profile. The strongest phase on the CCP stack is the Ps phase from the base of a 15 to 20-km-deep (at the shoreline) sedimentary basin that shallows to approximately 1 km deep at the Balcones fault. Vp/Vs analysis shows that this sedimentary unit has Vp/Vs ratios between 1.9 and 2.0. This unusually high Vp/Vs ratio is consistent with the basin being dominated by poorly consolidated, relatively young clastic sediment. This layer pinches out to the northwest. No clear Ps phase is observed from base of the Mesozoic carbonates and Ouachita-related sediments that we believe is several kilometers thick, based on observed Vp/Vs ratios of 1.85 to 1.9 (which is more consistent with carbonate rock than granitic basement). The pattern of Vp/Vs implies near-vertical, crust-wide displacement along the Balcones Fault. The Moho appears to be 15 to 20 km deep near the ocean but descends to more than 40 km beneath the Llano uplift. There is a strong Ps phase from about 70 km depth near the coastline that we interpret as remnant depleted mantle from the rifting of the GOM. The region between this P70s phase and the Moho appear to have a low Vp/Vs ratio (~1.75), which would be consistent with mantle depleted in\n\nOil geochemistry of the northern Llanos Basin, Colombia. A model for migration\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRamon, J.C.; Dzou, L.\n\n1996-12-31\n\nThe chemical composition of 23 crude oils and one oil seep from Llanos Basin, Colombia were studied in detail by geochemical methods in order to understand their genetic relationship. A filling history model is proposed to explain the observed composition variations in Llanos Basin oils. Geochemical fingerprinting indicates that there are six families of crude oils. The biomarker compositions have been used to identify characteristics of the source rocks. The Llanos oils contain marine algal- derived {open_quotes}C30 steranes{close_quotes} (i.e., 24-n-propylcholestanes), which are diagnostic for oils generated from marine Cretaceous source rocks. A significant HC-contribution from a Tertiary source is alsomoreÂ Â» indicated by the presence of high concentration of the {open_quotes}flowering plant{close_quotes}-markers oleanane, bicadinanes and oleanoids. Low DBT/Phen, %sulfur values and high diasteranes concentration indicate that the source rock is clay-rich. Biomarker maturity parameters indicate a wide range of source-rock thermal maturities from early to late oil window. Heavy biodegradation has been particularly common among the first oils to fill reservoirs in central Llanos oil fields. The older altered heavy oils were mixed with a second pulse of oil explaining the wide range of oil gravities measured in the central Llanos Basin.Â«Â less\n\nDepositional systems and diagenesis of Travis Peak tight gas sandstone reservoirs, Sabine Uplift Area, Texas\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFracasso, M.A.; Dutton, S.P.; Finley, R.J.\n\nThe Travis Peak formation (lower Cretaceous) in the eastern East Texas basin is a fluvio-deltaic depositional system divided into large-scale facies packages: a middle sandstone-rich fluvial and delta-plain sequence that is gradationally overlain and underlain by a marine-influenced delta-fringe zone with a higher mudstone content. Domes and structural terraces on the west flank of the Sabine Uplift influenced deposition of Travis Peak sediments, and most Travis Peak gas production in this area is from thin sandstones (<25 ft(<7.6 m) thick) in the upper delta-fringe facies. The trapping mechanism is stratigraphic pinch-out of sandstones or porosity zones within sandstone, or both,moreÂ Â» on the flanks of structures. Detailed mapping of producing sandstone sequences in the uppermost upper delta-fringe on the western flank of the Bethany structure has delineated fluvial channelways, distributary or tidal channels, and barrier of distributary-mouth bars. Most Travis Peak gas production in the Bethany West area is from the bases of channel sandstones in a marine-influenced facies belt. Travis Peak sandstones in the eastern East Texas basin have undergone a complex series of diagenetic modifications. Precipitation of authigenic quartz, ankerite, dolomite, illite, and chlorite and the introduction of reservoir bitumen were the most important causes of occlusion of primary porosity and reduction of permeability. Permeability decreases with depth in the Travis Peak, which suggests that the diagenetic processes that caused extensive cementation and resultant low permeability throughout most of the formation operated less completely on sediments deposited near the top of the succession.Â«Â less\n\nLithologic and hydrologic controls of mixed alluvial-bedrock channels in flood-prone fluvial systems: bankfull and macrochannels in the Llano River watershed, central Texas, USA\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHeitmuller, Frank T.; Hudson, Paul F.; Asquith, William H.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe rural and unregulated Llano River watershed located in central Texas, USA, has a highly variable flow regime and a wide range of instantaneous peak flows. Abrupt transitions in surface lithology exist along the main-stem channel course. Both of these characteristics afford an opportunity to examine hydrologic, lithologic, and sedimentary controls on downstream changes in channel morphology. Field surveys of channel topography and boundary composition are coupled with sediment analyses, hydraulic computations, flood-frequency analyses, and geographic information system mapping to discern controls on channel geometry (profile, pattern, and shape) and dimensions along the mixed alluvial-bedrock Llano River and key tributaries. Four categories of channel classification in a downstream direction include: (i) uppermost ephemeral reaches, (ii) straight or sinuous gravel-bed channels in Cretaceous carbonate sedimentary zones, (iii) straight or sinuous gravel-bed or bedrock channels in Paleozoic sedimentary zones, and (iv) straight, braided, or multithread mixed alluvialâbedrock channels with sandy beds in Precambrian igneous and metamorphic zones. Principal findings include: (i) a nearly linear channel profile attributed to resistant bedrock incision checkpoints; (ii) statistically significant correlations of both alluvial sinuosity and valley confinement to relatively high f (mean depth) hydraulic geometry values; (iii) relatively high b (width) hydraulic geometry values in partly confined settings with sinuous channels upstream from a prominent incision checkpoint; (iv) different functional flow categories including frequently occurring events (< 1.5-year return periods) that mobilize channel-bed material and less frequent events that determine bankfull channel (1.5- to 3-year return periods) and macrochannel (10- to 40-year return periods) dimensions; (v) macrochannels with high f values (most â¤ 0.45) that develop at sites with unit stream power values in excess\n\nGrassland ecosystems of the Llano Estacado\n\nTreesearch\n\nEileen Johnson\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Llano Estacado, or Southern High Plains, has been a grassland throughout the Quaternary.

Based on seismic observations and other geophysical measurements, numerous studies suggested links between the increasing seismicity and wastewater injection during unconventional oil and gas exploration. To better monitor seismic events and investigate their triggering mechanisms, we need an accurate 3D crustal wavespeed model for the study region. Considering the uneven distribution of earthquakes in this area, seismic tomography with local earthquake records have difficulties achieving even illumination. To overcome this limitation, in this study, ambient noise cross-correlation functions are used to constrain subsurface variations in wavespeeds. I use adjoint tomography to iteratively fit frequency-dependent phase differences between observed and predicted band-limited Green's functions. The spectral-element method is used to numerically calculate the band-limited Green's functions and the adjoint method is used to calculate misfit gradients with respect to wavespeeds. Twenty five preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations are used to update model parameters and minimize data misfits. Features in the new crustal model TO25 correlates well with geological provinces in the study region, including the Llano uplift, the Anadarko basin and the Ouachita orogenic front, etc. In addition, there are relatively good correlations between seismic results with gravity and magnetic observations. This new crustal model can be used to better constrain earthquake source parameters in North Texas and Oklahoma, such as epicenter location as well as moment tensor solutions, which are important for investigating triggering mechanisms between these induced earthquakes and unconventional oil and gas exploration activities.\n\nPaleocene coal deposits of the Wilcox Group, Northeast Texas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHook, Robert W.; Warwick, Peter D.; SanFilipo, John R.; Nichols, Douglas J.; Swanson, Sharon M.; Warwick, Peter D.; Karlsen, Alexander K.; Merrill, Matthew D.; Valentine, Brett J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe surface exposure of the Paleocene Wilcox Group in northeast Texas varies in width from 9 to 27 mi along an arcuate outcrop that extends southwest approximately 156 mi from the Texas-Arkansas State line to 32Â° latitude. Parts of Bowie, Camp, Cass, Franklin, Henderson, Hopkins, Morris, Navarro, Rains, Titus, Van Zandt, and Wood Counties are included in this outcrop belt (Figure 1). This area forms the northwestern flank of the East Texas Basin (Figure 2), the axis of which separates northeast Texas from the Sabine uplift structural area. The Wilcox Group dips south and southeast at 2Â° or less toward the axis of the East Texas Basin, with the exception of local salt-dome structures and a transcurrent structural high that extends from Monticello to Martin Lake (Figure 1).\n\nCoal resources for part of the Wilcox group (Paleocene-Eocene), northeast Texas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWarwick, Peter D.; Aubourg, Claire E.; Podwysocki, Steven M.; Schultz, Adam C.; Warwick, Peter D.; Karlsen, Alexander K.; Merrill, Matthew D.; Valentine, Brett J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Wilcox Group of northeast Texas contains shallow (less than 500 ft) coal deposits that are mined for use in mine-mouth electric power generating plants. The coal deposits, which are lignite in apparent rank (Pierce et al., 2011), are separated from similar shallow coal deposits in the Sabine uplift area by the East Texas Basin (Figure 1). The coal zones and associated strata in the northeast assessment area generally dip to the south and southeast at 28 or less toward the axis of the East Texas Basin.

We present the first optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age constraints for dunes in the Llanos Orientales of lowland Colombia and new ages for dunes in the Venezuelan Llanos. The sampled dunes are fully vegetated and show evidence of post-depositional erosion. Ages range from 4.5 Â± 0.4 to 66 Â± 4 ka, with the majority dating to 27-10 ka (Marine Isotope Stage 2). Some dunes accumulated quickly during the last glacial maximum, although most were active 16-10 ka. Accretion largely ceased after 10 ka. All dunes are elongated downwind from rivers, parallel with dry season winds, and are interpreted as source-bordering features. As they are presently isolated from fluvial sediments by gallery forest it is proposed that activity was associated with a more prolonged dry season, which restricted gallery forest, leading to greater sediment availability on river shorelines. Such variability in dry season duration was potentially mediated by the mean latitude of the ITCZ. The cessation of most dune accretion after ca. 10 ka suggests reduced seasonality and a more northerly ITCZ position, consistent with evidence from the Cariaco Basin.\n\nGeology of natural gas reservoir: Upper Travis Peak Formation, western flank of Sabine Uplift, east Texas\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFracasso, M.A.\n\nThe Travis Peak Formation (Lower Cretaceous) in the eastern East Texas basin represents a sand-rich, fluvial-deltaic depositional system. This lobate, high-constructive deltaic system prograded radially to the southeast from an Upshur County locus. Regional studies of the Travis Peak established a threefold internal stratigraphic framework: a middle sand-rich fluvial and delta-plain sequence is gradationally overlain and underlain by a marine-influenced delta-fringe zone with a higher mud content. The entire Travis Peak succession thins over the Bethany dome on the western flank of the Sabine uplift. However, the delta-fringe sequences are relatively thicker over the structure because of a disproportionately greatermoreÂ Â» thinning of the middle sandy fluvial-deltaic sequence. Lesser sand deposition over the Bethany dome reflects an active structural control over facies distribution. Gas production in the Bethany field and surrounding area is concentrated in thin zones (5-15 ft) of the upper delta-fringe sequence. This distribution probably reflects the increased abundance of mudstone beds in the upper delta-fringe interval, which may have served as source rocks or barriers to upward gas migration, or as both. The predominant trapping mechanism in this region is stratigraphic sand pinch-out in a structurally updip direction on the flanks of major structures. Studies of core and closely spaced electric logs west of the Bethany dome help define the depositional systems in the upper delta-fringe producing interval. This sequence comprises a complex mosaic of continental and marine facies, and exhibits an overall upward trend of increasing marine influence that spans a gradual transition into transgressive carbonates of the Sligo Formation.Â«Â less\n\nAerial gamma ray and magnetic survey: Nebraska/Texas survey, Tyler quadrangle of Texas and Louisiana.

South Texas Wilcox and Indio coals have not been extensively mined, nor have they been mined commercially for at least the past 60 years. These coals constitute only about 1 percent of the demonstrated coal resources within the Texas Gulf Coastal Province. In contrast to the Wilcox coal resources of the assessed areas of the Sabine uplift of Texas and Louisiana, and of northeast Texas and central Texas (see Warwick et al., 2011a, b, c), Wilcox and Indio coal beds of south Texas are few in number, each generally less than 5 ft thick, and highly discontinuous. Furthermore, analytical data indicate that the sulfur content and ash yields of south Texas Wilcox and Indio coals generally exceed those of other Texas coals. Although these and other factors preclude the likely development of Wilcox or Indio coal resources in the near future, the comparatively elevated rank of these deposits has attracted recent interests related to coalbed methane production (SanFilipo, 1999; Warwick et al., 2002a, 2007b).\n\nMammalian wildlife diseases as hazards to man and livestock in an area of the Llanos Orientales of Colombia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWells, E A; D'Alessandro, A; Morales, G A; Angel, D\n\n1981-01-01\n\nDevelopment of the LLanos Orientales of Colombia, and access to underdeveloped areas in the Llanos, may create disease hazards to man and domestic animals or introduce exotic pathogens, creating reservoirs of infection for domestic animals and acting as limiting factors on the native wild species. A survey of wild animals common to the Llanos revealed a number of parasites indigenous to the area. A total total of 59 mammalian species, representing eight orders were examined. Haematozoa were represented by Trypanosoma cruzi, T. evansi and T. rangeli. Eight species of ticks were found: Amblyomma cajennense, A. auricularium, A. rotundatum, A. maculatum, A. longirostre, A. pacae, Ixodes luciae and Boophilus microplus. Four species of fleas were found: Rhopalopsyllus lugubris lugubris, R. australis tupinus, R. cacicus saevus and Polygenis klagesi samuelis. A species of Echinococcus was commonly found in Cuniculus paca. Serologic titers and/or isolations of pathogenic viral and bacterial agents generally indicated that the wildlife population had not been exposed to the diseases common to the domestic population. A low prevalence of titers to Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis was found in Cebus apella and Proechimys sp. Neutralizing antibodies to Group B viruses were found in Proechimys sp., Coendor sp. and Nectomys squamipes. Antibodies to Group C viruses were found in Proechimys sp. Serologic titers to Leptospira sejroe and L. tarassovi were found in Proechimys sp. and Didelphis marsupialis. L. tarassovi was isolated from Proechimys sp. Titers to Brucella were not found in 1964 animals. The significance of these findings are discussed.\n\nMode and mechanisms of plateau uplifts\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcgetchin, T. R.; Burke, K. C.; Thompson, G. A.; Young, R. A.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe mode and mechanisms of plateau uplifts are reported, based on discussions which occurred as part of a conference on plateau uplifts sponsored by the Inter-Union Commission on Geodynamics and the Lunar and Planetary Institute. Major plateaus and high plains of the world are discussed with emphasis on the Colorado Plateau, which possesses a shield-like crust 45 km thick and occupies most of eastern Utah and parts of Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Several uplift mechanisms are described, including thermal expansion due to a deep mantle plume or hot spot, and hydration reactions such as serpentinization. It is concluded that uplifts are most commonly associated with either subduction and its direct effects, or deep-seated thermal disturbances.\n\nAseismic uplift in California\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCastle, Robert O.; Elliot, Michael R.; Gilmore, Thomas D.; Mark, Robert K.; Newman, Evelyn B.; Tinsley, John C.; Jackson, D.D.; Lee, W.B.; Liu, C.-C.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nWe disagree with several of the arguments cited by Jackson et al. in support of their view that \"the inference of wide-spread aseismic uplift in southern California is not justified\" (1). Specifically, the striking correlation shown in figure 1 of Jackson et al.

From 2006 to 2009 the uplift rate slowed. Global Positioning System (GPS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) ground deformation measurements described by Chang et al. show that in the northern caldera, uplift decreased from 7 centimeters per year in 2006 to 5 in 2008 and 2 in 2009. In the southwestern portion of the caldera, uplift decreased from 4 centimeters per year in 2006 to 2 in 2008 and 0.5 in 2009, demonstrating a spatial pattern of ground motion decrease from southwest to northeast along the caldera.

C.; Blewitt, G.; Kreemer, C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nRecent improvements in the scope and precision of GPS networks across California and Nevada have allowed for uplift of the Sierra Nevada to be observed directly. Much of the signal, in the range of 1 to 2 mm/yr, has been attributed to lithospheric scale rebound following massive groundwater withdrawal in the San Joaquin Valley in southern California, exacerbated by drought since 2011. However, natural tectonic deformation associated with long term uplift of the range may also contribute to the observed signal. We have developed new algorithms that enhance the signal of Sierra Nevada uplift and improve our ability to interpret and separate natural tectonic signals from anthropogenic contributions. We apply our new Median Interannual Difference Adjusted for Skewness (MIDAS) algorithm to the vertical times series and a inverse distance-weighted median spatial filtering and Delaunay-based interpolation to despeckle the rate map. The resulting spatially continuous vertical rate field is insensitive to outliers and steps in the GPS time series, and omits isolated features attributable to unstable stations or unrepresentative rates. The resulting vertical rate field for California and Nevada exhibits regionally coherent signals from the earthquake cycle including interseismic strain accumulation in Cascadia, postseismic relaxation of the mantle from recent large earthquakes in central Nevada and southern California, groundwater loading changes, and tectonic uplift of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges. Uplift of the Sierra Nevada extends from the Garlock Fault in the south to an indefinite boundary in the north near the latitude of Mt. Lassen to the eastern Sierra Nevada range front in Owen's Valley. The rates transition to near zero in the southern Walker Lane. The eastern boundary of uplift coincides with the highest strain rates in the western Great Basin, suggesting higher normal fault slip rates and a component of tectonic uplift of the Sierra Nevada.\n\nGlacial isostatic uplift of the European Alps\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMey, JÃ¼rgen; Scherler, Dirk; Wickert, Andrew D.; Egholm, David L.; Tesauro, Magdala; Schildgen, Taylor F.; Strecker, Manfred R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFollowing the last glacial maximum (LGM), the demise of continental ice sheets induced crustal rebound in tectonically stable regions of North America and Scandinavia that is still ongoing.

M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis study determines the rates of subsidence or uplift in coastal areas of SE Texas by comparing recent GNSS measurements to the original orthometric heights of previously installed National Geodetic Survey (NGS) benchmarks. Understanding subsidence rates in coastal areas of SE Texas is critical when determining its vulnerability to local sea level rise and flooding, as well as for accurate survey control. The study area includes major metropolitan and industrial areas as well as more rural areas at risk for flooding and hurricane surge. The resurveying methods used in this RTK GNSS study allow a large area to be covered relatively quickly with enough detail to determine subsidence rates that are averaged over several decades, and identify at-risk regions that can be monitored more closely with permanent or campaign-style measurements. The most recent measurements were acquired using a Trimble R8 GNSS system on all NGS benchmarks found in the study area. Differential corrections were applied in real time using a VRS network of base stations. Nominal vertical accuracies were 1.5 to 3.0 cm for a 2 to 5 minute reading. Usually three readings were measured and averaged for the final result. A total of 340 benchmarks were used for vertical rate calculations. Original NGS elevations were subtracted from the new elevations and divided by the number of years between the two elevation measurements to determine the average subsidence or uplift rate of the benchmark. Besides inaccuracies in the NGS datasheet and re-measured elevations, another source of error includes uncertainties in the year the NGS datasheet elevations were measured. Overall, vertical rates of change vary from -6 to -15 mm/yr subsidence in Port Arthur, Nederland, and other areas of Jefferson County, as well as in areas northwest of Beaumont, Texas. Other areas with subsidence rates between -10 and -4 mm/yr include parts of the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County, northeastern Chambers County, and the\n\nLate Twentieth-Century Racial Uplift Work.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLogan, Shirley Wilson\n\nThis paper presents a description and brief history of the concept of \"racial uplift\" and describes its implications for a contemporary, Black college professor.

The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), the state's primary water resource planning agency, divided the state into 16 planning regions. Each planning group developed plans to manage both ground water and surface water sources and to meet future demands of various combinations of domestic, agricultural, municipal, and industrial water consumers. This presentation describes the challenges in developing a ground water model for the Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Group (LERWPG), whose region includes 21 counties in the Southern High Plains of Texas. While surface water is supplied to several cities in this region, the vast majority of the regional water use comes from the High Plains aquifer system, often locally referred to as the Ogallala Aquifer. Over 95% of the ground water demand is for irrigated agriculture. The LERWPG had to predict the impact of future TWDB-projected water demands, as provided by the TWDB, on the aquifer for the period 2000 to 2050. If detrimental impacts were noted, alternative management strategies must be proposed. While much effort was spent on evaluating the current status of the ground water reserves, an appropriate numerical model of the aquifer system was necessary to demonstrate future impacts of the predicted withdrawals as well as the effects of the alternative strategies. The modeling effort was completed in the summer of 2000. This presentation concentrates on the political, scientific, and nontechnical issues in this planning process that complicated the modeling effort. Uncertainties in data, most significantly in distribution and intensity of recharge and withdrawals, significantly impacted the calibration and predictive modeling efforts. Four predictive scenarios, including baseline projections, recurrence of the drought of record, precipitation enhancement, and reduced irrigation demand, were simulated to\n\nDRAFT LANDSAT DATA MOSAIC: MONTGOMERY COUNTY, TEXAS; HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS; FORT BEND COUNTY, TEXAS; BRAZORIA COUNTY, TEXAS; GALVESTON COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis is a draft Landsat Data Mosaic, which contains remote sensing information for Montgomery County, Texas Harris County, Texas Fort Bend County, Texas Brazoria County, Texas Galveston County, and Texas Imagery dates on the following dates: October 6, 1999 and September 29, 200...\n\nPresent-day uplift of the western Alps.\n\nPubMed\n\nNocquet, J-M; Sue, C; Walpersdorf, A; Tran, T; LenÃ´tre, N; Vernant, P; Cushing, M; Jouanne, F; Masson, F; Baize, S; ChÃ©ry, J; van der Beek, P A\n\n2016-06-27\n\nCollisional mountain belts grow as a consequence of continental plate convergence and eventually disappear under the combined effects of gravitational collapse and erosion. Using a decade of GPS data, we show that the western Alps are currently characterized by zero horizontal velocity boundary conditions, offering the opportunity to investigate orogen evolution at the time of cessation of plate convergence. We find no significant horizontal motion within the belt, but GPS and levelling measurements independently show a regional pattern of uplift reaching ~2.5âmm/yr in the northwestern Alps. Unless a low viscosity crustal root under the northwestern Alps locally enhances the vertical response to surface unloading, the summed effects of isostatic responses to erosion and glaciation explain at most 60% of the observed uplift rates. Rock-uplift rates corrected from transient glacial isostatic adjustment contributions likely exceed erosion rates in the northwestern Alps. In the absence of active convergence, the observed surface uplift must result from deep-seated processes.\n\nSeismic investigation of Infiltration Through a Playa of the Llano Estacado Region of Texas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFernandez-Canel, A.; Gurrola, H.; Taylor, L.; Abila, H.; Oviedo, R.; Harry, E.; Garza, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMost of the population and economy of the south central United States (the bread baskets of the United States) is heavily dependent on the Ogallala aquifer as the main water resource.

We deployed Texans (Ref Tek RT125A) data loggers with 4.5 Hz single component geophones before and after rain events and after controlled infiltration test to provide a data set to investigate infiltration pathways through the playas. The playa is about eight miles northeast of Lubbock, Texas. We refer to it as compartmentalized because it appears to be two very closely spaced playa; one of which retains water more efficiently than the other. The infiltration tests included the use of 4x8 foot infiltrometers and a 50 foot soaker hose in a compartmentalized playa. Preliminary results from analysis of two repeated profiles suggest that the seismic velocities beneath the infiltrometers and the soaker hose were lower than before flooding. These results suggest that measurements of seismic P-wave velocities may be useful to model the pathway for infiltration through the subsurface of the playa. We have collected (and will continue to collect) additional data sets following rain storms and infiltration test for a few months. We will present the results of these tests at the AGU meeting.\n\nThe evolution of the southern California uplift, 1955 through 1976\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCastle, Robert O.; Elliot, Michael R.; Church, Jack P.; Wood, Spencer H.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe southern California uplift culminated in 1974 as a 150- km-wide crustal swell that extended about 600 km eastward and east-southeastward from Point Arguello to the Colorado River and Salton Sea, respectively; it was characterized by remarkably uniform height changes between 1959 and 1974 of 0.30-0.35 m over at least half of its 60,000-70,000 km2 area. At its zenith, the uplift included virtually the entire Transverse Ranges geologic province and parts of the Coast Ranges, San Joaquin Valley, Sierra Nevada, Basin and Range, Mojave Desert, Peninsular Ranges, and Salton Trough provinces. The alinement of the western part of the uplift closely paralleled the east-trending Transverse Ranges, whereas the southern flank of the eastern lobe roughly coincided with the west-northwest-trending San Andreas fault. The position and configuration of the uplift associate it with a singularly complex section of the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates that has certainly sustained major modification during the past 5 million years and probably during the past 1 million years. Surface deformation can be categorized as tectonic or nontectonic. Nontectonic vertical displacements associated with the activities of man have overwhelmed natural compaction and areally significant soil expansion in the southern California area. Because tectonic displacements are implicitly defined as those that cannot be otherwise explained, those vertical movements that can be reasonably attributed to artificial processes have been subtracted from our reconstructed configurations of the uplift. Hence this reconstruction has necessarily included the assembly and evaluation of an enormous volume of data on oil-field operations, changes in ground-water levels, and measured subsidence (or rebound) associated with changes in the underground fluid regimen. Measured changes in height at various stages in the evolution of the uplift have been based chiefly on first-order levelings carried out\n\nControl of paleoshorelines by trench forebulge uplift, Loyalty Islands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDickinson, William R.\n\n2013-07-01\n\nUnlike most tropical Pacific islands, which lie along island arcs or hotspot chains, the Loyalty Islands between New Caledonia and Vanuatu owe their existence and morphology to the uplift of pre-existing atolls on the flexural forebulge of the New Hebrides Trench. The configuration and topography of each island is a function of distance from the crest of the uplifted forebulge. Both MarÃ© and Lifou are fully emergent paleoatolls upon which ancient barrier reefs form highstanding annular ridges that enclose interior plateaus representing paleolagoon floors, whereas the partially emergent Ouvea paleoatoll rim flanks a drowned remnant lagoon. Emergent paleoshoreline features exposed by island uplift include paleoreef flats constructed as ancient fringing reefs built to past low tide levels and emergent tidal notches incised at past high tide levels. Present paleoshoreline elevations record uplift rates of the islands since last-interglacial and mid-Holocene highstands in global and regional sea levels, respectively, and paleoreef stratigraphy reflects net Quaternary island emergence. The empirical uplift rates vary in harmony with theoretical uplift rates inferred from the different positions of the islands in transit across the trench forebulge at the trench subduction rate. The Loyalty Islands provide a case study of island environments controlled primarily by neotectonics.\n\nUplift of quaternary shorelines in eastern Patagonia: Darwin revisited\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPedoja, Kevin; Regard, Vincent; Husson, Laurent; Martinod, Joseph; Guillaume, Benjamin; Fucks, Enrique; Iglesias, Maximiliano; Weill, Pierre\n\n2011-04-01\n\nDuring his journey on the Beagle, Darwin observed the uniformity in the elevation of coastal Eastern Patagonia along more than 2000 km. More than one century later, the sequences of Quaternary shorelines of eastern Patagonia have been described and their deposits dated but not yet interpreted in terms of geodynamics. Consequently, we i) mapped the repartition of the Quaternary coastal sequences in Argentinean Patagonia, ii) secured accurate altitudes of shoreline angles associated with erosional morphologies (i.e. marine terraces and notches), iii) took into account previous chrono-stratigraphical interpretations in order to calculate mean uplift rates since ~ 440 ka (MIS 11) and proposed age ranges for the higher and older features (up to ~ 180 m), and iv) focused on the Last Interglacial Maximum terrace (MIS 5e) as the best constrained marine terrace (in terms of age and altitude) in order to use it as a tectonic benchmark to quantify uplift rates along the entire passive margin of Eastern South America. Our results show that the eastern Patagonia uplift is constant through time and twice the uplift of the rest of the South American margin. We suggest that the enhanced uplift along the eastern Patagonian coast that interested Darwin during his journey around South America on the Beagle could originate from the subduction of the Chile ridge and the associated dynamic uplift.\n\nLocalized geohazards in West Texas, captured by multi-temporal Sentinel-1A/B interferometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, J. W.; Lu, Z.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWest Texas contains the Permian Basin and is particularly composed of three major geologic sedimentary basins: Delaware Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Midland Basin. Because the vast region was once covered by a shallow sea and had experienced long-lasting evaporation million years ago, the West Texas is underlain by a thick layer of water soluble rocks including the carbonate and evaporite rocks. In addition, the geologic composition provided abundant hydrocarbons in the depth of several kilometers, but the human activities exploiting the massive oil and gas from the subsurface made negative impacts on the stability of underground and ground surface. Most deformation and localized geohazards have been unnoticed by means of field measurements or remote sensing methods, because the West Texas is located in the low populated, remote region. The Sentinel-1A/B has continuously acquired the SAR imagery with a large swath of 250 km over the region, and its multi-temporal measurements can provide clues on what are really taking place on the ground surface, what are the causes to trigger the localized subsidence/uplift, and what should be done to prevent more severe disasters in the future. We have established an automated Sentinel-1A/B InSAR processing system on SMU supercomputer (Maneframe), its continuous monitoring will help us unveil the current status of deformation occurring in West Texas.\n\nSeventeenth-century uplift in eastern Hokkaido, Japan\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAtwater, B.F.; Furakawa, R.; Hemphill-Haley, E.; Ikeda, Y.; Kashima, K.; Kawase, K.; Kelsey, H.M.; Moore, A.L.; Nanayama, F.; Nishimura, Y.; Odagiri, S.; Ota, Y.; Park, S.-C.; Satake, K.; Sawai, Y.; Shimokawa, K.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nShores of eastern Hokkaido rose by perhaps 1 m a few centuries ago. The uplifted area extended at least 50 km along the southern Kuril Trench. It included the estuaries Akkeshi-ko and Hichirippu, on the Pacific coast, and Fu??ren-ko and Onneto??, which open to the Okhotsk Sea. At each estuary, intertidal and subtidal flats rose with respect to tide level; wetland plants colonized the emerging land; and peaty wetland deposits thereby covered mud and sand of the former flats. Previous work at Akkeshi-ko and Onneto?? showed that such emergence occurred at least three times in the past 3000 years. Volcanic-ash layers date the youngest emergence to the seventeenth century AD. New evidence from Akkeshi-ko, Hichirippu and Fu??ren-ko clarifies the age and amount of this youngest emergence. Much of it probably dates from the century's middle decades. Some of the newly emerged land remained above high tides into the middle of the eighteenth century or later. The emergence in the last half of the seventeenth century probably exceeded 0.5 m (inferred from stratigraphy and diatom palaeoecology) without far exceeding 1 m (estimated by comparing seventeenth- and eighteenth-century descriptions of Akkeshi-ko). The stratigraphy and palaeoecology of the emergence are better explained by tectonic uplift than by bay-mouth blockage, tidal-flat accretion or sea-level fall. Eastern Hokkaido needs occasional uplift, moreover, to help reconcile its raised marine terraces with its chronic twentieth-century subsidence. Because it took place above forearc mantle, eastern Hokkaido's seventeenth-century uplift probably lacks analogy with coseismic uplift that occurs above typical plate-boundary ruptures at subduction zones.\n\nDaily hassles and uplifts: a diary study on understanding relationship quality.\n\nPubMed\n\nTotenhagen, Casey J; Serido, Joyce; Curran, Melissa A; Butler, Emily A\n\n2012-10-01\n\nIn this investigation, we use the Conservation of Resources (CoR) theory as a guide to examine how both uplifts and hassles are associated with positive (e.g., satisfaction, commitment) and negative (ambivalence, conflict) relational quality on a daily basis. In previous studies of hassles and uplifts, the focus has been primarily on negative outcomes at the individual level (e.g., affect). Here, we build on this previous research in examining both positive and negative events (i.e., uplifts and hassles) in associations with positive and negative relational qualities. Further, we focus on examining social and nonsocial events that are external to the relationship (i.e., do not involve the romantic partner) and how they are linked with relational qualities. Finally, we examine which patterns are confined to the same day and which carry over to subsequent days (i.e., lagged effects). Contrary to previous literature, we find that both social and nonsocial hassles are largely unrelated to relationship quality after accounting for the effects of social and nonsocial uplifts. In contrast, nonsocial uplifts bolster positive feelings about the relationship on that day. Results also show that hassles and uplifts may work together to explain relational commitment. Finally, we find that nonsocial uplifts experienced on one day are associated with trend-level declines in next day positive feelings about the relationship. Our findings suggest that preserving relationship quality through daily experiences is best achieved by equipping couples to recognize the benefits of uplifts to the relationship, especially uplifts that are nonsocial, in tandem with managing hassles.

In this paper large eddy model (LEM) simulations, which resolve the turbulence within the cold-pools much better than previous studies of haboobs which have used convection-permitting models, are used to investigate the winds that cause dust uplift in cold pools, and the resultant dust uplift and transport. Dust uplift largely occurs in the head of the density current, consistent with the few existing observations. In the modeled density current dust is largely restricted to the lowest coldest and well mixed layer of the cold pool outflow (below around 400 m), except above the head of the cold pool where some dust reaches 2.5 km. This rapid transport to high altitude will contribute to long atmospheric lifetimes of large dust particles from haboobs. Decreasing the model horizontal grid-spacing from 1.0 km to 100 m resolves more turbulence, locally increasing winds, increasing mixing and reducing the propagation speed of the density current. Total accumulated dust uplift is approximately twice as large in 1.0 km runs compared with 100 m runs, suggesting that for studying haboobs in convection-permitting runs the representation of turbulence and mixing is significant. Simulations with surface sensible heat fluxes representative of those from a desert region in daytime show that increasing surface fluxes slow the density current due to increased mixing, but increase dust uplift rates, due to increased downward transport of momentum to the surface.\n\nRadiogenic isotopes of arc lavas constrain uplift of the Andes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScott, Erin; Allen, Mark B.; Macpherson, Colin; McCaffrey, Ken; Davidson, Jon; Saville, Christopher\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOrogenic plateaux are an ultimate expression of continental tectonics, but the timings and mechanisms of their formation are far from understood. The elevation history of the Andes is of particular importance for climatic reconstructions, as they pose the only barrier to atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. Many varied techniques have been utilized over the last two decades to constrain Andean Plateau (AP) surface uplift. Two conflicting schools of thought are prominent: (1) recent, rapid rise since 10-6 Ma (Late Miocene), and (2) slow, continued uplift from 40 Ma. We propose a new, independent, approach to constrain AP surface uplift through time. By comparing isotopic compositions of Andean Quaternary arc lavas to present day crustal thickness and topography, we show that Sr and Nd isotopes are effective discriminants for the modern extent of the AP. As previously described, these isotopic systems are sensitive to crustal contamination, which in turn relates to crustal thickness, and, via isostasy, to regional surface elevation. We apply this relationship to a new compilation of published, age corrected, isotopic compositions of arc lavas, to constrain the surface uplift history of the Andes from the Jurassic to present day. Our results are consistent with significant AP surface uplift beginning in the Mid to Late Paleogene. We show that by 23 Ma, the AP was established at close to its modern elevations between at least 16-28 deg. S, thereby predating models for Late Miocene surface uplift. Between 23-10 Ma, surface uplift propagated south of 28 deg. S by a further 400 km. Our model has implications for understanding magma plumbing systems in regions of thick, wide crust, especially other orogenic plateaux.\n\nEvidence for Holocenic uplift at Somma-Vesuvius\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarturano, Aldo; Aiello, Giuseppe; Barra, Diana; Fedele, Lorenzo; Grifa, Celestino; Morra, Vincenzo; Berg, Ria; Varone, Antonio\n\n2009-07-01\n\nDetailed stratigraphical, archaeological, micropalaeontological, archaeometrical and petrochemical analyses of samples from trenches and boreholes at insula of Casti Amanti, in Pompeii, allowed a faithful reconstruction of the recent environmental evolution of the site. The present data clearly indicate the alternation of both subaerial and shallow marine conditions during Holocene times. Taking into account the relative local sea level variations, a ~ 30 m ground uplift event in the last 6 kyr (with an average vertical uplift rate of ~ 5 mm/yr) was inferred for the first time.\n\nRead Across Texas! 2002 Texas Reading Club Manual.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEdgmon, Missy; Ferate-Soto, Paolo; Foley, Lelana; Hager, Tina; Heard, Adriana; Ingham, Donna; Lopez, Nohemi; McMahon, Dorothy; Meyer, Sally; Parrish, Leila; Rodriguez-Gibbs, Josefina; Moreyra-Torres, Maricela; Travis, Gayle; Welch, Willy\n\nThe goal of the Texas Reading Club is to encourage the children of Texas to become library users and lifelong readers.

Perhaps the most evident manifestations are the flanks of the East African Rift, which cuts across the otherwise minimally deformed continent. Flank uplift was explained by Vening Meinesz (1950, Institut Royal Colonial Belge, Bulletin des Seances, v. 21, p. 539-552), who recognized that isostasy should cause uplift of a normal-faulted footwall and subsidence of its hanging wall. Uplift occurs because slip on a dipping normal fault creates a broader root of less-dense material beneath the footwall, and a narrowed one beneath the hanging wall. In this paper, we investigate the potential influence of this process on the latest stages of Sierra Nevada uplift. Through theoretical calculations and 3D finite element modelling, we find that cumulative slip of about 4km on range-front faults would have produced about 1.3km peak isostatic uplift at the ridge crest. Numerical models suggest that the zone of uplift is narrow, with the width controlled by bending resistance of the seismogenic crust. We conclude that footwall unloading cannot account for the entire elevation of the Sierran crest above sea level, but if range-front faulting initiated in an already elevated plateau like the adjacent Basin and Range Province, then a hybrid model of pre-existing regional uplift and localized footwall unloading can account for the older and newer uplift phases suggested by the geologic record.\n\nThe Sedimentary History of Southern Central Crete: Implications for Neogene Uplift\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrÃ¶ger, K.; Brachert, T. C.; Reuter, M.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe tectonic setting of Crete was largely extensional since Lower Miocene uplift and exhumation of HP/LT rocks. Erosion of uplifted areas resulted in the deposition of terrestrial to marine sediments in the Messara and Iraclion Basins. There are several concurring models that discuss Late Neogene uplift of the basinal margins. Neogene near shore sediments in the south of the Messara Basin record fault movements contemporaneous to sedimentation and sedimentary input from the hinterland. Therefore they provide information on the paleogeographic situation and the resulting amount of subsidence and uplift of mountain areas since the Upper Miocene. The studied sediments consist of terrestrial to shallow marine, floodplain related sediments of the Upper Miocene Ambelouzos Formation that are overlain by platform limestones of the Upper Miocene Varvara Formation. In the Messara Basin these units are overlain by the Pliocene Kourtes Formation. The stratigraphic architecture of these deposits indicates fragmentation of the basinal margin. Proximal boulder conglomerates and reworked blocks of the Ambelouzos formation indicate fault activity during the deposition of the Varvara Formation. Contents of terrigenous clastics, provided by rivers and distributed by longshore currents, are high in the Ambelouzos and the lower Varvara Formations but decrease rapidly upsection within the Varvara Formation. This indicates drowning of the fault bounded blocks and little topography of the hinterland (Asteroussia Mountains) at that time. The Pliocene marls at the southern margin of the Messara Basin contain lithoclasts of the Upper Miocene limestones and thus indicate uplift of the carbonate platform. The modern topographic elevation of formerly drowned fault bounded blocks requires a minimum uplift of 400m. Main uplift occurred at approximately orthogonal NW-SE and SW-NE striking normal to oblique faults. The present elevation of the Asteroussia Mountains indicates net uplift of at least\n\nCenozoic Uplift, Erosion and Dynamic Support of Madagascar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStephenson, Simon; White, Nicky\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe physiography of Madagascar is characterised by high-elevation but low-relief topography; 42% of the landscape is above 500 m in elevation. Eocene (marine) nummulitic (marine) limestones at elevations of Ë400 m above sea level and newly dated, emergent 125 ka coral reefs suggest that Madagascar has experienced differential vertical motions during Cenozoic times. Malagasy rivers are often deeply incised and contain steepened reaches, implying that they have responded to changes in regional uplift rate. However, low temperature thermochronology and 10Be derived erosion rates suggest that both Cenozoic and Recent average denudation rates have been low. Extensive laterite-capped, low-relief surfaces also suggest that there have been long periods of tectonic quiescence. In contrast, the modern landscape is characterised by erosional gullies (i.e. lavaka), with very high local erosion rates. To bridge the gap between this disparate evidence, we inverted 2566 longitudinal river profiles using a damped non-negative, least-squares linear inversion to determine the history of regional uplift. We used a simplified version of the stream power erosional law. River profiles were extracted from the 3 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model. Calibration of the stream power erosional law is based upon Cenozoic limestones and new radiometrically dated marine terraces. The residual misfit between observed and calculated river profiles is small. Results suggest that Malagasy topography grew diachronously by 1-2 km over the last 15-20 Ma. Calculated uplift and denudation are consistent with independent observations. Thus drainage networks contain coherent signals that record regional uplift. The resultant waves of incision are the principal trigger for modern erosional processes. Admittance calculations, the history of basaltic volcanism and nearby oceanic residual age-depth measurements all suggest that as much as 0.8 - 1.1 km of Cenozoic uplift\n\nColorado Plateau magmatism and uplift by warming of heterogeneous lithosphere.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoy, Mousumi; Jordan, Thomas H; Pederson, Joel\n\n2009-06-18\n\nThe forces that drove rock uplift of the low-relief, high-elevation, tectonically stable Colorado Plateau are the subject of long-standing debate. While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension, the plateau experienced approximately 2 km of rock uplift without significant internal deformation. Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities and more negative Bouguer gravity at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.\n\nEpisodic swell growth inferred from variable uplift of the Cape Verde hotspot islands\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRamalho, R.; Helffrich, G.; Cosca, M.; Vance, D.; Hoffmann, D.; Schmidt, D.N.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOn the Beagle voyage, Charles Darwin first noted the creation and subsidence of ocean islands, establishing in geology's infancy that island freeboard changes with time. Hotspot ocean islands have an obvious mechanism for freeboard change through the growth of the bathymetric anomaly, or swell, on which the islands rest. Models for swell development indicate that flexural, thermal or dynamic pressure contributions, as well as spreading of melt residue from the hotspot, can all contribute to island uplift. Here we test various models for swell development using the uplift histories for the islands of the Cape Verde hotspot, derived from isotopic dating of marine terraces and subaerial to submarine lava-flow morphologies. The island uplift histories, in conjunction with inter-island spacing, uplift rate and timing differences, rule out flexural, thermal or dynamic pressure contributions. We also find that uplift cannot be reconciled with models that advocate the spreading of melt residue in swell development unless swell growth is episodic. Instead, we infer from the uplift histories that two processes have acted to raise the islands during the past 6 Myr. During an initial phase, mantle processes acted to build the swell. Subsequently, magmatic intrusions at the island edifice caused 350 m of local uplift at the scale of individual islands. Finally, swell-wide uplift contributed a further 100 m of surface rise.\n\nEpisodic swell growth inferred from variable uplift of the Cape Verde hotspot islands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamalho, R.; Helffrich, G.; Cosca, M.; Vance, D.; Hoffmann, D.; Schmidt, D.

Furthermore, geomorphic and biological evidence, radiometric data and comparison of aerial photographs indicates that the 1956 earthquake (Ms = 7.4) uplifted the footwall of this normal fault by about 30 cm.\n\nOngoing drought-induced uplift in the western United States.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBorsa, Adrian Antal; Agnew, Duncan Carr; Cayan, Daniel R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe western United States has been experiencing severe drought since 2013. The solid earth response to the accompanying loss of surface and near-surface water mass should be a broad region of uplift. We use seasonally adjusted time series from continuously operating global positioning system stations to measure this uplift, which we invert to estimate mass loss. The median uplift is 5 millimeters (mm), with values up to 15 mm in Californiaâs mountains. The associated pattern of mass loss, ranging up to 50 centimeters (cm) of water equivalent, is consistent with observed decreases in precipitation and streamflow. We estimate the total deficit to be ~240 gigatons, equivalent to a 10-cm layer of water over the entire region, or the annual mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nThe southern California uplift and associated earthquakes\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCastle, R.O.; Bernknopf, R.L.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nSouthern California earthquakes ??? M5.5 during the period 1955/01/01-1994/01/17 were concentrated along or adjacent to the south flank of the southern California uplift, as defined both at its culmination and following its partial collapse. Spatial clustering of these earthquakes within three more-or-less distinct groups suggests either gaps along the south flank that were previously filled or are yet to be filled. Nearly all of the indicated earthquakes accompanied or followed partial collapse of the uplift, and seismic activity within this regime seems to have been increasing through at least 1994/01/17.

As many as 18 raised shorelines (strandlines) record this uplift. Historic accounts of uplift during the great earthquakes (M > 8) of 1835 and 1960 suggest some of the more prominent prehistoric strandlines also emerged during great earthquakes on the interface between the Nazca and South America plates. But the close elevational spacing of strandlines, subdued morphology of strandline beaches, scarcity of exposed bedrock wave-cut platforms, and the extremely high rates of aseismic uplift (ca. 70 mm/yr) of the island since the last great earthquake suggest that many strandlines were raised by aseismic rather than coseismic uplift. Strandline heights and 14 new radiocarbon ages on marine shells show that the present-day uplift rate is more than three times the net rate (ca. 20 mm/yr) of the past 1000 years. The recent high rate probably reflects increased aseismic slip on an inferred thrust fault in the overriding South America plate. Isla Mocha overlies an area of high stress concentration between two major segments of the Chilean subduction zone. The inferred high rate of slip on the thrust fault may be a response to stress changes on the plate interface near the boundary between the segments. ?? 1992.\n\nApplication and utility of a low-cost unmanned aerial system to manage and conserve aquatic resources in four Texas rivers\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBirdsong, Timothy W.; Bean, Megan; Grabowski, Timothy B.; Hardy, Thomas B.; Heard, Thomas; Holdstock, Derrick; Kollaus, Kristy; Magnelia, Stephan J.; Tolman, Kristina\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLow-cost unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have recently gained increasing attention in natural resources management due to their versatility and demonstrated utility in collection of high-resolution, temporally-specific geospatial data. This study applied low-cost UAS to support the geospatial data needs of aquatic resources management projects in four Texas rivers. Specifically, a UAS was used to (1) map invasive salt cedar (multiple species in the genus Tamarix) that have degraded instream habitat conditions in the Pease River, (2) map instream meso-habitats and structural habitat features (e.g., boulders, woody debris) in the South Llano River as a baseline prior to watershed-scale habitat improvements, (3) map enduring pools in the Blanco River during drought conditions to guide smallmouth bass removal efforts, and (4) quantify river use by anglers in the Guadalupe River. These four case studies represent an initial step toward assessing the full range of UAS applications in aquatic resources management, including their ability to offer potential cost savings, time efficiencies, and higher quality data over traditional survey methods.\n\nModern Uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains: Preliminary Results of an Autonomous GPS Array\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRaymond, C.
