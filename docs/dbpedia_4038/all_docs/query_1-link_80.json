The total for the\n\nentire year of 1958 was 33.09.\n\nA good feature of both years\n\nwas the fact that the rains scat-\n\ntered through the entire year.\n\nThe lowest amount recorded in\n\neither 1958 or 1959 was 05 which\n\nfell in March of this year. How-\n\never, both February and April\n\nhad large amounts recorded And\n\nin June of this year, there was a\n\nwhopping 9.75 inches recorded.\n\nThese figures tell experienced\n\nranchmen a good deal about the\n\nshape of the county in general;\n\nand the fact that the amount\n\nwhich fell during the first eight\n\nmonths of 1959 is equal to the\n\naverage annual rainfall for the\n\ncounty, tells a good story of green\n\npastures and lush fields.\n\nAbout an inch of raain fell dur-\n\ning an electrical storm Sunday\n\nnight, bringing cooling relief af-\n\nter one of the hottest days of the\n\nhottest days of the summer when\n\nthe temperature soared to 99 de-\n\ngrees, the highest official record-\n\ned this year.

Over two-\n\nthirds of this amount will be from\n\nState funds, and around one third\n\nfrom local tax funds, according to\n\nSuperintendent C. M. Nalls This\n\nbudget does not include lunch\n\nroom funds, athletic funds, activi-\n\nty funds, or any kind of non tax\n\nschool funds.\n\nSalaries for Certified personnel\n\n(teachers, administrators, etc.) re-\n\nquire $176,488, transportation sys-\n\ntem, $27,000.00, bond payments\n\nand interest on bonds, $13,568,\n\nand salaries of non-certified per-\n\nsonnel, (secretaries, custodians,\n\nmaintenance), $12,800.00. The re-\n\nmaining $41,680.00 covers instruc-\n\ntional materials, equipment and\n\nfurnishings, Insurance, mainten-\n\nance and improvement of build-\n\nings and grounds.\n\nThe lunchroom program for the\n\nyear requires around $32,000. Ap-\n\nproximately $5,500 of this amount\n\nis secured from the National\n\nSchool Lunch Program, and the\n\nbalance from meal sales. Main-\n\ntenance from the lunchroom\n\nbuilding facilities is paid from\n\ntax funds.\n\nThe football and basketball pro-\n\ngrams, combined, are self-sup-\n\nporting, except for salaries, which\n\narc paid from tax funds. Football\n\nusually helps support basketball.\n\nAnnual expenditures from the\n\nathletic fund for the two sports\n\nrun around $6,000.\n\nGail Ricketson Takes\n\nCollege Position\n\nDistrict 9A will get off to a\n\nflying start tomorrow night when\n\neach of the five teams in the\n\ndistrict tries out their teams for\n\nsize in the first game of the\n\nseason.\n\nLlano will clash with Menard;\n\nMason at Fredericksburg; Goldth-\n\nwaite at Hamilton; Burnet at\n\nDel Valle and Santa Anna plays\n\nComanche.\n\nWith eleven returning letter-\n\nmen and a heavy team. Mason is\n\nexpected to be a tough team this\n\nyear; Goldthwaite has 16 return-\n\ning lettermen, and is expected\n\nto wind up much better than last\n\nyear’s cellar position. Burnet,\n\nwhich tied for third in 1958 with\n\nSanta Anna, lias 15 lettermen re\n\nturning; and Santa Anna,\n\nhit with only 4 returning letter-\n\nmen, is having to recruit new\n\ninexperienced lower classmen for\n\nplay.\n\nLlano Ians are fortunate this\n\nyear in that there are only two\n\ngames scheduled at a very great\n\ndistance, and even those are clos\n\ner than some games usually sched-\n\nuled. Georgetown and Goldth\n\nwaite are the farthest played\n\naway from home.\n\nCarmen Bonner is the coach of\n\nthe Mason Punchers; Max Blan\n\nsit coaches the Goldthwaite Eagl\n\nes; Cliff Vandeventer coaches the\n\nBurnet Bulldogs; and R C Smith\n\ni is the new coach for the Santa\n\n. Anna Mountaineers. Of course,\n\nRay Gilmore is at the helm of\n\nthe Llano Yellow jackets.\n\nLlano was to have eleven letter-\n\nmen returning this year. However,\n\nHenry Hammons received a rath\n\nj er severe shoulder injury recent\n\nly and will be unable to start the\n\nseason. And with another star\n\nplayer out this year,\n\nHodges, some less experienced\n\nplayers are training to close the\n\nranks in the Jacket team. The\n\n1959 team will be heavier than\n\nlast year’s team, on the average,\n\nand there are a number of very\n\nskilled ball-handlers waiting to\n\nget into action tomorrow night.\n\nDon't forget the Jaycee-sponsor-\n\ned pep rally to be held tonight\n\nat 7:30 at the north end of the\n\nLlano High School Football field\n\nThe first game of the season\n\nwill be played in Llano tomorrow\n\nnight whon the Jackets clash with\n\nthe Menard team. The Llano boys\n\nhave put in many hard hours of\n\npractice, and ;| good tournout j\n\ntonight could give them an added\n\nhard i spark of enthusiam which would!\n\nmean the difference between\n\nplaying a good game or a lop \\\n\nflight game tomorrow night.\n\nThe pep rally is under the dir- j\n\ncction of Jaycees Lester Inman j\n\nand Raymond Winkel; Jackie\n\nLigon anti the other LHS cheer\n\nleaders will assist, and T.

There were\n\n98 first graders enrolled the first\n\nday. This is a record number to\n\nenroll in the first grade, probab-\n\nly, except for 1953 when there\n\nwere about 105.\n\nThe first day enrollment In\n\n1958 was 826 students with 97 in\n\nthe fifth grade being the largest\n\nnumber for any one grade\n\nA tentative first-day count of\n\nthe three schools reveals that\n\nthere were 403 in the five grades\n\nof the Elementary School; 249 in\n\nthe O.
