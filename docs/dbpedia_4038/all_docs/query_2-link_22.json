        "text": "April 8th, 2024 Total Solar Eclipse\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur in south central Texas on April 8, 2024. Totality will begin near the Rio Grande at approximately 1:27pm and only a few minutes later for the rest of south-central Texas. Totality will last almost 4.5 minutes near the center of the path, but only a minute or less near itâ€™s edge.\n\nYou can damage your eyes if you try to view the eclipse without proper eye protection:\n\nBe Prepared for the Weather:\n\nApril in south central Texas is in the middle of our primary severe weather season. Storms producing frequent lightning, large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flooding can all occur here during that time period, and in fact several instances of hail up to 2\" in diameter were reported in the region on April 8, 1986.\n\nIf you're planning to visit the area, or to camp for the weekend, it's important to be prepared for this potential. Consider bringing a battery powered NOAA weather radio to receive warnings if cell networks are slow. Know where your nearest safe shelter is. Familiarize yourself with where the low water crossings in the area are in case of flooding, as you should NEVER drive through flooded roadways.\n\nLocal climatology:\n\nCity Normal High Record High Normal Low Record Low Record Precipitation Austin 79 95 57 34 2.65\" San Antonio 79 98 57 35 1.53\" Del Rio 86 102 61 38 0.86\" Eagle Pass 83 103 56 37 1.40\" Burnet 76 95 51 30 1.60\" Llano 79 99 51 26 1.37\" Fredericksburg 77 99 51 32 1.18\"\n\nFun fact: Under cloud-free conditions, the obscuration of the sun can lead to a temperature drop of about 4 to 8 degrees, with the coolest temperatures lagging about 5 to 10 minutes after totality. Here's how that looked in the Paducah, KY NWS service area during the 2017 total solar eclipse.\n\nEclipse timing (Find down-to-the second information for your location here)\n\nCity Partial Begins Maximum Totality Totality Duration Partial ends Austin 12:17pm 1:37pm 1 minute 57 seconds (less on SE side) 2:58pm San Antonio 12:14pm N/A N/A (brief totality on NW side) 2:56pm Del Rio 12:11pm 1:30pm 3 minutes 27 seconds 2:51pm Eagle Pass 12:10pm 1:30pm 4 minutes 26 seconds 2:51pm Burnet 12:17pm 1:37pm 4 minutes 24 seconds 2:58pm Llano 12:17pm 1:36pm 4 minutes 24 seconds 2:57pm Fredericksburg 12:15pm 1:35pm 4 minutes 26 seconds 2:56pm\n\nMore info and resource links:\n\nFollow our social media pages for frequent weather updates in the week leading up to the eclipse!
