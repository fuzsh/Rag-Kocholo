Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Llano is very rapidly increasing during the spring, rising from 2% to 68% over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on June 22, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 79% of the time, while on January 24, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Spring in Llano\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Spring in LlanoMarAprMay0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%WinterSummerMar 12%Mar 12%May 3168%May 3168%Apr 110%Apr 110%May 134%May 134%oppressiveoppressivemuggymuggyhumidhumiddrydrymiserablemiserablecomfortablecomfortable\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Llano is essentially constant during the spring, remaining within 0.6 miles per hour of 11.1 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 1, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour, while on September 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the spring is 11.7 miles per hour on April 1.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Spring in Llano\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Spring in LlanoMarAprMay0 mph0 mph5 mph5 mph10 mph10 mph15 mph15 mphWinterSummerApr 111.7 mphApr 111.7 mphMar 111.1 mphMar 111.1 mphMay 3110.6 mphMay 3110.6 mphMay 111.2 mphMay 111.2 mph\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Llano throughout the spring is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 72% on May 31.\n\nWind Direction in the Spring in Llano\n\nWind Direction in the Spring in LlanoMarAprMay0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%WinterSummersouthnorthwesteast\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Llano typically lasts for 8.0 months (245 days), from around March 14 to around November 15, rarely starting before February 19 or after April 8, and rarely ending before October 25 or after December 4.\n\nDuring the spring in Llano, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is very rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 100% over the course of the season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Spring in Llano\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Spring in Llanogrowing seasonMarAprMay0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%WinterSummerMar 125%Mar 125%100%May 31100%May 3182%Apr 182%Apr 1100%May 1100%May 1Feb 1910%Feb 1910%very coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhotfreezing\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Llano are very rapidly increasing during the spring, increasing by 1,631Â°F, from 344Â°F to 1,975Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Spring in Llano\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Spring in LlanoMarAprMay400Â°F400Â°F600Â°F600Â°F800Â°F800Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,200Â°F1,200Â°F1,400Â°F1,400Â°F1,600Â°F1,600Â°F1,800Â°F1,800Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,200Â°F2,200Â°FWinterSummerMar 1344Â°FMar 1344Â°FMay 311,975Â°FMay 311,975Â°FApr 1705Â°FApr 1705Â°FMay 11,244Â°FMay 11,244Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Llano is very rapidly increasing during the spring, rising by 2.0 kWh, from 4.9 kWh to 6.9 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Spring in Llano\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Spring in LlanoMarAprMay0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWh8 kWh8 kWh9 kWh9 kWhWinterSummerMar 14.9 kWhMar 14.9 kWhMay 316.9 kWhMay 316.9 kWhApr 16.1 kWhApr 16.1 kWhMay 16.5 kWhMay 16.5 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Llano are 30.759 deg latitude, -98.675 deg longitude, and 1,030 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Llano contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 285 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,060 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (906 feet). Within 50 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,611 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Llano is covered by grassland (46%) and shrubs (43%), within 10 miles by grassland (48%) and shrubs (45%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (44%) and grassland (41%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Llano, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Llano.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Llano according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Llano is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Llano and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLlano Municipal Airport (KAQO, 96%, 1.9 mi, northeast, 69 ft elevation change)\n\nHorseshoe Bay Resort Airport (KDZB, 2.8%, 24 mi, southeast, 62 ft elevation change)\n\nGillespie County Airport (KT82, 1.3%, 38 mi, south, 663 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Llano and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
