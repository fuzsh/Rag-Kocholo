        "text": "It is no surprise to those who lived through it, but the summer of 2023 brought the heat to the South Plains region, and to all of Texas. After a pleasantly cool and wet start to June, the weather turned drier and much hotter, especially by the second half of the month, as the above plot of temperatures at Lubbock shows. Lubbock observed its first 100 degree temperature of the year on June 19th, relatively late in the season for what ended up being an exceptionally hot summer. However, by the end of June Lubbock had reached 100 degrees or higher on 9 days, just shy of the long term average for the entire summer. This included 109ËšF on the 27th, 108ËšF on the 21st and 24th, 107ËšF on the 20th, 106ËšF on the 28th and 105ËšF on the 19th.\n\nThe final day of June into early July provided modest relief, with temperatures closer to average. Unfortunately, the \"cool\" temperatures didn't last, with triple digits returning to northwest Texas the second week of July, and becoming a mainstay until late August, with only a few short interludes of minor cooling. The hottest temperature reached in Lubbock was 110ËšF, which set a daily record high on July 12th, while August saw three days that reached 107ËšF (August 11th, 12th and 17th), all records for the day. The heat continued into early September, with Lubbock reaching 100ËšF on 6 of the first 8 days, including an all-time September record high of 107ËšF on the 8th.\n\nThe hot summer included three 6-day stretches where Lubbock reached 100ËšF or higher, each of which tied for the 13th longest such streak. This could have been even more impressive except for a 95ËšF high on August 7th, which separated two of the 6-day stretches. This \"chilly\" day preserved the all-time consecutive 100-degree streak of 12 days, set in Lubbock back in 1980. Childress observed 15 straight days at or above 100ËšF from late July into early August, which ranks 16th overall and well behind the absurd record of 50 straight days in 2011.\n\nComing back to West Texas, August was particularly toasty, even in comparison to the summer as a whole. The daily average temperature at Lubbock was 85.5 degrees, an impressive 5.6 degrees above average, and second only to 2011 at 86.0 degrees. The average high measured at Lubbock was 99.2 degrees, a whopping 7.0 degrees above average, which tied for the second hottest August on record with 2011 (just shy of the all-time August record of 99.5 degrees, set in 1943).\n\nFor Childress, the monthly average temperature was 87.0 degrees. This made it the sixth warmest August at Childress (2011 remains #1 with an average of 90.9 degrees). In terms of the high temperature, the monthly average was 101.3 degrees, which puts it in 4th place overall (1943 was the hottest with an amazing 106 degrees!).\n\nNot surprisingly, the hottest weather in 2023 occurred during a prolonged stretch of dry weather, between the wet end of May and start to June and the brief return of widespread rain and thunderstorms the second week of September. Looking at this dry and hot stretch, specifically from June 19th through September 8th, Lubbock recorded it hottest readings on record with respect to average highs and average temperatures, beating out 2011 in both cases (it also tied 2011 for the warmest average lows over this same period).\n\nFor Childress, from June 19th through September 8th, they finished with the 7th hottest average high, the 5th highest average temperature and 10th warmest average low on record. The robust green up after the widespread significant rain in late May and early June, combined with a bit more precipitation through the heart of summer (than Lubbock), contributed to the slightly \"cooler\" temperatures in Childress versus Lubbock when looking at historic rankings. That said, actual temperatures measured at Childress (average highs, lows and mean temperature) during this stretch were warm/hotter than Lubbock.\n\nThe above image shows the approximate amount of rainfall that fell across northwestern Texas from mid-June through early September. Rain totals below 2 to 3 inches were common over most of the South Plains during this 2.5+ month stretch. Spotty heavier totals were found over parts of the southern Texas Panhandle into the Rolling Plains, but it did come with severe weather too, including the tornadic storm that impacted Matador on June 21st."
