        "text": "Top Gun: Maverick is a movie that asks how relevant Maverick (played by Tom Cruise) is in 2022—and by extension, how relevant the kind of movie stars that Cruise represents are. Based on the staggering opening weekend of the second Top Gun film, Maverick definitely still has his wings.\n\nThe opening weekend for Top Gun 2 broke box office records, not only for Cruise but for opening weekends in general.\n\nGrand statements about a new era in Hollywood moviemaking might be too hasty (it is still a sequel, after all, even though it was released 36 years after the original). But the film has shown that it is not only superhero movies that can be big box office successes—movies can also make $150 million on their opening weekend if they star pilots whose flying skills are basically superpowers, too.\n\nHere's how much Top Gun: Maverick made in its first weekend in theaters—and the records it broke while there.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick opening weekend box office\n\nOver the normal three-day opening weekend (Friday-Sunday), Top Gun 2 made $126 million at the domestic box office. Add the extra Monday for Memorial Day, and the weekend total in the U.S. was $156 million. (All numbers courtesy Box Office Mojo).\n\nThe U.S. was not the only market where Maverick had a strong weekend. The film took $20 million in the U.K., $10 million in Australia and $9.7 million in Japan, for a total worldwide box office of $282 million. This is an especially impressive number seeing as the film is not out in Russia or China. In its opening weekend, Top Gun 2 was number one in the box offices of all 30 countries that Box Office Mojo has public data for.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick has the biggest Memorial Day opening weekend of all time\n\nThe film's U.S. total puts it $17 million above its closest Memorial Day rival, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The third installment of Johnny Depp's flagship franchise had held the record for 15 years before Cruise took it this weekend.\n\nCruise now has two films in the top 20 for Memorial Day opening weekends. Sitting at number 16 is Mission: Impossible 2, which took $70.1 million over its four-day weekend in late May 2000 (and $58 million over that Friday-Sunday).\n\nTop Gun 2 has the biggest opening weekend of Tom Cruise's career\n\n...and by quite some margin. Technically, the previous biggest opening weekend for a Cruise film is the $73 million made by Austin Powers in Goldmember, in which Cruise has a cameo in the film-within-a-film.\n\nOf the movies in which Cruise was the lead, War of the Worlds had the biggest three-day opening weekend with $65 million in 2005.\n\nApart from those films, all his biggest openings have been Mission: Impossible—Fallout took $61 million, II $58 million, Rogue Nation $56 million, III $48 million and the original M:I $45 million.\n\nAs this shows, Maverick is also the first time a Cruise movie has opened higher than $100 million.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick has the widest release of all time for a PG-13 movie\n\nTop Gun 2's box office taking was helped by the fact that it opened in more theaters than any PG-13 movie before it.\n\nOver the Memorial Day weekend, the movie opened in 4,735 theaters—more even than Avengers: Endgame (4,662).\n\nThe film also has the second-ever widest opening in any MPAA rating behind The Lion King reboot, which opened in 4,802 theaters in 2019.\n\nDid Top Gun: Maverick have the biggest opening weekend of 2022?\n\nNo, that was one record it did not break. Its $126 million three-day total was behind The Batman with $176 million and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with $231 million.\n\nHow does it compare with the original Top Gun?\n\nThe success of the original Top Gun was much more-slow burn, as were most film releases in the 1980s.\n\nThe film took $8.1 million in its first weekend from May 16, 1986, putting it at number one in the box office charts that week. Its highest-grossing weekend came the following week, when the film made $9.4 million over Memorial Day.\n\nThough it never opened in more than 1,600 theaters, the film stayed in the charts for a long time. Across 1986, the film spent 27 weeks in the top 10, leaving the charts for good over the Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is in theaters now."
