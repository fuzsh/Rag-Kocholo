        "text": "Synopsis\n\nTom Cruise has recently signed a deal with Warner Bros., linking him to a major studio outside Paramount. The deal may allow the iconic actor to finally make a sequel to his 2014 sci-fi movie 'Edge of Tomorrow'. Under the Warner Bros. deal, Cruise will have to make a film with Oscar-winning director Alejandro G. Inarritu.\n\n'Top Gun: Maverick' hit theaters on May 27, 2022, after being delayed by the Covid pandemic, but it stormed the box office and broke records as it collected $1.4 billion worldwide. The Tom Cruise- starrer was hailed as the movie that saved Hollywood. There is no surprise that immediately after this, producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced the plan for making its sequel and confirmed later that the iconic star will return as Maverick for 'Top Gun 3'.\n\nWhen will 'Top Gun 3' begin?\n\nIf media reports are to be believed, Tom Cruise is a busy man, and it is almost impossible to say when 'Top Gun 3' will finally hit the screens. Talking to 'Comic Book' producer Jerry Bruckheimer said, \"It's hard to tell. You don't know, you really don't know.\" He further said, \"You don't know how they come together. You just don't know. Because with Top Gun you have an actor who is iconic and brilliant. And how many movies he does before he does Top Gun, I can't tell you.\"\n\nTom Cruise has no time?\n\nAccording to 'Screen Rant', one of the reasons for the delay is 'Mission: Impossible 8', the retitled franchise sequel Cruise is currently hard at work filming. Before he takes up any other assignment, Tom Cruise has to finish work on the eighth, and maybe last, 'Mission: Impossible' film and it could take many years. Even after finishing playing Ethan Hunt, Cruise may still have many other projects lined up before getting back to 'Top Gun'.\n\nTom Cruise signs deal with Warner Bros.\n\nIn a development that may further puh the making of 'Top Gun 3', Tom Cruise has recently signed a deal with Warner Bros., linking him to a major studio outside Paramount. The deal may allow the iconic actor to finally make a sequel to his 2014 sci-fi movie 'Edge of Tomorrow'. Under the Warner Bros. deal, Cruise will have to make a film with Oscar-winning director Alejandro G. Inarritu. Besides, Cruise has wished for a long time to star in a sci-fi movie and fly into space.\n\nWill 'Top Gun 3' premiere in 2030?\n\nConsidering these circumstances, 'Top Gun 3' might not realistically premiere before 2030. Keeping in mind the fat that his fans waited 36 years for 'Top Gun: Maverick' to happen, an 8-year hiatus may not feel that long.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy is 'Top Gun 3' being delayed?\n\nOne of the reasons for the delay is 'Mission: Impossible 8', the retitled franchise sequel Cruise is currently hard at work filming. Before he takes up any other assignment, Tom Cruise has to finish work on the eighth, and maybe last, 'Mission: Impossible' film and it could take many years.
