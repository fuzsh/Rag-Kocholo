        "text": "Click Here To Promote Anything On The Above Place\n\nLos Angeles, April 21 - One of the biggest Hollywood superstars, Tom Cruise returned to the big screen last year with the action thriller Top Gun: Maverick. It is the sequel to Cruise's 1986's blockbuster \"Top Gun\".\n\nDirected by Joseph Kosinski, \"Top Gun 2\" was a delayed release due to the covid-19 pandemic. It was originally scheduled for a 2019 release but was delayed to June 26, 2020, in order to shoot several complex action sequences. 2020 was the year when the covid-19 pandemic gripped the world and the delay in the release was inevitable.\n\nThe makers had hoped for a smooth release in 2021, but the relentlessness of the pandemic forced them to come with their product in 2022 only. During the period of covid-19, which was really taking a huge toll on the movie business, \"Top Gun 2\" makers had reportedly considered it to send for a direct OTT release.\n\nIf not for Tom Cruise himself, the film would have gone to direct OTT release. Cruise showed tremendous confidence in the film and also promised the theater owners that the movie would only be released on the big screen no matter how many times it delays.\n\nIn April 2022, Maverick hit the big screen and proved Cruise right with an extraordinary performance at the domestic as well as international box office. It is now the highest-grossing film of Cruise's career and as things stand today, it was the second most profitable movie worldwide in 2022.\n\n\"Top Gun 2\" grossed over $1.49 billion worldwide, including $719 million at the North American box office (5th biggest ever) and $775 million internationally. Worldwide, it was the second highest-grossing film of 2022, behind only \"Avatar: The Way of Water\".\n\nAccording to Deadline, the total revenue of the movie is $1.15 billion, including $700 million worldwide theatrical share. Against the total cost, which is approx. $754 million, \"Top Gun 2\" generated a whopping $391 million profit for the studio. Tom Cruise reportedly earned a massive $200 million.\n\nThe success of \"Top Gun 2\" came at a time when Hollywood needed a big blockbuster. Blockbuster filmmaker Steven Spielberg righly hailed the film's success and credited for saving Hollywood. Cruise is now gearing up for the release of \"Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One\" which is slated for July 14, 2023, release.\n\nStay tuned..."
