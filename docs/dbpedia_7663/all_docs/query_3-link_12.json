        "text": "The film, starring Tom Cruise in a reprise of his role from 36 years earlier as a pilot in the US armed forces, took in almost €6.1m in revenue.\n\nSequels of hit movies dominated the most popular films screened in the Republic last year with the second highest-grossing film, Minions: The Rise of Gru.\n\nThe fifth movie in the highly successful animated Despicable Me/Minions series recorded box office receipts of over €4.8m.\n\nIt was followed by another sequel, The Batman, starring Robert Pattison in the title role and Irish actor Colin Farrell as Penguin which took in over €4.4m.\n\nThe Batman surpassed Top Gun: Maverick in terms of box office receipts for the opening weekend of its release with revenue of €1.37m compared to around €585,000 for the Tom Cruise film.\n\nThe fourth biggest grossing movie in Ireland last year, Avatar 2, with revenue of €3.74m might well have overtaken Top Gun: Maverick for the No 1 spot but its release just before Christmas meant its box office receipts were based on just three weeks in the cinema.\n\nThe list of top five movies — which was completed with another sequel, Sing 2 in 5th place with receipts of €3.45m — accounted for almost 20% of total income in 2022.\n\nOverall box office revenue from the country’s 110 cinemas last year was just over €92m — which is 23% below their pre-pandemic peak of €119.7m in 2019.\n\nThe director of film classification, Ciarán Kissane, said a total of 438 films were certified for release in Irish cinemas in 2022 — up 52% on the previous year when many screens had remained closed for periods due to lockdown restrictions during the pandemic.\n\n“This is indicative of the Irish cinema industry returning to pre-covid levels of theatrical release,” said Dr Kissane.\n\nHe claimed further growth was projected for 2023.\n\nDVDs\n\nHowever, Dr Kissane — whose role was previously known as the film censor — said the number of DVD titles certified in 2022 had decreased by 26% annually to 1,511.\n\nHe claimed such figures were in line with the increasing contraction of the DVD market in the context of streaming and video-on-demand platforms.\n\nThe director confirmed that none of his decisions on the classification of films last year had been appealed to the Classification of Films Appeals Board.\n\nA total of 10 complaints from the public about movies were made to the IFCO last year — up from three in 2021 — including complaints relating to the supernatural horror, Smile; the historical thriller, Emancipation; and the Viking epic, The Northman."
