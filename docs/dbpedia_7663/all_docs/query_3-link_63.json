        "text": "To say that Top Gun: Maverick, the sequel to the original Top Gun movie, has been long-awaited would be an understatement.\n\nNot only was the original film released in 1986—meaning that this sequel comes a whopping 36 years after the first film—but it was also originally supposed to hit the big screen in July of 2019!\n\nDue to the many complex flight sequences, production initially postponed its theatrical release date by a year—announcing that the new date would be June 2020.\n\nHowever, thanks to the pandemic, scheduling delays with star Tom Cruise and other reasons, Top Gun: Maverick was delayed three more times until the final, official date was announced: May 27, 2022!\n\nWith such a long buildup to this movie, it’s one that you won’t want to just watch in theaters—it’s one that was made to be experienced. Thanks to D-BOX’s high-fidelity haptic feedback, you’ll feel as if you’re strapped in the cockpit and flying alongside the legendary Pete Mitchell as opposed to just watching him fly!\n\nD-BOX was fortunate enough to see an early screening of the movie at CinemaCon 2022, and not only is it action-packed, but it’s funny, entertaining and just the right amount of nostalgic.\n\nTo get you ready for this next chapter in the Top Gun franchise, we’ve compiled a list of facts about the film, recapped the original and will give you a hint towards what you can expect from this latest blockbuster release!\n\n1986’s Top Gun\n\nOver 36 years ago, the original Top Gun film hit theaters and stole the hearts of movie lovers worldwide. Inspired by a California magazine article entitled Top Guns that published three years earlier, the film stars Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards and Tom Skerritt!\n\nCruise took on the top role of Lieutenant Pete Maverick Mitchell, a young naval aviator who was stationed aboard an aircraft carrier. After he and his Radar Intercept Officer LTJG Nick Bradshaw are given a chance to train at the US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School, their lives are turned upside down with high-speed missions that have life and death hanging on the line.\n\nThe original film was an enormous success, and it grossed over $356 million worldwide against an original budget of $15 million! The soundtrack to the film is also one of the most popular movie soundtracks ever, being one of the rare few to have reached the 9x Platinum Certification.\n\nTop Gun was so popular that it has also been selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry, meaning that it was found to be either culturally, historically or aesthetically significant—adding even more hype to the sequel.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nDespite his talents in the cockpit, Pete Mitchell managed to avoid advancement in rank even after 30 years of service. When his lack of advancement means he gets put in charge of training a group of Top Gun graduates, he’s forced to confront the parts of his past that he’s been trying to ignore—and it’s no coincidence that among the class is Bradley Bradshaw, the son of his now deceased friend Nick.\n\nWith Cruise reprising his role, Miles Teller playing Bradley Bradshaw and with Jennifer Connelly playing Maverick’s love interest, Top Gun: Maverick promises to be just as thrilling as the first film—especially if seen in D-BOX!\n\nThough the film is yet to hit theaters, there’s more than just the long buildup that makes this release so exciting!\n\nLady Gaga wrote the theme song\n\nAfter winning an Oscar for her work on the soundtrack of the film A Star is Born, Lady Gaga is back to composing for movies and is the one to have written the theme song for Top Gun: Maverick!\n\nIn a post on her Instagram account, Lady Gaga confirmed that her new single Hold My Hand will serve as the theme of the movie, and that it has been in the works for a very long time—calling it a “love letter to the world during and after a very hard time.”\n\nTom Cruise potentially flies his own plane\n\nNot only does Cruise play the role of a pilot, but he’s actually held a pilot’s license since early in 1994!\n\nWhile he’s rumoured to own 3-5 personal planes, his favourite is said to be his P-51 Mustang, which is a single seat fighter plane with origins going back to World War II.\n\nAccording to IMDB—when he flies a P-51 in the film, it’s rumoured to be his actual personal plane!\n\nLimited to no CGI in Top Gun: Maverick\n\nSince you evidently cannot have a Top Gun movie without Cruise, production takes the time to listen to the star’s requests—and he reportedly insisted that he would not participate in the sequel if there were plans to have the entire fleet of planes be computer-generated!\n\nThis means that the vast majority of the planes seen on-screen are real aircraft flown for aerial sequences, and that a lot of the cast had to undergo extensive g-force training to be able to withstand the very physical demands of flight!\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is a movie sure to match the hype\n\nWith an Oscar winner behind the theme song, no CGI for the main flight sequences, Cruise potentially flying his own plane and with this all coming 36 years after the original movie, there’s no doubt that Top Gun: Maverick is going to be one of the biggest and most successful films of the year!\n\nAs of today, the movie is estimated to gross anywhere from $95 to $135 million in its opening weekend alone.\n\nTo really take this long-awaited movie to the next level, be sure to see it in D-BOX—you’ll feel as if you’re the pilot undergoing dangerous missions and training the latest graduates."
