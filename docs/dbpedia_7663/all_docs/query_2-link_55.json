        "text": "After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators, Pete ​“Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley Bradshaw (Miles Teller), call sign: ​“Rooster,” the son of Maverick’s late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka ​“Goose”.\n\nFacing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it. Top Gun: Maverick also stars Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Bashir Salahuddin, Monica Barbaro, Jay Ellis, Danny Ramirez, Greg Tarzan Davis with Ed Harris.\n\nThe UK Premiere of TOP GUN: MAVERICK will be the 72nd Royal Film Performance™ delivered by the charity in its almost 100-year history.\n\nThe Royal Film Performance™ is the flagship fundraiser for long-time Paramount non-profit partner, the Film and TV Charity, an organisation that supports the tens of thousands of people working behind the scenes in the UK’s world-leading film and television industry.\n\nAlex Pumfrey, CEO of the Film and TV Charity, said:\n\n“The Royal Film Performance™ gives us the opportunity to lend focus to the brilliant, creative individuals who make up the film, TV, and cinema community – and the UK premiere of Top Gun: Maverick makes that opportunity just about as big as it can be. For that, our heartfelt thanks must go to Paramount Pictures, Skydance Media, and TC Productions.\n\n“The last couple of years have been incredibly tough for everyone, not least people working behind the scenes who saw their livelihoods threatened by the pandemic. After such a challenging time, it really does feel special to be using the platform that is the Royal Film Performance™ to celebrate the return of event cinema, and also to shine a light on the support we’re able to offer to those who make it all possible. Thanks to the generosity of our guests, and the thousands of people and organisations who have donated to the charity, we have been able to support more than 10,000 people in the last two years – and our work is only just beginning.\n\n“We continue to develop new sources of support, always tailored to the needs of our colleagues and friends across the industry, providing ways of helping with mental health and wellbeing, financial aid and guidance, or with practical solutions to issues they may encounter. Occasions like The Royal Film Performance mean we can continue to do so, and for this we are endlessly grateful to everyone who makes the event possible.”\n\nParamount Pictures will release TOP GUN: MAVERICK in the UK and Ireland on 25 May 2022.\n\nThe date of this event has now passed."
