        "text": "When folks first saw Top Gun after its May 1986 debut, no one could have predicted it would become this much of a cultural phenomenon.\n\nStarring Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, the movie follows Naval Aviator Lt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell as he gets stationed in the Indian Ocean along the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. As Maverick gets the opportunity to train at the U.S. Navy's Fight Weapons School (also known as \"Top Gun\"), a series of events occurs that causes him to bond with those he didn't know initially.\n\nThe movie quickly garnered success at the box office, and it even won a Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Song, which was Berlin's hit \"Take My Breath Away.\" It also later spawned a 2022 sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, which saw Tom and Val reprise their roles alongside a plethora of new actors to the franchise ( including Miles Teller and Glen Powell) .\n\nGiven Top Gun: Maverick's equal amount of recognition (including a 2023 Academy Award for Best Sound), it comes as no surprise that fans would want to know if a third Top Gun movie is in the works. Well, we have a major update, and it's one folks will want to pay close attention to.\n\nWill there be a Top Gun 3?\n\nAs of January 2024, Top Gun 3 is officially in the works.\n\nThe announcement of another Top Gun film came from Deadline on January 11, which revealed Top Gun 3 is officially in development. According to the outlet, Top Gun: Maverick co-writer Ehren Kruger is writing the upcoming movie and it will be produced by Paramount Pictures (the studio that produced the previous two films).\n\nThat's not all the publication revealed about Top Gun 3. Presently, it looks like Tom is not only on board, but he'd be reuniting with Miles Teller (who played Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw) and Glen Powell (who portrayed Lt. Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin) for the project, with Jerry Bruckheimer coming back as a producer for the film .\n\nAs for when will folks get to see Top Gun 3? Well, that remains to be seen. As Jerry told Screen Rant in March 2024, Tom is so busy with other projects, it's hard to tell when he'll have time to film the next Top Gun movie.\n\n\"You never know when it’s going to get made because Tom is so busy,\" he told the outlet at the time. \"He’s doing Mission: Impossible right now, he’s got a picture after it. Hopefully, we’ll get a screenplay that he loves, and we’ll be back in the air again.\"\n\nNo matter the case, we're going to keep our fingers crossed for Top Gun 3 to happen!"
