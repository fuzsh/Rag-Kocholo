        "text": "More conservative types may have worried that Tom Cruise suiting up as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell was a “ride into the danger zone” of obsolesce. But this weekend’s receipts for Top Gun: Maverick have proven them wrong.\n\nThe Jerry Bruckheimer-produced, Joseph Kosinski-directed sequel to the 1986 original didn’t just do well, it leveled the competition as if it were a bunker nestled amidst mountainous terrain in an unnamed but nefarious rogue nation.\n\nVariety reported that it grossed $156 million domestically over the Memorial Day weekend, beating 2007’s Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End by three million for the record. The trade outlet also noted that the film unspooled in 4,732 North American theaters, making it the widest release of all time.\n\nThe movie’s success didn’t stop at our nation’s borders (proudly defended by our naval aviators with callsigns like Maverick, Rooster, Hangman, Phoenix, Fanboy, and, uh, Bob.) It earned a reported $124 million, which by my math makes $280 million. This is even more impressive when you consider, as The Hollywood Reporter pointed out, that the movie is not showing in Russia or China.\n\nThe film, which co-stars Miles Teller, Jon Hamm, Jennifer Connelly, Monica Barbaro, and a special appearance by Val Kilmer also has a stratospheric 97 percent from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, it joins the ranks of films to win an A+ from Cinemascore, which polls exiting audience members for their opinion. (Peruse the list, though, and you’ll see not everything on there is a masterpiece.)\n\nTom Cruise has spoken many times about his insistence on delaying the movie during the pandemic in favor of a theatrical release. Let's face it, some movies don't suffer too much when you watch them at home, but when Mav is suffering G forces to keep our nation safe, you need the big screen and the rumble of professional-grade speakers. The gambit to wait has certainly paid off, with people already sinking their teeth into this movie (and thinking about it) with tremendous gusto.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nthe need for speed\n\nLady Gaga Unveils Her Top Gun: Maverick Power Ballad, “Hold My Hand”\n\nThe song, which Gaga calls “a love letter to the world during and after a very hard time,” catapults her into next year’s Oscar race.\n\nNeed For Reprieve\n\nTop Gun: Maverick Made a Man Eat His Own Shoe, as Well as His Words\n\nAfter betting against a Top Gun sequel more than a decade ago, Matt Patches is making good on his promise—and tempting the movie fates once more.\n\nReview\n\nIn Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise Is His Own Wingman\n\nThis long-delayed sequel mostly exists as a tribute to its enduring star.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump Has Nothing Else\n\nWhen the ex-president is desperate, he gets stuck on the 2020 election—and racist taunts.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump Was Totally Not Being Serious When He Suggested He’s Going to Appoint Himself President for Life: Republicans\n\nThis is a guy who loves democracy, after all.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M. Chu are reportedly attached to helm the film for Universal."
