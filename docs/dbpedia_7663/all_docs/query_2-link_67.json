The film also brought in a stellar $1.96 million at the New Zealand box office.\n\nYears on from its original release date, the film had its first of many moments in the sun after launching at CinemaCon a few weeks ago, as well as premiering at an exclusive screening at the Cannes Film Festival, where Cruise explained the during a wide-ranging talk about his work that there was no possibility of this film being released on a streaming service. “I make movies for the big screen”, said Cruise.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick isn’t Cruise’s only film that’s received love in the last week with the seventh entry in the long-running Mission: Impossible franchise, with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One trailer officially releasing to the public on Monday last week, and set to hit cinemas in July next year."
