        "text": "More than 35 years after the original Top Gun, the Tom Cruise blockbuster has gotten a sequel in Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nIn the original, Top Gun (1986), a young Cruise stars as the hot-shot pilot Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, as he and his co-pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards) take part in the Navy’s top school for elite fighter pilots. Maverick likes to push it to the limit, but that ends up getting him in trouble and his confidence gets shaken following a tragic accident. But the happy ending prevails and he saves the day and gets the girl.\n\nTop Gun remains a fan-favorite to this day, thanks to numerous factors including a star-making turn from Tom Cruise, memorable supporting characters like Anthony Edwards' Goose and Val Kilmer's Iceman, fantastic '80s tunes like \"Danger Zone\" and \"Take My Breath Away\" and incredible aerial sequences. Talk about a sequel has been swirling for years and now its here.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nHow to watch Top Gun: Maverick\n\nAfter being a box-office behemoth (it is the no. 1 movie at the 2022 global box office with $1.48 billion) movie fans can watch Top Gun: Maverick at home. It's available in most regions on Paramount Plus.\n\nHere's how to watch Top Gun: Maverick right now.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick awards and nominations\n\nAfter dominating the boxoffice, Top Gun: Maverick hopes to dominate awards season too. Here are the nominations and awards that Top Gun: Maverick has earned to date:\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nBest Picture (nominee)\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay — Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, Justin Marks (nominees)\n\nBest Editing (nominee)\n\nBest Original Song — \"Hold My Hand\" (nominee)\n\nBest Sound (nominee)\n\nBest Visual Effects (nominee)\n\nGolden Globes\n\nBest Picture: Drama (nominee)\n\nBest Song — \"Hold My Hand\" (nominee)\n\nCritics Choice Awards\n\nBest Picture (nominee)\n\nBest Actor — Tom Cruise (nominee)\n\nBest Cinematography (nominee)\n\nBest Editing (nominee)\n\nBest Visual Effects (nominee)\n\nBest Song — \"Hold My Hand\" (nominee)\n\nLondon Critics Circle Awards\n\nFilm of the Year (nominee)\n\nNational Board of Review\n\nBest Film\n\nOutstanding Achievement in Cinematography — Claudio Miranda\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Cinematographer — Claudio Miranda\n\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI Movie of the Year\n\nPeople's Choice Awards\n\nThe Movie of 2022 (nominee)\n\nAcademy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films\n\nBest Action/Adventure Film (winner)\n\nBest Actor — Tom Cruise (winner)\n\nBest Director — Joseph Kosinski (nominee)\n\nBest Editing (nominee)\n\nBest Special Effects (nominee)\n\nTop Gun: Maverick plot\n\nTop Gun: Maverick takes place more than 30 years after the events of Top Gun. Maverick is now working as a test pilot and actively attempting to dodge the advancement in rank that would force him to stop flying.\n\nHowever, his career ends up taking him back to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics School — otherwise known as TOP GUN — where he has to confront his past as he is charged with training a new squadron of fighter pilots.\n\nHow long is Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nTop Gun: Maverick has a runtime of two hours and 10 minutes.\n\nWhat is Top Gun: Maverick rated?\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is rated \"PG-13\" for US audiences (parents required for anyone under 13) and \"12A\" for UK moviegoers (suitable for children 12 and over).\n\nTop Gun: Maverick cast\n\nTom Cruise will be just shy of 60 when Top Gun: Maverick is released, but there is no way Hollywood was going to make Top Gun 2 and not have him back in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Maverick remains one of Cruise’s most iconic roles, so you just can’t have a Top Gun movie without the star reprising the character.\n\nCruise isn’t the only cast member returning from the original film. Maverick’s frenemy is back, as Val Kilmer will once again play Iceman. Anyone who has seen the documentary Val on Prime Video knows that Kilmer currently uses a voice box to speak after battling throat cancer. Despite his health concerns, Cruise was adamant that Kilmer would return for the sequel.\n\nThere will also be plenty of new faces in Top Gun: Maverick. Key to the plot is Miles Teller, who will be playing Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of Maverick’s old co-pilot Goose. Other new members of the cast include Jennifer Connelly as Penny Benjamin, Jon Hamm as Cyclone, Glen Powell as Hangman, Monica Barbaro as Phoenix, Jay Ellis as Payback, Lewis Pullman as Bob, Charles Parnell Warlock, Bashir Salahuddin as Hondo and Ed Harris as Read Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain.\n\nFind out more about the Top Gun: Maverick cast right here.\n\nTom Cruise's best stunts — from Mission: Impossible to Edge of Tomorrow\n\nFifteen of the best Tom Cruise movies — from Risky Business to Top Gun 2\n\nTop Gun: Maverick reviews — what critics said\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is one of the best reviewed movies of the year. It was quickly labeled a \"perfect summer blockbuster\" and something that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Official reviews were just as glowing, including What to Watch's Top Gun: Maverick review, which called the movie a \"stratospheric sequel\" and one that both pays tribute to the original but also surpasses it.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick has a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 78 on Metacritic.\n\nTom Cruise spoke with What to Watch sister publication Total Film about the movie in an issue earlier in 2022:\n\nTop Gun: Maverick Royal Premiere\n\nStraight from their Cannes screening, the stars headed to London for a Royal Film Premiere.

Take a look at some of the pictures from the global premiere and quotes from the stars.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick soundtrack — Kenny Loggins \"Danger Zone\"\n\nAlmost as important as which of the cast members would return, fans want to know if Top Gun's iconic theme song, \"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins will be part of Top Gun 2.\n\nThe good news is the answer is yes. Kenny Loggins confirmed on Rob Lowe's podcast, Literally with Rob Lowe, that \"Danger Zone\" would play in Top Gun: Maverick.
