        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nTom Cruise’s 2022 blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick has flown past Avengers: Infinity War to become the sixth highest grossing film United States domestic box office history.\n\nThis record breaking achievement comes just two weeks after the film passed paramount’s Titanic to become the seventh highest grossing film.\n\nAs of today, the film has made US$683 million domestically and US$720 million overseas, bringing its total to a whopping US$1.4 billion, just 13 weeks after its release.\n\nThis achievement is astonishing, given that action film was not released in China or Russia.\n\nChina is the most populated country in the world, making noticeable contributions to ticket sales in the international box office. If the film was released in its cinemas, it have amassed far greater revenue.\n\nContinuing its hypersonic run, the action film is heading to digital this week for purchases only and then 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD November 1 from Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nBut, it will remain in theatres as Paramount attempts to squeeze all it can from viewers and lovers of the film.\n\nThis is Cruise’s most financially successful movie of all time and Paramount’s biggest live-action title in 37 offshore markets. These include the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow, all eyes are set to see if Maverick will dethrone another Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film.\n\nCurrently, Marvel’s Black Panther, starring the late Chadwick Boseman, occupies the fifth spot for highest domestic grossed film."
