        "text": "In an early scene in Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise’s character, Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, the daring fighter pilot from the original 1986 Top Gun is reintroduced to audiences as he is called to task by a superior for disobeying orders. The end is near, Rear Admiral Chester “Hammer” Cain (Ed Harris) tells the renegade fighter pilot; men like him will soon be “extinct”.\n\n“Maybe so, sir,” Maverick replies. “But not today.”\n\nWhile the line was referencing human fighter pilots being edged out by new technology, it neatly parallels Cruise’s own life. One of Hollywood’s last leading men, Cruise has managed to sustain a lengthy career throughout a changing industry.\n\nNow at age 59, the actor has smashed several records. With a domestic gross of $520.8 million and an international gross of $486.1 million, his Top Gun: Maverick has not only become the highest grossing movie of the year, reaching $1 billion on Sunday, June 26, but Cruise’s highest grossing movie ever, dethroning 2018’s Mission: Impossible - Fallout. An even bigger milestone: Cruise has now taken in over $1 billion in all-time earnings from dozens of movies over his nearly four decade career that essentially began in 1983 with his breakout role in Risky Business.\n\nCruise is often referred to as one of Hollywood’s last true movie stars. That’s due not only to his enduring star power but also largely thanks to the deal he has with Paramount Pictures for Maverick. He was reportedly paid $12.5 million up front plus over 10% of so-called “first-dollar gross,” the Hollywood term for a cut of revenue collected by the studio, which includes roughly half of tickets sold in theaters, plus revenue from rights to show the film on everything from streaming services and airlines, to television networks around the world.\n\nIn a world with rapidly diminishing theatrical windows and speedy moves to streaming, Cruise’s deal is an anomaly amid the more typical large upfront pay for streaming-only films, or smaller back ends that are paid out after the studio makes a theatrical release’s budget back.\n\nThanks to the Maverick’s record haul, the actor has already pocketed more than $50 million. If the pace continues for Maverick, it will also set an annual earnings record for Cruise, who first appeared on the Forbes list of Highest-Paid Entertainers in 1986, the year Top Gun was released. That year, he appeared at No. 30 on the ranking with estimated earnings of $5 million after deducting fees paid to his agent, manager and legal representation. The original was released to mixed reviews, but grossed more than $357 million worldwide, and helped to propel Cruise to leading man status.\n\nHe was a fixture in the entertainment rankings for the next three decades, peaking at No. 9 in 2012, the year he earned an estimated $75 million thanks to the releases of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Jack Reacher, another action hit he starred in. The two films had global ticket sales of $911 million, with Ghost Protocol pulling it $694 million. Until this year’s sequel, his highest-grossing film was 2018’s Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which had global ticket sales of $787 million.\n\nForbes estimates that Cruise will likely gross more than $100 million altogether from Maverick, based on our estimates of additional revenue that will come in from other sources like airlines, streaming and TV networks. That would set a new record for an actor’s take from a single movie, besting Will Smith’s payout from Men In Black 3.\n\nCruise, who has stirred controversy as a notable member of the Church of Scientology and has been divorced three times, has likely blown through a lot of his career earnings, but will have another chance to make up for some of it next year, when the seventh and penultimate film in the series, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part 1, is slated to release."
