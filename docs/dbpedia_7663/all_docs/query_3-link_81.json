        "text": "Having already dominated the summer box office on its way to being one of the highest grossing movies of 2022, “Top Gun: Maverick” landed a few more accolades by winning three Golden Trailer Awards during a ceremony held in Los Angeles on 6 October.\n\nThe Paramount Pictures sequel to the hit 1986 movie won three of the 18 categories handed out during the event, including Best Summer 2022 Blockbuster Trailer and the coveted Best In Show prize. “Top Gun: Maverick” was also awarded with the trophy for Best Action Trailer.\n\nIn accepting the first of the film’s three awards, Chad Miller, President of AV Squad, the firm who created the “Top Gun: Maverick” trailer, thanked editor Joel Landis. He went on to point out the trailer was produced two years earlier and then was delayed, along with the film itself, for two yeas due to the COVID pandemic.\n\nThis year marks the 22nd annual Golden Trailer Awards which honor the best trailers and marketing material for movies, television and streaming series. The companies and individuals responsible for creating the marketing campaigns turned up en masse for the ceremony which was held at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The proceedings were hosted by comedian Henry Cho who kept the evening moving along rather swiftly.\n\nThe Golden Trailer Awards also hand out prizes for social media campaigns, posters, radio and television spots and other marketing campaigns for film, television and streaming titles. In a sign of how the industry is shifting towards streaming services, this year the event expanded with two new categories included in the live ceremony; Best Drama for Television/Streaming and Best Comedy for Television/Streaming. Campaigns considered for the awards had to be created between 4 April 2021 and 31 May 2022.\n\nIn discussing this year’s event, Golden Trailer Awards co-founder Evelyn Brady-Watters said, “We are thrilled to offer a huge congratulations to all of this years’ honorees and nominees. Their contributions are imperative to this industry and we appreciate their contributions, as well as everyone who came out to support their creativity.”\n\nA complete list of winners can be found on the Golden Trailer Awards website.
