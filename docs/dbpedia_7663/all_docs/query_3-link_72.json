        "text": "Tom Cruise has been famous for pretty much our entire lives, so yeah: the dude is rich. And not just normal ~celebrity millionaire~ rich. Tom is worth over half a billion dollars thanks to his lengthy career as a permanent A-lister. This man has been in some of the highest grossing films quite simply ever, which is his main source of income since obviously he's not out here doing spon-con. Let's break it down movie by movie and vaguely spiral about his wealth, shall we?\n\nTom Cruise's Movie Earnings\n\nCredit to Celebrity Net Worth for this truly wild information, and please note we're going to be breaking out the Mission Impossible movies into their own category because Tom's earnings on them are bananas.\n\nRisky Business (1983)\n\n$75,000 (Note: this was Tom's breakout role, so his salary was on the lower side for an A-lister.)\n\nLegend (1985)\n\n$500,000\n\nTop Gun (1986)\n\n$2 million\n\nCocktail (1988)\n\n$3 million\n\nDays of Thunder (1990)\n\n$9 million\n\nFar and Away (1992)\n\n$13 million\n\nA Few Good Men (1992)\n\n$12 million\n\nThe Firm (1993)\n\n$12 million\n\nInterview with the Vampire (1994)\n\n$15 million\n\nWhat Did Tom Cruise Make for Mission Impossible?\n\nYou simply are not ready. Tom made a reported $70 million for the first Mission Impossible movie and $75 million for Mission Impossible 3, mostly thanks to producer credits. But his most profitable film sandwiched in between them: Mission Impossible 2. Tom apparently earned $100 million for this movie thanks to backend deals and earned the same for 2005's War of the Worlds.\n\nHere are some of Tom's musings to Forbes on all those sequels, by the way:\n\nCool but speaking of sequels...\n\nWhat Did Tom Cruise Make for Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nGlad you asked, my fellow snoop! Variety initially reported that Tom made $13 million upfront for the film, but noted that he expected to earn millions more on the backend. Which, lol, he certainly did. So far, Tom's reportedly netted a full $100 million from a combination of his upfront salary and ticket salesâ€”and that's expected to increase once rentals and streaming revenue come into play.\n\nFYI, he's negotiated this same deal for the next Mission Impossible movies: $12 to $14 million upfront, with way more expected on the backend.\n\nHis Total Career Earnings Between 1983 and 2019?\n\nThat'd be a reported $745 million. Also, according to CinemaBlend he makes $7,091 per word of dialogue. No wonder Forbes has listed him as one of the richest actors in the world ðŸ˜µðŸ’«.\n\nHow Much Does He Pay in Child Support?\n\nIf you want to get *supremely* nosy, yes: there are details about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's financial settlement to go over! Back in 2012, TMZ reported that Tom was required to pay Katie $400,000 a year in child support until their daughter Suri turned 18 (which ends up being a total of $4.8 million...literally a teeny drop in Tom's net worth bucket). Katie didn't get spousal support, but Tom agreed to pay for Suri's \"medical, dental, insurance, education, college and extracurricular costs.\"\n\nTom Cruise's Real Estate Is Worth a Fortune\n\nMuch like Scott Disick of the critically acclaimed Flip It Like a Disick, Tom Cruise buys and sells a lot of homes. He's flipped a ton of properties over the years, but his most recent one was a Telluride home that Forbes reports he sold for $39.5 million. He famously filmed an Oprah interview in this house, and there's an extremely blurry video of the home tour for us to watch together, yay:\n\nWhat Is Tom Cruise's Total Net Worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, it is $600 million, and considering his average salary is $50 million a year, expect it to keep going up!\n\nYou Might Also Like"
