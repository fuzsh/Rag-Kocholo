        "text": "A handful of new faces have joined the Top Gun: Maverick cast, including Miles Teller as Maverick's protégé Rooster – the son of his old friend Goose who famously died during the events of the first film.\n\nCruise previously promised the movie will be \"everything you hope it's going to be\".\n\n\"The movie has exactly the right mix of nostalgia for the first one, but then the continuation of the story and the characters,\" he told Today.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick's release date was delayed multiple times as a result of the pandemic, but director Joseph Kosinski’s new movie has finally landed in cinemas around the globe (read our review here).\n\nSo, without further ado, read on for everything you need to know about the highly-anticipated Top Gun sequel.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick was released in UK cinemas on Wednesday 25th May 2022.\n\nThis comes just under a month after its premiere at CinemaCon on 28th April 2022.\n\nThe film will also play out of competition at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on 18th May.\n\nThe sequel was originally scheduled to be released on 12th July 2019 but was then pushed back almost a year to 26th June 2020 - and then again to 17th July 2020.\n\nHowever, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the entertainment industry, the film was then pushed back to 23rd December 2020 before it was moved again to 2021. Paramount set a July release date, but yes – it was delayed again to November before landing on its final release date.\n\nThis means that the sequel will come 36 years after its predecessor. The initial delay was due to Paramount Pictures wanting additional time to present flight sequences with new planes and technology, according to Variety.\n\nTom Cruise shared the initial news on Instagram saying: \"I know many of you have waited 34 years. Unfortunately, it will be a little longer.\"\n\nIf you're wondering what took so long, Cruise said that he doesn't \"make movies just to make movies\".\n\nFilming took place from May 2018 to June 2019.\n\nRead More: How to watch Top Gun 1986 online – is it on Netflix?\n\nHow to watch Top Gun 2: Maverick\n\nTo begin with, the film will be released exclusively in cinemas – so fans hoping to watch it in their own homes will have to wait a little while before they can do so.\n\nIn fact, Cruise recently confirmed he never considered letting Top Gun: Maverick debut on streaming, despite numerous release date delays brought about by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the movie will presumably become available to stream on Paramount Plus roughly three months after the theatrical release, although an exact date for this has not been confirmed at this stage.\n\nThat date will most likely be after Paramount Plus arrives in the UK this summer, with the streamer set to launch as part of the Sky Cinema package at no extra cost to subscribers.\n\nInterestingly, The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2021 that Netflix and Apple TV+ had both made attempts to purchase the distribution rights to the film during the pandemic, but Paramount refused to sell them.\n\nWho stars in Top Gun 2: Maverick?\n\nThe following have all been confirmed for Top Gun: Maverick cast.\n\nTom Cruise as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n\nMiles Teller as Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw\n\nJennifer Connelly as Penny Benjamin\n\nJon Hamm as Vice Admiral Cyclone\n\nGlen Powell as \"Hangman\"\n\nLewis Pullman as Bob \"Bob\" Floyd\n\nEd Harris as a Rear Admiral\n\nVal Kilmer as Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky\n\nMonica Barbaro as Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace\n\nCharles Parnell as Rear Admiral Warlock\n\nDanny Ramirez as \"Fanboy\"\n\nManny Jacinto as Fritz\n\nBashir Salahuddin as Coleman\n\nJay Ellis as Lieutenant Reuben \"Payback\" Fitch\n\nLyliana Wray as Amelia Benjamin\n\nJean Louisa Kelly as Sarah Kazansky\n\nGreg Tarzan Davis as Coyote\n\nBob Stephenson as United States Air Force General Edward Clayton\n\nChelsea Harris as Flag Aide Angela Burke\n\nAfter 35 years of rumours and speculation, Tom Cruise will finally be returning to his iconic '80s role as Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell.\n\nWhile appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Tom Cruise said: “For years the studios and audiences wanted me to do it and then Jerry Bruckheimer wanted to do it, so we talked and came up with some good ideas.\n\n\"It was just that moment when I thought, ‘if I’m going to do this, now’s the time.’”\n\nJoining Cruise's Maverick will be Val Kilmer as Tom 'Iceman' Kazansky, with their developing relationship being one element of the new film.\n\nProducer Jerry Bruckheimer previously revealed that Tom Cruise was adamant that Val Kilmer would return to the fold, explaining to People: “He said, ‘We have to have Val, we have to have him back. We have to have him in the film'.\n\n\"He was the driving force. We all wanted him, but Tom was really adamant that if he’s going to make another Top Gun, Val had to be in it.\"\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski told Entertainment Weekly: “The rivalry and relationship between Iceman and Maverick is one of those things that makes that first film so iconic.”\n\n“It’s a relationship that is important to the Top Gun franchise and as a fan I would want to see how it’s evolved.”\n\nMiles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) will also take on the role of Goose’s son and Maverick’s new protégé, Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw.\n\nDiscussing his character on The Graham Norton Show, Teller said: \"The storyline taking place 35 years after the last film is really wonderful because my character is a man now and there is a lot of history with Maverick. The film is phenomenal.”\n\nEd Harris (playing a rear admiral), Jon Hamm (as a vice admiral), Lewis Pullman (pilot trainee Bob), Jennifer Connelly as Maverick's new love interest Penny and Glen Powell (pilot trainee 'Hangman') have also joined the Top Gun: Maverick cast.\n\nConnelly is the movie's lead playing a single mother who runs a local bar near the base. A new pilot with also be played by Manny Jacinto, fromThe Good Place.\n\nAt one point it seems Kilmer had confirmed the retired Gene Hackman would appear, but this isn't the case. Michael Ironside also won't be back as Lt Commander Rick 'Jester' Heatherly - apparently, his relationship with the director Jerry Bruckheimer isn't very good.\n\nSpeaking about his character, Jon Hamm recently told Men's Journal, \"It’s not so much of a father figure, the way Viper was to Tom. He’s air boss of the fighter wing. He has a lot of authority and responsibility. When that rubs up against Maverick, there’s friction, as you would guess. I provide the friction.\"\n\nDo Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan return for Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nDespite playing central roles in the 1986 film Top Gun, actresses Kelly McGillis and Meg Ryan do not reprise their roles.\n\nDespite being Maverick's love interest in the first film, McGillis is not back as Charlie Blackwood and is not mentioned in the film at all.\n\nMeg Ryan also does not return as Carole Bradshaw, the wife of Maverick's best friend \"Goose\" and the mother of his son Bradley.\n\nHowever, Ryan appears via archive footage and Carole is also discussed in the film.\n\nSpeaking to Insider, Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski has revealed that returns for McGillis and Ryan were never considered.\n\n\"Those weren't stories that we were throwing around,\" revealed Kosinski, adding: \"I didn't want every storyline to always be looking backwards.\"\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight back in 2019, McGillis herself had confirmed she had not been asked to return for Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThe actress said: \"I'm old and I'm fat and I look age-appropriate for what my age is. And that is not what that whole scene is about.\"\n\nTop Gun 2: Maverick plot\n\nExclusive footage of the film's first 13 minutes was shown during CinemaCon, giving viewers a tease of what to expect. Mild spoilers for Top Gun: Maverick's opening scene ahead.\n\nTom Cruise's Maverick is told by Ed Harris' Admiral that the Top Gun programme is being shut down. Still not one to abide by the rules, Maverick ignores the Admiral's warnings and hops into his jet. His full-speed flight to Mach 10, however, ends in tragedy as it looks like a mid-air explosion has taken out the pilot.\n\nLuckily, Maverick is revealed to be alive when he walks into a country diner and asks, \"Where am I?\"\n\n\"Earth,\" a little boy responds.\n\nThe official synopsis offers a chance to fill in the rest: \"After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him.\n\n\"When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialised mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt Bradley Bradshaw, call sign 'Rooster', the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt Nick Bradshaw, aka 'Goose'.\n\n\"Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.\"\n\nTo adapt with the times, the movie will focus on the waning days of dogfighting and the new era of drone warfare. It is being speculated that, just like in the original, our pilots will be facing off against the Russians.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick also sees Tom Cruise truly in the pilot seat. He had expressed his desire to fly the fighter jets for real and demanded the stunts be “practical, no CGI.”\n\n\"Everything you see in this film is for real,\" he later told the SDCC audience. \"We're working with the Navy, all of the flying you see in this picture is real, I really wanted to give you all an experience of what it is to be inside that aircraft.\n\n\"It's a love letter to aviation.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Cruise has taken to the skies to perform his own stunts – he learned to fly a helicopter for 2018's Mission Impossible: Fallout.\n\nThe full synopsis reads: \"After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him.\n\n\"When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialised mission the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt Bradley Bradshaw, call sign 'Rooster', the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer Lt Nick Bradshaw, aka 'Goose'.\n\n\"Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.\"\n\nTop Gun 2: Maverick trailers\n\nThe first trailer was shown at Comic-Con International in 2019. Fans pointed out the similarities to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with shots that echoed the sci-fi movie.\n\nAnother trailer was then released that Christmas, which LEGO even made a version of.\n\nA further trailer was released for the Super Bowl 2022.\n\nFinally, the latest and longest trailer for the film so far was released on Tuesday 29th March 2022.\n\nYou can watch the clip below.\n\nAs well as the trailer, the first 13 minutes of the film were unveiled during CinemaCon. The footage shows Cruise's Maverick once again ignoring his superior's (Ed Harris) orders when he is told the Top Gun program is getting shut down, which leads to an almost fatal accident.\n\nCruise appeared at 2019's San Diego Comic-Con to release the new footage, taking the stage in a packed Hall H too.\n\nMeanwhile, several posters have also been released for the film –check this one out below:\n\nTop Gun 2: Maverick trailer controversy\n\nOne scene in the movie's first trailer showed Cruise's Maverick wearing the same leather jacket he sported in the original movie – but with a crucial difference.\n\nWhile in the first Top Gun film, the piece of clothing displayed flag patches for Japan and Taiwan, the sequel has the same two patches showing unidentifiable shapes in a similar colour scheme.\n\nThe reason? Well, fans are speculating that it all comes down to China which has emerged as a huge movie market since Top Gun was released 34 years ago.\n\nAdd to that the fact that Tencent Pictures – the film arm of Chinese company Tencent – has co-financed the sequel, and many have come to the conclusion that the switch was made so as not to alienate Chinese powers that be and cinema-goers.\n\nWhat was the original Top Gun movie about?\n\nThe '80s classic follows US Naval Aviator Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, a talented pilot with little regard for the rules and a close friendship with co-pilot Goose (played by Anthony Edwards).\n\nHe is recruited to an elite fighter school, where he clashes with fellow student Iceman (Val Kilmer) in the race to win the coveted Top Gun trophy. Oh, and he starts to fall for the beautiful instructor, Charlie (Kelly McGillis), as well.\n\nDoes Tom Cruise do his own stunts?\n\nYes, in an interview with Empire, Cruise said he told producer Jerry Bruckheimer that he’d agreed to return as Maverick on one condition: he could do his own stunts.\n\n\"I said to Jerry, ‘I’ll do it if…’ meaning, I’m not going to do the CGI stuff,\" he revealed.\n\nIn addition, Jennifer Connelly revealed that Cruise was up for the stunts, calling them \"extraordinary\".\n\nBruckheimer, speaking to Yahoo, said: \"[Cruise] put the actors through this gruelling process over three months so they could take the G-forces when we put them in the F/A-18s. It was really a tough slog for these young actors, because they also had to go through water survival training, where they are blindfolded and put in a water tank that's turned upside down and they have to figure out how to get out.\n\n\"And Tom went through all the same stuff! They told me he went through that training just like a 22-year-old would — that's how good he is.\"\n\nHe added that the main difference in the original Top Gun the team put the cast in the F-14s.\n\n\"We couldn't use one frame of it, except some stuff on Tom, because they all threw up,\" he said. \"It's hysterical to see their eyes roll back in their heads. So everything was done on a gimbal. But in this movie, Tom wanted to make sure the actors could actually be in the F-18s.\"\n\nWhile appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Cruise's co-stars spoke of their experiences doing their own stunts - including Jennifer Connelly, who said she was afraid to tell Cruise that she was scared of flying.\n\n\"When I signed on for the movie there was no flying for my character. I then found myself taxiing on a runway in a tiny plane with Tom and he said, ‘Have you been a plane like this before? Have you ever done any aerobatic flying before?'\n\nI started to get very nervous when he said, ‘It will be very graceful and very elegant,’ and that’s how I found out I would be up in the P51 with Tom flying it!”\n\nMiles Teller added: “I did know, but underestimated the training that was needed to withstand the g-force. It is no joke to get in those jets.\n\n\"It was intense. You don’t need green screen when you’ve got Tom – it was a real pleasure working with him.”\n\nTop Gun: Maverick soundtrack – All the songs in the sequel\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is released in cinemas on 27th May 2022.
