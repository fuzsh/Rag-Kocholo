        "text": "In the end, nothing could top \"Barbie.\"\n\nGreta Gerwig's smash hit ended the year as the highest-grossing film of 2023, having raked in more than $1.4 billion since hitting theaters in July.\n\nIt's the first time in years that a non-sequel has topped the year-end box office. Indeed, of the 10 highest-grossing films of the year, half are part of ongoing series. \"The Little Mermaid,\" meanwhile, is a remake.\n\nBut the top two films, \"Barbie\" and No. 2 \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" are both standalone properties (for now). Christopher Nolan's historical drama \"Oppenheimer\" rounded out the top three with its $951 million haul.\n\n\"I think audiences are really showing what they want are films that are a little different,\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nAfter topping the 2022 box office charts with \"Top Gun: Maverick\" — \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" split its $2.3 billion box office haul between 2022 and 2023 — Tom Cruise made another appearance in the top 10 with his latest \"Mission Impossible\" sequel.\n\nMarvel Studios, which in recent years has topped the year-end box office on multiple occasions with \"Spider-Man\" and \"Avengers\" films, claimed two spots in the top 10.\n\nThese are the highest-grossing films released in 2023, according to Comscore data pulled on December 18."
