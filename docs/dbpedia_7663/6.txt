The feature film Top Gun: Maverick continues to rack up more box office records. In nearly a month of showing in theaters, the film starring Tom Cruise surpassed $ 800 million in revenue from ticket sales.

With this amount collected, the new Top Gun surpassed the box office revenue of the actor's most financially successful film, Mission Impossible: Fallout, released in 2018, the same year in which filming began.

In the US alone, Top Gun: Maverick grossed $422,2 million at the box office. Paramount, the film's distributor, said it will continue to be shown for the next few days, given its success with audiences.

That haul makes Top Gun: Maverick the biggest US movie opening, when we exclude movies involving superheroes.

One of the records broken by the new “Top Gun” was the lowest drop rates after the opening week. The film "Shrek 2" was the owner of the record for a drop of 33%. Tom Cruise's new movie scored 32% in US theaters after its opening week.

The amount collected at the box office also shows that it was an excellent decision by Paramount to release the film in the post-pandemic. Top Gun: Maverick it was scheduled to premiere in 2020, but the risk of contamination by the coronavirus delayed its arrival in theaters several times.

Paramount had to shell out $11374 for every hour of flight on each F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter. The payment was made to the US Navy, as compensation for the use of the aircraft. For pilot training footage the US Navy does not charge this compensation.

The total budget for the production of the feature film was US$ 152 million.
