        "text": "Main page: Wikipedia:Statistics § Page views\n\nFor the usage of \"popular\" in articles, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Puffery.\n\n“ \"Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Fact. Making it even better? Its public list of stats, shedding light on what the collective world is thinking about.\"[1] ”\n\nThe popular pages from December 1, 2007, to the present demonstrates human interests during that period. The views data for Wikipedia's first years (2001–2007) is fragmentary and complete data on mobile views is available only since July 1, 2015. This presently (until the age of advanced electronic archeology) precludes the possibility of all-time ranking with the multiyear perspective being the closest we can get to.\n\nThe lists below include desktop views since December 1, 2007, and mobile views since July 1, 2015. For consolation, with this data we are very close to the all time ranking and will ever be closer. Wikipedia logged significantly less views before the count started in December 2007. Wikipedia reached the top 10 of Alexa.com in March 2007,[2] only half a year earlier, and before May 2003 Wikipedia had not even been on this list of 3000 websites.[3] Moreover, as views accumulate over time, the pre-2007 views become ever less significant. Even if known, they would not alter either the ranking, or views counted in hundreds of millions.\n\nBeing one of the best indicators of \"what the collective world is thinking about,\" the list of most viewed Wikipedia pages receives wide attention in unassociated institutions and external popular media sources. One scholar in 2007 was puzzled why Wikipedia does not offer a \"most viewed\" or \"most popular\" feature on its site that can be easily found, as is the case on some contemporary highly visited sites, such as YouTube, Digg or Del.icio.us.[4]\n\nUniversity of Milan created an engine of the complete yearly ranking of all Wikipedia articles for 2014–2021.[5] In 2013 the BBC published an article discussing most searched Wikipedia articles in 2012 in different languages.[6] Other versions of top-lists for shorter periods are regularly published and discussed by external popular media.[7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\nMost-viewed pages were detected from earlier lists for shorter periods (named in Wikipedia:Statistics#Page views). The number of views for the detected pages were found by such engines as Wikitally (existed until 2017), Multiyear ranking of Wikipedia pages views[13] and Massview.[14] The latter counts views by category since July 1, 2015.\n\nThe undisputed leader is Wikipedia's Main page, with over 46.8 billion views as of January 2022—more than the rest of the Top-100 list combined, including non-ranked pages. For comparison, \"Baby Shark\", which leads YouTube for the most views on that site[15] has 14.7 billion views. According to its information page, the Main page was created as Wikipedia marked its first year, on January 26, 2002. Wikipedia:Most popular pages October 2001, however, states that the Main page had existed and led by wide margin already in October 2001. It is not known which pages had led the ranking during Wikipedia's first months, although by the end of the first month (January 31, 2001) the most viewed page was Usenet cabal.[16]\n\nAmong the conventional pages with mostly human intentional views (ranked pages below), the United States probably took the lead in the pre-view-count period (2001–2007), as it can be seen in the October 2001 list and featured strongly in all available monthly reports for 2003 and 2004. Having held the first place until January 20, 2021, the US was surpassed by its former president, Donald Trump. The US regained the leadership in August the same year.\n\nBy Wikipedia's 20th anniversary (in 2021), it had become clear that the most interesting phenomena for humans are... humans, especially contemporaries and especially when they die.\n\nIn total, humans represent over a quarter of all Wikipedia articles. As of November 2023 1,915,609 people out of 6,748,287 articles, 28%.[17] As of January 2023 , 66 pages of the top-100 list belong to humans. It was not the case from the beginning. In the October 2001 list, for example, we see one human—the co-founder of Wikipedia Larry Sanger. Within two decades, however, a huge human invasion occurred. Humans came seriously and for long.\n\nCorrespondingly, the most interesting object in the Universe for humans is the planet of the humans, provided we disregard Star Wars, Darth Vader and the situation comedy called The Big Bang Theory. Half a millennium after Copernicus and a century after Edwin Hubble, the collective interest remains geocentric.\n\n(December 1, 2007 – January 1, 2023).\n\nCOVID-19 appeared on the all-time list in June 2020; the page did not exist in the beginning of the year. In this respect, COVID-19 is the biggest phenomenon Wikipedia has ever known.\n\nDonald Trump became the first person to reach 200 million views and overall second only after his country. On January 20, 2021, the day he left office, he surpassed the United States for the all-time lead among the ranked pages in what we know as the first change of the leading page. The 2021 storming of the United States Capitol gave him the decisive push. By notable contrast, his predecessor Barack Obama could not reach the US in two terms. Joe Biden debuted on the list on November 12, 2020.\n\nIn 2021, Manchester United became the first sports team to enter the list.\n\nIn the first trimester of 2022, Vladimir Putin debuted on the list. Among the non-English speaking politicians, he became the first active state leader, the first living political leader, and overall second only to Adolf Hitler. Synchronously, Russia progressed 14 places and Will Smith 12 places.\n\nRank Page Views in millions [a] Main Page 46,800 [a] Special:Search 15,000 [a] Special:Random 7,900 [b] - 2,900 [a] Undefined 1,800 [c] United States Senate[18] 350 [a] Special:Watchlist 344 [a] Special:Randompage 314 [d] YouTube 296 [d] Wiki 277 [d] Facebook 277 1 United States 254 2 Donald Trump 243 [c] Wikipedia 228 [b] 404.php 225 [c] xHamster 212 [a] Portal:Current events 208 3 Elizabeth II 198 [d] Google 193 [a] Special:Book 185 [a] Special:CreateAccount 172 4 India 165 5 Barack Obama 161 [a] Search 153 [c] Bible 153 6 Cristiano Ronaldo 151 7 World War II 145 8 United Kingdom 144 9 Michael Jackson 142 [a] Wikipedia:Your first article 137 10 Elon Musk 135 [a] Special:RecentChanges 135 11 Sex 132 [e] Cleopatra 132 12 Lady Gaga 129 12 Adolf Hitler 129 14 Eminem 127 15 Lionel Messi 125 16 Game of Thrones 122 17 World War I 121 18 The Beatles 116 19 Justin Bieber 114 20 Canada 113 20 Freddie Mercury 113 22 Kim Kardashian 111 23 Johnny Depp 109 [a] Creative Commons Attribution 109 24 Steve Jobs 108 24 Dwayne Johnson 108 26 Michael Jordan 107 26 Australia 107 28 List of presidents of the United States 104 29 The Big Bang Theory 103 30 Taylor Swift 102 [a] Search engine[22] 102 31 Stephen Hawking 101 31 List of highest-grossing films 101 33 China 100 [a] Portal:Contents 100 [a] XXXX 96 [c] Malware 96 34 Russia 96 34 New York City 96 34 Japan 96 34 Kanye West 96 38 List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films 95 38 Abraham Lincoln 95 40 LeBron James 94 40 Charles III[23] 94 40 Darth Vader 94 40 Star Wars 94 40 Miley Cyrus 94 40 Germany 94 40 September 11 attacks[24] 94 47 Leonardo DiCaprio 93 48 Kobe Bryant 92 48 Selena Gomez 92 50 Joe Biden 91 50 Tom Cruise 91 50 Rihanna 91 50 Albert Einstein 91 50 Academy Awards 91 55 Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh 90 55 Harry Potter 90 55 Elvis Presley 90 55 The Walking Dead (TV series) 90 59 Scarlett Johansson 89 59 Lil Wayne 89 59 Tupac Shakur 89 59 Angelina Jolie 89 63 Queen Victoria 88 63 Jeffrey Dahmer 88 65 John F.

Palin dropped from the list the following year, mainly due to the mighty advance of the British royal family.\n\nPutin himself approached relegation by the fall of 2021. Desperate for views, he launched the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and left the experts puzzled why did he invade. The results proved to be better than expected. Having logged about 16 million views in the first month of the war, he secured his place on this list for years and reached the general top-100 list above.\n\nTrump's successor, Joe Biden, debuted on the list in October 2020. By the end of the month, he shared the 22nd place with Stalin. In three more days he reached Margaret Thatcher on the 21st rank. The next day, the day of election, Biden added 1.8 million views and equaled another British lady, Elizabeth I, in the top-20. The next day, November 5, he joined his predecessor, FDR, on the 19th place. The day Biden was confirmed President, November 7, he logged 3 million views and the next day 4 million and rose to the 9th place.\n\nNevertheless, those days Biden was not the most popular. He was outviewed by Kamala Harris. Having logged 3.5 million views on November 7 and 6.5 million the next day, she decisively entered the list (at the expense of Che Guevara) to become the second (after Alexander Hamilton) American on the list who had not served as President. The third became Martin Luther King in March 2022 but did not hold on the list until the end of the year.\n\nThe largest gains in 2021 were seen surrounding the British royal family, peaking around the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Even larger gains were seen the next year, peaking around the death of Elizabeth II on September 8th. The Queen saw over 20 million pageviews in the seven days following her death. Earlier in 2022, she had passed Barack Obama for the second place. The September-2022 surge of the royal family caused relegation of Osama bin Laden.\n\nProjecting the trend of the first two decades of Wikipedia (2001–2021) for two more decades, this list would be limited to US Presidents, the British royal family and Hitler.\n\nRank Page Country Views in millions 1 Donald Trump United States 243 2 Elizabeth II United Kingdom 198 3 Barack Obama United States 163 4 Adolf Hitler Nazi Germany 129 5 Abraham Lincoln United States 95 6 Charles III[23] United Kingdom 94 7 Joe Biden United States 91 8 Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh United Kingdom 90 9 Queen Victoria United Kingdom 88 10 John F.

This is a feature of the \"nascent\" Wikipedia. In the course of generations, such top-lists will contain only people who have died,[citation needed] for view-count continues posthumously.\n\nAs of November 2023 Wikipedia counts 1,915,609 people.[17] Of them, 1,075,990 are living,[36] or 56% i.e. the living outnumber the dead. 213,943 more were living in the Wikipedia period,[37] raising the percentage of this period's people to 67 (two-thirds). 341,079 more were living in the century preceding Wikipedia (1901–2000),[38] raising the percentage of the contemporaries to 85. That is, people who lived at some time from the beginning of history until 1900 – 98% of history - constitute only 15%.\n\nAs of 2021, people born since 1960 AD log as many views as people born before, and the year of parity rises every year.[39]\n\nRank Page Time Views in millions 1 Jesus 4 BC − 30/33 AD 59 2 Alexander the Great 356 – 323 BC 55 3 Muhammad 570 – 623 AD 51 4 Julius Caesar 100 – 44 BC 49 5 Genghis Khan 1162 – 1227 AD 44 6 Gautama Buddha 6th – 4th centuries BC 37 7 Aristotle 384 – 322 BC 34 8 Plato 428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC 30 8 King Arthur[a] 5th – 6th centuries AD 30 10 Joan of Arc 1412 – 1431 AD 29 11 Socrates 470/469 – 399 BC 28 12 Spartacus 111 – 71 BC 27 13 Charlemagne 742/748 – 814 AD 26 13 Tutankhamun c. 1341 – c. 1323 BC 26 13 Ragnar Lodbrok[a] 9th century AD 26 13 Augustus 63 BC – AD 14 26 17 William Wallace 1270 – 1305 AD 24 17 Moses[b] 14th – 13th centuries BC 24 19 Nero 37 AD – 68 AD 23 19 Marco Polo 1254 – 1324 AD 23 21 Alfred the Great c. 848-899 AD 22 21 Caligula 12 AD – 41 AD 22 23 Robin Hood[a] 12th – 14th centuries AD 21 24 Cleopatra[c] 69 – 30 BC 20 25 Henry V of England 1386 – 1422 AD 19 25 Hannibal 247 – 183/181 BC 19 25 Abraham[b] 19th – 17th centuries BC 19 28 David 1010 - 970 BC 18 28 Confucius 551 – 479 BC 18 28 Marcus Aurelius 121 - 180 AD 18 28 William the Conqueror 11th century AD 18 28 Ashoka 304 – 222 BC 18\n\nNotes\n\n3rd-millennium people\n\n(December 1, 2007 – January 1, 2023)\n\nOf people born in the 3rd millennium (which is defined here as starting in 2000), the first to receive a personal page in Wikipedia was Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant (born October 25, 2001). Her page was created on August 4, 2003. She was followed by two other princesses later that year: Lady Louise Windsor of Wessex obtained her page on November 26, 2003, at the age of 18 days; the page of Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange, was created on December 9, 2003.\n\nLady Louise Windsor, probably, gained the all-time leadership the following year (2004), as her page was much more viewed during the years we have data (December 2007–present). By the end of 2016, she was 4th in the multiyear list. Lady Louise Windsor was, probably, overcome in 2010 by Willow Smith—the undisputed leader of the 2010s. The page of Willow Smith was created on April 23, 2005 (year and a half after Lady Louise Windsor's). During 2008–2009 the two had similar number of views, while in 2010 Willow Smith counted an extraordinary number of 3,100,000 views.[13] By August 31, 2016, she had total 12 million views, nearly three times more than the closest contender, Jackie Evancho.\n\nIn July 2019, Willow Smith was synchronously surpassed by two people, Billie Eilish and Millie Bobby Brown, after leading over 100 months. Billie Eilish was the first to surpass Smith. On 7/24/2019 Millie Bobby Brown passed Billie Eilish in page views, and held the lead until 7/26/2019. She regained the title on 7/29/2019 and held it until 7/31/2019, and Billie EIlish has held it ever since.[40][41]\n\nThe undisputed leader of the year 2019 was Billie Eilish. She began the year on the 22nd place and gained the all-time lead in July. For 2019, she was the most viewed among living people of all ages and her page was 10th in the general ranking.[42]\n\nIn the 2010s, the hereditary princes were gradually overtaken by the \"princes\" of music and movies.\n\nThe first sportsperson to make this list was artistic gymnast Laurie Hernandez. She entered the list in August 2016, peaked at the 19th rank by the end of the year and dropped from the list in June 2018. She was followed and surpassed by LaMelo Ball in December 2017. LaMelo was joined and surpassed by his colleague, Zion Williamson, in 2019. Williamson peaked at the 14th rank in March 2021, then the highest for a millennial athlete. The forth athlete and the first footballer on the list became Erling Haaland in 2020, followed by his teammate Jadon Sancho the same year. By the end of 2021, Haaland surpassed Williamson for the most viewed millennial athlete and by the fall of 2022 reached rank 4, the highest ever for the millennial athlete.

TreeViews – tool for categories - does not work. The account Wikitop – for top 30 most popular articles by categories is suspended. Multiyear ranking of Wikipedia pages views[13] counts only few selected categories of small number of pages. Practically the only helpful tool for categories is Massview[14] and it also has many limitations. It lacks data before July 2015 and does not work for any category exceeding 20,000 pages, or for any period exceeding a year for categories of over 5000 pages.\n\nWith unarmed eye we can see that the largest category is Content, followed by Articles, followed by Main topic classifications. And this is how far we can see. Calculating a top-30 list with the available tools would require a collective effort of several generations of Wikipedians.\n\nExcluding subcategories and counting pages only, the top-30 list gives Living people and 29 maintenance categories beginning with Articles with short description (4,624,447 pages, most of the Wikipedia).
