        "text": "Infrastructures useful for the development of a territory, car parks also contribute to the preservation of the environment by reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.\n\nWhat is parking?\n\nParking or parking is a place for vehicles to park safely. Located in the main establishments receiving public, near cities, near busy buildings such as airports, train stations, stadiums or shopping centers, car parks are easily identifiable with the symbol \"P\" white against a background of blue. The use of parking spaces is subject to payment depending on the duration of parking. Rates may also vary depending on the type of parking.\n\nThe different types of car parks\n\nThere are generally 5 types of car parks: underground car parks, surface or single-storey car parks, car parks with a largely ventilated superstructure, car parks and car parks. Each type of parking has its advantages and disadvantages. Closed car parks in the basement for example have the advantage of being discreet without impacting the urban landscape. Outdoor car parks are much more economical because they benefit from light and natural ventilation.\n\nEssential equipment for car parks\n\nTo be fully functional, a car park needs many amenities such as access barriers or foot boxes for example. In more modern installations, sophisticated equipment such as the central control unit, the electronic guidance system with presence detection of vehicles on parking spaces or video surveillance are also installed. In addition to these management equipment, a car park must display many signs (indications for access and emergency exits, etc.), floor markings or retractable bollards to better inform users.\n\nFind a cheap parking space\n\nWith Onepark, you can save more than 60% of your parking fees. Among the many offers, choose the parking you need near airports, train stations, stadiums or shopping centers that interest you and book directly online or from your smartphone with the dedicated mobile application."
