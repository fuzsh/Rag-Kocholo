Its main line, 62.4 km (38.8 mi) in length, is built to the 1,000 mm ( 3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge. It connects Montreux, Gstaad, and Zweisimmen. At Zweisimmen, passengers may transfer to the Zweisimmen to Spiez line — a standard gauge line owned by BLS AG. A 12.9 km (8.0 mi) branch-line also connects Zweisimmen to Lenk.\n\nThe main line of the MOB was opened in stages, the first, from Montreux to Les Avants (10.9 km or 6.8 mi) on 17 December 1901, followed by the Les Avants to Montbovon (11.2 km or 7.0 mi) section on 1 October 1903. The next stages from Montbovon to Château-d'Œx (10.6 km or 6.6 mi) and then Gstaad (13.1 km or 8.1 mi) followed on 19 August 1904 and 20 December 1904 respectively, the final 16.6 km (10.3 mi) of the line reaching Zweisimmen on 6 July 1905. The spur line to Lenk was opened in 1912.[1]\n\nFrom the very start, the MOB had the character of a mainline railway and, at an early stage, through trains with dining and saloon coaches were introduced. The creation of the Golden Mountain Pullman Express in 1931 was unfortunately at a time of world economic crisis and this accounted for its lack of success. The saloon coaches 103–106 built for this train by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) were sold to the Rhaetian Railway in 1939, where they are still in use (As 1141–44). Two of the original (1913–14 built) coaches have been restored by the MOB and are used for Chocolate train services in the summer months, but still regularly find work on the main line \"Classic train\" services on Sundays throughout the year. The modern successor of this luxury train is the Golden Pass Panoramic Express, which for the past few years has aroused growing enthusiasm.\n\nThe MOB begins its journey in Montreux, departing trains normally making use of platform 5 and arrivals platform 6, between the Swiss Federal Railway platforms and those of the rack and pinion railway to the Rochers de Naye. Winding its way up through the vineyards above Lake Geneva via Chamby, as far as Les Avants, the line passes through the crown tunnel under the Col de Jaman to reach the Saane Valley. In Montbovon there is a connection to the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF; previously GFM) network. Following the Saane upstream, passing the famous hot-air ballooning centre of Château-d'Oex, it leaves the French-speaking canton of Vaud near Rougemont and enters the German-speaking canton of Bern. After Saanen the planners would have liked a direct ascent of the Saanenmöser Pass but without the aid of a rack and pinion system this was impossible and the line was diverted to loop around the village of Gstaad, adding greatly to the development and prosperity of the community. Beyond Gstaad railway station it begins the climb to the head of Saanenmöser Pass, the highest point on the line at 1,270 m (3,937 ft). On the other side it descends the Simmen Valley to Zweisimmen, where there is a connection to the standard gauge line of the BLS to Spiez.\n\nOver the years, while passenger traffic boomed, freight traffic diminished with 2006 seeing the end of cement transport between Montreux and Saanen and the transport of standard gauge wagons on transporter bogies between Zweisimmen and stations to Rougemont and Lenk. By the end of the year the MOB was a passenger only operation, however in Spring 2007 the company purchased nine gravel (hopper) wagons and two surplus locomotives from the TPF. The MOB now operates this transport from Grandvillard (on the TPF line) to Saanen.\n\nThe Lenk branch retraces this route for a very short distance before continuing on its own trackbed. Because of its poor state of repair, this line was closed on 14 June 1975, however, it was fully modernized between 1977 and 1979, having new tracks and overhead lines, reopening on 27 September 1979. New rolling stock was purchased (* in the list below) to operate this line together with the weekdays school service between Zweisimmen and Saanen. Since reopening it has been included in the regular operating schedule of the MOB with timetabled connections to the main line services. To celebrate the centenary of the opening of the Lenk line (June 2012), the MOB arranged a week of festivities with a dinner, special fares and operation and display of rolling stock usually to be found on museum lines, particularly that at Blonay–Chamby Museum Railway.\n\n(Source: Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, published 24 May 2012)\n\nIn spring 2008, the MOB announced a four-year plan to modernise the railway infrastructure and rebuild stations to bring them all into the 21st century. This programme began with the demolition of little-used facilities: the goods shed in Gstaad and the shed in Château-d'Œx, this latter structure being replaced by a free-standing shelter, for example. During 2008, much work took place on the overhead line equipment, with replacement supports being positioned along the line. Although not brought into use, they stand ready for the new wiring. It is expected that this work will continue up to four nights per week through to December 2009, subject to weather conditions. New deeper ballasting has taken place along many sections of the line and this will be continued until the line has all been done.\n\nThe work at Gstaad consisted of a complete rebuilding of the platforms to full height and simplification of the track layout. After almost 100 years the station received platform canopies and passenger-operated lifts linked by a pedestrian underpass. During this rebuilding the station was reduced to a single line. The canopy is of wooden construction supported on metal uprights. The new layout gives the original platform as No.1 with the new island platform being Nos. 2 and 3. This work was officially opened, if not fully finished, on 13 June 2009.\n\nAt Saanenmöser station, a straightforward relaying and alignment took place through late 2008 to early 2009, which maintained the passing and siding facility at that location.\n\nDuring the early part of 2010, by the end of May, the stations underwent a rebranding along with those of other lines which come under the \"Golden Pass\" banner. All were fitted with signs bearing the new \"Golden Pass\" logo and name alongside the station nameboards, which were retained in their original colours.\n\nOne of the smallest stations and halts (Les Combes, between Château-d'Œx and Rougemont) was given a new raised platform during Autumn 2011, leaving only the waiting shelter as original.\n\nWork commenced on the rebuilding of Château-d'Œx station in mid–September 2013 and plans were published in the local newspaper with details of the work, which was carried out in three phases and completed by the end of 2014. Throughout the work, the passing-loop facility was maintained and raised platforms constructed, reached by subways from the station front. Construction work was delayed and the station officially reopened on 28 November 2015.\n\n(Source : 24 heures, Vaud edition, various dates in April/May 2009)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 1 October 2009)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 12 September 2013)\n\n(Source : Journal du Pays d'Enhaut, 26 November 2015)\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2011 timetable, there are two Golden Pass Panoramic services with VIP domed observation cars, departing Montreux at 9:45 (Train 3118) and 15:45,(Train Nos 2128); the Lenk branch ceases to be served, the \"through\" working only lasting one year (2010). It is normally made up in the following formation and operate in the \"push–pull\" mode:\n\nAst / Brs / As / Locomotive / BDs / Bs* / Arst* : This is the length limit of the train due to platform lengths. Trains may be shorter off-season.\n\nIn the reverse direction, the Golden Pass trains with VIP seating are the 12:26 (Train 2119) and 18:20 from Zweisimmen (Train 2131).\n\nThere are other Golden Pass trains without VIP seating (dome end cars) and these depart Montreux at 7:h45, 11:49, 14:47 and 17:45 (Trains 2112, 2124, 2228 and 2134) and from Zweisimmen at 8:26, 10:26, 14:26 and 17:05 (Trains 2111, 3115, 3123 and 2229). These trains are locomotive hauled and use stock not required for the trains with VIP seating. The formation, which is flexible, is usually as follows:\n\nLocomotive / As / As / BDs / Bs / Bs\n\nThis leaves a surplus of one domed observation car (two in use on the Golden Pass panorama and one on the \"Chocolate Train\")\n\nGolden Pass Classic trains operate daily departing Montreux at 8:47 and 13:45 (Trains 2216 and 3126), returning from Zweisimmen at 11:09 and 16:26 (Trains 2217 and 2127) and are made up in the following formation:\n\nLocomotive / As / As / Brs / Bs / Non-Classic Type BD (to provide cycle / luggage space)\n\nThe Golden Pass \"Chocolate Train\" operates in June, September and October every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and in July and August Monday to Friday, departing Montreux at 9:12 (Train 2118) but no return working is shown in the timetable. Until the end of the 2008 season, it was made up in the following formation which ran throughout between Montreux and Broc Fabrique:\n\nLocomotive / Belle Époque Ars / Belle Époque As / Other vehicles as required (usually Panorama type and/or Non-Classic type BD).\n\nIn the 2009 timetable the formation was changed and operated between Montreux and Gruyere only with a coach connection to Broc (due to operating problems), as follows:\n\nLocomotive (Usually 6003 Saanen, in special Chocolate Train livery) / Belle Epoque Ars / Belle Epoque Ars / Golden Pass Panorama observation car (No. 116 or 117) operating in Push – Pull mode.\n\nOther trains Montreux–Zweisimmen may be pulled by a Ge 4/4, GDe 4/4 or an ABDe 8/8 and they can have up to five coaches.\n\nLocal services operate connecting Montreux to Fontanivent (Mon – Fri ), Chernex, Sonzier and Les Avants, operated by Be 2/6 7001–7004 and from Château-d'Oex, Saanen or Gstaad to Zweisimmen. The branch-line from Zweisimmen to Lenk offers a regular service timetabled to connect into and out of the MOB main line services. These trains are operated by Be 4/4 5001–5004.\n\nFor decades, the traffic on the MOB was handled by electric motor coaches available in four-, six- and eight-axle designs. In 1983, four locomotives of the type GDe 4/4 were bought, to be followed in 1994 by four newer and more powerful Ge 4/4 locomotives from the same manufacturer. These are similar to the ones purchased by the Rhaetian Railway and BAM. Any of these locomotives can be seen working the principal trains.\n\nIn December 2006, the TPF relinquished its freight operations to the SBB Cargo, and its two GDe 4/4 locomotives became surplus to requirements. In April 2007, these were purchased by the MOB and have since been allocated numbers following on from those of their new owners.\n\nThe MOB is run with 900 V DC overhead contact and has gradients of up to 7.3% (1 in 13.5).\n\nNo. Name Class Builders Works No./Date Built Notes. 3 Tm 2/2 KHD 55736-1955 Ex- V22, Euskirchener Kreisbahnen, Germany: Sold 1966 to VGH (Germany) V121. 4 Tm 2/2 1934 Ex-Rhätische Bahn 9913 5 Béa Tm 2/2 Kaelble-Gmeinder 5553-1976 2007 ex-Benkler 25 6 Elsbeth Tm 2/2 Kaelble-Gmeinder 5586-1980 2007 ex-Benkler 26 7 Tm 2/2 1950 Ex-Rhätische Bahn 9914 28 De 4/4 SIG/BBC 1924 Engineers Dept.

This was to include the various railways and funiculars marketed under the \"Golden Pass\" banner and the buses operated by the company. The colour scheme is to be a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) with all stock being rebranded \"Golden Pass\". The new colours will be applied to the stock as it passes through works, although the \"Golden Pass\" logo will be applied as soon as practicable. The first vehicle to be reliveried, First / Second Composite Coach AB307, appeared in traffic on 27 August 2010 (1).\n\n(Source : Journal de Pays d'Enhaut, 1 October 2009)\n\n((1) Source : Journal de Pays d'Enhaut, 26 August 2010)\n\nThe passenger carrying rolling stock can be divided into the categories: \"Classic\", \"Panoramic\", \"Ordinary\" and \"Saanenland\".\n\n\"Classic\" stock are six Pullman type coaches, two from 1914 and four rebuilt in 2004–06 on structures from 1964.

Most \"panoramic\" coaching stock has been built by the former Biel-based coach work builder Ramseier+Jenzer. All coaches are air conditioned. These include:\n\nR+J As 110\n\n1976 As 111\n\n1979 As 112\n\n1982 As 114\n\n1983 Ars 115\n\nnow 228 Ast 116\n\n1985 Ast 117\n\n1986 As 118\n\n1992 As 119\n\n1993 Breda Arst 151\n\n1993 Arst 152\n\n1993 As 153\n\nnow 251 As 154\n\nnow 252 R+J BDs 220\n\n1979 (a) Brs 221\n\n1979 Bs 222\n\n1982 Bs 223\n\n1982 BDs 224\n\n1982 BDs 225\n\n1983 Bs 226\n\n1989 Bs 227\n\n1990 Brs 228\n\n1985/95 Breda Bs 251\n\n1993 Bs 252\n\n1993\n\nType As : First Class saloon coach, Nos. 110, 111, 112, 114, built 1976–83 and 118–119, built 1992–93.

The stock works in conjunction with motor vehicles of type Be 4/4, Nos. 5001–4 and these sets are usually worked as fixed formations of Bt-Be 4/4-ABt, the first being ready for traffic in 2004 was 243-5003-343. 244-5004-344 followed in 2006 and 242-5002-342 left Chernex works for traffic on 20 August 2008. The final unit, No. 241 – 5001 – 341 left Chernex on 7 July 2009 and was seen in Zweissimann two days later having worked a service from Montreux. The driving trailers that replaced ABt 5301-04 are:\n\nType Bt : Second class driving trailer, Nos. 241 to 244.\n\nType ABt: First / Second Composite driving trailer, Nos. 341 to 344.\n\nx43 and x44 were built by Ramseier+Jenzer and fitted with SIG-type bogies, x41 and x42 are built by Raility, the successor company of R+J, and will receive Alstom Centro 1000 bogies with air suspension on delivery.\n\nOn 22 June 2007, the MOB gave details to the press that it had placed orders with Raility of Biel for eight new air-conditioned coaches with large panoramic windows and low-floor access and seating. The coaches will have standard-level seating at the vestibule ends, with a central section of low-floor seating containing the access doors which will assist those with restricted mobility. They will also contain handicapped-accessible toilets. The coaches will be fitted with a new type of bogie \"Centro 1000\" incorporating air suspension, produced by Alstom. The first of these, number Bs230, was delivered from Chernex works into traffic during mid-May 2010. The livery is white all over with the lettering in gold showing the new \"golden pass\" symbol and lettered Transgoldenpass. The blue lettering \"bls\" is also featured. The second coach is expected to be ready for traffic in June 2010. Four of the new coaches will be put between the two halves of ABDe 8/8 4001–4004, forming three-car-EMUs.\n\nThe first of these to enter full revenue–earning service did so in mid-December 2010 when 231 and 232 were formed as a regular part of the \"Golden Pass Panorama\" trains 3118/2119/2128/2131\n\nSource : MOB/Raility press release together with personal observation.\n\nMain article: GoldenPass Express\n\nOn 18 May 2010, MOB invited press and officials to demonstrate the first Panoramic coach (BDs 220) fitted with variable gauge bogies to allow through running across the 1,000 mm ( 3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge / 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge break-of-gauge. The axle-less bogie was developed by MOB and engineered by Prose[2] company of Winterthur. Some components were designed for the Centro 1000 bogie and built by Alstom. Apart from changing the gauge, the bogies also adjust the height of the coaches to suit the different platform heights on the two gauges. MOB announced commercial service with variable gauge trains for 2015.[3] The date of commercial through running Montreux to Interlaken has been postponed several times. Delays in manufacturing due to COVID-19 have been cited in 2020 and 2021. In spring 2021 launch date was set to 11 December 2022.[4][5]\n\nOn 3 January 2018, one of three carriages of a train was blown off the tracks in high winds at Lenk. Eight people were injured.[6]\n\nList of heritage railways and funiculars in Switzerland\n\nList of narrow-gauge railways in Switzerland\n\nMichel Grandguillaume, Gérald Hadorn, Sébastien Jarne and Jean-Louis Rochaix: Chemin de fer Montreux Oberland Bernois.
