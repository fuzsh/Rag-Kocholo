        "text": "There are two different rail services available when taking a journey by train from Basel to Bellinzona.\n\nNo matter which train you take, you will be travelling on a lovely route, which will take you by four lakes; the Zurichsee, the Zugersee, the Lauerzersee and the Luzernsee.\n\nThough south of Fluelen, on the shore of the Luzernsee, these two train services take different routes:\n\n(1) The 'Traverso' (IR) trains still take the older 'classic' and much more spectacular route via Goschenen.\n\nIf you are new to Swiss rail travel, have the time available and the weather is behaving itself, taking these trains is the way to go.\n\n(2) The express services, the IC and EC trains are faster, because they make use of the world's longest rail tunnel, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, which by-passes the most beautiful section of that 'classic' route.\n\nSo these trains will get to Bellinzona quicker, but the journey won't be as wonderful!\n\nDomodossola is in Italy, but because it is at one end of the popular Centovali Railway which crosses back over the border to Switzerland, it is included on the map of Swiss rail routes.\n\nTo enable easy access to the Centovali Railway for those who want to explore Switzerland with a rail pass, the Swiss national operator now provides a direct morning train to Domodossola from Basel.\n\nIf you will be using a Swiss Travel Pass, a Saver Day Pass or valid Eurail and InterRail passes, you can take this IC train and not pay the rail pass reservation fees, which are usually applied to international trains between Switzerland and Italy.\n\nAccessing the fabulous Bernese-Oberland by train is easily done from Basel, thanks to direct trains to the gateway station of Interlaken Ost.\n\nKleine Scheidegg is where connections are available into the trains which travel up to Europe's highest station at Jungfraujoch.\n\nIt's also where connections can be made between the trains operated by WAB, which connect Grindelwald with Lauterbrunnen.\n\nSo if you want to take the gorgeous round trip from Basel, with or without the particularly expensive ascent to Jungfraujoch, is is Kleine Scheidegg that you'll be heading to.\n\nYes the journey from Basel to Wengen requires taking three different trains, but the two connections are as simple as can be, and the second half of the end-to-end trip is astonishingly beautiful.\n\nIf you will be heading to Wengen on a combination of plane + train, the fact you will need to make the transfer by bus from Basel/Mulhouse airport to Basel SBB station, is offset in terms of convenience by the fact that Basel is the only key entry point into Switzerland, which has direct trains to Interlaken.\n\nThe next stage of the ride to Wengen involves taking a train on from Interlaken Ost station.\n\nTaking the train from Basel to Zurich is straightforward as it's a journey which doesn't have to be planned with care.\n\nThere are typically 4 or 5 x trains per hour travelling between the two cities, two or three express trains and two slightly slower InterRegio (IR) trains, which will be cheaper when booking tickets last minute at the station.\n\nWhat does make this route unusual is the variety of trains used for the express (IC) services.\n\nBecause in addition to Swiss trains, TGV trains which have travelled to Switzerland from Paris and ICE trains heading to Zurich and beyond from Germany are also slotted into the timetable.\n\nIn effect they replace one of the Swiss trains in the hours in which they operate, so the national rail operator SBB applies the same conditions of travel to them, as it does to its IC trains.\n\nMeaning that reservations are available, but optional and the type of train being used for a departure has no impact on the ticket price(s).\n\nFor daytime travel there is a daily direct train from Amsterdam to Basel, but if its timings or ticket prices don't suit it can be worth considering a journey which involves a connection in Paris.\n\nThough if you will be travelling with Eurail or InterRail passes taking the direct train will save a lot of money.\n\nIf you would rather travel through the night, there is now a new overnight train available on this route.\n\nBern and Basel are comparatively close to each other, so it's no surprise that they are connected by express trains which typically depart twice per hour until laate\n\nWhat is unusual about this route is that it's also taken by two international services:\n\n(1) the ICE trains and a daily EC which travel beyond Basel to Germany;\n\n(2) EC trains from Italy which are heading to Basel.\n\nThese international services are slotted into the timetable, so in effect their departures are substitutes for the SBB IC trains, which comprise most of the services.\n\nHowever, when booking tickets for these express trains, or using rail passes on this route within Switzerland, it doesn't matter whether you take an Swiss express IC train, or one of these international trains; it is the demand per departure which impacts on the ticket prices and not the type of train being used.\n\nZurich and Basel are comparatively close to each other, so it's no surprise that they are connected by express trains which depart at least once, but often twice per hour.\n\nWhat is unusual about this route is that it's also taken by three international services, which travel beyond Basel:\n\n(1) the ICE trains on the Zurich - Basel - Frankfurt - Hamburg route.\n\n(2) EC trains from Zurich to north-west Germany\n\n(3) TGV Lyria trains on the Zurich - Basel - Paris route.\n\nHowever, when booking tickets for these express trains, or using rail passes on this route within Switzerland, it doesn't matter whether you take an Swiss express IC train, or one of these international trains; ; it is the demand per departure which impacts on the ticket prices and not the type of train being used.\n\nThough if you will be booking tickets last minute at the station, you'll likely save money by taking one of the alternative IR services, they're cheaper, but slower; though by around only 20 minutes."
