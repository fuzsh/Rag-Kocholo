We help transform businesses, societies, and economies, while providing a voice to all who seek quality Web experiences.\n\nW3C members—including the world's major technology companies, universities, government agencies, and non-profit organizations—collaborate under the leadership of Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Dr. Jeff Jaffe. Our community also extends to individuals and non-member organizations through Community Groups, Web Platform Docs, W3DevCampus, public discussion lists, and other activities.\n\nParticipate in W3C\n\nLearn more about W3C\n\nAbout the World Wide Web Foundation\n\nThe Web Foundation seeks to establish the open Web as a global public good and a basic right, ensuring that everyone can access and use it freely.\n\nIn honour of the Web’s 25th Anniversary, the Web Foundation has become a founding partner in the Web We Want campaign. Over the next 12 months, we will engage millions around the world to tell us about their wishes for the Web and then work to build its future together. We'll amplify, support and strengthen local groups, especially in the developing world, allowing everyone, everywhere to define and claim the rights they want to have online both nationally and globally.\n\nJoin the Web We Want Movement\n\nLearn more about the Web Foundation"
