        "text": "Source: Smithsonian Magazine Travels with Rick Steves: Gimmelwald, Switzerland\n\nOn Wed, Sep 1, 2010 Marc Allen wrote: \"Re: VSJ Reunion 2011…Generally, I am thinking that arriving on a Thursday morning, probably at an ungodly hour (as the airlines usually provide), which would allow us to rewind and then gather in the afternoon and evening. Then we could go eating and beer/wine drinking for a couple of days, still departing on Sunday to get home in time for work on Monday. Having two full days in CH gives us the option of catching a train for a day trip to another town (Geneva, Bern, maybe Luzern, even who knows, the Jungfrau?)\".\n\nRegarding that last word, & perhaps as an example of Jungian serendipitous synchronicity, 2 months later, for my birthday, wife Toni sent along a package which contained some travel gifts from Rick Steves, including a Google colleague recommended Rick Steves' Europe All 80 Shows DVD Box Set, as well as a premiere issue magazine Smithsonian Presents Travels with Rick Steves…Europe's Top 20 Destinations, which include in the top 20 a Swiss destination described in an article \"Gimmelwald, Switzerland…Hiking Heidi Country\". The article is joined by a companion video on the DVDs, on Disc 6 Austria & The Alps DVD, Episode 6 \"The Best of the Alps: Switzerland's Jungfrau Region\", whose description reads \"If Heidi is alive, she's in this sky-high corner of the Swiss Alps, with cowbells ringing on breathtaking ridges. After settling into a traditional village where locals scythe hay by hand, we hike and bike [& visit a cheese-making farm]. We blast an alphorn, get sprayed by waterfalls raging deep inside a mountain, and munch müesli for breakfast at 10,000 feet. For a finale, we ride Europe's highest lift up the mighty Jungfrau for hot cocoa, glacier sledding, and oh-wow views\". The disk contains 2 other Swiss episodes, \"Alps of France and Switzerland\" and \"Great Swiss Cities\". Additional travel information is available on Rick's website, including pages on Railpasses and Additional Resources, including overviews of the scene at Gimmelwald, links to websites for Gimmelwald and its inclusive mountain regions such as Schilthorn Piz Gloria, Gimmelwald Hostels and their pages on hikes. Further info is available in Rick's book Rick Steves' Switzerland in the section \"Alpine Retreats\" chapters \"Gimmelwald and the Berner Oberland\" and \"Gimmelwald\", and Appendix chapters \"Communicating\" & \"Transportation\".\n\nPerusing these materials I was struck by how much this region shares in common with cinematic depictions of Shangri-La, with Gimmelwald perched atop a high mountain cliff, in the morning sun a verdant green village encircled by massive circa 10,000 foot alpine peaks, from whose snow-covered tops tumble numerous waterfalls.\n\nThe article notes \"On the mountainside above the Lauterbrunnen Valley, it’s still possible to find Swiss traditions in a 700-year-old hamlet populated by contented goats and hospitable villagers...The traffic-free village of Gimmelwald hangs nonchalantly on the edge of a cliff high above Lauterbrunnen Valley, 30 minutes south of Interlaken by car or train...An ignored station on the cable car ride to the spectacular 9,744-foot peak of the Schilthorn, Gimmelwald might have been overbuilt to the hilt by now but...the farming community managed to reclassify itself as an 'avalanche zone' - too dangerous for development. So…the village's denizens milk their cows and harvest their hay...keeping...traditional culture alive...Take a walk-you can tour the entire village in 15 minutes...There's nothing but air between Gimmelwald and the rock face of the Jungfrau three and a half miles away. Small avalanches across the valley sound like distant waterfalls. Kick a soccer ball too hard and it ends up on the Lauterbrunnen Valley floor, nearly a mile below...Some 130 townsfolk share three surnames...Poor but pleasantly stuck in the past...the village has one creaky hotel, a happy hostel, a decent pension, a guesthouse and a B&B [there's 'even a barn that hikers sleep in when the cows are up on the high meadow']...in 1965 [came]...the cable car...['Schilthornbahn' [\"the world’s longest aerial cable-car system\" -- Rail Europe], which]...connects the valley floor with the mountain communities of Gimmelwald and Mürren on its way to the Schilthorn summit...For the most memorable breakfast around, ride the cable car up the Schilthorn to the peak, capped by [the world's 1st ] revolving restaurant, Piz Gloria...[featured in] the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which the restaurant is blown up...outside...Watch hang gliders [parasailers and wing suit flyers]...jump into airborne ecstasy. While it's possible to hike down from the summit, the first station below it, Birg, is a better jumping-off point for high-country hikes. Two minutes from the Birg station, you'll be completely alone, except for the sound of cowbells and the gurgle of a river. After a steep descent, you'll step out of the forest at the high end of Gimmelwald. Walking over a pastel carpet of gold clover, bellflowers and daisies, you'll find yourself surrounded by butterflies and cheered on by a vibrant chorus of grasshoppers, bees and crickets. If you're interested in the alpine thrills of Switzerland, head for the nearby peaks and ridges (Jungfrau, Kleine Scheidegg or the Schilthorn). But if you're looking for Heidi and an orchestra of cowbells in a Switzerland that you thought existed only in storybooks - take off your boots in Gimmelwald\".\n\nThe video highlights hiking and biking options as well as includes a farm visit that shows the cheese-making process. The transcript adds \"explore the thrilling best of the Alps — in a region called the Berner Oberland. From Interlaken, two valleys lead south: touristy Grindelwald and quieter Lauterbrunnen. From [the] village home base of Gimmelwald...ride lifts up the Schilthorn and Jungfrau...the various lifts [include] cogwheel trains, steep funiculars, or gondolas, the views are breathtaking…[the] gondola drops [passengers off] in the traffic-free village of Gimmelwald....On a sunny day, you understand why people say, \"If Heaven isn't what it's cracked up to be, send me back to Gimmelwald\". The village - established in the Middle Ages, incredibly on the edge of [a] cliff - was one of the poorest places in Switzerland...The village operates like a big family. In fact, most of the 120 residents have the same last name: von Allmen. Collecting grass to get their cows through the winter in this rugged terrain is labor-intensive. Each hardworking family harvests only enough to feed 15 or 20 cows…villagers [thwarting developer's big resort plans] by getting the entire town declared an avalanche zone...[established] From that point on, [that] no one could get permission to build anything bigger than a house or a barn. Unlike neighboring resort towns, Gimmelwald remains a vital community of families - locally owned and proud of it...Most of the buildings house two families and are divided vertically right down the middle...The oldest building in town dates from 1658. Study the log-cabin construction. Many are built without nails...The stones on the huts are there to keep the shingles from blowing off during strong winter storms...In the Alps, get an early start. The peaks are often clear in the morning and then cloud up...riding the Schilthornbahn to the top of the Schilthorn...The Schilthornbahn carries skiers, hikers, and sightseers quick and easy to the 10,000-foot summit of the Schilthorn, where the Piz Gloria station awaits with a restaurant, shop, and panorama terrace...The early ride is discounted enough to pay for a big breakfast in the revolving restaurant, which caps the summit. Breakfast comes with 360 degrees of ever-changing views...While lifts take you to the high points effortlessly, there's nothing like actually hiking. You can gain your altitude by lift and hike from a gondola station on a level trail...Mountain huts are stationed throughout the Alps - often a comfortable day's hike apart. You could hike from France to Slovenia, never come out of the mountains, and every night sleep in a hut...They provide simple meals, hot drinks, and cheap loft beds enabling hikers to enjoy serious hikes without carrying food, sleeping bags and tents...ridge hikes [are] not too high for the cows or the goats...Enjoy the wildflowers including, if they're in season, the much-loved edelweiss - a symbol of the Alps…Mürren...is a typical Swiss resort community - peacefully traffic-free, with hikers in the summer, skiers in the winter, lots of big hotels, cliff-side terrace restaurants, and colorful shops...Mürren is also a good starting point for mountain biking, popular here in the Alps...[for] a half a day...[a] good loop trip [is] from Mürren...to Gimmelwald...- it's down in elevation - [to] Stechelberg, along the bottom of valley floor to Lauterbrunnen, and then you can put [your bike] on the funicular..[& ride] right back into Mürren...using lifts to regain...altitude, most of [the] big loop ride is level or downhill…\n\n…Lauterbrunnen means \"valley of loud waters\"...[in season] the waterfalls are particularly robust. Of the many waterfalls, Trümmelbach is unique because it's actually inside the mountain and offers a behind-the-scenes peek at the power of nature in action...Your Trümmelbach Falls experience starts with an elevator ride. Then, after hiking through some cavernous tunnels, you emerge deep inside the mountain and high above the valley floor. You see the raging river grinding...deeper and deeper into the mountain. The melt water from the region's top peaks - the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau - thunders through this funnel-like gorge at the rate of over 4,000 gallons a second…Exploring this natural wonderland, you come upon great examples of how, in Switzerland, tradition meets the modern world...and survives...[such as the] water wheel - 150 years old...with its [saw mill] blade still powered by a mountain stream. Almost all of the timber in the mountain villages around here was cut in [such] water-powered mills...[meanwhile] Milk cows spend their summers munching the wild herbs and flowers in the high meadows. Their milk is destined to become the treasured Alp cheese, or Alpkäse...Alpine farms - doing their traditional work - welcome hikers and bikers for a peek at the cheese-making action...Each morning [the] licensed and highly trained cheese maker - and [their] crew milk the cows and heat a copper vat of milk over a wood fire. As it slowly curdles, it's stirred at just the right temperature until the consistency is exactly [right]. At just the right moment [the cheese maker] swings the vat off the fire, then quickly dredges the vat with [a] cheesecloth and packs the fresh cheese into frames. This process is repeated every day for 100 days...In the next hut, yesterday's cheese takes a two-day bath in salt brine, and, after a salt rubdown, it's marked \"Alp Cheese\" with a date and number, and set on a shelf to age...Along with the younger Alpkäse, village cheese makers produce Hobelkäse — an older, stronger cheese aged for up to three years. It's named after the Hobel, or wood plane, used to cut it…The only restaurant in town is at the Gimmelwald Pension — a mom-and-pop affair serving basic but tasty alpine cuisine. The menu, which offers local organic produce, changes with whatever the farmers are producing...[a typical] dinner [includes] sausage [of] organic veal, Bratwurst...from...Gimmelwald...[&] fondue [with] Mixed cheese...[the restaurant also offers musical performances &] a chance to hear traditional music...Historically, yodeling and alphorns were a way for distant shepherds, farmsteads, and communities to communicate with one another...[Playing the 8 foot horn] For buglers [is] not that tough. You buzz just as you would when playing a trumpet. Since there are no keys, you get the same notes as a bugle [...which begs the question, could the entrepreneurial next big thing in Gimmelwald be…a karaoke yodeling bar? ;)]\".\n\nAs cars are prohibited in the mountain towns & generally parked in valley town lots at Lauterbrunnen & Stechelberg, the region further offers the full fleet of Swiss transportation options: train, bus, mountain cogwheel train, cable car, gondola, funicular, hikes with safety cables across narrow suspension bridges (via ferrata), year-round skiing, bobsled/tobaggon runs, dog sled, & paraglider flights from mountain top to valley floor. Additionally, \"The village of Lauterbrunnen is set in the world’s largest glacial valley, and is ringed by over 70 waterfalls\". -- travelworks.\n\nTourist Information (TI) Office\n\n\"European Tourist Offices…Just about every European city has a tourist information [TI] office [marked by a street sign that reads \"i\"; for ex. Fribourg's, located right outside the Train Station entrance - as you exit the main entrance, turn right, it's across the street at the \"i\" sign.] located downtown…[also] Each European country has its own official tourism website…For an extensive listing of tourist boards, see www.towd.com …In addition, nearly every European country has a national tourist office in the United States that you can call with specific questions\" - these lattermost links are listed on Rick's webpage \"European Tourist Offices\". Rick has a write-up on TI's in his book \"Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door 2011: The Travel Skills Handbook...Part One: Travel Skills...Travel Savvy...18 Getting Around...Tourist Information Offices\", pgs. 272-4, available for reading via a Google Books Preview.\n\nFood\n\nFor authentic \"indigenous\" Swiss cuisine, Rick's webpage \"What's Cooking in Switzerland\" notes \"the French...favor Raclette, the German...specialty is Rösti...Hobelkäse, a specialty in the Berner Oberland, is a mature (2-3 years old), very finely sliced mountain cheese...[for] Fondue...Rick has his own favorite recipe [for] Gimmelwald Fondue…[for] Raclette...[a] cheese-lover's favorite…[look for it served] with potatoes boiled in their skins, known as Gschwellti...[for] Rösti...not unlike American hash browns...[its] served in many variations. The most popular variety is with a sausage (Bratwurst) and onion gravy [with] the sausage...made from the local pigs kept on the Alps...If you are around Zürich, try the legendary Züri Geschnetzeltes [aka Zürcher Geschnetzeltes (pronounciation (click left speaker icon) Zürcher Geschnetzeltes)] - slices of meat in a cream sauce...Also keep an eye out for seasonal specialties...From September until November, local game (Wild) is in season...ask the locals for the best place to go, as 80 percent of game is imported - only a few eateries, who put a lot of loving care into its preparation, buy it from the local hunters. These restaurant proprietors are often hunters themselves...\". Additionally, a favorite Swiss breakfast, dessert, & even meal, is Müesli, aka Birchermüesli (images, original recipe), consisting of a cereal-like Birchermüesli flake mix base, to which is added milk, apples, other/seasonal fruit, yoghurt, lemon & orange juices & (optionally) cream. The Swiss company Bio-Familia (location) offers the original recipe cereal flake mix, and notes on their website page \"History\" that \"The founder of Birchermüesli...[Swiss] Dr. Maximilian Bircher Benner, born in 1867...placed great emphasis on holistic nutrition and...was convinced of the healing properties of raw fruit and vegetables...In 1904...he put into practice the findings of his research into nutrition. This work resulted, amongst other things, in the recipe for 'Birchermüesli', which would go on to achieve fame throughout the world. The recipe consisted of oat flakes, raw apples, condensed milk, nuts and lemon juice and, using it, Dr Bircher achieved overwhelming improvements in the health of many of his patients...bio-familia AG was founded in 1954...to produce, for a mass market, the successful food developed by Dr. Bircher-Benner\". The site further offers on their page \"Healthy Living\", some Recipes…for the best Swiss Birchermüesli and 10 top tips...for original Birchermüesli. The cereal flake mix is available from Amazon as Bio-Familia Swiss BircherMüesli Original Recipe, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6); to make original recipe Birchermüesli, follow the recipe on the side of the box.\n\nLanguage\n\nIn his book Rick notes, \"Switzerland is at a linguistic crossroads of Europe, with four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh…(an ancient dialect that comes directly from Latin). You'll overhear conversations where one person speaks Italian, the other replies in German, a third butts in with Romansh…The first Swiss (c. 500 B.C) were a Celtic tribe called Helvetii…In 58 B.C the Helvetii were defeated by Julius Caesar...Roman culture thrived in Switzerland for almost 500 years. As Rome fell (c. A.D. 400), Germanic tribes swarmed in…But these tribes never penetrated the nooks and crannies of the most remote mountain areas, and in these regions, particularly in the southeast, people still converse in Romansh, a language that's changed little from the colloquial Latin spoken by the Roman-area occupiers…[in fact, in] canton…Graubünden…[in] the Upper Engadine region…village…Samedan…Romansh remains its first language…[it] arrived with the Etruscans, who were chased here as Rome expanded\". The Wikipedia page Romansh language offers a section \"Some common expressions\", and, to aid pronunciation, YouTube offers a Romansh Phrasebook\".\n\nRestaurants and Accommodations\n\nBetween his book, video and magazine, Rick offers the following recommendations:\n\nRestaurants\n\n(Note: In addition to the Gimmelwald area restaurants listed below, on hikes there are various farms & hiking huts offering meals, which are identified below in the sections \"Activities…Peak Experiences\" & \"Hikes\". Additionally, for varieties of \"the legendary Züri Geschnetzeltes [aka Zürcher Geschnetzeltes]\" (& variations like Kalbsgeschnetzeltes), a few recommended Zürich restaurants are at the end of the list).\n\nGimmelwald\n\n· Pension Gimmelwald \"The only restaurant in town is at the ['Pension Gimmelwald, dishing up good food indoors or out on its glorious view terrace.

Guided Town Walk, by Rick Steves. The page offers an additional 11 local area hikes, as well as a downloadable 2-page pdf hiking map.\n\nRick lists additional hiking adventures, as he writes, \"This area offers days of possible hikes. Many are a fun combination of trails, mountain trains, and cable-car rides. I've listed them based on which side of the valley there on: west (the Gimmelwald/Mürren/Schilthorn side) or east (the Jungfrau side)...[especially of note, on the east side] The super-scenic walk from Männlichen to Kleine Scheidegg is the best of all worlds: It's both dramatic and relatively easy\". Excerpts from a few of the more exceptional hikes follow:\n\nJungfrau (East) Side of the Lauterbrunnen Valley…\"[the hike] Männlichen-Kleine Scheidegg (easy and with dramatic views) - This is my favorite easy alpine hike (2.5 miles, 1.5 hours, 900 foot-foot altitude drop to Kleine Scheidegg.

Locals take their kindergartners on this hike...from the Birg station, hike toward the Schilthorn, taking your first left down and passing along the left side of the little Grauseeli lake [potential attraction to members of Polar Bear Club]. From the lake, a gravelly trail leads down rough switchbacks (including a stretch where the path narrows and you can hang onto a guide cable against the cliff face) until it levels out.

In...September, you can watch cheese being made and have a snack or drink'] and \"Allmendhubel/Mürren to Grütschalp\". Several more hikes are described on the Gimmelwald Hostel page \"Hiking\".\n\nClimbing:\n\nAvailable between Gimmelwald & Mürren is a \"Via ferrata\" (\"road with irons...a mountain route which is equipped with fixed cables, stemples, ladders, and bridges\" -- Wikipedia), as described on the Gimmelwald website page \"Climbing\". For guided tours, \"If you have a bit of climbing experience - and want to get your heart pumping - Klettersteig Via Ferrata [email] provides licensed guides to lead you down a vertigo-inducing via ferrata course (moun­tain climbing on an iron cable) from Mürren to Gimmelwald. Climbers are attached to a 1.4-mile-long steel cable as they traverse sheer cliffs, swinging rope bridges, and impossibly steep lad­ders. Reservations are smart (95 SF includes equipment, minimum 4 people, mid-June-Oct, takes 3 hours, tel. 033-821-6100\". -- Rick Steves Switzerland. Requires hiking gear including hiking boots & via ferrata gear - climbing belt and climbing set (sling with 2 carabiner hooks) and helmet. Gear can be rented from sport shops in Mürren at Stäger Sport's 2 locations (Stäger Sport & Sportzentrum) & in Lauterbrunnen at Alpia Sport.\n\nWaterfall hike: Additionally, there's a unique waterfall hike, when you arrive in the area by train in Lautebrunnen on the valley floor, prior to taking the cable-car to Gimmelwald, available from the Lautebrunnen station, as mentioned above in the video notes, in which video the falls are visited, and described in the video transcript as \"Of the many waterfalls, Trümmelbach is unique because it's actually inside the mountain and offers a behind-the-scenes peek at the power of nature in action...hiking through some cavernous tunnels, you emerge deep inside the mountain and high above the valley floor. You see the raging river grinding...deeper and deeper into the mountain\". In his book Rick writes of the hike, \"If all the waterfalls have you intrigued, sneak a behind-the-scenes look at the valley's most powerful, Trümmelbach Falls (11 SF, daily…Sept - mid-Nov 9:00-17:00…tel. 033-855-3232 [web]… it's about halfway between Lautebrunnen and Schilthornbahn stations (about a 45-minute walk from either one, at a leisurely pace). To save time you can take the PostBus to the falls from either place. Once there, you'll ride an elevator up to the mountain and climb through several caves (wet, with lots of stairs…) to see the melt from the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau grinding...through the mountain at a rate of up to 5,200 gallons a second (that's 20,000 liters-nearly double the beer consumption at Oktoberfest)\".\n\nLastly, about hiking in general, Rick adds \"To do any serious hiking, you should invest in a good hiking map. Hikers can get specifics at the Mürren TI (Tourist Information office] or from hoteliers. For a description of six diverse hikes on the west side of the Lauterbrunnen, pick up the free Mürren-Schilthorn Hikes brochure. This 3-D overview map of the Mürren mountainside makes a useful and attractive souvenir. For the other side of the valley, get the Wandern Jungfraubahnen brochure, which also has a handy 3-D overview map of hiking trails (both brochures free at stations, hotels, and TIs)…[Also available online, (as full screen save-able pdf) are \"Schilthorn Summer Trail Map\", and, with its highest peaks labeled \"Jungfraujoch Top of Europe\", the \"Jungfrau Grindelwald region summer map\", (both available from mappery), as well as basic local area Town plan maps. Additionally, the Swiss TI website MySwitzerland.com, described as \"the official website of the Swiss National Tourist Office\", offers a Hiking iPhone App]\". Rick also offers some notes on wildlife, as he writes \"...keep an eye out for chamois...- the sure-footed 'goat antelopes' that live at the top of the treeline and go a little lower when hungry [ there is a Jungfrau (East) Side Lauterbrunnen Valley Chamois Trail Wengen – Männlichen]…Spotting an ibex - a wild goat with horns, scrambling along the rocky terrain - is another Berner Oberland thrill. You also encounter marmots...You'll hear them whistle. Your best viewing place is above Allmendhubel, in the middle above the highest hut In Blumental [Travelers Alert: There's No Point Arguing With An Ibex] \".\n\nBike:\n\nIn his book Rick writes \"Mountain biking is popular and accepted, as long as you stay on the clearly marked mountain-bike paths. You can rent bikes in Mürren (Stäger Sport ['includes helmet, daily 9:00-10:00…in middle of town. Tel. 033-855-2355'] or in Lauterbrunnen (Imboden Bike [(EN])…'on the main street…daily Sept-June 9:00-18:30 except closed for lunch 12:00-13:00…tel. 033-855-2114'…]. The Lauterbrunnen shop is bigger, has a wider selection of bikes, and is likely to be open when the Mürren one isn't. On trains and cable cars, bikes require a separate ticket (cost the same as a person). As noted earlier in Rick's video transcript, \"Mürren is also a good starting point for mountain biking, popular here in the Alps...[for] a half a day...[a] good loop trip [is] from Mürren...to Gimmelwald...- it's down in elevation - [to] Stechelberg, along the bottom of valley floor to Lauterbrunnen, and then you can put [your bike] on the funicular...[and ride] right back into Mürren...using lifts to regain...altitude, most of [the] big loop ride is level or downhill\". In his book Rick describes \"the most popular bike rides\", and proceeds to list 5. The location of the Lauterbrunnen bike rental & TI (Tourist Information) office is shown at pushpin 13 & the \"i\" icon near pushpin 11 respectively on the map Lauterbrunnen, while Mürren's bike rental is mid-town on the map Mürren.\n\nFly (Paraglide)\n\nThe Gimmelwald website page Paragliding notes \"The Jungfrau region and especially the Gimmelwald/Mürren/Schilthorn area is optimal for…this sport.

A Google search found one within the Berner Oberland, as described in an article on myswitzerland.com titled \"Little mushers gain momentum…Engstligenalp - Adelboden\" that notes \"He lives with his dogs in an igloo and welcomes guests, who share his passion for dog-sledding: The \"Swisskimo\" Markus Röthlisberger offers dog-sledding adventures…get to know the world of huskies...An incredible adventure!\". Noting the write-up was located in the winter sports section of the site, but knowing that various winter sports like skiing are offered year round in Switzerland, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask about September options. I visited Markus' website Swisskimos [EN] (Markus Röthlisberger, +41 (0) 79,433 28 06, +41 (0) 78,662 92 22, kontakt@swisskimos.ch), & spotted on its page \"Offer\" a link \"Passenger trips\" listing the offering \"Long trip: Children 50. -- Adult 70. -- approx. 1/2 hr. with Iglu visit\", with payment details described on the page \"AGB\", and so composed an inquiry e-mail, translated into passable German using Google Translate, subject \"Hundeschlitten, Passagierreise, im September 2011?\" (Dog sled, passenger trip, in September 2011?), sent it off and the next day got, from Swisskimos team member Muriel, in colloquial English, a reply, followed by several more back-and-forth emails, in which Muriel writes, \"Hi Cliff…We would carry out the program. However, it has no snow in September 2011, guaranteed on Engstligenalp. We still do not know whether we are again in September 2011 on the mountain. We live in the summer and autumn in Eriz.

The locations of Eriz, (aka Inner-Eriz) & Engstligenalp-Adelboden are shown at the top center (north) & bottom left (southwest) corner respectively, of the Berner Oberland Overview Map.

A visually stunning view of the Berner Oberland, looking south from Interlaken up the Lauterbrunnen Valley, with the 13,647-foot peak of the Jungfrau on the left (East) & 9,744-foot peak of the Schilthorn on the right (West), is presented on the Jungfrau Grindelwald region summer map. An equally impressive scene, from the Lauterbrunnen Valley floor, looking west up at Gimmelwald towards the Schilthorn summit, is shown on the Schilthorn Summer Trail Map. In his book Rick writes \"two areas … tower above either side of the Lauterbrunnen Valley...On one [East] side is the Jungfrau (and beneath it, the towns of Wengen and Kleine Scheidegg), and on the other [West] side is the Schilthorn (overlooking the villages of Gimmelwald and Mürren)...Ideally, spend three nights in the region, with a day exploring each side of the valley. For the fastest look, consider a night in Gimmelwald, breakfast at the Schilthorn [revolving restaurant Piz Gloria], an afternoon doing the Männlichen-Wengen hike [Rick's 'favorite easy alpine hike…on the Jungfrau (East) Side of the Lauterbrunnen Valley'], and an evening or night train out\".\n\nGetting Around in the Berner Oberland\n\nIn his book Rick adds \"For an overview of your many options, study the [map Berner Oberland and] Alpine Lifts in the Berner Oberland...Lifts generally go at least twice hourly, from about 7:00 until about 20:00\".

My wife Toni found a traveling couple's website that documents their car journey from Zürich to Gimmelwald, offers photos, audio, video, and maps, includes views of the Schilthornbahn Piz Gloria cable-car station & ride up to Gimmelwald, as noted in a description that reads \"In Zurich we picked up a rental car and drove the 122 miles to Gimmelwald...We parked in the cable car lot, rode…about 1,500 feet up the mountainside...and walked the rest of the way to Walter's hotel\", on their webpage Europe 301 - Gimmelwald.\n\nIncluded in Rick's write-up is a handy Driving: Distance & Time map.

I hop on just about any train going my way and flash my pass when the conductor stops by. Railpasses are available in more varieties than ever. Savvy travelers do their research to figure out which pass will work best for their trip. Passes generally are not sold in Europe; travelers get them from travel agents before leaving home. Rather than the all Europe pass, we're using a pass that covers fewer countries. And most train passes come in consecutive-day, or flexible-day versions. Rather than getting a pass offering, for example, 15 days in a row, we're saving money with a flexipass. We bought five days, to be used a day here and a day there, as we need them, within a two month period\". Rick offers detailed pass info on his webpages Railpasses and \"Regional Passes...Switzerland\". Additional railpass info is contained in Rick's book which reads \"Save on Sightseeing with...the Swiss Pass [provides the Swiss Rail Pass from the Swiss Travel System] - offering consecutive-day or flexi-day coverage of Switzerland's trains, boats, and buses, and a 50 percent discount on lifts-also covers [free] admission to more than 400 Swiss museums...The Swiss Pass doubles as a Swiss Museum Pass…[but note] If you have a flexipass, visiting a museum can use up a day of your pass.

Following up on Rick's note above, \"Savvy travelers do their research to figure out which pass will work best for their trip\", in the book's \"Appendix\" chapter \"Transportation\" is a summary of the different pass types which reads, \"Swiss Railpasses...because of high ticket prices, rail passes are a good deal in Switzerland, even for a three-day trip.

This can save you money if your Swiss travel adds up to more than $200 in point-to-point tickets\n\nSwiss Card is a variation on [the Half-Fair Travel Card], sold only in the US and at a few [Swiss airports and] border stations.

Sold only outside Switzerland\n\nRailpass Bonuses and Discounts...if you buy a railpass, know what extras are included-for example, boat cruises on the big Swiss lakes are covered by most rail passes. In addition, Swiss railpasses can get you free entry to many museums and discounts on many mountain lifts. Always ask...If your railpass is a flexipass (it covers a number of days in a given span, rather than consecutive days), it's worth knowing when, and when not, to use of your flexi-days. Trips that are merely discounted, rather than free with the pass-most notably many mountain lifts-don't use up a day of your pass. Any time you use the pass for a free trip, however, it counts as using a flexi-day. This can be fine and cost-effective if you're already using the pass to cover other transportation that day. But if you've got no other use for your pass that day than your \"free\" trip (such as a short boat or train ride), it can make sense to pay out-of-pocket for it rather than use up a valuable day of your flexi-pass. If you have a Swiss flexipass...note that when you're not using a travel day, your pass gets you a 50% discount on all rides taken before the use of your last travel day. Unlike flexipasses for most countries, a Swiss flexipass expires once you've used up all your travel dates-even if that's well before the end of the one-month timeframe noted on your pass. It can be smart to use your first travel date of the beginning of your trip, and your last travel day near (or at) the end of your trip; then you can use your flexipass throughout your entire trip for transportation discounts on the dates you're not using travel days\".\n\nPublic Transportation Tickets \"Best Bet/Deal\" Summary: For 1 & 2 people travelling between Zurich-Fribourg-Jungfrau/Schilthorn, as shown on Rick Steves webpage \"Switzerland Rail Passes\" the Swiss Flexipass (1 person, 1st/2nd Class) & Swiss Flexipass Saver (2 persons, 1st/2nd Class) offer 100% coverage on all trains & busses 3-6 days/month (with half-price discount on most high-mountain trains and lifts), while both the Holiday Pass (West side Lauterbrunnen Valley (Gimmewald...Schilthorn; Area/Lines Covered) & Jungfraubahnen Pass (East side Lauterbrunnen Valley (Wengen...Jungfrau; Area/Lines Covered) are roughly ⅓ - ½\n\noff when purchased with Swiss Flexipass & offer 100% coverage for 6 days unlimited travel on all high-mountain trains and lifts, suggests the combination of Swiss Flexipass/Saver with Holiday Pass & Jungfraubahnen Pass may be the best deal for the Zurich-Fribourg-Jungfrau/Schilthorn traveler - to verify if this is the case, check on it at a Tourist Information (TI) office (Zürich Airport (upper level), Fribourg (adjacent train station), Jungfrau region (Lauterbrunnen, Mürren (list)).\n\nRick's write-up includes a Swiss Public Transportation map, & on his website a chart \"Comparing Swiss Pass Coverage\", and charts of current ticket prices for all pass types, which tickets can be ordered online, as well as a map titled \"Compare Ticket Costs Map\" that \"shows point-to-point, one-way, 2nd-class rail fares in $US\", on the rail/regional webpage at Switzerland.

Most hotels offer Wi-Fi for free; others charge by the minute\".\n\nTelephones\n\n\"Dialing Domestically in Switzerland...Switzerland has a direct-dial phone system (no area code). To call anywhere within Switzerland, just dial the number. For example the number for a Gimmerwald hotel...is 033-855-1658. To call it from Zürich's train station, just dial [it]...if you call from Gimmerwald's cable-car station, it's the same\".\n\n\"Dialing Internationally to or from Switzerland...If you want to make an international call, follow these three steps:\n\n1. Dial the international access code (00 if you're calling from Europe, 011 from the US or Canada)\n\n2. Dial the country code of the country you're calling [41 for Switzerland] (see [Rick's webpage Telephone Tips section…] European Calling Chart)\n\n3. Dial the entire phone number, keeping in mind that calling many countries [including Switzerland] require dropping the initial zero of the area code or local number [for example as shown in the following paragraph]…(the European Calling Chart lists specifics per country [same for landline or mobile phone])\".\n\n\"Calling from the US to Switzerland: To call from the US to the recommended Gimmerwald hotel [033-855-1658], dial 011 (the US international access code), 41 (Switzerland's country code), then 33-855-1658 (the hotel's number without its initial zero)\".\n\n\"Calling from Switzerland to the US: To call from Gimmerwald to [Rick's] office in Edmonds, Washington [dial] 00 (Europe's international access code), 1 (the US country code), 425 (Edmond's area code), and 771-8303\".\n\n\"Note: You might see a + in front of a European number. When dialing the number, replace the + with the international access code of the country are calling from (00 from Europe, 011 from the US or Canada)\".\n\nFor additional info see Rick's webpage Telephone Tips.\n\nPhone Cards:\n\n\"You'll find two types of prepaid phone cards in Switzerland: insertable (best for local calls, but work only in public pay phones) and international (best for calling home)\".\n\n\"Insertable Phone Cards: an insertable, prepaid \"Taxcard\" allows you to dial from any public pay phone, as most Swiss phone booths no longer accept coins. Simply take the phone off the hook, insert the card, wait for a dial tone, and dial away. The price of the call is automatically deducted while you talk, and at the end of your call, the phone will helpfully beep to remind you to remove your card and will show the card balance…These cards are sold at post offices and many newsstand kiosks and gas stations in 5-SF, 10-SF, and 20-SF denominations (because cards work only in Switzerland-and are occasionally duds-avoid the pricier ones)\".\n\n\"International Phone Cards: These are the cheapest way to make international calls from Europe-with the best cards it costs literally pennies a minute, and they can be used from any type of phone (but if calling from the hotel, make sure you won't be charged for a toll-free call). These cards also work for local calls, but aren't likely to beat the local rates you'll get at a pay phone...these cards are sold all over; look for them at many post offices, newsstands, mini-marts, and exchange bureaus. Ask the clerk which of the various brands has the best rates for calls to America. Some cards are rechargeable (you can call up the number on the card, give your credit-card number, and buy more time). Some shops also sell card list codes, printed right on the receipt...to use the card, scratch to reveal your code (or locate the code on your receipt), then dial the free access number. Following the recorded instructions, enter your code, then dial the number you're calling. Usually the prompts are in fairly concise English, but if not, experiment: Dial your code, followed by the pound sign (#), then the number, then [#] again, and so on, until it works. Sometimes the star (*) key is used instead of the [ #]…remember that you don't need the actual card to use a cart account, so it's shareable. You could write down the access number and code in your notebook and shared with friends\".\n\n\"US Calling Cards: These cards, such as the ones offered by AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint, are the worst option. You'll nearly always save a lot of money by using a locally purchased international phone card instead\".\n\n\"Public Phones and Hotel-Room Phones: Swisscom public pay phones are easy to find, especially at train stations and post offices. Most take only insertable phone cards though a few take coins as well. Local calls cost 0.50 SF for the first minute, then 0.04-0.08 SF/min after (calls are cheapest outside business hours; calling mobile phones is pricier). International calls are more expensive (about 0.35 SF/min), so if you'll be calling home a lot, an international phone card can save you money...calling from yourhotel-room phone can be cheaper local calls (as for the rates at the front desk first), but are usually a rip off for long-distance calls, unless you use an international phone card\".\n\nFor additional info see Rick's webpage Public Phones, Hotel-Room Phones and Phone Cards.\n\nMobile Phones\n\n\"Using Your Mobile Phone: Your US mobile phone works in Europe (if it's GSM-enabled, tri-band or a quad-band) and on a calling plan that includes international calls. For example, with a T-Mobile phone, you'll pay $1 per minute to make or receive a call, and about $0.35 apiece for text messages...you can save money if your phone is electronically \"unlocked\"-then you can simply buy a SIM card (a fingernail sized chip that stores your phones information) in Europe. SIM cards, which give you a European phone number, are sold at mobile-phone stores and some newsstand kiosks for about $5-$10. When you buy the card, you also get some prepaid calling time (25 SF gives you about 75 minutes). Simply insert the SIM card…always ask about fees for domestic and international calls, roaming charges, and how to check your credit balance and buy more time...Many smartphones, such as the iPhone or Blackberry, work in Europe-but beware of sky-high fees, especially for data downloading (checking e-mail, browsing the Internet, watching videos...). Ask your provider in advance how to avoid unwittingly \"roaming\" your way to a huge bill. Some applications allow for cheap or free smartphone calls over a Wi-Fi connection (described below at Calling over the Internet)\".\n\nOn his website Rick adds...\n\n\"Mobile Phones 101...If you venture outside your mobile phone's home area, you're roaming. Making calls when you're roaming in a foreign country can be expensive. To avoid high roaming fees, some Europeans switch SIM cards as they cross borders. (The EU regulates roaming fees within their territory — but if you're roaming with a non-EU SIM card, it could be pricey.)...\n\n\"American Phones...Many T-Mobile or AT&T phones work fine abroad, while only specialized phones from Verizon or Sprint do — check your operating manual (look for \"tri-band\" or \"quad-band\"), or ask your mobile-phone service provider. You might have to go into your phone's menu and manually switch it from the American band to the European one, but most phones automatically detect the change. Your mobile-phone service provider likely has an international plan, which allows you to roam throughout Europe using your home phone number. Most US providers charge $1.29 per minute to make or receive calls, and 20 to 50 cents to send or receive text messages, with no additional fees. A few caveats: Note that you'll be charged for incoming calls, even if you don't answer them (and, in some cases, even if your phone is turned off) — so tell your friends and co-workers not to call except in emergencies. And recently, owners of some newer wireless devices (such as iPhones) have been surprised with huge bills for unwittingly roaming — such as when the phone constantly checks for new emails. (This default Internet data-roaming feature can be turned off to avoid per-kilobyte charges, which add up fast.)\"\n\n\"European Phones...Be aware that if you're having people call you on your European mobile phone number, it's typically much more expensive (even double) for them than calling a fixed line. Your loved ones back home might save money phoning you at your hotel, rather than calling your mobile phone\".\n\n\"Buying SIM Cards...it's worth the extra time to go to a mobile phone shop, where an English-speaking clerk can help you explore your options, get your SIM card inserted and set up, and show you how to use it. Note that some mobile phone shops sell SIM cards for only one provider, while others offer a wide range. Unless you're certain you want a particular company, look for a place that gives you several options, then ask the clerk which one is best for the types of calls you're going to make. (Mostly domestic or international calls? Are you using it only in that country, or planning to \"roam\" with it across a border?) The mobile phone desk in a big department store is another good place to check...When you buy the SIM card, ask for a list of calling rates: for making phone calls and sending text messages — both domestic and international — and for roaming (if you'll be leaving the country). If you're calling from the SIM card's home country, you'll generally pay around 10–20 cents per minute for domestic calls to fixed lines, and nothing to receive calls. Calls to the US can cost $1 per minute or more — but using an international phone card with your mobile phone can bring that cost down to pennies...A SIM card works most affordably in the country where you buy it. If you roam with the SIM card in another country, call prices go up, and you pay to receive incoming calls. If your SIM card is from an EU country (if en route to Zurich there's a stopover at The Netherlands Amsterdam airport & the card procured there), fees are regulated when roaming within the EU: You'll pay no more than about 60 cents per minute to make calls, or 25 cents per minute to receive calls. If your SIM card is from a non-EU country — or if you're traveling in one — roaming fees can be much higher. If you'll be making a lot of calls, it can be cheaper to buy a new SIM card for that country...When you first insert a new SIM card, you might be prompted to enter the \"SIM PIN\" (a code number that came with your SIM card). In some cases, you'll be asked for this every time you turn on the phone — which can be a hassle. Fortunately, this feature can usually be disabled; look through your phone's menu and security features, or ask the shop clerk for help...Text messages and other instructions from the service provider are generally in another language. It's often possible to switch this to English — again, get help from the shop clerk...Be sure you know how to check your remaining credit balance. This is different for each phone company, but generally you'll enter a three-digit number, then #, then hit \"send.\" The remaining amount should pop up on your screen. You can buy additional prepaid credit as you go: Buy a printed voucher from that provider at a mobile-phone shop or newsstand, then punch in the numbers from the voucher to add the time to your phone...Before leaving the shop, go through the entire process, from turning on the phone, to checking your credit balance, to actually making a call — to the store, or, for fun, to the shop clerk's personal phone...Traveling with a Mobile Phone in Europe...Remember to store your phone numbers in the phone itself, rather than on the SIM card - or you'll lose access to them when you switch SIMs. When storing phone numbers, include the plus (+) sign and the country code so your calls will go through, regardless of where you're calling from\". For additional info see Rick's webpage Mobile Phones and Smart Phones in Europe.\n\nInternet:\n\n\"Calling over the Internet...if you're traveling with a laptop, you can make calls using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). With VoIP, two computers act as the phones, and the Internet-based calls are free (or you can pay a few cents to call from your computer to a telephone). The major providers are Skype…and Google Talk\".\n\nOn his website Rick adds, \"Be Smart About Smartphones...Smartphones, such as the iPhone, Blackberry, and Android, often work in Europe — but at a cost. Upon returning home, some users have been surprised with huge data-roaming bills for browsing the Internet or even simply for receiving emails. With the iPhone, you pay nearly 2 cents per kilobyte downloaded in Europe. This means you'll pay about $40 to watch a three-minute video clip from YouTube or email a large digital image (either of which is around 2 megabytes). While downloading a few emails (figure around 20 cents to send or receive a basic message) and doing some casual Internet browsing doesn't involve such large kilobyte loads, these charges can add up fast. (The EU is imposing stricter regulation of data-roaming fees, which will reduce the cost in the future.)...If you have an iPhone, you can pay extra for an international data-roaming plan; however, it's still quite expensive (e.g., $25 per month to download up to 20 megabytes in 90 countries, including many in Europe). Better yet, simply turn off the data-roaming feature in the iPhone's menu. You can still access the Internet and download emails by getting online at public Wi-Fi hotspots (sometimes free, sometimes for a fee). It's also wise to turn off the \"fetch new data\" feature, which automatically synchs your device with your email account and calendar. You can still synch these items manually when you find Wi-Fi. My foolproof solution is to simply remove the SIM card from my iPhone. I can still get online with Wi-Fi, but my iPhone completely loses its phone capabilities...it basically becomes an iPod Touch...The technology is evolving quickly, and more affordable solutions are popping up all the time. For example, Skype and other calling applications allow your Wi-Fi-connected iPhone to make cheap or free calls over the Internet [using VoIP services Skype & Google Talk on laptop/netbook/tablet or at Internet café, or from certain Internet-enabled mobile/smartphones (including iPhone; Skype's also available for some other smartphones), or via third-party services like Fring (Skype-to-mobile-phone gateway), Vonage (Internet calls via fixed-line phone) & Rebtel (cheap Internet international same number phone calls) are described at Calling over the Internet.\n\n\"[Web access…as an alternative to Wi-Fi hotspots & hotel room Ethernet RJ45 plug Internet cables, is a 'cellular modem', described on Rick's website where he writes] 'Getting Online with Your Laptop or Netbook...For those who want constant access in one country, cellular modems (also known as wireless modems or mobile broadband) may be the way to go. A mobile phone company routes your Internet connection over its 3G network. Usually you buy a 'dongle' — it looks like a USB flash drive — that you insert into your laptop's USB slot. If you need more consistent Internet access than scattered Wi-Fi hotspots will provide, this could be a good option. [For example] In the UK, Vodafone offers a pay-as-you-go package with 90 hours of browsing for about $40. T-Mobile has similar plans in the UK and Germany'\".\n\nAnother option besides cable modem is Wi Fi tethering, the facility to use your phone as a mobile wireless router Wi-Fi hotspot, if your mobile phone supports it. Among promising new phones that do is a Google phone, the Nexus S, recently reviewed on TechCrunch which writes, \"Google Nexus S, manufactured by Samsung, with the new Android 2.3 'Gingerbread' operating system...this phone [is] available at Best Buy in the U.S. (on T-Mobile) and Carphone Warehouse in the U.K...Battery life is good...We’ve been getting 6+ hours of heavy voice/data usage on the removable 1500 mAh Lithium Ion battery...The phone has both a rear facing 5 megapixel camera, with a flash, as well as a VGA front facing camera. Both performed well. The phone also has a gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, proximity sensor, haptic feedback...light sensor...16 GB of internal flash memory...[&]...Wifi, GPS and bluetooth all behaved flawlessly...the Nexus S has Near Field Communication (NFC) built in [which in the near future] will allow you to use your phone in place of a credit card by simply tapping the phone against special sensors in retail stores. NFC will also allow for phones to swap data between each other with a minimal amount of hassle...Google’s noise cancellation software is also present...So far, not one dropped call....The Nexus S comes with the Google Voice app pre-installed...[&] old crowd-pleasers like the on-the-fly creation of Wi-Fi hotspots...Gingerbread also supports VoIP/SIP calling...Michael is leaving today for a week in Europe, and taking only this phone with him. The fact that it’s unlocked means he can add a sim card on"
