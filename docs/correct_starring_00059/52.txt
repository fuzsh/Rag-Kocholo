Victor Spinetti has died at the age of 82.

The actor, who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, was known for his performances in The Beatles' movies A Hard Day's Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.

The band had asked him to appear in their first film after his performance in Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop Oh, What a Lovely War!, which later transferred to the West End and Broadway, where he won a Tony Award.

Spinetti later co-wrote and directed a stage adaptation of John Lennon's In His Own Write.

He went on to appear in many films, including Andrew Sinclair's Under Milk Wood, which also starred Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter O'Toole.
