        "text": "“Why?” Spinetti replied taken aback.\n\n“Because if you’re not in them, me mum won’t come and see them,” explained Harrison. “She fancies you.”\n\nAnd so began Spinetti’s career defining relationship with the Fab Four in which he was the only person besides The Beatles themselves to appear in three of their movies – A Hard Day’s Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nHe also appeared on one of The Beatles’ Christmas recordings and in 1968 co-wrote the play In His Own Write based on Lennon’s books which opened at London’s Old Vic Theatre.\n\nYet Spinetti proved to be much more than simply the Beatles mainstay, winning a Tony Award in 1965 for reprising his role in Oh What A Lovely War when it transferred to Broadway and appearing in more than 30 films, alongside stars such as Laurence Olivier, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Peter Sellers, and in countless stage plays.\n\nThe eldest of six children, Vittorio Georgio Andrea Spinetti was born in Cwm in south Wales to Giuseppe and Lily who owned the local chip shop.\n\nHe was educated at Monmouth School and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, where he later became a fellow.\n\nThis is also where he met his partner, the actor Graham Curnow who died in 1997.\n\nHaving moved to London he made his West End debut in 1958 playing four different roles in Expresso Bongo at the Saville Theatre.\n\nA year later Spinetti joined Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop where he performed in numerous productions here and in the US including Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be, The Hostage, Oliver!, The Odd Couple and Chitty Chitty Bang Lives remembered Bang. His film credits included Franco Zeffirelli’s The Taming Of The Shrew, Voyage Of The Damned, The Return Of The Pink Panther and The Krays.\n\nBut he continued to show his versatility starring opposite Sid James in the Sixties TV comedy Two In Clover and as the Mad Jaffa Cake Eater in a TV ad campaign.\n\nHe also provided the voice for arch villain Texas Pete in the animated series, SuperTed.\n\nIn the Seventies he turned to directing musicals, including Hair in Amsterdam and Rome, and Jesus Christ Superstar in Paris. In 1980 he directed The Biograph Girl, a musical about the silent movie era at London’s Phoenix Theatre, and later toured in his own one-man show A Very Private Diary. He also wrote poetry, notably Watchers Along The Mall, and prose which have appeared in several publications.\n\nFollowing the news of his friend’s death from cancer Sir Paul McCartney praised Spinetti’s “irreverent wit and exuberant personality”.\n\nHe added: “I will miss his loyal friendship, as will all the others who were lucky enough to know and love"
