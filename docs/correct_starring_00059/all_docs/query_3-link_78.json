        "text": "In October 1963 Brian Epstein was approached by United Artists film company to make a film with the Beatles. United Artists thought making a low budget motion picture starring them would be a good money-making exercise for the company. Even though the Beatles had yet to go to there, they knew that any soundtrack album produced would be released by United Artists own record label in the US. A very modest budget of £200,000 set aside for the making of the movie.\n\nRichard Lester, an American based in London, was chosen to direct it. He had made the experimental short comedy The Running, Jumping, Standing Still Film with Spike Milligan. The Beatles were big fans of the film and Lester seemed the perfect choice.\n\nAlun Owen, who had written a TV play based in Liverpool called ‘No Trams to Lime Street’, was appointed to write the script. Owen was asked to join the Beatles in Ireland to see what the Beatles were like as people, and the mania surrounding them. He decided the film should reflect the impact of ‘Beatlemania’ and how the Beatles were prisoners of their own success.\n\nThe final title came about when John Lennon was talking to producer Walter Shenson about Ringo Starr’s misuse of the English language. After a hard day, Ringo would slump into a chair, and noticing it was now night-time would say ‘It’s been a hard day’s night’. At which point they looked at each other and knew they had the title for the film. John and Paul then had to write a song with that title, which was recorded by the Beatles on 16th April, and the film title announced to the press the next day.\n\nFilming for A Hard Day’s Night finished on 24th April 1964 – after which the Beatles went on a world tour. They were back in time for the Premiere at the London Pavilion cinema on 6th July 1964. It was a Hard Day’s Night!\n\nAfter the worldwide success of A Hard Day’s Night, the Beatles made a second film in 1965. The budget for the film was far greater than for A Hard Day’s Night and made in colour (“Green” John Lennon joked)\n\nLike their first film, it took a while for the final title to be decided. When Ticket to Ride was released as a single in the US, the record label said it was ‘From the film ‘Eight Arm’s to Hold You’. That title was of course later changed to Help!\n\nAs they had already made a movie which was shot like a documentary, director Richard Lester knew he had to do something very different. Instead, writer Charles Wood wrote a story around a ring that Ringo is sent by a fan. The trouble is anyone caught wearing the ring is likely to be sacrificed to the ‘Dreaded Kaili’ – an Eastern religious sect.\n\nMany famous British comedy actors star alongside the Beatles, including Victor Spinetti, who had also appeared in A Hard Day’s Night. After their first film, George Harrison said to Victor, “You’ve got to be in all our films, my Mum fancies you!”\n\nOther well actors who appeared in Help! included Leo McKern, who played the head of the Dreaded Kailli, and Eleanor Bron. In fact, the other characters dominate the movie so much, that John Lennon once said that the Beatles felt like extras in their own film.\n\nThe Beatles had discovered marijuana just before they made the film, and John Lennon once said that all the best bits, with the Beatles falling around stoned, ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nLike its predecessor, Help! did very well at the Box Office and is now out on DVD.\n\nAs Help! had a much bigger budget than A Hard Day’s Night, many more exotic locations were used. As well as chasing the Beatles around London, the Dreaded Kailli follow them to Austria and the Bahamas.\n\nAs A Hard Day’s Night, the interiors were shot at Twickenham Film Studios – and other scenes shot in streets nearby. For instance, when each Beatle are seen going into four separate doors, that scene was shot in Ailsa Avenue, Twickenham, about a mile from the studios.\n\nAttempts to cut the ring off Ringo’s finger are made in South Western Road and Winchester Road, close to the Turks Head pub, which features in A Hard Day’s Night.\n\nAt one point in the film the Beatles takes refuge in Buckingham Palace. That scene was actually shot at Cliveden, then the family home of the Astors.\n\nMagical Mystery Tour was a TV film, written, directed by, and starring the Beatles.\n\nThe original idea for it was Paul McCartney’s. On a flight from the US to the UK in April 1967 he sketched out his plan on a piece of paper. He drew the film as a circle divided in segments, with some already filled in with his ideas of what should be done when – and who with. The other Beatle were asked to come up with ideas for the blank segments.\n\nThe main inspiration for Magical Mystery Tour were partly the acid-fuelled adventures of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who had travelled across America in a psychedelic painted bus, and alcohol fuelled coach tours from Liverpool to see the Blackpool illuminations.\n\nThe title song was recorded by the Beatles on 25th April 1967 – but filming didn’t begin until 11th September. In between time the Beatles had released Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, and recorded All You Need is Love in front of a worldwide TV audience of 400 million people. However, the Beatle manager, Brian Epstein, died of an accidental drugs overdose on 27th August, and Paul McCartney suggested that the Beatles should start work almost immediately on their new film. He feared that if they didn’t, and went to India to study with the Maharishi, as was also suggested, they would never work again.\n\nThe film had no plot or written script. Instead, the Beatle and the cast made up scenes as they went along. Amongst those taking part was Victor Spinetti, now a firm friend of the Beatles, and making his third appearance in one of their films. Apart from the Beatles, music was provided by the cult band Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, who was seen backing a stripper.\n\nOf all their films, Magical Mystery Tour showed exactly was in the Beatles’ minds at that time – albeit rather influenced by LSD. Because there was no script or running order, the film took much longer to edit than it did to shoot.\n\nIn the end, the film was sold for broadcast on BBC television. It seems that the BBC scheduled it’s showing without watching it, and it was shown on BBC1 on Boxing Day 1967 at peek family viewing time. At that time, BBC1 is still in black and white, and the very colourful nature of the film was totally lost. Next day, the press went to town to criticise the film, giving the Beatles their first critical mauling. In hindsight though, Magical Mystery Tour is an entertaining film, and as Paul McCartney rightly pointed out, the only place you can see John Lennon singing I Am The Walrus."
