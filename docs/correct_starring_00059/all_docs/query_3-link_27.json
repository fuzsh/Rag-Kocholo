        "text": "I couldn't have known, as my late husband and I brushed past the figure in the front row of a Hair rehearsal in 1968 at the Cambridge theatre, that the man-imp who gently prodded me would become one of my closest pals. Victor Spinetti soon invited us to his soirees, where his partner, Graham, prepared meatloaf for literary and showbiz friends.\n\nVic cherished friends and family. When Joan Littlewood and I visited him on tour, he gazed adoringly at her with the same look he would turn on his ebullient mum, Lil. However long between meetings or emails (after I introduced him to the internet), he would shed the performer's facade to reveal the real Vic. Or \"The Old Vic\", as he called himself, facing the passing of time with grace and laughter.\n\nOnly those close to him saw the pain, vitriol and vulnerability which informed his comedy. He could be bitter, too. He let me read some of his fiction, laced with the conviction that his sexuality stopped a deeper appreciation of his serious side.\n\nHis precise portrait of Hatch in the 1978 TV adaptation of Edward Bond's The Sea still breaks my heart. The director Jane Howell staged a scene that focused on Hatch cutting cloth while contemplating not only his personal battle with his neighbour, but also how best to retain his dignity in the face of absurdity. Vic projected Hatch's dilemma as he cut â€“ somehow the precision of his action, so simple yet so evocative, contrasted brilliantly with the chaos around him. For all sorts of pragmatic reasons, Hatch can't afford to make a mistake in the cutting. It's funny because Vic makes you know he'd really like to rip the cloth to shreds; and it's tragic because, in the end, he cannot."
