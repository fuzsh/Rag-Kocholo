        "text": "Paul McCartney is among those mourning the death of actor Victor Spinetti, who passed away Tuesday morning at the age of 82 after a bout with cancer. Spinetti starred in three films by the Beatles.\n\nThe singer stated, \"Victor was a fine man, a great pal and a fantastic actor and someone I am proud to have known for many years. His irreverent wit and exuberant personality will remain in my memory forever. I will miss his loyal friendship, as will all the others who were lucky enough to know and love the wonderful Mr. Spinetti.\""
