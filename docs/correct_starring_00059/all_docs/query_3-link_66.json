        "text": "Victor Spinetti, who died on 19 June at the age of 82, was a versatile character actor, but he will be chiefly remembered for his supporting roles in The Beatles’ films, A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and Help! (1965). Like many in his trade, he was a wonderful raconteur, both in one-man shows and at Beatle conventions. His stories were all true, but viewed from his perspective and embellished with frequent retelling.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Victor Spinetti loved The Beatles. “I fucking hate these songs that are full of hate – kill the fag, kill the Jew – and there is none of that in The Beatles’ music,” he told an audience at the Liverpool Convention in 2008. “It is an avalanche of poetry and melody and it is all about love. I once asked John what was his best lyric and he said, ‘That’s easy, Vic, All You Need Is Love.’ Bear that in mind, my darlings. If you love The Beatles, if you love their music, you have to live up to that. It is a great burden to carry but it is a joyous burden.”\n\nVittorio Spinetti was born in Wales on 2 September 1929 to a Welsh mother and an Italian father. His father owned a fish and chip shop but was interned in the Isle of Man in the Second World War. In the 50s, Spinetti became a leading actor in Joan Littlewood’s radical theatre company, which had a hit with Oh What A Lovely War in the West End and on Broadway. “People ask me did I mind being in A Hard Day’s Night when The Beatles weren’t professional actors,” he once told me, “but it didn’t bother me at all. Sometimes Joan would say to someone, ‘You play Victor’s part tonight and he can play yours.’ Nothing bothered me after that.” Another of Spinetti’s West End runs was in Expresso Bongo, later made into a film with Cliff Richard. “That was a musical about how pop stars were made, which was all fakery, and that’s how the business was back then,” he said. “Then The Beatles came along with their Colgate Ring of Truth. It has come back to fakery now with those boy bands and TV talent shows.”\n\nAccording to Spinetti, George Harrison told him that he would have to appear in their films because “my mum fancies you”. This may be an accurate quote but it is hard to see how Mrs Harrison knew about him. He had only played minor roles on TV and was more associated with the West End.\n\nIn A Hard Day’s Night, Spinetti was cast as a camp TV director. “The Beatles didn’t keep to the script and they cut out so many of the outtakes, isn’t that sad? I walked round the set in my furry sweater and I said, ‘You’re late for rehearsals. I’m the director.’ John replied, not in the script, ‘You’re not the director. You’re Victor Spinetti playing the part of the director.’ I said, ‘I am a director, I have an award in my office.’ John said, ‘Office? You haven’t even got a dressing room.’ I hit Ringo’s cymbals and Ringo lent across and said to John, ‘He’s fingering me cymbals.’ John said, ‘He must be a director as all directors are famous cymbal-fingerers.’”\n\nSpinetti got on well with The Beatles, although it is easy to imagine them mocking his over-the top behaviour. They had an evening out with him when Vic’s sister and fiancé came to London. Paul McCartney called him “the man who could make clouds disappear”, a magnificent line he should use in a song.\n\nWhereas A Hard Day’s Night had a gritty, documentary style, Help! resembled pantomime. “That was more like a filmy film,” said Spinetti, “but Dick Lester is a brilliant director and there is wonderful stuff in there. All the producer’s relations wanted autographs and The Beatles were besieged. The producer came on the set with some friends when Ringo was tied to that machine. The producer brought them round and Ringo, with his hands tied to the machine and trousers around his ankles, said, ‘Hello missus, give us a wank, will you?’ They never came round again.”\n\nThere were uncomfortable moments while filming Help! “We were in the Bahamas and we came across what looked like a deserted army hut with a tin roof. All the shutters were closed and John said, ‘Come and have a look at this, Vic.’ Inside were disabled kids and old people who had been locked in that stinking hut. That night at dinner, there was a frightfully grand meal with the Governor and the Minister of Finance. John pointed to the caviar and said, ‘We saw this hospital for sick kids and old people this morning. How do you reckon that with this?’ The Minister of Finance said, ‘I am not paid for doing my work, I do it voluntarily.’ John said, ‘Ah, then you’re doing better than I thought you were doing.’”\n\nVic was glad that The Beatles were so down to earth. “They were such extraordinary people yet such ordinary people too. There was always a still small centre in the midst of all the hysteria. When we were driving to the première of Help!, we got to the London Pavilion Cinema and the kids were all screaming. John said, ‘Push Paul out first, he’s the prettiest.’”\n\nGeorge Harrison tried to interest Vic in Indian music. “He told me, ‘Vic, don’t force yourself to listen to it. Just let it happen to you. Western music is all maths, but Eastern music is all flow and you can jump in and out whenever you want.’ That helped me to understand it. They insisted that I met the Maharishi. I was in New York and he was at the Plaza holding a press conference. He was giggling away with all these cameras in front of him. One woman asked, ‘How do you teach children the principles of transcendental meditation?’ and he said, ‘My dear lady, they invented it.’ I thought, ‘This guy is good.’”\n\nIn 1967 The Beatles had bad reviews and poor audience reaction to the TV film, Magical Mystery Tour. “They wanted me to play the courier but I was in a show in London and couldn’t go on location,” said Vic. “They said, ‘Can you do that thing you did in Oh What A Lovely War, and I had a small role in uniform. It was berated by the press, ‘How dare they think they can direct a movie?’ The critics were wrong. That film was years ahead of its time and if they had been at Cambridge, everybody would have said, ‘What wonderful stuff.’”\n\nIn 1968 Vic was involved in a stage version of John Lennon’s books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard In The Works. “This young girl came to my dressing room and said she had written a play based on John’s book. She had cut out the pages, put them in a different order and pasted them into an exercise book. I said, ‘John has written fantasy and you have to have reality in the middle of all that.’ I went to see Ken Tynan at the National Theatre, he said we must do it. I rang up John and told him they wanted to do a play based on the books. He said, ‘I’ll give you the rights, you do it.’ I insisted we did it together. John said, ‘Hey, Vic, let’s go somewhere warm.’ I thought he meant another room but we ended up in… Marrakech. When we came back with the script, Laurence Olivier [the National’s artistic director] said to me, ‘My dear baby, you will have to direct it as none of us understand it.’”\n\nBut first, Olivier wanted to meet John and Yoko. “Olivier was on the steps of the National Theatre and the car arrived with John and Yoko, all white suits, hair and glasses. Olivier said to me, ‘Which one is which, my dear baby? I cannot tell them apart.’ They had tea in his office and he said, ‘My dear Johnny, if this is made into a film, the Theatre will own 60 per cent of the rights.’ John didn’t move. He said, ‘Don’t you have people that you pay to talk about these kind of things with the people that I pay to talk about these kind of things?’\n\n“Olivier was livid. When they left, he said to me, ‘What a ridiculous pair, and what is this line in the script, I wandered humbly as a sock?’ I said, ‘It is John’s version of I wandered lonely as a cloud.’\n\n“He said, ‘Are you telling me that a Beatle has heard of Wordsworth?’ Oh God, yes. They were long-haired gits to him.”\n\nVic was traumatised by John’s murder in 1980. “His death was terrible, still is. Why did he do it? To get his name in the history books. There has even been a film made about this creep. I think that anyone who assassinates a well-loved figure should from that moment on be known as Mr X.”\n\nRight from the start, Victor Spinetti was prepared to speak at Beatle conventions and from having seen him backstage, I know he loved meeting Beatle fans. “Some ask for advice about being an actor, and I say, ‘Remember The Three Rs: redundancy, rejection and resting. If you can’t handle those, don’t do it.’ You should only do it if you have something to give. If you really want something, give it away. If you want love, give it away. If you want happiness, give it away. That’s what The Beatles did in all their songs. Give it away and it is yours forever.”\n\nVictor Spinetti provided commentary for the DVD The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour Memories, released by Wienerworld on 25 August, £12.99."
