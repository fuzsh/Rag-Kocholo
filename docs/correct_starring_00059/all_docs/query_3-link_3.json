        "text": "Actors and comedians have paid tribute to one of the best loved of their profession, the actor, poet, and peerless raconteur Victor Spinetti, who has died of cancer in a hospice in Monmouth aged 82.\n\nSpinetti appeared in the first Beatles film, A Hard Day's Night, and in all of their subsequent films because they liked him so much. Sir Paul McCartney once described him as \"the man who makes clouds disappear\", and he insisted George Harrison told him: \"You've got to be in all our films … if you're not in them me Mum won't come and see them – because she fancies you.\"\n\nRob Brydon, the actor and television presenter, and fellow Welshman, said Spinetti's death was terribly sad news.\n\n\"One of the funniest raconteurs there's ever been, a lovely man who I was lucky to call a friend,\" he tweeted.\n\nBarbara Windsor, on whose Radio 2 show Clubland Spinetti recently made one of his final show business appearances, visited him at his hospice a few days ago, where he entertained a stream of friends, cracked jokes and insisted on talking of the future.\n\n\"He had Jo Malone candles and sprays in the room – it had to be mandarin. I joked that it smelt like a tart's parlour. We laughed and laughed.\n\n\"We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, 'let's not talk about all that, let's talk about the future'.\n\n\"What he was trying to say was that everything was happy in his room. I was happy to see him. He didn't look ill. He looked great. He was swearing a lot, like that would get rid of the illness, and we just laughed.\"\n\nAnother Welsh actor, Sian Phillips, told BBC Wales he was \"a force of joy and vitality\", adding: \"When one saw him across a crowded room, one couldn't wait to get together with him and have a chat and a catch up.\"\n\nThe actor Britt Ekland tweeted: \"Just heard my wonderful friend, co writer and director Victor Spinetti died. Am devastated to have lost a true acting genius.\"\n\nHis agent, Barry Burnett, said: \"He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end. I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.\"\n\nSpinetti was born in Cwm, in the Welsh valleys, above his family's chip shop, and claimed - though none of his autobiographical stories was entirely trustworthy - that his grandfather had walked from Italy to Wales to find work as a miner."
