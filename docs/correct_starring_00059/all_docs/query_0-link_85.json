        "text": "They don’t make films like this anymore.\n\nActually, I think there was only one time when they could make films like this, and that was 1964, so it was a good job they made it then. And despite all the things that have happened since, such as the passing of 59 years, to date it, A Hard Day’s Night remains remarkably fresh, and alive. Watching it is like slipping into a bubble of preserved time and breathing the air of then, the only problem being the return to 2023 when the recording ends.\n\nWatching the film this morning had its drawbacks. I was watching an upload to YouTube that, in order to evade copyright restrictions, had been ‘modified’ to 0.5x speed. This was not a problem as all I had to do was change settings to play at 2x speed. But the film was cut, a few seconds here, a few seconds there, lines and notes flensed from some, but not all of the song performances. And, most curious of all, the entire mid-film performance of ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ was removed from the soundtrack, leaving the Beatles to perform their running and jumping antics in the park in dead silence. But the song’s reprise in the closing concert session was broadcast loud and clear. Wierd, I say, wierd.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was a cash-in, an exploitation of the group’s fame, a step on the road to becoming ‘all-round entertainers’ who would survive the end of the inevitably ephemeral Merseybeat boom. At least, that was the intent. Messrs Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starkey (Starr) were to be presented as they were, in the midst of their existence, in the midst of being The Beatles. This kind of presentation was chosen, no doubt, to reflect their incredible popularity and to accomodate thair limitations as untrained actors. The beatles would play The Beatles, saying and doing what they said and did anyway. Liverpool playwright Alun Owen was hired to script the film, and provide dialogue that mirrored what the four Moptops would have said anyway. Between the naturalness of what they were asked to say and do, and the internal confidence buoying up their innate Scouse personalities, John, Paul, George and Ringo came over as themselves. It didn’t hurt that they were playing the public personae they portrayed on a daily basis anyway.\n\nAnd they were a bloody sight better than Gerry and The Pacemakers or The Dave Clark Five in their movies.\n\nThe film was directed by Richard Lester, who would go on to direct the band’s less successful sequel, Help! and the theatrical Superman 2. He gets a lot of praise for the innovations he brought to filming in this movie: the pace, the cutting, the hand-held cameras, the movement. Watching in the Twenty-First Century, the whole film feels familiar, yet these were all techniques that 1964 would have found strange and new.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was shot quickly and on a low budget, none of which shows. The Beatles are the centre and they’re supplemented by some very familiar professional figures of the time, such as Norman Rossington and John Junkin, as their managers and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director, but the primary figure is Wilfred Branbell playing Paul’s Irish Grandfather, a ‘mixer’ of the first water. Brambell had ht stardom the year before as Albert Steptoe in Galton and Simpson’s classic Steptoe and Son, an arhetypal ‘dirty old man’, hence the constant, in-joke references to him in the film as being very clean, which would have had contemporary audiences roaring their heads off.\n\nThe film has its serious side, not that it shows it off, satirising the life The Beatles lead, under constant pressure from their fans, unable to be free to just do anything natural or normal, except when they escape. That’s left to be absorbed, silently, subliminally. And there are moments, little throwaways, brief surrealities, that had me laughing uproariously, even as I saw them coming.\n\nBut what of the music? That’s what a Beatles film was going to be about and these were brilliant. The film and the album and the songs written for it represent a turning point for the band. The album would be the first to consist only of band originals, without rock’n’roll and early Motown covers. The Beatles were still the young, unaffected, instant band, producing a stream of instant pop/rock records that had no thought other than fun, excitement, energy and all the myriad angles on love. They’re still naive at heart in their music. But this is the hinge-point. This film captures the Beatles on the point of growing up, still inspired by the rock’n’roll of their youth but beginning to see the potential for bigger and better things. A Hard Day’s Night is the doorway to Revolver and Rubber Soul. Here, they’re still playing, and still captivated by playing, and they can still give ‘She Loves You’ every bit of their force. This is where their eyes start to open, where they start to tell themselves there can – and will – be more than this.\n\nFlaws in the upload or no flaws, this was a glorious way to spend Sunday morning. By now, the film’s almost a social documentary, but if they were all as alive as this, there would be a lot more of them worth absorbing."
