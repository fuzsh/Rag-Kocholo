        "text": "We were very saddened to wake up this morning to learn that Victor Spinetti, co-star in all The Beatles movies, passed away yesterday (6/18) at the age of 82. Victor was known and loved by all Beatles fans, as the Hyper Director in A Hard Day’s Night, the Scientist in Help, and the fast talking Sergeant in Magical Mystery Tour. He wasn’t just an actor in their movies, he became a dear friend of The Beatles and very much a part of their inner circle. Victor was a Special Guest at many FESTS over the years. His energy level and the way he told those Beatles stories was unmatched. He was a born actor and it showed. When we invited him to our first Last Vegas FEST in 2007, he was so excited, he said yes immediately. He also joined us a month later in Chicago and he insisted on traveling from the west coast to Chicago by train so he could enjoy the countryside. The gift of being able to get to know him on a personal level will live with us always, as we are sure all who did get to meet him feel the same way. With all the karma and showmanship that was Victor Spinetti, it figures he would take his final bow on Paul’s 70th birthday. He will be greatly missed."
