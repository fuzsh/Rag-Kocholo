        "text": "Veteran actor Victor Spinetti, died today after a year-long battle against cancer, aged 82.\n\nThe Welsh star appeared in a series of movies as well as on the stage and TV, but for many fans he is still best remembered for his roles in the Beatles’ movies A Hard Day’s Night, Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.\n\nSir Paul McCartney described him as “the man who makes clouds disappear”.\n\nAnd George Harrison told him: “You’ve got to be in all our films... if you’re not my mum won’t come and see them because she fancies you.”\n\nCwm-born Spinetti worked as a waiter and in factories before finding his feet as an actor, landing his role in the first Beatles’ film following his success as an obnoxious drill sergeant in Oh! What a Lovely War.\n\nRecalling their first meeting he said: “I was known to them, but I wasn’t prepared for the fantastic and wonderful reception I got from them.\n\n\"We just talked as if we’d known each other our whole lives.”\n\nSpinetti went on to star in more than 30 films, including The Return of the Pink Panther, Under Milk Wood and The Taming of the Shrew.\n\nBut he continued to show his versatility starring opposite Sid James in the 1960s’ TV comedy Two In Clover and as the Mad Jaffa Cake Eater in a TV ad campaign.\n\nHe also featured in rock star Prince’s Under The Cherry Moon as well as appearing recently in BBC1’s New Tricks.\n\nOne of the last people to visit him at his Monmouth hospice was pal Barbara Windsor.\n\nShe said: “We were very close. He was a magnificent man, a wonderful man who was full of great stories.\n\n“We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, ‘let’s not talk about all that, let’s talk about the future’.”\n\nShe added: “Liz Taylor and Richard Burton wanted him at all their parties.\n\n\"The Beatles also loved him and wouldn’t do a film without him.”"
