His tour and the project continue with Bea Palya now adding her songs to Oran's growing repertoire at the House of Music Hungary. Palya Bea's personal world music – her own compositions inspired by the music of various ancient peoples – meets Etkin's cosmopolitan world music. Prior to the concert, from 17:30, Oran Etkin will give a one-hour interactive talk in English, principally focusing on the musician-community-audience relationship slogan.",

Prior to the concert, from 17:30, Oran Etkin will give a one-hour interactive talk in English, principally focusing on the musician-community-audience relationship slogan.(Included in the ticket for the concert).\n\nOran's band includes three great young Brazilian jazz musicians from São Paulo: Serginho Machado, Vinicius Gomes and Vanessa Ferreira. Machado, drummer-producer-teacher, worked with legendary Brazilian musicians (Milton Nascimento, João Donato) and jazz stars (Kurt Rosenwinkel, Joshua Redman). Ferreira is also a key figure on the local scene as a bassist, besides instrumental/jazz formations, he is a member of the local big band scene and has worked with the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra.The guitarist Gomes explores the intersection of Brazilian music and jazz with his solo albums and collaborations with others. The evening will feature music by legendary Brazilian songwriter-singer Dorival Caymmi, as well as original compositions and music from all over the world, led of course by the fruits of the first collaboration of Open Arms with the Hungarian singer Bea Palya."
