Deep respect and honest personal musical expression are themes that tie together all of the artist’s work in composition, performance, recording, or his educational work.\n\nOran Etkin continues the tradition of music education through a groundbreaking new method of teaching music called Timbalooloo. The popularity of Etkin’s educational method has spread through word-of-mouth and has been endorsed by Harvey Keitel, Naomi Watts, and Edie Falco, all of whom have enrolled their children in the program.\n\nOran Etkin’s music has also been featured on several compilations, including the GRAMMY® Award-winning album All About Bullies, Big And Small, which features two tracks composed and performed by Etkin, GRAMMY®-nominated album, Healthy Food For Thought, and the Parent’s Choice Gold Award winner, Putumayo Kids Jazz Playground."
