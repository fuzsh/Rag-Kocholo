Adrianne Krstansky, the Barbara Sherman ’54 and Malcolm L. Sherman Director of Theater Arts, won the Outstanding Actress/Large Company prize for the Huntington Theatre Company’s “Come Back, Little Sheba” and shared in the Outstanding Ensemble/Midsize, Small or Fringe Theater award for the same production. Krstansky and associate professor of theater arts Marya Lowry shared in the Outstanding Ensemble/Large Theater award that went to the Gloucester Stage Company’s “New Electric Ballroom.” The Outstanding Actor/Small Company prize was won by Brandon Green, MFA’14, for Company One Theatre’s “The Octoroon.” And McCaela Donovan, MFA’11, waltzed away with the Outstanding Actress/Large Company, Musical, award for the Huntington Theatre Company’s “A Little Night Music.”\n\nVogue magazine’s website named “Timekeeper,” the Sarah Sze exhibition at the Rose Art Museum, one of 13 must-see U.S. shows for the fall 2016 arts season. Sze, a sculptor, created two monumental site-specific installations (titled “Timekeeper” and “Blue Wall Moulting”) in the museum’s Lois Foster Wing. According to Vogue, Sze’s “deep, beguiling, intricate — and often humorous — work embodies the overload of information and imagery that bombards all of us every day.”\n\nGuy Raz ’96, host and editorial director of National Public Radio’s “TED Radio Hour,” has launched a new NPR podcast, “How I Built This.” It digs into the back stories of the innovators and entrepreneurs who founded some of the world’s best-known companies and brands, from Spanx, to Clif Bars, to Instagram. Go to apple.co/2ctxjpR to listen to episodes (they may even inspire you to draw up a business plan of your own).\n\nStand-up comedian Josh Gondelman ’07 — who also writes for HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” which won Emmys in 2016 in the Best Variety Talk Series and Best Writing for a Variety Series categories — has released his second comedy album, “Physical Whisper.” The album was recorded in December 2015 at the Davis Square Theatre, in Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\nTwo Brandeis faculty members, Sonia Almeida and Lucy Kim, both painters, were recently awarded the Institute of Contemporary Art’s Foster Prize. Each will present a major work or group of works at the ICA from February to July 2017. Almeida, a lecturer in fine arts, was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and received an MFA from the University of London. Kim, also a lecturer in fine arts, was born in Seoul, South Korea, and received her MFA from Yale. The Foster Award recognizes exceptional Boston-based artists whose work has not yet received wide exposure."
