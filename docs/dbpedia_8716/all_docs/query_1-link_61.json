He has been invited several times to be a guest lecturer at Harvard University. Etkin’s music can be heard on concert stages worldwide and numerous recordings, including a Grammy Award-winning anti-bullying compilation album.\n\nEtkin reimagined how touring could become part of the creative process with his “Gathering Light” project. Flipping the traditional record-then-tour model, he first toured in Indonesia, China, Japan, Israel and West Africa and then let the rhythms and melodies he encountered influence the music he created with his New York-based band of Nasheet Waits, Ben Allison, Lionel Loueke and Curtis Folks.\n\nSince then, Etkin has deepened his concept of gathering light as he tours by taking time off between shows to live with traditional mbira masters in Zimbabwe or building collaborative projects with Roma (Gypsy) musicians in Czech Republic. In April 2020, Etkin launched the “Open Arms” project, a monthly release of singles and music videos recorded and filmed around the world with master musicians in locations such as Rio de Janeiro; Harare, Zimbabwe; Prague; São Paulo; and Paris. He also released a similar project for children, “Finding Friends Far from Home,” filming and recording on location around the world.\n\nADMISSION INFO\n\nTickets start at $25.\n\nLOCATION\n\nMidwest Trust Center at Johnson County Community College\n\n12345 College Blvd, Box 14, Overland Park, KS 66210\n\nAccessibility Information: Currently, no accessibility information is available for this event.\n\nConnect with this Organization: DONATE\n\nFull map and directions\n\nPARKING INFO\n\nFor the best parking, check your tickets for curtain time and arrive 20-25 minutes in advance.\n\nParking at Johnson County Community College is generally free, except for the rare weeknight performance.
