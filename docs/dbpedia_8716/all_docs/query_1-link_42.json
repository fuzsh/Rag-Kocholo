        "text": "This year’s Exit Zero Jazz Festival in Cape May, November 6-8, will feature two acclaimed Israeli Jazz musicians: Oran Etkin and Shai Maestro. Discount tickets to see these and all other performers at the festival—including headliner Wynton Marsalis—are now being sold by the Federation of Atlantic and Cape May Counties, which is sponsoring the Israeli artists’ performances along with Israeli World Music and JazzPhest.\n\nTickets sold by the Federation cost $72 (a “VIP Count’s Pass” – a $100 value) and include entrance to a special meet and greet with the Israeli performers 9:30 p.m. Saturday evening at Cape May’s Convention Hall (714 Beach Avenue). Those purchasing tickets through Federation can also see all other performances and receive a reserved seat for the festival’s headline performance, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with renowned jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, on Saturday, November 7 at either 6 p.m. or 9 p.m.\n\nThe Shai Maestro Trio will perform at Aleathea’s Restaurant (at 7 Ocean Street) on Saturday, November 7, with shows at 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Shai Maestro, a 28-year-old Israeli jazz pianist and composer, is a creator of moods, a shaper of atmospheres and a sculptor of sound. His new recording, Shai Maestro Trio – Untold Stories, represents the best of modern jazz today while also showcasing his trio’s camaraderie.\n\nOran Etkin and his band will perform “What’s New? Reimagining Benny Goodman,” on Sunday, November 8, at 2 p.m., at Cape May’s Congress Hall Ballroom (200 Congress Place). Etkin, an acclaimed clarinetist, bandleader, and composer, moved from Israel to the United States at age four. Surrounded by classical and Israeli music, he eventually discovered jazz and was particularly drawn to Benny Goodman, a musician also raised in a Jewish immigrant home. Like Goodman, Etkin was also heavily influenced by the music of Louis Armstrong. Etkin’s festival performance pays homage to “King of Swing” Benny Goodman, with a new take on Goodman’s classic swing."
