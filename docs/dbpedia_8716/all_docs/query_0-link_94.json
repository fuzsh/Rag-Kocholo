Their collaboration began in 2020 when they discovered their shared curiosity for finding the meeting point between their respective styles. By merging their influences in Irish, Classical, and American folk idioms, Hannah & Grant aim to rework their own traditional music and give it new expression. The duo’s original music tells a story about people, places, experiences, and events, directly paralleling much of the writing from their upbringings in European and North American fiddling.\n\nGrant, a multi-instrumentalist currently living in Ann Arbor, MI, grew up playing within American improvisational idioms (bluegrass, jazz, Texas swing). He uses his experience to write original music that interacts with the diverse group of musicians and backgrounds with whom he collaborates. Hannah, a Classical and Irish fiddle player based in Boston, MA, grew up learning fiddle from her dad Andrew O’Brien. She enjoys connecting her two worlds through composing and arranging new and traditional music that reaches across genres.\n\nWhile the duo feels at home on double fiddle, they also change instrumentation incorporating tenor guitar and nyckelharpa. They have received multiple awards including the 2020 University of Michigan Excel Enterprise Grant, the 2021 Binkow Chamber Music Grant, the 2023 Iguana Fund Grant generously supported by Club Passim, and were participants at the 2023 Honeywell Arts Resonance Week.\n\n$17 advance | $22 day-of\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nView Event →\n\nTrem Das Cores: Music of Brazil\n\nTrem das Cores: The Music of Caetano Veloso\n\nGaia Wilmer Large Ensemble + Jaques Morelenbaum\n\nTrem das Cores is a celebration of Caetano Veloso, Brazilian singer-songwriter, and important figure in Brazilian culture and in Morelenbaum’s and Wilmer’s lives. The idea comes from their love and great pleasure in working together with Caetano’s work while celebrating his 80th birthday and, most of all, honoring him as a composer, beyond his greatness as a singer and a poet – hence the idea of an instrumental journey through his music.\n\nGaia and Jaques worked together for the first time in 2018, in a project paying homage to Egberto Gismonti’s music - also a celebration of his 70th birthday – in a series of concerts in Brazil organized by Gaia, and the recording of “Folia – The Music of Egberto Gismonti”, with Gaia Wilmer Large Ensemble and Jaques as one of the guests. They followed up with a collaborative project paying homage to Caetano, featuring an ensemble of two flutes, clarinet, two saxophones, cello, electric guitar, accordion, bass and drums, and began developing arrangements for songs that were less or more well-known, all written by Caetano Veloso (including some collaborations, such as Terceira Margem do Rio, with Milton Nascimento).\n\nJaques Morelenbaum is a cellist, composer, arranger, and musical producer who has worked with great names of Brazilian music, such as Caetano himself, as well as Tom Jobim, Gilberto Gil and Egberto Gismonti. Morelenbaum has recorded and arranged/produced some of the most important recordings of Brazilian music. He has also been a fundamental part of the Jobim-Morelenbaum quartet and the duo and trio with Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nGaia Wilmer is a saxophonist, composer, arranger, and music producer and has been active both in Brazil and the United States. Wilmer has been carving herself quite a niche in the jazz and Brazilian instrumental music scene and has worked with the likes of Egberto Gismonti, Ra-Kalam Bob Moses, Frank Carlberg, amongst others.\n\nEnsemble Personnel:\n\nMaiara Moraes - flutes\n\nYulia Musayelyan - flutes\n\nOran Etkin - clarinet/bass clarinet\n\nJosué dos Santos - tenor sax/flute\n\nVinicius Gomes - electric guitar\n\nVitor Gonçalves - accordion\n\nEduardo Belo - bass\n\nEduardo Ribeiro - drums\n\nGaia Wilmer - alto sax\n\nJaques Morelenbaum - cello\n\n$20 advance | $25 day-of | $12 Student\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nView Event →\n\nBilly Wylder\n\n“A sense of mystery and majesty.” –No Depression\n\nFrom the front-lines at Standing Rock to the archaic streets of Jerusalem, the Sahel Desert to Carnegie Hall, music has been the source of strength for Billy Wylder. The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at Coachella, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center.\n\nBilly Wylder released their seminal third album, Trying to Get Free (Sand & Gold Records), on August 25, 2023. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert, exploring new musical space akin to Devendra Banhart, Beck, and Tinariwen. Billy Wylder’s new recordings evoke musical evolutions built on grooves informed by ancient African rhythms, art-rock textures, expansive guitars, violins, synths, and drum machines. Salloway’s lyrics flow with inspiration from mythical songwriting hero Leonard Cohen, while threading together more abstract imagery reminiscent of Thom Yorke.\n\n“Songs that sound impossibly up-to-minute while remaining steeped in tradition.” –PopMatters\n\nOn the new record, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most critical questions of our time. What is freedom? Has the American dream died? What is truth and what is truly important to us? The band knows that it takes courage to follow your dreams, to create your own sense of purpose and meaning while living in a society where the media and politics relentlessly project fear, hatred, division, and consumerism. Billy Wylder’s live shows are known for bringing together diverse audiences and building community through uplifting performances, movement, and a sense of universal goodwill. The global band includes musicians from Vermont, Cuba, Peru, and Chicago.\n\nBilly Wylder has toured extensively, performing and collaborating with renowned artists including Jack Johnson, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Bombino, The Low Anthem, and Pete Seeger.\n\nTouring band:\n\nAvi Salloway (vocals, guitar), Rob Flax (violin, synth, vocals), Jennifer Giammanco (bass, vocals), Ricardo Guerra (drums, vocals)\n\n$17 advance | $22 day-of\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nView Event →\n\nOnWeGo (ft. Sara Caswell)\n\nOnWeGo is a collaboration between David Thorne Scott (voice/bass), Mark Shilansky (piano/voice), Sara Caswell (violin), and Eric Byers (guitar/voice) embracing jazz, popular, and world music, with an emphasis on vocal harmony and collective improvisation. Original songs are heard side by side with carefully chosen covers, in arrangements that feature the group members’ virtuoso playing and telepathic interplay.\n\nThe Band:\n\nGrammy® Nominee Sara Caswell “is a brilliant world-class violinist...one of the very best of the present generation of emerging young jazz stars” according to the late David Baker, internationally-renowned jazz educator and Director of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. Rooted in an early exposure to a variety of musical genres, Sara’s technical facility intertwined with her gift for lyricism continue to attract growing attention to her artistry as a jazz soloist, sideman, and teacher. Her artistry and unique sound led international recording artist/violinist Mark O’Connor to write: “Most good violinists will never experience what Sara creates with her instrument. It is beautifully refined emotion that lifts the spirit…Jazz violin needs a universal ambassador...a player who can pick up where the last generation left off. Sara is well on her way to extending that tradition to touch new audiences.”\n\n\"Inventive, modern mainstream jazz pianist” (Jon Garelick, Boston Globe) Mark Shilansky provides melodic improvisation and infectious compositions on his own and to a host of jazz luminaries. Shilansky has six recordings as a bandleader and is featured on over 60 recordings as a keyboardist, vocalist, composer/arranger, or producer, and in performance as band member for such artists as the New York Voices and Luciana Souza. As an artist he embraces the history of the styles in which he works, while seeking connections between them as a way of expressing a personal musical vision, characterized by lush harmonies, the exploration of the line between composition and improvisation, and an ever-present sense of humor.\n\nDavid Thorne Scott is a singer and songwriter who “explores the intersection of Jazz and Americana, city and country, instrumentation and lyrics to create lush compositions and covers that are unifying, and healing, in their beauty.” (Eponymous Review) David has long been known for bringing a modern edge to the classics of the Great American Songbook. Cadence Magazine said \"he phrases like a saxophone player and is as slippery and hip as the young Mel Tormé.\" Herb Wong, one of the west coast's leading jazz experts, wrote “I haven’t been this moved by a performance of ‘For All We Know’ since Carmen McRae.”\n\nEric Byers’ extraordinary proficiency and versatility as a guitarist and composer/arranger have been heard on recordings and in concert halls (including at Berklee College of Music where he serves as a professor of Harmony and Jazz Composition) and clubs around the world, with artists like Dave and Maureen Budway, George Russell, Jr, The Fifth Dimension, Lydia Harrell, No Static (New England’s Premier Steely Dan tribute band), Adrian Sicam, and Andrea Capozzoli.\n\n$17 advance | $22 day-of\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nView Event →\n\nDjango by The Sea Festival 2024\n\n8th Annual Django by The Sea~ Gypsy Jazz Festival!\n\nFRIDAY 10.04.24 @ 7:30PM\n\n- Acoustic Nomads\n\n- Django in Brazil feat.

Kouyate, from the West African country of Mali, and Zango, from the East African country of Mozambique, are leading exponents of their respective principal instruments–balafon and timbila.\n\nBALA-BILA brings together live in concert for the first time these two traditional instruments and these two revered contemporary masters at the height of their careers. This living-room-style concert features Kouyate and Zango as composers and multi-instrumentalists sharing the joy, beauty and complexity of their music but also provides a unique opportunity for the audience to get to know Kouyate and Zango as human beings, artists, ambassadors, and global citizens as they explore their connection to each other, their art, and their cultural patrimony.\n\nBoth the balafon (representing Mali, Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire) and the timbila (Mozambique) are part of the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (tim-bila is plural, and m-bila is singular). Kouyate and Zango are leading exponents of their respective instruments, and known for preserving, advancing and contemporizing their rich musical traditions\n\n. . .\n\nBalla Kouyate is a renowned balafon player and “djeli” who is originally from Mali and currently based in the U.S. Kouyate teaches at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music, has collaborated with artists such as Yo Yo Ma and Andjelique Kidjo, and is recognized by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts as an NEA National Heritage Fellow.\n\nMatchume Zango is a master timbila player, percussionist, composer and producer from Maputo, Mozambique.

Over the last 16 years of creating a buzz at festivals and concert halls across the world, they have truly set the standard for fiddle and cello in traditional music. They continue to thrill audiences internationally with their virtuosic playing, their near-telepathic understanding, and the joyful spontaneity and sheer physical presence of their music.\n\nThis seemingly unlikely pairing of fiddle and cello is the fulfillment of a long-standing musical dream for Fraser. His search eventually led him to find a cellist who could help return the cello to its historical role at the rhythmic heart of Scottish dance music, where it stood for hundreds of years before being relegated to the orchestra. The duo's debut recording, Fire & Grace, won the coveted the Scots Trad Music \"Album of the Year\" award, the Scottish equivalent of a Grammy. Since its release, the two have gone on to record three more critically acclaimed albums that blend a profound understanding of the Scottish tradition with cutting-edge string explorations. In additional to performing, they both have motivated generations of string players through their teaching at fiddle camps across the globe.\n\n\"Fraser, one of the most respected of all exponents of the Scots fiddle, would look long and hard to find a more appropriate cellist as a partner...A positive joy.\" — The Scotsman\n\n$30 advance | $38 day-of\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nView Event →\n\nSan Miguel Fraser\n\nSan Miguel Fraser is a project bringing together Galen Fraser, a Berklee graduate and son of renowned Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser and Maria San Miguel, a native of Castile and graduate of Oviedo Conservatory with deep family roots in the traditions of her homeland.

While she was teaching dance in urban settings, she organically provided her students with dance composition tools with which they explored themselves and their connection to communities.\n\nThe DSJ curriculum is informed by Paulo Freire’s philosophy of education as expressed in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, her studies on dance composition, and her experience as a performer and choreographer in the diaspora.\n\nALL-AGES | ALL-ABILITY LEVELS | MOVEMENT WORKSHOP\n\nFOR TICKETS TO THE PERFORMANCE, VISIT HERE\n\n*This workshop is funded in part by the New England States Touring program of the New England Foundation for the Arts, made possible with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts Regional Touring Program and the six New England state arts agencies.\n\nView Event →\n\nDanza Orgánica\n\nDanza Orgánica\n\nCUERPX\n\nCUERPX focuses on the imprints of colonialism and patriarchy in the body. We are looking at the body as the human body, and also the Earth body. How do we embody liberated realities? How does that look like within the context of colonized bodies?

Through Danza Orgánica, we create the world we want to live in as BIPOC. Our values are rooted in antiracist social justice, and decolonization. We envision a world where all living beings are valued, and Mother Earth is in balance. Our legacy is one of opening doors for others, creating spaces for artistic expression, and leaving a body of work carefully created to shed light upon our human experience, and that of our collaborators.\n\nTaíno Afroborikua and award-winning choreographer Mar Parrilla is the founding artistic director of Danza Orgánica (DO).

The collection of songs developed over the past decade and documented on Man Like Me, is a deeply stirring reflection of Cotton’s own experiences which explores connection, loss, hope and resurrection, punctuated by a voice that is hauntingly evocative yet equally warm and alluring.\n\nRay Rizzo is a musician, writer, singer, recording and performance artist and producer currently in his 14th year of gentrifying the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.

Electronic effects are utilized but no loops. All is live.\n\nWith this singular instrument he improvises and composes unclassifiable music, suspended between traditional music of Sardinia, jazz, baroque, post-folk and pre-everything else. Paolo sold out a concert at Carnegie Hall (New York) as well as two nights at SFJazz in Los Angeles and has collaborated with Pat Metheny - for whom he built a guitar - Fred Frith, Hamid Drake, Louis Sclavis, etc.\n\n“…A sound explorer and artistic orchestrator, Paolo Angeli is known for playing a prepared Sardinian Guitar, a crossbreed instrument provided with additional strings with are bowed or plucked, an added bridge, pedal operated hammers and pick ups.

Featuring Grammy-nominated bassist Shahzad Ismaily and star drummer and bandleader Ches Smith, the trio promises a must-see concert for fans of rock, improv, and rebellion.\n\nOn the band’s 5th studio release, Connection, Marc Ribot’s Ceramic Dog have pushed their long-brewing tension between traditional pop songcraft and avantgarde improvisational music to the breaking point, bridging their customary genre-agnostic approach with elements of glam boogie, minimalist disco, psychedelic boogaloo, garage-punk-against-the-machine agitprop, and so much more.\n\n“Ceramic Dog, a power trio of jazz geniuses who inflect literate rock with formidable chops. The synthesis is frenetic, potent, and at odds with the zeitgeist, even if Ribot’s lyrics decry today’s political oppression: Musically, he rejects both the voguish and the virtuosic in favor of his own whims…His progressive sentiments are welcome, and unfortunately more relevant than ever.”\n\n-Pitchfork 2023\n\nMarc Ribot- guitar/vocals\n\nShahzad Ismaily- bass\n\nChes Smith- drums\n\n$30 advance | $40 day-of\n\n*fees not included ($2 facility fee per ticket + cc processing fees)\n\nI understand that by attending this event I hereby grant The Dance Hall the right and permission to photograph and record me and all other participants and to use these images for promotional purposes.
