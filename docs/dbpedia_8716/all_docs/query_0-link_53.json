        "text": "A look at the 2017 winter edition of the Red Sea Jazz Festival.\n\nBy BARRY DAVIS\n\nRED SEA JAZZ FESTIVAL Eilat February 9-11 What could be better than heading down to Eilat in the winter to soak up some rays, take a dip in the Red Sea and catch some quality jazz, and other, vibes while you’re at it? The 2017 winter edition of the Red Sea Jazz Festival provided an opportunity to catch all of the above, and more. Artistic director Dubi Lenz laid on his usual eclectic offering of shows, ranging from pop-oriented slots, that drew large crowds, to highly entertaining jazzy stuff which, happily, were also well attended. In terms of entertainment mixed with edification, Oran Etkin took the biscuit. The thirty-something Israeli-born American reedman presented his renditions of numbers which were made famous by King of Swing clarinetist and band leader Benny Goodman, mostly back in the 1930s. The concert repertoire was based on Etkin’s What’s New? Reimagining Benny Goodman project, which recently spawned a new CD. Etkin is blessed with excellent interpersonal skills, both with his horns – he played bass clarinet and clarinet – and in plain old words, as he illuminated us with fascinating stories about the early days of jazz. Etkin and his cohorts – pianist Adam Birnbaum, effervescent drummer Matt Wilson and silkily skilled veteran vibraphonist Steve Nelson – proffered Etkin’s personal and contemporary take on Goodman’s material, which was duly lapped up by one and all in the auditorium at both the band’s gigs. Italian trumpeter Luca Aquino provided the most expansive spot over the three days, as he led his trio, of pianist Sade Mangiaracina and dynamic bare-footed accordionist Carmine Ioanna, in a program of soundscape material that darted into numerous genres and textures. Aquino colored his lyrical trumpet and flugelhorn output with fun breathy and whistling asides, and his show left one curious about his other ventures. Bassist Gilad Ephrat has taken part in quite a few jazzy projects over the years, but this time out his intriguing percussionless show featured four string players, who were all at the top of their game. The program meandered through folksy areas, classical music, pop and the odd ethnically-inclined departure. The concert was a tight-knit affair, with the spot-on instrumental presentation complemented by some crowd-pleasing vocals by charismatic violinist Keren Tannenbaum. Tzur’s show left us all hungry for more, much more."
