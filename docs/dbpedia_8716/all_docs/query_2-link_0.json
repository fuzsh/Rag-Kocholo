        "text": "Oran Etkin has been described as “Ebullient” by the New York Times, and voted #1 rising star clarinetist in DownBeat Magazine’s Critic’s Poll. His music can be heard on concert stages worldwide and on numerous recordings, including a Grammy Award Winning compilation. He is on the faculty of The New School University and has also appeared as a guest lecturer at Harvard University. French newspaper Libération chose his Paris concert as one of the top 6 musical events of the year, hailing it as ”a concert of weightlessness, class, spark, inspiration and sharing. Magic uninterrupted... for such is the music of Etkin: sensitive to the exchange with the audience.”\n\nIndeed creating connection is at the core of all of Etkin’s musical endeavors. With his Open Arms Project, Etkin flipped the traditional tape-then-tour model. He took time off during his tours to create new music with traditional mbira musicians in Zimbabwe, Roma musicians in Czech Republic, legendary songwriters in Rio de Janeiro and innovative composers in São Paulo. Now on tour, Etkin’s band deconstructs and recomposes fresh music based on the melodies, rhythms and motifs that he recorded around the world. Incorporating electronics derived from stems of the original recordings, the live show tells a story of an opening and connected world, rooted in its traditions, yet forging a fresh path forward. On the upcoming Open Arms album (Jan 2024 - Ground Up Music), the original collaborations recorded on location are intermingled with these modern electronics-infused compositions that pay homage to the people and places Etkin connected with on his journey.\n\nEtkin feels a strong responsibility to uplift the next generation, passing on the rich musical traditions of this world and instilling a sense of curiosity and openness to other cultures. Etkin's Timbalooloo program has created a paradigm shift in music education, empowering children to express themselves by making instruments come alive and talk with each other. The Timbalooloo educational method has been embraced through partners worldwide ranging from The New School University's Mannes Prep program to UNESCO & Herbie Hancock Institute, to Mladi Ladi Jazz, which has implemented Timbalooloo in public schools throughout Czech Republic with particular outreach to the underserved Roma community (Roma are the people often referred to as Gypsies). It has also been endorsed by celebrity parents including Harvey Keitel, Naomi Watts, Live Schreiber, Martha Stewart, Ken Burns, all of whom enrolled their children or grandchildren. Etkin’s full band live Timbalooloo concerts for children has been embraced by theaters worldwide with performances at North Sea Jazz, Istanbul Jazz Fest, Kennedy Center, Shanghai Theater and more. The latest Timbalooloo album, Finding Friends Far From Home, was recorded in Zimbabwe, Turkey, Czech Republic and China and tells the story of Clara Net (Etkin’s Clarinet) making new instrument friends in each country. Timbalooloo endeavors to nurture a generation of children to become fluent in the international language of music and see beauty and creativity in other cultures.\n\nWhether standing in front of an orchestra or sitting crosslegged on the floor surrounded by a gaggle of children, Etkin’s work is about imagination, expression, playfulness and emotion. It draws its strength from the conviction that the the true power of music lies not just in the individual's pursuit of technical mastery but in the joyful and soulful creation of community!"
