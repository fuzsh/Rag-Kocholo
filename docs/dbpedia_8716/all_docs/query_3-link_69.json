        "text": "Jazz at Lincoln Center’s 30th anniversary celebration continues in Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, with programming honoring the centennials of Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie, two of the seminal figures of jazz. These 100th birthday celebrations feature performances by drummer T.S. Monk, honoring his father with his sextet for two nights, including on Monk’s actual birthdate, October 10; pianist/composer Frank Carlberg with his large ensemble playing new compositions inspired by Monk; and organist/pianist/trumpeter Joey DeFrancesco’s trio for their own unique take on Monk’s music. The Josh Evans Big Band and trumpeter Jon Faddis will lead tributes to Dizzy Gillespie around his birthdate, October 21.\n\nAdditional highlights include: The Georgia Horns, a quintet of artists all born and raised in Georgia, including Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra’s trombonist Chris Crenshaw and trumpeter Marcus Printup, will be making their New York debut performances at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola on October 27-29; and a rare opportunity to see Japanese pianist Makoto Ozone on October 31 in an intimate club setting before he joins the New York Philharmonic later that week.\n\nOCTOBER 2017 DIZZY CLUB COCA-COLA LINEUP:\n\nPAQUITO D’RIVERA ENSEMBLE: THE LATIN JAZZ CHRONICLES\n\nOctober 1 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera, pianist Alex Brown, bassist Oscar Stagnaro, drummer Mark Walker, trumpeter/valve trombonist Diego Urcola, percussionist Arturo Stable\n\n14-time Grammy Award winner Paquito D’Rivera returns to the intimate setting of Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola. Not only is he one of the world’s foremost saxophone and clarinet virtuosos, D’Rivera is also a composer whose contributions to classical music and Latin jazz have earned him both a Carnegie Hall Lifetime Achievement Award and the status of NEA Jazz Master. Though D’Rivera regularly sells out top concert halls in New York City, he knows how to channel his magic into the club setting, working crowds into a frenzy with deceptive ease. Catch him at Dizzy’s before he takes the Rose Theater stage in March 2018!\n\nCover: Sun $40\n\nStudent: $25\n\nJUILLIARD JAZZ ENSEMBLES\n\nOctober 2 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nThe Juilliard School has been a destination for world-class music education since it was founded, and these incredible young musicians will exemplify that legacy in this performance. The Juilliard School Jazz Ensemble features some of the world’s most talented emerging jazz artists, many of whom are already professional musicians. No stranger to Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, the ensemble has also performed at noted venues such as the Blue Note and Alice Tully Hall. These gifted young musicians are proof of jazz’s bright future.\n\nCover: $30\n\nStudents: $15\n\nRODNEY GREEN TRIO\n\nOctober 3 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith pianist Jeb Patton, bassist David Wong, and drummer Rodney Green\n\nDrummer Rodney Green has been touring internationally since he was 17, working with such musicians as Christian McBride, Diana Krall, Eric Reed, Tom Harrell, and Joe Henderson all before the age of 20. Today he continues to be a top sideman as well as a composer and leader of his own groups. He’ll be joined by bassist David Wong (his regular band mate in the Benny Green Trio) and pianist Jeb Patton, the Heath Brothers’ go-to accompanist. Fans of impeccable straight-ahead jazz will not be disappointed.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $25\n\nNICKI PARROTT QUARTET CELEBRATES BLOSSOM DEARIE\n\nArbors Records CD Celebration\n\nOctober 4 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith bassist/vocalist Nicki Parrott, pianist Chris Grasso, vibraphonist Chuck Redd, and drummer Lenny Robinson\n\nAt first, Nicki Parrott was simply an excellent bassist. With the encouragement of Les Paul, whose trio she played in for ten years, she then started to share her vocal talents with the world. Parrott is now a prominent bandleader and in demand as both a bassist and a vocalist; over the past few years, Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola audiences have seen her perform both roles in the bands of living legends like Bucky Pizzarelli and Joe Wilder. She returns with the band that recorded her latest album, Dear Blossom, a heartfelt tribute to iconic pianist and vocalist Blossom Dearie. Both the group and the repertoire generate a classic New York supper club vibe sure to appeal to fans of cabaret and laid-back, swinging jazz.\n\nCover: $30\n\nStudents: $20\n\nTHE BAYLOR PROJECT FEATURING JEAN BAYLOR & MARCUS BAYLOR\n\n“The Journey” Tour\n\nOctober 5 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith vocalist Jean Baylor, drummer Marcus Baylor, pianist Terry Brewer, upright bassist Dezron Douglas, soprano/tenor saxophonist Keith Loftis, and trumpet/flugelhorn player Freddie Hendrix\n\nIn one of the great contemporary musical marriages, vocalist Jean Baylor and drummer Marcus Baylor present a genre-crossing artistry that emphasizes the shared cultural backgrounds of gospel, soul, blues, and jazz. While the pair has deep roots in the church, they also “maintain the secular swing and edge so essential in contemporary jazz” (All About Jazz). As Jean explains, “the church has always been a place where you feel the spirit of music… what you’re hearing in our music is the culmination of history in this country that permeates every area of American culture.” Even when the band’s soloists borrow the spotlight—including Jean, a phenomenal vocal improviser— the Baylors’ soul-stirring music is widely accessible and appealing. This project has sold out shows across the United States and lit up large European festivals, so make sure to catch The Baylors in the intimate Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola.\n\nCover: $40\n\nStudents: $20\n\nTHE BIG BAND SOUND OF RUFUS REID\n\nOctober 6-8 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith winds player Marty Ehrlich; alto saxophonist Mark Gross; saxophonist Scott Robinson; tenor saxophonist Roxy Coss; baritone saxophonist Carl Maraghi; trombonists Marshall Gilkes, Ryan Keberle, Luis Bonilla; bass trombonist Dave Taylor; trumpeters Frank Greene, Tim Hagans, Freddie Hendrix, Ingrid Jensen; pianist Steve Allee; bassist Rufus Reid; drummer Chris Beck; guitarist Vic Juris; and conductor Dennis Mackrel\n\nRufus Reid has long been one of the world’s top bassists. He’s toured and recorded with Stan Getz, Kenny Burrell, Nancy Wilson, Thad Jones and Mel Lewis, Dexter Gordon, Benny Golson, and countless others. These days, Reid is increasingly stepping into the spotlight as a bandleader, and his big band is truly remarkable. His most recent album, featuring almost the exact same lineup as the group at Dizzy’s, received Grammy Award nominations for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album and Best Instrumental Composition. It’s a striking suite of music, fusing swinging jazz and European classical music with a rare level of depth, intensity, and variety. Reid’s grand compositions are the centerpiece of this experience, and the world-class soloists throughout his band help make each piece even more special and unique.\n\nCover: Fri $45/ Sat $45/ Sun $35\n\nStudents: $25\n\nFRANK CARLBERG LARGE ENSEMBLE: MONK DREAMS, HALLUCINATIONS, AND NIGHTMARES*\n\nOctober 9 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith trumpeters and flugelhorn players Jonathan Powell, Kirk Knuffke, John Carlson, Dave Smith; trombonists Alan Ferber, Chris Washburne, Brian Drye, Max Seigel; woodwind players John O’Gallagher, Jeremy Udden, Adam Kolker, Sam Sadigursky, Brian Landrus; vocalist Christine Correa; pianist Frank Carlberg; bassist Johannes Weidenmüller; drummer Michael Sarin; and conductor JC Sanford\n\nMonk Dreams, Hallucinations, and Nightmares is not intended as a Thelonious Monk tribute album, but rather, as composer and pianist Frank Carlberg describes it, as “a celebration of the beauty and vitality of his music.” Carlberg takes a unique approach to engaging with Monk’s iconic music; aside from ‘”Round Midnight,” Carlberg’s pieces are new compositions, not Monk arrangements, and yet Monk’s tunes are directly quoted and paraphrased throughout. This affords listeners an opportunity to enjoy hints and momentary exclamations from the Monk originals they love, while at the same time experiencing something brand new—hence the dreamlike quality for those familiar with Monk’s work. Artists often include such allusions, and even quotations, of masterworks from previous generations in their respective mediums, but it’s rewarding to experience it in such a direct fashion, literally hearing the inspiration and the result as one. This is music “in the orbit of Monk… infected by, informed by, in awe of Monk.”\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nT.S. MONK SEXTET\n\nOctober 10-11 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nOn what would have been Thelonoious Monk’s 100th birthday, we celebrate Monk’s legacy with his son, T.S Monk. Much like his father, drummer T.S. Monk has made invaluable contributions to jazz, including founding the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, which has educated and helped launch the careers of some of our best musicians. T.S. first performed with his father’s group in the early 1970s, but for the last few decades he has been an excellent band leader with a reputation for highlighting obscure compositions deserving of larger audiences. We’re celebrating the Monk centennial all week at Dizzy’s, and there’s no better place to be on his 100th birthday than in the club with his son!\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nJOEY DEFRANCESCO PLAYS MONK\n\nOctober 12-15 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith organist/pianist/trumpeter Joey DeFrancesco, saxophonist Troy Roberts, and drummer Michael Ode\n\n“The modern master of the Hammond B-3 organ.” – NPR\n\nMulti-instrumentalist and singer Joey DeFrancesco was born in 1971, signed his first record deal at age 16, and has since recorded and performed with Miles Davis, Jimmy Smith, Elvin Jones, James Moody, Ray Charles, and countless more. Loved by musicians, critics, and audiences, he has won the DownBeat Critics Poll ten times and has won the Readers Poll every year since 2005! Catch his trio at Dizzy’s for a unique take on the music of Thelonious Monk—part of our weeklong celebration of Monk’s centennial.\n\nCover: Thurs, Fri $40 / Sat $45 / Sun $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nMONDAY NIGHTS WITH WBGO: ALLISON MILLER’S BOOM TIC BOOM\n\nOctober 16 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith violinist Jenny Scheinman, pianist Carmen Staaf, cornetist Kirk Knuffke, clarinetist Jeff Lederer, bassist Todd Sickafoose, and drummer/composer Allison Miller\n\nDrummer, composer, and bandleader Allison Miller returns to Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola with her band Boom Tic Boom. The ensemble traverses an eclectic repertoire of Miller’s original pieces that show off her versatility as a drummer—ranging from hard-driving, rock-influenced drumming to freer, more decorative stretches. Across this range, audiences can expect to hear extended solos from her excellent band members, moments of group improvisation, and a series of rhythmically and melodically complex tunes that are both unpredictable and memorable. Overall, the group’s genre is hard to categorize, and that flexibility works to its benefit, making them one of modern creative music’s most compelling bandleaders.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nLive webcast and artist interview with WBGO host Rhonda Hamilton will begin at 7:15pm EST on jazz.org/live. WBGO is proud to partner once again with Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola on Monday Nights with WBGO. The series features talented new artists as well as groups from some of the area’s great college jazz programs. Each performance is hosted by WBGO announcer Rhonda Hamilton.\n\nJOSH EVANS BIG BAND: TO DIZ WITH LOVE\n\nOctober 17–18 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nTrumpeter Josh Evans has performed and recorded with an extraordinary list of artists, including Jackie McLean, Christian McBride, Cedar Walton, Rashied Ali, and Gregory Porter. Last year, the Josh Evans Big Band gave a riveting performance in honor of Wayne Shorter’s Ertegun Hall of Fame induction. They return to Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola to pay tribute to another titan of jazz: Dizzy Gillespie. Evans’ band features an exciting combination of up-and-coming players and well-established musicians. These performances kick off our six-night celebration of Dizzy Gillespie’s centennial.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nDIZZY AT 100 FEATURING JON FADDIS\n\nOctober 19-22 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith music director and trumpeter Jon Faddis, pianist David Hazeltine, bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa, and drummer Dion Parson\n\nLegendary trumpeter Jon Faddis—protégé of the great Dizzy Gillespie—returns to Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola on what would have been his mentor’s 100th birthday. Known for an extraordinary, virtually unparalleled range, Faddis has complete mastery over the trumpet and is now an icon in his own right. He evokes the voices of Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Roy Eldridge, and, of course, Gillespie, all while remaining true to his own. In celebration of Gillespie’s centennial, Faddis will curate and direct four special evenings at Dizzy’s featuring surprise guest trumpeters.\n\nCover: Thurs $40 / Fri, Sat $45 / Sun $40\n\nStudents: $20\n\nGREG REITAN TRIO*\n\nOctober 23 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith pianist Greg Reitan, bassist Jack Daro, and drummer Dean Koba\n\nYou’ll hear it again and again: the Greg Reitan Trio is “deep, yet accessible;” “within the tradition, yet finding new possibilities.” In a music scene that often struggles to find (or even agree upon) a comfortable balance of tradition and artistic liberty, that elusive balance seems to be a unifying topic in the commentary surrounding Greg Reitan’s trio—a unit that has now worked together for 21 years. Much of the group’s music fits comfortably within the established boundaries of straight-ahead piano jazz, and that actually makes the frequency of this “balance” talking point more significant, as it points to Reitan’s engaging original compositions; smart interpretations of a repertoire including Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett, The Beatles, John Coltrane, Chick Corea, and George Gershwin; and a sensitivity, elegance, group cohesion, and technical excellence reminiscent of the all-time great piano trios. This group has found a distinctive voice within a classic aesthetic that will please both dedicated jazz fans and casual listeners.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nORAN ETKIN’S REIMAGINING BENNY GOODMAN\n\nOctober 24 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith clarinetist/bass clarinetist/saxophonist Oran Etkin, drummer Matt Wilson, and vibraphonist Steve Nelson\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Oran Etkins is known for digging deeply into the sounds of various eras and locations, reimagining them in his own voice. In the 1930s and ‘40s, swing dominated American popular music, and for Reimagining Benny Goodman, Etkin channels the “King of Swing” and celebrates several important musical milestones from Goodman’s career. Alongside two top instrumentalists—vibraphonist Steve Nelson and drummer Matt Wilson—Etkin pays homage to one of the first integrated jazz quartets to tour the country. These sets will be a good time for newcomers and longtime jazz fans alike.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nORAN ETKIN: GATHERING LIGHT\n\nOctober 25 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith clarinetist/bass clarinetist/saxophonist Oran Etkin, bassist Ben Allison, guitarist Gilad Hekselman, and drummer Nasheet Waits\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Oran Etkins is known for digging deeply into the sounds of various eras and locations, reimagining them in his own voice. Influenced by Etkin’s cross-cultural musical collaborations, Gathering Light first came about after Etkin spent two years touring in Indonesia, Japan, China, Israel, Belgium, France, and Germany. The rich material featured in this project is inspired by the spontaneous musical exchanges Etkin experienced as well as traditional melodies and rhythms. For this Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola performance, Etkin brings some of the most distinctive and versatile musicians in contemporary jazz: bassist Ben Allison, guitarist Gilad Hekselman, and drummer Nasheet Waits.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nTHE MIKE LEDONNE TRIO FEATURING RON CARTER\n\nOctober 26 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith pianist Mike LeDonne, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Joe Farnsworth\n\nPianist and organist Mike LeDonne made his recording debut in 1988, and he’s still managed to work with a number of the all-time jazz greats: Benny Goodman, Sonny Rollins, Milt Jackson, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Golson, and more. LeDonne performs around the world as both a sideman and a bandleader. Tonight, he makes his debut as a leader at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola with NEA Jazz Master Ron Carter and the great drummer Joe Farnsworth.\n\nCover: $40\n\nStudents: $25\n\nTHE GEORGIA HORNS FEATURING CHRIS CRENSHAW, MARCUS PRINTUP, STANTAWN KENDRICK, KENNY BANKS, JR., KEVIN SMITH, AND BRANDON MCCRAE*\n\nOctober 27-29 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith trombonist Chris Crenshaw, trumpeter Marcus Printup, tenor saxophonist Stantawn Kendrick, pianist Kenny Banks, Jr., bassist Kevin Smith, and drummer Brandon McCrae\n\nThe Georgia Horns is an enormously talented sextet made up of artists born and raised in Georgia. The group features two members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra—trombonist Chris Crenshaw and trumpeter Marcus Printup—alongside saxophonist Stantawn Kendrick, pianist Kenny Banks, Jr., bassist Kevin Smith, and drummer Brandon McCrae. These guys are a seriously good time when they perform, and this will be their first show ever in New York. Stop by for an evening of bluesy, hard-swinging tunes played by a group of virtuoso soloists.\n\nCover: Fri $45 / Sat $45 / Sun $40\n\nStudents: $20\n\nMANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC JAZZ ORCHESTRA\n\nOctober 30 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nManhattan School of Music’s programs of study for Jazz Arts majors are designed to develop skilled performers, composers, arrangers, and jazz educators in preparation for careers in jazz music. Systematic and rigorous conservatory training, combined with a myriad of performance and networking opportunities in New York City, makes this program one of the richest of its kind for emerging jazz musicians. These talented young musicians prove that the spirit of swing is alive and well, and that the future of jazz is in extremely capable hands.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $20\n\nMAKOTO OZONE TRIO FEATURING JAMES GENUS AND JEFF “TAIN” WATTS\n\nOctober 31 | 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nWith pianist Makoto Ozone, bassist James Genus, and drummer Jeff “Tain” Watts\n\nJapanese pianist Makoto Ozone is a musician recognized by jazz fans around the world. He’s resided in both Japan and the United States, and his diverse groups perform in jazz clubs, concert halls, and festivals on multiple continents. Ozone became a serious jazz professional in 1983—the year he graduated from Berklee College of Music, gave a solo recital at Carnegie Hall, and joined Gary Burton’s quartet, starting a musical relationship that continues to this day. Ozone brings a trio featuring two of the most in-demand and versatile players in jazz. Drummer Jeff “Tain” Watts is a 2017 Guggenheim Fellow, respected bandleader, and long-term sideman with Wynton and Branford Marsalis, amongst many others. Bassist James Genus has played with Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Dave Douglas, Lee Konitz, and Roy Haynes, to name just a few, and he is currently the bassist in the Saturday Night Live Band (you might recognize him as the man sitting on the left, whose laughter is a fairly reliable measure of the host’s performance). Catch Ozone in our intimate venue before he joins the New York Philharmonic for three performances in David Geffen Hall later that week.\n\nCover: $35\n\nStudents: $15\n\n*Denotes artist debut at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola\n\nOCTOBER 2017 LATE-NIGHT SESSIONS LINEUP:\n\nDoors open at 11:15pm every Tuesday through Saturday for the Late Night Sessions featuring some of the most talented up and coming jazz artists, with jam sessions on Thursdays and Saturdays hosted by Julian Lee.\n\nTuesday-Saturday, October 3–7\n\nLATE NIGHT SESSION: Jonathan Michel: Celebrating Billy Paul\n\nTuesday-Saturday, October 10-14\n\nLATE NIGHT SESSION: Emmet Cohen and Antonio Capasso\n\nTuesday-Saturday, October 17–21\n\nLATE NIGHT SESSION: Nate Sparks Big Band(10/17-10/20)\n\nLATE NIGHT DANCE SESSION: Nate Sparks Big Band (10/21)\n\nTuesday-Saturday, October 24–28\n\nLATE NIGHT SESSION: Julius Rodriguez\n\nTuesday-Saturday, October 31–November 4\n\nLATE NIGHT SESSION: Dean Tsur: Tribute to Coleman Hawkins\n\nWHERE:\n\nDizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, 5th floor, Frederick P.
