        "text": "Through a decade of work in the many musical worlds that harmoniously coexist in\n\nNew York, 29 year old Oran Etkin has cultivated a singular voice that brings together\n\nelements of modern jazz with traditional African and Israeli music.\n\nKelenia, his debut recording on Motema Music, features his working\n\ngroup of Malian, Israeli and American musicians, along with guest appearances by\n\nvocalist Abdoulaye Diabate and Grammy Award-winning artists Lionel Loueke, and John\n\nBenitez on a collection of eleven tracks that pay true testament to the essence of\n\n\"kelenia,\" which is the Bambara word for love between people who are different from\n\neach other.\n\nSince first forming Kelenia in 2003, Oran and the band's other original members -\n\nBalla Kouyate (balafon) and Makane Kouyate (calabash and vocals) - have developed an\n\nalmost telepathic connection that transcends nationality and genre to create music\n\nthat is free and spontaneous enough to go into uncharted territories, and at the same\n\ntime speak honestly from the heart. It is particularly apt that their recording debut\n\nwill be released on Motema Music on June 9.\n\n\"Oran is in many ways a quintessential Motema artist... a virtuosic player with\n\nmultiple influences, who is savvy as a band leader, courageous with his compositions\n\nand inspiring in his dedication to bringing a new vision to the art form,\" says\n\nlabel owner Jana Herzen. \"The infectious brew of jazz, Klezmer and traditional\n\nMalian music that Oran cooks up with Kelenia, is illuminating, uplifting, and\n\nincidentally, a whole lot of fun\"\n\nAlthough many jazz musicians incorporate world elements into their music, Oran's\n\napproach has a special power born of his triple-threat fluency in the musical\n\nlanguages of West Africa, Jewish music and jazz. Etkin is highly respected amongst\n\nthe best practitioners of all three genres due to his musical journeys to his native\n\nIsrael, his time spent in Mali, and his years on the highly demanding modern jazz\n\nscene of New York City. Given the rarity of musicians who share this depth of\n\nfluency in jazz and world music, it is no surprise that Oran and Lionel Loueke were\n\ndrawn to each other early on in their professional careers.\n\n\"Lionel and I began playing soon after we moved to New York,\"Oran recalls.\n\n\"It's always fun to play with him, building off each other's melodies and sounds\n\nand letting the music lead us to a different place each time.\"\n\nOran grew up playing jazz, mentored at a young age by the likes of George Garzone,\n\nYusef Lateef and Dave Liebman. He has been working with various West African\n\nmusicians in the US and Africa for over ten years and learned their music the\n\ntraditional way-by listening and playing it with the masters. For his formal\n\ntraining, Oran also studied classical clarinet and composition, an experience that\n\ninspired him to add a string section to one track, the sinuous \"New Dwelling\".\n\n\"I have always loved playing clarinet with strings\", explains Etkin \"On\n\nthis album, I decided to take that sound one step further, adding strings to\n\n'Kelenia.' All that sound of wood vibrating in the room-the violin, cello, bass,\n\nand also the balafon, calabash and bass-clarinet created such a warm and rich sound\n\ntogether.\"\n\nFrom the spirited opener \"Yekeke,\" which sparkles with Balla Kouyate's balafon and\n\nis buoyed by Daibate's soaring vocals, through the impassioned rhythmic title track\n\nand the cleverly Klezmer-tinged interpretation of Ellington's \"It Don't Mean a\n\nThing,\" Kelenia is an adventurous exploration into a uniquely\n\nkaleidoscopic musical landscape.\n\nHaving developed a high level of virtuosity on an instrument that for years has\n\nbeen absent in the modern jazz world, Oran stands out amongst a small handful of\n\nmusicians who are putting the clarinet and bass-clarinet back into the forefront of\n\nmodern improvised music. As such, he has been invited to play alongside some of the\n\nleading musicians in the jazz, African, Haitian, Brazilian, New Orleans and Jewish\n\nmusic scenes. His work with the New York based African all-star group Mandingo\n\nAmbassadors has been covered in the New York Times and on Public Radio\n\nInternational's Afropop Worldwide. In fact, Afropop Worldwide also\n\nshowcased Oran's work with Kelenia twice in the past year, with music from Oran's\n\nupcoming CD being broadcast on over 100 US radio stations and on stations around\n\nthe world even before its release.\n\nAlthough Kelenia represents Oran's debut CD as a leader, he has\n\nrecorded with artists as diverse as Wyclef Jean and Frank London. He has performed\n\nat venues throughout the US, Europe, Africa and the Middle East including Joe's Pub,\n\nBlue Note, the United Nations (for of Kofi Anan, Al Gore and presidents of several\n\nnations), Central Park SummerStage, Miami's American Airlines Arena and Montreal's\n\nFestival International Musique Haitienne. In his travels to Mali, Oran had the\n\nopportunity to play for the Chief of all Griots and sit in with some of the region's\n\nmost respected musicians, including Toumani Diabate, Habib Koite and the Super Rail\n\nBand."
