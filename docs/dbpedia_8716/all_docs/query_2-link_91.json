        "text": "Jose James, 1978\n\nSolidified in most hip-hop and neo-soul circles, Jose James expands his smooth sound on his new album. In celebration of his birth year, James’ project features all original material and meshes the popular sounds of late 70’s funk/disco with his Jazz roots.\n\nKandace Springs, Run Your Race\n\nPaying tribute to the female vocalist she grew up listening to on her last album, Springs’ latest project is yet another deep and personal one, as the album’s title Run Your Race, is an homage to Kandace’s father, track star and musician Kenneth “Scat” Springs.\n\nShabaka, Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace"
