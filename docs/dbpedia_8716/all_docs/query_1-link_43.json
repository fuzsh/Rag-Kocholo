        "text": "NEW YORK, NY – The Jewish Museum will present Oran Etkin and his Timbalooloo band in a special Hanukkah family concert on Sunday, December 25 at 11:30 am. Their performance will be inspired by two Jewish stories of light: the traditional Hanukkah tale and a story of light from the Kabbalah. It tells how a spiritual light that existed before the world’s creation was scattered and needs to brought together to make the world whole. This story of healing the world resonated with Etkin and was the basis of his 2014 album, Gathering Light, which interweaves his own compositions with melodies and rhythms he learned in his musical travels to Asia and Africa. This concert will intermingle Hanukkah songs from Israel and tunes from Indonesia that celebrate the beauty of the Festival of Lights in a fresh way. Etkin will also share tunes from his 2010 album, Wake Up, Clarinet! with its whimsical blend of klezmer, jazz and world music. Etkin's interactive performances effortlessly convey sophisticated concepts in a fun musical language that kids of all ages can understand.\n\nTickets are $16 general; $13 Jewish Museum family level members. This concert is for children ages 3 to 8. Adults are asked to accompany their children. For further information regarding family programs at the Jewish Museum, the public may call 212.423.3337. Tickets can be purchased online at thejewishmuseum.org/families. The Jewish Museum is located at 1109 Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, New York City.\n\nOran Etkin is an internationally acclaimed clarinetist and composer who can be heard on major concert stages throughout the world and on a recent Grammy Award-winning anti-bullying compilation. Yet Etkin feels equally at home sitting on the floor surrounded by a gaggle of spellbound children presenting a riveting story about Tito Puente, Mahalia Jackson or his musical travels in Indonesia. Etkin has hand selected and trained a core group of creative educators who have taught Timbaloolooo classes to over 1,000 young children using his method in schools and homes throughout New York City. Etkin’s album releases Kelenia, Wake Up Clarinet! and Gathering Light have garnered international acclaim and multiple awards, including Best World Album and Best Children’s Album at the Independent Music Awards. Etkin and his band have performed at the Montreal International Jazz Festival and were invited by Herbie Hancock to perform at UNESCO’s International Jazz Day celebration in 2015.\n\nThe Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Education’s school and family programs are supported by endowed funds established by the Bronfman Family, the Muriel and William Rand Fund, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, Rosalie Klein Adolf, the Kekst Family, and Mrs. Ida C. Schwartz in memory of Mr. Bernard S. Schwartz. Family programming is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with Councilmember Daniel R. Garodnick and the City Council.\n\nAbout the Jewish Museum\n\nLocated on Museum Mile at Fifth Avenue and 92nd Street, the Jewish Museum is one of the world's preeminent institutions devoted to exploring art and Jewish culture from ancient to contemporary, offering intellectually engaging, educational, and provocative exhibitions and programs for people of all ages and backgrounds.

Today, the Museum maintains a collection of over 30,000 works of art, artifacts, and broadcast media reflecting global Jewish identity, and presents a diverse schedule of internationally acclaimed temporary exhibitions. Visitors can now also enjoy Russ & Daughters at the Jewish Museum, a kosher sit-down restaurant and take-out appetizing counter on the Museum’s lower level.\n\nThe Jewish Museum is located at 1109 Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, New York City.
