        "text": "The unique sound of Oran Etkin on clarinet and sax is a direct consequence of his exploratory expeditions into various musical traditions. This allows him to direct his music in completely new directions. It’s not for nothing his legendary mentor Yusef Lateef called him a ‘composer of eminent individuality’. The music on Etkin’s latest album, Gathering Light, developed during his various tours with local musicians all over the world. Following these experiences, the Israeli-born musician recorded the pieces in New York, his base. The album is astounding for its many surprises, which clearly demonstrate how much Etkin respects musical traditions. He enjoys sharing his love of music with the little ones, too. Etkin developed the Timbalooloo method, in which he playfully teaches children about music from every corner of the globe."
