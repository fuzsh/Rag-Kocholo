        "text": "Oran Etkin is both an internationally acclaimed jazz and world music artist whose music has is featured on a GRAMMY Award winning album, and also the creator of the groundbreaking Timbalooloo method of enriching the musicality of young children which has been endorsed by Naomi Watts, Liev Schreiber, Harvey Keitel, Ken Burns and Edie Falco (all of whom enrolled their children in Oran Etkin’s Timbalooloo music classes).\n\nDescribed as a “great clarinet player” and “an excellent improviser” by the New York Times’ jazz critic Ben Ratliff, Etkin has performed around the world with musicians ranging from rapper Wyclef Jean to jazz guitarist Mike Stern as well as his own jazz and world music projects. Etkin brings this uniquely diverse perspective to his music for children, which incorporates rhythms and melodies from Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe.\n\nEtkin founded the organization Timbalooloo to develop several applications to his unique approach to music for children: interactive live shows with a full band; CDs; video programing; and a comprehensive music curriculum that has been taught to over 1,000 children in New York, Los Angeles and Paris by certified Timbalooloo teachers.\n\nOran will release Finding Friends Far from Home: A Journey with Clara Net on August 30th. Recorded and filmed on location in Zimbabwe, Turkey, Czech Republic and China with veritable masters of each country’s traditional music, Finding Friends Far from Home is an ambitious audio-visual project born out of Etkin’s belief in creating deep musical connections across cultural boundaries.\n\nVoted #1 Rising Star Clarinetist in Downbeat Critics’ Poll, Etkin has the honor of regularly being invited to perform at major festivals and theaters throughout the world. Over the past two years, he has reimagined what touring can mean – taking time off between shows to live with traditional mbira masters in Zimbabwe and building collaborative projects with Roma (Gypsy) musicians in Czech Republic. With this Timbalooloo project he further redefines the creative process by gathering the fruits of these encounters into one album which tells a tale of friendship and understanding through the eyes of the instruments themselves – via the friendly and childlike main character Clara Net (Etkin’s clarinet).\n\nThe globe-spanning album will be available on Apple Music, Amazon, Spotify and other music sources as well as physical distribution in North America and Europe. Etkin plans a US and Europe tour to celebrate its release, kicking off with an October 5th concert at Symphony Space in NYC before continuing to California, Washington DC, Baltimore, Paris and more.\n\nA new music video and details about the fall tour dates will be announced in August. Visit www.timbalooloo.com or Oran Etkin on Facebook or Instagram for more information and the latest performance news.\n\nEtkin’s music was featured on the 2012 GRAMMY Award Winning benefit album All About Bullies, the 2011 GRAMMY nominated compilation, Healthy Food For Thought, as well as Putumayo Kids’Jazz Playground, winner of the Parents Choice Gold Award. Etkin’s 2010 family CD, Wake Up Clarinet! won awards from Parents Choice, Oppenheim Toy Portfolio, NAPPA, and “Best Children’s Music Album” at the Independent Music Awards. His 2009 release, Kelenia, won the Independent Music Award for “Best World Beat Album” and has been hailed as setting “a new standard for world music in the decade of the 2000’s” by the All Music Guide."
