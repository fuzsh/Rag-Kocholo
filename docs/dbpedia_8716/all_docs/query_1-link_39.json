He has been invited several times to be a guest lecturer at Harvard University. Etkin’s music can be heard on concert stages worldwide and numerous recordings, including a Grammy Award-winning anti-bullying compilation album.\n\nEtkin reimagined how touring could become part of the creative process with his “Gathering Light” project. Flipping the traditional record-then-tour model, he first toured in Indonesia, China, Japan, Israel and West Africa and then let the rhythms and melodies he encountered influence the music he created with his New York-based band of Nasheet Waits, Ben Allison, Lionel Loueke and Curtis Folks."
