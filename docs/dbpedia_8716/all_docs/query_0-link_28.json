        "text": "Oumou Sangare\n\nThe voice of Oumou Sangare is a beacon  incandescent, steadfast and reassuring  throughout “Seya” (World Circuit/Nonesuch), her intensely spirited fifth album. Singing in the Wassoulou style of southern Mali, awake with fluttering digressions, she strikes a tone of moral authority and audacious uplift. Her accompaniment, a small army of musicians marshaled by the arranger-producer Cheikh Tidiane Seck, adds bright bustle without obscuring the purpose of the songs, which revisit poignant themes. “Sounsoumba” and “Wele Wele Wintou” advocate women’s rights and the end of preadolescent forced marriages. Elsewhere Ms. Sangare tackles immigration, encourages societal respect and, with joy and reverence, invokes the names of her musical forebears. Her most personal declarations might also be the most effortlessly scrupulous: when she sings about her own extravagant success, on the title track and a song called “Kounadya,” she’s presenting herself as an approachable ideal, something made possible in this world.\n\nOran Etkin\n\nMali also looms large in the music of Oran Etkin, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist making his debut with “Kelenia” (Motéma). But it comes projected through a notably different lens: Mr. Etkin, now based in Brooklyn, was born and raised in Israel. His version of a Malian jazz hybrid includes traces of Middle Eastern modality as well as ebullient swing rhythm. It doesn’t feel like the work of a dilettante, partly because Mr. Etkin puts such obvious effort into the act of cultural translation. It helps too that two of his regular partners  Balla Kouyaté, a balafon ace, and Makane Kouyate, a percussionist and vocalist (they aren’t related)  hail from Mali, along with one of the album’s guests, the well-known griot Abdoulaye Diabaté. Even on an Africanized version of Duke Ellington’s “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” Mr. Etkin has no trouble keeping his stylistic bearings. (He’ll play Friday at Barbès; barbesbrooklyn.com.)\n\nSunn O)))\n\n“Monoliths & Dimensions” is exactly the right title for the new album from this drone-metal band, released a few weeks ago on Southern Lord. The scale of the album is tectonic, with each of its four movements suggesting a kind of epochal change. When there are lyrics, articulated with guttural care by the Hungarian black-metal vocalist Attila Csihar, they align the subconscious with the cosmic: “Thunderous resonant sounds call from beyond the depths,” goes the first line from “Aghartha.” (Another track includes this romantic couplet: “I got you in my sublimes of dreams/Where asteroids explode.”) But words are secondary for Sunn O))), a k a Greg Anderson on bass and Stephen O’Malley on guitar, who long ago made thunderous resonant sounds their stock in trade. What’s striking about this new release is its wealth of additional textures: woodwinds, brass, strings, male and female choirs. It all concludes with a pastoral solo from the jazz trombonist Julian Priester, who sounds secure in this setting, almost serene.\n\nSteve Lehman\n\nThe tension between structure and spontaneity has long been a core preoccupation for this expressly future-minded alto saxophonist and composer. “Travail, Transformation and Flow” (Pi), due out on Tuesday, takes that tension to heady extremes. Mr. Lehman composed most of the music on the album with clinical attention to frequency and overtone: his harmonies were devised with the help of spectrum analysis and programming software. So in one sense this is computer music, though it’s also the product of a nimbly improvising octet. (On Monday the group will play at Le Poisson Rouge; lepoissonrouge.com.) Some of the album’s eight tracks  notably “Alloy,” the longest and most immediately gripping  summon the ghosts of a knockabout post-bop avant-garde. Others, like “Echoes,” suggest the tolling of temple bells as remixed by a dance-music collagist. And Mr. Lehman closes with a meaningful nod, covering “Living in the World Today” by GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. It’s a perfectly ultramodern gesture, and the swagger fits.\n\nFranz Ferdinand\n\n“Tonight: Franz Ferdinand” (Domino/Epic), released in January, charted a slightly new course for this modish Glaswegian post-punk band: fewer razor’s-edge guitar riffs, more booming bass and bobbing grooves. Produced by a Londoner, Dan Carey, it reflected the influence of dub reggae, though only to a faint degree. So “Blood” (Domino), a collection of Mr. Carey’s dub remixes of the same material, can be seen as the logical extension of an idea. Most of its tracks employ the usual modifications: a distant-sounding vocal mix, a murkier sonic palette, stark differences in color and mood. “Feeling Kind of Anxious,” which is based on “Ulysses,” the lead single from “Tonight,” gets its message across with throbbing electronics and a gradual buildup. “Feel the Pressure” rides the same tempo as “What She Came For,” but with gummier atmosphere. Less fun are the remakes of “Twilight Omens” (too robotic) and “Turn It On” (too smudged). But “Feel the Envy,” with its echo-heavy groove, seriously improves on “Send Him Away.” When Alex Kapranos, the lead singer, materializes to sing his first line  “I can’t seem to feel the envy I should feel”  he sounds credibly numb."
