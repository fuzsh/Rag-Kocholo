        "text": "By Tad Hendrickson/For The Star-Ledger\n\nIt’s generally understood that jazz was born in New Orleans and came of age in New York City. But these days, it is an unfettered art form that can fuse with any number of genres. Think of Stan Getz’s famed mix of jazz, bossa nova and samba, or the Indo-jazz fusion of John McLaughlin’s Remember Shakti. The music of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and John Coltrane is now an international music.\n\nJersey City-based singer Malika Zarra — who was born in the southern Morocco village of Ouled Teima and raised outside Paris after her family emigrated when she was 3 — will perform at Joe’s Pub in New York on Monday, on a bill that will also feature clarinetist Oran Etkin (playing Malian-jazz fusion music) and Congolese percussionist Koko Jones. Zarra and her band will draw upon modern, straight-ahead jazz as well as elements of North African chaâbi and traditional Moroccan styles such as Berber, Gnawa, Issawa and Houara.\n\nA skilled vocalist with a soft speaking voice, Zarra sings in a light mezzo-soprano that moves from French to English to Berber to Arabic to a Moroccan dialect of Arabic, sometime changing languages mid-song.\n\nWhile she didn’t move to the United States until 2004, she had a creative breakthrough during a three-month trip to New York City in 1996, when she met New School jazz department co-founder Arnie Lawrence, who let her sit in with his student band.\n\n“He was the first person who encouraged me to explore more of my Moroccan heritage and to only sing with that ensemble in Arabic and French,” she says. “I was surprised that an American person would be interested (in) knowing more about this culture, while I grew up learning to hide it. It showed me clearly that it’s a big plus for me to have this other background.”\n\nZarra got her first taste of jazz when taking clarinet lessons as a teenager. Her teacher introduced her to Ella Fitzgerald, Thelonious Monk and the rest of the jazz canon.\n\nWithin a few years she switched to singing, performing in local combos. She usually sang the standards in English.\n\nEven though she grew up in a musical household, her parents didn’t understand why she chose to become a musician.\n\n“Because I’m the eldest of five, my mother really counted on me to help out,” she says. “Even though music was important in the home, like it is for immigrants from many countries, it is hard to become a professional musician. In the mind of my parents, it wasn’t work.”\n\nIn April, Zarra released “Berber Taxi,” her second album, on which the singer and various members of her long-running band wrote much of the material. After self-releasing her debut album in 2005, Zarra has seen a slow steady growth to her career. She and her band recently appeared at the prestigious World Festival of Black Arts and Culture in Dakar, Senegal, where heads of state mixed with major African musicians such as Youssou N’Dour and Angelique Kidjo.\n\nWord has also gotten back to Morocco, where she is considered a rising star notable enough that a TV crew was sent to cover her recent album release party at the Jazz Standard in Manhattan.\n\n“People there love music and they love all kinds of music,” Zarra says, speaking of her homeland. “For them it isn’t strange to hear Moroccan music mixed with other styles because it’s really a crossroads between different kinds of culture and music. So what I do isn’t all that mysterious.”\n\nMalika Zarra\n\nWhere: Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette St., New York\n\nWhen: Monday at 9 p.m."
