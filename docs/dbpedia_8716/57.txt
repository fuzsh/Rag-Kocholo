This is a big summer for Oran Etkin '01. Born in Israel, but raised in the U.S., Etkin's debut album, "Kelenia," is receiving accolades from the likes of The New York Times, and All Music even lauded the recording for setting "a new standard for world music in the decade of the 2000s." As Etkin, who plays tenor saxophone, alto clarinet and bass clarinet told BrandeisNOW, his unique voice was developed through a combination of different musical styles that reflect not only what he's learned and listened to, but also where he's been.
