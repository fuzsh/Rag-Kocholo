A fine exponent of clarinet and bass clarinet, Oran Etkin was born in Israel but lives in Brooklyn, NYC. His latest album 'What's New? Reimagining Benny Goodman' on Motema Music pays tribute to the architect of the Swing Era and fellow clarinetist. Etkin has managed to create brilliant contemporary takes on known Goodman favourites framing them for 2015 but clearly respecting the original joy and melody in the music, alongside cleverly written original material. He came into Jazz FM to speak with Chris Philips about the album and his two nights at Pizza Express Jazz Club featuring vocalist Charanee Wade and pianist Helen Sung Monday 30th November and Tuesday 1st December. #bennygoodman #oranetkin #jazz #clarinet
