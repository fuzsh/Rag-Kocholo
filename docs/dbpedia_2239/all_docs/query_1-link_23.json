        "text": "My baby brother was kind, highly intelligent, talented, a skilled football player, and had terrific sense of humour. Childhood trauma and being prescribed opioids for a broken nose when he was barely a teenager, took his once bright future and sent him down a dark and deadly path. He died in the washroom of a homeless shelter on September 28 2023. My heart is shattered and I‚Äôm broken without him. I use all the energy I have left to fight for him, and those who still suffer with addiction. I miss you, ‚Äúbaby brudder.‚Äù\n\nLove,\n\n‚ÄúSisa‚Äù\n\nI lost my youngest son of four children 6/29/2022 from Fentanyl poisoning. He was only 23, just starting his life out! He started using oxycodone two years before his death, he got sober for four months but relapsed. Went on social media and got pills that had fentanyl in them and my son had no idea. My son was a wonderful person he suffered from ADHD, went off his Adderall then started using oxycodone. He loved everyone had such a big heart I miss him every minute of every day üôèüò¢üíï\n\n20 years was not long enough to be your mom. You had the most beautiful soulful eyes that told stories of all you must have already seen before you were even born. You had a curiosity that both made you learn great things but also took your life. You were loving and caring to everyone and everything else but yourself. There will never be a day that I do not miss you and that my heart doesn‚Äôt ache from your loss.\n\nMy youngest Son, very missed by family, Daughters, brother. My heart was torn apart when I got that knock on my door. My strong, crazy, goofy, arrogate boy was gone.We were definitely 2 of a kind. I miss your smart mouth, that sneaky laugh, corny smile. Id give anything just to see and hear it all again.‚ÄôForever missed and Loved Dec.28 2016.\n\nYou were by baby brother. I wish you could have met your niece and nephew that were born. You would have been in love. I wish you didn‚Äôt choose to cope with Taco‚Äôs death in the way that killed him. I ain‚Äôt mad at Cha anymore, nothin but love. Fentanyl is so powerful and the effects are terrifying. I gave my brother 2 Narcan and the emergency staff gave 3 more. He was only in his room for no more than 20 min. Please be safe out there everyone. If you are going to do drugs, educate yourself on harm reduction. The trauma and hurt is something one could never forget. I wish my brother could see me now. Every day I work as a Peer Mentor for people in recovery, and I do it in his honor. ‚ÄúOne Love!‚Äù\n\nCy,\n\nI miss you so very much! You were a wonderful son, brother and father. You helped so many people become sober. You are a kind, good hearted man and an inspiration to others!\n\nI miss you so very much!\n\nMom\n\nThere is not a day that goes by that I do not think of you my beautiful daughter. I miss you so very much, we all do. You were such a shining star with a heart of gold. Your love and desire for your family was immeasurable. Your kiddos are growing up so fast, you would be proud. Amber, you were so much more than the addiction even though it took your life on 08-31-2018. It is the love for you that keeps me going and working to do what I can to help the next person suffering from addiction. I do it to prevent other mothers, families from suffering and most of all to try and save a life. You are always with me my doodlebug. I love you so very much.\n\nMom\n\nRobert, I just want you to know that every day that goes by I miss you more and more. Life isn‚Äôt fair and boy have I learned that. We all miss you like crazy and I know things wouldn‚Äôt be the way that they are now if you were here with us. I could do, baby boy, honor, and keep your name alive. This fight this movement quit because mom is not a quitter. I know you‚Äôre counting on me to save lives and keep your name and your spirit alive forever. I love you, baby boy with every breath that I take. Your brother need you, your sister needs you, we all need you baby. Continue to give us a sign that you‚Äôre still around. As hard as it was to say goodbye, I know one day mom will see you again and I hope that makes you proud. I love you forever forever 29.\n\nForever 19. Life showed us just how cruel it can be on August 13, 2023. Fentanyl doesn‚Äôt discriminate. Takes whoever is in its path out. It‚Äôs not the what ifs that hurt. It‚Äôs the will never that get to me. I love you kid. Wish you were here to accomplish every single we tried to set."
