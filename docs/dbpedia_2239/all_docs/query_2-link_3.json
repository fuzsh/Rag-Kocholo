        "text": "One of the last of a team of wartime British codebreakers who deciphered Hitler's messages at Bletchley Park has died after a short illness.\n\nRaymond \"Jerry\" Roberts, 93, from Liphook in Hampshire, was part of a group that cracked the German high command's secret code.\n\nRoberts joined Bletchley Park as a German linguist and was among four founder members of the Testery section, named after its head Ralph Tester.\n\nTheir target was a system known as Tunny, which carried messages between Hitler and members of his high command, as well as Mussolini. It was less well known than the Enigma code used for standard military communication, partly because it was only declassified in 2002.\n\nRoberts told the BBC he took delight in reading Hitler's messages, sometimes even before the intended recipient.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Bletchley Park Trust said: \"Jerry came to Bletchley Park straight from university, but they were all in uncharted territory. It was new ground for everybody.\"\n\n\"In the last six years of his life he campaigned absolutely tirelessly for awareness of the achievements made at Bletchley Park. During the war, people in one room did not know what people were doing in the next room, never mind another department. It's still a jigsaw puzzle even now.\"\n\nDescribing Roberts as lovely and absolutely charming, she said: \"He was passionate about what he and his colleagues achieved. He did not want to blow his own trumpet but to have the work of his colleagues recognised.\"\n\nThe Tunny traffic was produced by a Lorenz CZ cryptography machine which the Bletchley Park mathematicians were able to replicate without ever seeing it. When German signallers mistakenly sent the same message twice with the same settings, the British team were able to reverse engineer the process and build the machines responsible for the messages.\n\nOnce the system was cracked, the codes were initially broken by hand but later basic computers called Robinsons were used and then the Colossus computer.\n\nThe intelligence gathered at Bletchley Park is credited with shortening the war by two years and helping to save millions of lives.\n\nAfter the war, Roberts became a member of the War Crimes Investigation Unit before pursuing a career in market research.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, he said the information gathered was gold dust, adding that it was \"top level stuff\" referring to the movement of entire armies.\n\n\"We were breaking 90% of the German traffic through '41 to '45. We worked for three years on Tunny material and were breaking – at a conservative estimate – just under 64,000 top-line messages.\"\n\nHe said it was \"an exciting time\" whenever the team \"started getting a break on a message and seeing it through\".\n\nRoberts was awarded the MBE by the Queen and honoured with a postage stamp in 2013 and said the work done at Bletchley Park was unique.\n\n\"It was a war where we knew comprehensively what the other side were doing, and that was thanks to Alan Turing, who basically saved the country by breaking Enigma in 1941,\" he said."
