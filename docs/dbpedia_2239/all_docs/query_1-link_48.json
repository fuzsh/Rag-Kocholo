        "text": "During the life of Coronation Street, there have been a total of 237 deaths, ranging from natural causes to murder, disasters, accidents and suicide. Some deaths are minor characters, or characters that haven't been seen but mentioned by regular characters in the programme that maybe linked, for example, Minnie Caldwell's mother Amy Carlton was mentioned but not seen, and died off-screen in 1962.\n\nMany regular characters are killed off-screen if the actor or actress portraying them have passed away in real life. For example, Bernard Youens, who played the role of Stan Ogden passed away in 1984, and the character was killed off-screen a few months later. Some characters aren't killed off even when the actor dies in real life (it could be some years after they departed). However, some characters are still worded as dead even after the actor who played them has died. For example, Violet Carson who played the famous Ena Sharples passed away in 1983, over three years after she left. The character hasn't been given a funeral on-screen, although references to the character intimate that she has died.\n\nHistorical deaths (eg. deaths of characters' parents which occurred years before the character appeared) are not included, except in cases where the deceased character had appeared in the programme and their cause of death and a rough timeframe are known, such as Elsie Tanner and Bill Gregory.\n\nOn-screen\n\nNo Name Date/Episode Details 1 May Hardman 30th December 1960\n\nInoperable brain tumour - died alone at 13 Coronation Street\n\n2 Martha Longhurst 13th May 1964 Heart attack in the snug of the Rovers Return 3 Robert Maxwell 15th September 1965 Heart attack following a car crash 4 Vera Lomax 16th January 1967 Inoperable brain tumour 5 Harry Hewitt 4th September 1967 Crushed to death when the jack slipped on a van he was repairing 6 Joe Donelli 21st December 1970 Suicide - turned a gun on himself inside 5 Coronation Street 7 Valerie Barlow 27th January 1971 Electrocuted due to a plug not screwed down properly 8 Lynn Johnson 20th January 1975 Battered to death by husband Roy Johnson inside 9 Coronation Street 9 Janet Barlow 21st February 1977 Overdosed on sleeping tablets 10 Ernest Bishop 11th January 1978 Shot by Ed Jackson during a robbery at Baldwin's Casuals 11 Renee Roberts 30th July 1980 Car crash 12 Brian Tilsley 15th February 1989 Fatally stabbed by Darren Whateley outside a nightclub 13 Alan Bradley 8th December 1989 Ran over by tram in Blackpool 14 Ted Sullivan 9th September 1992 Inoperable brain tumour 15 Lisa Duckworth 12th February 1993 Ran over in Coronation Street by John Hargreaves 16 Brendan Scott 20th August 1993 Heart attack in the Corner Shop 17 Samir Rachid 2nd June 1995 Injuries sustained after being struck with a lead pipe by youths at the canalside 18 Joyce Smedley 21st February 1997 Ran over by Tony Horrocks 19 Derek Wilton 7th April 1997 Heart attack following a road rage incident 20 Don Brennan 8th October 1997 Car exploded after crashing into the viaduct at the end of Coronation Street 21 Babs Fanshawe 18th March 1998 Heart attack 22 Anne Malone 9th October 1998 Froze to death inside the freezer unit at Freshco's 23 Des Barnes 18th November 1998 Heart attack caused by head injury 24 Alf Roberts 1st January 1999 Suffered a fatal stroke at Nick Tilsley's 18th birthday party 25 Sidney Templeton 6th August 1999 Natural causes 26 Judy Mallett 26th September 1999 Collapsed from an embolism in the backyard of 9 Coronation Street 27 Simon 25th December 1999 Cardiac arrest 28 Jake Webster 5th June 2000 Group B Streptococcus infection 29 Alison Webster 7th June 2000 Ran into the path of an oncoming lorry 30 Jez Quigley 15th September 2000 Injuries sustained in a beating delivered by Jim McDonald 31 Dean Sykes 12th October 2000 Shot by police markswoman Emma Taylor following the Freshco siege 32 Alma Halliwell 17th June 2001 Cervical cancer - passed away peacefully at 5 Grasmere Drive 33 Edna Miller 19th September 2001 Found lying in Duggie Ferguson's bed at the Rovers Return - cause of death unknown 34 Dennis Stringer 2nd January 2002 Car crash 35 Duggie Ferguson 4th February 2002 Injuries sustained after falling through a bannister at The Ridings property development, and left to die by Richard Hillman 36 Patricia Hillman 20th May 2002 Beaten over the head with a spade by ex-husband Richard Hillman 37 Maxine Peacock 13th January 2003 Bludgeoned to death with a crowbar by Richard Hillman at 4 Coronation Street 38 Richard Hillman 14th March 2003 Drowned when he plunged his car into Weatherfield Canal 39 Billy Platt 2nd June 2004 Complications of premature birth 40 Tommy Harris 4th March 2005 Hit in the head with a wrench by daughter Katy Harris 41 Ray Langton 8th April 2005 Stomach cancer 42 Katy Harris 20th April 2005 Suicide - induced a diabetic coma by not taking medication.
