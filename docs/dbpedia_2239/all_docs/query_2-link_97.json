        "text": "Gerald (Jerry) M. Holmberg Jr, 85, passed away on Wednesday December 30, 2020 in a Hot Springs\n\nNursing home. He was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 28, 1935 to Gerald (Jerry) M. Holmberg Sr and\n\nVictoria Rose (Niedziela) Holmberg. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army Aviation’s\n\n132nd Engineer Aviation Brigade at Wolter’s Air Force Base in Texas. After his service in the military,\n\nJerry returned to Michigan where he fell in love with and married Mary Jean (Keller) Holmberg. They\n\nwere married for 54 years until her death in September of 2014. His employment included working in\n\nhis family’s hardware store in Hamtramck, MI, working at a paper mill in Alpena, MI, and working at the\n\nGeneral Motors Plant in Arlington, TX.\n\nBecause Jerry grew up in Niedziela Hardware Store, he knew a lot about home maintenance and\n\nconstruction. He was able to fix anything. He put his construction knowledge to use by building his\n\nhome in Royal, AR. Jerry loved animals and as a child and young adult, he loved to ride horses. He also\n\nloved dogs raising, training, and breeding German Shepherds, Siberian Huskys, Great Danes, and\n\nMastiffs over the course of his life. In later years he even fostered a dog.\n\nJerry was a loving husband, taking care of his wife Jean for many years before her death. They were\n\nmarried over 54 years. He was a loving son, protective brother to his sisters especially his younger sister\n\nCarolie, a loving and supportive father to his children, and proud “Papa” to his grandchildren and great\n\ngrandchildren. When his son Alan became ill from carbon monoxide poisoning, he took care of Alan and\n\nvisited him every day while Alan was in a nursing home. Jerry was a positive person and even though he\n\nhad many health struggles, he always had a smile on his face despite being in pain. He exercised most of\n\nhis life and he learned to use strengthening exercises and yoga to ease his pain. He did not complain\n\nbut tried to look on the bright side of any situation. He loved talking to people. His conversations and\n\nhis supportive attitude will be missed by his family. His strength and determination were an inspiration\n\nto so many. Jerry will be greatly missed.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, his wife Mary Jean (Keller) Holmberg, his sister Donna\n\n(Holmberg) Niemiec, and his son Alan J. Holmberg. He is survived his sister Carolie (Holmberg) Martin of\n\nSouthgate, MI, his children Cindy (Boyce) Wofford of Alma, AR, Vicki (Kevin) Ferros of Loudon, TN, and\n\nJoe (Andrea) Holmberg of Sapulpa, OK, his grandchildren; Jerry Wofford, Jake (Sarah) Wofford, Austin\n\n(fiancée Christine Scott) Wofford, Zack Wofford, Michael Holmberg, and Brittany Scott plus his great\n\ngrandchildren; Etta, Hudson, Brylee, and Briggs.\n\nDonations in memory of Jerry can be made to the Human Society of the United States at\n\nhumanesociety.orgmemorial-donations or the American Cancer Society at donate3.cancer.org\n\nThe family will have a private memorial service to be scheduled at a later date."
