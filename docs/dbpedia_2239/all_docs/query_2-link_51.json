        "text": "Parker Millsap will play at this Friday’s show at Nightfall, Chattanooga’s longest-running free summer concert series. Local band The Foothills will open the show at 7 p.m., followed by headliner Parker Millsap at 8 p.m. In addition to featuring world class musicians each week, Nightfall features food trucks, local artisan vendors, kids’ activities and more.\n\nReview for the performers:\n\nParker Millsap is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Purcell, Ok. who was nominated as an Americana Music Association’s “Emerging Artist of the Year\" in 2014, along with Hurray For The Riff Raff, St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Valerie June, and Sturgill Simpson. Influenced by the music he learned growing up in the Pentecostal Church and the Blues Radio Times, he also absorbed the honest lyrics of Townes Van Zandt, Mississippi John Hurt’s fingerpicking, and classic albums like Graceland and Rumors. His own musical style represents a blend of blues, country, alt-country/Americana, and folk music.\n\nIn addition to being known for his show-stopping voice, Millsap plays acoustic and slide guitar, piano and harmonica. He remains both poignant and poetic, glorying in careful wordplay and smart, story-centric writing laced with soulful presence, compelling vocals and plenty of acoustic guitars. Still a young artist, he has already released five albums, ranging from the spare acoustic tone of his early-2010s output to the more nuanced structure of 2018’s rock-driven Other Arrangements, the singer and songwriter continued to hone the layers of his sound heading into the next decade. His fifth album, 2021's Be Here Instead, was recorded live in the studio with a full band, and he fused acoustic and electronic instruments for 2023's Wilderness Within You.\n\nOpening for Parker Millsap at 7 p.m. will be the Chattanooga trio, The Foothills. The Foothills blend a diverse range of Americana traditions - folk, country, blues, soul and bluegrass - in an effort to create timeless musical statements that delicately balance artistic integrity and popular appeal. Drawing comparisons to John Prine, Jason Isbell, and the SteelDrivers, The Foothills’ lyrics are painfully honest and often autobiographical. They have released two albums.\n\nFree motorcycle parking will continue to be offered on M.L. King Boulevard between Georgia Avenue and Lindsey Street. Motorcycles must enter the block from Lindsey Street only. A variety of local food trucks will be around the intersection of Georgia and M.L. King, and around 20 local artisans will offer their work for sale in Miller Park. Kids can also enjoy The Chattanooga Football Club’s inflatable soccer field and other children’s activities, including face painting and lawn games.\n\nCome early to Nightfall to take advantage of a new “Nightfall Happy Hour” offering weekly drink specials from 5:30-6:30 p.m.\n\nNo outside food or beverages are allowed to be brought into Nightfall since concession sales are a primary funder of Nightfall (outside alcoholic beverages are prohibited by law at Miller Park/Plaza)."
