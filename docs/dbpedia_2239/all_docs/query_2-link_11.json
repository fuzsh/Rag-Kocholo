        "text": "VIDALIA &8212; Jerry Roberts last action as a school board member was carried out Tuesday night on what became a night of goodbyes &8212; planned and unplanned.\n\nRoberts, who was killed in a plane crash just over a week ago, would have been a returning board member in 2007.\n\nBut three of his colleagues were on their way out &8212; by choice or voter&8217;s choice &8212; and Roberts wanted to honor them, Superintendent Kerry Laster said.\n\nSo in his place, Laster presented Melanie Watson, Jimmy Wilkinson and Lynn White with a plaque and words of gratitude.\n\nBut each board member turned all the words of praise back on Roberts.\n\n&8220;I really admire him and I&8217;m going to miss him,&8221; Watson said through tears. &8220;I worked with Jerry and he was a good person.&8221;\n\nThe awards came minutes after the board voted unanimously to appoint Roberts wife Deanie to fill his seat.\n\nDeanie Roberts submitted a letter to the board saying she would like to assume Jerry&8217;s responsibilities.\n\n&8220;It will be an honor to represent the people in this district who showed so much support for Jerry,&8221; she said in her letter. &8220;I will continue his legacy of placing the children of the school system first.&8221;\n\nThe board also said goodbye to White, the president in recent years.\n\nA new board will convene at the first January meeting, Jan. 11.\n\nA black ribbon adorned Roberts&8217; nameplate at the meeting."
