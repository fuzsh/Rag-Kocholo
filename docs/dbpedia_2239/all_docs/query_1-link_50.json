        "text": "Inmate Jerry Bray (Full Name: Jerry Lee Bray) Died At Texas Department of Criminal Michael Unit In Tennessee Colony\n\nANDERSON COUNTY, TEXAS (January 14, 2024) - A 56-year-old inmate identified as Jerry Bray has tragically died while staying at Texas Department of Criminal Justice Michael Unit In Tennessee Colony.\n\nTDCJ Michael Unit officials are saying that the incident took place around 11:55 a.m. on January 4. Jerry Bray was in handcuffs when the incident began.\n\nIt remains unclear if he was experiencing some type of medical emergency. Jail medical staff began life-saving measures.\n\nBut those efforts were not successful. Jerry Bray was later pronounced dead. A full investigation into the in-custody death remains ongoing at this time.\n\nLiability For TDCJ Michael Unit Inmate Deaths\n\nJails can be truly awful places even in the best of circumstances. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, “In so many communities nationwide, jails act as reception centers for those experiencing poverty, mental health crises, or substance use disorders. [...] even before the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths in jail had reached record high numbers, because they continue to be unregulated, under-resourced places where disadvantaged people are sent to languish.” There are a number of ways that inmates may be mistreated during their stay.\n\nInmates may be subjected to physical abuse, both at the hands of jail officials and other inmates.\n\nInmates can be placed in solitary confinement for extended periods.\n\nInmates are often subjected to inhumane living conditions.\n\nInmates may not get adequate mental healthcare.\n\nDepending on the facts of any case, a jail could be liable if an inmate in their care died. This is particularly true if any in-custody death was due to the excessive force of jail officials. Pursuant to 42 U.S. Code § 1983, every person who, under the color of any statute, ordinance or law, causes a citizen of the United States to be deprived of any rights secured by the Constitution, shall be liable to the injured party in an action at law. Jail officials may have contributed to an inmate’s death in a number of ways.\n\nJail officials may have placed an inmate in a prone position which restricted or limited breathing.\n\nJail officials may not have given an inmate the medication that they required.\n\nJail officials may not have gotten an inmate medical attention in a timely manner.\n\nJail deaths are often highly preventable. They tend to be the result of systemic failures within any jail system. Part of the issue is that many jails are understaffed. Jails have particularly high turnover rates which means that the staff that remain must take on more responsibilities with less training. It is important for inmates and their families to understand their rights. The family of any person that died in an TDCJ Michael Unit jail may be able to seek some measure of justice through a civil claim.\n\nInvestigating TDCJ Michael Unit Inmate Deaths\n\nWe at Scott H. Palmer, P.C. extend our deepest condolences to the family of Jerry Bray. There needs to be a thorough investigation for the sake of the victim’s family. The sheer number of deaths across the TDCJ Michael Unit in recent months remains deeply concerning."
