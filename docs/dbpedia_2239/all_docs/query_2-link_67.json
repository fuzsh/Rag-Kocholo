Actress Jane Seymour presents the documentary, I’LL BE ME, a touching and informative film about Oscar® Nominee, GRAMMY® Lifetime Achievement Award Recipient, and Country Music Hall of Fame member Glen Campbell, and caregiving for his Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\nWelcome by President & CEO Lynda Tanner and introduction by Jane Seymour\n\nPanel Discussion with Kim Campbell, Alzheimer’s Disease Advocate and widow of legendary singer and guitarist Glen Campbell; Dr. Kenneth S. Kosik, Internationally renowned Alzheimer’s Disease Researcher and Principal Investigator of the Kosik Neurobiology Lab at UCSB; Dr. Michael Bordofsky, VNA Health Medical Director and Board-certified physician in Internal Medicine and Hospice and Palliative Medicine; and Jane Seymour, Emmy Award-winning actress, artist, business woman and Executive Producer of I’LL BE ME.\n\n2020 PHENOMENAL RESEARCH ON END-OF-LIFE EXPERIENCES – Dr. Christopher Kerr returns to discuss his latest findings. In his first study, using quantifiable data, Dr. Kerr demonstrated that pre-death dreams and visions are experienced by the majority of dying patients, with positive psychological and spiritual benefits. He will now discuss recent studies which examine how such experiences help the dying grow and adapt as life ends as well as the effect of these experiences on the loved ones left behind. Afterwards, Dr. Michael Kearney, VNA Health Associate Medical Director explores with Dr. Kerr how end-of-life dreams and visions may be a profound source of meaning and comfort for the dying and the bereaved. 2019 VALIDATING DREAMS & VISIONS OF THE DYING with Dr. Christopher Kerr, a neurobiologist and CEO & Chief Medical Officer for the Center for Hospice and Palliative Care in Buffalo, New York. Dreams and visions of the dying have been well documented throughout history and across cultures; and typically, they are perceived to be deathbed delirium, hallucinations, or agitation. Dr. Kerr’s research is the first scientific study aimed to demystify and validate patients’ end-of-life experiences to understand their role in helping patients live well and die well. Join Dr. Michael Kearney, VNHC Associate Medical Director as he explores with Dr. Kerr how these end-of-life dreams and visions are characterized by a consistent sense of realism, and may be a profound source of potential meaning and comfort for the dying and bereaved. 2018 MUSIC IS MEDICINE: COMFORT & RENEWAL AFTER LOSS with a keynote performance by Gary Malkin, a multiple Emmy, Clio, and ASCAP award-winning recipient. Music is the universal language of emotion. Music therapy offers emotional support and provides an outlet for reflection and expression of feelings, ultimately improving one’s quality of life.
