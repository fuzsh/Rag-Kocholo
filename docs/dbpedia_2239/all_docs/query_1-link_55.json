        "text": "NATCHEZ &8212; Efforts are currently underway to organize a flag football tournament to raise money to complete the new Vidalia High School athletic building.\n\nTournament organizer Graham Roberts is leading efforts to raise money for inside amenities in the new athletic building. He said he decided to organize the tournament after his father and former Concordia Parrish school board member Jerry Roberts was tragically killed in a plain crash last week.\n\n&8220;My dad has been trying to get a new athletic building for Vidalia High School for the past four years,&8221; said Roberts.\n\nHe said plans for a new building were approved, but there was only enough money allotted to build the shell of the building. King said prior to his father&8217;s death, they both were discussing ideas on how to raise money for the building, and a flag football tournament was one of their ideas.\n\nRoberts said teams can sign up and donations can be made by contacting him at 601-431-5284 or by email at\n\nstreborg87@yahoo.com\n\n. The cost is $200 per team, and teams will compete in a seven on seven style of play.\n\nRoberts said teams will not be limited in size, and will be divided into men&8217;s, women&8217;s, and 12 years old and under co-ed divisions.\n\n&8220;Flags and footballs will be provided,&8221; said Roberts. &8220;This tournament is for a really good cause. Dad was a big part of Miss-Lou athletics, and this was something he really wanted. People who participate will be making a great contribution.&8221;\n\nRoberts said along with the tournament, T-shirts will also be on sale to raise money for the athletic building as well. He said a late-spring softball tournament is in the preliminary planning stages, and it too will be aimed at raising money for the inside of the building.\n\nThe flag football tournament is scheduled for Jan. 6, and sign-ups will conclude New Year&8217;s Day. Roberts said the date for the tournament could if the weather is a problem or if there is a lack of interest. A location for the flag football tournament has yet to be finalized."
