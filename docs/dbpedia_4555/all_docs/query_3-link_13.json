        "text": "Military Relief Organizations\n\nIf you’re having serious financial problems, your Military Service relief organization can assist. Army Emergency Relief, the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, the Air Force Aid Society, and Coast Guard Mutual Assistance may be able to help with interest-free loans, grants, or a combination of loans and grants. They can also offer financial preparedness counseling and tuition assistance. Visit your Military Service relief organization’s website to learn more about eligibility and how to apply for aid.\n\nArmy Emergency Relief\n\nNavy-Marine Corps Relief Society\n\nAir Force Aid Society\n\nCoast Guard Mutual Assistance\n\nIf your relief organization isn’t nearby, one of the other Military Service relief organizations can help process your request. If no relief organizations are near you, your local Red Cross chapter can process your request. You can also reach out to your installation’s Family Readiness Center for help.\n\nEmergency Family Contact\n\nThe American Red Cross provides emergency contact assistance for members of the military currently serving on active duty by using an online self-service tool. Using a computer, smartphone, or tablet, you can start a request for assistance and track its progress from anywhere in the world.\n\nAmerican Red Cross Emergency Communication Request\n\nTo speak to a Red Cross Emergency Communications Specialist call: 1-877-272-7337.\n\nNational Resource Directory (NRD)\n\nThe NRD is a database of validated resources that supports recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration for Service members, veterans, family members, and caregivers. The NRD is a partnership among the Departments of Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs that connects wounded warriors, Service Members, Veterans, their families, and caregivers to programs and services that support them.\n\nNational Resource Directory\n\nMilitary Survivor Family Support\n\nThe Department of Defense’s Casualty Assistance Program makes sure that military families have support in their time of need, including understanding all benefits and other forms of assistance. Although the term “casualty” is usually associated with death, casualty support to eligible family members also means support after injury and illness, and when a service member is missing.\n\nDoD Casualty Assistance Program Information\n\nThe Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (a non-DOD nonprofit organization) works closely with the Military Service casualty assistance offices to provide additional support to survivor families in need.\n\nTragedy Assistance Program for Survivors\n\nOther Nonprofit Military and Veteran Support Organizations\n\nThere are many nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to Service members, Veterans, and their families, and who advocate for their well-being and readiness. While DOD does not recommend or endorse any specific organization, there are reputable charity evaluation services you may wish to consult when searching for nonprofit organizations according to your specific needs and circumstances.\n\nCharity Navigator\n\nCharity Watch"
