        "text": "Corporal Amayah Littlewolf, U.S. Army National Guard: In the Army National Guard we serve part-time which really helps because I can get my classes done and I can also work when I need to work. I drill one weekend a month and then two weeks in the summer. We have classroom time and then we have times that we're out working on the trucks, making sure that they're good to go, seeing if they need any maintenance done to them. We have to work a lot on the drill weekends but it's fun. It's so cool seeing people in my unit on their civilian side. They have all different jobs, there's police officers, nurses. There's such a variety of different people.\n\nWenona Littlewolf: I'm really happy that she's able to keep the things that she enjoys and especially working towards a degree and then keeping her military side to, going all the same time. It's really awesome that she's able to do well with that. In our spiritual ways, we always talk about living a good life. I think she's done a really good job living that good life.\n\nAmayah: So my major is biochemistry, even though it sounds really specific you can do a lot of things with it. I feel like I would have purpose helping people whether it's on the admin side of healthcare or like actually being a provider, that's what I'm interested in. The whole purpose of being a soldier is to serve your country. Everything you're doing is for your community and for your country so I think they tie hand in hand with helping people.\n\nM1: ​I would say the Navy Reserve is the perfect opportunity for working professionals.\n\n(music)\n\nF1: ​I’m a senior chief information systems technician in the Navy Reserve. On the private sector side, I’m a cybersecurity engineer.\n\nM2:​ I’m an anesthesiologist here at Naval Medical Center San Diego, not only as a member of the United States Navy but as a civilian physician, as well.\n\nM3:​ The Navy Reserve is a tool provided for the Navy to build a flex for needs around the world.\n\nM1:​ If for some reason they need extra personnel in a specific area, they will call upon volunteers.\n\nM3:​ So if we have to suddenly move personnel to one conflict or another, or one manning position for another, they can draw from that like a back bench.\n\nM1:​ When people join as a Reserve service member, they go through the same processes that the active duty would go through.\n\nM3:​ All students and existing professionals currently go through the same program. They get that same camaraderie. They build on that.\n\nM1:​ Once they have completed that, they actually go back to their home of record, and then that’s when their Reserve time starts.\n\nF1:​ I’ve had great opportunities in the Navy Reserve, working from on a ship down to working with special operations commands.\n\nM4:​ Our Reserve unit has a fully qualified beach party team, which means that we can roll and deploy independent of the active duty if called upon.\n\nM3:​ The minimum expectation is one weekend a month and two weeks a year for what’s called an annual training, or AT.\n\nF1:​ The Navy has been fantastic for me, not only from a professional growth and personal growth, but even for me to further my career.\n\nM5:​ There’s no doubt in my mind being in the Navy goes hand in hand with being an American.\n\nF1:​ You get to support your nation by donning on the uniform and becoming that Reserve member.\n\nM2:​ There’s the ability to serve and give back. You know, giving back to the country as a whole, to the people as a whole, you’re doing your piece.\n\n(music)"
