        "text": "Military musicians are enlisted members of their country's armed forces who play in various ensembles and perform duties related to music stewardship. To take the United States Army as an example, each of the five branches—Army, Navy, Air Force Marines, and Coast Guard—has several large concert ensembles that resemble orchestras. These large ensembles might also be broken down into smaller groups spanning a wide stylistic range from Dixieland and Celtic to country, calypso, bluegrass, or Baroque. Although military musicians rarely see active combat, on some occasions they may be deployed to conflict zones—and all are required to complete basic combat training regardless.\n\nFor those who want to work exclusively as a musician and not as a soldier, it's critical that they audition, are accepted for a position, and complete the paperwork before enlisting.\n\nMost military musicians participate in several groups and perform at a host of military functions, including ceremonies, parades, dinner receptions, concerts for troops, and holiday celebrations. In addition to traditional bands, the United States Army also employs a handful of premier bands—elite ensembles that perform at prestigious events such as presidential inaugurations, foreign dignitary visits, and funerals at Arlington Cemetery on top of regularly scheduled concerts and tours. While most military musicians are performers first and foremost, many are assigned additional responsibilities such as working in the music library, maintaining an inventory of instruments, providing sound engineering for shows, or composing new pieces.\n\nCareer Path\n\nMost military musicians are high-level players with experience in concert and/or marching settings. Before joining the army, many military musicians work as orchestra musicians, touring musicians, or general business musicians. Some also possess arranging, composing, or engineering skills.\n\nFor those who want to work exclusively as a musician and not as a soldier, it's critical that they audition, are accepted for a position, and complete the paperwork before enlisting. While some enlist and work for a brief period as military musicians before pursuing careers outside the military, working as a military musician can also constitute a career in and of itself. Military musicians cannot be fired or laid off without serious cause, and members of premier bands are guaranteed the position until retirement, at age 55."
