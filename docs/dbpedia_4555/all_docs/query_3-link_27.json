        "text": "Good morning. So, I'm Master and Rivera. I'm the Senior financial management advisor for 3 26 F . M . S . C. Today, uh is our deployment ceremony. I'm excited to be taking the team forward. We have trained up to this point and I feel confident that we're ready to take over the mission from the 266. I know I will miss my family, but this is something that gives me meaning so they understand that. So they'll be happy to see me when I get back. Hello, My name is Captain Danny . Nam. I just got promoted. I'm just very excited just to get to play with our unit. Very excited for the whole process, thankful for everything that the 3 to 6 has done for me and my family and um yeah , I'm really excited to learn and kind of make the best of the moment that we have and the opportunity that we get Sergeant first class David Ramirez at the 3 26 F . M . S . C . I've been serving as a unit movement officer for the past nine months in preparation for this deployment. This will be my fourth deployment to the centcom A . O . R . I'm really excited about going overseas with this unit for the third time. I'm looking forward to it. I will be leaving behind my wife and my five year old and seven year old who I'm gonna miss but I know I will be able to communicate with them. I'm excited about this opportunity to be overseas and represent my unit and the army.\n\nWe are on a humanitarian mission in Guatemala and we are providing dental services at this site. And we are cleaning teeth, doing extractions and in cases where cavities are really small. We can do silver diamond fluoride which basically helps arrest the cavity. So it doesn't spread. We're making a small event in their population. I wish we could stay longer and do more. It's been at times intense and I say that because there's just such a great need. We really work hard to try to see everybody. I think it's good for the U. S. Military that comes with missions like these because it helps strengthen the relationships and we get to learn a lot about their culture. They get to learn a lot about our culture. So it's really great I am so happy to have this opportunity. When you look at the very essence of why we became providers often times we've done it because we felt like we wanted to contribute to society to help people and when you're in an environment like this, I mean that is exactly what it's all about. Yeah."
