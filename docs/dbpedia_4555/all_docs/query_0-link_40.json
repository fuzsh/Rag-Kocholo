        "text": "As Infantry you will spend your initial years developing your infantry skills within a Rifle Company. You may then have the opportunity of working within a Specialist Infantry Platoon where you will develop some advanced infantry skills such as reconnaissance, sniping, crewing heavy weapons, or advanced communications. Over time you may promote in rank and hold different command positions within an Infantry Battalion. As your career progresses, you will work towards being an Infantry Instructor. In this capacity, you could be posted to the Combat School, based in Linton Military Camp, Palmerston North, tutoring on advanced combat courses, or to Waiouru Military Camp working at either The Army Depot providing initial training to recruits or The Army Command School (ACS) where you would train future leaders during initial training and promotion courses.\n\nUpon successful enlistment into the Army you will be posted to Waiouru Military Camp. Here you will conduct 16 weeks of basic military training to find out if you have what it takes to be in the New Zealand Army. Here you will learn various skills and subjects including:\n\nArmy Customs and Protocol,\n\nPhysical Fitness,\n\nDrill and Parades,\n\nMilitary Field Skills and Weapon Training,\n\nFirst Aid, and\n\nOrganisation and Administration\n\nTowards the end of this course, you will branch into the Infantry, Gunner or Armoured trade, depending on the best match for your skills, personal preference and spaces available\n\nCOMBAT CORPS TRAINING\n\nThis course is more physically and mentally challenging than the recruit course. The aim is to prepare you to operate as an effective member of a rifle section.\n\nYou will be trained in the use of specialist weapons that are capable of engaging a wide range of selective targets. You will hone your fieldcraft and physical fitness and will learn to apply first aid to a combat casualty. Other skills learnt on this course may include working with military armoured vehicles and Air Force helicopters, navigation, operating combat radios, and learning the detailed organisation of an infantry battalion.\n\nAs Infantry, you will be posted to one of the Infantry Rifle Battalions which will either be the 1st Battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) based in Linton Military Camp, Palmerston North. Or you will be posted to 2nd 1st Battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (2/1 RNZIR) which is based in Burnham Military camp, Christchurch."
