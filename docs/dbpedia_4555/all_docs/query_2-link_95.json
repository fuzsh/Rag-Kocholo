Peacekeepers wear their countriesâ€™ uniform and are identified as UN peacekeepers only by a UN blue helmet or beret and a badge. Civilian staff of peace operations are international civil servants, recruited and deployed by the UN Secretariat.\n\nInformation about UN Peacekeeping Missions, including the breakdown of the troop-contributing countries, is available through the UN Peacekeeping website."
