        "text": "To pass the army medical, fitness test and entrance test (âBritish Army Recruit Batteryâ known as BARB).\n\nTo join as a regular soldier you need to be at least 16 years old, although you can start the application process earlier, with your parents' permission. If you're under 18, you'll also need parental consent to join. You should be in Army phase 1 training before your 33rd birthday.Â\n\nYou can apply to become a Reservist soldier when you're 17 years and 9 months - ready to start when you turn 18. You can join until the day before your 50th birthday.\n\nThere are higher age limits for some specialist roles.\n\nThe Army Foundation College (AFC) in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, trains young people to become Junior Soldiers for the various Corps and Regiments of the Army. You could apply for this if you are aged between 16 years and 17 years and 5 months prior to starting training.\n\nYou'll need to be a:\n\nBritish citizen or\n\nBritish subject under the Nationality Act, 1981 or\n\nBritish Protected Persons or\n\nCommonwealth Citizen\n\nIf you're a citizen of a Commonwealth country, you'll need to have lived in the UK for at least five years before you start an application to join the Army. You must not have been out of the UK for a continuous period of more than 180 days (6 months) during this five-year period.\n\nYou'll go through a range of strength and stamina tests, as well as a 1.5-mile run. The standards you need to meet in these tests depend on your choice of unit and job.\n\nIf you have a tattoo that is offensive, obscene or racist it'll prevent you from joining the Army. Small tattoos that aren't offensive in any way aren't normally a problem, depending where they are on your body and how visible they are. Tattoos on your head and face aren't acceptable. If you have a tattoo, the best thing is to go to your nearest Army Careers Centre and ask them to check if it's OK. Some body piercings may also stop you joining. Â\n\nThe Army carries out random, compulsory drugs testing, and if the tests find you have been using drugs, you're highly likely to be discharged."
