        "text": "Even though serving in the Army National Guard is part time, you can still receive a number of great benefits, including a competitive salary, bonuses, and incentives, as well as excellent health care, retirement, and education benefits. Soldiers also qualify for a variety of opportunities, like the GI Bill, to get help paying for their education.\n\nBefore you can become a Soldier, you’ll first need to complete a form of Basic Training—Basic Combat Training for enlisted Soldiers and the Basic Officer Leadership Course for Army Officers, as well as any additional training your job may require. Over the course of your training, you’ll learn the skills, knowledge, and discipline needed to become a Soldier.\n\nThough there’s no way to predict deployment, Army National Guard Soldiers are trained and ready to be called upon by their state governor or the federal government to respond to things like natural disasters or defending the nation, when needed.\n\nDeployment is when Soldiers are sent to a specific location to carry out a mission and are unable to bring their families. The average deployment length is nine months to a combat region and can be longer or shorter for a non-combat region, depending on the mission.\n\nAs part of your service commitment as an Army National Guard Soldier, you are required to spend one weekend a month and two weeks a year in training. Your total service contract length may range from three to six years, depending on your Army National Guard job."
