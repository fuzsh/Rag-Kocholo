        "text": "Guard Tours\n\nSome Army National Guard personnel are on Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) status. This means these soldiers have volunteered to go on active duty providing full-time support to National Guard, Reserve and Active Component organizations for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing or training the Reserve Component. The Reserve Component (RC) has two primary programs, Title 10 and Title 32. Title 10 positions are generally federal level jobs, while Title 32 jobs are at the state level. AGR soldiers serve full-time and enjoy the same benefits and entitlements as Active Component soldier, including paid leave, full educational benefits, medical care for themselves and their immediate family, and the opportunity for immediate retirement after 20 years of Active Federal Service. Title 10 soldiers are stationed worldwide.\n\nThere are also short tour opportunities for soldiers to contribute to their state’s and country’s security while enhancing their own military training and readiness. These fall into three general categories – Active Duty for Operational Support, Reserve Component (ADOS-RC). ADOS-RC tours usually support study groups, training sites and exercises, short-term projects, or administrative or support functions for the reserve component. ADOS-RC is also used in situations where the Active Army has a mission requirement for which no Active Army soldiers with the requisite skills and experience are reasonably available. CO-ADOS is used when the active army (support) mission requirement is the result of a wartime contingency situation.\n\nVolunteering for Operation Enduring Freedom or Other Missions\n\nSoldiers who are interested in volunteering for Operation Enduring Freedom or other missions should visit Guard Knowledge Online for information about what you need to do and who you need to contact. It also provides a way of informing the Deployments Cell at National Guard Bureau who you are and what your qualifications are (MOS, etc.)"
