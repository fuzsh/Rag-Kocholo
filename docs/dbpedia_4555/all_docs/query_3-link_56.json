Employees on military leave receive civilian and military pay.\n\nMilitary Leave Policy\n\nEmployees required for emergency duty (for law enforcement or the protection of life and property) as ordered by the president or a state governor, or in support of contingency operations as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(A)(13), receive the following military leave benefits:\n\nCareer Opportunities through Operation Warfighter\n\nWe are a proud participant of Operation Warfighter.
