        "text": "MASTER SERGEANT AUDREY TURNER:​ Hi! How did everything go?\n\nF: ​Great.\n\nAT:​ Good, good, have a seat, have a seat. Congratulations, you’ve passed. Makes you eligible for that next step.\n\nAT:​ So when you come up to MEPS, liaisons will look at three main factors to determining what an applicant may qualify for. We’re gonna look at your physical that you’ve done at MEPS. We’re gonna look at your background information. And we’re gonna look at your ASVAB scores. That test is actually small different tests all combined to make your ASVAB score.\n\nLIEUTNANT COMMANDER EMMANUEL MAMARIL:​ That test score could then help determine what job opportunities are available for the applicants. Service liaisons that serve at the MEPS assist the applicants with job negotiation and identifying what it is that the applicant would like to do.\n\nCAMERON MASTERSON:​ I learned about being an aviation mechanic through MEPS. When I came here, they gave me a list of jobs. They said I could either be a diesel mechanic, or an aviation mechanic. I’ve wanted to do this, cause I’ve been doing mechanics with my grandfather since I was like five. It’s just something I wanted to do to make him proud.\n\nEM:​ If an applicant has a job that they’re interested in that’s in the civilian world, most likely there is a parallel or equivalent job in the United States Military.\n\nAT:​ Cause we want to make sure that we can find a job for you that you’re gonna be happy and satisfied doing. But overall, we want to make sure our applicant feels confident when they leave MEPS. We’re there to celebrate and cheer with you on your success after graduating basic training and all the other things you do along your way."
