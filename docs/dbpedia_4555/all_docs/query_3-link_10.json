        "text": "Troop Program Units (TPUs) are the heart and soul of America's Army Reserve!\n\nArmy Reserve Soldiers are assigned to reserve units that train together and mobilize in support of America's Army.\n\nUnlike active duty, Army Reserve Soldiers serve part time, allowing them to earn an extra paycheck, go to school, or work a civilian job while still maintaining many of the benefits of military service.\n\nThese men and women typically train on selected weekends and perform annual training which typically is two weeks long.\n\nYou will spend one weekend a month on duty and two weeks a year in training.\n\nSoldiers in the Army Reserve may be called to active duty to provide their expertise.\n\nYour total service length in the Army Reserve may range from three to six years, depending on your Army Reserve job.\n\nIf you’re currently an Active Duty Soldier, call 1-800-325-4389 or click HERE to email a recruiter.\n\nIf you’re already an Army Reserve Soldier, click HERE for more information.\n\nIf you’ve never served in the Armed Forces, call 1-800-555-ARMY (2769) or click HERE to email your recruiter.\n\nIf you’re in the National Guard and want to join, click HERE for more information."
