The CDCR PFT waiver is solely for the hiring process and does not apply to the Basic Correctional Officer Academy (BCOA).\n\nTo be eligible for the PFT waiver, the date of the applicant’s military physical fitness status must have been achieved within 12 months of the applicant’s CDCR Correctional Officer written exam. Applicants must provide the following required documentation, prior to their scheduled PFT date:\n\nApplicant’s military physical fitness examination scorecard (e.g., form DA705) or a reasonable facsimile thereof.\n\nSigned memorandum from the applicant’s commander certifying the applicant has met the physical fitness standards of their respective branch of the military.\n\nFor questions about the PFT waiver and how to submit, please contact your assigned Testing Center:\n\nNorthern Testing Email\n\nCentral Testing Email\n\nSouthern Testing Email\n\nApplicants will be notified whether their PFT waiver request has been approved. Those with approved PFT waivers will be instructed not to appear for the CDCR PFT.\n\nApplicants who are not eligible for the waiver will be scheduled for the CDCR PFT and must pass to continue through the process. Applicants who are unsuccessful in the PFT and wish to pursue the peace officer classification again will be required to reapply when eligible and submit a new application."
