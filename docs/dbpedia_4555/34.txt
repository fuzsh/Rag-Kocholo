As an active-duty Soldier, you’ll serve in the Army full time for the duration of your service commitment. Active-duty service terms typically last two to six years, but your service length may vary depending on a number of factors, such as your Army job or decision to reenlist. If you choose to reenlist, you’ll have the opportunity to be promoted, earn retention bonuses, take on special assignments, and more.

Before you can become a Soldier, you’ll first need to complete a form of initial training—Basic Combat Training for enlisted Soldiers and the Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) for Army Officers, as well as any additional training your job may require. Over the course of your training, you’ll learn the skills, knowledge, and discipline needed to become a Soldier. Active-Duty Soldiers and Officers also have ongoing training to keep their skills sharp, so they stay ready for anything.

While there’s no way to predict whether or not you will be deployed in your Army career, it is possible. You could be deployed at any time for a variety of reasons, such as your Army unit and skill sets.

Deployment is when Soldiers are sent to a specific location to carry out a mission and are unable to bring their families. The average deployment length is nine months to a combat region and can be longer or shorter for a non-combat region, depending on the mission.
