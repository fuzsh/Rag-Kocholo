Although we do our best to anticipate and minimize danger, there’s a risk that comes with being a Soldier in the Army when deployments involve dangerous situations. That’s why we have dedicated counseling and support, along with federal Veteran Affairs (VA) programs, designed to sustain your mental health while serving in the Army, after your service ends, and for the rest of your life.

There’s no way to predict if or how often you’ll be deployed in your Army career. You could be deployed at any time for a variety of reasons based on your Army unit’s skill sets.

Rest and recuperation, or R&R, may be authorized while you’re deployed. The Army also aims to balance a Soldier’s time deployed to their time at home, which is called Dwell Time.

Your unit commander will notify you if your unit has been selected to mobilize for deployment. Though sometimes unpredictable, commanders aim to give units as much notice as possible. You’ll get a checklist of everything you need to do to prepare, like putting your rent on hold or managing your finances.

Most units typically deploy at the same time with the exception of what’s called a rear detachment, or a portion of the unit that remains behind to fulfill other duties. However, there are some circumstances where you can be chosen to support special missions or volunteer for unique training opportunities.
