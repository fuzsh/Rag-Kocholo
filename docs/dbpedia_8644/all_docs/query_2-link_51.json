        "text": "2023 Rawlings Gold Glove Award® Finalists Announced\n\nESPN to broadcast exclusive show unveiling Gold Glove winners Sunday, Nov. 5\n\nST. LOUIS, MO – Oct. 18, 2023 – Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc., announced the finalists for the 2023 Rawlings Gold Glove Award®, honoring the best individual fielding performances at each position in the American League® and National League®. The winners will be unveiled during a one-hour, special-edition “Baseball Tonight” broadcast on ESPN Sunday, Nov. 5, 2023, at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWhile the award originated in 1957, Rawlings first began highlighting the top-three defenders at each position as finalists in 2011. This season, the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays lead the AL with five finalists each, and the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies top the NL with four finalists each.\n\n“There has been no shortage of incredible displays of defense this season, and the 2023 Rawlings Gold Glove Award finalists truly represent the best of the best when it comes to superior fielding ability,” said Mike Thompson, chief marketing officer of Rawlings. “This year’s finalists are comprised of a great mix of established veterans and talented newcomers which should make for an exciting debate around defense as the winners are announced.”\n\nTo determine the winners of the 18 defensive position Awards, each team’s manager and up to six coaches on his staff vote from a pool of qualified players in their League and cannot vote for players from their own team. In 2013, Rawlings added the SABR Defensive Index™ (SDI) to the Rawlings Gold Glove Award selection process, which comprises approximately 25 percent of the overall selection total, with the managers’ and coaches’ votes continuing to carry the majority.\n\nTo identify the utility Award winners, Rawlings collaborated with SABR to create a specialized defensive formula separate from the traditional selection process for the Rawlings Gold Glove Award position winners. Utilizing the SABR formula and additional defensive statistics, Rawlings will select one utility winner from each League.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nP\n\nJosé Berríos (Toronto Blue Jays)\n\nPablo López (Minnesota Twins)\n\nSonny Gray (Minnesota Twins)\n\nC\n\nAdley Rutschman (Baltimore Orioles)\n\nJonah Heim (Texas Rangers)\n\nAlejandro Kirk (Toronto Blue Jays)\n\n1B\n\nAnthony Rizzo (New York Yankees)\n\nNathaniel Lowe (Texas Rangers)\n\nRyan Mountcastle (Baltimore Orioles)\n\n2B\n\nMauricio Dubón (Houston Astros)\n\nMarcus Semien (Texas Rangers)\n\nAndres Gimenez (Cleveland Guardians)\n\n3B\n\nMatt Chapman (Toronto Blue Jays)\n\nJosé Ramírez (Cleveland Guardians)\n\nAlex Bregman (Houston Astros)\n\nSS\n\nAnthony Volpe (New York Yankees)\n\nCorey Seager (Texas Rangers)\n\nCarlos Correa (Minnesota Twins)\n\nLF\n\nAustin Hays (Baltimore Orioles)\n\nDaulton Varsho (Toronto Blue Jays)\n\nSteven Kwan (Cleveland Guardians)\n\nCF\n\nJulio Rodríguez (Seattle Mariners)\n\nKevin Kiermaier (Toronto Blue Jays)\n\nLuis Robert Jr. (Chicago White Sox)\n\nRF\n\nKyle Tucker (Houston Astros)\n\nAdolis García (Texas Rangers)\n\nAlex Verdugo (Boston Red Sox)\n\nUtility\n\nMauricio Dubón (Houston Astros)\n\nZach McKinstry (Detroit Tigers)\n\nTaylor Walls (Tampa Bay Rays)\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE\n\nP\n\nJesús Luzardo (Miami Marlins)\n\nZack Wheeler (Philadelphia Phillies)\n\nTaijuan Walker (Philadelphia Phillies)\n\nC\n\nPatrick Bailey (San Francisco Giants)\n\nGabriel Moreno (Arizona Diamondbacks)\n\nJ.T.

A combination of the national fan vote and the SDI will determine who takes home the honor.\n\nVoting for the Rawlings Platinum Glove Award presented by SABR will begin online at www.Rawlings.com on Sunday, Nov. 5, at 8:30 p.m. ET and will remain open until Thursday, Nov. 9, at 11:59 p.m. ET.
