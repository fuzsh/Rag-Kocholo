        "text": "RESEARCH\n\nDr. Rawlings’ primary research interests include dysregulated lymphoid development and signaling leading to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and/or lymphoid malignancies, and the development of gene therapy for immune diseases. His laboratory uses expertise in basic and clinical immunology, signal transduction and developmental biology to understand how altered signals can lead to immunologic disease, with the goal of developing translational therapies that specifically modulate key pathways. Dr. Rawlings is a member of multiple regional and national organizations, participates in various NIH study sections, and ad hoc reviewer for international grant programs and immunology journals. He also directs the Seattle Children’s Program for Cell and Gene Therapy, focused on clinical application of both viral gene therapy and designer nuclease-mediated gene editing in hematopoietic cells for treatment of immune diseases.\n\nCurrent work in the Rawlings laboratory is focused in 3 major areas:\n\nLymphocyte signal transduction. B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement generates a multi-component complex of signaling effectors, or “signalosome”, that simultaneously trigger both positive and negative signals. The response to receptor engagement depends on the convergence of these signals. Two critical signals regulated by this “signalosome” include: a.) the sustained intracellular calcium signal; and b.) activation of NFκB-mediated survival signals. Our work has focused on the biochemical events regulating these signals. Our current studies include biochemical analysis of tyrosine kinases, adapter proteins, and lipid enzymes; and use of various animal models to evaluate the developmental consequences of altered expression of these proteins.\n\nGene Therapy for primary immunodeficiency disorders. The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in linking deficient function of signaling effectors with specific primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD). The non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Btk, is mutated in the primary B lineage immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA in humans and in X-linked immunodeficiency, XID in mice). Similarly, mutation of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) leads to a multilineage immunodeficiency in humans and mice. Because of the selective advantage for gene corrected cells, these disorders represent excellent targets for stem cell-based gene therapy. We have developed lineage specific viral systems for use in hematopoietic stem cells. We are also evaluating the capacity of Homing endonucleases (HEs) to facilitate genetic repair of mutant loci in animal models of immunodeficiency. Our ongoing includes analysis of reconstitution function in mutant mice, and human multipotent stem cells in vitro and in vivo. The laboratory is strongly committed to moving from preclinical studies into translational trials of clinical gene therapy for patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders.\n\nModeling normal and altered lymphopoiesis. We utilize unique (human and murine) in vitro B lineage culture models and murine knock-in /knock out models to study the signals that regulate B lymphopoiesis, B cell activation and B lineage Function in autoimmunity and malignancies. Current studies include analysis of Toll like receptor, Notch, and BAFF-receptor signaling cascades in the generation of peripheral B cell subsets and B cell tolerance; and analysis of the PKCβ/NFκB/PKD pathways in the development or progression of lymphoma.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nSee Complete List of Published Work in My Bibliography"
