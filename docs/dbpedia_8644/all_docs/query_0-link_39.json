        "text": "Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\n\nNew Album ‘Woodland’\n\nOut August 23, 2024\n\nGillian Welch and David Rawlings have announced the release of their tenth studio album Woodland via their own Acony Records label on August 23.\n\nThe new ten-song collection mingles full-band tracks with intricate duet performances all tied together with the duo’s signature sound and lyricism. Woodland was named for, and recorded at, Welch and Rawlings’ own Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n“Woodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last twenty some years. The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.”\n\n– Welch and Rawlings\n\nWoodland is the iconic pair’s first album since 2020’s All the Good Times, which was a collection of covers and classic folk songs that earned the duo the 2021 Grammy for Best Folk Album, and their first album of new original music since 2017’s Poor David’s Almanack.\n\nWelch and Rawlings also have shared the first track off Woodland – “Empty Trainload Of Sky”:\n\nWoodland Track Listing\n\nEmpty Trainload Of Sky\n\nWhat We Had\n\nLawman\n\nThe Bells And The Birds\n\nNorth Country\n\nHashtag\n\nThe Day The Mississippi Died\n\nTurf The Gambler\n\nHere Stands A Woman\n\nHowdy Howdy\n\nOFFICIAL SITE\n\nADVERTISE WITH LISTENING THROUGH THE LENS\n\nMore Music Adventures Await!\n\nNew music Gillian Welch David Rawlings\n\n***\n\n(Visited 108 times, 1 visits today)"
