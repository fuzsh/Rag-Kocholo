        "text": "Maybe it’s the architecture. Maybe it’s the history. Maybe it’s the just the feeling you get when you walk through the door.\n\nIf you’re like us, old theaters are fascinating, whether they’re restored to pristine beauty, crumbling in decay or somewhere in between. Alabama has plenty of vintage theaters that capture the imagination — old vaudeville houses, retro cinemas, a theater that started out as an elementary school and more.\n\nHere are 10 time-honored theaters throughout the state, listed alphabetically by the name of the venue. Please don’t ask us to pick a favorite, because all these places are compelling, visually interesting and well worth a visit.\n\nAlabama Theatre\n\nWhere: 1817 Third Ave. North, Birmingham.\n\nGood to know: The Alabama Theatre, a beloved landmark in downtown Birmingham, opened in 1927 as a movie theater. It originally was designed to showcase silent movies from Paramount, and the theater’s Mighty Wurlitzer organ was part of the cinema experience, slowly emerging from its hiding place beneath the stage with a musician at the keyboards. The Alabama remained a movie theater for more than 50 years, surviving as times and tastes changed in the entertainment industry. The theater had several owners over the decades, and faced a major decline in audiences in the 1960s and ‘70s. Enter Cecil Whitmire, one of the theater’s organists, who led a grassroots effort to save the theater from bankruptcy during the 1980s. Whitmire became president of Birmingham Landmarks, a nonprofit organization that bought the Alabama, renovated the theater, and turned it into a performing arts center. The 2,500-seat theater was the focus of a $1.5. million restoration project in 1998, and organizers for Birmingham Landmarks continue to maintain and upgrade the venue with care and attention to detail.\n\nComing up: Ray LaMontagne (Sept. 24), The Piano Guys (Sept. 27), Morrissey (Nov. 6), Danae Hays (Dec. 6), Brad Williams (July 12) and more.\n\nMore info: 205-252-2262, Alabama Theatre website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nREAD: Alabama Theatre’s Mighty Wurlitzer is out for repairs: ‘It’s not goodbye, it’s see you later!’\n\nBama Theatre\n\nWhere: 600 Greensboro Ave., Tuscaloosa.\n\nGood to know: “In 1937, the City of Tuscaloosa proposed an unusual project — a combined theater and municipal building,” AL.com’s Kelly Kazek said in a 2021 feature story. “Although it no longer houses City Hall, the Bama Theatre building is still a hub of local entertainment. The building, which still bears a relief of an eagle and the words ‘City Hall,’ is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.” The theater cost $200,000 to complete, including WPA and city funds. The grand opening was held April 12, 1938, kicked off with a parade led by the University of Alabama’s Million Dollar Band. The first film screened was ‘Bringing Up Baby,’ starring Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant.” The theater has seen various renovations over the years, including a new digital marquee in 2017, and is managed by the Arts Council of Tuscaloosa.

Fairview Ave., Montgomery.\n\nGood to know: Now an independent theater, the Capri opened in July 1941 as a movie house called the Clover Theatre. It was remodeled in 1962 and renamed the Capri. “Originally built as part of the Wilby-Kincey chain, the Clover/Capri has had many owners and operators over the years,” the theater’s website says. “Finally in 1982, a group of neighbors formed the Capri Community Film Society to save the theater. ... Fearing the loss of their cherished, but rundown, neighborhood theatre, the Capri Community Film Society took over the lease and operation of the Capri Theatre. Over the years the struggling non-profit managed to keep the theater operating thanks to donations and memberships — and the work of its volunteer board of directors. During that time the theater developed a reputation for its eclectic blend of independent, foreign, popular and classic films.” The film society bought the building in 2010, and launched a fundraising campaign in 2014, raising more than $800,000 for major renovations.\n\nComing up: “Kinds of Kindness” (Aug. 16-19), “Kneecap” (Aug. 23-26), “Sing Sing” (Sept. 6-9), Capri Classics series (Wednesdays, Sept. 25-Nov. 13) and more.\n\nMore info: 334-262-4858, Capri Theatre website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nCarver Theatre\n\nWhere to find it: 1631 Fourth Ave. North, Birmingham.\n\nGood to know: “Opening in 1935 as a movie house, the Carver Theatre was a hub for nightlife in segregated Birmingham’s Black business district,” the Jazz Hall’s website says. “Located on bustling Fourth Avenue North, the theater was one of few screening first-run films for African-American audiences in the era of Jim Crow. It thrived for years, surviving the turmoil of the 1960s. But it could not survive integration, the White Flight into the suburbs, and resulting economic depression in the city’s center. The Carver closed in the early 1980s. In 1990, the City of Birmingham purchased the building with hopes of revitalizing the Fourth Avenue District. The Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, created in 1978 to promote Alabama’s jazz legacy, took over operations of the Carver in 1993. A jazz museum was installed, along with a refurbished performance hall that could show movies as well as host stage performances.” The theater closed for extensive renovations in 2017, and its lobby and performance hall reopened in 2022. The Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame museum was revamped, as well, and reopened to visitors on Aug. 6.\n\nComing up: No events are scheduled at the Carver right now, but bassist Ron Carter recently was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. The Aug. 3 program, “A Cool Jazz Afternoon,” also celebrated the reopening of the Jazz Hall museum.\n\nMore info: 205-327-9424, Jazz Hall website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nREAD: Iconic bassist Ron Carter inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame\n\nLincoln Theatre\n\nWhere: 1926 First Ave. North, Bessemer.\n\nGood to know: The Lincoln Theatre opened in 1948 as a 400-seat movie theater in the heart of Bessemer’s entertainment district, designed primarily to serve Black audiences. “The smell of popcorn filled the air, especially on weekends, and people lined up on First Avenue North to watch screenings of Westerns, horror movies, adventure films and more,” AL.com said in a 2019 feature story. The theater continued to screen movies for about 30 years, changing owners a few times into the mid-1970s. The building was repurposed for other businesses after that, and served as furniture storage space in the early 2000s. Actor Andre Holland, a Bessemer native, bought the Lincoln in 2017, determined to save the decaying theater and transform it into a performing arts space with a single-screen cinema. A nonprofit organization, the Holland Project, took shape that year, and with the help of Holland’s family members, efforts have continued to restore and revive the Lincoln Theatre.\n\nComing up: The Lincoln Theatre isn’t open yet, but fundraising efforts continue for the project. “The mission of the Holland Project is to preserve and protect the Lincoln Theatre, the (nearby) Albano Pharmacy building and other historic Bessemer buildings that may be in danger of neglect or demolition, and to find a use for these buildings that will enrich the lives of Alabama citizens and their descendants,” the theater’s website says.\n\nMore info: Lincoln Theatre website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nREAD: There’s new life at Bessemer’s historic Lincoln Theatre, thanks to actor Andre Holland and family\n\nLyric Theatre\n\nWhere: 1800 Third Ave. North, Birmingham.\n\nGood to know: The Lyric was built in 1914 as an intimate vaudeville house with pin-drop acoustics. After the glory days of vaudeville, the Lyric transformed into a movie house during the early 1930s. The Lyric closed in 1958, reopened for a few years in the 1970s as a revival house and had a brief run as a porn theater. The building was shuttered in the 1980s. The theater spent decades in downtown Birmingham as a dark and crumbling ruin, damaged by water and weather and prey to the ravages of time. Birmingham Landmarks, a nonprofit organization, acquired the Lyric in 1993 and spent more than 20 years figuring out how to revive the theater. Painstaking craftsmanship was required to bring the Lyric’s visual beauty back to life, along with a full-scale overhaul of crucial operating systems such as lighting, plumbing, heating and air conditioning. As the result of an $11.5 million restoration project, the Lyric reopened in 2016 as a performing arts center. The revitalized theater has 750 seats and glows with historic charm, adorned by elegant plaster cupids, burnished wood, smooth marble and shimmering gold paint. Birmingham Landmarks also own the Alabama Theatre, across the street from the Lyric.\n\nComing up: Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives (Sept. 26), T Bone Burnett (Oct. 4), Gillian Welch & David Rawlings (Oct. 13), the Blind Boys of Alabama (Dec. 1), Taylor Hicks (Dec. 20) and more.\n\nMore info: 205-252-2262, Lyric Theatre website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nREAD: How the historic Lyric Theatre was saved: ‘Beautiful ruin’ gets glittering rebirth\n\nOxford Performing Arts Center\n\nWhere: 100 Choccolocco St., Oxford.\n\nGood to know: The historic building, known as the “Grand Old Lady,” started out as an elementary school in 1921. In 1953, it became Oxford City Hall. In December 2001, city government offices moved and the police department occupied the building until 2009. “Alas, the ‘Grand Old Lady’ was empty for the first time in her career, but not for long, the arts center’s website says. “The Oxford Arts Council ... made known the need for a performing arts center to be used as an entertainment venue for musical and theatrical productions. ... After hiring the Montgomery architectural firm of Goodwyn, Mills, and Cawood, Inc. with Mike Hamrick as Chief Architect, the Oxford City Council awarded a bid of $10.4 million to Hale Construction Company in May of 2011 to construct a performing arts center. The original part of the building would serve as the lobby with offices and meeting rooms still preserving the antiquity of the building. The original pine floors, columns and brick exterior would remain intact. The new part of the center, extending from the original building on Choccolocco back to Snow Street, would contain a state-of-the-art theater with approximately 1,200 seats. ... The first performance was May 17, 2013, by the Alabama Symphony Orchestra.”\n\nComing up: Chris Janson (Sept. 8), Air Supply (Sept. 12), Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder (Sept. 20), Straight No Chaser (Oct. 24), Jim Brickman (Dec. 13) and more.\n\nMore info: 256-472-1867, Oxford Performing Arts Center website, Facebook, Instagram.\n\nPrincess Theatre\n\nWhere: 112 Second Ave. Northeast, Decatur.\n\nGood to know: “She is a grand ole dame. The Princess Theatre has been a north Alabama landmark for more than a century,” the theater’s website says. “She began as a livery stable in 1887. Yep — a place to park your horse.” The building was transformed into a silent film and vaudeville playhouse in 1919. “After a facelift in 1941, the Princess emerged with the Art Deco style that remains today and features a brilliantly lit neon marquee that is an icon for the region,” the website says. “Local architect Albert Frahn decorated the auditorium burgundy and gray walls with murals that glow under blacklight ... The Princess reopened on August 7, 1941 as a classic art deco theater with the film ‘Tom, Dick and Harry’ starring Ginger Rogers. In 1978, when the movie house closed, the City of Decatur purchased the Princess Theatre. After a $750,000.00 renovation, the Princess once again reopened and this time as the city’s performing arts center. The 677-seat theater began serving as a stage home for local performing arts groups, providing a multipurpose rental facility for the community, serving as an arts education resource for schools and annually presenting a variety of touring artists in music, theater and dance.”\n\nComing up: The Steel Woods (Sept. 19), Sierra Hull (Oct. 13), Glenn Miller Orchestra (Nov. 2) Ashley McBryde (Nov. 8), The Lone Bellow (Nov. 15) and more.\n\nMore info: 256-350-1745, Princess Theatre website, Facebook.\n\nThe Ritz Theatre\n\nWhere: 111 W. Third St., Sheffield.\n\nGood to know: “Built as a playhouse, The Ritz Theatre was opened on July 9, 1928, with a production of ‘Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,’ according to the Cinema Treasures website. “Louis Rosenbaum was the district manager of Muscle Shoals Theatre, the company that owned the theater, and C.J. Ross was the first manager of The Ritz Theatre. ... The (682-seat) theater had a Wurlitzer organ. It was refitted in 1933 to accommodate talkies and to undergo a sleek Art Deco style makeover. On Saturday January 23, 1933, the theater had another ‘Grand Opening’ when President Roosevelt visited Florence that day. By 1941 Muscle Shoals Theatres was a subsidiary of the Nashville, TN, based Crescent Amusement Co. The Ritz Theatre remained one of Sheffield’s most popular movie houses until it went out of business on June 9, 1951. In 1985, the Ritz Theatre was purchased by the Tennessee Valley Arts Association, and restored to its 1930s appearance, complete with its unusual auditorium side wall decoration, resembling giant fans.” The Ritz now hosts theatrical productions, concerts and films and is available as a rental space.\n\nComing up: “The Wild Women of Winedale,” (Aug. 15-18), The Wildflowers (Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers tribute band, Sept. 6), Seasons of Change benefit concert (Sept. 21), “Girlfriend” musical (Oct. 10-12) and more.\n\nMore info: 256-383-0533, Tennessee Valley Art Association website, Ritz Theatre Facebook, Instagram.\n\nShoals Community Theatre\n\nWhere: 123 N. Seminary St., Florence.\n\nGood to know: The theater opened in 1948 as an Art Deco-style movie house. “It originally sat 1,350 people and was one of four theaters in the world to have slide back chairs,” according to research published by the Alabama Cultural Resource Survey. “On October 21, 1948, the first movie shown in the Shoals Theatre was ‘That Lady in Ermine.’ Tickets for children cost 10 cents and an adult ticket was 45 cents. However, due to economic hardships the theater closed on March 13, 1980. The last Hollywood film shown in the theater was ‘American Gigolo.’ Twelve years later in 1992, a California man by the name of Jackson Canup purchased the Alabama theater. He spent nearly $200,000 on renovations, but was forced to sell the theater after financial difficulties two years later. In 1996 the Shoals Association of Ministers took over the operations and was awarded two grants from the Alabama Historical Commission for restoration projects. In the 2000s, the Shoals Community Theatre Association purchased the theater and currently puts on plays, movies, operas, comedies, ballets and symphonies in the historic venue.” (Read more about the theater here.)\n\nComing up: The nonprofit theater is home to the Zodiac Players and Gingerbread Players.
