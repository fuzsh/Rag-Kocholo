She last released The Harrow & The Harvest in 2011 and Rawlings released Poor David’s Almanack in 2017.\n\nThe new 10-song album Woodland (August 23rd, Acony Records) mingles full band tracks with intricate duet performances all tied together with the duo’s signature sound and lyricism and cements the pair’s iconoclastic position at the forefront of acoustic music.\n\nPre save/Pre-order\n\nWoodland was named for and recorded at Welch and Rawlings’ own Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, TN. Of the album and studio they said, “Woodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last twenty some years. The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.”\n\nListen to the first single and opening track below. Instantly it has that evocative and iconic melodic phrasing and Rawlings exquisite playing, in the form of a full band recording.\n\nWOODLAND TRACK LISTING"
