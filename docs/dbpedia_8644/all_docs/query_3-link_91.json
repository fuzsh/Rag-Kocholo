        "text": "For me listening and experiencing banjo music is an important to me as actual physical playing. Reading about practising and practising different ways of practising is most important for me, I don't want to practise my mistakes. I want to make the most of my practising times, and I really do want to improve. My goal is to be able to be a proficient amateur banjo player that can jam with other musicians, and a proficient background player for a band that wants some banjo background back up. I am extremely nervous about playing and being seen in the public eye, so these goals are my current Mount Everest. So I have to learn to breathe and be present whilst playing my banjo, with another person or other people in the room. I need to learn my pieces off by heart. I need to learn the background chords. I have to learn how to play in a jam situation. So first things first I have to start attending jam sessions etc! I need to grow into the music, and let the music grow within me.\n\nOn a very small and modest level I look into the categories available to choose when blogging, (I so wish we had a practising banjo option to choose) and all the styles and genres available to choose in the adding a video section. So I am delving into Banjo/Building/Setup lessons (at a most basic level, my knowledge base is really small), reading about different musicians, looking up song lyrics, looking at different versions of songs, listening to interviews of banjo players, reading about other people's experiences of listening, practising, playing, and performing, looking at tab, learning about the multilayered levels of the banjo's history throughout time and space as a part of my practising. Some days I do a lot of this, and other days I don't do a lot of this, and some of these things I do a lot more than others, I haven't grown up listening to the banjo or the many different ways of playing, or the genres of music. So I am educating myself. And there is just so many amazing musicians out there, and so many fantastic soulful songs, with so many different covers of various songs - and looking at them and listening to them gives me an insight to the zeitgeist of the times of that recording/writing of that song. So my blog entries range and vary a lot, I guess I am at that point of Generativity versus stagnation is the seventh of eight stages of Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, I am looking for meanings, I am looking for understandings, and I am looking at where I go and what I do through the next part of my journey in this lifetime. So I see art/music as deep underpinnings of our cultures, where I can seek solace, and learn so much of my experiences are part of the common condition of being human, and I get healing, and in those troubled times I get filled up by the music so I can contribute to my communities. So what I write might not be of interest to anyone else, and that is just fine with me. I don't want to persuade or change anyone else, I am a work in progress, and I am working on myself. Writing is a way of me starting to sort things out, and it makes me really ponder and think about what I am doing, feeling and experiencing with my banjo. I just want to write a blog, and I want to read how other people are going with their practising, I find that interesting and inspiring.\n\n\"Caleb Meyer\" Gillian Welch & David Rawlings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nugXkgd_-84 written by Gillian and David, it is another song poignant for our times. The echos of trauma are replayed in our sleep, as in this song, and in our art, and in our lyrics, songs and music. Those echos vibrate through our minds, hearts, bodies, families, communities, and our countries. Each time we tell the truth, tell our stories and the stories of our times, we participate in our culture in a profound manner. Gillian's style cuts out the edifice of a culture swamped in reality TV, glitter, glamour and celebrities famous for being famous. This creates a different creative space, with spaces for some untold, and unconsidered stories. When I first listened to Gillian I didn't get it for awhile, I was too busy being busy, too busy running from the important things that need to be considered, what art and music offers a sick society trying to get well? Perhaps I still learn more each time I listen to Gillian Welch & Rawlings. there is so much depth to their music, and the dialogue that is there in their collaborations. Their music speaks to my heart. Great art echos across all the disciplines and this song makes me think of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".\n\nThis song is interesting in contrast to The Dead South's Banjo Odyssey [Official Music Video] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y4qmWF9TIM&index=4&list=RDB9FzVhw8_bY and I know that they have denied it being about or pertaining to rape culture, but in this post postmodern world where Catherine Belsey's three types of reading compliant, resistant and tactical means who you are and what your are aware, the stories you have listened to in your communities and families brings a way of reading, experiencing and understanding this song. I think it is valid to write about this because if these things are never discussed then how can art, understanding and social change, how can the music grow and create and contribute to social change? How can we be moved by the music/art in our lives.\n\nSo Abigail Washburn wrote \"Shotgun Blues\" Folk Alley Sessions: played by Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5vuO3g35sâ€Œ and it is a song that musically and lyrically opens up another dialogue with those that have written and played before, and those that come afterwards.\n\nPractising on Saturday\n\nI did a fair bit of noodling today. I take my banjo wherever I go, and I was at a hen's party that started at 10am in the morning, so dancing, yoga, games, dancing, eating awesome healthy delicious food, and finished at 9.30pm tonight, so each time there was a break I just went out on the veranda and played away. I am getting much better at remembering my songs off tab. I had three or so sessions of just playing away. It was good. I went through quite a bit. At one stage I went noodling, whilst sitting in my car, which was good. And I can use my car as site of guerilla practising! So another type of practising set up to add my repertoire. So even when I am practising I am learning new ways I can practise, and new ways I can add music to my day.\n\nBlackberry Blossum Part A + Part B,\n\nI went through my Part A + Part B Untitled piece,\n\nmy 5 rolls,\n\nmy chord changes (I am getting a bit faster),\n\n| G | Em | C | D7 | I love playing this one. It resonates with me. I can do the chord changes quicker on this set of chords.\n\nplayed with my new chords and new chord changes,\n\n12 bar chord progression | G | % | % | % | C | % | G | % | D7 | % | G | % |\n\nno progress with my new piece as I lost the tab,\n\nmy simple Cripple Creek Part A + Part B - my teacher corrected my chord changes and it is much better.\n\nGood Night Ladies\n\nI just love the opening of this version of Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn's \"I have been working on the railroad\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZYgc8fxcYâ€Œ I love this song, and the musical arrangement, it reminds me of being a small person, and this song being song to me. I wasn't sure of Abigail's voice when I first heard it but there is so much more to her singing that I got at first, and there is so much depth to the playing, the music, the singing and how it all comes together.\n\nI know very little about banjo music, and the different styles of playing, I am lucky to part of this forum, as so many people have been suggesting musicians/artists/creative people for me to listen to and I am learning so much from broadening my listening range, and I am learning to listen a bit differently - just as a beginner banjo player like me needs to I guess.\n\n5 comments on “\"Caleb Meyer\" Gillian Welch & David Rawlings & Practising on Saturday”"
