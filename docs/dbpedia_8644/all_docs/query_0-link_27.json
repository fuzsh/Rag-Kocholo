        "text": "Songwriter-guitarist-producer David Rawlings has worked alongside partner Gillian Welch since the two met as performance majors at Boston‘s Berklee College of Music, where they auditioned to be in a country band. Since that time, they have released several LPs under Welch’s name and Rawlings has released a pair of albums as the Dave Rawlings Machine. For his third solo effort, he’ll unplug the machine – so to speak – with the August 11th release of Poor David’s Almanack credited to just David Rawlings. See the album’s track list below.\n\nThe album, which follows the dreamy folk-pop of 2015’s Nashville Obsolete, will be the eighth collaborative LP for Rawlings and Welch, and will be released on their Acony Records label, which late in 2016 issued Boots No 1: The Official Revival Bootleg, a deluxe version of the classic 1996 Welch album which is considered a modern Americana classic.\n\nMixing acoustic and electric music steeped in American vernacular, the 10 new songs on Poor David’s Almanack were produced by Ken Scott (the Beatles, David Bowie) and Matt Andrews, capture on analog tape during a week of sessions at Nashville’s legendary Woodland Sound Studios. Guest musicians include Willie Watson, Paul Kowert, Brittany Haas, Ketch Secor from Old Cow Medicine Show, and Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of Dawes.\n\nRawlings and his all-star Dave Rawlings Machine will embark on the first leg of a national tour this August to support Poor David’s Almanack, with tunes from the Dave Rawlings Machine’s pair of LPs also on the set list. See the tour dates below.\n\nPoor David’s Almanack track list:\n\n1. “Midnight Train”\n\n2. “Money Is the Meat in the Coconut”\n\n3. “Cumberland Gap”\n\n4. “Airplane”\n\n5. “Lindsey Button”\n\n6. “Come On Over My House”\n\n7. “Guitar Man”\n\n8. “Yup”\n\n9. “Good God a Woman”\n\n10. “Put ‘Em Up Solid”\n\nTrending\n\nDavid Rawlings’ tour dates:"
