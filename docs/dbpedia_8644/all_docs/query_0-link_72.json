I know nothing of the stuff he’s put out under his own name or the Machine. So please post some of that stuff.\n\nA couple of my recent to me favourites Under Gillian’s name:\n\nCheers,\n\nGeoff\n\nDave does so many things well and he makes it sound easy-the sign of a true Jedi master. His right hand cross picking is great but it's his use of intervals that blows me away. Rather than take up sonic space with bends or power chords he uses intervals-especially close ones like a minor second on adjacent strings that I haven't heard anyone else use to that extent. His solos are mini compositions that really show an understanding of the instrument. Like on Acony Bell, the head/solo is all out of a D chord shape with a descending line in the middle surrounded by sympathetic notes-clever and effective.\n\nI too am a huge fan.\n\nHere's an interview.\n\nI really wanted one of those Epiphone small body archtops until I realized it's really the way he PLAYS it that makes it sound like that, and I can't play one that way...\n\nThey're still cool though. Epiphone re-issued them a few years ago since Dave has driven the value of vintage models through the roof, haha."
