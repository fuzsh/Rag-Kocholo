        "text": "David Rawlings is out with a new record this month on the Acony label featuring 10 new, original tunes. It's his third project under his name, rather than under his partner Gillian Welch's name. But rather than calling the band \"The Dave Rawlings Machine\" as he has in the past, it's now simply David Rawlings. That's because the songs on the record are slightly more in the folk realm than his previous recordings.\n\nPoor David's Almanack features David on lead vocals and guitars with Gillian Welch on harmony vocals (and guitar, drums and body percussion); plus an all-star lineup, including Willie Watson on guitar and fiddle, Brittany Haas on fiddle and Paul Kowert (of the Punch Brothers) on bass.\n\nConsidering that roster, we all wondered who David would bring into the studio for this session. We got lucky. The very same personnel listed above all marched through the door, gathered around one microphone and gave us three songs. Enjoy!\n\nSongs Performed\n\n\"Come On Over My House\"\n\n\"Midnight Train\"\n\n\"Cumberland Gap\"\n\nAll songs from David Rawlings' 2017 album, Poor David's Almanack, available on Acony Records.\n\nPersonnel\n\nDavid Rawlings: guitar, vocals\n\nGillian Welch: guitar, vocals\n\nBrittany Haas: fiddle\n\nWillie Watson: guitar and fiddle\n\nPaul Kowert: bass\n\nHosted and produced by Mike Pengra\n\nEngineered by Michael DeMark\n\nVisuals by Nate Ryan\n\nResources"
