The Cardinals would reach the conference championship game winning against McNeese and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi before falling to Southeastern Louisiana in the title game. Akasha Davis would be named first team all-conference and earn four SLC players of the week honors while she and Portia Adams (also an SLC player of the week) were named to the conference's all tournament team.\n\nSneed served as Hardin Jefferson's assistant girls' varsity coach and being the head coach of the junior varsity team. He helped guide the Hawks' varsity team to the second round of the playoffs. He coached the JV team to a district championship in 2016.\n\nHe recently coached the Cy Fair Elite club team to the Nike EYBL national championship this past July. He also coached AAU teams SBG, Team Sneed, Texas Storm and the Texas Blue Chips. One former player on the SBG squad is currently in training for an NBA team.\n\nFrom 2000-2015, Sneed played professionally in the FIBA league with stops in Colombia, Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, England, Israel, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Uruguay, and the Philippines. He was the top scorer for the Dutch League in 2001 and was a top-five scorer in the Israeli Basketball Premier League. Sneed joined the Houston Rockets for their NBA Summer League in 2001 in the Rocky Mountain Revue.\n\nSneed started his collegiate basketball career at San Jacinto College where he helped the Gators to the 1997 NJCAA National Championship game and earned both NJCAA All-American and TEAC MVP honors. Among his teammates was future NBA star Steve Francis. He would transfer to Memphis in 1997 and finish his collegiate career earning Conference USA first-team and second-team honors while scoring 1,072 points.\n\nA Beaumont native, he averaged 32 points per game as a sophomore and 21 ppg and 13 rpg as a senior for Beaumont West Brook, which earned him first-team All-State honors by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches."
