        "text": "“American folk masters.” —The New York Times\n\n“There’s that harmony blend that no-one else can achieve besides these two. They are so influential…” —NPR Music\n\n“…modern masters of American folk.” – Pitchfork\n\n“The protectors of the American folk song.” – Rolling Stone\n\nGillian Welch’s rich and remarkable career spans over 25 years, and she and her musical partner David Rawlings are a pillar of the modern acoustic music world. They have been hailed by Pitchfork as “modern masters of American folk” and “protectors of the American folk song” by Rolling Stone.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in the early 1990s, Welch was launched into the public consciousness when Emmylou Harris recorded a cover of Welch’s “Orphan Girl.” Her career continued to flourish as her 1996 debut Revival, produced by T Bone Burnett, was released to critical acclaim. Firmly on the roots music map following the release, Welch followed up that Grammy-nominated album release with 1998’s Hell Among the Yearlings, a stark duet record with Rawlings, further solidifying the duo as a force in the folk music scene.\n\nFor her work as executive producer as well as a performer and songwriter on the eight times platinum O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, Welch was awarded the Album of the Year Grammy, and was simultaneously nominated for her own Time (The Revelator), which Rolling Stone called one of the best albums of the 2000s and is widely considered by critics to be one of the best albums of all time. This release was Welch-Rawlings’ first on their own record label, Acony Records, helping to establish the duo’s fierce commitment to independent music.\n\nToday, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, whom the New York Times has hailed as “American folk masters,” announce the release of their 10th studio album, Woodland, via their own Acony Records label on August 23rd. The new 10-song collection mingles full band tracks with intricate duet performances all tied together with the duo’s signature sound and lyricism and cements the pair’s iconoclastic position at the forefront of acoustic music.\n\nWoodland was named for and recorded at Welch and Rawlings’ own Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, TN. Of the album and studio, they said, “Woodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last twenty some years. The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.”\n\nWoodland is their first album since 2020’s All the Good Times, a collection of covers and classic folk songs which earned the duo the 2021 GRAMMY Award for Best Folk Album, and their first album of new original music since 2017’s Poor David’s Almanack. Pre-order or pre-save Woodland here. Vinyl and CD are available to preorder today from the Acony Records Online Store, and the album will be available worldwide on all formats later this fall.\n\nWelch and Rawlings also share the first track off Woodland, “Empty Trainload Of Sky.” Listen to “Empty Trainload of Sky” here."
