        "text": "Big breaking Facebook down globally!!!! 😱🙄😟 Thing that never happened before! Big breaking Facebook down, the biggest social media platform effecting millions of users worldwide, people around the globe have reported the issue while accessing the platform, like having login issues, issues while sharing posts over there, sharing content etc. This outage effect the people globally, and even other meta platform are also suffering distruptions from this outage. Website that went outages has tracked over 3,00,000 facebook outages and over 47,000 outages reports for instagram world wide. The reason behind this outage is still unclear but the technical experts saying they are actively trying to resolve the issue and will get it resolved very soon and apologize for the inconvenience people have faced around the world. #facebook #outage #breakingnews #instagram #meta #people\n\nThree more of my close friends lost access to their Facebook pages in the last few days due to being h@cked. Two have been banned permanently, one more still waiting for a decision from Meta if they will get it back. That's nearly 30 people in the last few months I know personally that have had massive issues with their own accounts and businesses. Surely with the amount of this going on Meta and Meta for Business must be aware of the thousands of people this is happening to. I'm failing to understand their lack of action to this and surely internally at Meta, it must be a concern. Maybe Meta admitting there is an issue is bad press for them and the possibilities of information stolen and business destroyed by unscrupulous people could have massive legal implications for Mr Zuckerberg and his people. I'm no social media expert by any stretch of the imagination. But there certainly is some sort of problem with the security at Facebook and possibly Instagram. My issues with Facebook have seriously made me distrust Threads security and I have so far been reluctant to open an account. X, twitter or whatever it's called this week. is currently a mess as well. There are literally thousands of people having security issues, and few getting helped. An admission of a problem is not a failure, it shows a willingness to fix it. These h@ckers seem to be able to get access to accounts quite easily and can destroy someone not just financially but personally as well. Has social media grown to the point where even the creators of them have lost control? #socialmedia #x #instagram #facebook #meta #metaforbusiness #threads #opinion\n\n🔴 Breaking News 🔴 Facebook/instagram downtime?! 😱 It's not just you! 🚫 Users worldwide are experiencing issues logging in, and the platform has been down for over 30 minutes now. 🕒 This incident serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of our digital infrastructure and the importance of robust backup systems. 🛠️ While disruptions like this are frustrating, they also underscore the need for continuous improvement in technology reliability and resilience.

Many users experienced an outage on both mobile applications and desktop. The outage prompted users to turn to social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter), to express their grievances with a touch of humour through amusing memes. Downdetector, a website that tracks outages, has recorded over 3,00,000 Facebook outages and over 47,000 outage reports for Instagram worldwide. Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said that they are working to fix the problem. \"We're aware people are having trouble accessing our services. We are working on this now,\" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X social media. According to DownDetector, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads, all owned by Meta, have reportedly been down since Tuesday since 9 AM. In India, users experienced issues around 8:56 pm, reporting difficulties in loading content on their feeds. #meta #facebook #instagmeta Meta Instagram\n\nSome months ago I posted about problems faced with Facebook app. My personal account was hacked and soon after FB informed that it will be suspended due the violation of the FB policy. And 2 days after it was closed. Some months after I luckily managed to open a new account with a help of non IT-person. However, the account functions are extremely limited and the few posts I did does not have any visibility. At the same time I am not able to open nor use AD-account. At the same time I am not able to use ADs at the instagram side either. I find this situation very frustrating and weird. At first, it´s have been said for years now that everyone has to be at Meta and everything happens there. If you are not there, you do not exist. So my question is, when and why did we give such a power to one commercial company to decide who exist and who does not? And the most worrying is for me, that there is only handful of person even to questionazing this!! #socialmedia #Facebook #metaworld #business #smallbusiness"
