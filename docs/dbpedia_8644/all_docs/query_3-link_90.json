The country-folk singer-songwriters moved to Nashville in 1993 and have worked there ever since, recording at historic studios like RCA Studio B before buying the legendary Woodland Studios.\n\nTheir acoustic sound draws inspiration from country brother bands such as The Delmore Brothers and The Louvin Brothers. Welch and Rawlings have made iconic records spanning from their first together, Revival, to Welch's latest, The Harrow and the Harvest.\n\nListen to our extended conversation with the duo, in which Welch and Rawlings touch on their experiences in Nashville over the last 20 years. Along the way, they discuss both how the city has changed and what they find unique about their adopted hometown."
