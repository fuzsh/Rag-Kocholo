I’m a ‘AA ‘ fully qualified PGA Professional level 2 Coach at The Cranfield Golf Academy in Chadwell Heath, Essex.\n\nMy Golfing beliefs are Golf should be fun to Learn and Play and there is not a single golf model for all golfers to follow. We are all built differently so a swing should be as unique to every individual as a finger print. With this in mind my job as a coach is to draw the golfer out as a posed to tell someone a single technique.\n\nSo having fun and experimenting with different shots is the best way to find a system to suit the pupil.\n\nany questions please feel free to e-mail me at dre@cga-golf.com\n\nThanks\n\nDavid Rawlings"
