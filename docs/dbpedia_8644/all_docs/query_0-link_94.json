        "text": "Long-celebrated folk duo Gillian Welch and David Rawlings have given us even more reason to extol.\n\nThey have announced the release of their 10th studio album, Woodland, set to arrive August 23. The 10-track follow-up to 2020âs All the Good Times, named for and also recorded at the pair's own Nashville-based Woodland Sound Studios, will feature a delicate blend of full-band offerings and also the intimate duets the musical partners have become well-known for over the last two decades.\n\nâWoodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last twenty some years,\" the two shared of the album and the place it was conceived. \"The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.â\n\nWith the news of this upcoming release, Welch-Rawlings have shared its lead single, 'Empty Trainload Of Sky.' It is a sauntering ballad blending all the very best of the masterful folk pairing, something they will take on the road this fall.\n\n--\n\nWOODLAND Track List:"
