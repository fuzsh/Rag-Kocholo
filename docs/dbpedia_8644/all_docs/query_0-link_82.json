        "text": "Gillian Welch and David Rawlings remember the good rooms, the ones where the sound complements their stripped-down, two-voices-and-two-guitars approach. And that’s why they’re excited about coming back to the Peace Center next Monday.\n\n“It’s a fantastic sounding room, and we’re really happy to be coming back,” Welch says. “We’re basically chamber music, and the Peace Center is a beautiful chamber.”\n\nWelch and Rawlings have been playing their own style of “chamber music” since 1996, taking their cue from largely acoustic music from the pre-rock era and adding their own darker hues to that traditional style. Over the course of nine albums, six under Welch’s name and three under Rawlings’, the duo have blended bluegrass, Appalachian folk, and gospel music into their approach, and in addition to amassing a devoted fanbase, they’ve also won multiple International Bluegrass Music Awards, a Grammy, and an Americana Music Award. In our interview, Welch talked about the difference between her show and Rawlings’, their musical chemistry, and the traditions they draw from.\n\nHas your live show changed much since you and David began collaborating on albums under his name?\n\nNot really, because these shows are Gillian Welch shows, so we’ll be playing songs off Gillian Welch records. When we play shows under his name, we do songs off of David Rawlings records, so it’s pretty straightforward.\n\nIt’s funny, because the fact that we have two bands now seems to confuse people sometimes, but to us, it seems really self-evident. I guess I shouldn’t assume that people know that.\n\nHas the confusion surprised you?\n\nPart of their confusion could totally be explained by the fact that David and I are integral members of both bands (laughs). I’d say the people who understand it the way we do understand that Dave and I are a creative team and are pretty much inseparable. For a couple of decades now we’ve been writing the songs together no matter whose name it’s under.\n\nAt this point in your collaboration, do you and David have a sort of creative or musical shorthand?\n\nI wouldn’t even call what Dave and I have shorthand. We don’t even talk (laughs). It’s probably closer to telepathy at this point. When we first started working together, we’d only known each other for a year or so, but the extraordinary thing was that I’d never really met anyone who aesthetically lined up so much with me, and I think he felt the same way. If we were listening to a record, my favorite parts of my favorite songs would be parts that he would respond to as well. And I would encourage other musicians if you find someone that you’re that in sync with, you might want to consider making art with them. Dave and I never fight about what we want to sound like.\n\nAll of your work has been relatively stripped-down, whether it’s on an album or onstage; what do you prefer about that approach?\n\nI basically grew up playing acoustic guitar singing by myself in my bedroom, and I’m most comfortable singing over an acoustic guitar or two. I like that. It’s familiar to me. I love this tradition of duet singing and playing that was popular in the ’20s and ’30s and into the 1940s, people like the Delmore Bros. and The Blue Sky Boys, and then later into the Everly Bros. It was a blueprint for David and me when we were starting. And part of the reason I think we’ve stuck with it all these years is that when rock ‘n’ roll came along, that acoustic duet was very rapidly abandoned. Artistically, we felt like there was more to do in that genre. It’s really important to Dave and myself that we be able to contribute to the tradition that we are working within.\n\nBut could it also be that you can tell how good a song is when you break it down to that more intimate style?\n\nThere’s that, too. One other thing is that I have really sensitive ears, and I don’t like loud noises. Another is that we love the way acoustic guitars combine in the air when they’re unobscured by other louder instruments. It’s a beautiful sound and it suits the emotional color of the music we make. We love this strange paradox of taking something so tiny, just two acoustic guitars, and making it, through some strange magic trick, seem panoramic."
