Late last year, Rosanne and her husband, guitarist John Leventhal (6 Grammys), also her songwriting, producing and performing partner launched a new record label, RumbleStrip Records to reexamine and rerelease Rosanne's early period recordings originally on Columbia/Sony Music. A 30th Anniversary remastered edition of the Cash/Leventhal produced album The Wheel was the inaugural release followed by John Leventhal's very first solo album entitled Rumble Strip in late January.\n\nSome songs from both these releases will be featured on tour at their concerts this summer. Cash is also an author whose four books include the best-selling memoir Composed, which the Chicago Tribune called “one of the best accounts of an American life you’ll likely ever read.” Her essays have appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Oxford American, The Nation, and many more print and online publications. Her most recent book, Bird on a Blade (2018), was published by University OF Texas Press, combining images by acclaimed artist Dan Rizzie with Cash’s lyrics. In addition to regular touring, Cash has partnered in programming collaborations with Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, SFJAZZ, the Minnesota Orchestra, and the Library of Congress. She served as artist-in-residence at New York University and in 2018 and 2023 she was a resident artistic director at SFJAZZ.\n\nAlong with many other honors and awards, Cash received the 2021 Edward MacDowell Medal, awarded since 1960 to an artist who has made an outstanding contribution to American culture. She is the first woman composer to receive this prestigious honor. Last month she was elected as an Honorary American member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\n‘I consider artists to be in the service industry; the premier service industry for the heart and soul. I am curious to a pathological degree and the Sword of Time hangs over me, and those two things— curiosity and the hourglass— make me feel more urgent than ever to connect, to find community, and to create. It doesn’t matter what the world thinks, it only matters that what is unsaid and what is unseen is given form and has a voice.’\n\nMourning Star & Seventh Cloud Live at Buskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nThu, Aug 29, 2024\n\n8/29/24\n\n7 pm\n\nEngage yourself in a listening room experience live at Buskirk-Chumley Theater.

The film investigates the power of “regenerative” farming systems –from large to small-scale farmers who are the champions of soil health as the key to unlocking more (and healthier) food to feed America and the world.\n\nCast includes: Laura Dern, Rosario Dawson, Jason Mamoa, Woody Harrelson, Ian Somerhalder and Donald Glover.\n\nCommon Ground is the highly anticipated sequel to the juggernaut success documentary, Kiss the Ground, which touched over 1 billion people globally and inspired the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to put $20 billion toward soil health. By fusing journalistic expose’s with deeply personal stories from those on the front lines of the food movement, Common Ground unveils a dark web of money, power, and politics behind our broken food system. The film reveals how unjust practices forged our current farm system in which farmers of all colors are literally dying to feed us. The film profiles a hopeful and uplifting movement of white, black, and indigenous farmers who are using alternative “regenerative” models of agriculture that could balance the climate, save our health, and stabilize America’s economy – before it’s too late.\n\nHenry Cho From Here to There Tour 2024\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nSat, Sep 21, 2024\n\n9/21/24\n\n7:30 pm\n\nhttps://www.henrychocomedy.com/ On February 11, American Stand Up Comedian Henry Cho was inducted as the 229th member of The Grand Ole... https://www.henrychocomedy.com/ On February 11, American Stand Up Comedian Henry Cho was... see more\n\n✖\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nDOOR TIME\n\n7 pm\n\nDURATION\n\n2 hour 0 minutes\n\nSEATING\n\nReserved Seating\n\nShare:\n\nHenry Cho\n\nFrom Here to There Tour 2024\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nComedy\n\nSat, Sep 21, 2024\n\n9/21/24\n\n7:30 pm\n\nhttps://www.henrychocomedy.com/\n\nOn February 11, American Stand Up Comedian Henry Cho was inducted as the 229th member of The Grand Ole Opry. This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nHenry’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special.

Though at first glance Hawktail looks like a superpicker side-project, their all-original music is cohesive and unique, distinguishing them as an ensemble with a sound built from the ground up. Flush with orchestral sweeps and sparse vigils, with strains of the American South and the North Atlantic, this cosmopolitan sound is not what you’d expect from a string band.\n\nVäsen hails from Uppsala, Sweden and is a perennial favorite at the Lotus World Music Festival, leading Bloomington to name a street after the group and the band to name an album after the street: Väsen Street. Olov Johansson (nyckelharpa) and Mikael Marin (viola) will perform on this tour as a duo and together in collaboration with Hawktail for a set not to be missed.\n\nWill-call will be available for pick up at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater box office until 4pm on Saturday, 9/21. The day before the show. After that, will-call will be available for pick up at the venue the FAR Center for Contemporary Arts(505 W 4th St, Bloomington, IN 47404) when doors open for the event.\n\nIf not sold out, tickets will be available for purchase at the door of the venue.

The band consists of Mal Babcock, Mal Benoit, Jo Hockemeyer, and Trevor Webb. The band’s origins are one of cosmic coincidence- an unexpected knee injury during the height of the pandemic gave space for the members to experiment with a new creative outlet: music. Their determination to grow together musically and to create a safe, inclusive space for the LGBTQIA+ community made them darlings of the Bloomington music scene. Two years later, the band has played over 50 shows across Indiana, opening for contemporaries including Kid Sistr, Okey Dokey, Busman’s Holiday and Glad Rags.\n\nIn their debut EP “Welcome to The Matriarch,” the band beckons listeners kindly into their musical home, exploring community, growth and the beauty of being a beginner. In their new album “Be Safe, I Love You,” they throw open all the doors and windows to let sunlight touch the corners of every room. Vines grow tenderly on the walls, and it’s okay if the floors get a little wet from warm summer rain. The Matriarch pushes the boundaries of their sound, weaving together glittery synths, guitar dripping in reverb, and triumphant vocal layers, complete with a cool assuredness that comes with comfort in their craft. Nothing is off limits to sing about- The Matriarch explores climate anxiety and kick-ass cowgirls amongst new revelations about friendship and love.\n\nSyzygy is a queer punk rock band based in Bloomington, Indiana. Inspired by the queercore movement of the 80s and riot grrrl movement of the 90s, they aim to raise awareness through their music on themes such as transphobia, homophobia, relationship violence, sexism, and lived experiences.\n\nKiwanis Indiana Balloon Fest\n\nLawrence County Fairgrounds\n\nFri, Sep 27, 2024 - Sat, Sep 28, 2024\n\nFri, Sep 27, 2024 4 pm\n\nSat, Sep 28, 2024 7 am\n\nFri, Sep 27, 2024 4 pm\n\nJoin us at the Lawrence County Fairgrounds for the international award winning Kiwanis Indiana Balloon Fest!

She brings poetry to themes of Black diaspora, feminism, empowerment, and other social reflections that impact the construction of her emotions.

Her music is sensual, danceable, and a great way to close out the festival.\n\n2024 Lotus Pin will be available for pick up in the lobby of the Buskirk-Chumley Theater when doors open for the event.

ENO offers millions of possible variations and ushers in a groundbreaking approach to storytelling. The result is a viewing experience that resonates with Eno’s own artistic practice, his use of technology to compose music, and the mercurial essence of creativity as his endless pursuit. Defying the hagiographic impulses of the music doc genre, ENO draws from original interviews and the artist’s own staggering archive of never-before-seen footage and unreleased music. This showing will include a pre-recorded Q&A with the Director/Producer Gary Hustwit\n\nREVIEWS:\n\n“There’s a pure joy to this documentary, a sense that creativity is miraculous and we ought to be grateful that we get to participate in it…[Brian] Eno, one of the most innovative and celebrated musicians and producers of his generation, has fiddled with randomness in his musical practice for decades, often propelled along by new technologies…the generative framework makes perfect sense for ENO, a documentary about a man who’s spent his career rewriting the rules of the possible — not just finding a new way to say something, but changing the act of saying itself.” – Alissa Wilkinson, The New York Times\n\n“DAZZLING. More than a biographical documentary, ENO emerges as a brilliant and endlessly inspiring creative manifesto. Eno is an enthralling subject, whose way of talking about art and artmaking is as lucid as it is stimulating. And with its inventive generative gambit formally echoing the very tenets Eno has nurtured in his art for decades, Hustwit’s film boldly paves the wayfor a decidedly new kind of cinema—one that proves as soothing and as stirring as Eno’s own work.” – Manuel Betancourt, The A/V Club\n\n“GROUNDBREAKING. Remixes the music doc.” – David Fear, Rolling Stone\n\n“A template for how cinema can be re-defined in the digital age.” – Daniel Dylan Wray, The Quietus\n\nHiss Golden Messenger Solo Plays Bad Debt and other Favorites Support from Hannah Frances\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nWed, Oct 9, 2024\n\n10/9/24\n\n7 pm\n\nDon’t miss a special solo set from Hiss Golden Messenger, performing the 2010 record “Bad Debt” in its entirety, along...

Coming to Buskirk Chumley Theater on October 9th. Tickets on sale now.\n\nIn 2010, M.C. Taylor—leader, songwriter and singer of Hiss GoldenMessenger—sat down at his kitchen table and started writing and recording the songs that would eventually become his beloved album Bad Debt. At the time, the songwriter was living in a drafty cedar cabin in the woods outside of Pittsboro, North Carolina with his wife and three-month old son Elijah, having recently moved across the country from California. Taylor was, for all intents and purposes, out of the music game.\n\nWhile his child slept, Taylor wrote and sang his finished compositions into a cassette tape recorder, voice and guitar in the same intimate moment. As songs began to coalesce—intimate meditations on labor and joy and love and the heartbreaking, confounding fullness of life—Taylor shared them with his closest friends, feeling as though he had found something special. He had 200 copies of the album pressed on vinyl, created the artwork himself, and sold them out of the trunk of his car. When those copies sold, he pressed and sold another 200. These early, hand-wrought versions have become sought-after relics.\n\nBad Debt was the name Taylor gave to the deep and vulnerable collection of songs he wrote at his kitchen table; it went on to be profiled in the New Yorker, the Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Uncut Magazine, and many other publications, paving the way for Hiss Golden Messenger's critically acclaimed, Grammy-nominated career.\n\nIn the fall of 2024, Taylor will play a series of solo shows during which he will perform Bad Debt in its entirety, in addition to songs from the rest of his celebrated catalog. Keep your ear to the ground.\n\nHannah Frances (b. 1997) is a vocalist, guitarist, composer, and poet that NPR’s Ann Powers calls “a stunning vocalist and songwriter, making monumental and mythic freak folk,” and was awarded Pitchfork’s Best New Music for her triumphant new album Keeper of the Shepherd. Through cutting lyricism and astute fingerpicked polyrhythms, Frances’ perennial sound melds avant-folk, progressive rock, and jazz. There is no singular way Frances grips us with her guitar or her storytelling. Drawing comparisons to Joni Mitchell and Jeff Buckley, her voice is colossal in its strength: piercing, warm, and always poised to embrace, even in its quietest expression. Whether performing as a solo act or with her full seven-piece ensemble, her mythology spellbinds with an insistent gravity.\n\nAll proceeds will benefit Amethyst House. Amethyst House is a Bloomington, IN based not-for-profit substance use disorder treatment program that has been in the Bloomington community since 1980. Amethyst is a United Way agency that provides residential and outpatient services for those recovering from addiction. Amethyst House provides a foundation for recovery by partnering with individuals, families, and communities impacted by substance-use disorders, offering high-quality residential and outpatient treatment services\n\nFresh Horses: Tribute to Garth Brooks\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nFri, Oct 11, 2024\n\n10/11/24\n\n7:30 pm\n\nIf you love Garth, you’ll love Fresh Horses.

Celebrated by The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and The Recording Academy/GRAMMYs with Lifetime Achievement Awards, inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and winners of six GRAMMY® Awards, they have attained the highest levels of achievement in a career that spans over 70 years. The Blind Boys are known for crossing multiple musical boundaries with their remarkable interpretations of everything from traditional gospel favorites to contemporary spiritual material by songwriters such as Eric Clapton, Prince, and Tom Waits. They have appeared on recordings with many artists, including Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Aaron Neville, Susan Tedeschi, Ben Harper, Patty Griffin, and Taj Mahal.\n\nBlind Boys of Alabama released 'Echoes Of The South’ on Aug 25, 2023, which finds the Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductees coming home to honor those they've lost on a bold declaration of how far they still plan to go. The eleven-song collection is a portrait of perseverance from a group well-versed in overcoming incredible odds - from singing for pocket change in the Jim Crow South to performing for three different American presidents, soundtracking the Civil Rights movement, and helping define modern gospel music as we know it. Recently, the group's decades-long mission of spreading light and love has taken on even deeper context as they've reckoned with the loss of two of their own, Paul Beasley and Benjamin Moore, both longtime members of the Blind Boys’ tight-knit family. 'Echoes Of The South' is released in their honor - as well as for the group's recently-retired leader, Jimmy Carter - and keeps the Blind Boys' long-held mission statement at its core: “As long as everybody gives all that they have to give and we sing songs that touch the heart, we'll live on forever.”\n\nIn 2022, the group had a collaborative recording with Béla Fleck, nominated for a Grammy. The nominated collaboration, \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,\" powerfully reimagines the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement, originally made famous by Nina Simone. They also have had collaborative recordings and coinciding tours with both Marc Cohn and afro-pop duo Amadou & Mariam. In 2023, Blind Boys garnered another Grammy nomination for Best Americana Single for 'The Message' featuring Black Violin.\n\n2024 started off the year with a return to the GRAMMY® Awards with three nominations and one win for Best Roots Gospel Album - 'Echoes Of The South.’ This was followed by a sold-out tour in Australia and a sizzling performance with Sir Tom Jones during the Bluesfest Byron Bay (Australia), where video of their rehearsal reached 750K + views in 48 hours on social platforms. The definitive book, titled Spirit of the Century, was released in March 2024. It’s an insider history of the Blind Boys of Alabama, the longest-running group in American music, and the untold story of their world written with band members and key musical colleagues.\n\nThe Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band\n\nBuskirk-Chumley Theater\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2024\n\n11/22/24\n\n7:30 pm\n\nStraight Outta Brown County Indiana!

The Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band is back for a hometown party!\n\nThe latest album from Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band was written by candlelight and then recorded using the best technology available . . . in the 1950s. But listeners won’t find another album as relevant, electrifying and timely as Dance Songs for Hard Times.\n\nDance Songs for Hard Times conveys the hopes and fears of pandemic living. Rev. Peyton, the Big Damn Band’s vocalist and world-class fingerstyle guitarist, details bleak financial challenges on the songs “Ways and Means” and “Dirty Hustlin’.” He pines for in-person reunions with loved ones on “No Tellin’ When,” and he pleads for celestial relief on the album-closing “Come Down Angels.”\n\nFar from a depressing listen, Dance Songs lives up to its name by delivering action-packed riffs and rhythms across 11 songs. The country blues trio that won over crowds on more than one Warped Tour knows how to make an audience move.\n\n“Too Cool to Dance” might be interpreted as the album’s centerpiece for its message of not taking things for granted. The seize-the-moment anthem offers the chorus, “We may not get another chance. Oh, please don’t tell me you’re too cool to dance.”\n\n“Too Cool to Dance” heats up thanks to Peyton’s 1954 Supro Dual Tone electric guitar. Once known exclusively for playing acoustic guitar in the country-blues tradition of Mississippi icons Charley Patton and Bukka White, Peyton has seemingly migrated north and plugged in with Chicago giants Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters.\n\n“It’s crazy,” Peyton says of “Too Cool to Dance.” “It almost feels like a song from the 1950s that’s been lost. At the end of the day, it still somehow feels like us.” To document the livewire immediacy of Dance Songs for Hard Times, the Big Damn Band — including a healthy Breezy — made a pandemic road trip to Nashville to record with producer Vance Powell (four-time Grammy Award winner whose resume includes work with Chris Stapleton and Jack White).\n\nPeyton embraced Powell’s suggestion to turn back the clock and record no more than eight tracks of audio to analog tape. Minimal overdubs are heard on Dance Songs for Hard Times, and Peyton sang while playing guitar live in the studio.\n\n“Vance likes the gear that I like,” Peyton says. “And he has a bunch of cool gear I would only have in my wildest dreams.”\n\nVisually, Dance Songs for Hard Times is led by a video to accompany the song “Ways and Means.” Defined by pastel colors and confident dance moves, the video was made at an old-school laundromat to match the song’s Bo Diddley-boasting on a limited budget: “My knife is sharp, my guitar never flat … king of the laundromat.”\n\nAs Peyton says, it’s difficult to create blues music that isn’t personal. “The song ‘Ways and Means’ was written for all those folks who have the moves, the style, the substance, the talent, but maybe not the seed money or the famous last name,” Peyton says. “All those people who had to work extra hard because they didn’t get to start way ahead. Folks who have been playing catch-up since they were born and had to get really good just to make it to zero.”\n\nRecently Announced\n\nAnother Round’s Winter Concert\n\nThe 2024 NAACP Freedom Fund Awards Dinner\n\nMagic of Motown\n\nThe Matriarch & Syzygy\n\nScream (1996)\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974)\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nBloominGrass Saturday\n\nJazz @ BCT- Latin Jazz Ensemble\n\nAndrew Marlin Stringband"
