Special Merit: Informal\n\nStereophile Quality Analog Home Recordings on Vinyl LP!\n\nPlated & Pressed at Quality Record Pressings!\n\nCovering Songs by John Prine, Bob Dylan, Norman Blake & More!\n\nMichael Fremer Rated 11/11 Music, 11/11 Sonics!\n\n2021 Grammy Award Winner:\n\nâ€¢ Best Folk Album: All The Good Times\n\nAfter a devastating tornado ravaged Nashville in the Spring of 2020 making their studio unusable, immediately followed by a global pandemic shutting down their community and touring livelihood, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings were able to find the inspiration to set up recording equipment in their home living room and record 10 performances on their reel-to-reel of some of their favorite songs from the likes of John Prine (\"Hello In There\"), Bob Dylan (\"Abandoned Love\"), Norman Blake (\"Ginseng Sullivan\"), and more.\n\nAll The Good Times is the first Welch/Rawlings collaboration to feature both of their names on the album, and received the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. Originally released in summer 2020 as a surprise treat for fans, the limited edition handmade CD and LP first pressings sold out in 48 hours as a D2C exclusive.\n\nThis long-awaited vinyl reissue was mastered direct from analog home recordings through custom Ortofon amplifiers to a Neumann VMS-80 cutting system. Plated and pressed at Quality Record Pressings on 150-gram audiophile quality vinyl. Tip-on jackets were made at Stoughton Printing and feature new artwork printed on special linen paper.\n\nYou are sure to enjoy both the music making and the sound throughout. I have to single out, though, the cover of John Prine's 'Hello in There'. If the lockdown didn't occasionally drive you to tears, this 'Hello in There' just might be the ticket. An album of pure music making not to be missed.\n\n-Michael Fremer, Analog Planet, Music 11/11, Sound 11/11\n\n...modern masters of American folk.\n\n-Pitchfork\n\nThere's that harmony blend that no-one else can achieve besides these two. They are so influential...\n\n-NPR Music\n\nThe protectors of the American folk song.\n\n-Rolling Stone\n\nFeatures\n\nAudiophile Vinyl LP\n\nMastered Direct from Analog Home Recordings\n\nMastered Through Custom Ortofon Amps to a Neumann VMS-80 Cutting System\n\nPlated & Pressed at QRP\n\nTip-On Stoughton Jacket\n\nNew Artwork - Printed on Special Linen Paper"
