        "text": "Gillian Welch and David Rawlings have announced their first new album since 2020. The new album, Woodland, is out on August 23 via the duo’s Acony Records. Leading the follow-up to the All the Good Times covers collection is a new song called “Empty Trainload of Sky.” Find it, along with the musicians’ upcoming U.S. tour dates, below.\n\nWelch and Rawlings recorded their new album at their own Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville. “Woodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last 20 some years,” the folk artists said in a press statement. “The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.”\n\nWoodland is Gillian Welch’s first album of original material since 2011’s The Harrow & the Harvest, and Rawlings’ first since 2017’s Poor David’s Almanack. (While billed as solo LPs, Welch and Rawlings were heavily involved in the making of each others’ records.) Since those releases, the musicians have won a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album and been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song (for The Ballad of Buster Scruggs’ “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings”). They also issued the three-volume archival collection Boots No. 2: The Lost Songs."
