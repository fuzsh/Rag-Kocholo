The start of long overdue conversations.\n\nI’ve heard this since my debut novel came out. Readers now open to the idea of forgiveness or reconnecting with loved ones. Readers who are praying through their own mistakes or seeking new directions. Readers addressing the issues weighing them down.\n\nIt’s the power of a parable. Truth revealed through a story that touches the heart.\n\nMy books start conversations. They help with healing when they uncover hidden things. They open hearts and minds.\n\nWelcome to inspirational fiction that tells a great story with a heart, addressing the issues in our lives ranging from emotional baggage to honesty and transparency to discovering how we got to where we are in life. Have a look through and see if you can see yourself or those around you. And get in touch if you do. I’d love to hear from you.\n\nCheers, David"
