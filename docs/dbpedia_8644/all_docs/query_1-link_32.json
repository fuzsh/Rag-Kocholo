        "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- For Rhode Island native David Rawlings, his show Saturday at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel in Providence with the Dave Rawlings Machine is a homecoming of sorts.\n\n\"I'm really excited to be able to play Rhode Island. It's a big hometown show, and I expect my family will probably turn up to hoot and holler,\" said Rawlings, who now lives in Nashville.\n\nRawlings, best known as guitarist and duet partner with Gillian Welch, grew up in North Smithfield and went to North Smithfield High School.\n\nHe remembers walking home from Firehouse Pizza with his friend Glen Chausse when he was about 15. Chausse told Rawlings to ask his parents to buy him a guitar for Christmas. Chausse said he would request a harmonica, and then the two could play Neil Young's \"Heart of Gold\" at the high school talent show.\n\nWhich they did.\n\nCut to last summer's sold-out Newport Folk Festival, when Rawlings and Welch were on stage as part of the 50th anniversary tribute to the time Bob Dylan \"went electric\" at the 1965 festival.\n\n\"It felt so strange to be in Rhode Island, playing Bob Dylan songs in front of a lot of people,\" Rawlings said. \"Playing Dylan songs is what I used to do in my room when I was in high school. It was a strange experience to do that at Newport.\" (Although they sounded just fine.)\n\nAfter high school, Rawlings briefly attended the University of Richmond, then transferred to Berklee College of Music in Boston, although he didn't graduate. By the time he got to Berklee, Rawlings had discovered bluegrass and old-time country music. Berklee, he said, was more a center for jazz and jazz-rock than country in any form, but Rawlings still managed to find a small group of kindred souls.\n\nAmong them was Welch, whom he met while the two of them were waiting to audition for a country ensemble.\n\nWelch and Rawlings have released five albums as a duo, under the name Gillian Welch, and two as the Dave Rawlings Machine. The duo albums are known for a sparse, Appalachian sound and dark subject matter.\n\n\"We write the songs the same way, we're involved in the same way. We're equally part of both projects,\" Rawlings said.\n\nThe differences — besides whose name is on the marquee — are that Rawlings, rather than Welch, sings lead for the Dave Rawlings Machine, and the Machine encompasses a band, including Paul Kowert of the Punch Brothers and Willie Watson of Old Crow Medicine Show. (On the \"Nashville Obsolete\" album, some songs even use a string section.)\n\n\"My voice has a different texture, and the energy is different,\" Rawlings said. \"Mainly, we enjoy getting up on stage and playing a slightly different kind of music. … When we play with the band, it's a lot of fun, but it's also fun to be able to go back and work as a duet.\"\n\nRawlings said themes of traveling — through time and through life, as well as distance — crop up a lot on \"Nashville Obsolete.\" The video for \"The Weekend\" shows Rawlings and Welch on an extended road trip.\n\nAt the show, Rawlings said there's likely to be a cover song or two, plus some of the duo songs rearranged for the band.\n\nRawlings said the title \"Nashville Obsolete\" started as a joke about opening a store to sell obsolete items, such as typewriter ribbons. Then, Rawlings said, they started thinking of the old-school recording gear they use, and the instruments they play. (Rawling's primary guitar is a 1935 Epiphone Olympic.)\n\n\"Sometimes I think we ourselves might be obsolete,\" Rawlings said.\n\nThe Dave Rawlings Machine will perform at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, 79 Washington St., Providence, on Saturday. Doors open at 6 p.m., music begins at 7 p.m. Tickets are $32.50 in advance, $35 day of show, $39.50 for reserved mezzanine seating.
