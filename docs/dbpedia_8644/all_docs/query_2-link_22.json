        "text": "Field Strip And Magazine Fitting Of A New Chinese Norinco SKS Getting ready for Georgia's gun season in a couple of weeks, I have been working with a gun that I purchased decades ago, and I am getting to know the Norinco SKS for the first time. My thoughts on the SKS is that with modern smokeless hunting rounds that it would be fine for taking my deer at ranges of up to about 100 yards with iron sights. Unlike modern guns chambered for the 7.62 X 39 short Russian cartridge like the Ruger Ranch Rifle, this gun does not easily adapt to mounting scope sights, although I suspect some after-market producers have adapters for the dust cover to allow scope or red-dot sights to be mounted. The gun passed its shooting tests satisfactorily for a 100-yard gun, and now it was time to field strip and clean it. This was the first time that the gun had been taken apart since it left the factory. Compared with some combat versions that might have seen a quarter-century of service, this gun was factory tight and difficult to disassemble. After taking it through the process a few times and refitting the magazine and trigger-plate catch, it became easier to take apart to the point I felt that I could complete this video. One recommendation that I offer is that if you are shooting modern smokeless non-corrosive ammo, you only really need to disassemble and clean the upper part of the gun which are in direct contact with gasses of combustion. This can be done without removing the trigger assembly and magazine which gave me the most trouble. I will post later videos about hunting with the gun. I also am going to see if I can design a magazine bock to restrict the gun's capacity to five rounds in an attempt to keep me from running afoul of present or future restrictive gun laws in Georgia or other states."
