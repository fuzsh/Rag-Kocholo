Usually a mix of the two that favors the original music. Covers can be anything and everything, but we will be sure to make them our own and bring a little alt-country vibe to whatever we do. Johnny Cash, Grateful Dead, Turnpike Troubadours, The Band, Ryan Adams, Lucero, The Stones, Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Willie & Waylon just to name a few. We have played hundreds of gigs spanning the foothills as well as Denver, the Front Range and SXSW a few years back.\n\nOpener - Public Picasso\n\nPublic Picasso, a band emerging from the mountains above Denver, Colorado has an eclectic sound pulling inspiration across four decades of soundscapes. Blending catchy indie pop lyrics with surf rock inspired anthems, Public Picasso evokes comparison anywhere from Peach Pit, to Nirvana, to The Velvet Underground.\n\nJuly 10 – Buchanan Field\n\nHeadliner - Drew Dvorchak Band\n\nDrew Dvorchak - Guitar & Vocals\n\nSteven Huntley - Guitar & Vocals\n\nKalel Vigil - Bass & Vocals\n\nMike Dooley – Drums\n\nBlues, Rock\n\nThe Drew Dvorchak Band is blues rock clashing with psychedelic funk while holding true to some of the most traditional folk styles. Their musical diversity stands out as the members of this band have backgrounds in blues, jazz, bluegrass, heavy metal, americana folk, funk & jam. Their grooves & fast paced jams are sure to get you on your feet and dancing!\n\nOpener: Porch Moment\n\nPorch Moment is a folk/singer-songwriter group, similar to the styles of Watchouse, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings. Their individual songwriting and musical styles blend together to create beautiful harmonies, sure to take you on a journey to a place and time where you feel warm and peaceful- much like a moment on your own porch. Mark and Danielle reside in Evergreen, Colorado and you can find them playing music all along the foothills and beyond!\n\nJuly 24 – Evergreen Lake\n\nHeadliner – The Tyler Philips Show\n\nTyler Phillips – Guitar & Vocals\n\nMason Hall – Drums & Vocals\n\nLowen Hall – Bass\n\nBlues, Americana, and Mountain Rock\n\nTyler Phillips is a Colorado multi-instrumentalist, poet, songwriter, and producer. Tyler currently leads The Tyler Phillips Show and draws inspiration from The Band, Gary Clark Jr, Jimi Hendrix, and Leonard Cohen to engage audiences with high-energy, poetic performances that often explode into a fusion of high country blues, Americana, and jam-band-inspired extensions of original music and covers. On January 13, 2024, The Tyler Phillips Show debuted at Snowpack Underground in Conifer, CO and rocked the venue's first ever sold out concert with the Hall Brothers and Andrew Breimayer on guitar. The Show is currently in the studio recording material for their debut album, Greetings from Jackalope City, USA.\n\nOpener #1: Alaithia Rooke\n\nOpener #2: Kailani & Paris\n\nAugust 7 – Buchanan Field\n\nHeadliner - Living Room Band\n\nJoel Fisher – Bass/Vocals\n\nJosh Wunsch – Drums\n\nPeter Mitchell – Guitar/Vocals\n\nDave Recker – Guitar/Vocals\n\nRob Quinn – Percussion\n\nScott Cook – Keyboards\n\nRock, Jazz, Blues, Country, Latin, and Funk\n\nThe Living Room Band was created in 2020 as a platform for the members to push and expand their sonic horizons and test their musical mettle, with a focus on instrumental improvisation. Since then, the LRB has honed their skills to become a six-headed hydra all its own, crafting lyrical and instrumental tunes that intertwine threads of rock, jazz, blues, country, Latin, and funk, as well as performing a variety of fun and familiar covers in a set that is guaranteed to get you moving."
