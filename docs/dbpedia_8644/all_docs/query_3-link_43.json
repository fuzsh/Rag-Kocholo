        "text": "The Milk Carton Kids to make Their Mariposa Debut\n\nPosted on\n\nThis contemporary folk duo from Los Angeles sports a fresh sound with beautifully harmonized vocals, exquisitely entwined acoustic guitar playing, and rootsy yet eloquent song writing.\n\nNational Public Radio says The Milk Carton Kids are like “Gillian Welch & David Rawlings meets Simon & Garfunkel with a splash of The Everly Brothers”.\n\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a standard artist bio for these guys, anywhere online. They would rather you form your own opinion by listening for yourself to their expressive, quirky, warm and delightful performances.\n\nSo confident are they in winning you over, they’re even offering two albums, Retrospect and Prologue, for free on their website. They know that, once you’ve heard them, you’ll want more. Already, there have been hundreds of thousands of downloads.\n\nAfter forming in 2011, The Milk Carton Kids spent most of the next year on the road with other folk acts, including Old Crow Medicine Show and the Lumineers.\n\nThey have performed on late-night’s Conan, the legendary Austin City Limits television show, on Garrison Keillor’s A Prairie Home Companion, appeared on numerous other television and radio broadcasts, and they have a full concert DVD released by National Public Radio on top of four albums to their credit.\n\nFor lots of great photos, videos, posters and other content about The Milk Carton Kids, visit our Mariposa Pinterest Board.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OlL1FqmClhY\n\nDoug Paisley Making a Mariposa Appearance\n\nPosted on\n\nDoug Paisley has an outsider’s keen perspective.\n\nHe taps into the social lifeblood of America, gently and reverently, with songs that are steeped in poetry, harmony and sweetness, and performed with a honeyed, craggy, and knowing voice.\n\nAn artist whose work is not burdened by the trappings of fashion, Paisley ruminates on America’s fate with pleasing authenticity and uncommon clarity.\n\nRefreshing modest, Paisley leaves it to others – the music critics, his peers, and a deeply loyal audience – to sing his praises.\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a lengthy biography or detailed list of music credits about this artist.\n\nAfter all, when one’s body of work speaks so eloquently for itself, little else needs to be said.\n\nLearn more about by visiting our Doug Paisley story board on Pinterest.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uVfFx9JvH4Y\n\nAmerica’s Local Band, Red Wanting Blue, Making at Stop at Mariposa\n\nPosted on\n\nRed Wanting Blue could be described as America’s local band.\n\nWith only the aid of word of mouth, hard work and perseverance, they have established a very loyal following in the Midwest, and regularly fill large venues.\n\nAfter years of hiding in plain sight, now they’re earning national attention. All that can be said about that is, what took so long?\n\nTheir passionate and poetic songs bear the testimony of years and many miles on the road, yet their exuberant performances make it all sound new and exciting.\n\nAnchored by the powerful baritone of Scott Terry, this five man rock & band, with nine albums to their credit, is an artistic and entertainment powerhouse.\n\nTheir last album, From The Vanishing Point, marked their first recording for an established record label. Before that, they releasing their impressive body of music independently.\n\nCheck out our Red Wanting Blue story board on Pinterest.

Now into the fifth decade of his career, he remains a vibrant and productive artist. Many of his songs have been recorded by others, and he has garnered numerous awards and recognition.\n\nHe is also a record producer, playwright and adventurer, whose times away in far flung places such as Antarctica, South Georgia, the Falklands, Scotland , Iceland , Greenland and the Canadian Arctic have provided him with rich creative fodder.
