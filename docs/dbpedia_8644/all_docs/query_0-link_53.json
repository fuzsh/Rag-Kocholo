Rather it's a living room recording done right ... You are sure to enjoy both the music making and the sound throughout.\" â€” Music = 11/11; Sound = 11/11 - Michael Fremer, AnalogPlanet.com. To read Fremer's full review click here.\n\nOriginally released as a handmade, limited edition in July 2020.

Named the 2021 Grammy winner for Best Folk Album!\n\nMusic\n\nSound\n\nRatings from Michael Fremer @ AnalogPlanet.com"
