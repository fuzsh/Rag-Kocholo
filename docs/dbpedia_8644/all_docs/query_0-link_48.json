        "text": "Dave Rawlings Machine\n\nAllmusic Biography : Guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer David Rawlings is best known for his longtime collaboration with musical partner Gillian Welch, with whom he has written and recorded a number of critically acclaimed folk and neo-traditional albums. He has also produced and collaborated with artists like Old Crow Medicine Show, Ryan Adams, Robyn Hitchcock, and Conor Oberst, among others. In 2009, he launched his solo career, releasing his debut album, Friend of a Friend, under the name Dave Rawlings Machine. Essentially a continuation of his partnership with Welch, but with his songs and voice taking the lead role, the band also featured members of Old Crow Medicine Show, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, and several others. Like his work with Welch, the album was largely in the neo-traditional acoustic style and showcased his high lonesome tenor vocals and inventive guitar work played, as always, on his signature instrument, a 1935 Epiphone arch-top guitar. After Rawlings involvement in various other projects, including his and Welchs fifth LP, Dave Rawlings Machine returned again in 2015 with their sophomore LP, Nashville Obsolete, again on Welchs Acony Records.

On his version of the Bright Eyes song Method Acting, imagine a more direct explanation of A Friend of a Friends genesis. Singer/guitarist/songwriter/producer Rawlings has worked with Bright Eyes and Old Crow Medicine Show in the past, and members of both bands return the favor by appearing here, but of course hes best-known for being Gillian Welchs musical foil throughout her career. After a decade-and-a-half spent as the shadowy figure in the background, chiming in with those reedy harmonies and concise guitar licks on demand, Rawlings is long overdue for this solo debut. While he has hidden light under a proverbial bushel, he hasnt been concealing any unexpected predilections -- the overall approach here is pretty much in line with that of the albums hes made with Welch, which makes sense, considering that he was the producer on half of those. The biggest difference is a slightly more expanded sonic palette, a result of Rawlings bringing his aforementioned buddies on board, in addition to Tom Pettys ivory-tickler Benmont Tench and of course, longtime singing partner Welch. But even though a string section pops up on a couple of tunes, A Friend of a Friend is essentially a low-key, acoustic-based Americana outing that feels more like a 21st century version of the early-â70s Laurel Canyon cowboy aesthetic than anything else. The old, new, borrowed and blue song selection is balanced to present a quintessential picture of where Rawlings is coming from; he tackles Ryan Adams and Old Crow tunes he co-wrote, covers cohorts Bright Eyes as well as inspirations Neil Young and Jesse Fuller, and rounds things out with a batch of new Rawlings/Welch compositions. And while he doesnt exactly adopt an in-your-face approach to the leading-man role, preferring to become part of the powerful collective hes assembled, Rawlings proves himself fully capable of taking the reins and leading this horse wherever he wants it to go.
