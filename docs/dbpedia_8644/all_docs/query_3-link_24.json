        "text": "The inseparable americana duo of Gillian Welch & David Rawlings can do no wrong. Here they take part in a tribute record for John Anderson that was produced by The Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach and noted Nashville producer David Ferguson. A Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, Anderson has enjoyed 60 charting singles in four consecutive decades including five No. 1 songs: ‘Wild and Blue’, ‘Swingin’, ‘Black Sheep’, ‘Straight Tequila Night’ and ‘Money in the Bank’. ‘I Just Came Home for the Memories’ , performed on this tribute by Welch & Rawlings is one of Anderson’s most poignant songs. The video features an unsmiling main character that drives her old truck under heavy grey clouds in the American West. Plateaus loom in the distance as cellos swell beneath the subdued melody.\n\nAlong with Welch & Rawlings the album, ‘Something Borrowed, Something New’, features covers by a cast of americana all-stars including Sierra Ferrell, Jamey Johnson, Sturgill Simpson, Tyler Childers, Del McCoury, John Prine and more.\n\nOf the record, Anderson shares, “Listening to everybody do their own takes on the songs shows how the songs really come through. And I thought to myself, ‘You might have been young and foolish back then, but you sure did pick some good songs.’ It’s very gratifying to know that some things really do not change, and a great country song remains a great country song. Any one person on the record would be a real tribute, but all of them together? It’s a pretty big deal for me personally.”\n\nThe full album will be released worldwide on August 5, 2022 by Easy Eye Sound."
