        "text": "Gillian Welch’s rich and remarkable career spans over twenty - five years, and she and her musical partner David Rawlings are a pillar of the modern acoustic music world. They have been hailed by Pitchfork as “modern masters of American folk” and “protectors of the American folk song” by Rolling Stone. After moving to Nashville in the early 1990s, Welch was launched into the public consciousness when Emmylou Harris recorded a cover of Welch’s “Orphan Girl.” Her career continued to flourish as her 1 996 debut Revival, produced by T Bone Burnett, was released to critical acclaim. Firmly on the roots music map following the release, Welch followed up that GRAMMY nominated album release with 1998’s Hell Among The Yearlings, a stark duet record with Rawli ngs, further solidifying the duo as a force in the folk music scene. For her work as executive producer as well as a performer and songwriter on the eight times platinum O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, Welch was awarded the Album of the Year GRAMMY, and was simultaneously nominated for her own Time (The Revelator) which Rolling Stone called one of the best albums of the 2000s and is widely considered by critics to be one of the best albums of all time. This release was Welch - Rawlings’ first on their own record label, Acony Records, helping to establish the duo’s fierce commitment to independent music. 2003’s Soul Journey was the pair’s first experimentation with a fuller, electric sound, which paved the way for the Dave Rawlings Machine project, and t heir first release under Rawlings’ name (A Friend of A Friend, 2009), which was accompanied by a time period of heavy touring and headlining major festivals while biding their time to return to the duet sound the two were traditionally known for. 2011’s Th e Harrow and The Harvest was nominated for for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Best Engineered Album at the GRAMMYs, and won Artist of the Year (Welch) and was nominated for Instrumentalist of the Year (Rawlings) at the Americana Honors & Awards. The alb um garnered glowing reviews and topped multiple year end “Best Of” lists. In celebration of the twenty year anniversary of the Welch - Rawlings partnership, the two launched an archival branch of Acony Records, entitled Boots, dedicated to releasing outtakes , demos, bootlegs, and live recordings from their copious vault. Thus far they have released five album’s worth of music with more on the way.\n\nIn 2018, Welch was the first musician to receive the Thomas Wolfe Prize for Literature. The award is bestowed by University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Department of English & Comparative Literature and recognizes contemporary writers with a distinguished body of work. 2019 saw Welch and Rawlings nominated for an Academy Award for “Best Original Song” where they performed their singing cowboy duet, written for the most recent Coen brothers’ film, live on the show. In 2020 the duo released All the Good Times, the first album under both their names, and won the GRAMMY for the Best Folk Album. Recently, they were cro wned with the Berklee American Masters Award and honored by Americana Music Association with a Lifetime Achievement for Songwriting. Welch and Rawlings continue to tour the world in support of their music while simultaneously writing and lending their tale nts to countless fellow artists’ projects. They are continuously working to release their acclaimed catalog on phonograph records of the highest possible fidelity."
