It produced the album/DVD No Quarter, which is pretty excellent -- filled with interpretations of old LZ material with a Middle Eastern flavor. \n \nLooks like a triple-neck with mando, 12 string guitar, and 6 string guitar.  (He was known for his 12 string / 6 string doublenecks, but this is the first time I've seen one with a third neck.) \n \n118001",

        "text": "Good call on the Manson triple-neck, there. Makes sense, being British and all.\n\nAs for the gimmick thing: Yep, I tend to feel the same way; then again, an element of showmanship is always needed when you're, well, puttin' on a show.\n\nI read a biography of Jimmy Page recently and found it quite revelatory; it's made me reconsider my previously dismissive attitude towards LZ. Apparently he made his name as a session player long before LZ, and was really the brains behind the outfit (so to speak), often producing and arranging as well as playing the 6 and 12 string guitar. I'm finding myself listening to some of LZ's softer, more acoustic-oriented material (yes, it does exist, it just doesn't get much airplay.)\n\nPage justifies his use of the double-necked guitar (and presumably the triple-necked mando-6-12) on the basis of simple stage practicality; he says that he often changes between 6 and 12 string guitar in the midst of a song (or between two songs played one right after the other with no break in between) and that switching guitars on stage frequently can be cumbersome and awkward (not to mention taking up precious time and breaking the momentum.) Thus the double-neck, or the triple-neck in this case. (He didn't use a guitar/bass double neck, obviously, because they already had a bassist, John Paul Jones.)\n\nNaturally, changing strings and tuning aren't an issue ... that's what paid techies are for.\n\nHere's a nice interview with Andy Manson with plenty of photos and back stories on his various creations for rock heroes and others. Manson also built the first \"Blarge\" for Donal Lunney.\n\nI saw Al Stewart do a solo acoustic show back in the mid '70s sometime, and he was playing an acoustic triple neck of some sort, too. I remember that it looked pretty cool but sounded really thin, and I think it was a short-term gimmick for him.\n\nFWIW, hurdy gurdys ....are cool....and as expensive as a good mando, and apparently far more temperamental.\n\n....quashed any impulsive HG-AS I had after watching the LZ video. Unique sound, but , well lets just say, I would have think a bit about how to integrate it into a lot of music.\n\nI am a huge fan of Page and LZ.\n\nhaving hoisted a double necked guitar, a JP SG/12 string, as well as a fender tele /mando clone ,\n\nI am pretty sure one does this out of convenience rather than desire....\n\nthey make a les paul feel like a lei by comparision..."
