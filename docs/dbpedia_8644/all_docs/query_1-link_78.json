Beloved husband of 47 years to Pamela Rawlings; loving father of Courtney (Ryan) Sweeney, Kristen (Brian) Blum, and Kevin Rawlings; proud grandfather of Alexa and Landon Blum and Madison Sweeney. He is also survived by a mother-in-law, Jean Smith, and a brother-in-law, Steve (Pam) Smith. Dave was a son of the late Thomas and Nola Rawlings, and the brother of the late Marc Rawlings.\n\nDave graduated from Beaver Area High School in 1969. He received his Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1973 and his MBA from the University of Pittsburgh in 1978. Dave had a successful career working for Consolidated Natural Gas, G.C. Murphy Company, Coopers & Lybrand, Arthur Young and IBM. He retired from IBM after 16 years as a Partner/VP in their consulting business.\n\nDave attended Bethel Presbyterian Church where he served on the Finance Committee. He was a sports fan, especially of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dave had a great sense of humor and laughed easily. He loved spending time with his family and friends, watching his grandchildren play hockey and soccer, travel, family beach vacations, and long daily walks with his golden retrievers Bailey and Bella on the Montour Trail. He will be dearly missed by everyone that knew and loved him. A memorial service will be held at a later date.\n\nMemorial donations may be made in his name to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Eastern Great Lakes Chapter, 333 E Carson St. Pgh.
