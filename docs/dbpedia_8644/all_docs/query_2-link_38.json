        "text": "John's is the only answer - if you need to stick to G. I guess for the shape(s).\n\nOther options are available. With capo on fret 4, there's C Am G F.\n\nCapo on fret 2, there's D Bm A G.\n\nBoth of which coincidentally contain the 'G shape'. You ask about 'using G shapes', which will be practically impossible in any key - after all, there's a minor shape in there! But I'm sure that's not exactly what you meant. But with the last two options, at least you get to play a 'G shape' chord !\n\nThe only other option I can think of if you want to play the song in E with G shapes is to tune down 3 semitones to C#, F#, B, E, G#, C# from low to high. That is a pretty large interval to detune so unless you use heavy strings the strings would probably be too loose and floppy."
