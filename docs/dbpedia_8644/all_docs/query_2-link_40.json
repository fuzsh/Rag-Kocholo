        "text": "“When is this article going to run?” he asks at the beginning of our conversation. “Because the lineup hasn’t been announced yet.”\n\nSo far the Dave Rawlings Machine, which plays Neighborhood Theatre Monday, is advertised as Americana’s reigning royal couple (you rarely meet young roots musicians who aren’t influenced by them) with members of Led Zeppelin, the Punch Brothers and a former member of Old Crow Medicine Show. It’s not hard to figure out which Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is joining them on tour.\n\n“Anybody who really wanted to figure out this lineup probably could have,” laughs Rawlings. John Paul Jones has sat in with him and Welch on tour in the UK. Willie Weeks (who left Old Crow in 2011 and has previously played with the duo) and Punch Brothers’ bassist Paul Kowert round out the band.\n\nJones was busy focusing on writing an opera when Rawlings approached him with the idea. At first he wasn’t game.\n\n“He called back two days later and said, ‘You know, that sounds like a good bit of fun.’ We found a window where everyone was available and put it on the books pretty recently,” says Rawlings. The show was just announced last month, but Rawlings doesn’t like to plan too far in advance. “I drive booking agents and business people crazy.”\n\nThe show will touch on Rawlings’ 2009 album, “A Friend of a Friend,” which he and Welch made with friends as an outlet for songs that Rawlings sang and as a way to get back into recording mode before Welch’s 2011 album. Perhaps more importantly, the tour will also be a unique concert experience for both the crowd and the band, who, as of Monday, had not yet rehearsed.\n\n“I love that I can put together a group of people that have never played together and with no rehearsal. ... There’s a beautiful thing about this kind of music that we’ll be able to play a show for people and they’ll be able to experience what we’re experiencing – the fun of finding your way through music and everyone contributing what they do using this common language,” Rawlings explains. “I tried to put together an evening of music like we would if these people got together at a house.”\n\nWelch and Rawlings are long past playing house shows. He is best known for his impeccable guitar picking and ample contributions to music recorded under Welch’s name. He’s produced, written and recorded with Old Crow, Welch and Ryan Adams. In 2012 the Americana Music Association named him instrumentalist of the year. (Welch was named artist of the year.)\n\nThe flexibility of the Machine allows the couple to shake things up live while not disappointing Welch’s fans.\n\n“When you have four or five records out, by the time you work through everything people want to hear there isn’t much space,” he says. “(The Machine) has released nine songs, so there’s plenty of room for shaking things up.”\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nPREVIEW\n\nTHE DAVE RAWLINGS MACHINE\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Monday.\n\nWHERE: Neighborhood Theatre, 511 E. 36th St.\n\nTICKETS: $25.\n\nDETAILS: 704-942-7997\n\nwww.neighborhoodtheatre.com.\n\nDave Rawlings Machine\n\nCat's Cradle, Carrboro\n\nSunday, Nov. 24, 2013\n\nDave Rawlings and Gillian Welch have played Cat’s Cradle both as a duo and in full-band Dave Rawlings Machine form, and they’ve been a treat to take in at such an intimate venue, regardless of the format. But Sunday night’s show—one of just seven on a Dave Rawlings Machine tour of the Southeast—upped the ante with a star-studded lineup.\n\nPhoto by Michael Rank\n\nDavid Rawlings fronting his Machine at Cat's Cradle.\n\nJoining Rawlings and Welch were John Paul Jones on mandolin, the Punch Brothers’ Paul Kowert on bass and former Old Crow Medicine Show member Willie Watson on guitar, fiddle and banjo. A cast of that caliber—particularly Led Zeppelin member Jones, who’s accustomed to rooms far bigger than the 750-capacity Cradle—might have overshadowed Rawlings and Welch, but the players proved to be vital cogs in the Machine.\n\nAlthough this iteration of the Machine has been together less than a week including rehearsal time, you wouldn’t know it from listening to them. Jones was an admirable instrumental foil to guitarist Rawlings; each played with restraint when appropriate but shredded a solo when it came time to let it rip. They often wound their leads around one another’s playing, using each other as a springboard. Watson and Kowert excelled when they broke out the bows for slower numbers, while longtime Uncle Earl and Toubab Krewe fiddler Rayna Gellert sat in on several numbers and fit right in.\n\nSave for “How’s About You,” the group worked through the entirety of Rawlings’ 2009 debut A Friend of a Friend. The golden chorus of “Ruby” was radiant with four-part harmony, while the medley of Bright Eyes’ “Method Acting” and Neil Young’s “Cortez the Killer” moved from a showcase of the perfect intertwining of Rawlings and Welch’s voices to an extended instrumental workout. The hymnlike “I Hear Them All”—performed as a trio with Rawlings, Welch and Watson—turned from a reverent sing-along to a rallying cry as it transitioned into Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land” and back, receiving one of the night’s loudest ovations.\n\nPhoto by Michael Rank\n\nJohn Paul Jones joins in on mandolin during the David Rawlings Machine show.\n\nPerformances billed as the Dave Rawlings Machine typically turn out as more of a musical revue, and this one was no different. Watson and Welch each took multiple turns on lead vocals, the latter delivering two of the strongest songs in her catalog: “Look at Miss Ohio” and “Wayside/Back in Time.” Kowert also had a featured vocal on “He Will Set Your Fields on Fire,” an old gospel number.\n\nThroughout the night, the group pulled largely from an updated American songbook. Bookended by “Will the Circle Be Unbroken?” and “The Weight,” the show—which spanned a pair of hourlong sets, plus two encores that added nearly another 30 minutes—included traditional classics such as “Turn Your Radio On,” “Stewball”) and “Midnight Special,” as well as tunes by songwriting legends Bob Dylan and Merle Haggard.\n\nIt wasn’t until Jones finished his solo in Dylan’s “Queen Jane Approximately” for second set’s finale that the good-humored Rawlings finally introduced him, the audience erupting appropriately in a true rock ’n’ roll moment. Rawlings led off the first encore by singing the Zeppelin classic “Going to California,” giving Jones and his mandolin another moment in the spotlight, even if he was clearly content to play in the shadows. It was evidence of the magic between Rawlings, Welch and their Machine mates that the crowd seemed to prefer that arrangement just fine.\n\nhttp://www.indyweek.com/scan/archives/2013/11/25/live-dave-rawlings-machine-cranks-up-the-cradle\n\nDave Rawlings Machine\n\nNeighborhood Theatre\n\nNov. 25, 2013\n\nDAVERAWLINGSMACHINE.COM\n\nDave Rawlings Machine in Knoxville, Tenn.\n\n\"John Paul Jones!\" Dave Rawlings grinned as he pointed across the stage to the mandolin virtuoso and legendary Led Zeppelin member. \"He's right there!\"\n\nIt was a typical display of Rawlings' warm and quirky humor before a packed house at the Neighborhood Theatre, but it was also window on Rawlings' open heart and infectious enthusiasm. An inspired, incendiary guitarist, Rawlings is no slouch in the hot-shit-instrumentalist category, yet he simply could not believe his good fortune to be sharing the stage with such deft and simpatico musicians.\n\nRawlings' good fortune also shined on the appreciative, sometimes raucous, crowd. They were treated to two full sets Monday night. Highlights included Jones' lyrical, bluesy chops on the Charley Jordan cover \"Keep It Clean,\" where the former Zep man's mandolin runs intertwined with Rawlings' nimble flat picking. Their muscular interplay and delicate filigree echoed \"Bron y Aur Stomp\" amid the old-timey tune.\n\nYet Jones was not the only shiny cog in Rawlings' string-driven machine. With earthy and witty good cheer, long-time musical partner Gillian Welch greeted the audience. \"I gotta make an apology,\" she confided, \"This band is having the worst bad hair day ever.\" Welch blamed the band's previous stop on their tour. \"It must be that Chapel Hill water.\" Yet Welch's bad hair didn't hamper her dusky luxurious voice which turned clear and powerful on the Dylanesque \"Wayside,\" and high-spirited and harmonious on the down-home rave-up \"To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High).\"\n\nThroughout the evening, Welch and Rawlings dueted as one. It seemed that these two singers could feel each other, adjusting telepathically on their harmonies.\n\nOn any other team, Welch would be MVP, yet the ace combo was rounded out by bassist Paul Kowert and guitar and fiddle maestro Willie Watson. Heeding Rawlings' exhortation to \"make this one burn,\" Kowert stepped up to the mic. His low, sub-woofer voice propelled the band's' off-the-rails take on Bill Monroe's rollicking mountain hymn, \"He Will Set Your Fields on Fire.\" Watson also grabbed the vocal spotlight, encouraging the crowd to sing along to \"Screwball.\" His powerhouse belting pumped the quirky traditional with demented corkscrew humor.\n\nDespite the loose-limbed, hand-crafted charm of the acoustic Machine's presentation, this was a crack crew, imbuing their mix of covers, trad tunes and Welch's back-catalog with the slipknot precision of the best jazz combos.\n\nDespite the simple hoe-down origins of some of their material, Rawlings' band stretched out on otherworldly improvisations before snapping back like a rubber band to bring it all back home. As a front man, Rawlings was a sunny-natured ball of energy. Live, his vocals were full and rounded, and less reedy than they sound on record.\n\nOn the Dylan cover \"Queen Jane Approximately,\" Rawlings channeled ornery old Bob's cadence, but was a much better singer. It was on the covers that these ace players truly shined. Conor Oberst's \"Method Acting\" became a soul-baring ballad before free-falling into a fiery rendition of Neil Young's \"Cortez the Killer\" which left the Neighborhood audience temporarily stunned.\n\nAn impassioned medley joined Rawlings' and Old Crow Medicine Show's \"I Hear Them All\" to Woody Guthrie's \"This Land is Your Land.\" In the hands of Rawlings' crew, the Guthrie chestnut transformed into a dramatic barn-burner, truly earning its unofficial status as the alt National Anthem. Rawlings' inclusion of the tune's usually excised left-leaning verses could make property rights obsessed Libertarians a touch uneasy.\n\nAs the band returned for an encore, Welch assured the crowd that they would approve of their song choice. She was right. The crowd went wild for their rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\" which leapt from delicate madrigal to hypnotic acoustic psychedelia. Rawlings hit the tune's challenging high notes, and the mics switched to echo effect as all hands jumped in on the vertiginous bridge.\n\nIt was entirely fitting that this evening of perfect yet quirky and thought-provoking Americana was capped with a rambunctious take on The Band's \"The Weight.\" As Rawlings, Welch, Kowert and Watson traded off the rolling, rough-hewn verses, it felt - for this evening at least - that Rawlings' well-oiled machine had taken the load off our shoulders by lightening our hearts.\n\nhttp://clclt.com/theclog/archives/2013/11/26/live-review-dave-rawlings-machine-neighborhood-theatre-11252013"
