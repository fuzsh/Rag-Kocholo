        "text": "For the first time in four years, a new Gillian Welch and David Rawlings album is on the way. In fact, it will be out just five weeks from now. Woodland is named for the couple’s Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, which was badly damaged by a tornado but is back up and running now. The folk legends shared this statement about the project and its inspiration:\n\nWoodland is at the heart of everything we do, and has been for the last twenty some years. The past four years were spent almost entirely within its walls, bringing it back to life after the 2020 tornado and making this record. The music is (songs are) a swirl of contradictions, emptiness, fullness, joy, grief, destruction, permanence. Now.\n\nAlong with the album announcement, the duo has shared opening track “Empty Trainload Of Sky,” a bluesy folk song you can hear below.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 “Empty Trainload Of Sky”\n\n02 “What We Had”\n\n03 “Lawman”\n\n04 “The Bells And The Birds”\n\n05 “North Country”\n\n06 “Hashtag”\n\n07 “The Day The Mississippi Died”\n\n08 “Turf The Gambler”\n\n09 “Here Stands A Woman”\n\n10 “Howdy Howdy”\n\nTOUR DATES:\n\n07/23 – South Burlington, VT @ Higher Ground SOLD OUT\n\n07/24 – Northampton, MA @ Iron Horse Music Hall SOLD OUT\n\n07/25 – Northampton, MA @ Iron Horse Music Hall SOLD OUT\n\n07/27 – Newport, RI @ Newport Folk Festival SOLD OUT\n\n09/04 – Bowling Green, KY @ SKyPAC\n\n09/05 – Bloomington, IN @ The Bluebird\n\n09/06 – Evanston, IL @ Cahn Auditorium\n\n09/08 – Madison, WI @ The Orpheum Theater\n\n09/09 – St Paul, MN @ The Fitzgerald Theater\n\n09/10 – St Paul, MN @ The Fitzgerald Theater\n\n09/12 – Des Moines, IA @ Hoyt Sherman Place\n\n09/14 – La Vista, NE @ The Astro\n\n09/15 – Kansas City, MO @ Folly Theater\n\n09/16 – St Louis, MO @ The Sheldon\n\n10/13 – Birmingham, AL @ The Lyric Theatre\n\n10/14 – Atlanta, GA @ Atlanta Symphony Hall\n\n10/15 – Charlotte, NC @ Knight Theater\n\n10/17 – Boone, NC @ The Schaefer Center for the Performing Arts\n\n10/18 – Knoxville, TN @ Bijou Theatre\n\n10/19 – Asheville, NC @ Thomas Wolfe Auditorium\n\n10/21 – Charleston, SC @ Charleston Music Hall\n\n10/23 – Saxapahaw, NC @ Haw River Ballroom\n\n10/24 – Saxapahaw, NC @ Haw River Ballroom\n\n11/20 – Louisville, KY @ The Brown Theatre\n\n11/21 – Cincinnati, OH @ Taft Theatre\n\n11/22 – Detroit, MI @ The Masonic Temple\n\n11/23 – Akron, OH @ Goodyear Theater\n\n11/25 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Byham Theater\n\n11/26 – Ithaca, NY @ State Theatre of Ithaca\n\n11/27 – Troy, NY @ Troy Savings Bank Music Hall\n\n11/30 – Kingston, NY @ Ulster Performing Arts Center\n\n12/01 – Boston, MA @ The Wilbur\n\n12/03 – Portland, ME @ State Theatre\n\n12/05 – Port Chester, NY @ The Capitol Theatre\n\nWoodland is out 8/23 on Welch and Rawlings’ Acony Records."
