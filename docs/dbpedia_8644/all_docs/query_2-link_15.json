        "text": "The Newport Folk Festival kicked off lineup announcements for its 2024 event on Friday, February 2, with the news that Gillian Welch and David Rawlings would return to Newport.\n\nWelch and Rawlings, who was born in North Smithfield, Rhode Island, are a Grammy Award-winning American folk duo known for their distinctive blend of traditional folk, country, and Americana music. They have released eight studio albums together, including their self-titled debut in 1996 and their most recent, “All the Good Times,” in 2020.\n\n“ARTIST ANNOUNCEMENT: We are beyond excited to welcome Gillian Welch and David Rawlings back home to Newport Folk this summer,” Newport Folk Festival shared on social media.\n\n“For their Artist Give, Gill & Dave asked Newport Festivals Foundation to make a grant to Operation Encore,” Newport Folk Festival shared. “The Rhode Island based organization provides opportunities for veteran singer-songwriters to take their careers to the next level through artist development, professional recording, and industry-focused educational services. The funds will be used to support sending five veteran artists to attend a veteran music industry boot camp the week of Veteran’s Day 2024”.\n\nIn Newport Folk Festival fashion, organizers of the event will announce the line-up for the sold-out event one by one over the weeks ahead.\n\nThe festival occurs at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, Rhode Island, on Friday, July 26; Saturday, July 2; and Sunday, July 28, 2024.\n\nThe 2024 Newport Folk Festival lineup is sold out. General admission tickets went on sale on February 1 and sold out within minutes. For more information, visit the Newport Festivals website."
