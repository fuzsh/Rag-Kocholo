        "text": "A quick look at J B Holmes golf swing sequence and you can see where the emense power comes from:\n\nA strong solid base with the ball opposite left heel at address. Note the natural tilt of the spine away from the target ideal to launch a solid drive.\n\nA strong base helps create athletic resistance in the legs this coupled with a wide backswing and a hinge of the wrists, means a long drive.\n\nBig turn of the shoulders against strong legs no wonder the club doesn’t reach parallel to the ground, watch out ball!\n\nThe lower half of his body is unwinding towards the target pulling the club down into the downswing\n\nWOW! Any flipping of the hands here, not on your life. Just very sound impact conditions so all the energy is transfered to the ball. His whole body seems to be traveling down through the ball, no wonder he hits it so far.\n\nNotice how his toes on his left foot are off the ground this would indicate his weight is firmly into the rear of his foot and his left leg is braced and is providing a solid stable base. Due to the impact that was achieved look how long the left arm appears this is another sign of a long hitter.\n\nA fully committed finish the result a powerful swing. The nearest part of his body to the target is right shoulder, his chest aiming some 60 degrees left of the target. Notice that his hips face the target and the sole of his shoe is facing away from the target.\n\nThe key image to understand is frame 5 how the handle still leads through and just beyond impact, he’s using the whole club not just the head to strike the ball.\n\nAny would be long hitters would do well to copy this idea to their own swing and get ready for a long walk!! between tee shot and second shot.\n\nHave fun\n\nDavid"
