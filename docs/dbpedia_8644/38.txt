An Echo in the Bone[]

In September of 1777, David Rawlings is in New York, acting as a surgeon for the British army. After the battle of Bennington, he is occupied in treating various injured patients, including senior officer Brigadier General Simon Fraser.

By sheer chance, he runs into Claire Fraser, who tells him that she knows a Dr. Daniel Rawlings. He has not heard from his twin brother in years, and anxiously asks Claire about him. Claire tells David Rawlings, regretfully, that his brother Daniel is dead, and gives him a page from Daniel's medical journal. Claire also promises that to tell Dr. Rawlings the entire story, if he can get away from the British camp to speak privately.[2]

A few days later, Dr. Rawlings slips away and listens as Claire recounts the story of Daniel's accidental involvement with the Frenchman's gold and his eventual murder. He is heartbroken, but seems gratified to hear the depth of Claire's professional respect for his brother, despite never meeting him.

He and Claire discuss other medical matters and he shows Claire some of his more unusual medical tools, including a trap-like device designed to prevent nocturnal tumescence.[1]
