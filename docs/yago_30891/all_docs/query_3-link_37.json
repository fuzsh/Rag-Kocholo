        "text": "Williamsburg Home Team\n\nMeet Williamsburg Home Team\n\nRANDY & JODI HAUFE\n\nA College of William & Mary graduate, and career Army Officer, Randy founded our business in 2014. The genesis for the team, however, started over 33 years earlier when Randy and Jodi met in Williamsburg, got married, and raised a family while on a 25-year long tour with the US Army. Randy got his start in the real estate industry almost a decade ago in the highly competitive Washington DC Metro area. Known in the Army for his honesty, loyalty, teamwork, and dedication to mission accomplishment, Randy brought those same values to his Real Estate business with great success. Jodi came on board in 2019 to meet growing demand and the couple moved the business back to her hometown of Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nJodi is a Williamsburg native with an extensive knowledge of the area’s neighborhoods and the Tidewater community. An Army mom with 13 moves in 25 years under her belt, Jodi understands the difficulties of moving and strives to make your next move as seamless as possible. Her attention to detail and dedication to her clients are her hallmark.\n\nTogether, Randy and Jodi have 3 grown children. Chris is a Physicist, Catherine is a Second Grade teacher, and their youngest, Will is a Flight Instructor. Although their children have left the nest, Randy and Jodi continue to share their home with their two Australian Shepherds, Remy and Finley. In their spare time, Randy and Jodi enjoy dancing to the music of their favorite local band, “Good Shot Judy.”\n\nWhether you are looking for houses for sale, you need to sell a home, or you just want to know the answer to the question “how much is my house worth”, together, Jodi and Randy have all your real estate needs covered. Randy and Jodi truly are “Mr. and Mrs. all things Williamsburg.” They love their hometown and it shows. If you have a home to sell, there is no better team to call!\n\nReal Estate Experience\n\n2023 – Rated in the Top 10% of Producers for all of Williamsburg\n\n2015-2023 – Top Producer Every Full Year in the Business\n\nOver 56 Million in Residential Sales\n\nAll 5 Star Reviews on Zillow, Google, and Realtor.com\n\nMeet My Marketing TeamTransaction Coordinators\n\nWATCH\n\nWhat Our Clients Say About Williamsburg Home Team\n\nI had contacted several real estate agents I found online to help me sell a home I had in Virginia. After interviewing some other agents, I got in touch with Randy Haufe. I was very impressed with him after speaking with him via a phone conversation. His military service gave him a perspective on the difficulties of buying and selling a home that the other agents didn’t have… Randy took over the rehabilitation of my Virginia Home and acted as a Project Manager; something I’m not so sure other realtors would take on. He utilized contractors he had used on other homes and he followed up with them daily and was at the property at least twice a day, every day. This would be more than I would expect from most realtors, but Randy went way beyond this. I attribute this to a work ethic engrained into him through a lifetime of military service. I was never left wondering what was going on with the project and how it was progressing. He gave me updates; discussed options for things that needed to be done; and worked with me in every possible way with decisions on what, how and when to do things to complete the rehab, and when would be the best time to list the home. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention his wife and partner, Jodi. Although I didn’t deal with her directly, as a military spouse as well, it is a team effort. If you are moving from or to the Williamsburg/Newport News, Virginia area, do yourself a favor and get in touch with Randy and Jodi Haufe. It will be the best first move you will make! - Janet Koenighaus for Randy & Jodi\n\nRandy was extremely knowledgeable regarding the market, as well as being attuned to our wants and needs. He was also very patient, especially with me and our experience was absolutely wonderful. - Joseph & Mary Margaret for Randy Haufe\n\nRandy and Jodi Haufe are very good at what they do. They are easy to work with and yet, professional. They cover all the bases. And they are really nice. - Andrea for Randy & Jodi Haufe\n\nIf you want an experienced, competent and caring realtor Randy and Jodi Haufe are awesome! In the beginning when we decided to sell the house we were anxious and dreading the whole process because we live five hours away in south -western Virginia. The house needed some work like a new roof, interior painting, a deep cleaning throughout, and removal of junk in the basement and other items. Randy and Jodi took care of every detail by contacting and setting up the roof company, the painters, professional house cleaners, and the junk haulers. Because of their experience, knowledge and truly caring about our situation, the whole process from the beginning to end was stress free. It was such a joy to work with them. They went above and beyond our expectations of a realtor. I highly recommend them, they are such a wonderful team! - Sarah Hall for Randy & Jodi Haufe\n\nRead this carefully, but only if you are interested in finding an amazing and professional real estate team. If you’re in the market for a realtor, your search should end at Randy and Jodi Haufe with Shaheen, Ruth, Martin and Fonville. I could not recommended them more highly. I had the unfortunate circumstance of helping my father list his home in Williamsburg while he was living with me in Ohio during what turned out to be the last few weeks of his life. Randy and Jodi were extremely caring and compassionate through the listings agreement, assisting with preparing the property, packing up and moving (during a tropical storm) process, to coming soon marketing, listing and showing the property, and organizing and presenting offers. They were tremendous in helping me navigate the numerous obstacles that arose following my father’s passing shortly after entering into a sales contract. They absolutely went above and beyond throughout the process to ensure all the details were addressed to complete the sale on schedule all while the transactions were occurring with the seller being out of state. They anticipated potential issues and were right on top of everything with prepared options and solutions ready every step of the way. They truly were a pleasure to work with even during a very difficult circumstance. They truly are an amazing and committed team that will treat you like family. You will not regret this decision!! - J. Hooks for Randy and Jodi Haufe\n\nRandy and Jodi Haufe (Williamsburg Home Team) are the most amazing realtors ever.
