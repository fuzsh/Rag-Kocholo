Tad is portrayed by actor Michael E. Knight. Knight has portrayed the role on and off since 1982. Tad represents the good on the show All My Children, often butting heads with \"villains\" like Adam Chandler. He is perhaps the best male friend to Erica Kane. His relationship with Dixie Cooney made them a favorite of fans, reaching supercouple status.\n\nKnight has won three Daytime Emmys for his portrayal of Tad Martin. He won the Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor twice in 1986 and 1987, and won the Supporting Actor trophy in 2001. He is one of the very few actors to be nominated in younger, supporting, and lead actor categories, all while portraying the same character.\n\nAnalyzed for his impactful storylines, as well his noted charismatic personality, by various scholars, Tad is one of the more notable television characters to have ever been created.[1][2][3][4]\n\nReferences[]"
