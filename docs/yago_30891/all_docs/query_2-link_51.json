        "text": "The resurrected, revived and slightly reconfigured All My Children and One Life to Live serials will resume their story-spinning, plot-twisting and cliff-hanging on Monday, April 29, it was announced today by producer Prospect Park.\n\n“We thank the fans whose tenaciousness to see these shows return made this historical moment possible. We are determined to repay their support by delivering new and creatively groundbreaking episodes that both the fans, as well as legions of new viewers, will love,” Prospect Park partners Jeff Kwatinetz and Rich Frank said in a statement. “The response and camaraderie of our cast and crew has been inspiring as we have all banded together to succeed in our mission; unencumbered by the creative constraints of traditional broadcast television, to deliver storylines, style and characters that are stronger, with more dimension than ever. Now with our launch date set in stone, we are ready to lead this historic return. To the fans we proclaim, your support counts now more than ever.”\n\nDaytime TV icon Agnes Nixon, who will serve as a creative consultant for both programs, added: “I am so pleased that our dream of bringing these two series back to life is coming to fruition. I am grateful to Prospect Park for their unwavering commitment to this project and to the amazingly talented casts of All My Children and One Life to Live – their devotion to these franchises has made this moment possible. And to the fans – well, we wouldn’t be here without you.”\n\nAMC and OLTL will premiere new, 30-minutes episodes on weekdays via the free Hulu service and to the millions of Hulu Plus subscribers. In addition, the iTunes Store will offer both series."
