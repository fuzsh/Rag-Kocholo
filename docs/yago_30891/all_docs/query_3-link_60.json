Fisher, Anne M. Mannering, Amanda Van Scoyoc, and Alice M. Graham\n\nPlacement instability is a common occurrence among foster children and others involved with child welfare system services, and is associated with negative psychiatric and mental health outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to review and synthesize research in this area and to consider this information in terms of child welfare practice and policy. Evidence from 59 sources is reviewed, including research on (a) the connection between placement instability and poor outcomes; (b) sources of information that can be employed to reliably predict risk for placement instability; and (c) interventions designed to mitigate the effects of placement instability. The available empirical evidence suggests that placement instability and other family chaos is associated with disrupted development of the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functioning. Poor executive functioning is implicated in elevated risk for ADHD, disruptive behavior disorders, substance abuse, and other forms of disinhibitory psychopathology. This might help to explain the high rates of psychiatric medication prescriptions for foster children. Notably, however, recent research findings have shown that placement instability is both predictable and preventable and that interventions to address placement instability have the potential to mitigate neurobiological and psychiatric effects of prior adversity.\n\nYoung Children in the Child Welfare System: What Factors Contribute to Trauma Symptomology?\n\nRachel Fusco and Helen Cahalane\n\nDespite growing attention to antecedents and consequences of trauma symptoms in children, there are gaps in knowledge. Although nearly half of all children enter the child welfare system between ages 0-5, few studies have focused on the mental health of very young children. The current study examined trauma symptomology in preschool-aged children involved in the child welfare system across an entire state (n = 100). Child, maternal, and maltreatment characteristics and their relationship to child trauma symptoms were explored. Results showed that more than a quarter of children exhibited trauma symptomology. Trauma symptoms were more likely to be present when children were biracial, referred for neglect, and in homes with intimate partner violence. When mothers had their own childhood history of child welfare involvement, children were less likely to have trauma symptoms. Implications for practice with these families are discussed.\n\nThe Impact of Prevention Programs on Decisions in Child Protective Services\n\nKathryn Maguire-Jack and Kaela Byers\n\nRelying on the Decision-Making Ecology (Baumann, Dalgeish, Fluke, & Kern, 2011) model, the authors sought to gain insight into the ways in which child protective services (CPS) workers use their knowledge of maltreatment prevention programs in deciding whether to screen cases in, open cases for ongoing services, and substantiate maltreatment. During in-depth interviews with 13 CPS workers and supervisors in four Wisconsin counties, respondents reported that the programs had a direct impact on screening and case opening/closing decisions but not substantiation decisions. Substantiation decisions, rather, were impacted indirectly, as CPS staff members were able to justify a substantiation or court referral decision if families did not comply with the prevention program. This study has implications for measuring prevention program effectiveness: Given that CPS decisions may be impacted in part by prevention programs, it may be problematic to rely on official CPS records as the sole measure of maltreatment.\n\nThe Development of Child Protection Supervisors in Northern British Columbia\n\nKaren Blackman and Glen Schmidt\n\nThis mixed-methods research examined the development of supervisors in the North Region of the Ministry of Children and Family Development in the Canadian Province of British Columbia. Survey questionnaires, focus groups, and individual interviews were used to gather data from child protection social workers, supervisors, and managers in order to better understand how the organization prepares social workers to assume supervisory responsibilities and how it can improve the development of new supervisors. Training and professional development, mentoring, and acting leadership opportunities were considered to be the most important elements in developing supervision and leadership skills.\n\nParent Representation Model in Child Safety Conferences\n\nMarina Lalayants\n\nDue to limited empirical knowledge about the parent representation model in child protection, this article describes this innovative service model and explores the use of parent representatives in child safety conferences. It discusses the functions that parent representatives perform and the potential benefits of their work based on perceptions of multiple stakeholders: birthparents, parent representatives, and child protective services staff. Implications are drawn concerning the use of parent representatives in child welfare.\n\nThe Bookworm Club: The Implementation Story of an Evidence-Informed Literacy Program for Children Residing in Out-of-Home Care in Ontario\n\nEavan Brady\n\nThis paper details how the Ontario child welfare community implemented The Bookworm Club, a province-wide literacy program for children residing in out-of-home care. The province utilized a UK-based, evidence-informed practice idea and moved it into full-scale provincial implementation, which has contributed to the growth of a strong commitment to evidence-informed practice (EIP), particularly as it relates to the improvement of educational outcomes for children and youth residing in out-of-home care placements. The Bookworm Club story is noteworthy; it provides insight into the process, challenges, and opportunities involved in undertaking such an endeavor and describes how the program was moved from an idea into practice. Opportunities, successes, and challenges are detailed, along with the future goals of the program. It is hoped that this conceptual paper will inspire others involved in promoting the welfare of vulnerable children and families in implementing such evidence-informed programs.\n\nVol. 92, No. 4Pre-Placement Risk and Longitudinal Cognitive Development for Children Adopted from Foster Care\n\nJill M. Waterman, Erum Nadeem, Emilie Paczkowski, Jared Cory Foster, Justin A. Lavner, Thomas Belin, and Jeanne Miranda\n\nThis study examined the trajectory of cognitive development over the first five years of adoptive placement among children adopted from foster care and how pre-adoption risk factors relate to this development. Overall, children’s cognitive scores increased significantly, with the most rapid improvement occurring in the first year post-placement. By five years post-placement, children’s mean cognitive and achievement scores were in the average range. Adoption is a positive intervention for children’s cognitive development.\n\nChallenges to Recruit and Retain American Indian and Alaskan Natives into Social Work Programs: The Impact on the Child Welfare Workforce\n\nSuzanne L. Cross, Angelique Day, Lucas J. Gogliotti, and Justin J. Pung\n\nThere is a shortage of professionally trained American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) social workers available to provide services including child welfare services to tribal communities. This study used a mixed-model survey design to examine the perceptions of 47 AI/AN BSW and MSW students enrolled in social work programs across the United States to determine the challenges associated with recruitment and retention. The findings are supported in the literature. Findings indicate that social work academic programs have not made substantial gains in the recruitment and retention of AI/AN students over several decades. Students identified the following seven major barriers to successful recruitment and retention: (1) a lack of AI/AN professors; (2) a shortage of field placement agencies that serve AI/AN clients; (3) conflicts between students’ academic obligations and responsibilities to their families and tribal communities; (4) students’ feelings of cultural isolation; (5) the need for AI/AN role models and mentors; (6) a lack of understanding by universities of cultural customs and traditional values; and (7) racism. Implications for policy and practice are offered.\n\nAcknowledging the Past while Looking to the Future: Conceptualizing Indigenous Child Trauma\n\nShanley Swanson Nicolai and Merete Saus\n\nTrauma affects children from all ethnicities, nationalities and socioeconomic backgrounds. However, indigenous children may experience trauma differently than their majority population peers due to traumatic histories of colonization and marginalization. This article reports on an exploratory qualitative study of how service providers in Western Montana and Northern Norway conceptualize Native American and Sami children’s experiences of trauma today. Findings reveal that participants relate current trauma experiences of indigenous youth to historical and intergenerational traumas.\n\nPeer-Centered Practice: A Theoretical Framework for Intervention with Young People in and from Care\n\nKim Snow and Varda Mann-Feder\n\nThis paper puts forward a conceptual framework for engaging peers as central to transitional services for care-leavers. The situation of youth exiting care is examined and an evidence-informed approach to supporting care-leavers is presented. Exploring the social networks of youth leaving care provides a mechanism for both supporting the maintenance of ties and fostering the development of weak tie connections that facilitate opportunities for social mobility.\n\nWisconsin’s Community Response Program for Families That Have Been Reported for Child Maltreatment\n\nKathryn Maguire-Jack, Kristen S. Slack, and Lawrence M. Berger\n\nIn 2006, the Wisconsin Children’s Trust Fund launched a pilot initiative called “Community Response,” a program targeted to families reported for maltreatment but not served by child protective services due to insufficient child safety concerns. This article presents general information on the program, including the variation in models used by sites across the state, information on the families that were served by the program, and lessons learned from the experience that may guide practical decisions around the implementation of similar models elsewhere.\n\nThe Effects of the Orff Approach on Self-Expression, Self-Efficacy, and Social Skills of Children in Low-Income Families in South Korea\n\nYoung-Bae Yun and Ji-Eun Kim\n\nThis experiment was designed to study the Orff Approach–a child-centered, developmental approach to music education that aims to enrich the imagination through the acceleration of psychological activities. The study was conducted in children who had exhibited problematic behavior possibly due to economical or psychological issues; it aimed to determine whether the Orff Approach satisfies educational and treatment purposes and is an acceptable alternative in improving self-expression, self-efficacy, and social skills. The experiment involved 43 elementary school children in South Korean households with a monthly income of 100% below the average (according to the National Basic Living Security Act, South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare), and the results showed an increase of the chil-dren’s self-expression, self-efficacy, and social skills after musical activities with the Orff Approach. Also, children interacted with the musical activities–according to the Orff Approach–like a game. They noted that they were able to explain their thoughts and emotions better; their relationships with friends improved, as well. Therefore, this research is significant because it shows that musical activities according to the Orff Approach have possibilities to be utilized as a program for children’s psychological and emotional support.\n\nVol. 92, No. 3\n\nTherapeutic Mentoring: Reducing the Impact of Trauma for Foster Youth\n\nSara B. Johnson and Julia M. Pryce\n\nThis study utilized secondary data analysis to examine therapeutic mentoring (TM) as a service intervention in helping to reduce trauma symptoms in foster youth. Outcomes were compared for mentored (n = 106) and non-mentored (n = 156) foster youth related to experience and symptoms of trauma. Results showed that mentored youth improved significantly in the reduction of trauma symptoms relative to non-mentored youth, suggesting that TM shows promise as an important treatment intervention for foster youth with trauma experiences.\n\nComparison of On the Way Home Aftercare Supports to Traditional Care Following Discharge from a Residential Setting: A Pilot Randomized Control Trial\n\nAlexandra L. Trout, Matthew C. Lambert, Michael H. Epstein, Patrick Tyler, Ronald W. Thompson, McLain Stewart and Daniel L. Daly\n\nThis study compares the On the Way Home (OTWH) aftercare program to traditional aftercare supports on placement and school stability for 82 youth (43 treatment, 39 control) with disabilities discharging from residential care. One-year-post-discharge results revealed that negative event occurrence (i.e., returning to care or discontinuing enrollment in the community school) was three to over five times less likely for OTWH youth compared to youth in the control condition.\n\nQuality of Life and Mental Disorders of Adolescents Living in French Residential Group Homes\n\nGuillaume Bronsard, Christophe Lancon, Anderson Loundou, Pascal Auquier, Marcel Rufo, Sylvie Tordjman, and Marie-Claude Simeoni\n\nHere, the quality of life (QoL) of adolescents living in residential group homes (RGHs), is compared to QoL of a general adolescent population, and links between QoL and the presence of mental disorders are examined. Adolescents living in RGHs reported a significantly lower perception of their overall QoL compared to the general adolescent population. The presence of mental disorders was significantly and negatively associated with QoL scores. Some indices of QoL (physical and psychological well-being, relationship with teachers) did not show differences with the general population, indicating that mental health needs or lack of well-being are expressed in unusual ways.\n\nEvaluation of the Miami Child Well-Being Court Model: Safety, Permanency, and Well-Being Findings\n\nCecilia Casanueva, Jenifer Goldman Fraser, Adrianne Gilbert, Candice Maze, Lynne Katz, Mary Ann Ullery, Ann M. Stacks, and Cindy Lederman\n\nThis study presents preliminary outcomes for a problem-solving court improvement model, the Miami Child Well-Being Court(TM) (Miami-CWBC), which makes evidence-based clinical intervention and integration of the treating clinician’s ongoing assessment and perspective central in the dependency court process. Records were reviewed for children adjudicated for maltreatment that completed treatment. Several promising findings suggest that this approach can help jurisdictions improve the lives of young children and their families’ capacity to care for them.\n\nOrganizational Influences on Data Use among Child Welfare Workers\n\nSang Jung Lee, Charlotte Lyn Bright, and Lisa J. Berlin\n\nThis study addresses organizational factors associated with child welfare workers’ data use in their day-to-day work. Survey data from 237 respondents were analyzed using logistic regression. Familiarity with data and supervisor support were significant predictors of child welfare workers’ data use. Findings highlight the value of child welfare organizations (a) facilitating workers’ familiarity with child welfare data and data use and (b) training or educating supervisors so that they can support workers’ use of data.\n\nA Comparison of Adoptive Parents’ Perceptions of their Child’s Behavior among Indian Children Adopted to Norway, the United States, and Within Country: Implications for Adoption Policy\n\nSuzanne Brown and Victor Groza\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Protection of Children suggests that intercountry adoption be considered as a permanent care option only after other solutions within the child’s country of origin have been exhausted. Data from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were examined for 478 Indian children ages 4-18 adopted domestically, adopted to Norway, and adopted to the United States. The CBCL has a reported reliability of .9 (Achenbach, 1991; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983) and contains five subscales assessing internalizing problems plus a summative Internalizing Scale, and three subscales assessing externalizing problems plus a summative Externalizing Scale. Perceptions of Norwegian, American, and Indian adoptive parents regarding their child’s functioning were compared. Children adopted to Norway and the United States were perceived by their parents to be functioning significantly better behaviorally than children adopted within country, while controlling for age of child and gender of adoptive parent completing the CBCL. Policymakers should examine the evidence prioritizing within country adoption over intercountry adoption.\n\nVol. 92, No. 2\n\nThe Public Health Approach for Understanding and Preventing Child Maltreatment: A Brief Review of the Literature and a Call to Action\n\nTheresa Covington\n\nOver the past 50 years, most major advances in child maltreatment have focused on protecting severely maltreated children and punishing perpetrators. This article argues that it is time to rigorously apply a public health framework to improve our understanding of, and accelerate efforts to, prevent child abuse and neglect. The article describes the fundamentals of a public health approach; discusses how this approach has been applied to improve surveillance of serious maltreatment injuries and fatalities, the understanding of risk and protective factors, and the long-term consequences of maltreatment; and describes how a public health approach is an effective means to prevention.\n\nExtent and Nature of Child Maltreatment-Related Fatalities: Implications for Policy and Practice\n\nJennifer Sheldon-Sherman, Dee Wilson, and Susan Smith\n\nThis article reviews significant research findings regarding child maltreatment fatalities over the last thirty years. Notably, the article focuses on several important subsets of children who die from maltreatment, including young children, children reported to child protective services, and children who live in families with poor parental attachment, mental illness, substance abuse, and domestic violence. The article then sets forth three proposals for broadening the United States’ approach to child protection and reducing child maltreatment fatalities.\n\nPreventing Severe and Fatal Child Maltreatment: Making the Case for the Expanded Use and Integration of Data\n\nEmily Putnam-Hornstein, Joanne N. Wood, John Fluke, Amanda Yoshioka-Maxwell, and Rachel P. Berger\n\nIn this article we examine risk factors for severe and fatal child maltreatment. These factors emerge from studies based on different data sources, including official child maltreatment data, emergency department and hospitalization data, death certificates, and data from child death review teams. The empirical literature reflects a growing effort to overcome the measurement uncertainties of any one individual data system. After review and reflection upon what is known, we consider how integrating this information can advance efforts to protect children, providing examples where the use and linkage of multiple sources of data may enhance surveillance, improve front-end decisionmaking, and support cost-effective research and evaluation.\n\nAdvancing Public Health Surveillance to Estimate Child Maltreatment Fatalities: Review and Recommendations\n\nPatricia G. Schnitzer, Sam P. Gulino, Ying-Ying T. Yuan\n\nFatal child maltreatment is a compelling problem in the United States. National estimates of fatal child maltreatment, based largely on child welfare data, have fluctuated around 1,500 deaths annually for the past ten years. However, the limitations of child welfare and other mortality data to accurately enumerate fatal child maltreatment are well documented. As a result of these limitations, the true magnitude of fatal child maltreatment remains unknown. Public health surveillance has been proposed as a mechanism to improve estimation of fatal child maltreatment, as well as to collect and analyze relevant risk factor data for the ultimate goal of developing prevention strategies. This paper describes public health surveillance efforts undertaken to improve estimation of fatal child maltreatment, and presents the unique challenges of identifying fatal child neglect. The strengths and limitations of existing sources of child maltreatment fatality data are reviewed and broad recommendations for strategies to advance public health surveillance of fatal child maltreatment are presented.\n\nApplying a Public Health Approach: The Role of State Health Departments in Preventing Maltreatment and Fatalities of Children\n\nMalia Richmond-Crum, Catherine Joyner, Sally Fogerty, Mei Ling Ellis, and Janet Saul\n\nChild maltreatment prevention is traditionally conceptualized as a social services and criminal justice issue. Although these responses are critical and important, alone they are insufficient to prevent the problem. A public health approach is essential to realizing the prevention of child abuse and neglect. This paper discusses the public health model and social-ecology framework as ways to understand and address child maltreatment prevention and discusses the critical role health departments can have in preventing abuse and neglect. Information from an environmental scan of state public health departments is provided to increase understanding of the context in which state public health departments operate. Finally, an example from North Carolina provides a practical look at one state’s effort to create a cross-sector system of prevention that promotes safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments for children and families.\n\nEffective Primary Prevention Programs in Public Health and their Applicability to the Prevention of Child Maltreatment\n\nFrederick P. Rivara and Brian Johnston\n\nPrinciples of public health practice can be applied to problems, such as child maltreatment, that have behavioral antecedents and injury outcomes. Successful campaigns to promote bicycle helmet use to prevent brain injury and to promote supine sleeping to prevent sudden infant death are described. These programs were universally applied, featured simple behavioral goals, were based on the best available evidence, and monitored both behavioral and health-related outcomes.\n\nSafety and Risk Assessment Frameworks: Overview and Implications for Child Maltreatment Fatalities\n\nPeter J. Pecora, Zeinab Chahine, and J. Christopher Graham\n\nThis article highlights current models used in child protection to assess safety and risk, and discusses implications for child maltreatment fatalities. The authors advance that current risk and safety practice approaches were not designed to accurately estimate the likelihood of low base-rate phenomena and have not been empirically tested in their ability to predict or prevent severe or fatal child maltreatment. They advance that, regardless of the ultimate effectiveness of safety and risk tools, competent assessment and decisionmaking in child protection depend on sound professional judgment and a comprehensive systemic approach that transcends the use of specific tools.\n\nInnovative Cross-System and Community Approaches for the Prevention of Child Maltreatment\n\nPaul DiLorenzo, Catherine Roller White, Alex Morales, Andrea Paul, and Suma Shaw\n\nBecause of the complexity and depth of problems facing children and families today, child protection can be best accomplished through a community effort–not simply through the efforts of the traditional child welfare system and other child- and family-serving agencies. Community-based initiatives supporting families and individuals are promising mechanisms through which to efficiently reach a wide range of community members consistent with a public health model. This conceptual paper describes the principles of community-based approaches for the prevention of child maltreatment and briefly describes four initiatives that are providing comprehensive, community-based prevention.\n\nApplying Principles from Safety Science to Improve Child Protection\n\nMichael J. Cull, Tina L. Rzepnicki, Kathryn O’Day, and Richard A. Epstein\n\nChild Protective Services Agencies (CPSAs) share many characteristics with other organizations operating in high-risk, high-profile industries. Over the past 50 years, industries as diverse as aviation, nuclear power, and healthcare have applied principles from safety science to improve practice. The current paper describes the rationale, characteristics, and challenges of applying concepts from the safety culture literature to CPSAs. Preliminary efforts to apply key principles aimed at improving child safety and well-being in two states are also presented.\n\nSoft is Hardest: Leading for Learning in Child Protection Services Following a Child Fatality\n\nAndrew Turnell, Eileen Munro, and Terry Murphy\n\nThe way in which a child protection agency responds to a child fatality always has a strong influence on subsequent practice. Very often, organizational responses and child death reviews are punitive and escalate an already anxious and defensive organizational culture. This paper outlines an alternative approach that not only helps staff to manage their emotional responses but also encourages and prioritizes a learning culture within the organization throughout the crisis and in the longer term.\n\nEffective Communications Strategies: Engaging the Media, Policymakers, and the Public\n\nAllison Blake, Kathy Bonk, Daniel Heimpel, and Cathy S. Wright\n\nToo often, strategic communication is too little, or comes too late, when involved with a child fatality or serious injury. This article explores the challenges arising from negative publicity around child safety issues and the opportunities for communications strategies that employ a proactive public health approach to engaging media, policymakers, and the public. The authors provide a case study and review methods by which child welfare agencies across the nation are building public engagement and support for improved outcomes in child safety while protecting legitimate confidentiality requirements. Finally, the piece articulates the rationale for agency investments in the resources necessary to develop and implement an effective communications plan.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Comprehensive and Innovative Approaches for Improving Safety and Preventing Child Maltreatment Fatalities\n\nZeinab Chahine and David Sanders\n\nThis article presents a high-level overview of the complex issues, opportunities, and challenges involved in improving child safety and preventing child maltreatment fatalities. It emphasizes that improving measurement and classification is critical to understanding and preventing child maltreatment fatalities. It also stresses the need to reframe child maltreatment interventions from a public health perspective. The article draws on the lessons learned from state-of-the-art safety engineering innovations, research, and other expert recommendations presented in this special issue that can inform future policy and practice direction in this important area.\n\nVol. 92, No. 1\n\nWhat Child Welfare Staff Say about Organizational Culture\n\nRobin Spath, Virginia C. Strand, and Stephanie Bosco-Ruggiero\n\nThis article examines the factors that can affect job satisfaction, organizational culture and climate, and intent to leave at a public child welfare agency. Findings from focus group data collected from direct line, middle, and senior managers revealed a passive defensive culture. The authors discuss concrete organizational interventions to assist the agency in shifting to a constructive oriented culture through enhancements in communication, including supervision and shared decisionmaking, recognition and rewards, and improvement in other areas related to working conditions.\n\nPromoting Cross-Sector Partnerships in Child Welfare: Qualitative Results from a Five-State Strategic Planning Process\n\nCrystal Collins-Camargo, Mary I. Armstrong, Bowen McBeath, and Emmeline Chuang\n\nLittle is known about effective strategic planning for public and private child welfare agencies working together to serve families. During a professionally facilitated, strategic planning event, public and private child welfare administrators from five states explored partnership challenges and strengths with a goal of improving collaborative interactions in order to improve outcomes for children and families. Summarizing thematic results of session notes from the planning event, this article describes effective strategies for facilitation of such processes as well as factors that challenge or promote group processes. Implications for conducting strategic planning in jurisdictions seeking to improve public/private partnerships are discussed.\n\nA Profile of Post-ASFA Hearings in the U.S. Congress\n\nHeather R. Edwards\n\nExamination of the policymaking process can yield a better understanding of the rationale behind policy content and prescriptions for shaping future policies. To this end, this study uses data from 38 child welfare hearings held by the U.S. Congress from 1999-2010 to describe key hearings, as well as Congress, committee member, and child welfare indicators. This manuscript concludes with implications for research and practice.\n\nSubstantiation Assessment Criteria: A Framework for Evaluating Contested Substantiation in Child Protection Practice\n\nSunday Fakunmoju\n\nThis article presents substantiation assessment criteria as an evidentiary framework for evaluating contested substantiation of child maltreatment in child protection practice. To accomplish this purpose, the article discusses contested substantiation and judicial outcomes in contested cases as a means of underscoring the criteria’s evidentiary relevance. The article presents conceptually and empirically driven substantiation assessment criteria and highlights their relevance for guiding substantiation decisions, evidentiary hearings, and future research in contested substantiation of child maltreatment.\n\nChild Custody Disputes within the Context of Child Protection Investigations: Secondary Analysis of the Canadian Incident Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect\n\nMichael A. Saini, Tara Black, Barbara Fallon, and Alena Marshall\n\nWorking with parents and children caught in child custody disputes after or during separation and divorce can be challenging for professionals when they lack a clear understanding of the unique circumstances of these disputes. To address this gap, this study reports on national data about child custody disputes within the context of child protection investigations by using secondary analysis of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS-2003). A descriptive profile of custody cases compared to non-custody cases is important to begin informing the field about the unique characteristics of families involved in both family law and child protection proceedings. The sample includes child maltreatment investigations as children came into contact with child protection services over a three-month sampling period. Based on the 11,562 child maltreatment investigations, 12% involved a child custody dispute. Child custody dispute files were more likely to be opened more than three times and they had higher rates of malicious referrals, compared to non-custody child protection files. Twenty percent of investigations involving a child custody dispute were for children’s exposure to domestic violence, followed by physical abuse, emotional harm and neglect. Children involved in custody disputes were reported to have higher proportion of emotional harm and more functioning issues compared to children not caught in their parents’ custody disputes. Parental alcohol abuse was also significantly higher in child custody cases. Implications for child protection systems are explored. Suggestions are made to improve child protection procedures for the earlier detection of child custody cases and for the enhancement of specialized knowledge for workers to effectively intervene and protect children from the negative consequences of adult conflict after separation and divorce.\n\nParenting in Recovery Program: Participant Responses and Case Examples\n\nSanna Thompson, Chuck Roper, and Laura Peveto\n\nApproximately 80% of children served by child welfare agencies have parents who abuse or are dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs. Despite the devastating effects on children from living in substance abusing families, child protective service practitioners have limited options available to assist these families. The Parenting in Recovery program was created to address the needs of substance-abusing mothers involved in child welfare. This manuscript describes this program and perceptions of participants concerning its effectiveness.\n\nThe Environment as a Cause of Disease in Children”: Josef Friedjung’s Transnational Influence on Modern Child Welfare Theory\n\nElizabeth Ann Danto\n\nJosef K. Friedjung’s Advanced Pediatrics–A Companion to Traditional Textbooks (Erlebte Kinderheilkunde–eine Ergaenzung er gebraeu-chlichen Lehrbucher), published in 1919 in Vienna, has cast a long but nearly-vanished shadow over modern child welfare theory. The originality of his focus on “the whole child” was in some ways a commentary on Sigmund Freud, but its overtly progressive political character gave Friedjung’s argument visible applicability within the field of urban social welfare. As a pediatrician and an ardent cosmopolitan, Friedjung was willing to consider conflicting values between traditional family systems and the state. Had the Nazis not forced him into exile in Palestine, where he died in 1946, Friedjung’s pioneering oeuvre would have joined our child welfare narrative long ago. Fortunately today archival evidence on which this study draws, fragmented as it is in both German and English, does confirm that the first and second generation psychoanalysts, Friedjung among them, built a mental health movement around a social justice core closely allied to the cultural context of central Europe from 1918 to 1933. In many ways, child welfare as we know it emerged as a practical implementation of that ideology.\n\nVol. 91, No. 6\n\nParent Engagement in Child Safety Conferences: The Role of Parent Representatives\n\nMarina Lalayants\n\nParent engagement is a critical and challenging task of child welfare, and meaningful parent engagement in a dialogue, service planning, and acceptance of services is even more challenging in the context of non-voluntary child protection. This study described and examined the parent representation model that made use of parent representatives in engaging birthparents during child safety conferences in child protection. The findings identified the barriers to parental engagement and determined factors promoting engagement. Implications of this model are discussed.\n\nEngaging Families in the Child Welfare Process Ut"
