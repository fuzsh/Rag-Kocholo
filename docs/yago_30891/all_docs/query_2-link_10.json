        "text": "Is it too soap operatic to say that an era in TV history is coming to an end today at high noon?\n\nThat’s when the last episode of the long running daytime drama “All My Children” will air on network TV. ABC announced in April that it was canceling the show after 41 years of all sorts of standard soap opera melodrama and quite a few landmark moments.\n\nTrue to the nature of its genre, “All My Children” is expected to come back to life next year – on the Internet. Which of the actors will migrate to the online version and whether it will be a success remains to be seen. Contracts are still being negotiated with Prospect Park, the company that plans to produce the show online.\n\nWord is that Susan Lucci, who emerged as the show’s iconic character in Erica Kane and has been a fixture from start to finish in the fictional town of Pine Valley, won’t be going online with “All My Children.”\n\nSome fans say they won’t watch the show after it leaves the air. Others say they will continue, even if it won’t be the same.\n\nEnrique Buenrostro, a 20-year-old college student who lives in Tustin, says he’ll stick with “All My Children” even if he is unhappy about how ABC has handled his favorite soap opera. It’s too much a part of his life to give up: His mother was a fan and he remembers seeing it on the TV at home since he was about 3.\n\nBuenrostro didn’t understand the plot lines when he was a toddler,, but he began watching with earnest about 10 years ago. He loves the storylines, the characters, the interaction.\n\n“It is so outrageous but it keeps you so wanting to watch more,” he says. “The more outrageous it got the more you want to see it.”\n\nSee a slide show that looks at both the outrageous and the profound that helped make “All My Children” such a success."
