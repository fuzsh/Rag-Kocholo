        "text": "In the early days of All My Children, Joe Martin had a younger son named Bobby, who was nothing much like his older siblings, Jeff and Tara.\n\nUnfortunately, little Bobby would seem to become daytime’s answer to Chuck Cunningham.\n\nOne day, he went upstairs to the attic to get his skis. And the next thing you know, he was never to be heard from again.\n\nSo can anyone tell me where in the world is Bobby Martin? 8)\n\nAMC’s Bobby Martin (Michael Bersell) has been a symbol of soap opera silliness ever since the twelve-year-old son of Dr. Joe Martin went upstairs in 1970 and never came back down. It may be the single most gratuitous and ridiculous write-out in all of soap opera history.\n\nn the eve of AMC’s last network airdate, the Orlando Sentinal has located Michael, and he’s all grown up, of course. He’s not acting anymore He changed careers and now works, like Mario Batali, as a professional chef. For Disney.\n\nAllegedly Bobby Martin went upstairs to get his ski’s to take to summer camp. So they were most likely Water Skis. Why the moronic writers thought no one would notice is beyond me. Same with the people at ‘Happy Days’ with Chuck And the worst offender are the idiots at ‘Family Matters’ where they suddenly dumped the Character Judy after 3 SEASONS ON THE SHOW! What kind of idiots do that?\n\nI guess they just figured no one pays any attention to details like that. they guessed wrong. lol"
