        "text": "Aug. 9\n\n1916 The Philadelphia A's ended their 20-game losing streak as Joe Bush beat the Detroit Tigers 7-1.\n\n1939 Red Rolfe of the New York Yankees started a streak of 18 consecutive games in which he scored at least one run. During those games, he scored a total of 30 runs.\n\n1960 Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox hit home run No. 511 to tie Mel Ott for fourth place on the all-time list.\n\n1975 Davey Lopes of the Los Angeles Dodgers stole his 32nd consecutive base without being caught in a 2-0 victory over the New York Mets, breaking Max Carey's 1922 record. Lopes tacked on six more steals before being caught on Aug. 24.\n\n1976 John Candelaria became the first Pirates pitcher in 69 years to throw a no-hitter in Pittsburgh by blanking the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-0. Candelaria's no-hitter came at Three Rivers Stadium. No Pirates player ever threw a no-hitter at Forbes Field.\n\n1981 Baseball returned following the strike with the All-Star Game in Cleveland before a crowd of 72,086. Gary Carter of the Montreal Expos hit two home runs to give the National League a 5-4 victory over the American League. Vida Blue became the first pitcher to win an All-Star Game in both leagues. His AL victory came in 1971 at Detroit.\n\n1988 The Chicago Cubs won the first official night game at Wrigley Field by beating the New York Mets 6-4.\n\n1998 Dennis Martinez became the winningest Latin pitcher in baseball history, breaking Juan Marichal's record of 243 victories. Martinez pitched a perfect eighth inning and got the victory when Chipper Jones hit a tiebreaking, two-run single in the ninth inning and the Atlanta Braves held on for the win.\n\n2001 Mike Hampton tied the NL record for pitchers with his seventh home run as the Colorado Rockies beat the Cubs 14-5. Hampton's seventh home run matched the NL mark shared by Don Drysdale (1958, 1965) and Don Newcombe (1955). The major league record is nine by Cleveland's Wes Ferrell in 1931.\n\n2002 Barry Bonds hit his 600th home run, becoming the fourth major leaguer to reach the mark. With a 421-foot, solo shot off Pittsburgh's Kip Wells, the San Francisco Giants slugger joined Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays in the exclusive club.\n\n2007 Failed pitcher Rick Ankiel hit a three-run home run to cap his debut as a major league outfielder in St. Louis' 5-0 victory over San Diego.\n\n2018 Mookie Betts hit a home run for Boston in the ninth inning to complete his first career cycle, and Toronto held on to beat the Red Sox 8-5.\n\n-- The Associated Press"
