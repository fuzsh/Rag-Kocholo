Carol was born August 13, 1940, to Sylvia Steinmetz Mueller and Willard Gray Mueller in Chippewa Falls, WI. In 1962, she met and, three months later, married David Miles Duffin, a large animal veterinarian; they enjoyed nearly thirty years of marriage prior to Dave’s passing in 1992. She is survived by her daughters, all of Sturgeon Bay, WI: Laurel (John) Hauser, Tracy (John) Vreeke, and Jacinda Duffin; and honorary son, Vince (Heidi) Jirik of Green Bay; as well as her sisters-in-law, Carol Mueller, Dorothy Duffin Saylor, and Bonnie Duffin. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Sylvia Hauser, Thomas Hauser (partner Cara Reisen), and Isabel Vreeke (fiancée, Kalea Bicoy); as well as many nieces and nephews. In addition to her husband, she was preceded in death by her parents; and two siblings, Marion Mueller Boehm and Keith Mueller; niece, Jodyne Reiten; and numerous in-laws. Carol enjoyed a childhood surrounded by cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. She and her friends had free range of all small-town Chippewa Falls had to offer – biking to the A & W, swimming at Lake Wissota, and exploring Irvine Park. Her first job was at the Chippewa Falls Welcome Center, fitting for a woman who spent a lifetime welcoming people of all ages into her home. Her small-town roots never left her, and many early friends remained friends for life. An enthusiastic and well-rounded student, Carol was chosen to attend Badger Girls State in Madison, WI, before graduating from Chippewa Falls High School in 1958. She continued her studies at UW-Stout, earning a teaching degree in Home Economics and started her teaching career in Bloomer, WI. As a married couple, Carol and Dave first lived in Colfax, WI, where they started a family, forged deep friendships, and enjoyed the antics and camaraderie of a town of 800. They later moved to West De Pere, WI, where Carol taught high school for more than 30 years. She was a natural teacher, beloved by students and colleagues alike. Mrs. Duffin’s door was always open; she was the teacher who had a dollar if you left your lunch money at home and time to talk if you were carrying a heavy load. She received numerous awards for her professionalism and leadership over her teaching career, but what made her happiest were phone calls from former students, even decades after her retirement, sharing how she had impacted their lives. Carol saw herself as part of a bigger community, modeling the importance of public service and political involvement all her life. She was a founding member of the first nursery school program in De Pere, was an active Girl Scout leader, and served on the Parents Council at Carroll University, her daughters’ alma mater. She and her husband were involved locally as school board members, volunteers, and active members at the First United Presbyterian Church of De Pere. In 2001, Carol moved to Sturgeon Bay where she made quick friends and forged close relationships with her Utah Street neighbors. Most importantly, she was a daily presence for her family and the grandchildren she adored. Carol was fun to be around, kind beyond measure, and her practicality guided her positive outlook. She saw the best in people and had a remarkable capacity for understanding and acceptance. She appreciated that there are many ways to do things in life, unless you were talking about getting cupcakes to rise or properly leveling a cup of flour; some things can only be done one way. She will be greatly missed. The family wishes to thank Linda Streyle for her care, attention and friendship in Carol’s final months. A celebration of life will be held at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, August 15, 2024, at Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church, 323 S. 5th Ave., followed by a reception in the church fellowship hall. A visitation prior to the celebration of life service will be held from 2:00 – 3:30 p.m. at the church.

She was born November 22, 1934, in Chicago, IL, the daughter of Myron and Majel (Olson) Kruse. Myra graduated from Marinette High School with the class of 1952 before attending Madison, majoring in Speech. After her children were older, she attended UWGB majoring in Art. On June 15, 1954, Myra married Thomas S. Pinney, Jr. at Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church. Myra worked at the Nursery in micro-propagation. She was a stay home mom keeping order for the family meals, cleaning and sewing for everyone as they needed. Myra and Tom were blessed with three children, Majel, Cheryl and Geoff. It was not too often that meals were only for the five of them. Quite often, extra children who needed a good meal, or business associates of the nursery and academia friends were at the table. Myra was a voracious reader who loved words and paper. She knitted and crocheted, and did needlework, sewing beautifully without a pattern many times. Myra was a great cook and enjoyed making guests welcome. She was a member of the Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church. Myra was an active member of both, the Honor Chapter #1 Order of the Eastern Star and Daughters of the Nile. Myra and Tom were devoted youth mentors. She served as Guardian of Job’s Daughters for over a decade. For 27 years, she held various positions including Girls Head Counselor at the Moravian Church Camp for High School and College age youth. Giving of her personal life and time, along with her husband Tom, led to becoming a surrogate mother to hundreds of teenagers and adults who needed guidance, a shoulder to cry on or a good meal. Myra took care of the “lost sheep”, the children who needed a space and a meal when times were tough for them. She will be missed by her husband, Tom, with whom she shared over 70 years of marriage with; two children, Cheryl Pinney Leu of Mishicot and Geoffrey (Sonja) Pinney of Green Bay; son-in-law, Philip Henrickson of Mishicot; granddaughter, Nikki Stark (Kevin) DeGuelle; two great-grandchildren, Maxwell Thomas DeGuelle and Isabelle Majel DeGuelle; and her brother, Monty (Sandra) Kruse of Fort Worth, TX.

She was born May 4, 1946, in Sheboygan, WI to Charles and Margaret (Schnorr) Street. Carole loved learning. She graduated from University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh with BA in Education and enjoyed teaching middle school English and Geography for over 30 years in Sheboygan Falls Middle School. After retirement, Carole moved full time to Gills Rock, Door County continuing her second career as a Simply Scandinavian gift shop owner and being part of many local organizations such as Liberty Grove Historical Society. Carole will be remembered most by her heart of gold and her skillful art of making friends. Her genuine interest in getting to know people, remembering their life stories and caring for everyone’s well being made her a master of creating beautiful life long lasting friendships. She held her friends, near and far, close to her heart. Some of Carole’s best memories were made around various dining room tables playing card games or mahjong with her dear Door County friends and family. She also enjoyed her social gatherings in various Door County restaurants. Carole took great pleasure in traveling the world with her favorite sister Mary. The two shared the passion of seeing new places, experiencing new cultures and enjoying various local cuisines. Carole also always looked forward to her brother Richard’s daily phone calls to check in on her. Gills Rock sunsets, Yorkie puppies, birds, daisies and sunflowers, handmade delicate doilies, a glass of Zinfandel, green for emerald, word puzzles and her life-long passion of collecting delicate fans were a few of her favorite things that will forever remind us of her. But most of all, Carole loved her nephew Dan. The love and respect the two had for each other was heartwarming and comforting to both. The special bond was created in Dan’s early childhood by their mutual love for Grandpa Charlie and time spent together in Gills Rock. Carole was to Dan the second mother not many are lucky to have in this world. And Dan was Carole’s everything. Carole is survived by brother Richard Street, Sheboygan, WI; nephews, Dan (Gretel) Schwarz of Gills Rock, WI, David (Yu) Schwarz of Sturgeon Bay, WI, Bill Street of Sheboygan, WI and nieces, Julie (George) Street of Oshkosh, WI, Nancy (Lou) Henschel of Cedarburg, WI, Jeane (Jim) Endsley of Green Bay, WI, Cindy (Jim) Krimmel of Oshkosh, WI; great nieces and great nephews.

I was preceded in death by my parents, who lived to the ripe old age of 98 and 102, by my brother-in-law, Robert Owens, and my mother-in-law, Esther B. Sheehy. I died at home in Baileys Harbor, WI. After a friend asked me recently about my life, I began reflecting on what a rich life I have had, full of surprises, twists and turns. Several things stick out as life changing events. First, I grew up in the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ, from the time I was a baby. That gave me not only my faith foundation but provided me with space for much questioning and reflection. I spent many years attending Madison Ave. Christian Church in Covington, KY, and loved and cherished my many close friends there. From the time I was born until the 8th grade, our family moved 12 times in 12 years, many moves due to life’s unplanned circumstances. Those different experiences, with different people, different ways of life, different schools turned out to be invaluable in my growth and maturity. It made me adaptable and resilient. I learned to make friends quickly, and even though I might be the odd person out, I could survive and learn from the experience. In the 1950’s, our family settled in Northern KY where I attended Dixie Heights High School, Edgewood KY, University of Cincinnati, where I studied Interior Design, and the University of Kentucky, where I studied Fine Arts. After college, I worked in various interior design studios in Kentucky and Cincinnati. In 1969, a camping trip across country from the Apollo 11 moon shot in Cape Canaveral to an adventurous trip up the Alcan Highway, ended in Anchorage, Alaska. With a broken down car and no money, it prompted a stay. Anchorage had experienced a devastating earthquake shortly before my arrival and the town had no need for Interior Designers. As luck would have it, I was eventually able to get a job with the Anchorage Daily News. By a twist of fate, I was asked to become one of their photojournalist. With little previous photographic experience, I suddenly became a photographer and continued as a freelance photographer journalist for numerous years after leaving Anchorage. I continued to love photography long after I wasn’t doing it professionally. It was another one of those gifts you get in life when you aren’t expecting it. I learned you have to accept the challenge and enjoy it. In late 1977, after moving back to Northern Kentucky, I opened an Interior Design studio in downtown Covington, KY. I practiced there for over 23 years. Again, I had no experience or knowledge of running a business, but with the help and support of many close associates and incredible repeating clients, we were able to make it happen. We all worked hard (and laughed a lot) to make it a success. This was another gift that was dropped in my lap when I wasn’t expecting it. The best piece of advice I got was, “What do you have to lose? You can always close if it doesn’t work out.” We never had to do that. On October 31, 1985, I married my wonderful architect husband, and partner in life, Daniel Robert Sheehy. We were married in Door County, WI on a beautiful rock outcrop on the shores of Lake Michigan. In 1995, Dan joined the business, and we became an Architecture and Interior Design firm. We moved our business from Covington, KY to Ft. Thomas, KY in 2000 and practiced there for another 17 years before completely retiring in 2017. Dan and I pursued our passion of designing, building, and renovating. Starting with a spur of the moment decision to purchase an untamed piece of property, in beautiful Baileys Harbor. We molded it into a place that we have loved for 38 years. It is our place of joy and peace. Several years later, we purchased and renovated a small home in Bokeelia, Florida, on Pine Island, FL. It was another adventure and something we loved doing. We designed, built, renovated and maintained throughout our time together. Both were gifts we were not expecting, but it has brought us joy for many years. I was a homebody and an avid daydreamer. I loved sitting on our back deck staring into the woods, watching the birds flutter and the butterflies flitter. I loved painting, and it became an important part of my life. I loved all the delicious meals with neighbors and friends sipping wine, laughing and telling use-to stories about all the things we use-to be able to do. It has been a contented life. Dan and I have been so lucky to have many incredible and full of love friends and family in our lives. They surrounded us with comfort, support and so much kindness. Just know that we love you very much and you have made our lives, and this life transition, a happy and peaceful one for both of us. We will never be able to thank you enough for your compassion and caring. I leave behind my wonderful, caring husband, Dan Sheehy, my very beloved siblings, Dexter Meyer, III, Nancy (Steve) Kingsley, Joellen Owens (Dennis Helton), my vivacious sister-in-law, Lisa (Jim) Firlan, my cherished nieces and nephews, to whom I am known as Crazy Aunt Linda, Cadie (Brennan) Sweeney, Kyle (Josh) Warning, Carrie (Tim) Powers, Sarah Kingsley, and the beautiful, incredible, smart great-nieces and nephews, Mason and Brooklin Sweeney, Kendal and Claire Powers, and Salvatore Nassano. As a final reflection, I am reminded that the ultimate goal is to celebrate life every day and to cherish every one who comes into your life. Embrace those opportunities that fall in your lap and run with them. The rewards will be exciting and often unexpected. And remember to smile and laugh. It will certainly brighten your every day. A special thanks to the wonderful folks on the hospice team at Unity Hospice. They were with us every step of the way to guide us through this process. To Dr. Josh Rebhan, Dr. Daniel Hanley and Dr. Faith Gardner for all their care and guidance. Also, to Huehns Funeral Home who were so kind and helpful in making our final plans.

Ralph was born on August 23, 1929, in Algoma to the late Ralph and Sarah (Challe) Vlies. Ralph was raised in Algoma, went to St. Mary Catholic Grade School, and graduated from the Algoma High School in 1949. Ralph worked at Katch's Department Store in Algoma after graduation for one year. On January 4, 1951, Ralph proudly served in the US Army. He was stationed over in Germany during the Korean War. His duties included building and tearing down bridges across the Rhine River. He was very proud of his service to his country and his service will be forever in his heart. He was honorably discharged on December 31, 1952, and served in the Army Reserves from January 1, 1953, to April 1, 1957. He had the rank of Corporal while in the Army. Ralph also was a part of the Algoma Civil Defense for many years. After his service to his country, he met the love of his life, Betty Ann Picha, from Kewaunee. Ralph dated her for a few years going to many polka dances in the area. They got married at St. Mary Church on July 2, 1955. They honeymooned in Colorado. He worked at the Algoma Plywood (Algoma Hardwoods) for 40 and a half years. While there he was president of the Union 1521 for many years. He was also President of the AFLCIO for many years. Ralph loved riding his moped through Algoma and talking with friends that he would meet along the way. He loved his sports teams, including the Packers, Brewers, and Badgers. His famous saying during the games was \"bunch of bums\". He also enjoyed playing in the Algoma Slow Pitch league for Bergers for many years. Ralph was always there for his children and grandchildren throughout his life. Ralph was a very Christian man and was devoted to his church, by Ushering for many years. After his retirement he went on to be the playground supervisor for St. Mary School for 10 years. After he left this last job of his life, Children from St. Mary would come up to him and tell stories of him playing with them on the playground, those 10 years. That kept him much younger in his heart than his age would show. Ralph is survived by his three children, Dennis (Sandra), Terry (Jill) and Lori Lischka; grandchildren, Amanda (Chad) Thiry, Joshua (Erin) McGinus, Alex (Margaret) Vlies, Samantha Vlies, Nicholas Lischka (fiancé Katie) and Ashley Lischka (fiancé Paul); great-grandchildren, Bryce, Olivia, Morgan, Evan, Brittney and Macey.

Aurelius\n\nDavid Aurelius, 73, of Ellison Bay passed away peacefully Monday, July 22, 2024, after a valiant, 10-year battle with Parkinson’s Disease. David grew up in St. Paul, MN, the youngest child of Paul and Marjorie Aurelius. He spent his childhood as a Boy Scout, going to YMCA Camp St. Croix, camping in the summer with his family, spending time with his cousins on the lake and finding mischief of one kind or another. His artistic interests started at a young age; proudly supported by his parents. While attending University High School in Minneapolis, MN, he realized he wanted to become a potter. After graduating “U” High in 1968, he went on to study at the University of Minnesota and after that furthered his education in art and ceramics at Luther College in Decorah, IA. For five summers, David studied pottery at Pond Farm in Guerneville, CA, under the direction of Bauhaus-trained, Marguerite Wildenhain. He met the love of his life, Jeanne Svien, at Luther College in the fall of 1970. They “got married in a fever” in Decorah, IA, on June 3, 1972, and have been inseparable ever since. A lifelong learner and artist, David worked as a professional potter alongside his partner in love and life, Jeanne. From 1974 – 1976, they owned Washington Prairie Pottery in Decorah, IA, where their studio was a remodeled chicken coop. In February of 1976, they decided to make Door County their home and moved to Ellison Bay, establishing Clay Bay Pottery. There, they created a life together that was built on the love of pursuing their dreams and each other. David was best known for his beautiful, classical forms, abstract designs and using birds and nature as his inspiration. For 48 years, David and Jeanne ran a successful business and impacted their community with their ability to add beauty in everyone's lives – from large tile murals in schools to the smallest coffee mugs in peoples’ homes. David was a devoted father to Lauren Marie and Martha Lenore. From road trips to international adventures, he loved traveling with his family. David was always there with endless love and support for whatever dream they set out to achieve. As a grandfather to Marjorie and Leon, David shared his love of sweet treats and was given the name “Grandpa Cookie”. His tender-loving care was always present in their lives. A champion of the arts, David mentored many students to pursue their own artistic talents. He served as a board member for the Door County Chamber of Commerce, the Door County Potters’ Guild, Peninsula School of Art and was a devoted volunteer at the Door Community Auditorium. His contributions to the Door County community and beyond have made a significant impact on us all. David was a pun-loving, history buff and never turned down a dance with Jeanne. When working in their studio, music was ever-present from Bob Dylan to Shawn Colvin. On his days off, you could find him riding his bike or cross-country skiing through Peninsula State Park, sailing the waters of Green Bay and Lake Michigan, swimming at Europe Bay, voraciously reading mysteries and always the Sunday New York Times, planting trees and gardening or cheering on his local baseball team, the Sister Bay Bays. He is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Jeanne; daughters, Lauren Aurelius (Fred Wahlen), Martha (Adam) Hutchinson; grandson, Leon; sister, Ann Aurelius; brother, John (Maureen) Aurelius; brothers-in-law, John Svien and Bill (LeAnne DeTrana) Svien; sisters-in-law, Mary (Dan) Schiltz and Suzanne (Rick) Wells; many nieces; nephews; cousins; extended family and friends.
