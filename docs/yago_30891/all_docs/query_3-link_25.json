        "text": "Mary Fickett, who acted in theater, movies and television before becoming a legend among followers of the daytime drama \"All My Children\" as Ruth Martin, a nurse unafraid to speak her mind, died Thursday (Sept. 8, 2011) at her home in Callao, Va. She was 83.\n\nThe cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her daughter, Bronwyn Congdon, said.\n\nOn Broadway, Ms. Fickett played Eleanor Roosevelt and replaced Deborah Kerr in \"Tea and Sympathy.\" She also joined with Harry Reasoner to host a CBS-TV morning news and entertainment show and appeared in a movie with Bing Crosby. But for three decades, she was best known as the pillar of the popular soap opera.\n\nIn 1973, she won the first Emmy presented to an actor for daytime drama when her character gave an impassioned speech against the Vietnam War, considered a bold move on conservative daytime TV. She received Emmy nominations as well for an episode in which her son was missing in action and for another in which she was a rape victim.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn the emotional and sexual roller coaster of soap operas, Agnes Nixon, creator of \"All My Children,\" juggled the conventions of the form with her mission to explore deeper issues. To do this in the context of a fictional small town, Pine Valley, required central characters who would, like the matriarch Ruth, embody stable values.\n\n\"There has to be some core around which other people disintegrate and come together again,\" Ms. Fickett said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. \"If the place were in chaos all the time, you wouldn't have some place to bounce off of. They've had problems — Ruth was raped, and she had an affair — but viewers want to believe there is a core.\"\n\nMary Fickett grew up in Bronxville, N.Y. Her father was Homer Fickett, who directed the radio series \"Theater Guild on the Air.\" She attended Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. She studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater under Sanford Meisner, and joined the Actors Studio, where she studied with Elia Kazan.\n\nShe was in the first episode of \"All My Children\" on Jan. 5, 1970, and continued regularly until 1996, when she left to take care of her husband, Allen Fristoe, who was ill. She returned in 2000 to appear in occasional episodes.\n\nABC has canceled \"All My Children\" because of what it calls \"changing viewing patterns.\" The last episode will be shown Sept. 23. The network will dedicate the Sept. 21 episode to Ms. Fickett.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
