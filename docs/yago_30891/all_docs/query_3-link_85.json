        "text": "Allow local governments to impose rent controls\n\nJump to section\n\nWhat would it do?\n\nMany cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, limit the amount a landlord can raise the rent each year — a policy known as rent control. But for nearly 30 years, California has imposed limits on those limits, via a law known as Costa-Hawkins. Cities cannot set rent control on single-family homes or apartments built after 1995. And landlords are free to set their own rental rates when new tenants move in.\n\nIf Proposition 33 passes, that would change. Cities would be allowed to control rents on any type of housing – including single-family homes and new apartments, and for new tenants.\n\nWhy is it on the ballot?\n\nNearly 30% of California renters spend more than half their income on rent — higher than in any other state except Florida and Louisiana, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nTo change that, tenant advocates have been fighting Costa-Hawkins for years, but so far, without success. They tried to overturn it with ballot measures in 2018 and 2020. Lawmakers also tried with legislation. While those efforts failed, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2019 signed a law limiting annual rent increases statewide to 5% plus inflation.\n\nSupporters of Prop. 33 say that doesn’t go far enough. They hope this finally is the year to upend the decades-old rules controlling rent control. But landlord groups opposing the idea tend to have deep pockets, and have been willing to spend a small fortune to convince voters that rent control is not the answer to the state’s housing crisis.\n\nTake the Prop Quiz\n\nFind out if you agree or disagree with Proposition 33 to inform your 2024 ballot →\n\nFunders\n\nPolling Data\n\nRelated News"
