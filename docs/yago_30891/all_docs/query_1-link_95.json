        "text": "It was the early 1990s, and I was writing a book about health care for the poor that eventually would be called Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America. The project was based on three years of research—analytic reporting about our nation's health care system and the intimate chronicling of the lives of one multigenerational family. I'd start writing at 7 a.m. and end for the morning at 11:55 sharp. Then I'd get up from my desk, make myself a sandwich, shuffle into the living room (usually still in my pajamas), and switch on All My Children. The soap opera, considered, in the words of one pop-culture scholar, \"a degraded cultural and aesthetic form,\" was mandatory for me. If I didn't take set breaks, I feared I would burn out and be unable to finish my book. All My Children was an amulet against failure, or a cleansing sorbet for the brain.\n\nI'd been degrading myself since I was a girl, thanks to my mother. She liked to have on All My Children when she ironed. To this day, she never \"watches\" TV; she \"has it on.\" This is partly her snobbishness—she doesn't like to admit to actually sitting down and watching the \"boob tube\" —and in fact, she usually was doing 10 things at once, which means she used the show exactly as soaps were intended to be followed when they began on radio in the 1930s. They were written in a way so that housewives could listen while scrubbing the floor or even take a break to answer the doorbell without losing the flow of the story. So while my mother fastidiously pressed my father's button-down shirts, I raptly absorbed the clandestine kisses, fake pregnancies, and near-death experiences flickering before me. All My Children was the only soap my mother followed, and she let me know that she admired it because it dealt progressively with social issues. That sounds hilarious, I know, but as a girl I believed wholeheartedly in my mother's liberal-minded righteousness—and, hey, Erica Kane, the main character on AMC for the past 38 years, did have the first legal abortion on TV! Not for health reasons, either—she wanted to continue her modeling career. I know; my mother told me so.\n\nShe stopped watching, for good, in the mid-1970s, when she and millions of other women entered the paid workforce. By 1977, the number of American households watching daytime TV, soap operas included, was beginning its long decline.\n\nI, however, didn't abandon Erica or Adam or Jack or Phoebe. I kept up with AMC during school vacations, on sick days, and in the summer. With All My Children, I found I could go a few weeks, a few months, even a year without seeing an episode and still quickly get reacquainted with the doings in Pine Valley.\n\nLast February, I took a leave from editing at ELLE to write my second book. And one morning when I was sitting at my desk, having just sent my two little daughters off to school, I thought, Omigod (as the young hipster characters say on AMC), I can eat lunch with All My Children again! So I did.\n\nTwo short months later, this e-mail arrived in my inbox: \"Laurie Abraham to costar with Rebecca Budig on All My Children.\" What?!? Me? I had to read it twice; the cognitive dissonance was too extreme. I am sort of the Poindexter of ELLE: a politics, Freud, and feminist-history geek who can be depended on to say woefully ignorant things like, \"We're going to write about the pop music career of the Duchess of York?\" (Our subject, of course, was Fergie the singer, not Fergie the Weight Watcher.)\n\nAs it happened, I was the recipient of a mass mailing from AMC publicist. In part to reverse the \"great stigma\" attached to soaps, he was looking for women's magazine editors to spend the day on the set with Budig. (Her character is the drop-dead gorgeous Greenlee Smythe, once a mere \"rich bitch,\" in Budig's words, but now a sassy, savvy cosmetics executive with her heart in the right place.) I was so excited that I was trembling. I'd just been blessed with the kind of serendipitous turn of fortune that is routine for Erica, who has survived a kidnapping, a plane crash, a standoff with a grizzly bear, a helicopter rescue of her lover from prison, and 10 marriages to seven men.\n\nThe year I was born, 1964, the essayist Susan Sontag defined camp as a sensibility that presumed there was a \"good taste of bad taste,\" that there was a high of low. It would be acceptable in my writer/editor/lawyer crowd to say that I appreciate AMC as camp. Erica, whom TV Guide called \"unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,\" is camp incarnate. In fact, when I reread Sontag's \"Notes on Camp,\" I was amazed. It was written as if Sontag were watching Erica vamp her way across the screen; watching her coquettishly dip her chin into her shoulder, bat her lashes, coo at her man, or, alternately, screech in anger, impetuously demand her due, and roll her impossibly large brown eyes in disgust.\n\nIn the art of camp, Sontag writes, \"Character is understood as a state of continual incandescence—a person being one, very intense thing.... Garbo's incompetence (at the least, lack of depth) as an actress enhances her beauty. She's always herself.\" The failure of Susan Lucci, the actress who plays Erica, to win a lead-actress Emmy 18 years running actually became a kind of cultural cri de coeur both inside and outside the soap industry. When she finally broke the curse in 1999, it was for her work on a naturalistic story line involving her daughter Bianca's anorexia. Compare that with what Erica is doing now: She's in prison for insider trading, strutting around in an orange jumpsuit cinched at the waist, with a deep V-neck and cap sleeves, which some fellow inmates (presumably on sewing detail) graciously altered for her.\n\n\"As a taste in persons,\" Sontag goes on, camp evinces a \"relish for the exaggeration of sexual characteristics.\" Evidence: Erica's \"bump\" (not the pregnancy variety). When I was getting my hair done for a brief appearance on the show—I had one line as an ELLE editor who runs into Greenlee at a bar—the stylist started poufing my hair at the crown. I must have looked curious about this, because she volunteered, \"Women in soaps have to have bumps.\" That's when it struck me—Erica has a massive bump. \"Yeah,\" the stylist said, \"Susan loves her bump.\"\n\nIt is Lucci, the actress, who is responsible for elevating her character into the realm of what Sontag called the best kind of camp, \"pure camp,\" which is always \"naive.\" Camp is \"seriousness that fails,\" and Lucci plays her character straight. The actress obviously gets the outlandishness of Erica, and the writers of the show wink at it by giving her some genuinely funny lines. In one episode from the '80s, Joe Martin, an elderly doctor who's the soul of rectitude, rumbles to Erica, \"I can't believe you're this selfish.\"\n\n\"Where have you been all these years?\" she shoots back, utterly indignant.\n\nYet you get the feeling, watching Lucci's long run, that she believes in Erica fervently. When she finally won her Emmy, she cried out to the audience, \"I'm going back to that studio on Monday, and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\" Sure, Lucci is an actress, but I believed in her passion. I believed that Erica was the actress's virtual raison d'être.\n\nEven as I love to guffaw at Erica's unhinged narcissism, camp is not why I keep coming back to All My Children. I'm not distanced enough from the show for that. As a girl, it was the lure of the forbidden that drew me, all that sex and romantic intensity that I'd yet to experience. That fantasy quality still appeals, but it's different. I sometimes think I envy the female characters because their lives are so anachronistically simple. They all have glamorous jobs, but they really only devote attention to their relationships: their men and their families.\n\nWhen I was younger, the soaps seemed a window into a wider world; now that I'm older, the world they depict seems soothingly small. I like AMC containment, its absurdly neat portrayal of emotional life. Couples in the soaps don't grow slightly bitter and alienated over the years, ambivalent about the depth of affection between them, or unsure whether to stay together. People are either wildly in love or vengefully split up (for a while, at least) because of some wretched betrayal or cataclysmic event. And no matter how insanely implausible the story lines, they affirm the most conventional, soft morality. (There is one example of this tendency that nettles me, however. A few years ago Erica learned that she had not really had an abortion, after all. Her fetus had been transferred into another woman's uterus, and the resulting child arrived in Pine Valley as Josh. So much for brave TV.)\n\nFurthermore, it's comforting to be in the presence of characters who feel like old friends. I especially love to watch in December—Christmas Day can last a whole week! All my favorites get dressed up (even more than usual) and attend fancy parties with twinkling trees and lavish decorations. They drink red punch from crystal bowls and nibble on canapés, and then there are all those diamond rings proffered by the tree.\n\nI know that instead of AMC I could take my lunch with Movies on Demand and pick a film that totally engrosses or edifies me, one that moves me to tears (I can't remember AMC doing that). I could watch a series with real power behind it, like an episode of The Sopranos or a segment of the new drama based on a psychoanalyst and his clients, In Treatment. I could, but, like Bartleby the Scrivener, I prefer not to. I prefer not to stray from Pine Valley. I know its denizens well, and I don't venture easily into new frontiers of schlock culture. I didn't start watching American Idol until its sixth season.\n\nPsychologists talk about the virtues of being stuck. Husbands and wives who are absolutely committed to their marriages—who believe they can't get out—tend to report being more satisfied than those who aren't. I am a pop culture conservative. I like limits.\n\nThus, the very homeliness of soaps, the less-than-glossy production values—the cameras that stick to static face and above-the-shoulder shots rather than showing people walking and talking—those confines only add to my appreciation. Budig seems pretty fine with the confines too—the grueling pace and the ever-present budget-tightening as the soaps struggle to compete with cable TV, daytime talk shows (which are much cheaper to make), DVRs, and the scads of excellent prime-time dramas that began borrowing the genre's serialization technique more than two decades ago. \"We're the blue- collar workers of acting,\" the actress cheerfully observes, noting that there are no minions to deposit her day's costume in her dressing room.\n\nThe relentlessness of the filming schedule—five days a week, 52 weeks a year—does not encourage consistently stellar acting, and Budig knows it. \"Sometimes you're great, and sometimes you suck.\" Other actors tend to look down on those who ply the soap trade, and while at one moment Budig is saying their haughtiness \"drives her crazy,\" the next she's proclaiming the benefits of the job. \"Are you freaking kidding me? We get paid to act every single day. And the hours are great.\" (She's usually out by 7 p.m.)\n\nShe is not, though, cavalier about her craft, like many of the actors on the show. On set I overhear several complaining about their lines, that their characters are becoming incoherent. \"You ask us to make a commitment—`Go deeper, go deeper,'\" says Thorsten Kaye, the actor who plays Zach. \"Then there's this big change that doesn't make sense. You can't have both.\" He is perturbed because the writers have Zach suddenly making peace with Aidan, who slept with Zach's wife. Sure, Aidan is just back from a heroic rescue mission in the Sudan (to attract male viewers, the soaps began including topical adventures, sci-fi, and mob stories in the 1980s). But who would forgive his friend's \"fucking his wife,\" as Kaye kept grumbling, based on his derring-do?\n\nYou could write off Kaye's disgruntlement as typical actor-writer squabbling, but plot has increasingly trumped character development on soaps, says C. Lee Harrington, a sociology professor at Miami University who studies daytime TV. \"The industry is really in trouble,\" she says, \"and soaps are doing everything they can to compete with prime time, which sometimes means characters making 180-degree turns. They're trying to mimic the pace of prime time, but it doesn't really go with the genre.\"\n\nThe soap world is abuzz, Harrington says, with rumors that NBC won't renew Days of Our Lives, the network's last remaining soap, when its contract comes up in 2009. Although All My Children is one of the higher-rated daytime dramas, even Budig admits, \"Soaps are a dying breed.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, if predictions of their demise were ever to come true, I'd be sad to lose Zach (and his incredibly sexy, gravelly voice), Greenlee, Erica, and the rest. Now that I've met the actors who play a few of the characters and been impressed by their down-to-earth professionalism, camaraderie, and graciousness, I'd be sad too, to think of their being out of work. Harrington says the main reason soap fans are mocked is the suspicion that they \"can't tell the difference between fiction and reality.\" Her research shows, of course, that that's a myth, that the members of the \"Ailee\" fan club—an online group founded on their enthusiasm for the upcoming nuptials of Aidan and Greenlee—have as firm a grip on reality as the next person.\n\nSoaps are akin to the child analyst Donald Winnicott's \"transitional objects,\" Harrington theorizes, \"allowing viewers to access an intermediate realm of reality...a space of play, pleasure, creativity, exploration, and fantasy.\" Adults are supposed to be beyond transitional objects, but think of a child talking to a beloved teddy bear—does she think the bear is real? She does and she doesn't. Do I think Greenlee is real? No, but she's alive, in my mind, especially around one o'clock. I live in Brooklyn, New York, on Midwood Street. For all I know, Pine Valley could be just down the road."
