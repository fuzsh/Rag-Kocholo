        "text": "Mary Fickett, who acted in theater, film and prime-time television before becoming a legend among followers of the daytime drama “All My Children” as Ruth Martin, a nurse unafraid to speak her mind, died on Thursday at her home in Callao, Va. She was 83.\n\nThe cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, her daughter, Bronwyn Congdon, said.\n\nOn Broadway Ms. Fickett played Eleanor Roosevelt and replaced Deborah Kerr in “Tea and Sympathy.” She also joined with Harry Reasoner to host a CBS-TV morning news and entertainment show and appeared in a movie with Bing Crosby. But for three decades, she was best known as the pillar of a popular soap opera.\n\nIn 1973, she won the first Emmy presented to an actor for daytime drama when her character gave an impassioned speech against the Vietnam War, considered a bold move on conservative daytime TV. She received Emmy nominations as well for an episode in which her son was missing in action and for another in which she was a rape victim.\n\n“There has to be some core around which other people disintegrate and come together again,” Ms. Fickett said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. “If the place were in chaos all the time, you wouldn’t have some place to bounce off of. They’ve had problems — Ruth was raped, and she had an affair — but viewers want to believe there is a core.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
