        "text": "This is the sixth post in our 2021 Halloween and Día de Muertos series about La Llorona, the best known legend of Spanish-speaking America. The series will be published in time for Día de Muertos (aka Día de los Muertos) 2021. [Find the whole series at this link!]\n\nLa Llorona, the Weeping Woman, is a spirit that haunts the folklore of Mexico and other Latin American countries. In some versions she’s a ghost, while in others she’s an immortal wanderer, not dead but not really alive either. In all versions, she weeps loudly in the night. So far in the series, we’ve introduced the legend, given some of its history, explored songs related to La Llorona, and discussed the story’s role in growing up. Now, we present a telling of the tale.\n\nBelow, you’ll find audio and a transcript of a performance by Joe Hayes, one of the best known storytellers from the American southwest. Hayes’s bilingual Spanish-English storytelling has earned him a distinctive place among America’s professional storytellers. He has published over 40 books, and has won numerous awards and accolades, including being named a New Mexico Eminent Scholar by the New Mexico Commission on Higher Learning, and receiving a New Mexico Governor’s Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts.\n\nHayes grew up in a small town in southern Arizona, where he learned Spanish from his Mexican American neighbors. He first learned the story of La Llorona in Spanish, from a friend’s grandmother, when he was a child. He made his version of La Llorona into a bilingual children’s book, which received an award for best children’s picture book at the International Latino Book Awards in 2005. Hayes has been featured many times at the National Storytelling Festival, so we have many performances of his among the collection associated with that great institution. In addition, he was featured as a storyteller at the Library of Congress National Book Festival in 2011. You can see video of that performance at this link.\n\nHayes’s performance in the player below comes from the 1987 National Storytelling Festival. It’s followed by my own transcription. I explained my transcription style in this previous post of a scary story; it’s a style grounded in the study of ethnopoetics which attempts to capture the prosody of the teller’s performance. After the transcription, you’ll find my brief commentary about Hayes’s version.\n\nSo now, without further ado…below find Joe Hayes’s version of “La Llorona.”\n\nWhat I’m gonna tell you\n\nis the best known story in the southwest.\n\nNot just the best known ghost story but by far the best known story.\n\nAnywhere you go in Texas or Arizona or New Mexico\n\nor California or southern Colorado\n\nAnywhere in Mexico or Central America\n\nThey know about La Llorona.\n\nIt means the Crying Woman, the Weeping Woman,\n\nLa Llorona,\n\nOf course everywhere you go, they have a different story.\n\nAnd they will swear that the story happened right there\n\nnot in some faraway place,\n\nright wherever you happen to be.\n\nSo I have given up on trying to figure out where it really did happen.\n\nBut people agree about this thing.\n\nIt all started a long time ago,\n\nin a very small town.\n\nThere was a girl living in that town\n\nwho was so beautiful,\n\npeople said she had to be the prettiest girl for 500 miles around.\n\nSome people said she was the most beautiful girl in the whole world.\n\nAnd that girl’s name\n\nwas Maria.\n\nBut because Maria was so beautiful, she thought she was better than everyone else.\n\nAnd she deserved the very best of everything.\n\nShe came from a good hardworking family.\n\nThey had a nice home.\n\nShe had pretty clothes to wear,\n\nbut she wasn’t satisfied.\n\nShe deserved much better things.\n\nAnd when she was a young woman,\n\nshe would have nothing to do with the young men from her town\n\nor the villages nearby.\n\nThey weren’t good enough for her.\n\nMany times when she was walking with her grandma in the evening,\n\nthe way young people used to do back in the old days,\n\nshe would tell her grandma:\n\n“Abuelita, cuando yo me case,\n\nvoy a casarme con el hombre más guapo de todo el mundo.”\n\n“Grandma,” she would say, “when I get married,\n\nI’m going to marry the most handsome man in the world.”\n\nAnd her grandma\n\nwould just shake her head.\n\nBut Maria would go on\n\nshe’d look out across the hillside and say:\n\n“His hair will be as black and as shiny\n\nas the raven sitting on that tree over there.\n\nAnd when he moves, he will be as strong and as graceful\n\nas the stallion my abuelito has in his corral.”\n\nAnd her grandma would tell her\n\nMaria, “caras vemos, corazones no sabemos.”\n\nIt’s an old saying.\n\nIt means we can see people’s faces: caras vemos.\n\nWe don’t know what’s in their hearts: corazones no sabemos.\n\nAnd she would tell her: “If you’re going to marry a man,\n\nyou be sure he’s a good man\n\nthat he has a good heart in him.\n\nWhy are you always talking about what his face looks like?”\n\nBut Maria thought:\n\n“Oh, these old people,\n\nthey have old fashioned ideas.\n\nThey don’t know anything.”\n\nAnd she wouldn’t listen to her grandma.\n\nAnd then one day a man came to town,\n\nand he seemed to be just the man she had been talking about.\n\nHe had been a cowboy out on the Llano Estacado.\n\nHe could ride anything.\n\nIn fact, if he was riding a horse and it got well trained,\n\nhe would give that horse away\n\nand go rope him a wild horse.\n\nHe thought it wasn’t manly for him to ride a horse that wasn’t half wild.\n\nAnd he was handsome.\n\nAll the girls were falling in love with him.\n\nHe could play the guitar.\n\nHe could sing beautifully.\n\nAnd Maria made up her mind.\n\nThat was the man she would marry.\n\nBut I told you how proud she was.\n\nSo of course, she would never let on.\n\nIf they would pass on the street and he would say hello,\n\nshe would just look away.\n\nHe came to her house in the evening and played his guitar\n\nand sang for her.\n\nShe wouldn’t even come to the window.\n\nAnd before long,\n\nthe cowboy made up his mind”\n\n“That proud girl Maria,\n\nI can win her heart.\n\nI think I’ll marry that girl.”\n\nSo things turned out just the way Maria wanted them to.\n\nAnd before long,\n\nthey were going to be married.\n\nHer parents told her,\n\n“Don’t marry him.\n\nHe won’t make a good steady husband.”\n\nBut she wouldn’t listen to her parents.\n\nShe got married.\n\nAnd for a while, things were fine.\n\nThey had two children.\n\nThey seemed to be a happy family together.\n\nBut after a few years\n\nthe cowboy went back to the wild life of the prairies.\n\nHe would leave town and be gone for months at a time\n\nand when he came home, he would tell Maria:\n\n“I didn’t come to see you.\n\nI just want to visit my children for a while.”\n\nHe would sit and play with the children.\n\nThen he would go off to the bars and drink wine and gamble all night long with his friends.\n\nHe talked about putting Maria aside\n\nand marrying a rich woman.\n\nWell, as proud as Maria was,\n\nshe became very jealous.\n\nAnd also\n\nshe began to feel jealous of her own children\n\nbecause he paid attention to them\n\nbut he just ignored her.\n\nAnd one evening she was standing in front of the house\n\nwith two children beside her\n\nand he came riding by in a carriage\n\nwith an elegant lady on the seat beside him.\n\nHe stopped and he spoke to his children.\n\nBut he didn’t even look at Maria.\n\nHe just drove on up the street.\n\nAnd when that happened,\n\nsomething just seemed to just snap inside Maria.\n\nShe felt such anger and such jealousy.\n\nAnd it all turned against her children.\n\nShe grabbed her two children by the arm\n\nand she dragged them with her down to the river.\n\nAnd even though it’s a sad thing to tell,\n\nthe story says that she threw her own children into the river.\n\nBut as they disappeared down the stream,\n\nshe realized what she had done\n\nand she ran down the bank of the river reaching out her arms\n\nas if she could get them back from the water.\n\nBut they were long gone.\n\nShe ran on,\n\ndriven by the guilt and the anger that was filling her heart.\n\nShe wasn’t paying attention to where she was going\n\nand her foot caught on a root.\n\nShe tripped and fell forward\n\nand her forehead (sound effect)\n\nstruck a rock and she was killed.\n\nThe next day, they looked for her all over town and they couldn’t find her.\n\nAnd then someone brought the word into town\n\nthat her body was out there on the bank of the river.\n\nThey went out and found her\n\nand they laid her to rest on the very spot where she had fallen.\n\nBut the first night she was in the grave,\n\nshe could not rest at peace.\n\nShe was up and walking\n\nall along the bank of the river.\n\nShe was dressed in a long, winding white sheet.\n\nThe way a body is dressed for burial\n\nThey saw her moving among the trees\n\nand they could hear her voice\n\ncrying and crying through the night.\n\nSometimes they thought it was just the wind they heard.\n\nBut other times if they listened more carefully,\n\nthey were sure they could hear words.\n\nIt would sound something like this:\n\n“Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii miiiiis hiiiiiiiijooooooos. Donde estan mis hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijoooooooos?”\n\n“Where are my children,” she was crying. “Donde estan mis hijos?”\n\nAnd she went all up and down the banks of the river\n\nthrough all the arroyos into the mountains\n\ndown along ditches and canals and acequias\n\nNight after night they saw her\n\nbut especially they would hear her crying outside.\n\nAnd so before long, no one spoke of her as Maria anymore.\n\nThey called her La Llorona,\n\nThe Crying Woman.\n\nLa Llorona.\n\nAnd they told the children:\n\n“When it gets dark,\n\nget back inside the house\n\nbecause La Llorona could be around here looking for her children.\n\nAnd she’s so crazy,\n\nif she sees you,\n\nshe won’t know if it’s you or her own child.\n\nShe’ll pick you up and carry you away\n\nor she’ll throw you into the river like she did to her own children\n\nand you will never be seen again.”\n\nAnd they say that down through the years\n\nmany children have been carried away\n\nby La Llorona.\n\nOne man even told me this:\n\nwhen he was a boy, he had a friend who did not believe that story.\n\nHis friend would say:\n\n“Oh, that’s a story parents made up to scare kids\n\nand make them come home at night.”\n\nThere’s no such thing as La Llorona.\n\nWell, the boys were down by the river one evening and it got late.\n\nThe other boys all said:\n\n“Look, it’s getting dark.\n\nWe better get home.”\n\nNot that one boy.\n\nHe said: “No.\n\nI’m having fun.\n\nI’m gonna stay right here.”\n\nThey couldn’t believe it.\n\nThey said, “aren’t you afraid of La Llorona?”\n\nAnd he just laughed at them.\n\n“Come on!\n\nYou don’t believe that, do you?\n\nThere’s no such a thing!”\n\nSo they went home and he stayed there all by himself.\n\nHe was throwing cans and sticks into the river\n\nhitting them with rocks as they came by.\n\nIt got really dark.\n\nAnd then the moon started to rise.\n\nThen all of a sudden\n\nhe felt like an icy cold wind was blowing through his clothes\n\nand all around him\n\nthere were dogs barking.\n\nHe looked around\n\nand there was a white shape coming through the trees\n\nand getting nearer.\n\nHe tried to turn and run but he was so frightened.\n\nHe couldn’t move.\n\nHe just stood there trembling,\n\nand the shape got closer\n\nuntil he could hear that high wailing\n\n“Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, miiiis hiiiiiiiiiiiiiijooooooooos!”\n\nBut still he couldn’t run away.\n\nSo he crouched down as small as he could.\n\nHe just hoped she wouldn’t see him.\n\nSuddenly he heard her say “mi hijo! my child!” she said and came toward him.\n\nHis face was as white as the sheet that La Llorona was wearing.\n\nBut he couldn’t run away.\n\nShe came up to him and reached out with her long,\n\ntwisted fingers and she took hold of his shoulders.\n\nWhen La Llorona’s fingers touched his shoulders\n\nit felt like icicles were cutting into his skin.\n\nJust then when La Llorona was about to pick him up and carry him away,\n\nback in town,\n\nthe church bells started ringing\n\ncalling the people for mass.\n\nAnd when the church bell rang,\n\na prayer went through the boy’s mind.\n\nAnd when that happened,\n\nLa Llorona dropped him and she disappeared through the trees.\n\nHe stayed there for a long time before he had his strength back.\n\nFinally he was able to run home and when he got home\n\nhis mother was angry.\n\nShe said “Where have you been?\n\nYou should have been home hours ago!”\n\nHe stuttered and stammered\n\n“Mama, mama, La Llorona.”\n\nShe said: “What?\n\nDon’t you go making up stories about La Llorona.\n\nYou should have been home a long time ago!”\n\nAnd she reached out and she was going to give him a good shaking,\n\nbut when she reached out to take hold of his shoulders,\n\nthen she saw on each shoulder\n\nthere were five round red marks like five bloodstains.\n\nThey had been left by La Llorona’s fingers.\n\nThen she believed him.\n\nShe took that shirt and washed it over and over but she could never get the stains out.\n\nAnd the man who told me about that said when he was a boy\n\nshe would come around the neighborhood and show them the shirt.\n\nShe would say: “Look here,\n\nyou can just count these: 1-2-3-4-5\n\nThose red marks were left by La Llorona’s fingers!\n\nWhen it gets dark get home because La Llorona can carry children away.”\n\nAnd you can bet the kids in that neighborhood got home when they got dark.\n\nBut I’ve never seen that shirt so I’m not going to swear that story’s true.\n\nNotes on Joe Hayes’s La Llorona\n\nScholars have noted that tales of La Llorona tend to fall into three categories: brief conversational mentions of La Llorona as something to be avoided; stories of particular encounters with La Llorona; and legends of how an ordinary woman was transformed into La Llorona. Joe Hayes incorporates all three into his tale. More specifically, this oral version is two stories in one: the story of how La Llorona came to be, followed by a detailed encounter story. This differs from Hayes’s published children’s book, which omits the encounter.\n\nInterestingly, Hayes’s version of the backstory of La Llorona is remarkably similar to the one remembered from childhood by Camille Acosta and presented in her master’s thesis, which you can read at this link. More than that, both Hayes’s and Acosta’s versions include the idea that La Llorona started out as a woman who had excessive pride in her own beauty. This connects them thematically to the version I turned up from Spain, which is at this link.\n\nMeanwhile, The encounter story Hayes tells is very much like the ones included in the book The Weeping Woman: Encounters with La Llorona by Edward Garcia Kraul and Judith Beatty. Hayes’s tale is therefore typical in some ways, and falls well within the mainstream of traditional La Llorona tales.\n\nHayes’s version of the legend also differs in some ways from most of the traditional ones I’ve quoted in previous posts in this series. In particular, most conversational versions begin with a description of La Llorona and a warning to avoid her. Only when pressed does the narrator tell something about La Llorona’s backstory. You can see that pattern, for example, in the versions of the story I presented in this previous post, such as those by Esperanza Sernas and Thatha Acosta.\n\nThis usual order might be a reflection of the history of La Llorona stories themselves. As I discussed in this previous post, the part of the story with the deepest roots in Latin America is the description and encounter story. What we might call the first recorded “La Llorona” encounter, which was mostly a description of her crying–took place among Indigenous Mexicans in 1509 and was recalled in the 1550s. The backstory of how a mortal woman came to be La Llorona seems to be a later importation from Europe, which was, in Américo Paredes’s words, “grafted” onto the deep roots of La Llorona encounter tales. It is telling that most Latinx tellers lead with the description, proceed to the encounter, and only get to the backstory when asked for more. That the most stripped-down tellings of the tale tend to include the Indigenous elements rather than the European ones tends to support Domino Renee Perez‘s contention that the tale is basically Indigenous, with a European overlay.\n\nJoe Hayes has reversed this usual order of tale-telling: he tells the backstory first, then relates an encounter story which contains the descriptive elements and clarifies some of the implications of meeting her. This follows a linear chronology, which might make it easier for kids to follow. It’s also fitting for a tale intended to entertain an audience rather than to convey a message within a particular conversational context. It shows how tales may change depending on the needs of different storytelling events.\n\nIf you’re interested, you can compare Hayes’s telling in this post to his telling of the tale in Spanish, which you can find at this link.\n\nThanks for reading and listening! I hope you enjoy your Halloween and Día de Muertos. It’s always a special time for us at Folklife Today!"
