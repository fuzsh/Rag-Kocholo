Central to the development of T2D is the exhaustion of β-cells functions resulting in inability to produce sufficient insulin. Chronic higher than normal levels of circulating nutrients such as glucose and free fatty acids (FFAs) are a hallmark of obesity and have been shown to interfere with the normal functions of the pancreas. This “obesogenic” environment has been known to disturb the regulation of intracellular lipid metabolism leading to lipotoxicity, progressive β-cell dysfunction and loss in T2D. The mechanisms however remain obscure. Increased supply of excess nutrients inside pancreatic cells can enter the synthetic metabolic pathway to produce triacylglycerol (TAG) lead to accumulation of fat in the pancreas known as non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease. They can also be used as substrates for production of sphingolipids, a class of lipid molecules several of which have bioactive properties. This project will focus on establishing a longitudinal in vitro model to study obesity-related pancreatic β-cell dysfunction due to altered obesogenic environment. The overall goal is to investigate the role of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in development of obesity-related pancreatic β-cells dysfunction. Using human pancreatic β-cell line as a model, the studies will focus on deciphering the precise cellular mechanisms by which sphingolipids affect β-cells’ functions and ability to secrete insulin.\n\nProject 2: Role of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in adipose tissue biology.\n\nAdipose tissue is an active endocrine and metabolic organ that secretes hundreds of different molecules including hormones and cytokines (aka adipokines). It is composed of several different cell types, the predominant one of which is adipocytes. The mature adipocytes arise from existing pre-adipocytes throughout the individual’s lifespan, thus enabling hyperplastic expansion of adipose tissue when increased storage requirements are needed. In addition, adipocytes can expand in size to accommodate increased storage needs during periods of excess nutrient supply. As a result, the overall metabolism and secretory properties of these cells as well as the differentiation of pre-adipocytes to mature cells undergo tremendous changes documented in numerous previous studies. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these changes, however, still remain poorly understood. The overall goal of this project is to understand how the metabolism of different lipids is regulated as pre-adipocytes undergo maturation and differentiation into mature adipocytes, followed by subsequent metabolic and morphological changes associated with increased energy demand. This will allow to begin identifying potential novel targets for drug development and therapy for obesity and other metabolic diseases associated with adipose tissue dysfunction.\n\nTanisha Denning, DO Associate Professor of Osteopathic Principles & Practice\n\nDr. Tanisha Denning serves as Associate Professor of Osteopathic Principles & Practice at the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nDr. Tanisha Denning serves as Associate Professor of Osteopathic Principles & Practice at the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nAlycia Dickman Academic Affairs & Foundational Sciences Coordinator\n\nAlycia Dickman serves as the Academic Affairs & Foundational Sciences Coordinator at the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.

She completed her residency in Family Medicine at Eastmoreland Hospital in Portland, Oregon in 1998.\n\nAlways interested in caring for the whole patient, she practiced full-scope family medicine in the semi-rural community of McMinnville, Oregon from 1998 – 2011, with a special focus on sports medicine, procedural medicine, and the lifestyle determinants of health. Teaching has always been a focus of her practice whether that be with patients, students, or residents. During her time in McMinnville, Dr. Dreibelbis served as the team physician and medical director at Linfield College and worked closely with the Athletic Training Department and students.\n\nShe has always been devoted to education and hosted many DO and PA students on clinical rotation over the years in order to teach at the bedside which allowed these students to learn from their best teacher…the patient. Her desire to more fully be involved in clinical teaching led her to Samaritan Health Service in Corvallis, OR where she served as the Program Director of the Family Medicine Residency from 2010 – 2013, interacting with both residents and students in the outpatient setting.\n\nIn 2011, Dr. Dreibelbis joined her alma mater in their expansion of the medical school to Lebanon, OR as the inaugural Vice Chair of the Department of Family Medicine (DFM) at WesternU/COMP-Northwest, and assumed the role of Chair of DFM, a position she held until she left COMP-Northwest to join the team at ICOM in 2021. During her time at COMP-Northwest she taught the Clinical Medicine and Reasoning course and served as the Chief Wellness Officer for the college and served on various local and statewide committees and organizations including Oregon Healthcare Workforce Committee, Oregon Graduate Medical Education Consortium, Oregon Wellness Committee, and the Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of Oregon (OPSO).\n\nAs an osteopathic physician she strives to care for her patients and teach her students using the foundational tenets of the osteopathic profession, one of which is that the body has the inherent ability to heal itself if given the opportunity. She felt so strongly that the students needed to have a strong foundational knowledge in the integral connection between nutrition and human health that in 2012 she started a lecture series called “Nutrition in Medicine” (NiM). NiM offers lectures presented by physicians and nutrition experts covering various topics about the relationship between nutrition and human health. With this knowledge, the conversations that she has each day with her patients will be duplicated many times over as the students she teaches will have that same knowledge to be able to positively impact their patients for decades to come.\n\nSteve Durham Campus Security Officer\n\nSteve Durham serves as a Campus Security Officer for the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.
