        "text": "Francesca James doesn't think there's any work harder than daytime serial television.\n\n\"We shoot 80 pages a day. People think of it as a stepchild (to evening TV and film) but that's just ignorance,\" James, a daytime veteran who's directing \"I Remember Mama\" at Monomoy Theatre in Chatham this week, said in a recent interview there. \"It's very, very hard work across the board, 52 weeks a year. I always say if you can do daytime, you can do anything.\"\n\nBut that teaching ground, and the opportunities for acting jobs, are diminishing because the daytime soap opera genre is dying. \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" — two of ABC's longest-running shows and ones that were key to James' career — are ending in September and January, respectively, replaced by lifestyle/talk shows.\n\n\"I don't think ABC wants to be in the business of daytime drama,\" James says simply.\n\nThere's been talk of the once phenomenally popular shows continuing on the Internet, but no details have been settled on or announced and she has not heard more from her many friends in the business.\n\n\"It was a very big part of my creative life for many years. I have many, many friends there,\" James says. With \"the family unit disintegrating\" in recent years, shows like \"All My Children\" created \"a pseudo-family for many people,\" she adds, referring to viewers. The shows are \"so dear to the hearts of so many people. It's sad to be losing that.\"\n\nJames was the first person to move from acting to directing to producing in daytime drama and has won acclaim for all three. When her \"All My Children\" character was marginalized — she created twins Kitty/Kelly Tyler starting in the 1970s — she asked to learn directing with no job guarantee. But she did get hired and directed that show for eight years. She was directing \"Loving\" (which ended in the 1990s), when a friend moved to Los Angeles and asked her to direct \"General Hospital\" — which will soon be ABC's only soap — out there. Her home was in New York and she said she'd become bicoastal only if she could produce. In six months, he called back with that offer and she moved between coasts for 20 years.\n\nPeople still often recognize James in person for Kitty/Kelly, especially if she's with friend Peter White, who played love interest Linc on the series. That those characters still mean something to viewers shows \"how potent\" that genre has been, she says.\n\nJames has been visiting Cape Cod, and actress friend Julie Harris, for decades, and watching dozens of local theater shows with her. But she is hardly the only local connection to the exiting \"All My Children.\"\n\nMary Fickett (Ruth Brent Martin) also has lived in Chatham and performed at Cape theaters. Local resident Natalie Ross Miller (Enid Nelson) has worked several times as a playwright with local theaters.\n\nAccording to a 1995 Times article, Ruth Warrick, a \"Citizen Kane\" veteran who played longtime matriarch Phoebe Tyler Wallingford and died in 2005, had an Eastham home for decades and Ray MacDonnell, Dr. Joe Martin, has lived part time in Provincetown.\n\nIn addition, Michael Knight (Tad Martin) and Christopher Lawford (Charlie Brent) have had family ties here. Knight filmed a movie in Falmouth in 2001, and Lawford is the son of the late Patricia Kennedy Lawford and actor Peter Lawford."
