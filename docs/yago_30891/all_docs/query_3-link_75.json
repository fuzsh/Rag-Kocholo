His parents moved to Orange County , where most of his life was spent, and came to Mitchell about four years ago. He was taken to the hospital at Bedford where he passed away after intense suffering. He was of quiet, loving disposition, no sacrifice being too great to make for his family and those about him.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 1614 (1914?), he was married to Emma Pipher. To this union were born four children, Mildred Elizabeth, who died in infancy; Mary Ethel, Blanche Estaline and Perry Clinton who survive.\n\nBesides his wife and three children he leaves to mourn his departure his mother and father, three brothers, Walter, Oscar and Lloyd, of Mitchell; five sisters, Mrs. Herbert Terry, of Shoals; Mrs. Harry Terry, of Mitchell; Mrs. Ben Wilson of Paoli; Mrs. Everett Harris and Mrs. Frank Smith, of Indianapolis; an aged grandfather and a number of other relatives and a host of friends.\n\nAt the age of seventeen he was first converted at Faucett chapel, a Methodist church in Orange County .

Church at Inman's Chapel at the age of eighteen, and lived a life consistent with its teachings. Aunt \"Sis\", as she was familiarly called, was an upright Christian woman, a devoted companion and loving mother.\n\nShe had been a sufferer from a complication of diseases for several years, but in spite of her failing health she remained cheerful and pleasant, and at different times had expressed a willingness to die.\n\nHer pathway was not always strewn with roses. There were some thorns as there always are in the christian life, but she overcame the trials and difficulties and seemed to grow stronger in the faith, and as the end was drawing near she seemed fully resigned to his Divine Will. Just before death she was unconscious but we all have reasons to believe that she is now treading the streets of the New Jerusalem.\n\nFuneral services were conducted at the Inman church by Rev. P.C.

Tewell tewellj@surfsouth.com\n\nDeath was Unexpected\n\nSamuel Montgomery Dead From A Sudden Attack of Paralysis\n\nSamuel Montgomery, aged sixty-two years and was well known in Loogootee and vicinity, died at 12 o'clock Wednesday night, about fourteen hours after he\n\nhad suffered a stroke of paralysis while at work making repairs on the roof\n\nof an outbuilding at the residence of Maj. Wm. Houghton in the northeast part of the city.\n\nMr. Montgomery, who of late had followed the work of doing odd jobs of\n\ncarpentering and repairing, was called to the Houghton residence Wednesday\n\nmorning to do some repair work on the roof of the washhouse. He had just\n\ncompleted the work when he suffered the fatal stroke and fell on a concrete walk near the outbuilding, where he was found some ten or fifteen minutes later by Mrs. Houghton when she started to go to the kitchen garden for some radishes for dinner.\n\nMrs. Houghton instantly realized that was something wrong with Mr.\n\nMontgomery, and, when he failed to make answer when she spoke to him, she\n\nhurried to the telephone and notified Mr. Houghton. A physician was summoned and hurried to the Houghton home.\n\nMr. Montgomery was unconscious when found by Mrs. Houghton at about 10\n\no'clock Wednesday and stayed in that condition until the end.\n\nAbout ten minutes before the prostrate man was found, a clattering noise\n\nemanating from the vicinity of the outbuilding was heard by Mrs. Houghton\n\nand a neighbor woman who was at work in her garden near the Houghton home.\n\nThis with the fact that a tall step-ladder on which Mr. Montgomery had first been working was found lying beside him led to the belief that he had fallen from the ladder and sustained an injury that rendered him unconscious. This, however, was disproved by\n\nexamination of the sick man after he had been removed to his home, the examination failing to reveal any bruises or other marks to indicate that he had fallen any distance, and the physicians decided that his condition was the result of an attack of paralysis.\n\nMr. Montgomery had been a resident of Loogootee for a number of years,\n\nhaving moved here from the country north of town, and was a well known and\n\nrespected citizen. He is survived by his wife and nine children. The\n\nchildren are Mrs. Will Crane of Neponset, Illinois; Willis, Bradford, Illinois; Jasper of this city; Robert of Ridge, Montana; Cleveland, of Sikeston, Missouri; John, of Toulon, Illinois; Mrs. Lish Cray, of this city; Mrs. George Tewell, of Washington; and Floyd, who\n\nis at home. He also leaves a brother, William Montgomery, north of town, and a sister who lives in Odon.\n\nFuneral services will be conducted at the residence this morning at 9 o'clock, following which interment will take place at Goodwill Cemetery.\n\nSource: The Sentinel, Friday, June 9, 1916\n\nCourtesy of: James R.

He was returning (to work) from his dinner and started to cross the\n\ntrack when he was stuck by the east bound passenger train and hurled into\n\neternity. He was dead before anyone reached him, and some were within a few feet. An inquest was held and it was found that his neck and back were broken. He leaves a wife and five children, the oldest of which is a boy sixteen years old. His hand was\n\nmashed by the cars (railroad) some two years ago and since that time he has not been able to do much. We never know how soon we will be called away from this earth. He little thought when he ate his dinner with his family that in a half hour he would be brought home a corpse, and yet it might have been you or I.\n\nContact: James R.
