        "text": "Mr. Church received a positive review from the Hollywood Reporter after its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April, but it didn’t track as well with critics when it hit theaters in on September 16th. The New Yorker’s Richard Brody called the movie “abominable” and compared the status of Eddie Murphy’s career to Jerry Lewis’s post-1960.\n\nIn April we interviewed Mr. Church screenwriter and brainchild Susan McMartin. She addressed her approach to portraying the real-life Mr. Church’s race on screen and what she thinks of critical aggregate websites like Rotten Tomatoes. McMartin also provides a formidable apologetic for, essentially, her personal indie film that happens to star the biggest acting personality of the late 20th century.\n\nFilm Party: You started writing Mr. Church in in 2004. What took so long to bring it to theaters?\n\nSusan McMartin: Long story short, the story is based on a real friendship with Mr. Church, who came into my life when I was a little girl and my mom was dying of cancer. He ended up being the most important person in my life. He was a best friend, father figure, and the reason I became a writer. My mom ended up surviving cancer, but in the movie, she’s not so lucky. After he passed away I wanted to write his story but didn’t know how to do it. Then I had a baby and I was sad because she would never get to meet Mr. Church and I knew he would love her. One day I was taking a walk with my dog and I heard the first line of dialogue and the next thing I knew I was writing the script. The movie is based on true events but I took a lot of creative license.\n\nThe script came fast and then Samuel L. Jackson’s manager read it and they immediately optioned it. Getting it made was a challenge. We would get a director then Sam wouldn’t be available, so for five years we tried to get this movie made. When the option ran out I decided not to renew it and then it just sat for two years. Everybody who read it loved it but no one would take it on. Then Invision Media read the script and decided to make it. Sam never lost his love of the script but he couldn’t stay on the project so we lost the financing. We had to be opening to finding another actor and Eddie Murphy was at the top of our list. We never in a million years thought we’d actually get Eddie because he doesn’t do dramas or small budget movies. But halfway through reading the script Eddie called his manager, crying, and said he wanted to do it. It took ten years but we finally got it made. Eddie embodied the real Mr. Church in my life.\n\nFP: Were there any movies that shaped your script?\n\nSM: One of my favorite movies is Terms of Endearment, and my movie is nothing like it, but the element of the mother-daughter relationship, the spanning of time, and life unfolding unexpectedly and outside of your control but in the end it makes sense, those elements made it into the movie. I like movies like Forrest Gump where people touch each other’s lives and you have one moment that might shape someone’s trajectory for the rest of their life, how we’re all sort of a ripple effect of each other. Everything is exactly the way it’s supposed to be. In the moment we don’t understand why things happen the way they do, but like what Mr. Church said to me, “books are to be read start to finish but they’re best understood from end to beginning.”\n\nFP:\n\nWere you involved in the production?\n\nSM: I will say Bruce Beresford (director) is the most incredible, generous director. He welcomed me on set every day and involved me in every part of the process. Not a line of dialogue was changed unless I changed it. What he shot is the movie I wrote. I was spoiled, he treated my words and treated my story with such respect. My other writer friends say I’m never going to have another experience like that again because we’re never this involved in the production. But I was part of the casting process, design, and editing the script; it was an incredible experience. He even invited me to give my thoughts in the editing room. Bruce set the tone for the whole crew, he’s a calm presence, Eddie even said the vibe was one of the best experiences he had on a movie set. I think it took this long to make because it needed all of these players to be here.\n\nFP: Tell me about the real Mr. Church.\n\nSM: Mr. Church was a talented jazz musician, painter, designer and overall artist. Everything he touched he was brilliant at, but he chose to make his living as a cook. He was always a bit of a mystery to me because he was extremely private. He gave unconditional love, but he appreciated his private time and I had to be sure not to cross his boundaries. Bruce really loved my writing because it’s a love letter to this man. He spent his life making me feel seen and I was a child who didn’t feel seen by the world, and this is my way of saying I saw him too.\n\nFP: Race relations and police brutality are all over the news and in recent movies. Were you thinking about America’s racial dialogue when making Mr. Church?\n\nSM: No, and that was a conscious decision, because in my life with him I didn’t experience that. I remember only one time when I was a little girl he was holding my hand as we crossed the street, this isn’t in the movie, but I remember seeing our skin next to each other and saying “white, black, white, black.” He was holding a leather glove in his other hand that was black and he said “this glove is black. Now look at this glove next to my hand, is that the same color?” I said no, and I was wearing a white shirt and he had me compare my hand to the color of the shirt, and I said my hand was pink. That was the only time that we talked about color at all.\n\nI grew up in a liberal home and my mom marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and because there was no racism in this friendship from us or other people I didn’t bring that into the movie. I could’ve written a movie that was heavily about race but that wouldn’t be true to my experience, it would be the temperature of the world.\n\nI debated putting the anecdote about the glove in the movie but that was one moment in a twenty-year friendship. As a kid, the glove experience made me be more specific when I’m talking and really think about what I’m saying. I remember when Driving Miss Daisy came out people loved it because it was about a friendship that developed and in the end he was the only one there for this woman. Over time that movie’s been vilified. What does that say about us as people that everything has to be about race?\n\nEverybody who sees this film is going to have an opinion. I did take creative license on certain things but I took them because that’s part of storytelling. I feel very protective of my friendship with this man and who he was. He was a very private man in real life and he had some demons and secrets. In the movie Charlotte (Britt Robertson) wants to know more and he’s not allowing her to and in real life that was kind of the case too. As much as I reveal and hint at some of the demons in his life, I leave it for the audience to figure out. I wanted to respect his privacy in his death as well.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SusanMcMartin/status/778247574780116992\n\nFP: What do you think of sites like Rotten Tomatoes where too many or too few reviews can skew the numbers? Or when critics don’t like the movie but the audience does.\n\nSM: Well, it’s interesting because I’m guilty of going on Netflix and basing what I watch in the Rotten Tomatoes numbers. I’m a viewer too, and sometimes I don’t care what Rotten Tomatoes says because I’m interested in a subject or actor, so I feel like it’s good to have critics to weed through things and help us make choices, but I think that ultimately if you’re drawn to an idea or story, screw what the critics say and watch it anyway. Sometimes after watching it I’ll agree with the critics but I’m often glad I followed my instinct even if it wasn’t a perfect movie. You can pull apart any movie and people do it all the time, but I’m always looking for something in a movie that resonates. Those are important too.\n\nMr. Church is in select theaters nationwide."
