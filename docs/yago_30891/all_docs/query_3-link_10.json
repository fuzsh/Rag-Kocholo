        "text": "Share\n\nSharon Ruth Martin (nee Carroll) 1945 – 2024\n\nSharon Ruth Martin (78), of Ormond Beach, Florida, passed away on April 30, 2024, surrounded by family. She is finally beside still waters after a turbulent twelve-year tour.\n\nBeloved wife of Edward T. Martin; loving mother of Deborah (David) Martin and Kristen (Ray) Bies; devoted grandmother of Findley; dear sister of Anne (late Patrick) Brady, Joyce (Richard) Hall, Frederick (Blanche) (late Karen) Carroll, and Timothy (Candy) Carroll; loving aunt to Thomas (Diane) Brady, James (Nancy) Brady, late Brian Hall, Kathleen (James) Slate, Patricia (Garrett) Heberlein, Joseph Carroll, Susan Carroll, Jennifer (Scott) Ogata, Sean (Jill) Carroll, and Michelle (Joshua) Klotzbach; dear friend to Carol (late Michael) Dowling, Kathleen (late Todd) Herzog, Mary Sue Gressley, Roseanne (Robert) Sticht, and her sorority hens; fond patient of oncologists Dr. Kelvin Lee and Dr. Christopher Alexander.\n\nDaughter of the late Harold and Ruth Carroll, Sharon attended Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart, later returning to the school system as a teacher at St. James. She also worked as a switchboard operator, a secretary, a freelance typist, and from home as a child-minder. Her various charges—including her daughters—took mystery rides to the art gallery, the zoo, the library, the SPCA—and each child had a paper sack of snacks for the trip. From the mid-80’s until her retirement in 2010, the accounting department at Hard Manufacturing became her daily grind, much to Sharon’s chagrin. She was never fond of numbers.\n\nAfter their retirement, Sharon and Ed moved from their Tonawanda, New York, home to Ormond Beach, Florida. Despite Sharon’s medical issues, they enjoyed a happy retirement in a thriving and friendly community.\n\nAnyone with the privilege of knowing Sharon will recall her abundant generosity, her staunch advocacy, and warm, genuine compliments. Her strong, 54-year marriage to her diamond-in-the-rough Edward is an inspiration to all.\n\nAlthough Sharon loved flowers, she loved helping others more. Numerous organizations have benefitted from her generosity over the years, but we think the Ten Lives Club of Buffalo would be a good tribute if you feel so inclined. She was always a champion of the under[cat].\n\nThere will be two Celebration of Life services:\n\nSaturday, May 25, at 1:00 p.m. at St. Bernadette Church, 5930 South Abbott Road, Orchard Park, NY 14127, with a reception to follow.\n\nSaturday, June 8, at noon at Prince of Peace Catholic Church, 600 South Nova Road, Ormond Beach, FL 32174, with a reception to follow."
