        "text": "Rutina \"Ruth\" Preziosi was the youngest of twelve children born to Italian immigrants Giovanni and Agrippina Preziosi. Though born in Rhode Island, Ruth became a California girl while still a child when her family moved to Fresno, California. She had a love for learning and discovered that she was quite good at school. After attending college in Fresno, Ruth wanted to help others learn, so she became a teacher at the Fresno College of Business. She didn't drive, so she would wake up extra early, often while still dark out, to take the bus to work, a practice that would continue throughout her life. This was during a time when most women didn't work outside the home, particularly in the business world, and doing so was actually frowned upon by many. In that respect, Ruth was a true trailblazer for women's rights, daring to compete in a \"man's world\" without the support of the organized and eventually irresistible women's liberation movement which was still several years away. She was not too timid to tell the world, \"I can do anything a man can do\". Individual women like Ruth were the scattered seeds from which such movement could sprout and eventually flourish.\n\nBut Ruth had another side to her. She was dedicated to her family, particularly her mother, who was the person closest to her in life, but who suffered from debilitating arthritis in her legs and a heart condition. Ruth lived in the family home with her parents and oldest brother Carl, making sure that her parents were well taken care of— doctor’s appointments, medicine schedules, diet restrictions etc. After work, she would help her mom to the kitchen where they would prepare the night's supper. After dinner and the dishes were done, Ruth and her mom would sit and watch TV. They particularly liked the Dean Martin Show. Ruth also brought her love of teaching to her family. She generously devoted her time to nephews who lived very close to her, playing educational-type games with them, teaching them math and English skills (her specialties), to speak and understand Italian, and even teaching one nephew to type and take shorthand while he was still in grade school.\n\nRuth also had a fun side to her. She enjoyed listening, singing along and dancing to the pop music of her time. She would dance around the house when one of her all-time favorites would come on her transistor radio-Petula Clark's \"Downtown\"! Ruth was thrilled when she got the opportunity to meet Petula Clark in person. Ruth was at Warner After their father and mother passed, Ruth and her brother Carl moved back to Rhode Island. Ruth began a new career working for the government, bought a condo, and reunited with her brothers and sisters, and their families, who had remained in Rhode Island during the years she was in Fresno. She enjoyed travelling, even making a trip back to the old country to visit her parents' families still living in and around Rome, Italy. While in town, Ruth very much enjoyed going out with her nieces and going to dances. She would brag about her \"Hully Gully\" skills.\n\nRuth loved all of her brothers and sisters dearly. She was particularly close to her youngest brother Rudy. His passing was profoundly traumatic for her. Similarly, she was very close to her sister Laura, and was very proud that Laura had entrusted her to be godmother to her two sons. Unfortunately, she experienced the loss of Laura very close in time to Rudy's passing, in addition to the passing of her sister Tina and her brothers Joe and Vincent. These losses took their toll on Ruth and caused her great anxiety, which at times was perceived as being something other than just the anguish and fear that can come from losing the people closest to you. Ruth was never one to give up, however, so she persisted.\n\nRuth made it to her nineties. She wanted to live to a hundred— a hundred and thirteen to be exact. She was so stubborn that most people thought she would make it. The downside to her longevity was that Ruth endured the sorrow of seeing all of her siblings pass before her. As the last living child of Giovanni and Agrippina, Ruth was preceded in death by her parents, her brothers Columbo I, Columbo II (Carl), Earl, Joseph, Vincent, Rudy, and her sisters Verna, Theresa, Tina and Laura. She is survived by sister-in-law Norma and many, many nieces, nephews, great nieces, great nephews, other relatives and friends. She is loved and will be missed."
