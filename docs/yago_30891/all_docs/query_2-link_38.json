        "text": "A graduate of Northwestern University, Elizabeth was an editor at various imprints including St. Martin’s Press, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books for Young Readers before joining Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2017. She represents books for kids, with a focus on middle-grade and young adult fiction, as well as books for adults, with an eye torwards upmarket women’s fiction. She loves books that explore romantic relationships, stories that have a very specific point of view, and characters that make a lasting impression. Elizabeth’s clients’ books have won various awards, including The Pura Belpré Award, ALA Notable, the Jane Addams Children’s Book Award, The New York Times Best Book of the Year, and have appeared on the USA Today and New York Times bestseller lists. Elizabeth loves realistic fiction (our world is a fascinating place!), and she is currently on the hunt for historical fiction.\n\nDanielle Bukowski\n\nDanielle represents critically acclaimed, award-winning fiction and nonfiction. She is particularly looking for narratives from writers traditionally excluded from the publishing industry. For fiction, she likes books that balance plot with voice, have a strong sense of place, a unique hook, and are stylistically bold; for nonfiction, she’s looking for work grounded in the author’s personal interest, rigorously reported and researched, and will expand the reader’s view of the world. Recent and forthcoming books include Sea Change by Gina Chung (Vintage), A Haunting on the Hill by Elizabeth Hand (Mulholland), Victim by Andrew Boryga (Doubleday), Loneliness & Company by Charlee Dyroff (Bloomsbury), People of Means by Nancy Johnson (William Morrow), Alligator Tears: A Memoir-in-Essays by Edgar Gomez (Crown 2025), I Leave it Up to You by Jinwoo Chong (Ballantine), and Mutual Interest by Olivia Wolfgang-Smith (Bloomsbury).\n\nJessica Friedman\n\nJessica joined Sterling Lord Literistic in 2020, having worked previously as an agent at The Wylie Agency. She represents literary fiction and nonfiction, and is interested in distinctive voices and writing that challenges the expected -- stylistically, formally, or otherwise. She is particularly drawn to incisive, voice-driven writing and underrepresented narratives. Jessica graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in English and an MA in the humanities.\n\nMary represents literary and upmarket fiction, narrative nonfiction, and select memoir, prescriptive, and illustrated projects. Whether in fiction or nonfiction, Mary gravitates toward work that is fierce, sharp, nuanced, and uncompromising. In fiction, she is looking for work that is inventive and strange, brave and honest, with humor and heart. She especially loves fiction that employs genre elements—whether evocatively surreal or supernatural—to speak about a world that is always in flux and difficult to perceive and render. In nonfiction, Mary responds to work that explores our experience of being in relation: to ourselves, to one another, to the material world, and to all we cannot see but strive to comprehend. In both fiction and nonfiction, work that investigates culture, identity, sexuality, disability, and mental health is especially welcome. Some of Mary’s clients include Kavita Bedford, Betsy Bonner, Nandita Dinesh, Stacy Austin Egan, Kristine S. Ervin, Kimberly Olson Fakih, Shelby Lorman, Vyshali Manivannan, Ashlee Piper, Betty Shamieh, Yana Tallon-Hicks, Sharon Sochil Washington, and Ellen O’Connell Whittet, and she co-represents the Berenstain Bears franchise with Flip Brophy. Mary received her MFA in Fiction from Columbia University and has a deep appreciation for dark chocolate; her other interests include film, television, art, and design.\n\nJenny represents nonfiction in a variety of categories including cookbooks; practical lifestyle projects; prescriptive books particularly in the wellness and mindfulness spaces; and narrative writing on environmental, social, and economic justice; natural sciences; history; food; and cultural criticism. For both adults and kids, she is often drawn to visual books that inform and explore through both text and image. Her clients include Ariel Aberg-Riger, Andrea Bemis, Khiara Bridges, Paco de Leon, Mary L. Gray, Debbie Hines, John Holl, Alicia Kennedy, Gina Rae La Cerva, Chelsey Luger and Thosh Collins, Olivia McGiff and Sammi Katz, Desmond Patton, Nicole Stott, and Wei Tchou. In addition, Jenny is honored to represent select literary estates on behalf of the agency, including the estate of National Book Award winning author Gloria Naylor and the estate of novelist Ken Kesey. Jenny grew up in Maine and studied English and film at Colby College. She joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2012.\n\nSzilvia joined Sterling Lord Literistic in 2011 as the Foreign Rights Director. Szilvia also represents the Angolan-Danish writer and artist Aaiún Nin (Broken Halves of a Milky Sun, Astra Books, 2022), the award-winning Arabic writer and poet Iman Mersal, and the Kathy Acker Estate. Previously she was a literary agent at Salomonsson Agency in Stockholm, working with a range of internationally prominent writers, including Sofi Oksanen, Karolina Ramqvist, and Antti Tuomainen. She graduated from University College London in 2007 with First Class Honors, studying Hungarian and Comparative Literature, and began her publishing career at ICM Books London as the assistant to the Foreign Rights Director. Originally from Budapest, Hungary but raised in Sweden, Szilvia splits her time between New York City and Austin, Texas.\n\nAmanda joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2022 and works with Szilvia Molnar in the Foreign Rights Department. She is drawn to all kinds of Young Adult books, stories with strong female main characters and literature that focuses on family relationships. She previously worked for the University of Arizona Press as a Permissions Assistant and the University Press of Florida as an Acquisitions Assistant. Amanda graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in English and a focus in creative writing. She lives in Manhattan with her two cats, Oliver and Roo.\n\nChristopher joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2019 and works with Peter Matson and Jim Rutman. He is looking for a broad range of literary fiction and upmarket commercial fiction with an unexpected hook. In non-fiction he is interested in narrative nonfiction, cultural criticism/essay, and expert-driven projects across subject areas with special attention to technology, food, pop-science, philosophy, and any book that asks big questions about forces of change. As a Singaporean/French/American born and raised in London, Christopher is drawn to international voices and writers in translation. His clients include Carnegie Medal winner Manon Steffan Ros, James Beard winner Shane Mitchell, Polish firebrand Agnieszka Szpila, among others. He graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill as a Morehead-Cain Scholar and now lives in Brooklyn.\n\nLiterary assistants\n\nPearl Cadigan\n\nPearl joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2023 and works with Laurie Liss and Nadyne Pike. She enjoys both fiction and nonfiction and gravitates toward stories that explore identity and culture, center underrepresented voices, and follow characters through periods of growth. In fiction, she looks for emotionally impactful books that possess a strong and distinct voice and don’t shy away from darkness or strangeness. In nonfiction, she is interested in books that question norms and seek new ways of understanding the world. These include works of narrative nonfiction, memoir, cultural criticism, essays, and — generally — books that explore gender, sexuality, wellness, media, and social justice. Pearl graduated with a BS in Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism from Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\nDani Leshgold\n\nDani joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2024 and works with Sarah Landis and Robert Guinsler. Dani is drawn to stories that look at the mundane under the light, revealing something beautiful, unsettling, or urgent. She loves literary fiction that keeps her up at night, grounded fantasy that uncovers real emotion and truths, and books that sweep her off her feet with their atmosphere. Dani is also interested in essay collections that explore identity, place, or relationships, be that with another person, oneself, or the world around them. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Dani now enjoys watching the seasons change from her window in Brooklyn.\n\nTyler Monson\n\nTyler joined Sterling Lord Literistic, Inc. in 2023 and assists Doug Stewart, Neeti Madan, and Nadyne Pike. Tyler loves books about everyday life and the moments that rupture its routine to surprise, delight, frustrate, reroute, and renew our humanity and bend toward hope. He seeks out fiction and nonfiction that imagines otherwise and other ways of being in the world. In fiction, he enjoys writing about place, family, desire, and time in playful or inventive ways. Tyler values nonfiction that centers the voices and subjects of those who live in the margins of the social, political, and cultural mainstream, especially queer and trans folks. Also, he is interested in literary criticism and essays, data collection and its uses, and everything about tennis. Tyler has a Ph.D. in American Literature from Marquette University. He has held teaching positions at Dartmouth College, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, and Seton Hall University. He lives in Manhattan with his partner and their cat and dog."
