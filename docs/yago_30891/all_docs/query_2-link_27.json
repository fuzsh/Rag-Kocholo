        "text": "Book Links: May 2000 (v.9 no.5)\n\nby Mary Northrup\n\nThe story of Cinderella, perhaps the best-known fairy tale, is told or read to children of very young ages. But Cinderella is not just one story; more than 500 versions have been found—just in Europe! The tale’s origins appear to date back to a Chinese story from the ninth century, “Yeh-Shen.” Almost every culture seems to have its own version, and every storyteller his or her tale. Charles Perrault is believed to be the author, in the 1690s, of our “modern” 300-year-old Cinderella, the French Cendrillon.\n\nFamous children's writers and illustrators have interpreted Cinderella, including Arthur Rackham, Marcia Brown (her version won the Caldecott Medal in 1955), Nonny Hogrogian, Paul Galdone, and Amy Ehrlich. Most renderings of the story include an evil stepmother and stepsister(s), a dead mother, a dead or ineffective father, some sort of gathering such as a ball or festival, mutual attraction with a person of high status, a lost article, and a search that ends with success.\n\nMale Cinderellas do appear, and not just in parodies, such as Helen Ketteman’s\n\nBubba the Cowboy Prince and Sandi Takayama’s\n\nSumorella, listed below. Billy Beg of Ireland is just one of many of these versions of the story.\n\nCinderella, despite her popularity, has developed a reputation as a simpering, whimpering girl who is helpless until the right magic comes along. But this is the Cinderella of the later twentieth century. The earlier Cinderella, in many of her original forms, was not a wishing-only kind of person. She was self-reliant, devoted to family and ancestors, and willing to make her own future.\n\nThe following list concentrates on picture books, but novels based on the Cinderella theme do exist. For a recent example, see\n\nElla Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine (HarperCollins, 1997). The grade levels are suggestions only, as many fairy tale picture books have sophisticated illustrations, allowing them to be used with older students.\n\nAfrica\n\nClimo, Shirley.\n\nThe Egyptian Cinderella. Illus. by Ruth Heller. 1989. 32p. HarperCollins, $15 (0-690-04822-X); paper, $5.95(0-06-443279-3).\n\nK–Gr. 3. Rhodopis, a Greek slave girl living in Egypt, is teased by the servants about her coloring. Eventually, one of her rosy-gold slippers is carried to the pharaoh's court. He searches for, and finds, the girl. Based partly on fact (a slave named Rhodopis did marry Pharaoh Amasis) and partly on folk legends, this story is remarkable for its details of life in ancient Egypt and for the Egyptian-style illustrations. An endnote distinguishes historical background from the influences of other folktales and legends in shaping this tale.\n\nOnyefulu, Obi.\n\nChinye: A West African Folk Tale. Illus. by Evie Safarewicz. 1994. 32p. Viking, $14.99 (0-670-85115-9); Puffin, paper, $5.99 (0-14-055760-11). K–Gr. 3. The mistreated stepdaughter Chinye passes through the forest to gather water unharmed by animals and helped by an old woman. Her wise choice, and her stepsister's bad one, bring about a happy ending in this sensitively told tale with a message.\n\nPhumla.\n\nNomi and the Magic Fish: A Story from Africa. Illus. by Carole Byard. 1972. 32p. Doubleday, o.p. K–Gr. 3. Nomi is a Zulu girl, treated cruelly by her stepmother and stepsister. A fish feeds the girl and is killed by the stepmother.

Illus. by David Shannon. 1992. 32p. Putnam, $15.95 (0-399-21859-9); paper, $5.99 (0-698- 11626-7). Preschool–Gr. 3. A young Indian girl, whose face and hands have been burnt from tending the fire, wishes to marry the Invisible Being. Tested by his sister, she alone of all the village maidens is found worthy.

Illus. by Ed Young. 1996. 32p. Little, Brown, $16.95 (0-316-71314-7). Preschool–Gr. 3. An orphan girl who herds turkeys is rewarded for her kindness with beautiful clothes for a sacred dance.

An author’s note includes information on the collector of many Zuni folktales.\n\nSan Souci, Robert D.\n\nSootface: An Ojibwa Cinderella Story. Illus. by Daniel San Souci. 1994. 32p. Dell, paper, $6.99 (0-440-41363-X). Preschool–Gr. 3. This tale features a girl who is overworked by her sisters and who wishes to meet the invisible warrior. Because of her goodness and inner vision she sees him and becomes his bride. This retelling is not as dark a story as Martin's telling. It also includes notes on the versions of the tale the author consulted.\n\nOther American Cultures\n\nCompton, Joanne.\n\nAshpet: An Appalachian Tale. Illus. by Kenn Compton. 1994. 40p. Holiday, $15.95 (0-8234-1106-0). Preschool–Gr. 3. In this version, the maiden is a hired girl who works for Widow Hooper and her daughters Myrtle and Ethel. Ashpet, with a new calico dress and shoes courtesy of a magical granny, encounters the doctor's son at a church meeting. Humorous illustrations and local (mountain) color make for a delightful story. An author’s note traces the path from the Grimm brothers’ character Aschenputtel to a more modern Ashpet.\n\nDomitila: A Cinderella Tale from the Mexican Tradition. Adapted by Jewell Reinhart Coburn. Illus. by Connie McLennan. 2000. 32p. Shen’s, $16.95 (1-885-00813 9). Preschool–Gr. 3. The emphasis in this story is on Domitila’s accomplishments as a cook and leather artist, skills enhanced by the love her mother taught her to include in every task she undertook. It is her dead mother’s spirit and the legacy of her training on which Domitila depends, not a fairy godmother. The rich young man who searches for her is at first enamoured of Domitila’s cooking, but learns to appreciate and love her deeper qualities.\n\nHayes, Joe.\n\nLittle Gold Star / Estrellita de oro: A Cinderella Cuento Retold in Spanish and English. Illus. by Gloria Osuna Perez and Lucia Angela Perez. 2000. 32p. Cinco Puntos, $15.95 (0-938317-49-0). Preschool–Gr. 5. Storyteller Hayes, in retelling this version of the Cinderella tale, which was brought to the U.S. Southwest by the first Spanish settlers, draws on both the English and Spanish renditions he heard as a child. The heroine, Arcia, is kind to a hawk and receives the reward of a glowing star on her forehead, and, ultimately, the love of the prince, while her stepsisters, who are spiteful and treacherous to the bird, are disfigured.\n\nHooks, William H.\n\nMoss Gown. Illus. by Donald Carrick. 1987. 48p. Houghton, paper, $6.95 (0-395-54793-8). K–Gr. 4. From North Carolina comes the story of Candace, who is banished from her father's house. Aided by a witch-woman who gives her a moss gown, she finds work and eventually love with the master of the house.

Illus. by Brian Pinkney. 1998. 40p. Simon & Schuster, $16 (0-689-80668-X). K–Gr. 4. Told by the godmother of Cendrillon, this story is deeply intertwined with Caribbean culture. All of the familiar elements—wicked stepmother, mean stepsister, carriage, gown, and lost slipper—are here, but they are perked with the color and spice of the islands. A glossary of Creole words and a note documenting the origins of the tale and the point of view adopted in this retelling are included.\n\nSchroeder, Alan.\n\nSmoky Mountain Rose: An Appalachian Cinderella. Illus. by Brad Sneed. 1997. 32p. Dial, $14.99 (0-8037-1733-4). K–Gr. 4. Told in dialect, this is the story of Rose, who must contend with stepmother Gertie and her daughters, Annie and Liza Jane. With the help of a hog, Rose makes it to the big party and catches the eye of the “rich feller.” The derivation of this take on the Cinderella story, as well as folktale collections where similar versions may be found, is documented in the author’s note.\n\nAsia\n\nClimo, Shirley.\n\nThe Korean Cinderella. Illus. by Ruth Heller. 1993. 48p. HarperCollins, $15 (0-06-020432-X); paper, $5.95 (0-06-443397-8). K–Gr. 3. Pear Blossom must perform impossible tasks for her stepmother, such as filling a leaky water jar and polishing grains of rice. She succeeds with the help of a frog and birds. A magistrate who notices her on the road traces her to her house using her sandal. Illustrations inspired by temple patterns enliven the book. Notes by both the author and the illustrator illuminate some of the cultural references in the story.\n\nCoburn, Jewell Reinhart.\n\nAngkat: The Cambodian Cinderella. Illus. by Edmund Flotte. 1998. 32p. Shen’s, $16.95 (1-885008-09-0). Gr. 1–3. Capturing the flavor of the culture, this Southeast Asian tale has a quiet beauty in text and image and includes many recurrent themes. Having helped a fish, the mistreated child of the ashes is helped by the Spirit of Virtue in overcoming a plot against her forged by her wicked stepmother. In this variant, it is a stolen slipper that leads the prince to Angkat.\n\nCoburn, Jewell Reinhart, and Tzexa Cherta Lee.\n\nJouanah: A Hmong Cinderella. Illus. by Anne Sibley O'Brien. 1996. 32p. Shen's, $15.95 (1-885008-01-5). Gr. 2–6. A beautiful young girl is helped by a gentle cow that is really the girl’s mother. The son of the village elder finds Jouanah and her missing shoe and rescues her from a cruel stepmother and stepsister.

Illus. by Oki S. Han. 1996. 32p. Dial, $14.99 (0-8037-1571-4). Preschool–Gr. 3. Kongi works hard for her stepmother and her stepsister, Potgi.
