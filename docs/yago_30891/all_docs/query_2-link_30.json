        "text": "A Lightning Talk is where you give a brief presentation to hit on the main points of an idea and express what matters most. Don't plan to read a speech or essay in its entirety. Be selective, condensing your talk to its essentials.\n\nLightning Talk Guidelines\n\nTime\n\nWhen you submitted your proposal, you indicated your preferences for a one-hour time slot. About a week prior to the festival, you will be notified of your presentation time (15-minute window in that hour). Please arrive 5 minutes prior to your presentation time.\n\nFormat\n\nPowerPoint slides or other computer files can be projected on a laptop computer that will be set up prior to your presentation. PowerPoint is not required. Bring your computer and bring the file with you on a flash drive or email it to yourself.\n\nLength\n\nEach presenter has 15 minutes, including time for questions & answers. Plan to speak no longer than 10 minutes. Please honor your time constraints in order to facilitate the presentations that precede or follow yours.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe most successful lightning talks show evidence of preparation, organization, enthusiasm and confidence. Avoid speaking too rapidly or too quietly. Remember to relax and breathe. For best results, practice your talk and ask a friend to time you.\n\nWatch a Video on Lightning Talks\n\nA poster is a way to presents the result of your project visually, demonstrating your goals, methods and conclusions. Your poster should be self-explanatory, leaving you free to answer questions on the finer details of the project. Poster sessions are scheduled for two-hour blocks.\n\nGuidelines for Creating a SPARC Festival Poster\n\nLocation and Time\n\nPoster sessions last two hours and take place in Patriot Hall. You'll need to arrive 15 minutes early to set up.\n\nFormat\n\nDesign your poster so that it can be tacked onto a 4 foot by 4-foot corkboard. Pushpins will be available. You may use PowerPoint to design a 4 x 4 poster that can be printed in the Center for Instructional Technology and tacked onto the mounting board or design a series of slides (letter-sized or smaller) that can be individually printed and tacked onto the mounting board. You may supplement your poster with a laptop presentation, though access to electric outlets will be limited. If you include audio, keep the volume to a reasonable level.\n\nContent\n\nPresent sufficient evidence to support your conclusions, and use illustrations, plots, small tables, or other visually-appealing content over text. If your project was initially in narrative form, then select representative excerpts. Limit yourself to four or five pages of text in a large font legible from a four-foot distance.\n\nContext\n\nProvide background on your goals, methods, and conclusions. What is the underlying question, why is it important, what is the timeline, who were the participants, what activities went into the research, what conclusion did you reach? Share enough information to allow observers to respond with informed questions.\n\nClarity\n\nSequence items on your poster in an intuitive way that allows observers to readily understand your project. Use left-to-right, top-to-bottom organization and include letters or arrows if necessary. Feature major points, leaving other findings for informal conversations with SPARC attendees. Provide clear labels for each section of your presentation. Use color to enhance comprehension.\n\nTitle and names\n\nChoose a descriptive, catchy title. Include the names of the presenters.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSimplicity is key. Don't try to cover too much material. Say a lot about a little rather than a little about a lot. Rehearse a brief summary of your project. Before you make your poster, create a list of the visuals you would include if you were describing your project with only the visuals. Write the text after you have created the list of visuals.\n\nExamples\n\nFor examples of poster sessions from previous SPARC festivals, visit our Facebook page.\n\nWatch a Video on Poster Presentations\n\nLocation: Laughlin Auditorium\n\n6 p.m. | Suzanna Martin\n\nAn Alternative Method of Total Vitamin 25(OH)D Quantification Using RP-UV in a Finger-prick Blood Sample\n\nBiochemistry | Mentor: Kaitlyn E.
