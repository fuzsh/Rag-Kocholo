In 2013 he returned a final time to make an appearance on Prospect Park’s online reboot of the series.\n\nIn 2004 the actor received a lifetime achievement award at the Daytime Emmys.\n\nAs well as his enduring career on All My Children, MacDonnell played Philip Capice for eight years on CBS soap The Edge of Night from 1961-1969, while he also starred as M. Lindsay Woolsey on Broadway in Mame with both Angela Lansbury and Ann Miller in the late 60s.\n\nHe retired from acting full-time in 2009.\n\nFans paid tribute to the actor on social media, with one writing on Twitter: ‘Oh, I am so sad. I loved Joe Martin! Ray MacDonnell seemed like he’d be a great dad, grandpa, neighbor, friend. May he rest in peace, and may all who love him find comfort in happy memories of him. (sic)’\n\nAnother added of his work: ‘Such a fine actor and lovely man. I was mesmerized by his work as Phil Capice on The Edge Of Night. (sic)’\n\nMusing on the effect his character had on All My Children, one fan wrote: ‘When the word patriarch feels like not strong enough to describe his significance.’\n\nMacDonnell is survived by his three children, Kyle, Daniel, and Sarah, and his wife, Patricia.\n\nMORE : Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will reopen as one show on Broadway"
