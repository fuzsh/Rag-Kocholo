        "text": "The Pentateuch, together with Joshua, Judges and Ruth, with which it is usually united in Greek MSS., makes up the Octateuch; the Pentateuch and Joshua together have recently been named the Hexateuch.\n\nIn its present form this episode appears to be not very ancient; it resembles Ruth in giving a good deal of curious archaeological detail (the feast at Shiloh) in a form which suggests that the usages referred to were already obsolete when the narrative was composed.\n\nThe book, which is post-exilic, may therefore be grouped with another Midrash, the Book of Ruth, which also appears to represent a current of thought opposed to the exclusive spirit of Jewish legalism.\n\nCalled to Paris in 1640 to assist Le Jay in the preparation of his polyglot Bible, he contributed to that work the Arabic and Latin versions of the book of Ruth and the Arabic version of the third book of Maccabees.\n\nBut the Septuagint appends the book to Jeremiah (Baruch intervening), just as it adds Ruth to Judges; thus making the number of the books of the Hebrew Canon the same as that of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, viz.\n\nAt last, in August 1905, the long and mysterious silence was broken by the announcement that a son had been born to Pigott by his \"spiritual wife,\" Miss Ruth Preece, an inmate of the Agapemone.\n\nBut although it was very natural that a later rearrangement should transfer Ruth from the Hagiographa to the historical books, and place it between Judges and Samuel, no motive can be suggested for the opposite change, and the presumption is that it found a place in the last part of the Jewish canon after the second (with the historical books) had been definitely closed.\n\nThe other major families that make up the heart and soul of All My Children include the Chandlers (Adam, his ex-wives, and children), the Martins (Joe, Ruth, and their kids), and the Courtlands (Palmer, Daisy, and their kids).\n\nJune Lockhart played many famous mothers throughout her career including the first Ruth Martin (the mother of little Timmy) on Lassie as well as Dr. Maureen Robinson on the 60s cult hit Lost in Space.\n\nThe main part of the book of Deuteronomy was \"found\" shortly before 621 B.C. and about the same time appeared the prophets Jeremiah and Zephaniah, and perhaps the book of Ruth.\n\nIn the cathedral may be seen the chain ball which killed General St Ruth at the battle of Aughrim, and the spurs which he wore.\n\nIt was occupied in very early times, though the references in Judges xvii., xix., and Ruth' are of doubtful date.\n\nThe story of Ruth (the Moabitess, great-grandmother of David) is one of the Old Testament Hagiographa and is usually reckoned as the second of the five Megilloth (Festal Rolls).\n\nThat the book of Ruth did not originally form part of the series of \"Former Prophets\" (Joshua - Kings) is further probable from the fact that it is quite untouched by the process of \"prophetic\" or \"Deuteronomistic\" editing, which helped to give that series its present shape after the fall of the kingdom of Judah.\n\nNow it appears that Boaz combines the essential duty of the goel in purchasing the estate over which Naomi holds rights, and at the same time marries, not Naomi, who is now old, but her daughter-in-law Ruth, in order to perpetuate her husband's family.\n\nTell is represented as being one of those who swore at the Ruth to drive out the oppressors; but the narrative of his doings is merely one incident in the general movement which began quite independently of him.\n\nTell is the chief of the Ruth leaguers, and it is his deed which is the immediate occasion of the rising against the oppressors, which is dated in 1296.\n\nLater writers added a few more particulars, - that Tell lived at Burglen and fought at Morgarten (1598), that he was the son-in-law of Furst and had two sons (early 18th century), &c. Johannes von Muller (1780) gave a vivid description of the oath at the Ruth by the three (Tell not being counted in), and threw Tschudi's version into a literary form, adding one or two names and adopting that of Hermann for Gessler, calling him of \"Bruneck.\""
