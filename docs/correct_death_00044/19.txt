MUNCY – The West Branch Chorale will swing into spring with the music of singer/dancer Fred Astaire. Born 1889 in Omaha, Nebraska, Astaire pursued a film career and was regarded by many as ‘the greatest popular music dancer of all times.’ Although he had several partners, Ginger Rogers was the most notable.

Astaire received a Grammy and Academy Award, and in 1949 was winner of an Honorary Oscar. In 1978, just nine years prior to his death, he was honored at the Kennedy Center. Some of his most memorable files were “The Easter Parade” (1948) and in 1953 coupled with Cyd Charisse, “Dancing in the Dark” was cited as his greatest film.

Despite many accolades, Astaire remained as modest and elegant as his characters. In a 1959 autobiography he said, “I have no desire to prove anything by it, I just dance.” Astaire died in Los Angeles on Jun 22, 1987.

All concert goers will receive a pen with Astaire’s name and that of the West Branch Chorale. Director Shirley Smith will provide bags of the dancer’s memorabilia, photos, magazines, and videos, all determined by numbers on the program bulletins.

The first half of the concert will contain hymns and contemporary music including a medley of “Old Time Religion.” Accompanying will be pianist Joy Barto.

Concerts are free and open to the public and both will be held at the same site, Pleasant View Wesleyan Church at 994 East Penn Street, Muncy, PA. Concerts will begin at 3 p.m. on Sunday, April 28 and again on May 5, 2019.
