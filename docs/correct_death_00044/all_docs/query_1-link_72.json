        "text": "On the face it, a bill under consideration in the California Assembly that would protect deceased celebrities from commercial exploitation is a reasonable and respectful approach to the handling of such legacies.\n\nBut opponents of Senate Bill 209, who include the major studios and networks, insist that the new law would destroy their ability to express themselves creatively and use the likenesses of stars long dead.\n\nOf particular concern, in this age of digital technology, is a proposed restriction on the use of computers to alter images of celebs. The restriction is aimed at counteracting the growing custom of creating scenarios in which deceased people are shown doing or saying things that are digitally devised.\n\n“A film like ‘Forrest Gump’ could not have been made because the creators would have to get permission from the heirs of JFK, LBJ, Nixon and all the other deceased personalities that Forrest encounters,” the Motion Picture Assn. of America said in a position paper on SB 209, which the state Senate nonetheless approved 30-1 on April 5.\n\n“Even footage of a live person portraying a deceased personality could not be digitally altered or manipulated under this legislation. Any digital alteration or manipulation of Madonna as Evita Peron would be prohibited without Peron’s heirs’ permission,” the position paper asserted.\n\n‘Egregious infringements’\n\nThe bill was prompted by dance great Fred Astaire’s widow, Robyn, after she discovered what she called “egregious infringements” of her late husband’s legacy, including the use of his face on a condom package and a video that advertised, “Fred Astaire teaches you how to dirty dance.”\n\n“The families of almost every prominent person who has contributed something unique to society have the same problem,” Astaire said.\n\nCurrent California law requires someone who wants to use a dead celebrity’s name, voice or likeness in a commercial product to get permission first from survivors, although there are exceptions for films, plays, books, magazines, music, works of art, radio and television programs and material that has a political or news value.\n\nClosing loopholes\n\nThe new legislation aims to close those loopholes, and would force a producer being sued by heirs to prove that the use of a dead celebrity’s image was covered by the First Amendment.\n\nIt would also extend the law to apply to material produced within 70 years of a celebrity’s death — up from the current 50 — and allow heirs to sue in California even if the celebrity did not live here.\n\nVans Stevenson, a senior veep at the MPAA who specializes in legislative issues, said freedom of expression would be curtailed by placing “control in the heirs’ hands.”\n\nIt’s obvious, he said, that Gump, in an Oscar-winning performance by Tom Hanks, “id not actually speak to John Kennedy or John Lennon — he’s a fictional character.”\n\nBy the same token, Stevenson said, “Oliver Stone had a vision about history, but it was clearly fiction when he did ‘JFK.’ ”\n\nStevenson said Astaire does not understand “the serious negative impact” the law could have on movie and TV productions as well as on publication of magazines and books.\n\nThe MPAA’s position paper said a docudrama like HBO’s “From the Earth to the Moon” would be threatened by the legislation “because it is a mixture of real personalities in a factual but not historically perfect story.” The families of the late astronauts Gus Grissom and Ed White, for instance, “would have control over their portrayal.”\n\nWho may be liable\n\nFrom the MPAA’s point of view, video retailers, theater owners, bookstores “and even the neighborhood newsstand” could be liable if they sell or distribute materials that contain unauthorized images.\n\nAnne Noble Ervine, a Washington lawyer representing the Magazine Publishers of America, suggested in a June 8 letter to Assembly Judiciary Committee chair Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) that lucre was at the root of the Astaire bill. Magazines cannot be effective, Ervine said, if they are hampered by measures that “effectively promote censorship in service to the monetary desires of the heirs of deceased celebrities.”\n\nErvine stressed that magazine publishers are “not unsympathetic to the legitimate claims by heirs of deceased celebrities not to have their forebears sullied by their unsanctioned reproduction on coffee mugs or, as Mrs. Astaire suggested … on condoms.”\n\nBut currently law, Ervine said, “already prohibits such exploitation.”\n\nThe bill, which goes before the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July 14, was authored by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco).\n\nBurden of proof\n\n“Under this bill, playwrights, biographers, composers and various other creative folk would now have the burden of proving that their work falls under the First Amendment protection,” screenwriter and novelist Michael B. Druxman wrote in a June 24 letter to friends. “Although the vast majority would probably prevail in the end, how many of these struggling artists could afford the legal costs to defend their position?”\n\nAn army of lawyers — 22 of them — showed up at an Assembly Judiciary Committee meeting on June 22 to express industry opposition to the bill. Astaire had four people with her, including actress Janet Leigh and SAG’s legislative expert, Catherine York. The measure nonetheless passed by an 11-1 vote.\n\n“This is a classic case of corporate conglomerates vs. the individual,” York said. “The long list of companies represented in opposition — like Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony, ABC, CBS and NBC — are owned by just six or seven major corporations.”\n\nThomas White, an intellectual property expert acting as a consultant to Astaire, said the bill would ensure that producers “can’t portray it as true when it isn’t.”\n\n“What the heirs object to is being used without a factual basis solely to create a more commercial, sexier or higher-profile project,” White said. “The heirs don’t object to the unvarnished truth, even if it’s unflattering.”\n\nAstaire, whose husband died in 1987, said she was “astonished by the false accusations and misinformation that have been deliberately disseminated by opponents to prejudice legislators and the public.”\n\nCelebrity support\n\nShe said “hundreds of artists,” including Jack Lemmon, Muhammad Ali, Bob Hope, Nancy Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, “strongly support our bill.”\n\nAstaire called absurd the charge that films such as “Forrest Gump” would not be made if the bill becomes law.\n\n“There is no constitutional right to lie,” she said. “If a person knowingly portrays false statements as true — and damages the commercial value of another person’s property rights — they should be held accountable for the harm they cause.”"
