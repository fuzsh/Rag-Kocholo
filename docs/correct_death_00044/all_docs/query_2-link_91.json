        "text": "Fred Astaire dies\n\n1987 - Fred Astaire, who danced his way across the screen to become a film legend, died of pneumonia at the age of 88. In his later years, he built a second career as a character actor. But he will be remembered for his stylish dancing, with his bewildering array of intricate steps, that made him one of Hollywoodâ€™s major box office attractions for 35 years. With his dancing came a thin, clipped but catchy singing voice and a light-hearted sense of humour. He gave millions of people far from the big cities their first taste of professional dancing, paving the way for dancers like Gene Kelly. Astaire was born Frederick Austerlitz on May 10, 1899, in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Anna Austerlitz, launched Astaire and his elder sister, Adele, on a dancing career.\n\nJune 22\n\n1865 - English cricketer W.G.
