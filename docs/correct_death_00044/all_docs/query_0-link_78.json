        "meta_description": "FRED ASTAIRE was widely considered as the 'greatest dancer' in the history of film, so his death at the age of 88 back in 1987 was a disappointment for many. The star entertained thousands in various films such as Top Hat and Swing Time, but in the end it was a short battle with pneumonia that led to the end of his life.",

        "text": "Although there are various different causes of pneumonia (Johns Hopkins Medicine states there are more than 30), the most common cause is community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nThis is when pneumonia affects somebody who is not already in hospital, and is caused by a bacterium known as Streptococcus pneumoniae. It usually occurs when the body is weakened in some way, such as by illness, poor nutrition, old age, or impaired immunity, and the bacteria are able to work their way into the lungs.\n\nIn addition, when young infants or individuals older than 65 years of age, the condition is most serious.\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is much less contagious than flu or a cold, because most people’s immune systems can kill the bacteria that causes it before they can cause an infection.\n\nOther types of community-acquired pneumonia include:\n\nHospital-acquired pneumonia - the condition develops when individuals are in hospital\n\nViral pneumonia - common causes include the flu.\n\nAspiration pneumonia - the condition is caused by food going down the wrong way or inhaling vomit and other harmful substances.\n\nFungal pneumonia - a rare form in the UK caused by fungi.\n\nDue to the potentially serious nature of the condition, it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms. Most commonly these include:\n\nChest pain when you breathe or cough\n\nConfusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)\n\nCough, which may produce phlegm\n\nFatigue\n\nFever, sweating and shaking chills\n\nLower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)\n\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhoea\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nIn order to receive a proper diagnosis and necessary treatment, individuals will need to see a medical professional. This usually involves a chest examination and an X-ray in order to distinguish between pneumonia and a chest infection.\n\nDue to the severity of the condition it is important to get treatment quickly. Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia that you have, but in most cases can be treated at home using antibiotics.\n\nOther possible treatments may include eating well, increasing fluid intake, getting rest, oxygen therapy, pain medicine, fever control, and cough-relief medicine if the individual’s cough is particularly severe.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic explains that for those in “high-risk” groups - children two years old or younger and people aged 65 and over - complications of the condition can develop, even with treatment.\n\nThese complications can include the following:\n\nBacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia). Bacteria that enter the bloodstream from your lungs can spread the infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.\n\nDifficulty breathing. If your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic underlying lung diseases, you may have trouble breathing in enough oxygen. You may need to be hospitalised and use a breathing machine (ventilator) while your lung heals."
