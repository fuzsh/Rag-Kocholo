I didn't know how to fall. I didn't know how to get down on a table - I didn't know how to save myself because I was never a classic dancer,\" she told the Miami Herald in 2016.\n\nPaige would go on to appear in a string of movies in the 1960s, including the Hope comedy Bachelor In Paradise, the Doris Day comedy Please Don't Eat The Daisies and the Richard Thorpe-directed film Follow The Boys.\n\nShe also supplied glamour for Hope's Christmas visits to US troops in Cuba and the Caribbean in 1960, Japan and South Korea in 1962, and Vietnam in 1964.\n\nPaige also sang in clubs with Sammy Davis Jr, Alan King, Dinah Shore and Perry Como.\n\nIn 1968, she replaced Angela Lansbury in the New York production of Mame on Broadway and toured with the show in 1969. She also toured in Gypsy, Annie Get Your Gun, Born Yesterday and The Desk Set.\n\nHer last time on Broadway was in 1984's Alone Together.\n\nIn May 2003, Paige resumed entertaining after a long absence.

He was big and strong, and I began to fight, kick, bite and scream,\" she wrote. \"At 95, time is not on my side, and neither is silence. I simply want to add my name and say, 'Me too'.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nThe actress, who grew up in Tacoma, Washington, was born Donna May Tjaden but adopted her grandfather's name of Paige.\n\nShe took her first name from Elsie Janis, famed for entertaining troops in the First World War.\n\nPaige had two brief marriages, to San Francisco restaurateur Frank Martinelli and writer-producer Arthur Stander.\n\nIn 1962 she married songwriter Ray Gilbert, who won an Oscar for the song Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Da from Disney's Song Of The South.\n\nHe died in 1976, and she assumed management of his music company."
