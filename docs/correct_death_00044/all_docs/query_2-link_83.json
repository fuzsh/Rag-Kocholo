        "text": "York County has a new studio for ballroom dancing, and the studio is part of a franchise that bears the name of the late legendary actor and dancer, Fred Astaire.\n\nFred Astaire Dance Studio of York has opened at Delco Plaza, 1113 Carlisle Road in West Manchester Township. The studio is located in a new 4,000-square-foot facility which includes 1,700 square feet of dance floor space.\n\nThe studio features ballroom and Latin style dance lessons for all ages and abilities, and is open from noon - 8 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. Saturday.\n\nFred Astaire Dance Studio of York opened in May and is owned by Steven Parker and Tara White Timple. Parker and White Timple met more than a decade ago at a dance studio in Knoxville, Tennessee, when White Timple and her late husband began taking dance lessons at a studio where Parker was teaching. Seven years later, Parker became an instructor and trainer at a dance studio in York County and White Timple signed up to take some of his group classes. When White Timple decided to open the dance studio she asked Parker to join her. He has more than 24 years of experience working in the dance industry.\n\nA grand opening celebration will be held from 5 p.m. - 7 p.m. July 20, and will feature professional dance performances, free beginner dance lessons, and refreshments. A ribbon-cutting will be held at 5:30 p.m. during the grand opening celebration."
