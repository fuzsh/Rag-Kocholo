        "text": "Profession: Actor and Dancer\n\nBiography: Fred Astaire was an American dancer and actor who is widely regarded as one of the most influential dancers in the history of film and television musicals. Astaire transformed the musical genre, turning dance sequences into key narrative elements.\n\nAstaire began his career on the vaudeville stage alongside his older sister, Adele Astaire, as a dancing duo. They achieved significant success, transitioning from the vaudeville circuit to Broadway where they performed in shows such as Lady, Be Good! (1924), Funny Face (1927), and The Band Wagon (1931).\n\nIt was Astaire's move to Hollywood, however, that cemented his legacy. His on-screen partnership with Ginger Rogers at RKO Pictures produced numerous classics, such as Top Hat (1935) Swing Time (1936), and Shall We Dance (1937). Together, they made ten films during the classic age of Hollywood cinema.\n\nWhile best known for his dance routines, Astaire was also a talented vocalist. Songs like The Way You Look Tonight from Swing Time and Puttin' On the Ritz from Blue Skies (1946) became standards, in part due to his memorable renditions.\n\nBorn: May 10, 1899\n\nBirthplace: Omaha, Nebraska, USA\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
