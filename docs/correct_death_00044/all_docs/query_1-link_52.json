        "text": "BLOOMFIELD HILLS – After 11 years owning the largest ballroom dance studio in the state, Fred Astaire Dance Studio Michigan owners Evan and Lada Mountain are opening a second studio in West Bloomfield.\n\nThe new location is in the Drake Shopping Center at 5526 Drake Road, near Walnut Lake. Aubrey Meade will manage the studio. A Warren resident, Meade grew up participating in opera and musical theater, touring as a classical vocalist in China and performing at the 2010 World Expo.\n\nThey’re hosting a grand opening celebration on Friday, Sept. 21 from 7-9 p.m. that the public is welcome to attend.\n\nInstructors include Donald Westphal and Misha Annienkov. A Royal Oak resident, Westphal is assistant manager of the flagship Michigan studio in Bloomfield Hills; he’ll work three days a week at the new location and teach two days a week in Bloomfield Hills. Westphal was a competitive figure skater from a young age and began ballroom dancing in his 20s.\n\nA Waterford resident who hails from Ukraine, Annienkov is a world champion in ballroom who started dancing at the age of six. He has extensive experience dancing around the world and teaching a variety of students, including children and people in wheelchairs. He will teach two days a week at the new studio.\n\nThe expansion comes as Evan and Lada Mountain inked a deal with the Fred Astaire national franchise company to become the only Michigan Area Developers, with sole rights to open Fred Astaire Dance Studios throughout the state.\n\n“We are excited about opening our second studio, in what will be the first of a long line of dance studios across the state,” says Evan Mountain. “We plan to have 10 more studios within the next five years. We’re already in discussions with potential investors and managers about locations in Detroit.”\n\nNine miles from the flagship Fred Astaire studio in Bloomfield Hills, the new West Bloomfield location is sufficiently far enough to draw a new audience from further west suburbs. With two floating dance floor ballrooms, the studio occupies 3,400 square feet, about half the size of the Bloomfield Hills location, which measures 6,500 square feet. The new location was occupied by Geiger Ballet for 30 years.\n\nWhen Mary Geiger decided to retire, the Mountains were delighted to “keep the good karma of a dance studio going in this space.”\n\nPlans for expansion\n\nDuring 2019, the Mountains anticipate expanding their ballroom dance company to include four studios. They are considering locations in Novi, Northville, Ann Arbor and Detroit as well as looking toward West Michigan for future growth.\n\nThey’ve experienced record growth year over year for the past several years, says Evan Mountain. Currently, the Bloomfield Hills location is 20 percent ahead of last year’s numbers, and 2017 sales were the pair’s highest point yet.\n\n“Continued growth just keeps happening at rates that I did not expect,” he says. “I attribute this to the culture we’re building and continue to nurture. New students come in and become dedicated returning students, who then consider participating in competitions, which takes their experience in our community to a whole new level.”\n\nThis year, more than 30 students from the Bloomfield Hills studio have participated in ballroom dance competitions, Mountain notes, adding that they’re on track to become one of the most competitive dance studios in the country.\n\nMountain is known for his marketing expertise and willingness to think outside the box and try new approaches, which he says is one explanation for the company’s growth. Another is the “friendly, inclusive, warm” culture they’ve cultivated.\n\n“People come here and find camaraderie,” he says. “Everything starts with being a friendly, warm studio where people feel comfortable and supported. Plus, it’s fun. Frankly, the growth surprises me, but we’ll keep focusing on it to keep it going.”\n\nAbout Fred Astaire studio\n\nFred Astaire Dance Studio of Michigan includes two studios, one in Bloomfield Hills since 2005, which offers the largest ballroom dance studio in the state of Michigan, and a new location opened in mid-2018 in West Bloomfield. Owned by Evan and Lada Mountain, the studios are part of a nationwide franchise that requires daily training for its teachers, who are dedicated to teaching dance full-time. The Mountains are the Michigan Area Developers for the Fred Astaire franchise, with exclusive rights to open Fred Astaire Dance Studios throughout Michigan.\n\nThe studio‘s mission is to enrich lives by building confidence, connection and community through ballroom dance. Private lessons, group lessons and dance parties are open to the public, featuring students ranging in age from teens to retirees and seniors.\n\nLearn more at fredastaire.com/bloomfield-hills/. The flagship studio is located at 2172 Franklin Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48302, (248) 454-1715. The West Bloomfield studio is located in the Drake Shopping Center at 5526 Drake Road, near Walnut Lake Road."
