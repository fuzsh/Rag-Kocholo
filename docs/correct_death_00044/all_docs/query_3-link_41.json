        "text": "Foteini Pangea was born in Elassona, Greece growing up in the gym of her parents “Fame”. She moved to Larissa, Greece where, starting at the age of 6, she got introduced to a wide range of different dance styles: Ballet, Character, Hip-hop, Oriental, Ballroom, and Latin. As the main member of the undefeated “All Ladies Latin 5 Dance” champions team for 6 years “Bond Girls” gained the experience of the TV show “Greece Got Talent” till the big LIVE finals and every day she loved Ballroom dancing, through competitions and performances more and more not just by being champion & the sport side but also the artistry of it all. Passionate about dance and especially Latin Styles, she started teaching in Larissa, Agia, and Volos from the age of just 16 in many schools and groups & competes with her Youth partner in Greece and representing the country in big tournaments all around Europe. What she loves most about dancing is the amazing impact of the sport in people’s lives and the discovery of the world through dance. That she personally got to experience & travel over 30 different countries and found her dance and life partner through it, Richard Kaszas.\n\nRichard Kaszas started ballroom dancing with his sister at the age of 8 when their mother took them to the dance studio in Debrecen, Hungary. Competing nationally in Ballroom, Latin, and Formation style they decided to join the Romanian “Stephany Dance Club” in Oradea where after 6 months they won the national title & became the champions. They represented that studio nationally and internationally in many European competitions having amazing results in the Youth division. Richard had many tryouts and partners after he and his sister decided to dance with other partners. He found his current partner Foteini Pangea and together they moved, taught, and trained in Romania, Hungary, and Greece, winning national titles & representing the countries in Adult Latin Open Division all around Europe. His strong commitment to sports allowed him, even from a distance, to finish his Bachelor’s Degree in “Sports Management” while practicing 8 hours a day & competing every weekend.\n\nTogether in 2016, they made a decision that changed their life, moving to the USA & working for Fred Astaire Dance Studios. Sharing their passion, love, and knowledge and changing people’s lives through dance, while continuing their competitive career by conquering very high titles. With their “champions mindset” in everything they do they became the Top Male & Top Female teachers of the whole franchise for 4 years in a row and going.
