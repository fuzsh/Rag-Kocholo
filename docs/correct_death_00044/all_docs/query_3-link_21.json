        "text": "Fred Astaire is a brilliant actor, dancer, choreographer, performer of musical works. He made an undeniable contribution to the development of the so-called musical cinema. Fred appeared in dozens of films that today are considered classics.\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nFrederick Austerlitz (real name of the artist) was born on May 10, 1899 in the town of Omaha (Nebraska). The boy's parents had nothing to do with creativity.\n\nThe head of the family worked in one of the largest companies in the city. The company where my father worked specialized in brewing. The mother devoted herself entirely to the upbringing of her children. She spent most of her time with her daughter Adele, who showed great promise in choreography.\n\nThe woman dreamed of creating a duet, which would include her daughter Adele and son Frederick. From a young age, the boy took choreography lessons and learned to play several musical instruments. It was deliberately determined for him that he would occupy his niche in show business, although in his childhood Frederick dreamed of a completely different profession. In the end result, the artist will thank his mother all his life, who showed him the right path.\n\nAdele and Frederic did not attend a comprehensive school. Instead, they went to a dance studio in New York. Then they were listed as students of the Academy of Culture and Arts. The teachers, as one, said that a good future awaits the brother and sister.\n\nSoon the duet was already performing on the professional stage. The guys managed to make an indelible impression on the audience. The audience, as one, was genuinely delighted with what these two were doing. At the same time, the enterprising mother decided to update the surname of her own children. Thus, a more sonorous creative pseudonym Aster appeared.\n\nFred appeared on stage in a tailcoat and a classic black top hat. This image has become a kind of \"chip\" of the artist. In addition, the black top hat helped to significantly stretch the guy in length. Due to his height, the audience often “lost” him, so wearing a headdress saved the situation.\n\nThe creative path of Fred Astaire\n\nIn 1915 the Aster family reappeared on the scene. Now they presented to the public updated numbers that contained elements of the step. By this time, Fred had become a real professional dancer. In addition, he was responsible for staging choreographic numbers.\n\nAstaire experimented with music. At this time, he got acquainted with the works of George Gershwin. He was so impressed by what the maestro was doing that he chose the composer's piece of music for his choreographic number. Accompanied by Over the Top, the Asters blew up the Broadway stage. This event took place in 1917.\n\nAfter a successful return to the stage, the duet in the literal sense of the word woke up popular. The guys received an offer from the lead director to play on a permanent basis in the musical The Passing Show of 1918. Fans were crazy about the musicals Funny Face, It's Good to Be a Lady and The Theater Wagon.\n\nIn the early 30s of the last century, Adele got married. Her husband was categorically against her wife going on stage. The woman devoted herself entirely to the family, although after that she again appeared on the stage. Fred had no choice but to pursue a solo career. He took a landmark in the cinema.\n\nHe failed to gain a foothold in Hollywood. But, for some time he shone on the stage of the theater. The audience especially liked the performance of \"Merry Divorce\", in which Astaire and Claire Luce played the key roles.\n\nFilms featuring Fred Astaire\n\nIn the 30s of the last century, he managed to sign a contract with Metro-Goldwin-Mayer. Surprisingly, the director saw in Astaire what others considered unattractive. After signing the contract, he received a key role in the musical \"Dancing Lady\". The audience, who watched the musical film, was genuinely delighted with Fred's game.\n\nThis was followed by filming in the film \"Flight to Rio\". Fred's partner on the set was the charming Ginger Rogers. Then the pretty actress was not yet familiar to the audience. After the elegant dance of the couple, both partners woke up famous. The directors persuaded Astaire to continue working with Rogers - this couple interacted very well with each other.\n\nUntil the end of the 30s, the incendiary couple appeared on the set together. They delighted the audience with an unsurpassed game. During this time, the actors starred in dozens of films. The directors trusted a couple of roles in musicals.\n\nThe directors said that Astaire eventually turned into an \"intolerable actor.\" He was demanding not only to himself, but also to his partners and the set. Fred rehearsed a lot, and if he did not like the footage, he asked to re-shoot this or that scene.\n\nYears passed, but he did not forget about the occupation that brought him to the big stage. He improved the choreographic data. By that time, Fred was famous as one of the greatest dancers in the world.\n\nIn the early 40s of the last century, he danced in tandem with Rita Hayworth. The dancers managed to reach an absolute mutual understanding. They got along well and charged the audience with positive energy. The couple appeared in several films. We are talking about the films \"You will never be richer\" and \"You have never been more delightful.\"\n\nSoon the dance couple broke up. The artist could no longer find a permanent partner. He collaborated with famous dancers, but, alas, he could not find mutual understanding with them. By that time, he was partially disillusioned with cinema. He wanted new sensations, ups and downs, development. In the mid-40s, he decided to put an end to his career as an actor.\n\nTeaching activity of Fred Astaire\n\nFred was eager to pass on his experience and knowledge to the younger generation. After he put an end to his acting career, Astaire opened a dance studio. Over time, choreographic educational institutions opened in different parts of the world.\n\nBut he soon caught himself thinking that he was bored with the attention of the public. At sunset in the 40s, he returned to the set to star in the Easter Parade film.\n\nAfter some time, he appeared in several more films. He managed to return to the pinnacle of fame and popularity in the early 50s of the last century. It was then that the premiere of the film \"Royal Wedding\" took place. He again bathed in the rays of glory.\n\nAt the moment when he was at the peak of popularity, not the best changes took place on the personal front. He sank into depression. Now Fred was not pleased with either success, or the love of the public, or the recognition of respected film critics. After the death of the official wife, the actor came to his senses for a long time. His health was seriously undermined.\n\nHe was involved in another picture, but commercially, the work turned out to be an absolute failure. A series of troubles pulled Astaire to the very bottom. But he did not lose heart, and calmly went to a well-deserved rest.\n\nIn the end, he had to make the final decision about his departure. Finally, about himself, he recorded a full-length LP \"Aster's Stories\" and also a piece of music \"Cheek to Cheek\". He focused on creating music and dance programs.\n\nDetails of the artist's personal life\n\nDespite the fact that Fred's external data was far from beauty standards, he was always in the center of attention among the fairer sex. He moved in the Hollywood environment, but did not use his position.\n\nHe survived several vivid novels, and in the 33rd year of the last century, Astaire managed to find love. The first official wife of the artist was the charming Phyllis Potter. The woman already had experience of family life. Behind Phyllis was a marriage and one child.\n\nThey lived an incredibly happy life. In this marriage, two children were born. Astaire and Potter have lived together for over 20 years. Despite the fact that Hollywood beauties were interested in Fred, he remained faithful to his wife. For Fred, family and work have always come first. He was not worried about fleeting novels. The actor returned home with great pleasure.\n\nFriends joked that his wife had bewitched him. With her, he was so happy and calm. Alas, but a strong union - destroyed the death of Phyllis. The woman died of lung cancer.\n\nHe was very upset by the death of his first wife. For a while, Fred limited communication with people. The actor refused to work and did not allow women to see him. In the 80s, he married Robin Smith. With this woman he spent the rest of his days.\n\nDeath of Fred Astaire\n\nThroughout his life, the artist carefully monitored his health. He died on June 22, 1987. The information about the death of the great artist shocked the fans, because the man looked just wonderful for his age. His health was crippled by pneumonia.\n\nBefore his death, Fred expressed his gratitude to his family, colleagues and fans. With a separate speech, he turned to Michael Jackson, who was just starting his stellar journey."
