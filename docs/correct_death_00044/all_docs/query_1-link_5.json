        "text": "Fred Astaire is simply incomparable.....there has never been a Hollywood star like him.\n\nFred Astaire is one Hollywood star who you can’t compare to any one of this era….and perhaps not any era. When you compare Fred Astaire to Hollywood stars of today like Vin Diesel and Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnson or Mark Wahlberg you are comparing a candy store to a single piece of candy. Fred Astaire was one of Hollywoods all time most talented and diverse stars, a 3 \"tool talent\"…he could act, he could sing, and to state the obvious, he could dance.\n\nFred Astaire was born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1899 and his show business career started very early when he and his sister Adele started a dancing partnership when Fred was just 6 years old. The Fred and Adele act traveled the country for years and it helped pay the family bills. They were considered by many to be the “best child act on Vaudeville”. They appeared on Broadway together and on the London stage up until 1932 when Adele got married and the partnership ended……Fred, who was starting to outshine his sister…was now on his own.\n\nFred auditioned for a screen test for RKO in 1933 and folklore has it that the screen test read: \"Can't sing. Can't act. Balding. Can dance a little.\"\n\nRKO chief David O. Selznick signed him anyways saying \"I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test.\"\n\nAstaire was soon paired up with Ginger Rodgers, a tactic that he reluctantly agreed to try as he was coming off of a 27 year partnership with his sister.\n\nThey made 9 films together from 1934-1949.\n\nAstaire announced his retirement (temporary) in 1946 but soon reappeared in film to star in “Easter Parade” with Judy Garland. Astaire made his \"last\" musical in 1957 called “Silk Stockings” with Cyd Charisse preferring to focus on serious acting. He made 30 musicals in all over his career and was persuaded by Francis Ford Coppola to do one final musical at the age of 69; the 1968 film, “Finian’s Rainbow”.\n\nAstaire continued to act and sing and choreograph into his early eighties…\n\nHis second marriage came in 1980 to professional horse jockey, Robyn Smith, 45 years his junior.\n\nHe was named the fifth Greatest Male Star of Old Hollywood by the American Film Institute. As a dancer, he is best remembered for his sense of rhythm and his legendary perfectionism.\n\nGene Kelly, another major innovator in filmed dance, said that \"the history of dance on film begins with Astaire\n\nShortly before his death, Astaire said: \"I didn't want to leave this world without knowing who my descendant was, thank you Michael\"—referring to Michael Jackson\n\nAstaire's life has never been portrayed on film. He always refused permission for such portrayals, saying, \"However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell.\" Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, \"It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be.\n\nFred Astaire died of pneumonia in 1987 and is buried in Chatsworth, California."
