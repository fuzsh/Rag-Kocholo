        "text": "Fred Astaire (May 10, 1899 – June 22, 1987) was an American dancer, choreographer, actor, and singer. He is widely considered the greatest dancer in film history.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in Omaha, Nebraska, to Johanna (Geilus) and Fritz Austerlitz, a brewer. Astaire studied dancing from the age of four, and in 1906 he formed an act with his sister, Adele, that became a popular vaudeville attraction. The two made their Broadway debut in Over the Top (1917–18). They achieved international fame with stage hits that included For Goodness Sake (1922), Funny Face (1927–28), and The Band Wagon (1931–32).\n\nAmong their many productions the brother-sister team starred in the 1927 George and Ira Gershwin musical Funny Face. For all his early success, though, career in the movies eluded Astaire. He had done a screen test, but he failed to attract any interest. A studio executive wrote at the time, \"Can't sing. Can't act. Slightly balding. Can dance a little.\"\n\nIn 1932, Astaire had a career setback as his sister retired from the act to marry a British aristocrat. He floundered a bit professionally without his usual partner, but then decided to go to Hollywood to try once more to break into film. Astaire soon landed a small role in 1933's Dancing Lady with Joan Crawford. The role opened the door to new opportunities, and Astaire signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures. Astaire was teamed up with another Broadway star Ginger Rogers. Astaire and Rogers appeared in several more films together, including The Gay Divorcee (1934) and Top Hat (1935). The duo became film's most beloved dance team. Their routines featured a hybrid of styles—borrowing elements from tap, ballroom and even ballet. Katharine Hepburn once described what each of them brought their successful partnership: \"Fred gave Ginger class, and Ginger gave Fred sex. Astaire was known for his relentless pursuit of perfection. He would rehearse on a scene for days. The pair went their separate ways after 1939's The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle. Years later, they reunited once more for 1949's The Barkleys of Broadway. During these years, he was also active in recording and radio.\n\nAstaire revolutionized dance on film by having complete autonomy over its presentation. He is credited with two important innovations in early film musicals. First, he insisted that a closely tracking dolly camera film a dance routine in as few shots as possible, typically with just four to eight cuts, while holding the dancers in full view at all times. This gave the illusion of an almost stationary camera filming an entire dance in a single shot. Astaire famously quipped: \"Either the camera will dance, or I will.\" Astaire maintained this policy from The Gay Divorcee in 1934 until his last film musical Finian's Rainbow in 1968, when director Francis Ford Coppola overruled him.\n\nAstaire surprised his audiences by announcing his retirement during the production of his next film Blue Skies (1946). He nominated \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" as his farewell dance. After announcing his retirement in 1946, Astaire concentrated on his horse-racing interests and in 1947 founded the Fred Astaire Dance Studios, which he subsequently sold in 1966.\n\nAstaire returned to the big screen to replace Gene Kelly who injure himself on set of in Easter Parade (1948). He would star alongside Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford. He followed up with a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Astaire would star in more films and more musicals through 1957. As his movie roles tapered off, Astaire worked more in television. He often appeared as himself for special tribute shows. Astaire had a growing interest in dramatic parts, working on such series as Dr. Kildare. He also worked with another legendary dancer, Gene Kelly, on the documentary That's Entertainment, which explored the golden era of the movie musical.\n\nAstaire received his only Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in the 1974 disaster film The Towering Inferno. He also won an Emmy Award for his work on the television special A Family Upside Down in 1978. More accolades soon followed. Astaire received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1981.\n\nAstaire died of pneumonia on June 22, 1987, at the age of 88. His body was buried at Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California.\n\nAlthough he viewed himself primarily as an entertainer, his artistry won him the admiration of twentieth-century dancers such as Gene Kelly, George Balanchine, the Nicholas Brothers, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Margot Fonteyn, Bob Fosse, Gregory Hines, Rudolf Nureyev, Michael Jackson, and Bill Robinson. Balanchine compared him to Bach, describing him as \"the most interesting, the most inventive, the most elegant dancer of our times\", while for Baryshnikov he was \"a genius ... a classical dancer like I never saw in my life.\" He concluded, \"No dancer can watch Fred Astaire and not know that we all should have been in another business.\"\n\n“Oh, God! That boy moves in a very exceptional way. That’s the greatest dancer of the century”.-Fred Astaire on seeing Michael Jackson dancing.\n\n“I didn’t want to leave this world without knowing who my descendant was. Thank you Michael!”-Fred Astaire on Michael Jackson\n\nGallery[]"
