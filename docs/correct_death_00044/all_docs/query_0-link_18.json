        "text": "When you picture Fred Astaire, it is likely to be in his prime, as a 1930s film star, flashing a warm smile, dressed in top hat and tails and moving with a dazzling light-footed grace across a ballroom floor.\n\nThere is a less well known image for one of the greatest dancers of the 20th century: that of a 77-year-old man, dressed in trousers and a casual shirt, flying across his Beverly Hills courtyard on a skateboard. The sport became a passion for Astaire in the mid-1970s, after his dancing days had finished. But his skateboarding craze ended only after he suffered a painful, embarrassing fall from his board. The star, whose dancing often made him appear superhuman, broke his left wrist and had to wear a cast for six weeks.\n\nAstaire was born Frederick Austerlitz on May 10 1899, the son of an Austrian brewery worker. Fritz Austerlitz decided to Anglicize the family name when he emigrated to Omaha, Nebraska in the late 19th century. Fred Astaire, like his sister Adele, always seemed to have wonderful natural balance and his mother Johanna sent him for ballet lessons at the age of four.\n\nAfter making his name as a brilliant teenage tap-dancer, on Broadway and in London, Astaire finally hit the big time in Hollywood despite a lukewarm screen test report which said: “Can't act. Slightly bald. Also dances”. RKO Studios took a gamble on Astaire which paid off spectacularly. He starred in more than 30 musicals between 1933 and 1968. Eleven of these co-starred Ginger Rogers, his most celebrated dancing partner.\n\nAstaire was a perfectionist and had practised non-stop for six decades to elevate his dancing into a special realm of brilliance. When he turned 70, he decided it was time to stop dancing professionally. ''I don't want to be the oldest performer in captivity. At this age, it's ridiculous. I don't want to look like a little old man dancing out there,'' he told The New York Times.\n\nHe continued his acting career, however, and was nominated for an Oscar in 1975, for his supporting role as con-man Harlee Claiborne in the disaster movie The Towering Inferno. When he was not working on a movie, he was a quiet creature of habit. He woke at 5am every day and always had the same breakfast: a single boiled egg, a diet designed to keep his weight at a perpetual 134 pounds.\n\nThe man who had been a widower since 1954, when 46-year-old Phyllis died of lung cancer, was becoming a restless OAP, unwilling to just while away time watching his favourite day-time soaps, The Guiding Light and As the World Turns.\n\nWhen Astaire’s grandchildren showed him their skateboards, he decided he would try one for himself. He was still fit – he had his own tennis court and played regularly – and was sure that his wonderful sense of balance would hold him in good stead. He remembered how he and Rogers had seemed to defy gravity when they performed a complicated dance routine on roller skates in the 1937 film Shall We Dance. Astaire loved his new hobby. He talked positively about skateboarding on the Merv Griffiths television show and his enthusiasm for the sport was reported in the new Skateboarder Magazine. Astaire said he \"exercised daily\" on his board.\n\nOn Monday 16 August 1976, he finished filming for The Amazing Dobermans, a movie that featured family members in minor roles. The following day, some of his family went to his home in Beverley Hills for a celebratory lunch. It seems that Astaire wanted to prove just how agile he still was and attempted a few tricks on his skateboard including, reportedly, a hand-stand.\n\nNews of the pratfall leaked. “Fred Astaire, aged 77, has broken his wrist by falling from a skateboard,” announced The Associated Press in a world news bulletin. Three days later a spokesman for Golden Films, Astaire’s company, issued their own update. “It was a clean break but his wrist will be in a cast for six weeks. We wanted to have a picture taken with the cast but he is a little shy about the accident,” a spokesman told California local newspaper The Daily Review.\n\nAlthough he was embarrassed about the accident, Astaire noted drolly that some of his actor friends had cautioned him about the dangers of doing skateboarding tricks at such an advanced age. “Gene Kelly warned me not to be a damned fool, but I'd seen the things those kids got up to on television doing all sorts of tricks,” said Astaire. “What a routine I could have worked up for a film sequence if they had existed a few years ago. Anyway I was practicing in my driveway and fell off.”\n\nYears later, Ava Astaire McKenzie, who had been 34 at the time, said that she recalled her father’s passion for skateboarding. “He was intrigued by it and thought that skateboarding would be a great thing,” she told the BBC. “He was just having to start a film in Ireland, and he had to get over this broken wrist from falling off a skateboard first. If skateboards had turned up earlier, he might have incorporated them into his film routines.”\n\nAstaire’s days of skateboarding were over, though. When he returned to America, Astaire continued his acting career – he appeared in two more films before he died and made a host of television appearances, including in an episode of Battlestar Galactica – and spent his spare time watching horse races, boxing matches and reading true crime stories. He would occasionally remind friends that he was proud to have been awarded a life membership in the National Skateboard Society.\n\nAstaire is not the only celebrity to have got a taste for skateboarding – Farah Fawcett Major and Jodi Foster shared in the mania in the 1970s, and Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Justin Bieber have all been pictured on skateboards in recent years – but Astaire is the only famous septuagenarian skateboarder."
