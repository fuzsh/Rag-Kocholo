The movie marked the first memorable pairing of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly.\n\nOn the Town, which was based on a Broadway play, tells the adventures of three sailors—Gabey (played by Kelly), Chip (Sinatra), and Ozzie (Jules Munshin)—during a hectic 24-hour shore leave in New York City. Over the course of the day, they meet and romance a dancer (Vera-Ellen), a cab driver (Betty Garrett), and an anthropologist (Ann Miller).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
