        "text": "Seattle real estate broker Tyler McKenzie of has lived a life full of dynamic and varied experiences.\n\nFrom his unique and cultured upbringing between Europe and the U.S. to his many diverse career explorations and ties to the Golden Age of Hollywood, his colorful journey has molded McKenzie into the entrepreneur and business leader he is today.\n\nBorn in California, McKenzie spent his early years in the Los Angeles area, where his father Richard McKenzie owned and operated the \"McKenzie Gallery\" in West Hollywood during the 1960s.\n\n\"My dad had a gallery on La Cienega Boulevard called the McKenzie Gallery that ultimately achieved a lot of note as being sort of the gallery to Hollywood. Back in the day, La Cienega was gallery row. It was where all the notable galleries were in the city,\" said McKenzie. \"My dad was known for his reputation as a portrait and landscape artist, and painted portraits of actress Barbara Stanwyck and actor Stan Laurel. He also taught classes and had a lot celebrity openings and whatnot.\"\n\nBefore McKenzie's father branched out on his own, he worked at film star Raymond Burr's art gallery where he met his future wife Ava Astaire, the daughter of Hollywood film and dancing legend Fred Astaire.\n\n\"Raymond Burr had a gallery on La Cienega and dad was one of his gallery artists. In other words, he'd feature artists who hung their work at his gallery regularly. And my mother at some point was working the front desk or as an office administrator and that's how they met,\" said McKenzie.\n\nAva Astaire ultimately raised McKenzie and his brother, as their biological mother had passed away when they were young.\n\nFred Astaire's legacy\n\nWhen speaking of his grandfather Fred Astaire, McKenzie recalls some memorable moments with the film legend while growing up.\n\n\"We had dinner once at a hotel in Dublin when he was making a movie there. It was just the two of us and there was a couple that were being sort of drunk and they were paying too much attention our way, because they wanted to meet him. I just remember that we asked to leave the restaurant through the kitchen so that we didn't have to walk past this couple,\" said McKenzie. \"My grandfather was incredibly gracious and never said no to anybody, but they were so intoxicated and this little balance of waiters surrounded us and we all sidestepped out of the restaurant. It was a really funny moment, it was kind of goofy.\"\n\nWhen speaking of Astaire's films, McKenzie has his favorite.\n\n\"I would actually say my favorite film of his is a movie called 'On the Beach,' with Gregory Peck, which was a post-apocalyptic movie. It's a Stanley Kramer movie, and I think it's a brilliant and fabulous movie, which is not a musical. I actually love all of his musicals and don't necessarily have a favorite one, but there are bits and pieces of different ones that I love,\" he said.\n\nMcKenzie also has fond memories of his time growing up in Europe in places such as the UK and Germany, where he and his family lived for years. He speaks on Astaire's legacy seen through the lens of Europeans.\n\n\"His persona, especially in Europe, I wouldn't say there was a difference in enormity of his celebrity, but because he was of Austrian heritage, and I spent so much time in Germanic countries, there was a level of reverence that was different than the one here, they had a real sort of possessiveness of him,\" he said.\n\nDuring McKenzie's formative years in Europe as an adolescent, he went on to attend the American School in London before moving to Ireland where he spent his final two years of high school in the mid-1970s. He then went on to higher education in Germany where he studied hotel administration.\n\n\"I worked for the Armed Forces Recreation Center in a hotel in Munich for a few years, then came back to the states in the early 80s,\" he said.\n\nMcKenzie's time back in the states were spent working for Dick Clark Productions as a runner and in broadcast journalism.\n\n\"I was in the production world about 4-5 years and worked on a few shows,\" he said. Recalling what Dick Clark was like, McKenzie said, \"My grandfather had made a movie called 'The Man in the Santa Claus Suit,' and Dick Clark was one of the producers on it. As a result of that, he knew my relationship and he was always very kind to me. He was a tough guy and tough on a lot of his other runners, but he always treated me with a bit of difference because of his friendship with my grandfather, and I was grateful for that.\"\n\nThe Seattle Era\n\nEventually moving to Seattle in the mid-90s for work, McKenzie tapped into software production and multimedia and also created projects for Bill Nye The Science Guy. His real estate career started in 2001, where he spent his first 11 years with Windermere Real Estate. This July will make it 22 years since being in the business.\n\nSince 2016, McKenzie has been the owner and designated broker to West Seattle's John L. Scott Real Estate branch off California Avenue before the branch came under new ownership in early 2023.\n\n\"It now belongs to Patti Hill, and we're very proud of what we did and we were happy to have her take over,\" he said.\n\nReflecting on his time of ownership, McKenzie is proud of what he accomplished.\n\n\"We essentially built it from scratch, establishing our own systems, improving those in place from the business we acquired, and learning how to run a 'mom and pop' boutique operation. Working with my wife and partner, Marguerite, has been a wonderful journey. We divided our roles, she oversaw operations while I acted as the designated broker, mentor, trainer and sometimes tough taskmaster for our awesome broker team. Business owners are always on call, and we haven't taken a vacation, just the two of us in a decade. I'd say that's on the horizon with the sale of the business. Even during tough times, such as the pandemic and closing of the West Seattle bridge, I've loved virtually every minute of it, and we managed to thrive regardless of the curve balls thrown,\" he said.\n\nThe office has been known for hosting art and wine walks in the West Seattle community and is reminiscent of McKenzie's father's art gallery.\n\n\"I think it actually creates a nice circle back to my origins as the son of a gallery owner in West Hollywood. The space really captured the look and feel of the business we hoped to build. One of the great things about the space is we had the stairs and chandelier from Frederick & Nelson because the building owner had salvaged them, so it gave it this real old-world elegance and I wanted to create that gallery vibe that I had grown up in. I also wanted our business to be really connected to the community. Because I would really describe West Seattle as being very much like the West Hollywood of my childhood. I love this town, it's a great place to live as well,\" he said.\n\nAdvice to other entrepreneurs out there, McKenzie said, \"It's important to view the world through the lens of entrepreneurship. Only the individual may be responsible for success and failure. As I've often said about our own sales profession, we wake up unemployed every day, but if we put the right systems in place, trust them and continue to do the work, the business and income will come. I think real estate is about as tough a profession as there is.\"\n\nAlthough McKenzie stepped down as owner, he is still actively selling real estate as a broker. His dad, Richard McKenzie, unfortunately passed away in 2015, and Ava Astaire McKenzie is retired and living a quiet life away from the Hollywood spotlight. Tyler visits with his mom often and reflects on their past.\n\n\"I would say that it was a very special time in my life. I got to spend a lot of time with truly intriguing people and met anybody you could have ever expected. I think one of the last times I saw my grandfather we went to the races at Santa Anita and I was sort of his security, because I had taken martial arts for many years,\" he said. \"Betty White had also been one of my dad's best friends, and I got to meet Barbara Stanwyck when I was around 10, went fishing with model Twiggy and her boyfriend, and actor George Maharis is like my second dad. He's my Godfather. I just had a very fortunate exposure to a lot of really interesting people, but we also had pretty modest lives.\"\n\nGoing forward, McKenzie plans to finish writing his novel and enjoy time with family while he stays active as a broker. He reflects on his past with gratitude.\n\n\"From my perspective as a business owner, being able to give back to our local community, it's a simple joy,\" he said. \"It took me the better part of my career to achieve the latter, but getting there and living in that space has been a wonderful journey.\""
