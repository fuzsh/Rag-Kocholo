        "text": "An alleged clause written in Fred Astaire’s will is being shared online after a new film about the actor was announced.\n\nSpider-Man actor Tom Holland confirmed he will play the Hollywood star in a biopic, telling reporters: “The script came in a week ago – I will be playing Fred Astaire.”\n\nThe news has prompted an angry reaction as it’s believed the film goes against Astaire’s own wishes.\n\nSince Astaire’s death in 1987, it has become a Hollywood urban legend that the actor and ballroom dancer was against having his story told on film.\n\nHe is quoted as saying: “However much they offer me – and offers come in all the time – I shall not sell”.\n\nAstaire was allegedly so against granting permission that it’s claimed he included a clause in his will requesting no such film ever take place.\n\n“It is there because I have no particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be,” Astaire is quoted as telling reporters.\n\nWhile inclusion of the clause is unconfirmed, it’s notable that Astaire has never once been depicted on screen by another actor.\n\nHowever, in 1997, digital technology was used to make it look like Astaire was dancing with a vacuum cleaner for a heavily-criticised advert.\n\nHis widow, Robin, granted permission for the rights, with the Hollywood star’s daughter from a previous marriage left “saddened” that his career was “sold to the devil”.\n\nAnother reason why it’s believed Astaire’s will features the clause is that there is yet to be a Ginger Rogers film. Rogers was Astaire’s frequent collaborator and no film of her life could be made without him appearing as a character.\n\nFollowing news of the Astaire biopic, people have been highlighting the alleged clause on social media, with many urging Holland to reconsider the role.\n\nHolland will next be seen reprising the role of Peter Parker in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is released in cinemas on 15 December."
