        "text": "May 10 marks what would have been Fred Astaire’s 113th birthday. For me, he seemed larger than life, yet a brief meeting with him when I was a child a couple of years before his death showed me a very modest, kind human being.\n\nBut then, Fred Astaire, as I learned from family and research, was a study in contrast. Not considered particularly handsome, he was grace and beauty personified when he danced. He wasn’t a great singer, yet he introduced more popular songs than just about anyone else. He was the son of an immigrant and grew up in rough-scuff vaudeville houses, yet he became a man of elegant manners and cultivated sensibilities who was equally at home in a barnyard or a royal mansion.\n\nFred Astaire’s real name was Frederick Austerlitz., named after his father, an Austrian immigrant who had settled in Omaha, Nebr., made his mark as a beer salesman and married a spirited 18-year-old girl named Ann Gelius. The family was musical. Frederick, Sr. played the piano and Adele, Fred’s older sister, flittered like a tiny Titania through her classes at the local dance academy. Fred was unimpressed. “Dancing was merely something little girls did,” he wrote years later. “I let it go at that and the hell with it.” But his parents weren’t about to let it go at that. When Adele was 6 and Fred 4½, their mother carted them both off to New York and enrolled them in the best dance school she could find. “Adele has real talent,” his father said, “and maybe Fred will come around to it someday too.”\n\nAs they got older, the Astaire kids(Ann decided that a family name of her ancestors, Astaire, looked better on a marqee) took a course in advanced hoofing from a showman named Aurelia Coccia and hit the road again. Within a few years they were pulling rave reviews—Adele for her “comic brilliance” and “exquisite floating style,” Fred for his “exciting agility”—that caught the eye of legit producers and led to a firecracker string of super hits (For Goodness Sake, Lady, Be Good!, Funny Face, The Band Wagon) on Broadway and in London. Suddenly the Astaires were the toast of two worlds. At home they mingled with the Morgans and the Whitneys; there they hobnobbed with royalty—the Price of Wales had them to supper and the Duchess of York insisted they come see “the baby,” better known these days as Queen Elizabeth II. Though they loved each other dearly, their personalities were completely different. Adele was known for her sparkling personality. Fred was more withdrawn, preferring to work alone perfecting his dance routines. In 1932 Adele married Lord Charles Cavendish, second son of the Duke of Devonshire, and quit the stage forever. For more on Adele, you might be interested in my article Adele Astaire, Fred’s First Partner\n\nFor Fred, it was decision time - either quit or forge on alone. All through their career, Adele had been the star, him the backup man. What would happen to him without her? As he debated, he fell in love and married New York socialite Phyllis Potter. In addition to Phyllis Potter’s son, Eliphalet IV, known as Peter, the Astaires had two children. Fred, Jr. (born 1936) a charter pilot and rancher, and Ava Astaire McKenzie (born 1942) who remains actively involved in promoting her late father’s heritage. With uncertain expectations, Fred decided to head for Hollywood.\n\nFred had been there before, but failed to make an impression. After inspecting his screen test, a Paramount executive uttered the now famous words “Can’t act. Can’t sing. Balding. Can dance a little.” But this time, Fred had luck on his side. In his second picture, Flying Down to Rio, he was teamed by pure chance with Ginger Rogers, whom he had known in New York. While they weren’t the stars, they performed a dance called the Carioca that stole the picture and captured audiences attention. In this one hot number Fred and Ginger became Hollywood’s most durable and dazzling dance team.\n\nIt was clear from his earliest films that Fred brought something new and unique to the screen. Song-and-dance-style numbers were common in the movies, but Fred was responsible for a new approach to filming dance: he insisted that the entire body be framed in an almost continuous shot. Viewers enjoyed his numbers as if they were watching a live performance. Just as satisfying for Fred Astaire addicts are his footloose soliloquies, those astonishing moments when he dances alone. Imagination running wild, he dances on chairs, on tables, with firecrackers, on walls, on ceilings; in and out of revolving doors, across plazas of thin air; with golf clubs, with hat racks, with noisy squadrons of unpopulated shoes. And all the dances, no matter how fantastic, make a story point, have an emotional meaning.\n\nFred had a passion for perfection, and to achieve it no agony was too great. “The only way I know to get a good show,” he said, “is to practice, sweat, rehearse and worry. Once you set [a dance routine], you must rehearse it and rehearse it until it’s second nature. You must never have to think about what comes next.” The idea was to make everything look effortless, and to reach that point he often rehearsed one dance up to 18 hours a day for six or even nine weeks at a stretch. And his partners rehearsed with him. That was one key to why Ginger stood out. While others were technically superior, she lasted longer because, like him, she truly loved to dance, was eager to learn and considered the end result worth it. Plus, she was wise enough to use her considerable acting skills to bring to each routine.\n\nAfter a temporary retirement in 1946, he starred in several musicals for MGM that became some of his most enduring work. In contrast with his earlier dance sequences, his performances in these films rely more upon spectacle: a slow-motion routine in “Easter Parade” (1948); a dance with an empty pair of shoes in “The Barkleys of Broadway” (1949); in “Royal Wedding” (1951), he solos upon a ceiling. These successes culminated with “The Band Wagon” (1953), which is viewed as one of the greatest film musicals.\n\nIt was during this period that Fred was successful in creating a chain of dancing schools in 1946.\n\nIn 1954, Fred hit a personal low when his wife died from cancer. By the mid-1950s the era of the Hollywood musical was coming to an end, and Fred moved into other fields. On television he produced four award-winning musical specials with Barrie Chase as his partner. He also tried his hand at straight acting roles with considerable success in eight films between 1959 and 1982. Over the years he played a number of characters on television in dramatic specials and series. His Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor in “The Towering Inferno” (1974) was a testament to the scope of his talents and sustained work ethic. In 1981, Fred received a Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. In his acceptance speech, he spoke of Adele, who had died a few months earlier, as well as giving credit to his dance partners.\n\nIn his personal life, Fred married Robyn Smith, a successful jockey in her mid-thirties in 1980. He died of complications due to pnemonia in 1987, buried near his first wife, Adele and parents in Oakland Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, CA. Fittingly, Ginger is also buried there.\n\nWhat is Fred’s legacy? I would first answer that with one question that people, young and old, famous dancers and students anxious to learn all respond to with the same answer: Who would you say was one of, if not the greatest dancer of all time? Their response? Fred Astaire.\n\nBut that begs another question - why? For that answer, you have to consider the man behind the genius. The shy, modest choreographer who possessed a vivid imagination and the heart to share his vision with others. The hardworker who always strove for perfection because he deeply cared about his art. The lighthearted guy next door with a great sense of humor, willing to laugh at himself as well as compliment others. These qualities are, I believe, what kept Fred young at heart in life and what appeals long after his death.\n\nIn Mikhail Baryshnikov’s apt words: “We are, of course, very lucky. His gift, captured in the movies, is one we can all share forever. He was, he is, and he always will be, our never-ending legend.”"
