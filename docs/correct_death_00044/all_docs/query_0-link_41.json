Fred Astaire & Gene Kelly would say hello to you at the post office. You‚Äôd bump into Jack Lemmon at 31 Flavors and Lucy at Hamburger Hamlet. You‚Äôd pass by Edward G Robinson walking his dogs, and Doris Day riding her bike while Freight Trains were plowing down Santa Monica Blvd with the smell of fresh Wonder Bread. \n\nRobinson‚Äôs, Bonwit Teller, The Broadway, Bullock‚Äôs, and The May Co. were the high-end stores of the day. \nWe had local neighborhood joints and restaurants & ice cream parlors such as, Will Wright‚Äôs, the Velvet Turtle, Ah Fong‚Äôs Tony Roma‚Äôs, & R.J‚Äôs. \n\nTV stars and musicians like Alan Hale & Xavier Cugat had their own restaurants on ‚Äúrestaurant row‚Äù. And for the more bohemian types, there was Cafe Figaro, The Melting Pot, The Old World, Alfie‚Äôs and The Source. \n\nTiki-themed restaurants like the Luau, Trader Vic‚Äôs, & The Islander were the current craze, known for their flaming drinks and moats surrounding their properties. Orange Julius and Fotomats seemed to be on every corner. Banks didn‚Äôt have underground parking, and you never needed to get a ticket validated. There was no texting or online shopping or computers. We only had telephone booths and landlines and every was 213 \n\nWe waited in long lines to see summer blockbusters & you had to play video games in the arcade. The only place you could hear the most current songs was on the radio, and we could name every disc jockey who played them. American Graffiti, Dark Side Of the Moon and Kojak had just been released, Columbo & Jim Rockford were our favorite detectives, Johnny Carson ruled late night, and the movie of the week was the big family event. \n\nWe rode amusement park rides and ponies where the Beverly Center is today and roller skated at Fiorucci and Flippers Roller Disco. The Pan Pacific Auditorium was still standing, we shopped for Moccasins at the old Farmers Market, Tower Records was a second home, and our TV sets were controlled by one device called ‚Äúthe clicker‚Äù. \n\nAnd until this day I still refer to Ride Aid ‚ÄúThrifty!‚Äù (More in thread) üëá\".",
