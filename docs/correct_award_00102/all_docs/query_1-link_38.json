        "text": "French writer who won the 1915 Nobel Prize for literature. Two ALSs in French: one is one page, both sides, 5 x 6.5, February 17, 1906. In part (translated): “What a splendid present you’ve just given me!…the characters, the framing, the great compositions, everything is superb and Worthy of the work, in every respect.”; second letter is three sides of two adjoining sheets, 5.25 x 7, October 2, 1919, to an unidentified gentleman. In part (translated): “My letter to you concerning Colas Breugnon. You talk of my Liluli which The Nation is now publishing in English translation…I’d be glad to come to terms with you about publishing the volume in England; but I must tell you that I’ve had an offer for the US. For publication in England and the British Empire. I want 10% per copy, payable at each new printing. I haven’t yet determined the quality of the English translation published in The Nation. I’ve just read the first few pages; overall, the style seemed satisfactory, although some errors will have to be corrected. I’ll have to see the whole translation and have it checked by English author friends of mine. A very important characteristic of Liluli is its poetic rhythm. A faithful poetic copy is almost impossible but at least some English equivalent must be given. Because you are the English publisher of my ‘Above the Battle’…you should be interested in my volume of articles ‘The Precursors’-If you wish to acquire the rights for an English edition…Write to…la Libraire de L’Humanite.” In fine condition, with uniform toning to second letter.
