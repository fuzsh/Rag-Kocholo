        "text": "(1866–1944). French author Romain Rolland was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915 for his series of novels Jean-Christophe (10 volumes, published from 1904 to 1912) and for his pamphlet Above the Battle (1915). The latter pleaded for France and Germany to respect their common humanity in World War I. In these and other writings Rolland expressed opposition to all the forces that divide nations and impede the search for world peace.\n\nRolland was born in Clamecy, France, on January 29, 1866. At 14 he went to Paris, France, to attend school. He remained in the city and received his doctorate in 1895. His first plays were unsuccessful attempts to rekindle a national spirit in France. Rolland collected his plays in two cycles: Les Tragédies de la foi (1913; “The Tragedies of Faith”), which contains Aërt (1898); and Le Théâtre de la révolution (1904; “Theater of Revolution”), which includes a presentation of the Dreyfus case, Les Loups (1898; The Wolves), and Danton (1900). His devotion to the heroic led him to write biographies of Ludwig van Beethoven (1903), Michelangelo (1905), and Leo Tolstoy (1911)."
