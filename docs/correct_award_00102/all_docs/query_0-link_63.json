        "text": "Ivan Bunin became the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. This happened exactly 80 years ago, on December 10, 1933. “Finally, the King of Literature steadily and equally shook a monarch’s hand,” wrote the European press. Only the birthplace of the award winner – Russia-USSR seemed not to notice this historical event.\n\nThis was a tough and hard-won victory – because Ivan Bunin was nominated four times for the Nobel Prize and never gotten the prize itself. The first time this happened was in 1922. The initiator of the Nobel Prize for Bunin was one of the first Nobel Prize winners, the French writer Romain Rolland. He meticulously insisted on the reasonableness of his attempts to award this prize to Bunin also in 1926, 1930 and 1931. However, to win the Nobel Prize, the writer first had to stop believing in this possibility – and only then did the dream come true, in 1933. Ivan Bunin received the award, in the words of the Nobel Committee, for “for the strict artistry with which he has carried on the classical Russian traditions in prose writing.”\n\nOne of the important milestones his continuation of the “classical Russian traditions” is a largely autobiographical novel entitled The Life of Arseniev.\n\nThe novel appeared for the first time in English in London in March 1933, and on November 10 the Swedish Academy decided to award the Nobel Prize to the writer. Everyone understood that the prize was awarded for his literary works created while in exile (Mitya's Love, The Sunstroke, Case Cornet Elagina, and finally The Life of Arseniev). Today, the writer’s books have become not only popular in his home country, but a part of the world literary heritage. A long time ago, Romain Rolland – a Nobel Laureate himself, had been trying for many years to show that Bunin was a unique talent and a “diamond of world literature”.\n\nMostly this happened after his emigration to France in 1920, when his name was mentioned only in whispers in Russia, and only in narrow literary circles by people who were familiar with the prerevolutionary works of the writer. However, even for domestic experts, Bunin remained a white-emigrant. That is, no books were published in his home country, and his name was banned. Nevertheless, those who had emigrated, having recognized in the fate of Arseniev their own lives, applauded him.\n\nOn November 10, 1933, not only did Russian newspapers in Paris come out with headlines saying: “Bunin – Nobel Laureate”, but every emigrant looked at this event as a personal holiday. In pubs and restaurants of Paris that evening all Russians raised toasts to “him that shared their fate.” However, Bunin, on the day and hour, when the Nobel Committee decided to award him the prize, was watching a cheerful nonsensical film called “Baby” at a cinema. Suddenly, the darkness was pierced by a narrow beam from a flashlight – they were looking for Bunin. There was a telephone call from Stockholm. He was invited to a reception being given by the King.\n\nNevertheless, the louder they praised Bunin’s talent, especially when he was supported by the “Friend of the Soviet Union” Romain Rolland, the tougher the reaction of the USSR. In 1930 and 1931, when Rolland asked the Kremlin to support the nomination of Bunin for the Nobel Prize, Moscow, through its Ambassador in Sweden Alexandera Kollontay, started putting out other feelers. Moscow wanted something else – the first Russian to receive this prestigious award should be the proletarian writer Maxim Gorky. After that, Moscow would not object to the emigrant Bunin getting the prize. When this deal fell through, the birth country of the writer reacted very nervously to the awarding of the Prize to Ivan Bunin. The Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta published an article that day entitled “Unfortunately, instead of awarding our great proletarian writer Maxim Gorky, the Nobel Prize went to an inveterate enemy of our revolution”. On the eve of the award ceremony, the writer found out about this. He became very anxious and disappointed, which was especially noticed on December 10, 1933, at a banquet at Stockholm’s Grand Hotel. That evening, Bunin described himself as a “fugitive”. The hall, as the Swedish newspapers wrote that day, was moved by his utterings. After the speech, the writer was handed a folder with the Nobel Diploma, Medal and a check for 715,000 francs. To understand the real purchasing power of such a sum of money in those times, people should read the memoirs of one of Bunin’s friends, the poetess Zinaida Shakhovskaya.\n\nIn her book Reflection, she said: “This amount was enough to live on until the end of their lives, but the Bunins did not buy any apartments or villas ...” Most of the prize money the writer distributed between poor emigrants and elderly people. A special commission was even created and entrusted with the distribution of this money.\n\nLong before the award was given, the writer had received over 2,000 letters asking for help. Initially, the writer allocated 120,000 francs to charity, but the real amount distributed to poor people was much higher than that. The remaining money, Bunin, on the advice of well-wishers, invested into a “really profitable business” – a Russian restaurant, the co-owners of which cheated him, and also into risky securities. As a result, he lived on little money. In 1942, the great, and forgotten by the world, writer wrote in his diary: “Poverty, loneliness, hopelessness, hunger, cold, dirt, are my companions in the last days of my life. And what will come next? How much do I have to suffer?”\n\nHowever, after the World War II, the writer and Nobel Laureate was asked to come home on several occasions. He requested that his books first be published in the USSR. After he realized that his books would never be printed in his native country his will to return waned forever. However, according to the recollections of his family members, he dreamed of visiting St. Petersburg and his native Orel, even if just as a tourist. However, he never returned. Ivan Alexeievich Bunin died in his sleep on the night of November 8, 1953 in Paris. He was buried at the famous Russian cemetery in France – Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois.\n\nThe irony of the writer’s fate is that, almost immediately after his death, in 1956, his literary heritage started being reinstated in the USSR. They published five of Bunin’s works, cautiously selected, heavily censored, but all the same, they were printed...\n\nThe complete collection of his works was published at the end of the 1970s, first in France – in Russian, and then in the USSR, but still with slight censorship and notes. Only in the early 1980s, did the Soviet Union publish the complete collection of Ivan Bunin’s works – this time uncensored.\n\nVladimir Emelyanenko\n\nTweet"
