        "text": "Rolland was born in 1866 in the district of Nièvre, France. He studied literature, music and philosophy, going on to publish two doctoral theses. After some years as a school teacher he went on to teach at the Sorbonne. His interest in music motivated him to publish numerous critical pieces on famous composers as well as artists and writers. As well as being a critic he began to publish his own literature, culminating in the winning of the Nobel Prize in 1915 for his Jean-Christophe . The themes of truth, humanism and altruism are identified most explicitly within his literary work. He died in Vézelay, 1944.\n\nAccess to the items in the collection is unrestricted for the purpose of private study and personal research within the controlled environment and restrictions of the Library's Palaeography Room Uncatalogued material may not be seen.
