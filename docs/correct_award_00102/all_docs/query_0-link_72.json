Taken in 1921, Rolland stands tall and confident against the backdrop of nature. Dressed in a stylish suit with his hands casually tucked into his pockets, he exudes an air of sophistication. Rolland's contribution to literature was recognized when he was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915. His profound understanding of human emotions and deep spiritual insights are reflected in his works that have left an indelible mark on the literary world. In this portrait, we see not only a man deeply connected to his craft but also someone who finds solace amidst nature. The presence of a plant or tree beside him symbolizes growth and vitality - perhaps mirroring Rolland's own creative journey. The monochrome composition adds depth and timelessness to this image from Album de Photographies dans L'Intimite de Personnages Illustres. It allows us to focus solely on Rolland himself - capturing both his intellectual prowess and enigmatic aura. As we gaze at this print by an unknown creator, it serves as a reminder of Romain Rolland's lasting legacy as one of France's most celebrated writers.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
