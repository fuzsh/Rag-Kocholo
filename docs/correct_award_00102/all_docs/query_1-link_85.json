I'm running into a few things I don't know the answer to:\n\n1. In the final few volumes, there are a some illustrations:\n\nThere are two musical scores in Vol. 8 (links to scans: first, second) that should clearly be recreated in MuseScore\n\nThen there is this one, which serves as the header to the prologue of Vol. 10. Also a musical score, but handdrawn and with handwritten lyrics underneath. The handwritten quality seems relevant here, so a case could be made for using a cleaned-up version of the original.\n\nThe same goes (to a lesser extent) for this score in the middle of Vol. 10.\n\nAnd then there is this full page image right before the start of Vol. 9.\n\n2. There are a couple of instances of the below formatting, which trigger lint errors. Should I change this in any way, or rather add these instances to the lint-ignore file?\n\n[...] They were discouraged in advance: they kept on saying:</p>\n\n<p>“There is nothing to be done:”</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>“Let us try not to think of it.”</p>\n\n3. The 6th and 8th volume are both a single, large chapter. Both have an ordinal I for a header in the scans, which could be confusing (there's no chapter II after all). Replacing these with a margin-top: 20vh as described in SEMoS 7.2.10.9 would look better, but is an editorial change. Should I make any changes here, or leave it as is?\n\nThanks!\n\nBob\n\n\n\nAlex Cabal\n\nunread,\n\nto standar...@googlegroups.com\n\nOn 6/10/24 12:57 AM, Bob Reus wrote:\n\n> 1.

Should I make any changes here, or leave it as is?\n\nI think you can leave those chapter numbers there.\n\nNearing the end of this long project! Just a couple of illustrations to fix, a long description to write, and some uncertainties to verify or change:\n\nInline quotations were often italicized in these books. I removed all of them but this one, where I'm not sure how to handle it:\n\n<p>“It is not a matter of fashion,” said Arnaud. “<i>He who does not rejoice to hear a sweet accord of instruments, or the sweetness of the natural voice, and is not moved by it, and does not tremble from head to foot with its sweet ravishment, and is not taken completely out of himself, does thereby show himself to have a twisted, vicious, and depraved soul, and of such an one we should beware as of a man ill-born.⁠ ⁠…</i>”</p>\n\n<p>“I know that,” said Christophe. “It is my friend Shakespeare.”</p>\n\nArnaud is quoting / paraphrasing Shakespeare here, as is shown in Christophe's answer. Removing the italics would make that less clear. Neither emphasis tags nor blockquotes really fit either. Should I ditch the italics or replace them with single quotes?\n\nThen, the divisions. As mentioned before, these books were released as 10 volumes in the original French, and published in 3 volumes (with 4, 3, 3 each) in English. To avoid confusion over this, initially I chose to name and semanticate the divisions as 'books': <section id=\"book-1\" epub:type=\"division\"> for book-1.xhtml, for instance.\n\nBut the longer I work on it, the less certain I am of that choice. I usually refer to each section as a volume, as in \"I'm working on a 10-volume book\", and to further complicate things, the preface refers to 'parts'. Should I change Books to something else?\n\nThere are a few sentences in the book that seem grammatically odd to me:\n\n\"but she still had her ironical manner and her watchful expression, which there was no disarming.\"\n\n\"What man is there can fill the life of a woman and satisfy her immense desire\"\n\n\"what man is there would be worthy to be loved;\"\n\n\"That important personage followed the funeral very correctly, and went immediately it was over\"\n\n\"What was it impelled him to follow them?\"\n\nIs this correct (British) English for the time period?\n\nIn addition to the above, there's this sentence:\n\n\"“So,” he asked, “it was Gottfried [who] taught you?”\"\n\nwhere I have added \"who\" in an editorial commit. If the aforementioned sentences are correct, should I revert this one too?\n\nThere are a couple of full page quotes in the middle of chapters (see chapter 8-1 in the scans here, and chapter 9-2 in the scans here). I tried formatting these similarly to how I did with \"Ite missa est\" in the production of The Book of Jade (see source here and the css here), but my selectors, shown below, don't seem to carry over to the built epub:\n\n#chapter-8-1 blockquote:nth-of-type(13),\n\n#chapter-9-2 blockquote:nth-of-type(2)\n\nAm I overlooking something?\n\nThanks again for your answers\n\n"
