        "text": "New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1915. Hard Cover. Very Good / No Jacket. Item #2344881\n\nInk name on front endpaper, small publisher catalog laid in, 2 inch smudge on rear board.\n\n504 pp. The final three installments in Rolland's classic Nobel Prize winning series. \"Jean-Christophe (1904'1912) is the novel in 10 volumes by Romain Rolland for which he received the Prix Femina in 1905 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915. It was translated into English by Gilbert Cannan. The first four volumes are sometimes grouped as Jean-Christophe, the next three as Jean-Christophe a Paris, and the last three as La fin du voyage (\"Journey's End\"). The English translations appeared between 1911 and 1913.\" \"The central character, Jean-Christophe Krafft, is a German musician of Belgian extraction, a composer of genius whose life is depicted from cradle to grave. He undergoes great hardships and spiritual struggles, balancing his pride in his own talents with the necessity of earning a living and taking care of those around him. Tormented by injustices against his friends, forced to flee on several occasions as a result of his brushes with authority and his own conscience, he finally finds peace in a remote corner of Switzerland before returning in triumph to Paris a decade later.\" \"Romain Rolland was a French dramatist, novelist, essayist, art historian and mystic who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1915 \"as a tribute to the lofty idealism of his literary production and to the sympathy and love of truth with which he has described different types of human beings\".\""
