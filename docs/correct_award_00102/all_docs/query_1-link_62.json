        "text": "February 22, 2017\n\nJean-Christophe (\"JC\") was the last book I read as part of my \"Powys project\": 18 months of great reading, and 100 books. In a way this sprawling monster of a book was an appropriate way to end it, so many of the prior writers were mentioned and many of the earlier themes, so many opportunities were provided to compare JC to the other reading. It was finished in 1911, just five years before Powys put together his list of 100 greatest books, so it captures a lot of the thinking at the time.\n\nJC is the original \"roman-fleuve\" (river novel), a term coined by Rolland, the other great example of which is Proust's \"Remembrance of Things Past.\" It is incredibly long, 1,534 pages, and while not difficult reading from a stylisitic view was extremely dense and required considerable concentration.\n\nApproaching a novel of this length, it's rather difficult to summarize, but I would divide the book into different topics or themes as follows: 1) sections dealing with JC's various love relationships, platonic with both men and women, and not platonic with some of the women, 2) a general narrative of the life of a musician, first in Germany, second in Paris, and at the end in Switzerland, Italy, and then back in Paris, 3) a series of \"portraits\" of various people in European society, describing their lives in a page or a few pages, 4) occasional sequences of dialogue which seemed to come straight out of a play (and Rolland was a playwright as well), 5) a book of artistic theory through the lens of music, and 6) a book of social discourse on the various events and thoughts occurring in Germany and France at the time of the Third Republic and the rise of Bismark, and also dealing with events such as the rise of socialism and the Dreyfus Affair.\n\nRolland is most successful in the book when he describes the non-platonic relationships of JC with women, particularly Ada and Anna. The book at these times seems very realistic, and the book is quite powerful. Until the Ada chapter, the first 300 pages of the book were sort of like \"Goethe light\", and almost unbearable. These relationships had by far the greatest impact on me as the reader.\n\nRolland has JC fall in love with two men, first Otto, his first love, and then later his great love/friendship with Olivier. Rolland's description of these relationships is very frank. Less successfully done are his numerous platonic relationships with women, of which are there almost too many to list. These seems a little unrealistic and even disappointing, particularly towards the end.\n\nOutside of JC's various \"loves\" are the friends he has that he does not love, the most successful portrayal of this is his relationship with his elderly admirer \"Stolz\", in fact this particular episode to me was the most successful in the book.\n\nNext, Rolland describes the history of JC as an artist and a musician, as JC moves from being a very hot tempered creator to being more subdued in later life. The description of the creative process is described in rather elevated terms. I found this to be fairly successful, although - jokingly - I kind of wanted to hear the music.\n\nRolland's portraits, most famously done in the \"House\" chapter (which describes, floor by floor, the inhabitants of Rolland's lodging in Paris) are incredibly interesting, but truly falls in the realm of the \"tell, not show\" way of writing, which gives it to me more sociological than literary interest. There are so many of these - hundreds? - the book is endless - and yet they are never boring.\n\nRolland does not use dialogue often, but when he does, it is usually in a set scene that runs on for a few pages. These scenes are very well done and are a welcome relief from the rest of the book, as you are finally being shown how the characters are rather than being told. Rolland has a nice taste for the dramatic.\n\nThe general artistic theory passages, which are extensive, are largely incomprehensible, as Rolland can't seem to articulate anything concrete. This can be incredibly frustrating at times, in particular, the critics are constantly being complained about without any meaningful sense of \"why\". Rolland seems wrapped up on vagaries.\n\nFinally, where Rolland is at his weakest and most painfully naïve (in light of future events) is the sociological criticism, whether discussing the differences between the French and the Germans, his thoughts about French society, and his discussion of Jews (while Rolland is not anti-Semetic per se, some of his comments are disturbing). It is all very \"race-conscious\", and while incredibly interesting as a reflection of what society at the time was thinking about itself (as opposed to later historians), it is almost sad to read.\n\nThat being said, one of the most interesting things about the book is how society back then reflected society today. There is a long discussion about feminism and working women which could have been written yesterday. The discussion of the Dreyfus Affair and the way it divided families and the French nation seems similar to recent discussions of Donald Trump. One very interesting thing is how prevalent atheism or \"free thinking\" was - religion was in decline even before the World Wars accelerated the process. So the book has to me incredible value to someone studying the history of that period and looking for what people were thinking at the time. It also shows how utterly distant from the mind of today people were back then.\n\nAll of the foregoing being said (I apologize for the length of this review, but this book is so incredibly long, I left the need to approach it in this fashion), the question remains of the book as a whole. In that regard I have to start by saying that although there are certain similarities to the coming of age novels of many of the writers in the Powys list, Rolland's book was a unique experience, in that I really felt I was \"living the life\" of JC, and rather than \"observing\" his life, I was brought in so deeply into his thoughts and experiences, reading the book was a much more meaningful experience than the Maugham book or the Meredith book. That being said, JC was not a particularly admirable person - he was deeply flawed throughout, and often behaved abominably. On the other hand, he wasn't an anti-hero, he was meant to be sympathetic, particularly in his artistic endeavors, and sometimes he showed heroic qualities. Nonetheless, at all times he seemed very real to me, and on a personal level his experiences had meaning, I felt like I was living an alternative version of my own life, rather than reading about someone else's life. I don't know if this is because of a personal artistic temperament of mine, but there was a different kind of realism to this book which I can only describe as emotional.\n\nPowys' description of the book makes sense - it would be a good book to use to create your own artistic philosophy of life, but as noted, I did find that to be one of the weaker parts of the book, and I'm not sure if the comment would be applicable today.\n\nFinally - who would I recommend this to? Well, if you want to experience the \"roman-fleuve\", a different reading experience than what you may have previously had, this is a good example. If you are interested in literary and sociological thinking at the time of the Third Republic (1890 to 1910), or if you love music (particularly Beethoven) and want to revel in the story of a musician, this novel would be worth exploring. Rolland was famous in his day - he won the Nobel Prize in 1914, he was with Joyce in Zurich in 1917 (and was one of the signatories asking for the complete Ulysses to be published), he was an ardent pacifist, he carried on a long correspondence and was a major influence on Freud, and Jean-Christophe was read by pretty much all of his literary contemporaries until it largely disappeared after WWII, and was largely ignored by the modernist movement. While I don't view it as a masterpiece or even a work of particular genius, it is an incredible achievement. It is the furthest thing from a quick and easy beach read that you could possibly imagine. So there - I recommend it as an \"extreme reading experience\" - there should be a special club for those who have made it through the whole thing (and by the way, don't give up! - it's always getting better). Let me know when you finish, I'm happy to take you out to dinner, we could talk all night about it.\n\nDecember 27, 2014\n\nRomain Rolland received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1915 with Jean-Christophe being one of his most exemplary works. A friend recommended the author and book and, and although it had been quite a slog to get through the first 200 pages I am indebted, and if only for having read the section on Antoinette.\n\nIn a general sense Jean Christophe is unquestionably a powerful book, just in terms of its scope, describing the nature of Jean-Christophe himself who in spite of the lofty ideals and an exuberance and love for life has to overcome a ceaseless stream of obstacles – most of which occur due to his own vision of himself and his intransigence. It reminded me of John Galt in Atlas Shrugged. Like Ayn Rand’s epic, this story is also told from the perspective of a lost generation, but with a freshness and with less stridency, less orthodoxy. It is as if Romain Rolland had a greater sense of our humanity, and if he railed, then railed like a good coach: we can do better! In Jean-Christophe we are introduced to a range of characters - from all walks of life, the bourgeois, the politician, the artist, the impoverished, the broken – and each is described in excruciating and fascinating detail, all extraordinarily human: We are sinners all (even Jean-Christophe) and yet Rolland invokes the greatness in us – in his world we’ll never be replaced by machines, democracy, ideas and ideals are important, people have value.\n\nOne of the most fascinating parts of the book was The House, in which Romain Rolland enacts, describing in great detail and passionately, the friendship that develops almost instantaneously between Jean-Christophe and Olivier Jeannin, which begins with the first ten pages a most beautiful ode to friendship: ‘a kindred soul to which I cling in the midst of torment, a tender and sure refuge in which to breathe again, no longer to be alone, no longer never to unarm, no longer to stay on guard with straining burning eyes until from sheer fatigue he should fall into the hands of his enemies’. After so many pages of struggle, it comes across as elegantly beautiful, sublime, and it resonated, especially in these modern times, where deep friendship is such a need, and one that is as spontaneous, luminous, inclusive and a source of joy. It seemed extraordinary that Romain Rolland had such insight into a fundamental human need, and midway through The House he quotes ‘the poisoned tree of the world puts forth two fruits sweeter than the waters of the fountain of life: one is poetry, the other, friendship’.\n\nFor me, Jean-Christophe in Paris stopped being a struggle when I met Antoinette. This girl is not pivotal to the story, so (I don’t think it requires a spoiler alert) to say that she dies. Her life is unquestionably tragic. Yet it is so lived in love that the story transcends .. well, even before Antoinette, Romain Rolland introduces us to Sidonie, another saint, ‘of a stock that has few considered reasons for living yet a tremendous vitality, a tenacious hold on life’ subjected to ‘the drab unhealthy, unnatural existence – the ordinary existence imposed on servants by the middleclass … their indifference … a cramped airless life with no prospect, no ray of hope’, and interestingly it is poor Sidonie who chastises Jean-Christophe: ‘You have only seen rich people. The rich are the same everywhere. You’ve seen nothing at all.’ There is a fleeting flashback to the 15th century where Jean d ’Arc’s love for France – ‘her tenderness of heart, gentle in the most bitter fight, good even among the most evil, peaceful in war, to which, war the Triumph of Satan she brought the spirit of God – compared to Charles VII who debauched and prostituted the nation. In this sense Jean-Christophe in Paris is a very contemporary novel. Antoinette was a bitter-sweet but brilliant interlude: the section preceding Antoinette (The Marketplace) ends with Jean-Christophe saying to himself repeatedly ‘I have a friend’ and the section, a 100 pages later, following Antoinette begins, again , with Jean-Christophe uttering ‘I have a friend’, amid the delight of it all. Unknown to Jean-Christophe Antoinette, whom he met just once, with whom (and maybe unknown to him) he shared an unspoken romance, has died young, and yet according to the Breton superstition her spirit, her love and her modesty remained, living out her life in her brother Olivier. When he and Jean-Christophe met, it was her eyes that he saw in Olivier’s.\n\nI really enjoyed Romain Rolland’s work. The novel had both a universality and timeliness, filled with brilliant observations, some unkind, some outright caustic and angry, some other quite anti-semitic, and white British folk didn’t come across too lightly either. It made for an interesting and entertaining read. I personally enjoyed the journey, and realize that as I approached the end that this is a book I could dip into again and again.\n\nEdwin\n\nNote that Jean-Christophe in Paris actually comprises three volumes in the Jean-Christophe series: The Marketplace, Antoinette and The House. There are four volumes that precede it: Dawn, Morning, Youth and Revolt. The events in the Marketplace occur with Jean-Christophe flight from Germany in Revolt."
