Being on stage was the dream that lead me to Carnegie-Mellon University where I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre.

While working at professional theatre jobs in the San Francisco Bay area, I taught theatre courses at Mills College as well as San Francisco State University where I had previously completed my Master of Arts in Theatre. Eventually I earned a Doctor of Philosophy in Theatre degree from Stanford University.\n\nContinue to my About Me page."
