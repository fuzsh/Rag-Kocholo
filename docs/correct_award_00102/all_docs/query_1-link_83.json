        "text": "Romain Rolland (January 29, 1866 - December 30, 1944) was a French writer. His first book was published in 1902, when he was already 36 years old. Thirteen years later, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature 1915 for his most important work, Jean-Christophe.\n\nHis mind sculpted by a passion for music and hero-worship, he sought a means of communion among men for his entire life. Because of his insistence upon justice and his humanist ideal, he looked for peace during and after the First World War in the works of the philosophers of India (\"Conversations with Rabindranath Tagore\", and Mohandas Gandhi), then in the new world that the Soviet Union initially wanted to achieve. But he would not find peace except in writing his works.\n\nLife\n\nRolland was born in Clamecy, Ni�vre to a family of notaries; he had both peasants and wealthy townspeople in his lineage. Writing introspectively in his Voyage int�rieur (1942), he sees himself as a representative of an \"antique species\". He will cast these ancestors in a truculent bawdy tale Colas Breugnon (1919).\n\nAccepted to the �cole normale sup�rieure in 1886, he first studied philosophy, but his independence of spirit led him to abandon that so as not to submit to the dominant ideology. He received his degree in history in 1889 and spent two years in Rome, where his encounter with Malwida von Meysenburg -- who had been the friend of Nietzsche and of Wagner -- and his discovery of Italian masterpieces were decisive for the development of his thought. When he returned to France in 1895, he received his doctoral degree with his thesis The origins of modern lyric theatre and his doctoral dissertation, A History of Opera in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti.\n\nA teacher, a pacifist, and a loner\n\nHe became a history teacher at Lyc�e Henri IV, then at the Lyc�e Louis le Grand, and the �cole fran�aise de Rome, then a professor of the History of Music at the Sorbonne, and History Professor at the �cole Normale Sup�rieure.\n\nA demanding, yet timid, young man, he did not like teaching. Not that he was indifferent to the youth: Jean-Christophe, Olivier and their friends -- the heroes of his novels -- are young people. But with living youths, like adults, Rolland only maintained distant relationships. He was above all a writer. Assured that literature would provide him with a modest income, he resigned from the university in 1912.\n\nRomain Rolland was a lifelong pacifist. In 1924, his book on Gandhi contributed to the latter's reputation, and the two men met in 1931.\n\nHe moved to the shores of Lac L�man (Lake Geneva) to devote himself to writing. His life was interrupted by health problems, and by travels to art exhibitions. His voyage to Moscow (1935), on the invitation of Maxim Gorky, was an opportunity to meet Stalin, and he served unofficially as ambassador of the French artists to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1937, he came back to live in V�zelay, which, in 1940, was occupied by the Germans. During the occupation, he isolated himself in complete solitude.\n\nNever stopping his work, in 1940, he finished his memoirs. He also placed the finishing touches on his musical research on the life of Ludwig van Beethoven. Shortly before his death, he wrote P�guy (1944), in which he examines religion and socialism through the context of his memories. He died December 30, 1944 in V�zelay.\n\nBibliography\n\nRomain Rolland Bibliography\n\nYear Work\n\n1888 Amour d'enfants\n\n1891 Les Baglioni Unpublished during his lifetime.\n\n1891 Emp�docle\n\n(Empedocles) Unpublished during his lifetime.\n\n1891 Orsino Unpublished during his lifetime.\n\n1892 Le Dernier Proc�s de Louis Berquin\n\n(The Last Trial of Louis Berquin)\n\n1895 Les Origines du th��tre lyrique moderne\n\n(The origins of modern lyric theatre) Academic treatise, which won a prize from the Acad�mie Fran�aise\n\n1895 Histoire de l'op�ra avant Lully et Scarlatti\n\n(A History of Opera in Europe before Lully and Scarlatti) Dissertation for his doctorate in Letters\n\n1895 Cur ars picturae apud Italos XVI saeculi deciderit Latin-language thesis on the decline in Italian oil painting in the course of the sixteenth century\n\n1897 Saint-Louis\n\n1897 A�rt Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1898 Les Loups\n\n(The Wolves) Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1899 Le Triomphe de la raison\n\n(The Triumph of Reason) Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1899 Danton Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1900 Le Poison id�aliste\n\n1901 Les F�tes de Beethoven � Mayence\n\n1902 Le Quatorze Juillet\n\n(July 14 -- Bastille Day) Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1902 Fran�ois-Millet\n\n1903 Vie de Beethoven\n\n(Life of Beethoven) Biography\n\n1903 Le temps viendra\n\n1903 Le Th��tre du peuple\n\n(People's Theater)\n\n1904 La Montespan Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1904 - 1912 Jean-Christophe Cycle of ten volumes divided into three series -- Jean-Christophe, Jean-Christophe � Paris, and la Fin du voyage, published by Cahiers de la Quinzaine\n\n1904 L'Aube First volume of the series Jean-Christophe\n\n1904 Le Matin\n\n(Morning) Second volume of the series Jean-Christophe\n\n1904 L'Adolescent\n\n(The Adolescent) Third volume of the series Jean-Christophe\n\n1905 La R�volte\n\n(The Revolt) Fourth volume of the series Jean-Christophe\n\n1907 Vie de Michel-Ange\n\n(Life of Michelangelo) Biography\n\n1908 Musiciens d'aujourd'hui\n\n(Contemporary Musicians) Collection of articles and essays about music\n\n1908 Musiciens d'autrefois\n\n(Musicians of the Past) Collection of articles and essays about music\n\n1908 La Foire sur la place First volume of the series Jean-Christophe � Paris\n\n1908 Antoinette Second volume of the series Jean-Christophe � Paris\n\n1908 Dans la maison\n\n(At Home) Third volume of the series Jean-Christophe � Paris\n\n1910 Haendel\n\n1910 Les Amies\n\n(Friends) First volume of the series la Fin du voyage\n\n1911 La Vie de Tolsto�\n\n(Life of Tolstoy) Biography\n\n1911 Le Buisson ardent Second volume of the series la Fin du voyage\n\n1912 La Nouvelle Journ�e Third volume of the series la Fin du voyage\n\n1912 L'Humble Vie h�ro�que\n\n(The Humble Life of the Hero)\n\n1915 Au-dessus de la m�l�e Pacifist manifesto\n\n1915 Received the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n1917 Salut � la r�volution russe\n\n(Salute to the Russian Revolution)\n\n1918 Pour l'internationale de l'Esprit\n\n(For the International of the Spirit)\n\n1918 L'�ge de la haine\n\n(The Age of Hatred)\n\n1919 Colas Breugnon Burgundian story\n\n1919 Les Pr�curseurs\n\n(The Precursors)\n\n1920 Founded the review Europe\n\n1920 Cl�rambault\n\n1920 Pierre et Luce\n\n1921 Pages choisies\n\n(Selected Pages)\n\n1921 La R�volte des machines\n\n(The Revolt of the Machines)\n\n1922-1933 L'�me enchant�e\n\n(The Enchanted Soul) Seven volumes\n\n1922 Annette et Sylvie First volume of l'�me enchant�e\n\n1922 Les Vaincus\n\n1924 L'�t�\n\n(Summer) Second volume of l'�me enchant�e\n\n1924 Mahatma Gandhi\n\n1925 Le Jeu de l'amour et de la mort\n\n(The Game of Love and Death)\n\n1926 P�ques fleuries\n\n1927 M�re et fils\n\n(Mother and Child) Third volume of l'�me enchant�e\n\n1928 L�onides\n\n1928 De l'H�ro�que � l'Appassionata\n\n(From the Heroic to the Passionate)\n\n1929 Essai sur la mystique de l'action\n\n(A study of the Mystique of Action)\n\n1929 L'Inde vivante\n\n(Living India) Essays\n\n1929 Vie de Ramakrishna\n\n(Life of Ramakrishna) Essays\n\n1930 Vie de Vivekananda\n\n(Life of Vivekananda) Essays\n\n1930 L'�vangile universel Essays\n\n1930 Goethe et Beethoven Essay\n\n1933 L'Annonciatrice\n\n1935 Quinze Ans de combat\n\n1936 Compagnons de route\n\n1937 Le Chant de la R�surrection\n\n(Song of the Resurrection)\n\n1938 Les Pages immortelles de Rousseau\n\n(The Immortal Pages of Rousseau)\n\n1939 Robespierre Historical/philosophical drama\n\n1942 Le Voyage int�rieur\n\n(The Interior Voyage)\n\n1943 La Cath�drale interrompue\n\n(The Interrupted Cathedral) Volumes I and II\n\n1945 P�guy Posthumous publication\n\n1945 La Cath�drale interrompue"
