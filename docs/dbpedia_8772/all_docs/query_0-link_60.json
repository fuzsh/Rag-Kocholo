        "text": "Dashboard Confessional frontman Chris Carrabba on Friday revealed that he sustained \"severe but not life threatening\" injuries after figuring in a motorcycle accident June 6th.\n\nIn a message posted on the band's social media pages, Carrabba expressed his \"endless gratitude\" to the doctors, nurses, and medical team treating him. He also assured fans that although he has surgeries and months of rehab ahead of him, he is \"determined to make a full recovery.\"\n\n\"I have not lost sight of the social issues at hand, and even in the condition I'm in I find it important to state that I stand with Black Lives Matter. In the near future it is likely I will not be able to follow the news as much as I normally would. If you don't hear from me on critical social issues I trust you will know where I stand,\" he added.\n\nCarrabba thanked Bell Helmets, Biltwell, Rev'it, Alpine Star, and Wolverine Boots \"for making the safety gear that protected my body in the crash\" as well as his family and friends for coming together to support him in this time of need.\n\n\"To all reading this I would like to say thank you for standing by me through my recovery. This will be difficult physically, emotionally and financially, and I'm grateful to have your support as I go through it.\"\n\nToday, Carrabba gave an update on his health status with a photo of him giving a peace sign from his hospital bed. \"Second surgery successful. Long road ahead. Thank you for your kindness. I don't know how I'd get through this without all of you,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Dashboard singer has yet to shed light on what really happened and how, although it is apparent in his latest photo that it was indeed terrible. Prior to the crash, Carrabba was actively going live on his social accounts to play songs for fans while in quarantine."
