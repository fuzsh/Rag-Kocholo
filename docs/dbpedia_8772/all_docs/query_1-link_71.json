        "text": "Dashboard Confessional, the acoustic, indie-rock band headed by Christopher Carrabba, will perform in concert at SUNY Fredonia on Sunday, Nov. 6, at 7 p.m. in the Steele Hall Field House. The show will be open to the public, ages 16 and older, as well as SUNY Fredonia students. General admission tickets are $15. Students may purchase up to two tickets with valid college I.D. at $8 each.\n\nThe opening act for Dashboard will be singer/songwriter John Ralston, whose latest acoustic rock CD is \"Needle Bed.\"\n\nWinning a 2002 MTV Music Video Award for their song, \"Screaming Infidelities,\" Dashboard Confessional has sold out its past 300 shows. The group has released many popular full-length CDs, including “Places You Have Come to Fear the Most,” “Swiss Army Romance,” and “A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar.”\n\nDashboard Confessional is an American acoustic/electric guitar-driven emo rock band led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Chris Carrabba from Boca Raton, Florida. The current lineup includes Carrabba (guitar, vocals), Scott Shoenbeck (bass guitar), John Lefler (guitar), and Mike Marsh (drums). Formed in 2001, Dashboard Confessional became more popular by appearing on soundtracks such as Shrek 2 and Spiderman 2.\n\nEmo is a term that has come to define post-hardcore music scene that developed from punk rockers. At a Dashboard show, for example, all the masochistic rituals that characterise punk rock evaporate. Emo music generally implies personal, meaningful lyrics, usually of an introspective nature, and a deep connection with a band's audience.\n\nThis show is sponsored by Spectrum Entertainment and is in part paid for by the students of SUNY Fredonia’s Student Activity Fee. To purchase tickets for the show please visit the\n\nSUNY Fredonia Ticket Office located in the Williams Center or call 716-673–3501.\n\nSpectrum Entertainment is a unique source of entertainment on the SUNY Fredonia campus. The organization is run entirely by students and provides the campus community with various forms of entertainment including lectures, comedians, musical acts, Hanging of the Greens, Fred Fest, and much more."
