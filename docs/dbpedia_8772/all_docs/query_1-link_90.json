        "text": "The bands on the “Rockstar Energy Drink Taste of Chaos Tour” know what’s helped fuel their success: Friends and fans.\n\n“We all started together, all of us booking tours in the same network, all of us crossing paths back and forth, all of us playing shows together, tours together, with our side projects together,” Dashboard Confessional vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chris Carrabba said. “We all rooted for each other, worked really, really hard together. It didn’t matter who got bigger, it didn’t matter who got big faster, all of it was pure fighting against the grain. If somebody got up the next rung, they were reaching back to pull you up and still doing so.”\n\nTour headliners Dashboard Confessional will be joined by Taking Back Sunday, Saosin with Anthony Green, The Early November, Saves the Day, Quicksand, The Get Up Kids, Senses Fail and more for “Taste of Chaos” at San Manuel Amphitheater in San Bernardino July 16.\n\n“It’s going to be good to be back in the company of so many bands we are both friends with and fans of,” Taking Back Sunday lead vocalist Adam Lazzara said.\n\n“It’s an honor to be able to know that we not only share a stage with these people, but we share friendships and we all collectively, I can say this for all these bands, have a very unique to us I think — probably not exclusive to our scene, but unique to our scene — special relationship with our audience and it’s really great to be out with bands like that instead of getting the hairy eyeball from another band,” Carrabba said.\n\nCarrabba grew up with music\n\nCarrabba was surrounded by music growing up. His mother would always have cassettes playing on the boombox, while he and his brothers shared their different tastes, spinning albums on their record player.\n\n“I remember that the tenant below us was a drummer, so he was practicing drums while we were listening to records. So there was this cacophonous mayhem,” Carrabba said.\n\nAt 15 he began dabbling in guitar, writing songs during downtimes from his first passion, skateboarding.\n\n“My life revolved around skateboarding and then we moved to Florida from the Northeast so you could skateboard all year, except when it rained, and that’s when I started to really write music. We started a band just for when it was torrential outside,” Carrabba said.\n\nDashboard working on new album\n\nDashboard Confessional’s lineup is rounded out by lead guitarist John Leflet, bassist Scott Schoenbeck and drummer Mike Marsh. “Alter the Ending” (Interscope Records), released in 2009, is the band’s most current effort, although Carrabba said that he is busy writing and recording songs for another album soon.\n\nFans key to success\n\nCarrabba notes that Dashboard Confessional has had a few moments in the spotlight, such as with the single, “Vindicated,” featured on the soundtrack of “Spider-Man 2,” and an appearance on “MTV Unplugged,” but he credits the band’s success to its fans.\n\n“I do think about the fanbase and my goal is to connect with the fanbase because — who knows why we’re so lucky — they decided that they were going to give us a career,” Carrabba said. “There was a time where people would come to my show and they would buy a CD, but they’d buy two because they wanted to give it to a friend that hadn’t heard it yet. It was spread by the deep sense of importance that they placed on making sure everybody heard us. I don’t know why we got so lucky, but I’m so glad we did.”"
