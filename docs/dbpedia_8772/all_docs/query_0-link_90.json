        "text": "Dashboard Confessional: 5:30 p.m. Saturday; Jannus Live, 200 1st Ave. N., St. Petersburg; $28.50; jannuslive.com\n\nOne of Florida’s biggest musical successes has returned with its first album in nearly a decade, and soon it’ll make his way back to the state where it all started.\n\nEmo group Dashboard Confessional, led by singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba, will play St. Petersburg’s Jannus Live on Saturday on a tour supporting this year’s new record “Crooked Shadows.”\n\nCarrabba started Dashboard Confessional around 2000 in Boca Raton as a solo side project from his group Further Seems Forever. But he quickly found success with his new act, reaching No. 2 on Billboard with his 2003 record “A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar.”\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Carrabba discussed making “Crooked Shadows,” growing up in Florida and playing an upcoming Parkland school shooting benefit with longtime friends from the band New Found Glory. Here are excerpts.\n\nHow did you approach making “Crooked Shadows,” your first album as Dashboard Confessional in almost a decade?\n\nI think that I wanted to make a record that came from the same place as a writer that my early records did, but had the sense of scope and production and instrumentation that I’ve learned over the years. See if I could find, as if this is my first record I had ever made but I knew what I know now, see what kind of record that would sound like. That was the approach, anyway.\n\nThe album includes guests like electronic group Cash Cash and violinist Lindsey Stirling, who aren’t exactly who you might imagine based on your sound.\n\nRight. Well, we could do that, which is just give people what they expect, I suppose. Though I always like working with my friends from my scene, it’s exciting to work with new people that bring something out of you that you wouldn’t otherwise find, because you have to be knocked out of your comfort zone from time to time in order to grow.\n\nHow was it working with each of them?\n\nI met Cash Cash quite a long time ago, I want to say 15 years ago. So we’d been waiting and looking for the right thing to do together and we found it in the song “Belong.” I found that I was writing a song with almost half an eye towards, “Wow, I feel like I’m writing something like a Cash Cash song or my version of a Cash Cash song.” So I thought I’d reach out and they were excited to collaborate.\n\nWith Lindsey, it was a funny confluence of she came up in conversation between a couple of different friends of mine, independent conversations of each other. So on a lark, I reached out to her. I know that she was a fan of our scene, so I thought I could go out on a limb and see if she would give one of our songs a listen. And she was really excited, to my I guess surprise. You never get over the jitters, it’s almost like asking someone to the dance or something like that. (Laughs)\n\nYou’re playing on this tour with Beach Slang and Kississippi, two acts from a newer generation. Who are some of your favorite new artists, emo or just in general?\n\nWell, I think those two are great examples. I’m a massive fan of Phoebe Bridgers — and by the way, I like the way you asked that because I don’t know how they classify themselves, so I don’t want to box them in. I would consider them part of our scene, but I also consider our scene a bit more vast than other people might. But Phoebe is one of my favorite lyricists and singers and songwriters that I’ve heard in my life, to be quite honest. Diet Cig is another band that I love quite a lot. There’s a band called PUP from way up in Canada someplace. Culture Abuse I think is writing some of the strongest mid-tempo rock songs that I’ve heard in a long time, just a really incredible band.\n\nWhat was the Florida music scene like when you started out?\n\nThere was a really inclusive scene, so there weren’t such strong borders between styles of music. So I could be playing with myself and my guitar with New Found Glory and Shai Hulud and Morning Again and maybe even The Jive Step Bunch, which was this massively successful ska band from down south. And then also, as you know, Florida is this big place but somehow it’s removed from the rest of the country, it’s like we have our own ecosystem there. So you had all the Gainesville bands that would come down and we almost thought of Hot Water Music as our national act.\n\nAlso, it was pretty socially progressive and it was also a place where a lot of folks, and I’m one of these folks, that either were predisposed or made to feel unwelcome or an outcast or an outlier, never quite fit in right until I was found by that music scene. It was a place where they fostered individuality and differences, but also where they encouraged you to be accepting of other people’s ideas. It was progressive, in the very traditional definition of the term.\n\nBetween the Pitchfork article and the sexual misconduct allegations against Brand New’s Jesse Lacey, there’s been some recent discussion about misogyny in the emo scene. Did you feel that was true?\n\nWell, I can say the music scene I came up in, not just as a band but as a member of the musical community, was a safe place. Some people have damaged that, and I think we have to take it back. But I didn’t feel that females were underrepresented in the way that maybe it looked once the bands started getting successful. When the scene itself was homespun, it was very even along the gender lines. The movers and shakers within the scene, especially ours, were very smart, frankly, girls. Amy Fleisher, who owned Fiddler Records, was putting out records for New Found Glory and Dashboard and other bands that would go on to be successful at 15 years old.\n\nYou’ll be performing at a benefit concert for Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors. I know New Found Glory members went to school there and you lived nearby.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t my first experience with survivors of school shootings. It’s a very sobering and awful thing, and it does hit close to home quite literally because the high school I went to was not far, only miles away. My girlfriend went to school at Douglas. I have friends that are teachers there right now, I have friends who lost children on that day. It’s a horrifying thing and if we can in any small measure do something to help, we will."
