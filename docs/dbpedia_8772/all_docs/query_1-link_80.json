        "text": "[ad_1]\n\n[Photo by: Dave Bean]\n\nDashboard Confessional frontman Chris Carrabba was involved in a motorcycle crash on Saturday, June 6.\n\nThe frontman took to social media to announce that he has sustained severe, but non-life-threatening injuries and is currently recovering in the hospital.\n\nRead more: Asking Alexandria’s James Cassells and wife are expecting their first child\n\nOn June 11, Carrabba shared a photo of him recovering in the hospital. Although his injuries are not life-threatening, he does have future surgeries and months of rehab ahead of him. Carrabba did not detail the extensiveness of his injuries sustained in the accident.\n\n“Hi friends,” he says. “On June 6th I was in a motorcycle accident. My injuries were severe but not life-threatening. I owe the amazing doctors, nurses, and medical team treating me my endless gratitude. I am determined to make a full recovery, but I have surgeries and months of rehab to come.”\n\nCarrabba then shifted the conversation to the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests that are happening worldwide.\n\n“I have not lost sight of the social issues at hand,” he writes. “And even in the condition I’m in, I find it important to state that I stand with black lives matter. In the near future, it is likely I will no be able to follow the news as much as I normally would. If you don’t hear from me on the critical social issues, I trust that you will know where I stand.”\n\nCarrabba also shared a statement thanking the safety gear that helped protect him in the crash. He also thanks his friends and family for coming together during this time of recovery.\n\nRead more: Hear a Paramore fan give “Hard Times” a cathartic reimagining\n\n“I’d like thank: Bell Helmets, Biltwell, Rev’it, Alpine Stars and Wolverine Boots for making the safety gear that protected my body in the crash,” he says. “I would also like to thank my family and friends for coming together to support me in this time of need. To all reading this, I would like to say thank you for standing by me through recovery. This will be difficult physically, emotionally and financially and I’m grateful to have your support as I go through it.”\n\nFollowing the announcement, a number of artists have shown their support for Carrabba while he recovers in the hospital.\n\n“Sending you love and a swift recovery,” Mayday Parade tweets.\n\n“So glad you’re okay,” Rise Records‘ band Social Animals tweets.\n\n“Get well soon Chris,” The Early November and Hellogoodbye alum Joseph Marro tweets.\n\nOthers including Circa Survive‘s Anthony Green and Lights shared their support and warm wishes to Carrabba on Dashboard Confessional’s Instagram post.\n\nSee more: 10 surprising artists you won’t believe appeared on AP’s cover\n\nOutKast, Issue #153, April 2001"
