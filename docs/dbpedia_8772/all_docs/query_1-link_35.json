        "text": "Vocalist and guitarist Chris Carrabba of emo rock band Dashboard Confessional has taken on a new groove. Flanked by mandolinist Suzie Zeldin (The Narrative), bassist Jonathan Clark and drummer Ben Homola (Bad Books), he has forged Twin Forks, a folk band, tempered with bluegrass, Americana and rock. The outfit is getting rave reviews from critics who say the songs are delightfully unpolished with plenty of catchy hooks.\n\nThe group is touring in support of its self-titled EP, released on Dine Alone Records in September, and is scheduled for the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Monday.\n\n“I was looking for something that was going to help me with a little writer’s block, so I started writing in a different fashion,” Carrabba said. “The first thing I started doing was a very traditional singer/songwriter approach, a lot of fingerpicking and a lot of storytelling, and I was really happy with it. During the course of that, I was recording covers and I had one or two that had the feel of what would become a Twin Forks song.”\n\nCarrabba, with the help of future Twin Forks band mates, took his new music on stage during the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco in October 2012 and everything clicked.\n\n“When we did that festival we said: ‘We’re not going to be a band, we’re not going to be a band.’ And then we walked off stage and looked at each other and said, ‘Well, we’re a band,’” said Carrabba, laughing.\n\nBased in Florida, Carrabba makes time every day to work on his music. Playing either guitar or piano, he believes going through the motions creates a “muscle memory of writing a song” so it will flow easily when inspiration comes.\n\nOver the past few years there has been a resurgence of acoustic and folk music and a re-emergence of it from underground to mainstream, Carrabba said. He notes that this movement may lead to better songwriting, as the stripped-down equipment makes it harder to disguise poor musicianship and lacking lyrics.\n\nGrowing up in Connecticut, Carrabba was first a fan of folk and then later punk. He said the two genres are surprisingly similar, beginning with their links to counter-culture. But as he became a musician, Carrabba grappled with trying to separate himself from his folk past before finally accepting it.\n\n“I tried very hard not to sound (folky), and tried to be more rocking and percussive with my guitar playing. But as I grew more and more comfortable with the acceptance that your influences absolutely make you who you are as a player and there’s something to be proud of with working within the parameters of your influences and trying to excel within that framework without retreading,” Carrabba said.\n\nTwin Forks will finish the year by continuing its tour of the United States, Canada and Australia. Early next year, the band plans to begin work on a full-length album, culling the material from its current EP and adding to it.\n\nIn the meantime, Twin Forks will be posting new songs on its website for fans to download for free.\n\n“We like to share our music with you, and if you like it we ask you to share it with somebody,” Carrabba said. “I think if people think (the music is) great it’s because you can hear the excitement on the record, the excitement of being in this band. We’re just thrilled, we feel so lucky. We’ve all been in bands before so we know the difference between liking something and loving something.”"
