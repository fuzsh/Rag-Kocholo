        "text": "This summer, Dashboard Confessional has one eye on the past and one eye on the future.\n\nUnder the leadership of Chris Carrabba, the reunited emo icons are hitting the road this summer as part of the Rockstar Energy Drink Taste of Chaos Festival, hitting the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel tonight.\n\nAlong with Carrabba and company, this year’s Taste of Chaos Festival features a number of acts that won the hearts and minds of young rock listeners in the early ’00s, including Taking Back Sunday, Saosin, The Early November and Saves the Day.\n\n“I plan to try to do this a few summers in a row, or at least as many times as I can,” Carrabba told the Asbury Park Press’ “Fan Theory” podcast. “Touring with your friends makes you so much better, because … there’s a sense of adventure that is infused into the moment. You’re really all in it together, like you always were.”\n\nBut, as he’s touring the country with plenty of his longtime emo-rock peers, Carrabba — who’s also released material with Further Seems Forever and Twin Forks over the years — said he’s hard at work on the first Dashboard Confessional album since 2009’s “After the Ending.”\n\nCarrabba calculatingly recaptured the classic acoustic Dashboard Confessional sound on the band’s new single, “May,” released last month. He told “Fan Theory” that the new songs are being created in an independent, old school fashion.\n\n“When I started Dashboard, no one was paying attention. … There was no one looking over your shoulder. There were no notes from a record label. There were no pressures to get out on your next tour and be finished in time,” Carrabba said. “And that’s where I am again now again, strangely.\n\n“If I look at my body of work, I think those have been the songs that have lasted the longest, the ones that happened in a vacuum. I’ve probably written better quality songs when I got notes or when I had pressure. Pressure can be great.\n\n\"When I had expectations placed on me that can be great, and that can be effective. But there is a unique longevity to the ones that I wrote when no one was looking, and I think I’m going to get that again. These songs feel dense and full and heartfelt and exciting, and it’s not a put-on. It’s just happening.”\n\nROCKSTAR ENERGY DRINK PRESENTS TASTE OF CHAOS\n\nWITH: Dashboard Confessional, Taking Back Sunday, Saosin, The Early November and Saves the Day\n\nWHEN: 5:30 p.m. today\n\nWHERE: PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 on the Garden State Parkway, Holmdel\n\nTICKETS: $30.95 to $60.95\n\nINFO: www.tasteofchaos.com"
