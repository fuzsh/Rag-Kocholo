        "text": "We sure as hell didn’t want last night to end, as Moneen was joined by Dashboard Confessional’s Chris Carrabba on stage in Toronto, ON, Canada!\n\nWelcoming Carrabba to the stage with a hug during the band’s encore, Moneen’s Kenny Bridges joked, “If you got great pals around, you gotta play music with them. I kind of don’t want this night to end, ever. So, Chris, we’re gonna do the 20 minute version of this song.”\n\nAs the opening chords of Dashboard Confessional‘s “Hands Down” filled the air, the crowd burst into a cacophony of cheers and applause. Carrabba led the way into the first verse, the audience joining in unison, creating an electrifying harmony that blended seamlessly with Bridges as they united for the track’s infectious chorus. The two vocalists fed off of one another’s energy, smiling between the lines and creating an unforgettable moment for Toronto fans.
