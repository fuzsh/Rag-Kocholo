        "text": "Since the early 2000s, both Dashboard Confessional and the All-American Rejects have kept the torch burning for emo music — and this summer, they’ve teamed up for a tour that will stop at Tag’s Summer Stage in Big Flats on Saturday night.\n\nDashboard Confessional has been on the radar since 2001’s “The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most” included the trademark single “Screaming Infidelities” and yielded the band’s first platinum-certified album, peaking at No. 5 on Billboard’s Top 200. After that, the band racked up a second platinum album (the live “MTV Unplugged 2.0”), two gold-selling albums and songs features in TV shows like “Cougar Town,” “One Tree Hill” and “Scrubs” as well as films such as “Shrek 2” and “Spider-Man 2.”\n\nAfter their sixth studio album, 2009’s “Alter the Ending,” the band took a break from the studio as lead singer and songwriter Chris Carrabba explored solo touring, a reunion with his former group Further Seems Forever, and the folk band Twin Forks. A new, as-yet-untitled new album has been completed, however, and should be released later this year or early in 2018.\n\nThe All-American Rejects likewise formed in 2000, when vocalist/bassist Tyson Ritter and guitarist Nick Wheeler were still in high school. Both 2002’s self-titled debut and 2005’s “Move Along” went platinum, and \"Gives You Hell” — a track from 2008’s “When the World Comes Down” — proved to be the band’s most successful, hitting No. 1 in the U.S. pop chart.\n\nEarlier this month, the Rejects released a two-song EP with the tracks \"Sweat\" and \"Close Your Eyes,” the group’s first studio recordings since the 2012 album “Kids in the Street.” A full album is expected later in 2017.\n\nOpening the show will be The Social Animals, whose debut EP “Formative Years” was released last summer, with a full album expected before year’s end.\n\nEarlier this month, before hitting the road, Carrabba discussed touring with friends, writing the latest album and why fans shouldn’t expect to hear many of the new Dashboard tunes just yet.\n\nQ: How did you get paired up with the All-American Rejects for the summer tour?\n\nCARRABBA: We did it to ourselves — the best way! [laughs]\n\nThere are four bands that are on my list where every year I hope we’re free at the same time. We’ve tried for several years trying to time it right with the Rejects. They’re either in the studio while we’re on tour or vice versa, but this time I think they’re record’s in the can or they’re in pre-production.\n\nI always give them a little text and I expect a “brother, man, I can’t” — this, that and the other — and I’m like, “No problem, next year!” When I saw that “yes,” I literally did a fist-bump.\n\nQ: Do you feel like who you tour with affects your own performance? Is there a different chemistry?\n\nCARRABBA: 100 percent. Everything affects how you perform, but if you’re out with bands that you love — if you love their music — and then those bands can pull it off live plus add that extra thing that you can’t explain live, then I’m psyched watching the shows or I’m out with the audience. If you see a guy out in the audience who looks just like me, it’s me!\n\nThere’s no competition, though — it’s not like watching tapes of your opponent’s game before you go on. It’s this overall, genuine love and admiration of what someone’s doing.\n\nThen there’s the other factor. That’s an hour or so, but you spend the rest of the day with these guys too. They make you laugh, or maybe they’re creative and you’re writing songs together or listening to each other’s songs. Maybe you’re all getting on your bikes and riding over to a local brew — just doing stuff that friends do on their days off, but we’re lucky enough to do those things on days when we get paid. [laughs]\n\nYou take all these factors and they boil over onstage, but I couldn’t tell you how. They’re no predicting how it will turn out each night, what will inspire you or in which way it will be shown through the performance. I’d like to think the other bands are inspired by what we do, too, because you want to give them as much as they’ve given you. That’s maybe in the very back of your mind: I hope they’re listening, and it’s a bit of a “thank you.” It’s like getting a nice boost as you climb up a wall — you hope that they know you’re reaching a hand back and saying, “Come up here, too.”\n\nQ: Earlier this year, you said you’d written something like 40 songs for the new album, and you were still writing them. What do you think inspired that burst of creativity?\n\nCARRABBA: I don’t know. Sixty-seven is the count right now. Full disclosure: I’m including every rotten one that comes out. I’d like to say that’s less than 50 percent.\n\nWhen I get in a writing phase, I really try to lock it in, I really try to stay in that place, I really try to make it a dogmatic piece of my daily routine. The reason there’s so many is that I learned a long time ago to finish a song, no matter how bad it is. Possibly one of the hardest parts of any kind of writing is finishing it, knowing when it’s done and where to put the last piece down.\n\nI try to stay well practiced in the ability to finish a song, so that when it’s really good, I’m less likely to become hung up on how to finish it. I’ve had good songs that have gotten away from me.\n\nQ: The album is pretty much done. Is there a title or a release date yet?\n\nCARRABBA: Nope! I will sit for hours and write songs, but that bit right there just reeks of effort. [laughs]\n\nQ: Was it hard to winnow down the 67 songs to figure out which ones made the album?\n\nCARRABBA: I found it relatively easy to get it to 25, and then between my bandmates and some trusted outsiders who might as well be in the band, they were able to help me get it down to 17, and then I guess we’ll mix those 17 and put it in a proper album length. As for the rest, they could be pieces for the next record, they could be an EP — you know, the world needs B-sides, too. I think there’s a place for a lot of these songs.\n\nI’m not worried that I’m not using something that should be used for this record, because we spent a lot of time not making records and we’re back in the record-making period of our band. These [remaining] songs, if they have legs, will still rise to the occasion in the next round. If they don’t have legs — well, good thing, we shouldn’t have put them on this record either.\n\nQ: Are you going to share any of those new songs on tour this summer, or are you saving them for when the album comes out?\n\nCARRABBA: Don’t come see us, because we’re only playing the whole record that isn’t done yet and we don’t know any of the words or the parts. That’s it — we’re out there just to learn in front of you.\n\nNo, no, no — is there possibly anything more than the disappointment when a band plays too many songs that they’re going to put out one day? I have a hard-and-fast rule that one is phenomenal, two is pretty cool, three is a great time to go get a beer. I guess I’ll play three if the audience is thirsty, but otherwise I’m pretty sure it’ll be two, max.\n\nWe began playing a song called “We Fight” on our club tour in January, and I expect because it’s timely in a political sense and timely in an emotional sense and timely in a sonic sense that that would be the one we could choose, but there are two more that I think we could rotate in and out.\n\nWe’re there to play every song you really hope to hear, but we also would like to give you an invitation to listen to our new record one day.\n\nFollow Chris Kocher on Twitter: @RealChrisKocher\n\nIf you go\n\n•What: Dashboard Confessional and The All-American Rejects with opening act The Social Animals\n\n•When: 8 p.m. Saturday (gates open at 6:30)\n\n•Where: Tag’s Summer Stage, 3037 State Route 352, Big Flats\n\n•Tickets: $25 for general admission, $49.50 for reserved seating, $75 for gold circle; call 800-650-TAGS or go online to www.tagstickets.com"
