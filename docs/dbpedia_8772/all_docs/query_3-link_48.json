He also writes lyrics.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nWell As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs\n\nAnd sit alone and wonder\n\nHow you're making out\n\nBut as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone\n\nMaking out.\n\nScreaming Infidelities\n\nAnd the plaster dented from your fist\n\nin the hall where you had your first kiss\n\nreminds you that the memories will fade.\n\nThe Brilliant Dance\n\nPlease tell me you're just feeling tired\n\ncause if it's more than that I feel that I might break\n\nAgain I Go Unnoticed\n\nI'll be true, I'll be useful...\n\nI'll be cavalier...I'll be yours my dear.\n\nand I'll belong to you...\n\nif you'll just let me through.\n\nthis is easy as lovers go,\n\nso don't complicate it by hesitating.\n\nand this is wonderful as loving goes,\n\nthis is tailor-made, whats the sense in waiting?\n\nAs Lovers Go\n\nDo you, do you like dreaming of things\n\nso impossible or only the practical\n\nor ever the wild or waiting through all your bad bad days\n\njust to end them with\n\nsomeone you care about\n\nand do you like making out\n\nand long drives and brown eyes\n\nand guys that just\n\ndon't quite fit in\n\nSo Impossible\n\nAnd breath, deeply from this envelope, it smells like you, and I, cant be, without that scent, its filling me, with all you mean to me\n\nLiving in Your Letter\n\nCause now that I can see you,\n\nI don't think you're worth a second glance.\n\nSo much for all the promises you made, they served you well\n\nand now you're gone and they're wasted on me.\n\nSo much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well\n\nand now it's gone and you're wasted on me.\n\nRapid Hope Loss\n\nHow the girls could turn to ghosts before your eyes\n\nAnd the very dreams that led to them are keeping them from dying\n\nAnd how the grace with which she walked into your life\n\nWill stay with you in your steps,\n\nAnd pace with you a while\n\nSo long, so long.\n\nSo Long, So Long\n\nWalking away, it's not the same as running, is it to you now, that you've run this in the ground?\n\nYou say take this, this medicine is just what you deserve. Swallow, choke, and die.\n\nThis Bitter Pill\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nLyrics"
