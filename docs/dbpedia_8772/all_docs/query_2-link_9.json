He is also the lead singer of the band Further Seems Forever and the folk band Twin Forks.\n\nAs a teenager, Carrabba was passionate about skateboarding and took only a mild interest in his musical talent. Having received his first guitar from his uncle Angelo, he taught himself to play at the age of 15 and recorded his first solo album, The Swiss Army Romance. He attended Florida Atlantic University, where he studied education. For a few years after college, Chris taught special education at an elementary school in South Florida and played with the group Further Seems Forever."
