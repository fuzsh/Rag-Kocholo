        "text": "An interview with singer/songwriter Chris Carrabba | Written by Jameson Ketchum\n\nIt’s quite the phenomenon to have a lifetime career in music. Even more incredibly unlikely is to have two widely successful and revered projects that connect so deeply with their listeners. It’s all the more fascinating to achieve these feats by being a genuinely down to earth and gracious dude. Somehow Chris Carrabba has accomplished all of these goals in his 39 years and seems to be rapidly locking in his third act (though we’re sure not yet a finale) with folk band Twin Forks. Never one to rest on his laurels, you only need to spend a few minutes with Carrabba to realize why he’s on that stage; he needs to be.\n\nYou’ve stated before that Twin Forks is the type of music you always wanted to play. With the success of Dashboard and Further Seems Forever over the years, did you begin to think that you were never going to get this chance?\n\nI didn’t know that I was ever going to be able to play this type of music. Generally, in the kind of folk or traditional singer/songwriter or bluegrass music that I like, the guitar playing is deceptively hard. Then there was a period where I thought that I didn’t have anything to add to this. This all pre-dates the radio stuff. When we were making the early Twin Forks stuff, those bands were just starting to be on the radio. You couldn’t have predicted that though. I would have laughed you out of the room.\n\nWhen you did start to see that movement start to emerge, did it increase your worry that maybe you don’t have anything to add?\n\nIt’s obvious those are hit songs. I thought they were opening a door for those of us who don’t aim at radio. I realized that people were opening the door a little wider for the kind of instrumentation that we use. I was really happy when that started happening. Mumford and Sons for example, they could have sounded like The Killers and still be the biggest band because they write these massive tremendous songs.\n\nWhat was your headspace when you did start writing these Twin Forks songs? Before it blew up on the radio, were you pretty fearless about it?\n\nYeah, I didn’t care. Its’ very similar to making the first record you ever made, no one is paying attention.\n\nI think a lot of musicians would be afraid of that, considering the career you’ve already built.\n\nI figured this was niche, I couldn’t find a deeper niche to dig myself into. The other thing is that I feel like I’ve earned a little bit of the right to be fearless. I can say that, right? I’ve worked really hard to build this thing and I’ve been true to it, same with Dashboard and Further, I’ve been true to it. It’s given me license to do what I love. I think there is some crossover too. Maybe I could have melded what I do now into Dashboard but I wanted it to be separate players and life experience. I didn’t want to be like “Hey, this is another kind of music I like so I’m going to ram it down my fans’ throats and make them have to decide”. Instead we put it on a parallel road and let people discover it.\n\nIn a recent interview, you talked about the early days of performing and how if the crowd wasn’t into an act they might do something like throw quarters at the band. Today I feel like you just see faces buried in phones.\n\nI haven’t encountered that phenomenon personally. It’s a head up culture at our shows. So maybe that’s the difference, I’ve always accepted that the audience is just as important, if not more important than anything we can do on stage. So we not only embraced it but fostered it right from the get-go, maybe that’s why I don’t notice it, they’re too busy helping us be a band.\n\nYou’ve always been the artists to go talk to kids in line, work your own merch and really work to keep that face to face interaction with fans. I don’t feel like you see that as much these days.\n\nI still think they’re almost befuddled to see you in person. We interact online but you miss so much, the feed just keeps getting pushed down so you miss some things. Maybe you Tweet but we’re at sound check but if you come up to the merch table I’m going to have a conversation with you. I guess it’s still personally rewarding when someone looks me in the eye and says thanks.\n\nI think some bands still want to have some mystique.\n\nI never felt the mystique thing. Maybe it’s because of the music scene I’m from.\n\nDo you feel fearless still?\n\nYes, more than ever before. It doesn’t mean I demand that anyone listens to it or likes it but I can do it.\n\nWhat are some missteps or mistakes you’ve felt you’ve made throughout your career?\n\nI think I’ve trusted some people I shouldn’t have trusted along the way, I’m sure that’s a common tale. I think I’ve made some missteps with this song or that song but you’re only in the moment you’re in. I don’t know anybody who doesn’t wish they could change the bridge to that one song etc. I kind of regret stopping Dashboard for as long as we have stopped it. It kind of feels hard to start again.\n\nAre you trying to start again?\n\nI’ve never closed the door. It’s just that I love doing this other thing so much. One thing I guess I would cite as a mistake is, and this is a strange one, but I’ve liked to see the world a little more. We’ve seen the inside of every bar, club, amphitheater and arena in every country, but seen very little of the country.\n\n(At the time of this publication, Dashboard Confessional has released news of a tour with Third Eye Blind this summer as well as a new song that can be heard at DashboardConfessional.com)\n\nWhat do you still want to accomplish with Twin Forks? Do you compare this to your other projects saying “Well I took Dashboard this far so I’d like to take Twin Forks this far”?\n\nI’d like it to be a career for everybody. I don’t know that it has to match the success, but we just want to do the best work that is possible for us to do. That’s all I’ve ever wanted for Dashboard too. I’ve never set these incredible goals that were unobtainable or too bold. Where we’ve reached is beyond the goals we had set, but every time you reach a goal you set the bar a little further along and higher. That’s how I feel with Twin Forks. I think I’ve been fortunate to have a career doing music so I’d like to see my band mates have that with this band. And it’s happening. I’ve had three bands that have been important to people in some fashion. That’s pretty lucky."
