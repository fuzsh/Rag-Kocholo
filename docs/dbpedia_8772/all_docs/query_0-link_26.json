        "meta_description": "<strong>Dashboard Confessional</strong>, one of the most iconic emo bands since early 2000s, is set to play in Singapore for the first time on\n<strong> 9 September, Saturday</strong>. Propelled by \n<strong>Chris Carrabba</strong>’s intimate and emotionally raw lyrics, sweeping acoustics and his charismatic presence, Dashboard Confessional stands as one of the biggest alternative bands of the 2000s. Some of their most iconic songs include “\n<em>Hands Down</em>“, “\n<em>Vindicated</em>” and “\n<em>Stolen</em>“.  The four-piece band hailing from Florida in the United States has introduced their own brand of alternative rock over the past couple of decades, which has swept through a generation of ’90s kids who embraced their albums and sold out arenas. In light of their upcoming concert next Saturday at \n<strong>D’Marquee @ Downtown East</strong>, we speak with lead singer Chris Carrabba in an email interview dated today about recent events as well as what we can expect in Dashboard’s debut Singapore show.  Dashboard Confessional’s Chris Carrabba. Photo: Noisey  \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: What has Chris Carrabba been up to this week?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “I have spent the last week or so learning some of the songs we don’t always play live in case someone requests one of them.” \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: We’re so glad that you guys decided to have a Southeast Asia tour this year. Is there any reason in particular why you and your band chose to make this return to our side of the world?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “We are so happy to be invited to play in Southeast Asia. We never expected to have the fan base we have there. We were all just blown away by the passion of the audiences there on our first tour in Southeast Asia and we are excited to be coming back.” \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: Some artists have mixed feelings about their breakthrough song. Is that the case with Dashboard Confessionals and “Stolen”?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “Not for me. I love the song. I am happy other people love it too!”  \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: If you could choose one problem to solve in the pop punk scene today, what would it be? How would you go about solving it?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “I would remove all the trolling and snark from the scene. Music is meant to unite not decide. There is no place for elitism, in my opinion, in music.” \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: Taylor Swift previously invited you over as a special guest to her best friend’s party. What was the story behind that invitation?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “Taylor is my friend and I don’t think of her as ‘Taylor Swift super star’. I admire her and her graciousness.”  \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: What can we expect from your Singapore show next month?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “Lots of fun and passion!” \n<strong>POPSPOKEN: Lastly, beyond being recognised as one of the most iconic bands of our time, how would you like Dashboard Confessional to be remembered?</strong> \n<em>Chris Carrabba:</em> “I would love to be remembered as a band that loved what they did and never took that for granted.”  Dashboard Confessional’s current lineup includes Chris Carrabba on vocals, Scott Schoenbeck on bass, Arnon Jay on guitar and Ben Homola on drums & percussion.  \n<em>DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL · LIVE IN SINGAPORE 2017</em> \n<em>Saturday, 9 Sep, 2017</em> \n<em>8:00 pm</em> \n<em>D’Marquee @ Downtown East</em> \n<em>1 Pasir Ris Close, Downtown East, Singapore 519599</em> \n<em>General Admission Standing – S$118 or $88*</em> \n<em>*Excluding SISTIC Booking Fee</em> \n<em>Get your tickets at the SISTIC Website.</em> \n<em>== Keep culture journalism alive, at just the price of a kopi.
