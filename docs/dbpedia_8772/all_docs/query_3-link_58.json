        "text": "MOUNT POCONO — Chris Carrabba and the tour life have history. Dashboard Confessional has taken him across the world to venues in South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. This summer he’ll be on the road again, and keeping company with tour mates Taking Back Sunday, Saosin and The Early November is one way he’s keeping his 16th year of touring with Dashboard Confessional fresh.\n\n“We all get along so well, we have a long history of working together, touring together … for most of us, our conversation is shorthand,” Carrabba said. “It must be said too that I’m a massive fan of all these bands. When it works really well I get a tour like this where I know I’ll be out there in the audience watching every band until it’s my turn to play.”\n\nOn June 9, the four bands play Pocono Mountain Carnival Grounds during the 2016 Taste of Chaos tour. Started in 2005 by Warped Tour Founder, Kevin Lyman, and Mayhem Festival Co-founder, John Reese, Taste of Chaos went dormant after its 2010 international run, but was brought back in 2015 with a one-off date in San Bernardino, California, that included Dashboard Confessional. When Lyman and Reese decided to bring the tour back for another round, they chose to partner with Carrabba’s band.\n\n“We were kind of putting this tour together when Taste of Chaos came to us,” Carrabba said. “The thing was, the festival was such a spirit of camaraderie. That show was basically incredible and it just seemed like a really fun thing to do to take that across the country.”\n\nTaking Back Sunday didn’t play the 2015 date; their first Taste of Chaos experience came years earlier during in 2006. Before joining this year’s tour, the band wrapped up its seventh album, which marks the first time Taking Back Sunday has recorded three albums in a row with the same lineup.\n\nAccording to vocalist Adam Lazzara, the consistency has a lot to do with having like-minded band mates.\n\n“We’re all at a place where we understand how lucky we are to be able to do what we do,” Lazzara said. “With that comes the understanding that the only thing you can do is your best. Everybody’s bringing that to the table, which just makes for a real exciting time. Going straight from this studio process into the Taste of Chaos tour, that’s going to make for some real fun shows.”\n\nWhereas Taking Back Sunday is made up of a reunited original lineup, Dashboard Confessional features two newcomers along with Carrabba and longtime bassist Scott Schoenbeck. Drummer Ben Homola joined the band from the folksy Twin Forks (also fronted by Carrabba), while guitarist Armon Jay came up through the same scene that lifted Dashboard Confessional into the public spotlight more than a decade ago. Carrabba didn’t mince words when asked what to expect when the four take the stage together June 9.\n\n“This new blood is deeply connected to the songs, so I think what you’ll get from us is the best version of us you’ve ever seen,” Carrabba said. “That’s awfully cocky to say, but I mean it.”"
