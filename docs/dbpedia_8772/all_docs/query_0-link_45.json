        "text": "Canvino now arouses your ears as well as your mouth. Introducing the perfect soundtrack to cracking a can or 4. Dashboard Confessional lead singer Chris Carrabba.\n\nIn 2019, Chris came on board as an investor, partner and ambassador.\n\n\"I love the aesthetic. I love that it's sustainably made. I love that it empowers female winemakers. I love the convenience of the can. As importantly as all of that, I love how the wine tastes.\"\n\nWe can't wait to fill all five of your senses with the artistry of Dashboard Confessional, and Canvino.\n\nSusy’s youth in the countryside of Bolivia sparked her love of agriculture and led her to Universidad Mayor de San Simon to receive her BS in agriculture. Susy came to the United States on an internship at California Polytechnic State University in organic crops, and then as a liaison between the winemakers and vineyards for Gallo. When she discovered her passion for winemaking, she sought and achieved her Winemaker Certificate form U.C. Davis and spent ten years developing impressive wines at Gallo and Constellation.\n\nShe has won multiple gold medals and platinum “Best of Lodi” award for her whites, reds and rosés. She brings all of this knowledge and skill to every drop in every can of Canvino.\n\n“Brightly shining star winemaker” – Lodi Wine Comission"
