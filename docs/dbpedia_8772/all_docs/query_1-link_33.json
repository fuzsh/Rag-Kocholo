        "text": "Monica Molinaro and I are scheduled to meet Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba backstage at Taste Of Chaos in San Bernardino at around 3 p.m. when we run into the tour manager, who tells us the night before Carrabba got hit in the face with a swinging bass on stage and his mouth has just started bleeding again. Apologetically he says we will have to postpone while he goes to get medical attention again.\n\nSo when Monica and I do meet up with him two hours later, his tongue no longer bleeding, the conversation naturally starts with tales of stage injuries. But as we talk with Carrabba, who is excitedly preparing his first new album since 2009 after a string of six Dashboard albums in nine years, including three gold records, the conversation winds many, many places, from songwriting to the current tumultuous world climate.\n\nSteve Baltin: The stage accidents at least make for entertaining stories though.\n\nChris Carrabba: Yeah, they do. And honestly I do this thing where I visualize the whole show before I go out there. It makes me feel like it’s already a good show happening before I even get there. So when that happened it wasn’t part of my visualization. But I diverted from the actual impact and I just continued on with it, get back into the show. Nobody cares that I’m bleeding, they care about the song.\n\nBaltin: What was the moment then you rediscovered that you wanted to continue as Dashboard because obviously you had to want to do this?\n\nCarrabba: I counted this up the other day, between 2000 and 2009 we came to the fact that I had 19 releases and toured 300 days, probably doing 285 shows a year for the majority of those years, from 2000 to 2009. So 2009 rolls around, I do a headlining tour, then we do a tour with Bon Jovi and then we did one more headlining tour. When we finished I kind of turned to the guys and said, “I’m tired.” They’re like, “Thank god.” We were totally prepared to come back, play tiny little clubs, do the whole thing. We took this time off, and it was years, from 2009 to last summer, and we did that co-headlining tour with Third Eye Blind. What brought us back was we did Riot Fest the previous year, 2014, and it was unreal. Everything was there for us and the audience came all to our stage. So it was beyond evident to us that they cared. It was a really special moment.\n\nWhen we walked offstage I asked the same question that I asked probably on a monthly basis, “Are we ready?” And they said, “Yeah, let’s go.” So then we did that Third Eye Blind tour, the co-headlining tour was an interesting way to do it because we actually reached out to a whole new audience and had our audience. We were not thinking about a new record. But all that fight and that excitement when we got home, we started writing and we just were really diligent, do not say a word. We didn’t want a prying eye.\n\nMonica Molinaro: When we spoke with Thrice, Dustin [Kensrue] said there’s a different intensity going back into it once you took a break and you have this overview of what you’re doing and what you want to do.\n\nCarrabba: Yeah, and a lot of that for us comes down to how we want to behave and who we want to be out here. What we want more than anything is to celebrate and appreciate every little moment of every day. Things happened fast and we were younger, so you don’t think to do that. And you walk away and you come back and you say, with the perspective of being a real adult now, “This is a special thing, so everyday let’s just take a minute to do something together.” I started playing when I was 15, my mom had to sign a temporary conservatorship over to the oldest guy in the band so I could cross state lines. So this is a lifelong passion, dream, the only thing I ever wanted to do and I’m allowed to. That’s why I say how we carry ourselves on and off the stage is as important to us as any song we’ll ever write or anything. A lot of young bands, the pressure is so great that they get a temper. And I can only imagine that I did. It’s an odd thing to be saddled with, “Well, you’re 20, but now you run a business.” I’m not an entrepreneur. But I became one quick and in doing so the pressures of turning that focus, marrying art and commerce, it’s so complicated.\n\nMolinaro: It’s really touching to hear that because as fans of all of you guys it’s really beautiful to grow into your own families and these relationships where you can appreciate that and they do call you out before positive. It’s something that is very visible to your fans.\n\nCarrabba: I hope so.\n\nMolinaro: I think it is and we always talk about being genuine. Though, you don’t focus on that because if you do you’re probably not that genuine.\n\nCarrabba: (Laughs) Well said. When Dan [Bonebrake] left the band, the original bass player, he’s my best friend, it was tough. And we got Scott [Schoenbeck] to play. I loved the Promise Ring so much, one of his many bands. And he came in so serious because he’d been in this band that had been professional for so long. But over the years he’s gone from dark and serious to bright and like a beacon of positivity. Inside our own band I can pinpoint it. It’s that one guy, the guy that looks like Izzy Stradlin, the guy who’s not supposed…you think that guy’s got a cold black heart, no way.\n\nMolinaro: Is it a practice of yours to be actively mindful, and to be aware of these things?\n\nCarrabba: At one point, I was a really scattered guy. For years now, I will just stop and say, probably because I got it off a great album title, but just \"be here, now.\" That's it. Be here, now. You know what? There's lots of stuff to fix, always, and I can't fix it during this interview, you know? So, I'm so much happier having discovered that. It was sort of a long-fought journey to find out how to be that way. But it feels great. It really feels great to just be here, now.\n\nMolinaro: It seems like something that the entire world needs to focus on right now.\n\nCarrabba: Yeah, it's a mess of a place. Getting onstage, right as we walk back on for our encore, it seems so silly to have to say it, but black lives matter, and brown lives matter, and white lives matter, every color matters, every gender, and every sexual identity, and every sexual designation/preference, religion... this is so simple. Yeah, of course it matters, it matters a lot. Because if it matters to you, it simply matters. This is the most hippie thing I'll ever say, but it's the human race, man. We have to be in this together.\n\nBaltin: What can you tell us about the new Dashboard album?\n\nCarrabba: I'm really excited to have a new Dashboard record. I'm really excited. I'm gonna say something I probably shouldn't say--I love my later era records. But I do like the old stuff better, and I've come to that realization recently. They were written in anonymity, and there weren't any prying eyes or fingers in the pie or anything like that. I guess we went to the right a little bit for the next few, and I've always wondered, what if we kept going straight or to the left? It feels like we went back to the split-point. I don't know if anybody else will hear that, but that's where I'm writing from, and I feel really lucky about that, because I'm not crafty enough to do it by design, it's just that I have to be a slave to the moment. And I'm really grateful to be back in that place. That's what I would add, thank you.\n\nBaltin: If you look back on those early records, is there one song in particular that you get excited to play on a nightly basis?"
