Chris has a show later today along with the Get Up Kids and in a sense feels back to normal for a day. Learn more about these livestreams at their respective sites and social media. Snag a ticket and support. If you’re in the future, my guess is these will be available streaming or in this episode’s case, you’ll have a nice track by track of some of songs Chris picked to chat about with me.\n\nWhat makes this day so interesting is that on March 11th 2020, I saw Dashboard Confessional and The Get Up Kids at Webster Hall in New York City. It was the last show I saw and my last night in New York City after living there for 16 years.\n\nI haven’t seen a show since. It’s now coming up on a year of that and many things have happened to me personally and professionally that reset my life and the world around me. Chris had the same story but more severe. He was in an accident and had to relearn many things we take for granted and even this performance took a lot out of him. It’s a testament of love that he was shown after that day for him in Nashville and to see him perform then after get to watch the Get Up Kids is pretty great and feels normal again.\n\nWe’re not there yet but I hope I can see these two bands again and hopefully you as well at a show soon."
