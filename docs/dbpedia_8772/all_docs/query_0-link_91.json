        "text": "Dashboard Confessional frontman Chris Carrabba said Thursday he is recovering from “severe” injuries he suffered in a motorcycle accident on June 6.\n\n“I owe the amazing doctors, nurses and medical team treating me my endless gratitude,” the 45-year-old singer wrote in a message shared on the band’s social media. “I am determined to make a full recovery, but I have surgeries and months of rehab to come.”\n\nCarrabba did not provide any details about the accident but thanked five manufacturers of “the safety gear that protected my body in the crash.”\n\nHe added: “This will be difficult physically, emotionally and financially and I’m grateful to have your support as I go through it.”"
