Dashboard Confessional frontman Chris Carrabba has issued an apology for failing to comment on social issues affecting the United States. That’s not to say he’s missed anything recently; rather, his apology concerns comments he fails to make in the future.

Carrabba is in the hospital, recovering from serious injuries he suffered in a June 6th motorcycle accident. Although he says he expects to make a full recovery, getting there will likely take some time as he has “surgeries and months of rehab” ahead of him, he says. And he may have trouble keeping his finger on the pulse of society during that time, he says.

“I have not lost sight of the social issues at hand,” he tweeted from his hospital bed on Thursday. “And even in the condition I’m in, I find it important to state that I stand with Black Lives Matter. In the near future it is likely I will not be able to follow the news as much as I normally would. If you don’t hear from me on critical social issues, I trust that you will know where I stand.”

Do musicians’ stances on political issues affect how often you listen to their music? Do celebrities think they’re more important than they actually are?
