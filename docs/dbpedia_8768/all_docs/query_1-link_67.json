        "text": "Once a small Muslim town on the Asian shore of Bosporus, Üsküdar was a quasi-rural settlement known for its summer residences, beautiful vineyards, and gardens. From the second half of the sixteenth century onwards, Üsküdar became one of the most attractive suburbs of Istanbul for the building activities commissioned by the Ottoman imperial household. The increasing number of mosque complexes stimulated the region's urban development and transformed the rural Üsküdar into an urbanized town. As its boundaries began to extend towards the south-east direction, new neighborhoods were being formed, and the new settlers of the town altered the region's ethnoreligious composition. This study provides the first findings of my preliminary research for my dissertation on the spatial evolution of Mahalle-i Ma'mûre formed around Nurbanu Mosque Complex, the most significant imperial endowment in Üsküdar built between the years of 1570-79. The Muslim, Greek, Armenian, Jew, and Gypsy residents of Ma'mûre shared the same public sphere that linked them and shaped their identities and solidarity networks. Focusing on their occupations patterns, local networks, commercial activities, marriage, and divorce practices, I try to map different ethnic and religious communities within the neighborhood sociality through the lenses of judicial records within one year.\n\nI knew architecture grew since the ages of prehistoric and was the goal of the appearance of architecture at first in order to meet the need and protection from surrounding risks, but with the evolution of architecture through the ages, and the concept of civilization that appeared with the development of architecture gave a special identity to architecture. like Mesopotamia in Iraqi architecture, Egyptian architecture shows African, Romanian Greek, and Islamic architecture. The Byzantine Empire which covered most regions of the world saw the emergence of a very Christian architecture in Italy and the Vatican Gothic factor was the development of this architecture. Prothera next to the religious and ideological thought and philosophy closer to the god of, this architecture was thought the mainstream has actually contributed to the development of architecture during the ages. In this study, we will study the Islamic building in the North Africa region, which spread in the 10th century and was founded by The Abadites who were Kharijites and spread in the north of the Algerian desert, specifically in the city of Ghardaia in Wadi M'zab. 550 km from Algiers. This city is designed for social life, and this city is an inspiration for urban planners today. This city has been described in the Book of Lights Mazab of the French Orientalist where he said that her charm attracts visitors to it in one of the pages of this book. This architecture was characterized by: an inherent system of architecture, a mixture of practical creativity, which was characterized by steadfastness so as to stay adapted and adapted to the difficult climate and nature of the region, and the maintenance of the neighborhood rights supported by a arsenal of ethical systems and customs expressed in the harem. Both inside the palace or at specific distances outside their walls ... Which is covered by a beautiful aesthetic touch and an almost unique architectural feature. Through this study we will explain how They were affected of the building and the urban fabric of the area and the inhabitants of Wadi M'zab affected the religious dimension, how did urban fabric Wade M'zab preserve his building authenticity in terms of the form and mix of art and creativity that appears in urban and Wadi M'zab."
