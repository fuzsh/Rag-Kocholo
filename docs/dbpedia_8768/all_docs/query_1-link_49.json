        "text": "Medieval Serbia\n\nThe early Slav states\n\nThe unstable situation of the South Slavs, located as they were on the frontier between the Byzantine Empire and the seminomadic peoples of Asia, enabled them to assert some measure of independence. The basis of the Serbs’ social organization was the zadruga, or extended family. Several zadruge were grouped locally under a župan, or chieftain. Because kinship and locality played such a pivotal role in social organization, sustained collaboration within larger groups was difficult. Several župani might, on occasion, unite under a veliki župan, or grand chieftain, who for a short time would succeed in establishing control over a substantial territory and declare himself king or emperor.\n\nThe first such state to which Serbs attach a political identity was created by Vlastimir in about 850. This state was centred on an area in what is now eastern Montenegro and southern Serbia known as Raška and extended over the valleys of the Piva, Tara, Lim, and Ibar rivers (or roughly between the Durmitor and Kopaonik mountain ranges). The kingdom initially accepted the supremacy of Constantinople, which was subsequently torn by a contest between Simeon I, ruler of the first Bulgarian empire, and the veliki župan Česlav, leader of a rival Serb kingdom known as Zeta. After Česlav’s death, Byzantium again asserted control.\n\nThe significance of the early Serb protostates lies in their legacy of an enduring link between the Serb people and the Slavonic liturgical tradition of Orthodox Christianity. Christianity had been introduced into the Balkans during the Roman period, but the region had largely reverted to paganism by the time the Slavs arrived. There is some evidence that missionaries were active in the region as early as the 7th century. A more permanent Christian presence was achieved in the late 9th century, when the Byzantine emperor Michael III commissioned two brothers from Thessalonica, Cyril (Constantine) and Methodius, to evangelize the Slavs. Michael encouraged Cyril and Methodius to preach in the vernacular, and, to facilitate this task, they invented a script using the phonetic peculiarities of the Slavic tongue. Initially known as Glagolitic, the script was subsequently revised to employ characters resembling those of Greek and became known as Cyrillic.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe translation of the scriptures and liturgy was a key aspect of the dissemination of Christianity among Serbs. The influence of the Eastern church was assured over the greater part of the Balkans, and the use of the Cyrillic alphabet became one of the most visible cultural aspects separating Serbs (together with Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Montenegrins) from Croats and Slovenes.\n\nThe Golden Age\n\nAlthough the foundation of a Serbian state may be ascribed to the principality of Raška, a stable and continuous state appeared in this area only under Stefan Nemanja. Stefan assumed the throne of Raška in 1168, but he continued to acknowledge the supremacy of Byzantium until 1185. In 1196 he abdicated in favour of his son Stefan (known as Prvovenčani, the “First-Crowned”), who in 1217 secured from Pope Honorius III the title of “king of Serbia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia.” Under the Nemanjić dynasty, which was to rule the Serb lands for the next 200 years, a powerful state emerged to dominate the entire Balkan Peninsula. It was founded, in part, on the ability and administrative capacity of its rulers and also on the establishment of a link between church and state.\n\nThe rise of the Nemanjić dynasty was facilitated by the defeat of the Byzantine Empire, under the impact of the Fourth Crusade (1204), and the creation of a short-lived Latin empire. Even after the fortunes of Byzantium were revived after 1261, the primary frontier of Nemanjić expansion lay to the south. Power was seized and consolidated through opportunities offered by a weak Constantinople, and the kingdom extended its authority over an assortment of peoples. Skopje in Macedonia was taken in 1282 by Stefan Uroš II and became the Serb capital. Under the reign of Stefan Dušan (1331–55), the Nemanjić state reached its greatest extent, incorporating Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia, all of modern Albania and Montenegro, a substantial part of eastern Bosnia, and modern Serbia as far north as the Danube. Dušan adopted the title of emperor at his coronation in Skopje in 1346 (later “emperor and autocrat of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, and Albanians”), but he is more commonly remembered by Serbs as Dušan Silni, or “Dušan the Mighty.” To this day, the Serbs consider the empire of Dušan Silni as the Golden Age of their nation. All the Balkan states during the Middle Ages modeled themselves on, and saw themselves as the supplanters of, Byzantium. This was no less true for the Serbian state, as reflected in the titles that its monarchs took for themselves and bestowed on their subordinates and as evidenced in the famous Zakonik (code of laws) that Dušan promulgated in 1349, which fused the law of Constantinople with Serb folk custom.\n\nThrough the union of church and state, the Serb emperors strove to imitate and ultimately rival the status of the ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople. An autocephalous church was declared in 1219, with its seat at Žiča, near modern Kraljevo, and Sava, the youngest son of Stefan Nemanja, was named archbishop and later was canonized as St. Sava. (The monastery he built there was later designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO.) The Serbian church thus separated from the Bulgarian-influenced archbishopric of Ohrid. In order to escape the harassment of Tatar raiding parties, the seat of the ecclesiastical order of Nemanjić was later moved southward to Peć, in the Metohija Plain. In 1375 the archbishop of Peć was raised to the status of patriarch, in spite of the pronouncement of an anathema by Constantinople. During this time great churches and monasteries were endowed—particularly the Mileševo (c. 1235), Peć (1250), Morača (1252), Sopoćani (c. 1260), Dečani (1327), and Gračanica (1321) monasteries. Those sites have subsequently come to constitute important symbolic monuments for Serbs. The frescoes of the Raška school, in particular, are known for their capacity to blend secular authority with a deep sense of devotion. Literary work extended beyond copying manuscripts to include pieces of independent creative merit, such as the biography of Stefan Nemanja prepared by St. Sava and his brother Stefan Prvovenčani. Courtly culture became religious culture; both church and state benefited from this partnership and created a “civilization” of their own.\n\nEconomic growth also contributed to the consolidation of Nemanjić power. Such crops as hemp, flax, grapes, and oil-yielding plants became more widespread. The plains of Kosovo and Metohija became areas of a fairly dense, overwhelmingly Serb, population and extensive agriculture, and mining grew considerably in importance. Not only gold and silver but also copper and tin had been exploited since Roman times, but production rose to meet the new demands of imperial courts and centres of ecclesiastical authority. Although this wealth supported a remarkably modest court, it also sustained substantial military forces. Trade expanded, particularly in the hands of Ragusan and Italian merchants, who led caravans along the old Roman routes.\n\nConquest by the Ottoman Turks\n\nThe glories of the Nemanjić empire were short-lived. In 1354 the Ottoman Empire gained a foothold on the European mainland, and, by the time of Dušan’s death in 1355, the Turkish march northward had already begun. Dušan’s successors were unable to sustain his achievements, and almost immediately the state began to disintegrate under rival clan leaders. The fall of Adrianople (modern Edirne, Turkey) to Turkish troops shocked the several factions into briefly uniting under Vukašin, the king of the southern Serbian lands, and his brother John Uglješa, the despot of Serres (modern Sérrai, Greece); their forces were eventually defeated in 1371 at the Battle of the Maritsa River (Battle of Chernomen), in which both leaders were killed.\n\nThe Ottoman conquest of the Balkan Peninsula was not a smooth progression. South Slav leaders were frequently willing to ally themselves with the Ottomans in the hope of securing aid against rivals. In this way they were able to retain a nominal independence for some years in return for a variety of forms of vassalage. One of the most celebrated of these leaders was Marko Kraljević, the son of Vukašin and a chieftain of Prilep, who was immortalized in many of the heroic folk ballads of Serbia and Macedonia. In 1387 or 1388 a combined force of Serbs, Bosnians, and Bulgarians inflicted a heavy defeat on the Ottoman army at Pločnik, but a turning point came when the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman broke with the alliance of Slavic powers and accepted Ottoman suzerainty. No longer threatened from the east, the armies of Sultan Murad I were able to concentrate their weight against Serb resistance. Led by the Serb knez, or prince, Lazar Hrebeljanović (he did not claim Dušan’s imperial title), a combined army of Serbs, Albanians, and Hungarians met Murad’s forces in battle. On St. Vitus’s Day (Vidovdan), June 28 (June 15, Old Style), 1389, at Kosovo Polje, the Serbs and their allies suffered a defeat that has become hallowed in several great heroic ballads. The vision of Lazar on the eve of the battle, the alleged betrayal by the Bosnian Vuk Branković, the killing of Murad by Miloš Obilić, the succour brought to the wounded on the battlefield by the Maid of Kosovo—these and other stories have been immortalized in Serbian folk literature. They have become lenses through which subsequent creators of national mythology have come to see their past and imagine the attributes of the nation in essentially spiritual terms. Kosovo became (especially during the 19th century) the Jerusalem of the Serbs.\n\nForced to accept the position of vassals to the Turks, Serb despots continued to rule a diminished state of Raška, at first from Belgrade and then from Smederevo. Serbian resistance did not end until the fall of Smederevo in 1459.\n\nLife in the Ottoman period\n\nThe period of Ottoman domination was dismissed by earlier Serb historians as the centuries of “Turkish night,” but it remains significant for the manner in which it shaped Serb national consciousness and influenced the future development of the Serbian state.\n\nTwo centuries of military struggle for the control of the Balkan Peninsula had depopulated large tracts of the former Serb lands. Other peoples moved into these areas (either spontaneously or under Turkish sponsorship); their task was to till the land and support the spahis, a dispersed levy of armed horsemen on which the Ottoman feudal system depended. At the centre of the system was the sultan and his court—often referred to as “the Sublime Porte” (or simply “the Porte”)—based in Constantinople after its capture in 1453. The administrative structure of the system revolved around the extraction of revenues principally in order to support the court and its attendant military caste. All authority and the right to enjoy possessions were regarded as deriving from the sultan, who “leased” them to subordinates at his own will and to whom these rights reverted upon the death of the lessee. The most common leasing arrangement was the tımar. The tımarlı held the right to support themselves from taxes raised in their area. Typically, the holder of such a position was a spahi, who from the income of his territory was expected to support his forces in a state of readiness for the service of the sultan.\n\nWith some local exceptions, no attempt was made to spread Islam by the sword in the conquered territories. There was again a long and slow process of assimilation of sections of the Slavic-speaking population (including the aristocracy) to Islam. All Muslims were regarded as belonging to a single community of the faithful, the ummah, and any person could join the ruling group by converting to Islam. Each non-Muslim religious community was called a millet, and Ottoman administration recognized five such groups: Orthodox, Gregorian Armenian, Latin (Roman Catholic), Jewish, and Protestant. Each group was under the direction of its religious head. The Serbs, being Orthodox, had as their titular head the patriarch of Constantinople. With the passage of time, however, ethnic identity was recognized by the Ottoman authorities, and the patriarchate in Constantinople became a specifically Greek centre. The Serbs had their own patriarchate at Peć. Ecclesiastical authorities were expected to assume many civil functions, including administering justice, collecting taxes, and, later, providing education.\n\nThe Ottoman authorities would later rule through local knezes, who were Christian “princes” or “headmen.” A knez might act as a negotiator for taxation with the authorities, as a kind of justice of the peace, as an intermediary in the organization of labour obligations, or as a spokesman for the Christian population in dispute with the local aga or bey. In times of civil disturbance, despite the normal interdiction on the bearing of arms by Christians, a knez might even be responsible for raising detachments of loyal subjects to fight for the Porte. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the institution of the knez became one of the most important symbolic focuses and practical resources around which Christian resistance could grow.\n\nThe situation of the Christian reaya (literally “flock”) was not one of unmitigated oppression. Christians were exempted from military service, and in some regions the tax burden was lighter than it had been previously, although they were taxed more heavily than the Muslim population. It was even possible for subject peoples to rise within the system, provided that they converted, and there were several notable grand viziers of South Slav origin. One common route of advancement was the system of devşirme, which involved the periodic conscription of Christian boys between the ages of 10 and 20. The boys were taken to Constantinople, converted to Islam, and employed in a variety of posts. The most able would be trained for administrative positions, while the others joined the corps of Janissaries (Yeniçeri). The Janissary corps was an elite order of infantrymen that, as firearms became more significant in warfare, came to be the most effective part of the Ottoman military.\n\nOttoman territory was principally rural in character, the majority of the population living on small family farms or in pastoral communities that produced little marketable surplus. Towns were with very few exceptions small, and in the Serb lands their culture was shaped by non-Serb groups, such as the Turks (in military, administrative, or craft occupations) and, in commerce, the Greeks, Ragusans, Vlachs, or Jews. The Ottoman authorities did little to promote trade or manufacturing, with the significant exception of encouraging the production of provisions for the army or Constantinople. Literacy was generally confined to the clergy. As a consequence, the majority of the population remained differentiated into local peasant communities characterized by their own dialects, dress, and customs.\n\nThe disintegration of Ottoman rule\n\nOttoman conquest did not mean the end of armed resistance on the part of the South Slav peoples. Poor harvests and a rapacious nobility frequently brought on local revolts by the reaya; in addition, individuals accused of crimes or protesting injustice would characteristically head for the hills or forests to live the life of the haiduk, or outlaw. Both of these forms of resistance increased from the 17th century, when the territorial expansion of the Ottoman Empire was reversed and Ottoman warriors withdrawing toward the core of the empire found themselves in growing competition with one another for limited resources. Armed uprisings by the peasantry were particularly common in northern areas such as the Morava River valley, where imperial control was weakest and the Janissaries least disciplined. The greatest of these revolts took place in 1690, when Serbs rose in support of an Austrian invasion. The Habsburg forces, unable to sustain their advance, retreated back across the Sava, leaving the native population seriously exposed to Turkish reprisals. In 1691 Archbishop Arsenije III Crnojević of Peć led a migration of 30,000–40,000 Serbs from “Old Serbia” and southern Bosnia across the Danube and Sava. There they were settled and became the basis of the Austrian Militärgrenze, or Military Frontier. (The South Slav translation, Vojna Krajina, was used 300 years later in the name given to the areas of Croatia that local Serb majorities attempted to disconnect from Croatia following its secession from Yugoslavia.) Also dating from the time of the great migration of 1691 was the gradual conversion of Kosovo-Metohija into a predominantly Albanian region as Albanians filled the space left by the displaced Serbs.\n\nPartly because of the contacts between Serb clergy and the Ottomans, the sultan abolished the patriarchate of Peć in 1766, and an attempt was made to place the Serbian church under the authority of the Greek patriarch in Constantinople. In response, newly established monasteries in Srem, a region between the Sava and Danube under Austrian control, took on part of the role of Peć as a centre of ecclesiastical authority. The town of Sremski Karlovci, in particular, grew to be a primary centre of learning and of Serb cultural identity.\n\nWhen war broke out between the Ottomans and an alliance of Russia and Austria in 1787, the Austrian emperor called upon the Serbs to rise once more against the Turks, which they did with some success. The Treaties of Sistova (1791) and Jassy (1792), which concluded hostilities, included guarantees of the rights of the Serb population, including the expulsion of the Janissaries from the pashalic of Belgrade. These provisions were never fully respected, however, and the region steadily sank into disorder.\n\nThe nascent Serbian state\n\nBy the last quarter of the 18th century, the disintegration of Ottoman rule had produced a highly unstable situation in Serbia. In northern Serbia local Janissaries were virtually beyond the control of the Porte, and their exactions passed from the collection of taxes to open plunder. In 1804 an uprising broke out in the Šumadija region, south of Belgrade; it was led by Djordje Petrović, called Karadjordje (“Black George”), a successful pig trader who had served with the Austrians in the war against Turkey in 1787–88. In 1805 a Skupština (assembly) was summoned, and it submitted a list of proposals to the sultan. The proposals included a number of demands for local autonomy that were unacceptable to the sultan, and a large force was sent to quell the rebellion. The rebels continued to hold out and were strengthened by the arrival of Russian reinforcements in 1808. Threatened by Napoleon’s invasion in 1812, however, Tsar Alexander I concluded a treaty with the Turks. The withdrawal of Russia left the Serbs open to Ottoman reprisals, and Karadjordje and his men were compelled to retreat across the Danube.\n\nThe return of the Turks was accompanied by a widespread reign of terror, and the Christian population rose again in self-defense in April 1815. Under the leadership of another knez, MilošObrenović, this rebellion succeeded in driving the Turks from a wide area of northern Serbia. Faced with renewed Russian intervention following the defeat of Napoleon, the Porte made several important concessions to the rebels, including the retention of their arms, considerable powers of local administration, and the right to hold their own assembly. The firmans (decrees from the Porte) granted to Obrenović did not amount to the creation of an independent state, however. The region remained an Ottoman principality, with a resident pasha and Turkish garrisons in the principal towns.\n\nDespite their limitations, the two uprisings would nonetheless remain seminal events in the formation of national consciousness around a modern Serbian state."
