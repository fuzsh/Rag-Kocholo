        "text": "Dardania\n\nPresent North Macedonia covers the main part of the territory of Roman Dardania. Its capital Scupi was destroyed by an earthquake in 518.\n\nScupi became the capital of Dardania, which extended from Naissus to Bylazora, in the second century BC The Dardanians had remained independent after the Roman conquest of Macedonia, because they had supported the Romans, hoping to enlarge their territory in this way. It is not clear when the Romans finally annexed Dardania and it seems most likely that the Dardani actually lost independence in 28 BC Scupi grew up as a colony of legionnaires, mainly veterans of the Legio VII Claudia in the time of Domitian (AD 8196), even though several legions of Crassus' army of 29-28 BC, may already have been stationed there, before the official imperial command in this area was instituted. Scupi was included in Moesia Superior after the province was formed in AD 6. From 272 AD, it was a colony inside the Roman province of Dardania after Dardania was established. Scupi was ravaged several times by barbarians, in AD 269 by the Goths, in 5th century by the Huns and finally in the year 518 was completely destroyed by an earthquake. Life in Scupi stopped after the earthquake and it is assumed that the people from Scupi moved to live on Kale, a hill in the center of Skopje.[5]\n\nGallienus coin, celebrating LEG VII CLA VI P VI F\n\n(Seventh legion Claudia, six times faithful, six times loyal,\n\nand bearing the bull, symbol of the legion, on the reverse.\n\nIn the late Roman Empire, the province of Dardania, with its capital Scupi (Skoplje), belonged to the prefecture of Illyricum and the diocese of Dacia. This diocese was split again into the provinces of Moesia I, Dacia mediterranea, Dacia Ripuaria, Prævalitana and Dardania. The province of Dardania came to Byzantium after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the twelfth century Macedonia became part of Bulgaria. which declared its independence in 1186 and became a kingdom in 1203. However,the country disintegrated again in the course of the thirteenth century and Macedonia returned to Byzantium\n\nNotitia Dignitatum fol 197v: Credentials of the Dux Moesia I. Forts under the command of the Dux Moesia I: Flaviana, Pinco, Tricornio, Aureomonto, Viminacio, Laederata, Cuppis, Ad Novas\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395AD, Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople and became an important trading and garrison town for the region. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian (527-565AD) was born in Tauresium (about 20 km southeast of present-day Skopje) in 483AD, and after Scupi was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in 518 AD. Justinian built a new town at the fertile entry point of the River Lepenec into the Vardar.\n\nSkopje was a capital of the estate of the Bulgarian feudal lord, later Emperor Konstantin Asen Tikh (r.1257-77) in the middle of the 13th century. The Byzantine Empire took advantage of the decline in Skopje to regain influence in the area, but lost control of it once again in 1282 to King Stefan Uro II Milutin of Serbia. Milutin's grandson, Stefan Dusan, made Skopje his capital, from which he proclaimed himself Tsar in 1346.\n\nConstantine I was the son of a nobleman named Tih (short for Tihomir or the like) and probably a descendant of a Skopje notable named Tihomir, who lived at the beginning of the 13th century. Through his mother, Constantine was descended from Stefan Nemanja of Serbia.\n\nIn 1257, Constantine was elected by the nobles (boyars) to replace the ineffective Mitso Asen as emperor of Bulgaria. By 1261 Mitso Asen was decisively defeated, and sought asylum with Michael VIII Palaiologos, the emperor of Nicaea. To enhance his position as legitimate ruler, Constantine adopted the name Asen and married Eirene of Nicaea, a daughter of emperor Theodore II Doukas Laskaris by Elena of Bulgaria, the daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria.\n\nn the monastery of St. Demetrius in Markov near Skopje, the construction of which was started in 1346 by Vukain and his son Marko Kraljevic, on the altar was a tile depicting in low relief a double eagle between two lions. A chandelier in the same church was hung on links with alternately the monogram of Vukasin and a double eagle. [2] When we combine these facts with Guilelmus Soleri's map from 1385 (possibly copied from Angelino Dulcerta), Vukasin's eagle would also have been red on a gold field.\n\nThe two headed eagle which was the badge of a Megalou Primikuriou which in fact was the title of the chief of ceremonies and the commander of the central imperial Byzantine regiments This is in keeping with the practice in Byzantium where a red eagle was the symbol of the co-emperor or basileus\n\nMarkov Monastery Skopje\n\nTwo-headed eagle on a candelabrum\n\nOn 26 September 1371, Vukain was killed and his forces defeated in the Battle of Maritsa. About two months later, Tsar Uro died. This formally made Marko the king of the Serbian land; however, Serbian noblemen, who had become effectively independent from the central authority, did not even consider to recognise him as their supreme ruler. Sometime after 1371, he became an Ottoman vassal; by 1377, significant portions of the territory he inherited from Vukain were seized by other noblemen. King Marko, in reality, came to be a regional lord who ruled over a relatively small territory in western Macedonia. He funded the construction of the Monastery of Saint Demetrius near Skopje (better known as Marko's Monastery), which was completed in 1376. Marko died on 17 May 1395, fighting for the Ottomans against the Wallachians in the Battle of Rovine.\n\nKonstantin (Kostadin) Dejanović fl.1365-1395) also known as Constantine Draga, was a Serbian magnat that ruled a large province in eastern Macedonia under Ottoman suzerainty, after the fall of the Serbian Empire. He succeeded his older brother Jovan Draga, who had been an Ottoman vassal since the Battle of Maritsa (1371) which had devastated part of the Serbian nobility. The brothers had their own government and minted coins according to the Nemanjić style. His daughter Jelena married Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos in 1392. He fell at the Battle of Rovine (17 May 1395), serving the Ottomans against Wallachia, fighting alongside Serbian magnates Stefan Lazarević and Marko Mrnjavčević.\n\nRoyal portraits: f. 2v: Constantine Dejanovic ( 1395), the son-in-law of Tsar Ivan Alexander, dressed in a purple himation strewn with white two-headed eagles flanked by three daughters of the tsar: Kerathamar (Constantine's wife), Keratsa and Desislava from the Gospels of Ivan Alexander, Bulgaria, 1355-1356, Add MS 39627, ff. 2v-3r[3]\n\nIn the eighties of the fourteenth century Macedonia was conquered by the Ottomans. It is possible that under Ottoman rule, the Brankovic family, who controlled Kosovo, came to occupy an important place after the battle on at Kosovo Polje in 1389. It is certain that the Branković' became vassals of the Turkish Sultan.\n\nSkopje (Üsküb) had previously been the capital of the Serbian Empire between 1346 and 1371.\n\nThe Brankovic crest was a lion passant. It is on the seal of Vuk Brankovic (*1345- 1397) of 20 January 1387. This lion also appears on later seals of the family, still as a crest. [4]\n\nSeal of Vuk Brankovic 20.01.1387\n\nLion passsant\n\nThe District of Branković or Vuk's Land was one of the short lived semi-independent states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in 1371, following the death of the last Emperor Uro the Weak (1346-1371). The founder of this realm was Vuk Branković, the son of sebastokrator Branko Mladenović who governed Ohrid under Stefan Duan the Mighty (1331-1346). Through Vuk's marriage with Mara, the daughter of Moravian Serbia's Prince Lazar, he was given substantial lands to govern in Kosovo.\n\nThe Realm of Branković was located in the largest part of today's Kosovo. Vuk also governed eastern parts of the Raka region (including the old Serbian capital Ras) and lands in Polimlje, in present-day northern Montenegro, as well a Skoplje. After the death of Đurađ I Balić of Zeta, Vuk captured cities of Prizren and Peć and the area of Metohija. The most important cities in Vuk's Realm were Pritina, Prizren, Peć, Skopje and Ras, as well as the rich mining settlements of Novo Brdo, Trepča, Janjevo, Gluhavica and others.\n\nThe semi-independent lordship ceased to exist as such with the establishment of Serbian Despotate by Stefan Lazarević. Still, the Branković yielded a very significant amount of power in the state, controlling most of Serbia's extremely rich mining sites. Đurađ Branković inherited the title of Serbian despot as Stefan died childless.\n\nThe Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century, which was seized by the Ottomans at the end of the same century. Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the Ottoman Empire and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or Eyalet of Rumelia. The name Rumelia (Rumeli) means \"Land of the Romans\" in Turkish, referring to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Turks from the Byzantine Empire. Over the centuries Rumelia Eyalet was reduced in size through administrative reforms, until by the 19th century it consisted of a region of central Albania and western North Macedonia with its capital at Manastir or present-day Bitola. Rumelia Eyalet was abolished in 1867 and that territory of Macedonia subsequently became part of the province of Manastir Vilayet until the end of Ottoman rule in 1912. With the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival in the 19th century, many of the reformers were from this region, including the Miladinov brothers,[ Rajko inzifov, Joakim Krčovski, Kiril Pejčinoviḱ and others. The bishoprics of Skopje, Debar, Bitola, Ohrid, Veles, and Strumica voted to join the Bulgarian Exarchate after it was established in 1870.\n\nÜsküb Sanjak in Rumeli ca. 1650\n\nÜsküb (Skopje) became part of Ottoman Empire after it was captured from the District of Branković on 6 January 1392. The first Ottoman governor of Skopje was Pasha Yiğit Bey, who conquered Skopje for the Ottoman Empire. The next one was Isak-Beg who was sent to lead military actions in Serbia in spring of 1439, and was replaced by his son Isa-Beg Isaković in the position of sanjakbeg of the Sanjak of Skopje.[4]\n\nThe sanjak was initially formed as the so-called krajite (Skopsko Krajite; lit. borderland of Skopje) that was transformed into a full sanjak in the mid-16th century.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Sançak of Üsküp had often been given to beylerbeys as arpalik. Up to the 19th century, the sanjak was part of the Eyalet of Rumelia.\n\nUprisings against the Ottoman government occurred in the sanjak in 1572, 1584, 1585 and 1595. During the Great Turkish War, Austrian general Silvio Piccolomini burnt down Skopje in 1689.\n\nIn 1868 the Sanjak of Skopje together with the Sanjaks of Prizren, Dibra and Ni became part of the newly established Prizren Vilayet. When Kosovo Vilayet was established in 1877, the Prizren Vilayet (without several nahiyas annexed by Serbia) and its Sanjak of Skopje became part of Kosovo Vilayet, with Skopje as its seat.\n\nDuring the First Balkan War in 1912 and the beginning of 1913, the Sanjak of Skopje was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia. On the basis of the Treaty of London signed during the London Conference in 1913, its territory became a part of Serbia.\n\nThe earliest governors, of the so-called Skopje krajite:\n\nPasha Yiğit Bey: (13921414)\n\nIshak Bey: (14141439)\n\nNesuh Bey: (14391454)\n\nIsa-Beg Ishaković: (14541463)\n\nSançaks at the Battle of Vienna, 1683\n\nA coat of arms for (historical) Dardania in which Üsküb Sançak was situated, was given by Ritter Vitezovic after the Battele of Vienna (1683) in the Köprülü Era (16561703), during which effective control of the Ottoman Empire was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the Köprülü family.\n\nArms of Dardania (1695-1701)\n\nArms: Argent, a crowned lion rampant reversed Gules armed with a spear.\n\nCrown: A royal crown [5]\n\nThe Trojans land, the King gave names\n\nHe was born, on the one side of Priam, Dardanus, progenitor\n\npoprio now lies in the soil itself bereft of the old\n\nname; Troy are only ruins\n\nFrom: Vitezovic, Ritter, Paulus alias: Stemmatographia, sive armorum Illyricorum delineatio, descriptio et restitutio, 1701.

For this people's republic a coat of arms of the Soviet model was in use.\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Republic of Macedonia represents the sun of freedom rising above Macedonia, just as mentioned in the national anthem. In forefront of the shield is the Shar mountain, and the waters of Lake Ohrid. The shield is surrounded with wheat and poppy plants and on the basis with a ribon of a Macedonian national motif, often found on the Macedonian national outfits (dresses)\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Peoples Republic of Macedonia was adopted by law at the second special session of the Peoples Assembly on 26 July 1946 in Skopje. (Prezidium na narodnoto sobranie na Narodna Republika Makedonija, Zakon za grbot na Narodna Republika Makedonija, br 559, Skopje 27 Juli 1946)\n\nArticle 1 of this law gives the description of these Arms:\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Peoples Republic of Macedonia is a field surrounded by stalks of wheat interwoven with fruits of opium poppy and tobacco leaves, which at the bottom are connected with a ribbon with folk design. The ribbon bears the text  N. R. Makedonija (P. R. Macedonia). Between the top of the stalks of wheat there is a five- pointed star. In the center of the field a mountain is outlined, at the bottom of which a river is flowing. Behind the mountain there is a sunrise.\n\nIn Nova Makedonija, (The only daily newspaper of that time which was the gazette of the Peoples Front)# 482, 28 July 1946, a wider explanation is given, formulated as follows:\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Peoples Republic of Macedonia is symbol of freedom and brotherhood of the Macedonian people and the riches of the Macedonian land. The stalks of wheat, opium poppies and tobacco leaves represent the riches of Macedonia and the diversity of its economy. The five-pointed star is a symbol of the peoples liberation war by which the Macedonian people won its freedom. The folklore motif on the ribbon is representing the richness and beauty of the peoples essence. In the middle, there is Pirin mountain, the largest Macedonian mountain, which was the centre of peoples liberation wars in the past, and the river that flows, is the Vardar river, the most famous river in the Republic. Pirin and Vardar at the same time represent the unity of all parts of Macedonia and the ideal of the Macedonian people for national unification. The sun represent the freedom and the creative life of Macedonia. [6]\n\nWhen Yugoslavia fell apart Macedonia declared its independence in 1992 but it retained the coat of arms adopted in 1946\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Republic of Macedonia was adopted on 16 November 2009, by adoption of the Law of the Coat of Arms and Flag of the Republic of Macedonia (Official Gazette No. 138 of 17 November 2009).\n\n2009-11-16\n\nArticle 2 describes the Coat of Arms as follows:\n\n(1) The Coat of Arms of the Republic of Macedonia is a field surrounded with wheat sheafs that merge at the top, interwoven with poppy and tobacco leaves, connected at the bottom with a ribbon of a folk pattern.\n\n(2) In the middle of the field is a mountain is outlined with a river at its foot, and sunrise behind it.\n\nA new, third article is added, stating:\n\nThe design of the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Macedonia is an integral part of this Law.[7]\n\nActually, this is only the removal of the red five pointed star off the Arms on the Peoples Republic of Macedonia from 1946.\n\nThe name Macedonia was mainly objected by Greece because the historical kingdom of that name (650 BC - 168 AD) would have been Greek and claims to the Greek part of Macedonia were feared. The names proposed were \"Republic of Skopje\" or \"Republic of Macedonia-Skopje\". On 4 November 2004, the press reported that the US had decided to name FYROM Macedonia from now on. and the republic is now known internationally as FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) pending final settlement of the state name\n\nIn state symbolism, the republic indeed harks back to the historical kingdom. The flag, known since 1992, features the so-called \"Star of Vergina\", which appears in the burial place of Alexander the Great's father, Philip II (359-336). This star (sun) can be considered to be the state symbol of the Empire of Alexander the Great that included Persia in addition to Macedonia.\n\nThe flag is dark red, the star has sixteen points and is yellow / gold, the medallion in the center white with gold edges and with a blue six-leaf rosette.\n\nThe coat of arms of the republic is the coat of arms with the golden crowned lion on a red field and covered with a crown.\n\nAs for the symbol on the flag, the republic had to back down due to international pressure. The flag is now a yellow shining sun on a red field.\n\nOn the governments session of 5 December 2014 a new poposal for a coat of arms of the Republic of Macedonia was put forward based on Macedonias heraldic heritage.\n\nThis showed the 18th century lion gules from Ritter Vitezovic, however with a mural crown instead of a roya crown.\n\n2014-12-05\n\nOn 15 (or 13) June 2018 an agreement was reached on the renaming of the area in North Macedonia\n\n2018"
