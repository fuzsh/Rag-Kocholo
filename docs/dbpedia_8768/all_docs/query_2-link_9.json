Heraclea Lyncestis is the original settlement, and the well-preserved ruins are one of the biggest historical attractions in the country. Originally founded by Philip II of Macedon and then ruled by the Romans before becoming a Byzantine hub and then the regional capital of the Ottoman Empire, Bitola is one of the most diverse parts of Macedonia which can be seen through its architecture, culture and cuisine."
