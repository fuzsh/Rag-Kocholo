        "text": "Packed to the rafters with bars, cafes and restaurants, no trip to Bitola is complete without a walk down Širok Sokak.\n\nThis thriving thoroughfare is the city’s main street and is regarded as the thriving centre of the area’s cultural and social scene. Whether looking for a morning espresso or an evening cocktail, Bitola residents make the daily pilgrimage to Širok Sokak in their tens of thousands to refuel, re-energise and reconnect with friends and family.\n\nThe immense street stretches for nearly one kilometre from north to south through the city. During our visit to Bitola, we couldn’t help but spend most of our time exploring everything Širok Sokak had to offer.\n\nFrom our favourite cafes and restaurants to the best things to do, here is our guide to Širok Sokak.\n\nWhy you must visit Širok Sokak during your Bitola trip\n\n1) It is possibly the most famous street in North Macedonia\n\nDuring our travels around North Macedonia, we were lucky to chat with plenty of people along the way. Whenever we mentioned Bitola, we were asked if we enjoyed Širok Sokak. Our answer? “Of course!”\n\nIt was certainly our favourite street of the trip – a place where we felt relaxed, energised and at the heart of the city’s social scene.\n\n2) It is pedestrianised\n\nBusy roads and constant traffic jams can often be a feature of city centres in the Balkans. By contrast, Širok Sokak is entirely pedestrianised – except for a couple of main roads that dissect the street.\n\nIt is lovely to be in the midst of the city and not have to worry about the traffic. With the exception of the occasional bicycle haphazardly swerving among the crowds, Širok Sokak belongs to pedestrians.\n\n3) The cafes are brilliant\n\nŠirok Sokak is famous for its cafes. At any one time, thousands of locals can sit shoulder-to-shoulder on small tables, spilling out across the pavements.\n\nSome choose to sit with an espresso and a cigarette. Others nurse an iced coffee and a slice of cake. Regardless of your chosen drink, the cafe culture in Bitola will keep you coming back to Širok Sokak day after day.\n\n4) Some of Bitola’s best sights are on or just off Širok Sokak.\n\nBitola is a wonderfully compact city, easily navigated on foot. Its star attraction – the ruined, ancient city of Heraclea – is tucked away on the outskirts. However, the remaining sights can be found within a few minutes walk from Širok Sokak.\n\nKeep reading to get the low-down on our favourite things to see and do around Širok Sokak.\n\n4 of the best cafes on Širok Sokak\n\nFrom classic cocktails to excellent coffee, here are four of our favourite spots on Širok Sokak to enjoy the city’s cafe culture.\n\n1) GT Caffe\n\nBest for: A relaxed, family-friendly spot.\n\nWhen we visited, we felt the GT Caffe had a more family-oriented atmosphere than other spots further down the street. Parents and grandparents sat with young children, keeping them occupied with smartphones or plastic toys.\n\nThe coffee was good, and they seemed to be doing a roaring trade in ice cream – even on chilly evenings.\n\n2) Café Pajton\n\nBest for: People watching.\n\nArguably the busiest cafe on Širok Sokak, Café Pajton is an ideal place to people-watch with an espresso. At street level, tables and comfy chairs are packed close together. Next to the windows, a slightly elevated section is home to tall tables and stools.\n\nMost people come here to nurse a drink, smoke a cigarette and have a chat with a friend. For a quintessentially ‘Bitola’ experience, it doesn’t get much better than this.\n\n3) Slatkarnika GT\n\nBest for: Coffee and cake.\n\nProbably the best place on Širok Sokak for cakes and pastries, Slatkarnika has carved out a loyal following among the people of Bitola.\n\nFrom almond cake to cheesecake, you will likely find people nursing a sweet treat alongside an espresso or tea. During the summer months, the ice cream stand does a roaring trade.\n\n4) Cafe Aero\n\nBest for: A stylish hangout with great coffee and cocktails.\n\nWe came to Cafe Aero with our big bags before catching the bus to Krusevo. The service was very friendly, the coffee and tea were excellent and their fresh orange juice was ideal for a morning treat.\n\nIn the evening, Cafe Aero is a very popular spot for cocktails, with every table occupied.\n\nWhere to eat on Širok Sokak\n\nWhilst most cafes and bars on Širok Sokak offer a food menu, keep in mind that people primarily come here to drink coffee or cocktails. Even if you grab yourself a table in a place packed with locals, there may only be one or two groups eating a main meal.\n\nIndeed, we found that there were only a handful of places where the majority of tables had ordered food. Thankfully, the meals in those spots served good quality dishes in pleasant surroundings. Here are three of our favourites.\n\n1) Pizza Sweden\n\nBest for: Quick, cheap food you can eat on the go.\n\nWith just a couple of small tables outside, Pizza Sweden is primarily a takeaway. It does a roaring trade in the evenings, with countless people wandering up and down Širok Sokak clutching small pizza boxes.\n\nIf you’re looking to blend in with the locals on a warm summer’s evening, Pizza Sweden is an ideal spot to grab a quick snack whilst strolling around Bitola.\n\n2) Kus Kus\n\nBest for: A busy eatery serving international food.\n\nA 30-second detour from Širok Sokak, Kus Kus is probably the best ‘all-rounder’ restaurant around Bitola’s main street. Tucked away down a side street, Kus Kus boasts a small outdoor terrace as well as plenty of room indoors.\n\nThe menu ranges from pizza and burgers to salads and risotto – there is something for everyone. Whilst it’s not mind-blowing, you will at least be surrounded by other people who are also eating.\n\n3) Ravenna\n\nBest for: Traditional cuisine.\n\nHalfway down Širok Sokak, Ravenna is an ideal place to try some traditional Balkan dishes. While much of the menu is packed with pizza and pasta, there is also a good selection of Macedonian specialities. We had kebapi and two pork dishes, which were both excellent. Service was a little slow but generally friendly and helpful.\n\nNote: The tables at Ravenna spill out onto the main street, which means you can occasionally expect a visit from a stray dog or two. There is plenty of room inside if you prefer.\n\nWhere to stay on Širok Sokak\n\nIt is worth keeping in mind that Širok Sokak is almost constantly busy. Indeed, it is at its most lively in the evenings. Therefore, it’s worth deciding whether you’re happy to have some city noise while trying to sleep.\n\nThere are plenty of options in Bitola that are a short walk away from Širok Sokak. However, if you want to stay on the main street, here are three of the best options.\n\n1) Hotel Épinal\n\nBest for: A reassuringly large hotel with food and drink options.\n\nOn the corner of one of the busy vehicular roads that crosses Širok Sokak, Hotel Épinal is at the heart of the action in Bitola. On the ground floor, the restaurant and terrace spill out onto the street, so you can enjoy your coffee without ever needing to leave. However, prices are a little higher than other cafés. Meanwhile, for those looking to keep up appearances, the hotel boasts an on-site gym and spa.\n\nNote: As of late 2023, the rooms at the Hotel Épinal are undergoing renovations. The restaurant remains open.\n\n2) Stone Bridge Apartments\n\nBest for: A budget-friendly stay with great hosts.\n\nFor those wanting self-catering, Stone Bridge Apartments offers a selection of rooms halfway down Širok Sokak. Hosted by Stefan and Aleksandar, a stay here is a great way to connect with some Bitola locals who are happy to help you get to grips with the city.\n\nThe accommodation is simple and straightforward, with everything you need for a short stay. Rooms from £36 a night.\n\nNote: The rooms are more like studios than full-sized apartments. This is normal for accommodation like this in North Macedonia.\n\n3) Robevski Luxury Rooms\n\nBest for: A touch of grandeur in the middle of Bitola.\n\nLocated towards the top end of Širok Sokak, Robevski Luxury Rooms is a family-run hotel offering opulent accommodation in central Bitola.\n\nThe hotel is housed in a historic building which has been painstakingly restored. Some of the fancier suites and rooms are themed around figures from Bitola’s past, including Atatürk.\n\nNote: Due to the historic nature of the building, there are no elevators in the hotel. Be prepared to tackle a few flights of stairs. Rooms from £66 a night.\n\n7 of our favourite things to do on Širok Sokak\n\nWhen you’ve had your fill of strolling up and down, there are plenty of attractions to visit on and around Širok Sokak. From statues to museums, here are seven of our favourite things to do whilst exploring Bitola’s main street.\n\n1) Visit the Manaki Cinema on Širok Sokak\n\nYanaki and Milton Manaki are two of Bitola’s most celebrated sons. During the early twentieth century, the Manaki brothers pioneered the adoption of motion pictures across the Balkans, with much of their work centred around the city.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Manaki brothers founded an outdoor cinema in Bitola. Before long, an indoor cinema was built, which ran for several years until it was gutted by a fire in 1939.\n\nToday, the Manaki Cinema has been restored and stands as a symbol of Bitola’s cinematic legacy. When we visited, the cinema was still very much active. On one particular evening, a throng of smartly dressed locals queued up for entry to a screening.\n\nThe cinema also hosts the annual Manaki Brothers Film Festival, which celebrates cinematography across the Balkans and beyond.\n\n2) Admire Bitola’s Clock Tower\n\nThe magnificent Clock Tower is a symbol of Bitola. At 33 meters tall, the square-based tower looms over a small patch of neatly mown grass and shaped hedges and is a popular spot for photographs and selfies.\n\nInterestingly, there is no consensus as to the tower’s age. An information plaque outside explains that the general assumption is the tower was constructed around 1830.\n\nVisitors often combine a trip to the Clock Tower with a visit to the Yeni Mosque and the statue of Philip II of Macedon. This informal cultural triangle stands at the northern tip of Širok Sokak and is popular at all times of day and night.\n\nOur favourite time to visit is early morning, when golden sunlight illuminates the intricate clock face at the top of the tower.\n\nA bonus extra: If you are so inclined, don’t forget to check out the “I love Bitola” sign right next to the tower.\n\n3) Gaze at the Philip II of Macedon statue\n\nAtop a galloping horse, a weather-worn figure stretches an arm towards the sky. Surrounding the 8.5-metre statue, a rusting fountain forms the shape of a shield, demonstrating the figure’s warrior credentials.\n\nThe man atop the horse is King Philip of Macedon, who founded the nearby city of Heraclea. The monument celebrates Philip’s role in the development of ancient Macedonia and his legacy in modern-day Bitola.\n\nIt’s an unmissable landmark in Bitola, if only because you cannot avoid it when walking around. The statue marks the northern edge of Širok Sokak and is worth a brief stop on any trip to the city.\n\n4) Admire the architecture of the Ottoman-era Yeni Mosque\n\nNext to King Philip’s monument is the Yeni Mosque, which translates to New Mosque.\n\nDating back to the mid-sixteenth century, the mosque has a history which belies its ‘new’ title. Historians believe the mosque was built atop the remains of an ancient church, and constructed in a manner that reflected the preferred style of the Ottomans during the 1500s.\n\nNote: As of 2023, the mosque is currently under renovation and can only be viewed from the outside.\n\n5) Grab a coffee from one of the many cafes on Širok Sokak\n\nThe best thing to do on Širok Sokak is to grab a coffee and watch the world go by. The cafes are particularly busy in the evenings, when thousands descend on the street to socialise and unwind.\n\nCatch-ups with friends, dates, family meet-ups – everything happens over a coffee on Širok Sokak. Pick a table, place your order and join the crowds.\n\nRead next: 20 brilliant things to do in Skopje.\n\n6) Admire the House of the Army\n\nThe House of Officers – or House of the Army – is one of the best-preserved reminders of Bitola’s history as an Ottoman outpost. For nearly a century, the city was home to one of the Ottoman Empire’s most prominent military schools.\n\nConstructed in 1909, the building was designed to be a blend of fortress and palace – simultaneously evoking both military power and upper-class grandeur.\n\nDuring its heyday, the House of the Army was home to military officers. For decades, it hosted visiting dignitaries, evening receptions and parties.\n\nEventually, in the 1990s, the building was decommissioned. Today, the House of the Army has been repurposed and is now used as a cultural centre for Bitola, hosting dozens of intimate concerts and events each year.\n\nWhere to find it: The House of the Army stands towards the southern end of Širok Sokak.\n\n7) Explore Bitola’s city museum\n\nFor a deeper dive into the history of Bitola, head to the city’s museum, which is housed in one of the old buildings of the Ottoman military school.\n\nWhen we visited, it was one hour before closing. We had the entire museum to ourselves. It’s surprisingly large, with cavernous rooms packed full of archaeological finds and artefacts from Bitola and the surrounding region.\n\nUnbeknown to us when we entered, the museum is also home to a permanent exhibition about the life of Atatürk, the father of the modern Turkish nation. Atatürk studied at the military school in Bitola, and the museum is a popular stop for Turkish tourists, many of whom leave heartfelt messages in the leatherbound visitor book.\n\nHow to visit: The museum is open from 8am to 8pm between April and October. Outside of those months, the museum shuts at 6pm. There is a small entry fee, payable in cash.\n\nRead next: The best things to do in Prilep, just a short journey from Bitola.\n\nSome final hints and tips from our experiences of Širok Sokak\n\nThe information listed above should be enough to ensure a great time when you explore the length of Bitola’s main street.\n\nBelow are some final hints and tips based on our experience on Širok Sokak.\n\nMost ATMs are on the upper half of the street – and most locals use one specific ATM\n\nMost restaurants and cafés on Širok Sokak only take cash. There are several ATMs on the top half of Širok Sokak, but none towards the bottom end of the street.\n\nWe noticed that the Stopanska Bank ATM was popular among the locals, with small queues forming. We’re unsure why this is, but we followed suit and had no issues. You can find the Stopanksa Bank ATM here.\n\nRead next: Returning to Skopje, North Macedonia’s capital.\n\nThere are plenty of stray dogs – but don’t worry too much\n\nLike the rest of North Macedonia, Bitola city centre is home to many stray dogs. Unsurprisingly, you can find many of them on Širok Sokak.\n\nThe dogs are generally pretty chilled out, although they will often approach people dining on the street and wait next to the table in search of food.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the dogs are at their most energetic at the start and end of the day. I went for a sunrise walk and found a large pack of dogs running down Širok Sokak. They paid no attention to me, but it could be a little disconcerting if you are alone or have a slight phobia.\n\nOur final tip – spend some time walking around without a plan\n\nWhilst there are plenty of things to see and do on Širok Sokak, we think the best way to experience Bitola’s main street is by just…walking.\n\nFor an hour or two, try not to make any plans. Head to Širok Sokak and just walk around, soaking in the atmosphere, maybe stopping for a coffee or some cake. See what you feel like in the moment, and we’re sure you will have a brilliant time."
