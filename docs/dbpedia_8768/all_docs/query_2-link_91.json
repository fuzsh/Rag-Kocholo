        "text": "‚ÄúMacedonia üá≤üá∞ ~Magnolia Square in Bitola‚Äù\n\nWe are back in Macedonia!\n\nWhen we were here the first time, last month, we were only here long enough to visit the capital; Skopje and rent the car, before heading for Kosovo.\n\nAfter spending over a month on our Balkan Road Trip, already, and loving it, we are feeling very filled-up in all things Balkan. Keep in mind, many of the, now, individual Balkan Peninsula countries, use to be one large country called Yugoslavia. For this reason, there are some similarities.\n\nThe Balkan Peninsula consists of the following countries:\n\nAlbania, Croatia, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, continental Greece, and the European part of Turkey\n\nOnce we go to Bulgaria, which is our next stop (God willing), I will have completed my goal of visiting every country in the Balkans. My first stop in Eastern Europe was several years ago, to Romania. I loved it, and decided one day I would see the rest of the countries in the Balkans\n\nAbout Former Yugoslavia\n\nYugoslavia literally means ‚ÄúSlavs of the South‚Äù\n\nYugoslavia was a country made up of several ethnicities, causing conflict in the country.\n\nWhen most former nations have already seceded, the civil war broke out in Yugoslavia in April 1992, when the Croats voted to follow suit.\n\nToday, there are six independent countries that were once part of the Kraljevina Jugoslavija (The Yugoslavian Kingdom); they are Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro. Kosovo is a state that broke off of Serbia with partial recognition as an independent nation. (it is recognised by 111 UN countries, including global powers like the US, Canada and Japan, but is not recognized by Serbia and others.\n\nBitola is the second largest city in Macedonia with a history dating back to the middle of the 4th century BC, back then it was known to the ancient world as Heraclea Lyncestis; a city founded by Phillip II of Macedon (the father of Alexander the Great). For this, Bitola is the oldest city in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nGo To Home Page"
