        "text": "Bitola - Jahdar Kadi Mosque by builder Sinan\n\nBitola is a city in the south western part of the Republic of Macedonia. It is located in the southern part of the Pelagonia valley, surrounded by the Baba, Nidže and Kajmakčalan mountain ranges, 14 kilometres (9 miles) north of the Medžitlija-Níki border crossing with Greece. Bitola is one of the oldest cities on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, having been founded as Heraclea Lyncestis in the middle of the 4th century BC by Philip II of Macedon. The city was the last capital of Ottoman Rumelia, from 1836–1867. It has been known since the Ottoman period as \"the city of the consuls\", since many European countries had consulates in Bitola.\n\nSouth of today's city was the ancient Heracleia Lyncestis, significant parts of which have been excavated in recent decades. In Roman times, Heracleia was an important stop on the Via Egnatia and a suburb of the Lyncestis countryside. The city was already the seat of a bishop in the 4th and 5th centuries, and its metropolitans are attested as participants in the ecumenical councils. As a result of the Slavic conquest from the 7th century, the region was plundered several times.\n\nThe city centre is characterized by historical buildings from the Ottoman era. In addition to the many mosques, Bitola has a number of Orthodox churches as well as the Catholic Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. The Covered Market (Besistan), Isak Mosque, White Mosque, Jeni Mosque and Jahdar Kadi Mosque remain from the Ottoman era. These structures were built in the 16th century. The Jahdar Kadi Mosque was built by Sinan, the most famous Ottoman architect of the era."
