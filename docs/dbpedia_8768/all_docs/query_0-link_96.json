        "text": "At the turn of the 20th century, the situation in Ottoman Macedonia was immensely complicated. Being aware of the reality that soon the Empire might dissolve the neighboring Balkan countries will start to show their appetites towards the remaining parts of the Empire in the Balkans - mainly the territory of Ottoman Macedonia. The Balkan countries will do their best to gain an advantage of the fact that the Empire allowed the religious institutions to take care of their flock's religious and communal affairs. This situation will give a chance to the Balkan countries to spread their propaganda through these religious and educational institutions, aiming to win over the Macedonian population. Due to their (propaganda) activities, the formerly Muslim-Christian division will be “enriched” with new “millets” which regardless of their ethnolinguistic similarities were often hostile to each other. This situation was a great challenge to Macedonian Revolutionary Organization founded in 1893, having a goal to gain autonomy/independence for Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire. Aware of the fact the division and hostility between the different millets in Ottoman Macedonia is a significant obstacle in achieving their goal, members of MRO will try not only to ease the animosity between the various Christian millets but also if possible, to work together and get along with the Muslim population in Ottoman Macedonia. In this paper, an attempt will be made to show the activities of the members of the Organization in this regard and to compare their approach to the Macedonian population with the one made by the institutions of the Balkan countries in Ottoman Macedonia"
