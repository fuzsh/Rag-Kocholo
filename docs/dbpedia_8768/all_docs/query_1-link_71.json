        "text": "History\n\nThe sanjak was established by 1415â17.[2] After 1431, the capital of the sanjak seems to have been VlorÃ«.\n\nIn the 1431â32 period all rural and urban households and their property were registered in all ten districts of the Arvanid sanjak.[4] The 1432 register shows that districts in the Sanjak of Albania were further divided on 335 timars, each composed by two or three villages. The Arvanid register is one of the earliest available land registers in Ottoman Empire's archives,[5][6] and was published in 1954.\n\nIn 1432 Andrew Thopia and Gjergj Arianiti revolted against the empire.[8] When the Albanian Revolt of 1432â36 began the sanjakbey of Albania was Ali Bey Evrenosoglu.[9] The uprising was finally suppressed during the 1435â36 campaigns of Ali Bey[10] and Turakhan Beg.[11]\n\nIn 1437, when Teodor III Muzaka revolted against the Ottomans, the sanjak-bey of Albania was his son Yakup Bey.[12] In 1437â38 Skanderbeg was appointed the subaÅi of KrujÃ«, after which Hizir Bey was again appointed to that position in November 1438. The first position of Hadim Sehabeddin Pasha outside the sultan's palace was the position of sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Albania, which he held until 1439 when he was appointed as beylerbey of the Rumelia Eyalet.[15] When in 1441 PÃ«rmet was annexed to the sanjak of Albania, Yakup Bey is mentioned as its sanjakbey.[16] He remained on the position of the sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Albania until September 1442[17] when he was killed as one of 16 Ottoman sanjakbeys under command of Hadim Sehabeddin Pasha who were all killed by Christian forces commanded by Janos Hunyadi in a battle near IalomiÈa River.[18]\n\nHadim Suleiman Pasha was the sanjak-bey of Albania briefly before becoming the sanjak-bey of Smederevo.[19]"
