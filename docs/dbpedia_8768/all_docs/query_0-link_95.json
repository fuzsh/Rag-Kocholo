        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nVeliko Tarnovo (Bulgarian: Велико Търново; \"Great Tarnovo\") Bulgarian pronunciation: [vɛˈliko ˈtɤ̞rnovo] is a city in north central Bulgaria and the administrative centre of Veliko Tarnovo Province.\n\nOften referred to as the \"City of the Tsars\", Veliko Tarnovo is located on the Yantra River and is famous as the historical capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, attracting many tourists with its unique architecture. The old part of the city is situated on the three hills Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. On Tsarevets are the palaces of the Bulgarian emperors and the Patriarchate, the Patriarchal Cathedral, as well as a number of administrative and residential edifices surrounded by thick walls. Trapezitsa is known for its many churches and as the former main residence of the nobility. In the Middle Ages, the city was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School and literature. Veliko Tarnovo is an important administrative, economic, educational, and cultural centre of Northern Bulgaria.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe most widespread theory for the name's origin claims, that the original names Tarnovgrad and Tarnovo come from the Old Bulgarian тръневъ (tranev) or тръновъ (tranov), meaning \"thorny\". The suffix \"grad\" means \"city\" in Bulgarian and in many Slavic languages. In 1965, in addition to the original name was added the word велико (veliko), meaning \"great\", in honour of the city as an old capital of Bulgaria. This also helps distinguish it from the town of Malko Tarnovo. Other origin may be from Vlach/Romanian word \"Turnu\", meaning tower. From Turnu derived Tarnovo.\n\nClimate[]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo has a Temperate climate: cold snowy winters and hot summers. The average minimum temperature in the coldest month - January is about−3 °C (27 °F), while the average maximum in August, the hottest months is 31 °C (88 °F). The highest recorded temperature is 43.1 °C (110 °F), while the lowest - −28.1 °C (−19 °F), though according to unofficial data the temperature had dropped to −38 °C (−36 °F).\n\nClimate data for Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria (2000-) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °C (°F) 6.1\n\n(43.0) 8.1\n\n(46.6) 13.5\n\n(56.3) 19.6\n\n(67.3) 24.8\n\n(76.6) 28.2\n\n(82.8) 30.9\n\n(87.6) 31.2\n\n(88.2) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 19.8\n\n(67.6) 14.0\n\n(57.2) 7.8\n\n(46.0) 19.1\n\n(66.4) Daily mean °C (°F) 1.1\n\n(34.0) 2.7\n\n(36.9) 7.7\n\n(45.9) 13.0\n\n(55.4) 18.3\n\n(64.9) 21.8\n\n(71.2) 24.1\n\n(75.4) 24.1\n\n(75.4) 19.0\n\n(66.2) 13.6\n\n(56.5) 8.6\n\n(47.5) 3.1\n\n(37.6) 13.2\n\n(55.8) Average low °C (°F) −3.4\n\n(25.9) −2.7\n\n(27.1) 2.1\n\n(35.8) 6.6\n\n(43.9) 11.7\n\n(53.1) 15.6\n\n(60.1) 17.2\n\n(63.0) 17.0\n\n(62.6) 12.8\n\n(55.0) 7.6\n\n(45.7) 3.3\n\n(37.9) −1.4\n\n(29.5) 7.3\n\n(45.1) Precipitation mm (inches) 48\n\n(1.89) 44\n\n(1.73) 43\n\n(1.69) 63\n\n(2.48) 88\n\n(3.46) 86\n\n(3.39) 65\n\n(2.56) 56\n\n(2.2) 41\n\n(1.61) 45\n\n(1.77) 51\n\n(2.01) 50\n\n(1.97) 680\n\n(26.77) Source: Stringmeteo.com[2]\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrehistory and antiquity[]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, with a history of more than five millennia. The first traces of human presence, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, were discovered on Trapezitsa Hill.[3]\n\nMedieval Bulgarian rule[]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo, originally Tarnovgrad (Търновград), grew quickly to become the strongest Bulgarian fortification of the Middle Ages between the 12th and 14th century and the most important political, economic, cultural and religious centre of the empire. The city was described by Bulgarian cleric Gregory Tsamblak in the 14th century as \"a very large city, handsome and surrounded by walls with 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants\".[4]\n\nIn the 14th century as the Byzantine Empire weakened, Tarnovo claimed to be the Third Rome based on its preeminent cultural influence in Eastern Europe.\n\nAs the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Tarnovo was a quasi-cosmopolitan city, with many foreign merchants and envoys. It is known that Tarnovo had Armenian, Jewish and Roman Catholic (\"Frankish\") merchant quarters besides a dominant Bulgarian population. The discovery of three Gothic statuette heads indicates there may have also been a Catholic church.[5]\n\nOttoman rule[]\n\nТhe political upsurge and spiritual development of Tarnovo were discontinued when the Ottoman Empire captured the city on 17 July 1393. The siege lasted for three months, with defences being led by Bulgarian Patriarch Evtimiy himself.[6] Three years later, the Ottomans had conquered the entire Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBulgarian resistance against Ottoman rule remained centred in Tarnovo (then known as Tırnova) until the end of the 17th century. Two major uprisings anti-Ottoman - in 1598 and in 1686 - started in the city. Tarnovo was consecutively a district (sanjak) capital within the Rumelia Eyalet, within the Silistria Eyalet, and finally in the Danube Vilayet.\n\nTarnovgrad, along with the rest of present-day Bulgaria, remained under Ottoman rule until the 19th century, when national identity and culture reasserted themselves as a strengthening resistance movement. The idea of the establishment of an independent Bulgarian church and nation motivated the 1875 and 1876 uprisings in the town. On 23 April 1876, the April Uprising marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman occupation. It was soon followed by the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).\n\nThird Bulgarian State[]\n\nOn 7 July 1877, Russian general Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko liberated Veliko Tarnovo, ending the 480-year-rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin created a Principality of Bulgaria between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Tarnovo.\n\nOn 17 April 1879, the first National Assembly convened in Veliko Turnovo to ratify the state's first constitution, known as the Tarnovo Constitution, the key result of which resulted in the transfer of Parliament from Tarnovgrad to Sofia, which today remains the Bulgarian capital.\n\nIn deference to the city's past, Tsar Ferdinand Saxe-Coburg Gotha chose the St Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo as the place to declare the complete independence of Bulgaria on 5 October 1908.\n\nIn 1965, the city, then officially known as Tarnovo, was renamed to Veliko Tarnovo (Great Tarnovo) to commemorate its rich history and importance.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo today[]\n\nToday the town is undergoing extensive construction, including reconstruction of the old city and some of the buildings on historical streets. The two universities, the American University and Agriculture University give the town a youthful and educated feel. The city also hosts many culture activities such as music from Bulgarian and foreign singers, theater, and festivals. Today the town is also one of Bulgaria's biggest manufacturers of sweets.\n\nPopulation[]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Veliko Tarnovo has a population of 68,783 inhabitants, as of February 2011, while the Veliko Tarnovo Municipality with the villages, has 88,670.[1] The number of the residents of the city reached its peak in the period 1986–1991 when it exceeded 70,000.[7] The following table presents the change of the population after 1887.\n\nVeliko Tarnovo Year 1887 1910 1934 1946 1956 1965 1975 1985 1992 2001 2005 2009 2011 Population 11,314 12,469 13,963 16,223 24,648 37,337 56,664 69,173 77,644 72,897 69,145 67,099 66,783 Highest number 80,783 in 1990 Sources: National Statistical Institute,[1][7][8] „citypopulation.de“,[9] „pop-stat.mashke.org“,[10] Bulgarian Academy of Sciences[11]\n\nEthnic, linguistic and religious composition[]\n\nAccording to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:[12][13]\n\nBulgarians: 59,649 (95.5%)\n\nTurks: 2,225 (3.6%)\n\nGypsies: 123 (0.2%)\n\nOthers: 258 (0.4%)\n\nIndefinable: 198 (0.3%)\n\nRomanians: 100\n\nUndeclared: 6,330 (9.2%)\n\nTotal: 100,783\n\nNeighborhoods[]\n\n\"Buzludja\" (Bulgarian\"Бузлуджа\") - 19 500 people\n\n\"Kolio Ficheto\"(\"Triagalnika\")(on Bulgarian \"Кольо Фичето\"(\"Триъгълника\")) - 17 000 people\n\n\"Shirok centar\" (Bulgarian\"Широк център\") - 10 000 people\n\n\"Center\" (Bulgarian\"Център\") - 8 000 people\n\n\"Zona B\" (Bulgarian\"Зона Б\") - 8 000 people\n\n\"Kartala\" (Bulgarian\"Картала\") - 4 800 people\n\n\"Akacia\" (Bulgarian\"Акация\") - 3 200 people\n\n\"Cholakovci\" (Bulgarian\"Чолаковци\") - 4 200 people\n\n\"Sveta gora\" (Bulgarian\"Света гора\") - 3 140 people\n\n\"Varusha North\" (Bulgarian\"Варуша Север\") - 900 people\n\n\"Varusha South\" (Bulgarian\"Варуша Юг\") - 300 people\n\n\"Asenov\" (Bulgarian\"Асенов\") - 800 people\n\n\"Zona A\" (Bulgarian\"Зона А\") - 200 people(also ville zone)\n\n\"Slanchev dom\" (Bulgarian\"Слънчев дом\") - 80 people\n\n\"Veliko Tarnovo hills\" - in building\n\nville zone \"Derven\" (Bulgarian\"Дервен\") - 80 people\n\nThe ethnic composition of Veliko Tarnovo Municipality is 100570 Bulgarians, 3681 Turks and 595 Gypsies among others.\n\nEducation[]\n\nHigher education[]\n\nVeliko Tarnovo has two universities.
