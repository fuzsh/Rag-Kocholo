        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n Reviews New Directions in German Cinema. Ed. by P C and C H. London and New York: IB Tauris. . xii+ pp. £.; $.. ISBN ––––. In his seminal essay ‘From New German Cinema to the Post-Wall Cinema of Consensus ’, Eric Rentschler charts the rise of a new generation of German ﬁlm-makers who rejected the auteurist approaches of Fassbinder and his contemporaries, and looked instead to popular cinema and, above all, to Hollywood for their inspiration (in Cinema and Nation, ed. by Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie (London: Routledge, ), pp. –). Building on Rentschler’s analysis of the state of German cinema from the perspective of the year , New Directions in German Cinema traces the next decade of ﬁlm production in the Federal Republic and considers the ways in which recent German ﬁlms have engaged not only with the consensualist agendas of the s comedies, but also with the more introspective, socially critical legacy of the New German Cinema. e editors Paul Cooke and Chris Homewood have produced a volume of essays that focus on landmark productions released between  and . In the course of their thought-provoking introduction, the reader is reminded of the sheer diversity of ﬁlm output in Germany during the past decade and—in the context of an increasingly globalized industry—how problematic the notion of a German national cinema has become. As the editors point out, the comedies of the s have been superseded by a much more critical engagement with discourses of national identity in the Federal Republic. For while the legacy of DEFA and East German ﬁlm culture prior to  provides a lens through which to view the problematic impact of reuniﬁcation, the transnational turn in German cinema—as exempliﬁed, above all, in the ﬁlms of Fatih Akin—has brought the situation of the Turkish diaspora in the Federal Republic ever more sharply into focus. Likewise, questions of German-Jewish identity, German–Polish relations, and the current valency of ‘Heimat’—that most loaded of concepts—have been critically probed in ﬁlms by Dani Levy (Alles auf Zucker!, ), Hans-Christian Schmid (Lichter, ), and Edgar Reitz (Heimat , ). As Cooke and Homewood argue, the renewed emphasis on the complexity of socio-political structures in the Berlin republic has been accompanied by a revival of interest in formal experimentation. In the case of directors such as Oskar Roehler, Fatih Akin, and Christian Petzold, they discern an attempt to follow in the footsteps of Fassbinder and to ‘create aesthetically challenging cinema that can also indulge audiences’ desires for popular genres’ (p. ). Likewise, the slow-paced reﬂective aesthetic so prominent in some of the productions of the so-called ‘Berliner Schule’ has, as they point out, been hailed in some quarters as a ‘Nouvelle Vague Allemande’ for the next millennium. In the ﬁnal part of their introduction the editors turn their attention to the genre of the heritage ﬁlm and the emotional power of mainstream cinema—Dennis Gansel’s NaPolA — Elite für den Führer () and Oliver Hirschbiegel’s Der Untergang () are perhaps the most obvious examples—to produce identiﬁcatory narratives that some have condemned MLR, .,   as deeply reactionary. Nevertheless, as they argue, to dismiss such productions out of hand is to ignore the ways in which, as Alison Landsberg has argued, such ﬁlms allow the spectator to ‘inhabit other people’s memories as other people’s memories [. . .] thereby respecting and recognising diﬀerence’ (Prosthetic Memory: e Transformation of American Remembrance in the Age of Mass Culture (New York: Columbia University Press, ), p. ). Indeed, one of the great strengths of Cooke and Homewood’s introduction is the way in which they demonstrate that the relationship between mainstream cinema and the prevailing discourses of memory in the Federal Republic is much more complex than many commentators have been willing to acknowledge. With the sole exception of John Davidson’s chapter on Alexander Kluge’s avantgarde ‘Minutenﬁlme’, the chapters in the volume are devoted to studies of some of the best-known ﬁlms to have emerged from Germany in the last decade, including Sophie Scholl — die letzten Tage (), Das Leben der Anderen (), Der Baader Meinhof Komplex (), Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei (), Yella (), Wolke  (), Gegen die Wand (), and Heimat  (). e..."
