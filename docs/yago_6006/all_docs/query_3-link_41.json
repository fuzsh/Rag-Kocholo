        "text": "In an attempt to highlight Jewish-Arab cooperation in medieval Spain, and to put a spotlight on marginalized Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewish cultures, the Festival traveled to Madrid in 1992 for the 500th anniversary of the Inquisition and Jewish expulsion. There, the Festival reached sold-out audiences, mostly students in their 20s and 30s, who participated in electrifying discussions about the meaning of multiculturalism, even as a new European multi-ethnic war raged in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSFJFF also broadened its reach in its early years through a national distribution arm, Atara Releasing, and with the production of the first-ever catalog of Jewish cinema. In addition, SFJFF established a partnership with local PBS affiliate KQED, first with the weekly series called the Living Room Festival followed by an annual broadcast of films from the Festival in the \"Best of the SFJFF\" each fall.\n\nIn the fall of 1993, founding director Deborah Kaufman left the SFJFF after 13 years to produce documentary films. Janis Plotkin was appointed Executive Artistic Director and Caroline Libresco was hired as Associate Director. Libresco served the Festival for three years by co-programming and producing the Festival and running Atara Releasing, which shuttered in 2001. After which she moved on to a senior programmer role at the Sundance Film Festival. In late 2019 she returned to the Jewish Film Institute as the Womens Fund Programmer and continues to produce films.\n\nUnder Plotkin's leadership, SFJFF expanded the summer Festival to include screenings in the burgeoning high-tech South Bay in 1996 and to the north in Marin County in 1997. New audiences clearly had a hunger for the kind of meaty, real, food-for-thought cinema that the Festival was offering. During Plotkin's tenure, the audience reached 34,000. In 1999 the Festival launched year-round programming with monthly screenings at San Francisco's downtown multi-cultural arts center, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, providing an opportunity for Bay Area audiences to see films on Jewish subjects year-round.The arrival of the Internet in the 1990's revolutionized communication with Festival audiences, other film programmers, and anyone interested in researching Jewish film. Under the guidance of Eviatar Shafrir and Peter Jacobson, the SFJFF launched a robust website and developed a dynamic virtual version of its film catalog, still a popular and much-accessed resource on the Jewish Film Institute's website.\n\nIn an attempt to highlight Jewish-Arab cooperation in medieval Spain, and to put a spotlight on marginalized Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewish cultures, the Festival traveled to Madrid in 1992 for the 500th anniversary of the Inquisition and Jewish expulsion. There, the Festival reached sold-out audiences, mostly students in their 20s and 30s, who participated in electrifying discussions about the meaning of multiculturalism, even as a new European multi-ethnic war raged in the former Yugoslavia. (Left: SFJFF in Madrid, 1992)\n\nWhen Peter Stein stepped down in 2011, educator and award-winning independent filmmaker Lexi Leban took over as the new Executive Director. A longtime member of the Bay Area film community, Leban worked in all aspects of film, from production to distribution to exhibition. In addition to her knowledge and commitment to high-quality programming and issues of importance to a diverse community, Leban brought hands-on experience as a filmmaker and a breadth of experience as an educator working with young filmmakers and new media. The former Academic Director of the Digital Filmmaking & Video Production at the Art Institute of California and creator of their Bachelor's degree program, Leban placed a new emphasis on providing artists services and support for both emerging and established filmmakers.\n\nUnder Leban's leadership, SFJFF awarded its first filmmaker residency in 2012. The Filmmaker Residency program provides filmmakers with a private office and access to the screening room in the Ninth Street Independent Film Center; promotional support through social media and online publications; and a Meet & Greet with Bay Area's film industry professionals.\n\nIn 2013, SFJFF partnered with the independent-movie distribution company Film Movement to create the SFJFF Film Movement Award to honor the best achievement in short films focusing on Jewish themes. The award also includes an option for a non-exclusive distribution deal with Film Movement and release on DVD.\n\nAfter more than three decades as the leading curatorial voice for Jewish film and media, Leban, the Board and staff of SFJFF decided it was time for a new name that better reflected the evolution of the organization and the services they were providing to filmmakers and audiences in the Bay Area and beyond.\n\nIn 2015, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival became the Jewish Film Institute (JFI). JFI would still present the annual San Francisco Jewish Film Festival - which would retain the original name - but the organization now had a name that encompassed the entirety of their efforts and better reflected their status as a global leader in the field of media arts.Seeking to grow both its national and international audience base, Leban continued to expand JFI's online presence with the launch of JFI On Demand which debuted, along with the new Jewish Film Institute website, in the summer of 2015.\n\nIn 2017, the Jewish Film Institute refreshed its JFI On Demand initiative, offering a greater value to both educators and casual film watchers by aggregating results from different streaming platforms on its archive film pages. Web visitors can now search for films on JFI On Demand and select which platform of their choice to watch the film.\n\nWe hope you will join us as we write the next chapter of our history.\n\n[SFJFF gratefully acknowledges Deborah Kaufman and Janis Plotkin for their contributions to writing this history.]"
