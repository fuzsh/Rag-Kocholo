        "text": "A Pacific Northwest native, Dani Levy grew up surrounded by some of the most spectacular scenery in the United States. This upbringing instilled in her a passion for the outdoors and a duty to protect the natural resources that make continued use of public lands possible. Dani brings with her a background in investigative reporting and policy research, with prior work focusing on corporate wrongdoing and law. She’s worked in broadcast media to identify loopholes in policy that enable harmful business practices, from child marriages to Medicaid policy. Her most recent project, CBS’s Whistleblower, helped expose the biggest biodiesel fraud in U.S. history, wherein the government alleges executives bought and resold hundreds of gallons of impure biofuel to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of fraudulently-obtained tax credits. Working with Friends of the Chicago River, she helped create a call-to-action film by profiling a group of river-rowing breast cancer survivors who face health threats from its toxic waters. Other work involves investigating pollution from military firefighting and local government mismanagement of asbestos-infested buildings. Dani holds a degree in journalism and political science and a certificate in entrepreneurship from Northwestern University, where she studied environmental policy and led educational video initiatives for student-run organizations. She’s scuba-dove throughout Indonesian islands, hiked the Swiss Alps, surfed Costa Rican waters and hopes to continue her adventures along the coast of Maine as CMG's Program Director."
