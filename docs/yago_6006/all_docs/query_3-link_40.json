What price to sell or buy? Theatrical or straight to streaming? These are key questions that we can help answer in seconds. In our latest insights (link below), we take a deep dive into the streaming performance of some Sundance 2023 titles and forecast the domestic and international estimates for some highly anticipated 2024 titles, including #FreakyTales. LINK: https://lnkd.in/gXw8uXBZ Get in touch to discuss our findings and how Cinelytic can keep you ahead of the game at any market\n\nMy Topic: \"The Rise of Day-and-Date Releases: Changing How We Watch Movies üìΩÔ∏èüçø\" \"üé¨ Film distribution is evolving rapidly, and one exciting trend is the 'Day-and-Date' release strategy. In this new era, movies hit theaters and streaming platforms on the same day. What do you think about this approach? Is it a game-changer for the film industry, or do you prefer the traditional cinema experience? Share your thoughts! ü§î #FilmDistribution #DayAndDate #MovieTrends\"\n\nThe upcoming release of the blockbuster film Twisters (centred around a social-media celebrity storm-chaser) ‚Äì a sequel to 1996‚Äôs Twister ¬≠‚Äì demonstrates an ongoing public fascination in hazards and, more specifically, footage of extreme weather. The arrival of camera and streaming technologies have made it easier to collect and share such footage in recent years, resulting in often dramatic footage being live-streamed on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Discord. Now, a new study conducted at the University has for the first time analysed what might be motivating people to watch these streams ‚Äì in some instances for up to 12 hours at a time. https://lnkd.in/eqWVZn34\n\nDespite concerns about the film industry's decline due to OTT platforms and COVID-related disruptions, recent box office successes have shown a strong comeback. As a cinema lover I am happy at this revival. As an investor, I sit up and take notice of possible opportunities in this space! The unique cinematic experience of theaters, especially for blockbusters, remains unmatched. I think in times of gloom, we ignore the distinctiveness of the experience between theaters and OTT platforms. Blockbusters like \"Avatar\" or recent Tom Cruise films are designed for the big screen. The industry is adapting to survive and thrive, and it's clear that both big screens and OTT can coexist and cater to different audience preferences. Mark Twain's quote seems apt for the movie making business ‚Äì the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated!\n\nA recent market research campaign in the US has pinpointed the 'perfect' movie runtime: 92 minutes. Conducted by Talker Research with 2,000 Americans, the poll revealed a preference for shorter films, with just 15% agreeing that movies should exceed 2 hours. Surprisingly, the study identified five films as the 'perfect' length, all clocking in at 92 minutes. Despite this, modern movies are trending longer, aiming to make cinema outings feel like special events and offer value for money. The rise of streaming services has influenced cinematic runtimes, with theaters marketing longer films as immersive experiences. While the ideal runtime may be 92 minutes, the allure of epic storytelling and maximizing value for viewers continues to shape the film industry. üé•‚ú® #MovieRuntime #CinemaExperience Source: #MovieWeb\n\nWith \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" hitting streaming platforms this month, it's the perfect time to revisit an incredible opportunity I had to discuss the film. \"Be For Reel,\" a collaborative series by Golden Screen Cinemas and Disney, hosted by \"Goggler,\" dives into the nitty-gritty of latest films! üé¨ü§ò In the first episode of \"Be For Reel,\" we explored how this film measures up against its predecessors, delved into character arcs, analyzed pivotal plot moments, and speculated on the future direction of this iconic franchise ü¶ß Check out the full video by clicking the link below! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Link: https://lnkd.in/gshABpCN\n\nNielsen, a U.S.-based data and analytics firm that tracks tv and streaming viewing habits, has released its lists of the most-streamed films and series of 2023. Animated films that previously received theatrical releases dominated the 2023 film list, taking the top seven spots, with several years-old titles still holding an impressive grip on audiences. Nielsen‚Äôs chart seems to suggest that films which spend time in cinemas benefit from that exposure, sometimes for years after the release has finished its theatrical run. https://lnkd.in/dFxRGcHj"
