Towns and people, routes that meet or are lost forever…\n\nFilm screenings programme:\n\nFriday 5th August 2016 at 20:30\n\nGo for sugar (Alles auf Zucker) (2004)\n\nUsing ruthless humour, wittiness and irony, the film tells the story of a Jewish family that was separated by the erection of the Berlin Wall and has remained, since then, divided and in quarrel. The family meets again in today’s Berlin for the funeral of the mother. A unique comedy with references to Berlin, through shots of well-known areas of the city.\n\n*In German with English and Greek subtitles, 95’\n\nDirected by Dani Levy\n\nMusic: Niki Reiser\n\nWednesday 10th August 2016 at 20:30\n\nTo Rome with Love (2012)\n\nFour stories unfold in the eternal city. Woody Allen, Penelope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin and Roberto Benigni, strangers in the same city, live and fall in love with the familiar way of the director, and guide us to the monuments and the neighbourhoods of Rome with the necessary accompaniment of Italian music and songs. A charming film, a sample of Woody Allen’s love for Italy and Rome.\n\n*In English with Greek subtitles, 111’\n\nFriday 12th August 2016 at 20:30\n\nPlato’s Academy (2009)\n\nA different view of the Greek neighbourhood. Stavros and his friends, typical lazy Greek men, lay back all day in front of Stavros’ kiosk. Everything changes, though, when one morning Stavros’ mother recognises an Albanian man as her missing son.\n\n*In Greek with English surtitles, 103’\n\nDirected by Filippos Tsitos\n\nCast: Antonis Kafetzopoulos, Anastasis Kozdine, Maria Zorba, Yiorgos Souxes\n\nFriday 19th August 2016 at 20:30\n\nCome Back (Volver) (2006)\n\nA film with Madrid as a background, where three generations of women coexist with madness, lies and superstition for death, that give a special structure in their daily lives. Raimunda lives in Madrid with her daughter Paula and her husband Paco, who is always drunk. Her sister Sole is divorced and secretly working as a hairdresser. A tragic event from their childhood marks their everyday life and, when their aunt dies, the past returns to haunt them.\n\n*In Spanish with Greek and English subtitles, 121’\n\nCast: Carmen Maura, Penelope Cruz, Candela Pena, Yohana Cobo, Chus Lampreave, Antonio de la Torre, Carlos Blanco\n\nWednesday 24th August 2016 at 20:30\n\nParis, I love you (Paris, je t’ aime) (2006)\n\nThe Eiffel Tower and the Seine, the paved streets, the squares and monuments, the parks and the underground world, all the magic of Paris unfolds in 18 delightful stories of acclaimed directors from around the world (including the Coen brothers, Walter Salles, Jean-Luc Godard, Alejantro Gonzalez Inarritu, Paul Verchofen, Gus Van Sant), who give their own perspective in the subject of “love” having as their orientation the French city. An incredible mosaic of short stories all joined in a single and heady seduction full of romance, love and… the eternal City of Light.\n\n*In French with Greek subtitles, 123’\n\nCast: Juliette Binoche, Fanny Ardant, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Leonor Watling et al.\n\nLocation:\n\nSODAP Municipal Beach\n\nPafos, Cyprus\n\nFor further information telephone: +357 26 932 017\n\nWebsite: www.pafos2017.eu\n\nEntrance: Free"
