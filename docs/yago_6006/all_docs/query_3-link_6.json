        "text": "Dani Levy (born 17 November 1957) is a Swiss filmmaker, theatrical director, screenwriter and actor. Levy was born to a Jewish family in Switzerland in 1957. His mother was a Holocaust survivor. He moved to Berlin in the 1980s. Levy's films include 'RobbyKallePaul', 'I Was on Mars', 'Meschugge', 'Du mich auch' and 'Väter'. 'Väter' starred Christiane Paul.\n\nIn 2004, he directed 'Alles auf Zucker!', a comedy about a secularised Jew from the former GDR who has to reconcile himself with his Orthodox brother. In 2007, he directed the comedy-drama 'Mein Führer – Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler', about a Jewish actor hired to enliven Adolf Hitler's speeches during the final days of World War II, starring German comedian Helge Schneider.\n\nIt was entered into the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. Levy said he was influenced by the theory of Swiss-based psychologist Alice Miller, published in 1980, that something must have gone wrong with Hitler in his childhood. His 1995 film 'Stille Nacht' won an Honourable Mention at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. He is one of the founders of the German company X Filme Creative Pool.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Dani Levy, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."
