        "text": "HALF WORLD, 6 a.m.: Sirens wail. The streets empty. Windows are blacked out. People flee underground. – The sirens die down. Silence. Above the lifeless city, the sun rises and casts its deadly light over HALF WORLD.\n\n12 hours later: sunset, all-clear siren, life begins. – Good night. The film shows different survival techniques in an artificial world: action, love, sex, violence.\n\nIn the metropolises of HALF WORLD, a culture of different languages and ways of life proliferates. Katz, a dealer, roams around selling old postcards of a nature long decayed.\n\nHerzog stands on the roof of his house every morning with a stopwatch, trying to bear the sunrise. “The whites” have the monopoly on the past and produce electronic illusions with old photographs of nature for an invisible elite.\n\n“The blacks” take possession of these illusion machines and manipulate them. And in Sunny‘s day bar, this HALF WORLD meets. A mixture of science fiction and eco-thriller.\n\nFanny, a self-confident and lonely single shortly before her 30th birthday, is convinced that she is more likely to be hit by an atomic bomb than to find a man for life.\n\nIn the desolate high-rise building in which she lives, by chance Fanny meets the eccentric black bon vivant Orfeo: When they meet, he’s wearing a skeleton costume, he is homosexual and poses as a medicine man and medium. The two become friends and begin spending time together. Orfeo prophesizes that she will soon meet her prince charming.\n\nFanny promptly falls in love with Lothar, who matches the prophecies. Although he drives a sleek car, is good-looking and has charm, the romance between Fanny and him doesn’t really take off. When Fanny later learns that Orfeo is terminally ill, she realizes instead that she has found love with him, of all people, and in a completely different way than she would have imagined during her long search. She takes a course in “self-determined dying” which includes building one’s own coffin and concludes with a simulation of one’s own funeral.\n\nIn the end, instead of simply dying, Orfeo disappears in a rather magical way, Fanny looks to the future with more hope, and Orfeo’s prophecies come true once again.\n\nA man in Paris, a woman in Berlin.\n\nJulia, an art student in her late twenties, has been living together with Christian, a police detective, for several years. Their relationship has been at risk since Julia fell in love with a young bartender, Frank, who likes to unsettle her with provocative sex. Christian escapes Berlin over the holiday. He doesn’t want to live without Julia and yet he can’t stand being with her. He sets himself an eight-hour ultimatum to win her back. Alone for the first time, Julia decides to end the affair with Frank. Frank, in turn, thinks Christmas Eve would be a good time to finally confess his love to Julia. In this situation, Christian initiates a night of relationship all-time-lows with a macabre move. An erotic adventure begins.\n\nWhen German Jew Lena Katz goes to pick up her mother from a New York hotel for her birthday dinner, she finds a strange woman lying in a pool of blood in the hotel corridor. Lena accompanies this seriously injured woman to the emergency ward where she meets the latter’s son, David Fish. It is love at first sight for both of them.\n\nDavid’s mother dies as a result of her injuries that same night and Lena’s mother, although she has just arrived, hastily leaves New York without an explanation.\n\nThe dead woman in the New York hotel is a mystery: was it an accident or was she murdered? David, the dead woman’s son, sets out into the heat of New York together with a rather shady lawyer, Kaminski, to trace the case.\n\nIn the course of the investigations, Kaminski’s suspicions towards Lena’s family grow, as well as the passion of those involved, David and Lena. Fear and the turmoil of emotions, however, mean that Lena misses any opportunity to confess her origins. When she learns of the impending burden of proof against her own mother, she is faced with the most difficult decision in her life: should she protect her family whose dark secrets and entanglements she knows nothing about, or should she confide in David and the increasingly sinister Kaminski in order to solve the crime between their two families?\n\nGermany, 1943. Lilly Wust is in her late twenties, married, mother of four children. Her husband is a soldier in the war. One day, Lilly meets the self-confident Felice. The two become friends, but Lilly senses from the start that Felice wants more from her than mere “friendship”.\n\nAt first, Lilly reacts dismissively to Felice’s courtship. Eventually, however, a passionate love develops between the two women. Even when Lilly, who is married to a devoted Nazi, learns that Felice is Jewish and belongs to a resistance group, she stands by her lover. She divorces her husband and takes Felice into her apartment. For as long as possible, the two women repress the brutal German reality of life at that time and all the impending dangers. Until the Gestapo shows up at their apartment in August 1944.\n\nFor one of them, this forbidden love becomes the decisive experience of her life. For her friend, an intrepidly flamboyant Jewish woman working for an underground organization, it is a play with fire - but also her last chance to wrest a fulfilled piece of life from the murderous regime.\n\nJara seems to have everything: she is happily married, has ideal prospects for a university career, lives in a nice flat and is able to rely on her family who stick together despite the odd difficulty. But when she meets Arie, her father’s friend who is far older than her, this perfect world is completely out of joint‚: she falls for his fascinating erotic, contradictory attractions. Curious and hungry for life, she launches herself into the whirlpool of an amour fou that breaches every dam of her previous existence. In the process, she realises that her parens are guarding a secret to which Arie is the key, but also that no love, no man alone should determine her life....\n\nLena Ferben has been married to her husband Tore for years when she suddenly loses herself. Doctors call Lena’s condition retrograde amnesia; the reason being undiagnosed inflammation of the brain. As a result, she can no longer access what medicine calls biographical memory. And how strangely the brain works: The language is still there, but the words are not linked to any experience. Comedy... fidelity... sex... love... husband...\n\nWords floating in a vacuum, cut off from their basic meanings. Tore tries to help Lena find a way back to what he was to her and she to him: a retelling of a reality already experienced. But while those around her feel only the loss of the old Lena, she herself follows a path of her own.\n\nThe film relates episodes from Austrian writer Stefan Zweig’s life in exile. At the height of his worldwide fame, he was driven to emigrate and despaired over the downfall of Europe, which he had foreseen early on.\n\nIt is the story of a refugee, the story of losing one’s former home and searching for a new one. Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, New York, Petrópolis were four stations of Stefan Zweig’s exile which, despite providing a safe refuge, a hospitable reception and a stunning natural world in the tropics, did not grant him peace and could not replace his homeland.\n\nThe film tells the story of the risky journey of two female journalists who in 2017 uncovered the wide-spread abuse of power against women in the US film business.\n\nMegan Twohey and Jodi Kantor break the great silence in Hollywood: They expose business meetings in hotel rooms as sexual assaults and encounter a web of repression, blackmail and fear. With their courageous research, they not only give the affected women their voice back, but also trigger a worldwide wave of solidarity and cause a tremor not only in Hollywood, but also give the impetus for a change in American society that continues to this day.\n\nThe film traces one of the most important stories of a generation, told by courageous women who, despite great personal risk, decided to to fight back to stop an accused serial offender from doing even more harm. Thanks to their courageous efforts, they were able to stop not only an individual perpetrator, but also the system that made this abuse of power possible in the first place."
