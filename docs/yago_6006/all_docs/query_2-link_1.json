        "text": "Biography:\n\nDani Levy was born in 1957 in Basel, Switzerland. From 1977 to 1979, he was an ensemble member of the Basel Theater and, from 1980 to 1983, of Berlin's Rote Gr端tze Theater. He debuted as a director in 1985 with Du mich auch. In 1994, Levy co-founded the production company X Filme Creative Pool, whose first film was his Stille Nacht, nominated for the 1996 Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. One of his most important projects was the thriller Meschugge, a collaboration with actor and co-writer Maria Schrader on which he had worked for many years. His internationally successful comedy Alles auf Zucker! was awarded six German Film Awards in different categories and became one of the most successful German art house films in 2004. His satirical comedy Mein F端hrer - Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit 端ber Adolf Hitler, with comedian Helge Schneider and renowned actor Ulrich M端he, provoked considerable controversy among German critics."
