        "text": "Canadian actor and filmmaker (born 1983)\n\nFor other people named Daniel Levy, see Daniel Levy (disambiguation).\n\nDaniel Joseph Levy (born August 9, 1983)[1][2] is a Canadian actor and filmmaker. He began his career as a television host on MTV Canada. He received international prominence and critical acclaim for starring as David Rose in the CBC sitcom Schitt's Creek (2015–2020), which he co-created and co-starred in with his father, Eugene Levy.\n\nLevy won Primetime Emmy Awards for producing, writing, directing, and acting in the final season of Schitt's Creek, and the series became the first to win a Primetime Emmy Award in all four major comedy acting categories in a single year.[3] His work on the show also earned him four Canadian Screen Awards, among other accolades.[4] Levy has since played a supporting role in the romantic comedy film Happiest Season (2020), and starred in, written and directed the drama Good Grief (2023).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLevy was born in Toronto, to Eugene Levy and Deborah Divine[5][6] His father is Jewish and his mother is Protestant.[7][non-primary source needed] Levy had a bar mitzvah, and his family celebrates both Christmas and Hanukkah.[8][9] He attended high school at North Toronto Collegiate Institute and later pursued film production at York University and Ryerson University.[6][10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2006–2012: Early work\n\n[edit]\n\nLevy began his career as one of the original seven co-hosts on the now-defunct MTV Canada flagship series MTV Live. He gained prominence as co-host (with Jessi Cruickshank) of MTV Canada's The After Show and its various incarnations, such as The Hills: The After Show and The City: Live After Show.[11] The shows were occasionally broadcast in the United States as well.\n\nFollowing The After Show's cancellation and Cruickshank's departure, Levy wrote, produced, and starred in his own Christmas special for MTV, Daniel Levy's Holi-Do's & Don'ts. He also co-hosted the MTV Movie Awards Red Carpet, the X-Factor pre-show, and national coverage of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics for CTV.[12] He also ran a leg of the Olympic torch relay.[13] He left MTV Canada in 2011 after five years with the network.[14]\n\nAs an actor, he has appeared in a four-episode story arc of the Canadian TV series Degrassi: The Next Generation, which premiered as a TV movie called Degrassi Goes Hollywood. In his Degrassi arc, he played a film producer who hires Paige Michalchuk as the lead in a new film directed by actor Jason Mewes. He also appeared in the 2012 thriller Cyberstalker, and in the 2013 comedy-drama film Admission starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd.[15][16]\n\n2015–2020: Schitt's Creek\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Levy formed Not a Real Company Productions (with his father Eugene Levy and principals Andrew Barnsley and Fred Levy).[16] Their first project was a television pilot with CBC, which resulted in Schitt's Creek.[17] Levy starred in the series alongside his father, sister Sarah Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy, and Chris Elliott.[18][19] Schitt's Creek is Not a Real Company Productions' first television series.[20] Levy has spoken publicly about his character's portrayal of pansexuality, saying, \"I think in certain parts of America, David's sexual ambiguity was a big question mark. (But) it was issues like that that I find quite exciting.\"[21]\n\nFor his work on Schitt's Creek, Levy has been nominated for numerous awards, including several Canadian Screen Awards for writing and acting, winning the awards for Best Comedy Series, Best Writing in a Comedy Program or Series in 2016, and Best Comedy Series in 2019.[22][23] In 2019, the series was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.[24] In March 2019, Levy announced that the series was renewed for a sixth and final season, and said the decision to end the series after season six on their own creative terms was a \"rare privilege\".[25]\n\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Levy would host The Great Canadian Baking Show with Julia Chan, which had its premiere on November 1 on CBC.[26] On October 30, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail criticized the show's first episode in a review, including a critique of Levy's \"feyness\" while performing as host.[27] While acknowledging the importance of criticism in media, Levy called the use of the word feyness \"offensive, irresponsible, and homophobic\".[28][29] The Globe's public editor Sylvia Stead published a statement on November 9 explaining that \"Mr. Doyle was not aware that Mr. Levy was gay and he used the term to mean preciousness\". She also acknowledged that, despite the dictionary not defining \"fey\" as a slur, \"we need to understand not just the context of words, but how they evolve and are viewed by communities that may be justly sensitive to a range of meanings.\"[30] Levy and Chan returned as hosts for the series' second season, which premiered in September 2018.[31] In March 2019, Levy announced via Twitter that he and Chan would not be returning as hosts for the series' third season, citing scheduling conflicts.[32]\n\nIn May 2019, he was the keynote speaker at The Infatuation's annual food festival, EEEEEATSCON.[33]\n\nIn June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots that sparked the start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named him one of the Pride50 \"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\".[34][35]\n\nIn January 2020, he and his father Eugene Levy were guest hosts of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, filling in for DeGeneres while she took a day off. They did many of the ordinary host activities including interviewing fellow Schitt's Creek cast members Catherine O'Hara and Annie Murphy.[36][37]\n\nIn July 2020, Schitt's Creek was nominated for 15 Primetime Emmy Awards for its final season, with Levy winning Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.[38] It became the first comedy series to sweep the four main acting categories in a single year, the first comedy or drama series to win all seven major awards in a single year, and the most-awarded comedy in a single year, beating The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's record. Levy also became the first person to win an award in all four major disciplines in a single year.[39][40][41]\n\n2020–present: Post-Schitt's Creek\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2020, Levy enrolled in and began to promote the 12-week self-paced Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), \"Indigenous Canada\", hosted by Dr. Tracy Bear (Montreal Lake First Nation) and Dr. Paul Gareau (Métis and French Canadian) of the University of Alberta. Levy also hosted twelve livestream interviews with the course instructors and weekly guest speakers to discuss topics related to each of the 12 course modules.[42][non-primary source needed][43] Levy said in a tweet on November 15, 2020, that the weekly discussions were \"nothing short of transformational\".[44] Levy also encouraged followers of and participants in the course to donate to the University of Alberta's Faculty of Native Studies, the only faculty of its kind in North America, promising to match donations up to $25,000.[45]\n\nIn September 2020, Levy starred alongside Bette Midler, Kaitlyn Dever, Sarah Paulson, and Issa Rae in the HBO television film Coastal Elites.[46] The project was shot remotely and focused on the lives of five individuals navigating the COVID-19 pandemic.[47]\n\nOn February 6, 2021, Levy hosted Saturday Night Live with Grammy-nominated musician Phoebe Bridgers as the musical guest.[48]\n\nIn September 2019, Levy signed a three-year deal with ABC Signature.[49][50] In September 2021, it was announced that Levy had signed an overall deal with Netflix to write and produce scripted content across film and TV.[50] Levy later clarified that the film ended up being \"a love story about friendship\".[51] Good Grief, Levy's directorial debut, was released in limited theaters on December 29, 2023, and released on Netflix on January 5, 2024.[52] The film stars Levy, Ruth Negga, Luke Evans, Himesh Patel, Celia Imrie, David Bradley, and Arnaud Valois.[53]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLevy divides his time between Toronto and Los Angeles, while he has said that London is his \"favorite city\" after having lived there in 2005.[54]\n\nHe initially avoided labelling his sexual orientation publicly,[19] though in a 2015 interview with Flare he was called \"a member of the LGBT community\".[55] In a 2020 interview with Andy Cohen, Levy said that he is \"obviously gay\" and has been out since he was 18.[56]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 2012 Cyberstalker Jack Dayton / Unknown Man Credited as Daniel Levy [57] 2013 Admission James Credited as Daniel Joseph Levy [19] 2014 Stage Fright Entertainment Reporter [58] 2017 Robot Bullies Robot 1 Short film [59] 2020 Happiest Season John [60] 2023 Haunted Mansion Vic Good Grief Marc Dreyfus Also director, writer and producer [52] 2024 Unfrosted Andy Warhol 2025 Animal Friends Filming [61] At the Sea Filming [62]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 2006–2010 The Hills: Live After Show Himself / Host Also writer and producer [63] 2006–2011 MTV Live Himself / Host [64] 2009 Degrassi Goes Hollywood Robbie Television film [65] 2010 Daniel Levy's Holi-Do's & Don'ts Himself Television special\n\nAlso writer and producer [66] 2015 Canada's Smartest Person Himself / Judge Episode #2.6 [67] 2015–2020 Schitt's Creek David Rose 80 episodes\n\nAlso co-creator, writer, director, and producer [68] 2017–2018 The Great Canadian Baking Show Himself / Host 16 episodes [69] 2018 Modern Family Jonah Episode: \"A Sketchy Area\" [70] 2019 The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show Narrator Television film [71] 2020 Dishmantled Himself / Judge Episode: \"Holy Schitt!\" [72] Coastal Elites Mark Hesterman Television film [73] 2021 Saturday Night Live Himself / Host Episode: \"Dan Levy/Phoebe Bridgers\" [74] Q-Force Chasten (voice) 2 episodes [75] 2022 The Big Brunch Himself / Host Also creator and executive producer [76] 2023 The Idol Benjamin Episode: \"Pop Tarts & Rat Tales\" [77] Sex Education Mr. Molloy 4 episodes [78] 2024 Curb Your Enthusiasm Abe Zeckelman Episode: \"Fish Stuck\" [79]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Artist Role Ref. 2005 \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" Kelly Clarkson Wedding Guest [80]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2023, he was named a Member of the Order of Canada.[81][82]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
