        "text": "03/05/2021 - The Kangaroo Chronicles, directed by Berlin based Swiss director Dani Levy and released in 2020, was one of the most successful films of the year in Germany and will now be extended by a sequel\n\nFor the second part of the kangaroo saga kicked off with The Kangaroo Chronicles , the author of the stories on which the films are based will take over as director. Marc-Uwe Kling wrote the screenplay for the first film and is now in charge of both the script and the direction of Die Känguru-Verschwörung. He has been supported by Jan Cronauer to adapt the texts from his novels and podcasts to the big screen.\n\nKling had a lot of success in Germany with his satirical stories about a young man who has a kangaroo as his roommate. The animal, the alter ego of the bohemian, dares to say and do things that its human companion doesn't. Through the kangaroo, Kling enables his protagonist — himself an alter ego of the author and carrying the latter’s name — to express some of his political opinions. By the means of absurd humour and fantasy, he criticises the small-minded ideas of the middle-class. Since 2009, Kling has been publishing a series of short stories compilations and has achieved a certain notoriety, which increased even more after the box office results of the first adaptation in 2020. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic and the temporary closing of the cinemas, the film — directed by Dani Levy — reached a total of 375,000 viewers.\n\nFor this second adaptation, the production will work with the same cast. The role of Kling will be played by German actor Dimitrij Schaad and Marc-Uwe Kling will again lend his voice to the kangaroo. The animal will be computer animated in the otherwise live-action film. The female leading role will be played by Rosalie Thomass, supported by actors including Petra Kleinert, Michael Ostrowski, Benno Führmann, Melanie Straub and Volker Zack. Tim Pannen will once more be in charge of the set design, while Markus Nestroy will be responsible for the cinematography."
