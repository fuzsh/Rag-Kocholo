        "text": "For the final film in our Germany on Campus series, we are proud to present Baal (1970), a film lost for nearly half a century and only recently restored for viewing. Director Volker Schlöndorff transported Bertolt Brecht’s 1918 debut play to contemporary West Germany for this vicious experiment in adaptation. Oozing with brutish charisma, Rainer Werner Fassbinder embodies the eponymous anarchist poet, who feels that bourgeois society has rejected him and sets off on a schnapps-soaked rampage.\n\nThink you know all things Deutsch? Come join us, on April 18th at 5 pm in Newcomb 201 for a German Club Trivia Night. Bring your friends and your German knowledge and put it to the test. We will have categories of various German Culture items like music, food, holidays, movies, and vocabulary. We will be allowing teams of 1-3 people. There will be a grand prize of German merchandise for the winning team!\n\nDuring the early days of production on Some Like It Hot, writer-director Billy Wilder purportedly brought in the Texan-born drag artist Barbette, whom he knew from her acclaimed performances in Berlin and Paris in the late 20s and early 30s, to work with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. This talk aims to chronicle the story of Barbette, whose work as a cross-dressing vaudeville and circus artist became an international sensation.\n\nIn 1947, a United States congressional committee which includes prim Phoebe Frost of Iowa arrives in post-World War II Berlin to visit the American troops stationed there. Phoebe hears rumors that cabaret torch singer Erika von Schlütow, suspected of being the former mistress of either Hermann Göring or Joseph Goebbels, is being protected by an unidentified American officer. She enlists Captain John Pringle, another Iowan, to assist in her investigation, unaware that he is Erika's current lover.\n\nPlease join the Department of German and Slavic Studies on Thursday November 11th at 6 pm for a screening of the 2004 comedy film Alles auf Zucker! (English: Go for Zucker!).\n\nDirector Dani Levy's controversial and highly entertaining contemporary farce is one of the first German-Jewish comedies to come out of Germany since World War II. The film has been termed \"an audacious, politically incorrect, self-ironical Jewish comedy\". It was critically acclaimed in Germany and won a number of awards, most notably the 2005 Deutscher Filmpreis in several categories."
