Within the frame of the Open Air Factory, the Pafos2017 Organisation organizes for a third consecutive year its institutional programme “See Fest 2016: Cinema on the Beach”. The audience’s favourite summer cinema promises memorable nights by the sea and under the stars with films that highlight people’s stories, lives and the places that define them.Towns and people, routes that meet or are lost forever… Friday 5th August 2016 Go for sugar (Alles auf Zucker) (2004) Using ruthless humour, wittiness and irony, the film tells the story of a Jewish family that was separated by the erection of the Berlin Wall and has remained, since then, divided and in quarrel. The family meets again in today’s Berlin for the funeral of the mother. A unique comedy with references to Berlin, through shots of well-known areas of the city. *In German with English and Greek subtitles, 95’ Directed by Dani Levy Music: Niki Reiser Wednesday 10th August 2016 To Rome with Love (2012) Four stories unfold in the eternal city. Woody Allen, Penélope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin and Roberto Benigni, strangers in the same city, live and fall in love with the familiar way of the director, and guide us to the monuments and the neighbourhoods of Rome with the necessary accompaniment of Italian music and songs. A charming film, a sample of Woody Allen’s love for Italy and Rome. *In English with Greek subtitles, 111’ Friday 12th August 2016 Plato’s Academy (2009) A different view of the Greek neighbourhood. Stavros and his friends, typical lazy Greek men, lay back all day in front of Stavros’ kiosk. Everything changes, though, when one morning Stavros’ mother recognises an Albanian man as her missing son. *In Greek with English surtitles, 103’ Directed by Filippos Tsitos Cast: Antonis Kafetzopoulos, Anastasis Kozdine, Maria Zorba, Yiorgos Souxes Friday 19th August 2016 Come Back (Volver) (2006) A film with Madrid as a background, where three generations of women coexist with madness, lies and superstition for death, that give a special structure in their daily lives. Raimunda lives in Madrid with her daughter Paula and her husband Paco, who is always drunk. Her sister Sole is divorced and secretly working as a hairdresser. A tragic event from their childhood marks their everyday life and, when their aunt dies, the past returns to haunt them. *In Spanish with Greek and English subtitles, 121′ Directed by Pedro Almodóvar Cast: Carmen Maura, Penélope Cruz, Candela Peña, Yohana Cobo, Chus Lampreave, Antonio de la Torre, Carlos Blanco Wednesday 24th August 2016 Paris, I love you (Paris, je t’ aime) (2006) The Eiffel Tower and the Seine, the paved streets, the squares and monuments, the parks and the underground world, all the magic of Paris unfolds in 18 delightful stories of acclaimed directors from around the world (including the Coen brothers, Walter Salles, Jean-Luc Godard, Alejantro González Iñárritu, Paul Verchofen, Gus Van Sant), who give their own perspective in the subject of “love” having as their orientation the French city. An incredible mosaic of short stories all joined in a single and heady seduction full of romance, love and… the eternal City of Light. *In French with Greek subtitles, 123’ Cast: Juliette Binoche, Fanny Ardant, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Leonor Watling et al. Free Entrance / Information: 26 93 2017 or Pafos2017.eu",
