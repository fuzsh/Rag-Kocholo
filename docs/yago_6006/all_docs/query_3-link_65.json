        "text": "The retrospective of the 57th Hof International Film Festival 2023 is dedicated to the director, author and actress MARIA SCHRADER. Hardly any other German filmmaker has had such a varied as well as remarkable career as MARIA SCHRADER: from a busy, popular actress, to an author and successful director who has made it as far as the USA. Back in 1988 she was in Hof for the first time with Dani Levy to present ROBBYKALLEPAUL, in which she starred and which she also co-wrote.\n\nMARIA SCHRADER is one of Germany's most renowned actresses, who has worked with directors such as Doris Dörrie, Peter Greenaway, Agnieszka Holland, Rainer Kaufmann as well as Margarethe von Trotta. Also, she has celebrated success on the stages of various theaters. In 1999 she received the Silver Bear for “Best Actress” at the Berlinale for AIMÉE & JAGUAR by Max Färberböck. Most recently, she could be seen in the well-known series DEUTSCHLAND 83/86/89 (2015-2020). Early on, MARIA SCHRADER worked with Dani Levy as a writer as well as a co-director. In 2007, she presented her first directorial work of her own, the highly acclaimed film LOVE LIFE, based on the bestseller by Zaruya Shalev. In 2016, she won the Bavarian Film Award for STEFAN ZWEIG: FAREWELL TO EUROPE. The film also earned her a nomination for the German Film Award in the “Best Director” category. In 2021 she then received the Golden Lola for I’M YOUR MAN, as well as the Lola for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and again in 2022 the Bavarian Film Award.\n\nIn total, she realized five feature films. MARIA SCHRADER became internationally known in 2020 as the director of the globally successful mini-series UNORTHODOX for which she won the Emmy Award for “Best Director”. In 2022, she caused a sensation with SHE SAID, her U.S.-produced film, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by New York Times journalists Jodi Kanter and Megan Twohey."
