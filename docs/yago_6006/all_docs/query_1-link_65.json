        "text": "From 25–28 October 2018, the Deutsche Kinemathek is hosting the film heritage festival “Film:ReStored” for the Association of German cinematheques at Kino Arsenal. Now on its third edition, the festival’s program spans eleven for the most part digitally restored works, including Helke Misselwitz’s ENGELCHEN (LITTLE ANGEL) and Christian Petzold’s WOLFSBURG. Screenings will be accompanied by workshop conversations and lectures.\n\nFilm:Restored_03 spotlights relationships between television networks and film archives in transmitting cinematic heritage. The history of German film since the 1960’s would look drastically different without the involvement of television. Much of what became possible in New German Cinema was due in no small part to the commitment of individual commissioning editors in television who continually conducted film funding over decades and were instrumental in shaping careers as well as genre-specific developments.\n\nThe way archives deal with film and television heritage is regulated differently from country to country. In a FIAF lecture, Kieron Webb of the British Film Institute will offer insight into the BFI’s collecting strategy: in its capacity as “National Film & Television Archive,” the BFI is tasked both with building up its extensive film collection and documenting TV programming history. Aside from the BFI presentation, further talks and discussion rounds will focus on diverse facets of the interplay between film archives and television broadcasters. In that spirit, the archive as a source of material for TV documentaries will be another topic. Conversations with network commissioning editors and archivists will address the relationship between production, programming work, and archival strategies. Discussions will cover issues including at times precarious conservation in terms of material and transmitting film history. In that respect, ARTE/ZDF’s commitment to bringing silent films to today’s audiences with newly composed music is exemplary.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, the Prize of the Association of German Cinemas will be awarded in the context of the Film Heritage Festival on the 26th of October, beginning at 8 pm.\n\nAn event by the Deutsche Kinemathek for the Association of German Cinemas. Funded by the Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media, in cooperation with the Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF).\n\nThe full programme can be downloaded in English as a PDF file HERE.\n\nParticipation and Registration\n\nProgram\n\nThursday, 25 October 2018\n\n5:30 pm Welcoming Remarks\n\nRainer Rother, Artistic Director, Deutsche Kinemathek\n\nOpening Film\n\nENGELCHEN (LITTLE ANGEL), Director: Helke Misselwitz, D 1996, DCP, OV w/ Engl. sub, 94 min.
