        "text": "Is Daniel Levy married? Is he a part of the LGBTQ+ community? What is he like off-screen? Does he have a partner?\n\nDaniel Levy has been a big name in show business ever since the major success of his hit show Schitt’s Creek, but how much do you really know about him?\n\nBorn August 9, 1983, Daniel is a Canadian actor, writer, producer, and TV personality. He is also the son of Eugene Levy, the only actor to have appeared in all eight of the American Pie movies.\n\nDaniel Levy is no stranger to the red carpet, but he’s stayed out of the tabloid spotlights and kept his persona pretty clean.\n\nIs Daniel Levy Married? The Answer—and Other Surprising Facts\n\nFor answers to all of these questions and more, keep reading to learn about this rising comedy star.\n\n1. Is Daniel Levy Married?\n\nWhile Dan Levy might be living out a gay love story in Schitt’s Creek, his real-life romance is a little more guarded.\n\nHe tends to stay out of the eye of the media and doesn’t give much attention to magazines or talk-show hosts when it comes to his personal life and romantic endeavors.\n\nThat said, while there’s no clear answer to “is Daniel Levy married?” floating around on the internet, the likely answer is: no.\n\nDan seems to be enjoying his youth and keeping his dating life private, at least for now. Is a showstopper wedding in his future? Wait and see.\n\n2. Is He a Part of the LGBTQ+ Community?\n\nMany people who see Dan Levy’s character, David, on Schitt’s Creek love the pansexual representation. There’s a lack of pan representation in popular media, and a lot of people worry about pan erasure. But is he pansexual in real life?\n\nWhile Dan Levy isn’t pan in real life, he is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Daniel came out as a gay man when he was 18 years old. His parents were supportive, luckily, and he was able to thrive in his Hollywood community.\n\nDan wanted the pansexual representation in his show despite it not quite matching up with his “real life” sexuality. Even though the character doesn’t perfectly represent him, he loved the idea of not having to fit perfectly inside of a box and not being asked to.\n\n3. What Else Has Daniel Levy Done?\n\nIf you haven’t been paying attention, Levy might have popped up out of nowhere directly onto the set of Schitt’s Creek. To people in the know with reality television, though, Daniel Levy isn’t a new name.\n\nHe’s hosted or guest-hosted several shows since he was 21 years old. He worked on MTV Canada!\n\nHe has also hosted the Great Canadian Baking Show, a sister to the Great British Baking Show that so many people know and love.\n\nAlongside his reality TV work, he pops up as a guest in acting roles, with appearances on Modern Family, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and other shows. Have you spotted him recently?\n\nIn December 2013, Dan Levy released his first movie as a director, called Good Grief. Set in a small town in the countryside, it follows a young woman, Lucy, as she grapples with the sudden death of her father. As Lucy navigates grief, she finds solace and support in unexpected places, forging connections with her quirky neighbors.\n\n4. Was He Born Famous?\n\nIf his name sounds familiar (or his signature eyebrows tipped you off), you might be on to something.\n\nDaniel Levy is the son of Eugene Levy (major film star and his on-screen dad on Schitt’s Creek), but that didn’t necessarily give him a straight shot to stardom.\n\nHis parents kept him and his sister (also a Schitt’s Creek regular) out of the limelight to give them a more normal childhood. Dan Levy even worked at a video store before his rise to fame (does that sound familiar?).\n\nSo, in part, yes he was born famous. He wasn’t born with the way paved for him, though.\n\n5. Can You Get His Style?\n\nWell, kind of.\n\nWhile you might not be able to steal his look (which doesn’t match David’s, bonus fact!) you can totally get his eyewear style for yourself.\n\nDan Levy has his own eyewear line that you can cop and wear to match his signature style.\n\nHe’s a man of many talents, and acting is only one of them. Fashion and design is another, and it’s a strong one!\n\n6. What Did He Do for Schitt’s Creek?\n\nDan Levy isn’t only an actor in his hit show.\n\nSchitt’s Creek is the brainchild of Dan and Eugene who worked together to pitch and create the program for a Canadian Network.\n\nWhile they both obviously have starring roles, and the roles, in ways, reflect real life, they also worked behind the scenes.\n\nThe show is a family affair, with Dan, Eugene, and Sarah Levy all working together to bring it to life. Dan specifically wanted to create a world within his show where inclusivity thrived and homophobia didn’t exist.\n\nThis show wasn’t just acted out by Dan, he helped make it too.\n\n7. Is Dan Levy Confident?\n\nWhenever we see actors, we imagine them to be the epitome of confidence and grace. The reality, however, isn’t always so clear.\n\nDaniel Levy is open about his experiences with shyness and anxiety, and how they impacted his career in and out of the Hollywood red carpet and limelight.\n\nWorking on-screen is hard, and it’s harder still when one is afraid of strangers or messing up. Do you think working alongside his family helped him out?\n\nAnxiety and confidence don’t necessarily conflict, but it’s nice to see a celebrity as human sometimes.\n\nDan Levy, a Rising Star within the Queer Community\n\nIt’s normal to want to know everything about your favorite celebrity. “Is Daniel Levy married?”, “Is Dan Levy an LGBTQ+ actor?” and other questions are likely pop into your mind if you’re a fan of Schitt’s Creek. You’re not alone.\n\nRepresentation is important and learning about celebrities who are openly LGBTQ+ is empowering.\n\nIn 2019, Levy was featured in OUT Magazine’s “Out 100” list of the year’s most impactful LGBTQ+ leaders. In March 2020, he was bestowed with the HRC Visibility Award. Personally, I can’t wait to see what Dan Levy does next in show business—or life.\n\nWant to stay in the loop?
