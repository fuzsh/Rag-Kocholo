        "text": "Daniel Levy is a multi-hyphenate EmmyÂ® award winning showrunner, writer, actor, director, and producer who has built his career telling vibrant and comedic stories, establishing himself as a Hollywood mainstay.\n\nLevy recently launched his new film and television production company, Not a Real Production Company. Not A Real Production Company debuted its first series, The Big Brunch, on HBO Max in November 2022. Levy not only created the series but also hosts and serves as a judge alongside Chef Sohla El-Waylly and restaurateur Will Guidara. Additionally, the company has several projects in various stages of development including an adult animated comedy Standing By for Hulu, which he co-created with Ally Pankiw. Levy is currently in post-production on his directorial debut Good Grief, an original film at Netflix, which he wrote, produced and stars in. The company recently began its new overall television deal with Netflix, where it also has a first-look feature film deal.\n\nUp next, Levy will be joining the season 4 cast of Netflix's acclaimed dramedy Sex Education playing the character Thomas Molloy, a famous author, and Maeve's (Emma Mackey) US course tutor at her Ivy League college. Levy has also joined the ensemble cast of HBO Max's upcoming series The Idol, created by Sam Levinson and The Weeknd, as well as Disney's upcoming Haunted Mansion remake. Recently, Levy appeared in Hulu's holiday rom-com Happiest Season, and starred alongside Bette Midler, Sarah Paulson, Issa Rae, and Kailtyn Dever in HBO's Coastal Elite. Levy made his hosting debut on Saturday Night Live in February 2021.\n\nLevy is best known for his work on one of the most beloved shows on television, Schitt's Creek, which he co-created with his father Eugene Levy. The series received nine EmmyÂ® wins for its sixth and final season, breaking major records becoming the most awarded comedy series in a single year, the first comedy or drama series to sweep all four acting categories and receiving the most wins for a comedy series in its final season. Levy and his father also became the first father-son pair to win Emmys in the same year, and Levy impressively tied the record for most wins by an individual in a single season with four total wins. Additionally, in its final season, Schitt's Creek garnered dozens of awards and more than 100 nominations including: five Critics Choice Award nominations, securing two wins for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actress in a Comedy Series; five SAG Award nominations, collecting two wins for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and Actress in a Comedy Series; GLAAD Media Award win for Best Comedy Series; won a Canadian Screen Award for Best Comedy; two TCA Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy; and a Costume Design Guild Award for Excellence in Contemporary Television. Levy was also recognized as one of the Grand Marshals for NYC Pride 2020. In 2019, the show received four EmmyÂ® nominations including Best Comedy Series, a 2019 TCA Award nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy, Levy won Best Comedic Performance at the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and was honored by GLAAD with the Davidson/Valentini Award.\n\nLevy began his television career co-hosting MTV Canada's flagship show MTV Live and later co-wrote, co-hosted, and co-produced the critically-acclaimed ratings hit The After Show and its various incarnations, including The Hills: The After Show and The City: Live After Show. Levy also wrote, produced, and starred in his own Christmas special for MTV, Daniel Levy's Holi-Do's & Don'ts, co-hosted the MTV Movie Awards Red Carpet, the X-Factor pre-show, national coverage of the Vancouver Olympic Games for CTV, co-hosted The Great Canadian Baking Show, and has also made a guest appearance on Modern Family. Levy made his film debut opposite Tina Fey in \"Admission\".\n\nLevy and Not A Real Production Company are repped by WME, MGMT Entertainment, 42West and Morris Yorn."
