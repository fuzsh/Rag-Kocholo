        "text": "\"I just beat Hitler,\" the German actor Henry Hubchen proudly said some two weeks ago as he went up to the podium in Berlin at the German film academy's award ceremony. Hubchen won the prize for best lead actor for his role in \"Alles auf Zucker!,\" and bested the man thought to be the leading candidate, Bruno Ganz, who played Hitler in the film \"Downfall.\"\n\nHubchen wasn't the only one to beat Hitler; the entire crew of \"Alles auf Zucker!\" beat \"Downfall\" with an impressive achievement: The comedy about the life of Jews in Germany today swept six German film academy awards, including best picture and best director, whereas \"Downfall\" did not win a single prize, contrary to early predictions. The newspaper headlines in Germany after the ceremony declared \"a Jewish comedy beat out the drama about Hitler.\"\n\n\"Downfall,\" directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, about the last days of the Nazi Fuehrer, was the most successful German film at the box office in the past year. Five million Germans saw it, and it was also Germany's representative at the Oscar award ceremony (and managed to make it into the final five in the best foreign language film category, but did not win). On the other hand, fewer than one million filmgoers in Germany have so far seen \"Alles auf Zucker!\" and the film did not receive any international attention.\n\nMoreover, if the quality of the two films is considered - \"Downfall\" is a multilayered drama whereas \"Alles auf Zucker!\" is just a shallow comedy - it would be hard not to wonder whether the German film academy's choice was another attempt at atonement, rather than one based purely on artistic considerations.\n\nDani Levy, the director of \"Alles auf Zucker!\", who was a guest at the Jerusalem International Film Festival last week, does not think so. \"My film is simply better and more intelligent than \"Downfall,\" he says. \"When I saw `Downfall,' I was stunned. Perhaps the intention behind the film was good, but the end result is propaganda for the Third Reich. I don't want to see Hitler crying, unless it's shown in a comedy,\" says Levy. \"Five million Germans saw this film with at least one million students among them; they see it as history, as a true thing, and that's dangerous. The entire film is based on compassion.\"\n\nHe agrees that \"Downfall\" is part of the efforts of historians and many artists to clear German citizens of their share of guilt for World War II and to present them as victims of Nazism also, but sees nothing wrong with that. \"During the war, millions of Germans were killed. True, many Germans followed Hitler, but they were not more than 50 percent. The rest, who opposed the regime, were not brave enough to fight the power and cruelty of the system,\" he says.\n\nThe rabbi and the gambler\n\n\"Alles auf Zucker!\" which opens in Israel next Thursday, is the 10th film by Levy, a German-Jewish director. The film's lead characters are two Jewish brothers - Jaeckie Zucker, a secular man married to a German woman, a compulsive gambler and a billiards champion, and Samuel Zuckermann, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, whose two children are also Orthodox. The former lives with his family in communist East Germany and the latter in West Germany. The two brothers haven't spoken to each other in 40 years, but after their mother's death, they are forced to meet, in order to bury her.\n\nIn her will, the mother leaves her money to her two sons, but only on the condition that they reconcile. She orders them to spend time together in her home, sit shiva (the seven-day mourning period for an immediate family member required by Judaism) for her and forgive each other. If they do so, she will split all her assets between them, and if they don't uphold the terms of the will, the money will go to Jewish institutions.\n\nLevy's film is a slapstick comedy. In one scene the ultra-Orthodox Jew (who is referred to as \"Uncle Ayatollah\") swallows an Ecstasy pill and then, partially nude, spends time with a Palestinian girl. Other scenes show two sets of cousins: the rabbi's daughter, a young and sensuous woman who tries to seduce her non-Jewish cousin and the rabbi's son, who is also ultra-Orthodox, who it turns out had sex years ago with his secular cousin and got her pregnant, and she is now raising with her partner the daughter born from that liaison.\n\n\"There was no way a non-Jewish director could do such a film,\" says Levy, referring to the way Jews are depicted in \"Alles auf Zucker!.\" Levy, too, had a hard time achieving the screenplay he wanted. He wrote the first outline of the film in 1996, but didn't manage to raise funds to produce it.\n\n\"The film fund and television network managers in Germany were never genuinely honest when they explained the problems they had with my film,\" says Levy. \"They just didn't want to do a film about minorities. Germany indeed does not deny its multiculturalism, but leading film industry executives didn't think that films dealing with multicultural subjects would be able to draw viewers to the box office.\n\n\"But it's a worldwide problem, not necessarily only in Germany. How many films about homosexuals are produced around the world, and how many films have blacks in the lead role? They were just afraid of being politically incorrect. It took me time to explain to them that I'm not laughing at Jews, I just know them, I'm one of them.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Israeli viewers receive \"Alles auf Zucker!\" and whether it will be as successful here as it was among viewers and critics in Germany. A review of the film in the German newspaper Die Welt said: \"This comedy, which is wonderful in its political incorrectness, laughs at itself and at the contemporary Jewish lifestyle. Levy creates a portrait of human neuroses and German-Jewish relationships in a pleasant way and is not afraid to touch on subjects considered taboo.\"\n\nMoney is the main motivation of the brothers from the house of Zuckermann. The secular son Zucker is a compulsive gambler who gets beat up by the people he cheats. Because he is mired in debt, he signs up for a national billiards tournament and hopes to win. The ultra-Orthodox brother also has elements of the stereotyped money-loving Jew. He discovers that his brother cheated him as well and to duck their mother's demand that they sit shiva together, Zucker pretends to have heart trouble and is supposedly taken to the hospital, so that he can basically carry on with his gambling. However, the ultra-Orthodox Zuckermann doesn't say anything because he wants to inherit.\n\n\"What's the problem with the fact that the Jewish characters like money?\" Levy asks. \"Let's stop with these cliches as if only Jews like money. I like money. Everyone likes money, and I don't care what people think about that.\n\n\"My fear is that the only Jewish character appearing in German film will remain the Jew in the Holocaust. That to me is terrible. We should feel comfortable even when we, the Jews are just regular people who behave normally, make mistakes and simply live. I believe the social taboos should be broken.\"\n\nLevy defines his film as \"a Jewish film\" and himself as someone \"who is proud to be a Jew and loves his Judaism.\"\n\nLevy, 47, was born in Basel after his parents fled Germany in 1939. In 1980, he moved from Switzerland to Berlin - a move that was not well received by his parents. \"My mother was in shock,\" he says. \"I wasn't aware of the problematic nature in this act of going back to live on German soil. I didn't even think about the effect this move would have on my family. Five years later, I started creating works that had Jews as their focus. I felt it was my obligation to revive a culture that the Third Reich had destroyed. For me, \"Alles auf Zucker!\" is my revenge, as if I'm saying, `You didn't kill us.'\"\n\nFor years, he has lived with the German actress-screenwriter Maria Schrader, who played Jaguar, a Jewish woman living with a German woman married to a Nazi, in the film \"Aimee and Jaguar.\"\n\nSchrader is now working on her premiere as a director: a film version of Zeruya Shalev's novel, \"Love Life,\" which was a stunning success when it was published in Germany. Filming will begin in November in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Acre, and the actress Selma Blair will play the lead. Like \"Alles auf Zucker!,\" the German production company X-Filme Creative Pool, which Levy owns, will produce \"Love Life.\" Levy's company has in recent years produced such German box-office hits as \"Good Bye, Lenin,\" \"Run Lola Run\" and \"The Princess and the Warrior.\""
