        "text": "I’m sure a lot of this would be lot funnier if I was actually German, but it really fell flat in the end. This is a very solid premise for a comedy, but the execution felt very underwhelming. Everything was there, but the moments that needed to be emphasized weren’t there and the moments that were intended to be funny came and went without a second thought. Also I know it’s a cultural thing, but what’s with all the cousin sex stuff I feel like that really didn’t need to be there, and dare I say it really shouldn’t have been.\n\nDidn’t pay too much attention to this. I was busy playing Out of the Park Baseball 21. I won three games in a row because I’m a genius at sports management. All that really left an impression on me from the movie was the incest. Germans make me uncomfortable, especially when they look like they’re German.\n\nIf you ever wanted to watch a movie about a guy that has to play in a pool tournament to win money to turn his life around while having to sit shiva for seven days for his recently departed mother....then Go For Zucker is for you. Lots of twists and turns in this one......but in the end...this one was just alright."
