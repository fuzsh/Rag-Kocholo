        "meta_description": "Dani Levy's highly entertaining contemporary farce Go For Zucker is one of the first German-Jewish comedies to come out of Germany since World War II. The cultural phenomenon dominated the German Film Awards, picking up six Lolas including Best Picture. Go For Zucker centers on two brothers — Jaeckie Zucker, a hard-living, hustling former East German celebrity sportscaster, and his quasi-Orthodox brother Samuel from the West. Jaeckie is up to his ears in debt again — facing jail, divorce and general ruin — when word comes that his mother has died, leaving an inheritance. But according to his mother's will, before he can cash in Zucker first must reconcile with his long-estranged brother, who is arriving the next day, family in tow, expecting to sit shiva for seven days. Can the secular Zucker and his non-Jewish wife pass as observant? And will he be able to sneak away to compete in a high-stakes pool tournament?",
