        "text": "It’s extremely strange that someone like Shawn Levy exists in show business; his lack of talent is pretty self-evident and simply glancing at a list of his films is enough to convince anybody that he’s a second-rate shit peddler. Levy if you don’t know, is a mediocre director (and that’s putting it lightly). He is responsible for The Pink Panther remake, The Cheaper By The Dozen remake, Just Married, The Internship, and let’s not forget Night At The Museum 1, 2, and 3! And yet even with a string of dismally crap movies to his name, he is allowed to further his career in the so-called entertainment business as if he has some flair with a camera, when all evidence has surely proven otherwise.\n\nShawn Levy began his career directing TV shows such as The Secret World Of Alex Mack, Lassie, and surprisingly one episode of the underrated show Do Over… and apparently that’s enough of a resume to be unleashed onto the world of film. Following a couple of uninspired television shows, Levy began his career directing forgettable films like Big Fat Liar, and yet even with such a run-of-the-mill film under his belt, he was allowed to make more celluloidal garbage almost as if Hollywood had a shortage of mediocre bullshit.\n\nYou’d think one bad movie would be enough, possibly two, but with several shite flicks to his name it’s now beginning to look suspicious why this guy still has a career, in fact it’s probably an achievement in itself that a director can make this many lame movies and still be employed. Levy’s filmography reads like the shopping list of a divorced middle-aged father, his films the visual equivalent of a depressed dad trying to convince his family that he’s still “fun”. And yet despite his films being the most dreadful wannabe comedies ever to grace the silver screen, they have made huge profits (apparently his movies have cumulatively grossed $2 billion!) If proof was ever needed that the masses make all the wrong decisions and keep the crappiest entertainment in profit, Levy is it.\n\nShawn Levy’s films are either slightly shit (Date Night) or utterly shit (The Internship) and it’s weird that he’s able to make so many unexceptional movies without someone giving him an award for intentionally being the shittiest director in Hollywood. Real Steel is probably the best film that Levy has created during his pursuit of filmic shittery, but when you take into account that his only tolerable movie is a complete rip-off of Over The Top, it makes you wonder if he’ll ever create anything original (and not worthy of landfill).\n\nWatching any of Shawn Levy’s films is mind and arse-numbingly boring; forget paint, sitting through one of Levy’s movies is like watching shit dry. His films may be labelled “comedies” but they’re almost the opposite of funny, sucking out the atmosphere from a room like a vortex of misery, the inclusion of a comedian like Steve Martin isn’t even enough to detract from the sheer unfunniness on show.\n\nLooking like Aidan Gillen’s plainer, perpetually-happy twin, you have to wonder what this guy is constantly grinning about since he’s responsible for almost obliterating film comedy. For the moment at least, Levy as a director thankfully has no further films in the pipeline, but unfortunately as a producer he’s got numerous films in the works. Judging from his past efforts such as The Watch and Pink Panther 2, these will all probably be as shite as everything else he’s been responsible for. God only knows why this hack is still working in Hollywood."
