        "text": "From Radio 4 to the big screen, via the Linton Travel Tavern: how did Alan Partridge become the man he is today? In this piece from 2013, before the release of the film Alpha Papa, Steve Coogan and his writers talk to Stuart Husband about the character’s past, present and future\n\n1. The rise\n\nAlan Partridge made his debut as a hapless sports reporter (“What is the biggest road you have driven on?” he asked a French racing driver) in 1991 on Radio 4’s On the Hour. That series’s team of writers and performers – Steve Coogan, Armando Iannucci, Chris Morris, Rebecca Front, Peter Baynham, Patrick Marber – would turn out to be the Manhattan Project of late 20th-century comedy, with Alan as their most excruciating and enduring creation. A social maladroit from Norwich, he’s weirdly obsessed with groin injuries and ladyboys, utterly convinced of his own superiority, and bewildered by the world’s inability to recognise it – qualities that placed him in a comedy lineage that runs directly through Hancock, Captain Mainwaring and Basil Fawlty.\n\nHe shone brightest when the format transferred to television as The Day Today in 1993, and was later given his own chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You, where his catchphrase (“Ah-ha!”) was coined, and his arrogance and pettiness reached full flower: “Your autobiography, what’s that all about?” was one of his more enlightened lines of inquiry.\n\nArmando Iannucci: We were on the floor instantly when we heard this voice, it was just so right, and someone instantly said “he’s an Alan,” and someone else said “he’s a Partridge.” Just like that.\n\nSimon Greenall (plays Michael, the Geordie security man, in I’m Alan Partridge and Alpha Papa): I was at college with Steve and I’ve known him for 28 years. We used to do a college radio thing for the BBC and he did a character very similar to Alan then, a sort of fledgling Partridge. A lot of the pedantry and the joy of correcting people that Alan has? That definitely comes from Steve.\n\nIannucci: I remember, at the beginning, there was some discussion as to whether Alan should come from Milton Keynes, but that seemed too obvious, and we’d never heard of a major comedy character who’d come from Norwich, plus, the thing about Norwich is that it’s geographically just that little bit annoyingly too far from London, and has this weird kind of isolated feel that seemed right for Alan.\n\nCoogan: When I’m riffing on Alan, getting in the groove with him, I find it quite joyful and even visceral sometimes. It’s like flying. I’m a big fan of Billy Wilder, and his comedies are larger than life, but there’s always an inherent truth in the way his characters behave.\n\nIannucci: You’re constantly reminded that Alan is only a right angle from reality. There was the thing with John Inverdale recently, where he wondered if Marion Bartoli’s dad had told her she’d never be a looker, so she’d better pick up a tennis racket. If he’d gone on to describe her manly facial features and her traction engine thighs and how she packs a mighty big punch for a little lady, and then expressed bewilderment that anyone could have detected a scintilla of sexism in his comments, that’d be pure Partridge. He’d take these slips, or gaffes or whatever you want to call them, and build them up to a baroque crescendo.\n\n2. The fall\n\nFollowing his show’s cancellation – he accidentally shot a guest dead on air, and then whacked the BBC’s commissioning editor in the face with a turkey during a Christmas special – Alan retreated to a Linton Travel Tavern, “equidistant to London and Norwich”. From there he worked a graveyard slot on Norwich radio while desperately pitching ideas to the BBC for new shows, including the legendary Monkey Tennis.\n\nHis world, as seen in two series of I’m Alan Partridge (1997 and 2003), was one of Black & Decker workmates, Lexus saloon cars, Directors Bitter, fungal foot powder, and estrangement from his wife Carol (who ran off with her fitness instructor), and his children, Fernando and Denise. His emotional hinterland may have been bleak, but his crassness – he couldn’t decide whether to name his new-build Ace House or Excalibur Cottage – remained indomitable.\n\nIannucci: The pathos of those series was unexpected – we were just speculating on where Alan might end up after his fall from grace, and took it from there. While we were researching it, Steve and Patrick Marber and myself went to a motorway service station hotel that actually was equidistant from London and Norwich, and we stayed there for 24 hours. Most people would check in, have dinner, have breakfast, and get the hell out, but we actually lingered to have lunch. And it was appalling.\n\nIt was coming up to Valentine’s Day, and they had a poster up extolling their “romantic package,” that said something like: “£50 gets you a candlelit dinner for two, with complementary half-bottle of champagne (not to be taken into the main bar area).” We had a camcorder, and Steve was doing a conducted tour of the place as Alan. We got outside on the forecourt, with the wind howling and the cars roaring by, and he turned to camera and said: “Yes, it’s got everything, but I have to admit, I don’t want to die here.” That’s when it struck us that there was some depth to this situation – a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England – that we could explore.\n\nFelicity Montagu (plays Alan’s long-suffering PA, Lynn, in I’m Alan Partridge and Alpha Papa): Comedy needs a bit of pain in it for me. If I’m watching one of those American shows that’s just about zingy one-liners I switch it off because I don’t care about those characters. It can be cruel, but it’s got to come from some place that feels real.\n\nIannucci: I think the Partridge stuff is some of the hardest work we do as writers. It’s very easy to write things that Alan would say. What’s difficult is reining him in and making sure that the world around him is vivid, that the characters stand up and the structure is sound. With I’m Alan Partridge, we wanted to tell the story entirely from his point of view, so we had to make sure that he was in every scene. It almost drove me insane.\n\nMontagu: Everyone thought I was corpsing along with Sally Phillips in some of those scenes in I’m Alan Partridge, desperately trying not to laugh. But actually, it was simply that Lynn was constantly mortified by Alan’s behaviour and was bowing her head in shame. So I’d like to set the record straight on that.\n\n3. The comeback\n\nAfter a gap of seven years, Alan returned in 2010 with Mid-Morning Matters, a series of YouTube shorts which found him further downsized, DJ-ing on the micro-station North Norfolk Digital. The shorts were eventually picked up by Sky Atlantic, which also commissioned Alan’s guide to Norwich (Welcome To The Places Of My Life) and Open Books, in which he discussed his literary influences (it turns out his favourite Dickens character is “Mr Tickle”) while publicising his autobiography, I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan, published in 2011, a bestseller whose postmodern brio was such that David Baddiel, only half in jest, suggested it should be nominated for the Booker. Alan’s third, fourth and fifth winds were given impetus by the recruitment of two new writers to the team, 36-year-old twins Rob and Neil Gibbons.\n\nNeil Gibbons: We submitted a script to Baby Cow, Steve’s production company, just before his last live tour. He invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid-Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though there was a sense that we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again.\n\nCoogan: I think the BBC may have gone for Mid-Morning Matters if we’d pushed, but we wanted to do it online because it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank.\n\nNeil Gibbons: We had six weeks to pull everything together for the book. You start to see everything through the Partridge prism.\n\nRob Gibbons: And you start to absorb it. I went home the other day and looked at my Sky Plus, and the three things I’d recorded were: a National Geographic show called Mega-Engineering; another called The Golden Age Of The Tram; and another called Extreme Trains. That’s why it’s sometimes hard to know where Steve ends and Alan starts. We’ll all be sat round the writing table, and Steve will say something like, I saw a great episode of Air Crash Investigation last night…\n\nNeil Gibbons: Or, I’m going to buy another Morgan 3-wheeler…\n\nRob Gibbons: And you’ll be laughing and writing it all down and he’ll say, er, no, hello, it’s me, Steve.\n\nCoogan: People say I’ve become more like Alan, which isn’t strictly true – Alan’s become more like me. We share a keen interest in engineering, for example.\n\nRob Gibbons: Like any famous creation, he’s fallen in and out of love with him over the years, I think. I admired his honesty when he called his last tour Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters. It’s funny how he doesn’t always remember the details of previous Partridges. He’ll be walking down the street and someone will yell some old Partridge line at him – “spinal cords in baps!” or whatever – and he just thinks someone’s slagging him off or accusing him of something heinous.\n\nIannucci: After series two of I’m Alan Partridge, I thought that was it – the character was kind of dead in my head. But with Mid-Morning Matters we were introducing ourselves to him again, relaxing into his skin again, remembering how funny we found him, and the fact that he always makes us laugh every day, even if, after sitting in a room with Steve doing him for 12 hours, I'm quite relieved to get out and get home. So that was what finally made us think that we could go and do the film.\n\n4. The film\n\nFinally, two decades on, Alan makes his big-screen debut in Alpha Papa, in which he at last gets to play the hero – albeit an accidental one – when a disgruntled fellow North Norfolk Digital DJ, sacked during a corporate takeover, returns with a shotgun to hold the station’s employees hostage. Alan becomes chief negotiator, though the chief joy for long-time fans will be the surfeit of asinine Partridge-ese on display: at one point he invites his listeners to nominate “the worst monger… iron, fish, rumour, war…”\n\nDeclan Lowney (Alpha Papa director): There was a real sense that we were dealing with something precious here; a character that means an awful lot to a lot of people. Steve took me aside, three weeks in, and said, if this comes out and it's not good, I’m going to be crucified. So “don’t f--- it up” was the mantra.\n\nIannucci: With the movie, we always thought, let’s not rush into it, do it for the sake of it, say yes to the first offer, or go all Hollywood; let’s make it when it feels right. So we’re staying true to Alan, we’re keeping it in Norwich, and we’re not going mental, as Alan would say, but I of course would never say.\n\nAlso, the world’s moved on and so has Alan. He used to be very Thatcherite, but now he’s a bit more what I’d call a modern conservative, trying to keep up with a world in which Cameron embraces gay marriage. He’s gone from wearing blazers to wearing chunky sports jackets and cultivating a borderline-foppish fringe.\n\nIannucci: Alan’s dress sense has evolved to the “Top Gear Presenter Circa 2005” stage. I think he regards himself as being up to speed on political correctness, not getting it but attempting to pay lip service to it.\n\nGreenall: Dame Edna’s about the only comparison I can think of to Alan when it comes to long-running comic characters, and they’re both creations of two very clever men who are slightly at odds with society themselves, outsiders in a way.\n\nMontagu: There’s a little bit of Alan Partridge in most men, isn’t there? They want to be powerful but so many of them feel so powerless. Alan’s almost a study in powerlessness, but his lack of guile and his gormlessness save him from his worst excesses. I think he probably wasn’t brought up very well – he was either spoilt or ignored – and he’s inadequate and delusional and desperately lonely and incapable of making a good relationship. Comedy gold, in other words.\n\nIannucci: I actually think he’s the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum. And if he can ever be said to be at peace, I think he is. He’s happy to be a minor celebrity in a region within a region.\n\nTwenty years ago he was like Icarus; he flew too high and got so badly burnt he could only be identified through dental records. He tells people he’s got over the London thing, the BBC thing. I think he now sees himself as a thrusting local entrepreneur type. And Steve has grown into him, more or less literally. He can develop the “Partridge paunch” much more quickly these days.\n\nCoogan: I think Alan can continue for as long as I’m doing him because I want to and not because I have to pay a mortgage or something. I’ve also got enough other stuff under my belt – the work with Michael Winterbottom, a new Stephen Frears drama called Philomena that I wrote – that I don’t feel like I can be accused of being a one-trick pony with Alan. I think there’s lots of scope for him to go on being a conduit for what’s going on in society, a not-very-well-filtered filter.\n\nIannucci: I’d say that, with Alan, we’re now at the never-say-never stage.\n\nNeil Gibbons: I think Alan would be delighted with the film, but the only thing he’d take issue with would be the poster line – “coming to cinemas August 7”. He’d never stand for that. It would have to be “the 7th of August”.\n\nRob Gibbons: The future? I’d like to do a road movie with Alan. But it wouldn’t be Route 66. It would be the A148 from Cromer to Swaffham."
