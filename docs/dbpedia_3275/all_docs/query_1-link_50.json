        "text": "Comedy tends to travel badly across national borders. I’m sure there are sidesplitting performers in France, Japan, and Australia, but I can’t name a single one. And while this has been historically less true of British comedians—Americans are familiar with the likes of Peter Sellers, Peter Cook, and the Monty Python gang—their work at home was usually more potent than the work they did here.\n\nThe best current example is Steve Coogan, the comedian, actor, and writer who Brits think of (in their favorite cliché) as a national treasure. By now, Coogan has been in enough big movies (including Tropic Thunder, Night at the Museum, and Philomena) that his face is familiar to Americans. And if you saw The Trip, where he and pal Rob Brydon drive around the English countryside trying to one-up each other—their dueling Michael Caine impersonations are worth the price of admission—you know he’s one of the funniest men alive.\n\nStill, unless you live in certain PBS regions or rent DVDs of foreign TV, you almost certainly won’t have seen Coogan playing his greatest and most beloved comic creation—the cluelessly narcissistic media personality Alan Partridge. This is a bit like knowing Stephen Colbert without ever having seen The Colbert Report. Even as Coogan has ventured into more artistically ambitious fare (in this he reminds me of Bill Murray), he has continued to play this uproarious character on and off for the past 20 years. Over that time Alan has grown from being a vain, selfish, egregiously un-PC television and radio host—imagine a piñata labeled SHOWBIZ HORROR—to becoming something a tad more likable: a middle-aged muddler who works for Radio Norwich and is gradually inching his way toward being a slightly better human being.\n\nThat’s where we find him in Alan Partridge, an enjoyable new comedy that’s very silly in a very smart way. Its vaguely satirical premise could hardly be wispier. Alan’s station gets taken over by a corporation whose bosses are so cretinously vulgar they would make the Wolf of Wall Street cringe. Although he’s terrified of losing his job spinning oldies and offering inane chatter (“Question of the Hour: Why do people insist on refrigerating their eggs?”), the bosses fire another DJ, Pat Farrell (Colm Meaney), who responds by taking everyone hostage during a company party. Alan escapes, but because he’s Pat’s friend—insofar as anyone so self-absorbed as Alan can have friends—the cops send him back in as a hostage negotiator. Naturally, he tries to turn this siege to career advantage with results so predictably cringeful that even his servile assistant, wonderfully played by Felicity Monatgu, is horrified.\n\nNow, as a devoted Cooganaut, I’d recommend that you wait to see this movie until you’ve rented or streamed this character’s earlier antics in the series Knowing Me, Knowing You and I’m Alan Partridge. Both are supremely funny and prepare you for the latest stages of Alan’s downward slide. Yet even if you don’t, Alan Partridge will almost certainly make you laugh out loud. It offers everything from Coogan’s masterful slapstick (there’s a classic bit in which Alan tries to hide his nudity from cameras) to Alan’s cleverly chuckleheaded patter. “That was soft-rock cocaine enthusiasts Fleetwood Mac,” he tells his morning show audience after a song finishes.\n\nWhat makes this so great is that Coogan’s comic inventiveness goes beyond mere shtick. He doesn’t just play Alan Partridge, he inhabits him. He gives us Alan’s fame-addled prancing when he thinks the TV cameras are upon him. He gives us Alan’s panicky gape when he realizes he’s been caught doing something small. He gives us Alan’s small shock of awareness when he realizes he’s said something offensive, or when it suddenly (and briefly) dawns on him that other people actually exist independent of his own need for them. And he does it all with an affection that never grows soggy.\n\nEven if this big-screen comedy never quite reaches the biting sublimity of the small-screen series, whose flat, cheesy sitcom aesthetics mesh perfectly with Alan’s own flat, cheesy soul, you won’t want to miss it. Already a big hit in Britain, Alan Partridge is almost certainly the funniest movie you’ll see until The Trip to Italy starring—who else?—Steve Coogan."
