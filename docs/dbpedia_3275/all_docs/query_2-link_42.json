        "text": "Let’s investigate a brilliant British comedy TV show and use it to learn English. The Day Today was originally broadcast on the BBC in the mid-90s and is now considered a groundbreaking parody of news programmes and launched the careers of various comedians, including Steve Coogan.\n\n[DOWNLOAD]\n\nIntroduction Transcript, Notes & Videos\n\nHello folks, this episode is called British Comedy: The Day Today and in this one we’ll be looking at another classic bit of British TV Comedy.\n\nFirst I’ll tell you everything you need to know about the show and then we’ll listen to some clips and I’ll explain the language for you.\n\nThis time, it’s The Day Today which was originally broadcast on TV in the 1990s, 1994 to be exact – yes, that’s probably before some of you were even born. But we don’t care about whether this is old or brand new, it doesn’t matter. I think good comedy always stands the test of time, and The Day Today is no exception. It’s still relevant and funny now just like it was before. And in any case, I think it’s part of the fabric of British culture now, just like many other classic bits of British TV comedy that we all grew up watching on TV.\n\nWhat kind of programme is it?\n\nIt’s a surreal parody of news and current affairs TV programmes. It’s a comedy version of the news.\n\nImagine the news, like the BBC 10 o’clock news, but with everything turned up to 11, everything exaggerated. It’s more dramatic, more pompous, more self-important and much more ridiculous than the real news.\n\nBut The Day Today isn’t just an impressions show of people copying news readers, it had this amazing surreal twist to it, which made it so much more subversive.\n\nThe show made fun specifically of the self-important nature of TV news and used surrealism and absurdity under the guise of a news broadcast.\n\nThe news always presents itself as being very important, very serious, very heavy, completely trustworthy, stern, authoritarian even. These days TV news has softened a bit, but not much. It still has this air of superiority, which I suppose is a necessary part of attempting to convey information in a factual, serious and balanced way. But TV news language – both oral and visual has become a cliché (had become a cliché back in the 90s) which makes it very ripe for making parody comedy.\n\nAn example of real TV news headlines\n\nHere’s an example of the opening of the BBC 9 o’clock news, which was and still is the flagship news programme for the BBC.\n\nListen out for the serious tone of the newsreader Michael Beurk, the important and significant sounding music and also Michael Beurk’s slightly old school pronunciation in places. All of these things went into The Day Today. (News begins at 00:50)\n\nThe difference between the Day Today and other shows which have parodied the news was the surrealism. Basically this meant taking a silly story and dealing with it in the most serious way possible, but there was more to it than that. The phrases used, the images created and the slight sense of twisted insanity create this version of the news that’s part Monty Python, part Peter Cook and part some kind of high tech dystopian vision of the future.\n\nThis is absolutely a show that inspired Charlie Brooker to do work like Black Mirror. In fact, the creator of Black Mirror worked with Chris Morris – the main guy behind The Day Today. So, for me, they come from the same creative community. Clever, satirical, twisted, dark and very funny comedy writing in the UK.\n\nThe Day Today was broadcast at 9pm on BBC2 – the same time as the national news on BBC1. Apparently some people mistakenly watched The Day Today, thinking it was the real news, and believed the stories.\n\nThe parody of news tropes was spot on. It looked, sounded and smelt like news. The opening titles of the show captured that sense of drama, pomposity and urgency that you get from news programmes. The set looked just right. The different characters were weird and bizarre but perfectly captured the sorts of journalists or presenters that you could find on TV.\n\nAlan Partridge made his first TV appearance on this show as the sports reporter with a chip on his shoulder who was always getting things wrong.\n\nThe language is a big part of it. The news readers speak in this kind of news dialect, with a certain kind of intonation, complex sentences that go on too long and mixed metaphors, as we will hear.\n\nWho wrote it and all that stuff?\n\nWikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_Today\n\nExcellent performances by the cast, all of whom have gone on to do other great things.\n\nChris Morris is a talent that people often forget about, but he was fearless, original, very clever, quite ruthless and a bit sick – the perfect recipe for great British comedy. He went on to do another show called Brass Eye, which was similar to The Day Today but more extreme and controversial (and is a potential other episode for LEP), then various weird comedy projects like BlueJam, an ambient mix album with subliminal sketch comedy going on at the same time. Then he became a film director and did the film Four Lions which is about inept terrorists planning an attack in London. The film won various awards, as did The Day Today.\n\nArmando Iannucci went on to make The Thick of It and In The Loop – political satires about life on Whitehall, and then Veep which is the American equivalent following the vice president. He also directed Death of Stalin and has been involved in writing for Alan Partridge and other big projects.\n\nOther notable cast members are Steve Coogan of course who went on to become successful as Alan Partridge but has also starred in a few Hollywood movies and things.\n\nAll the other comedians on the show went on to do more great work.\n\nRebecca Front, Doon Mackichan, Patrick Marber, David Schneider.\n\nOther writers on the show were Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews who went on to create Father Ted and later The IT Crowd and Black Books (just Graham Linehan).\n\nLET’S LISTEN TO SOME CLIPS AND USE THEM TO LEARN ENGLISH\n\nAlright, enough already. Let’s listen to some clips which you can find on YouTube, and which I have posted on the page for this episode, with time codes to help you find the clips.\n\nThere are only 6 episodes of The Day Today but they’re pretty packed with classic stuff.\n\nI’ve been through all 6 episodes and picked out some of my favourite moments to share with you.\n\nThe plan is to play them, then break them down sentence by sentence to make sure you understand them 100% and hopefully, get the jokes, although this show doesn’t really use jokes per se, but in any case the aim is to help you understand and appreciate the humour and learn plenty of English in the process.\n\nAll the episodes are on YouTube so you could check them all out later if you like, or buy the excellent DVD box set from the BBC, which I own and recommend to you. It’s only £5 on Amazon. Other bookshops are available.\n\nI have played some clips of this show before, and explained them for language. You might remember Alan Partridge’s World Cup Countdown or his Sports Roundup, there was Peter O’Hanrahahanrahan interviewing the minister for ships, and I think also we had the interview with the woman raising money by selling jam.\n\nAnyway, let’s get into it.\n\nFirst I want to play you the opening titles of an episode, just for the music really, because it sets the tone. There are a few ridiculous headlines too.\n\nCLIP 1: THE DAY TODAY – OPENING TITLES\n\nWhat are the three stories exactly?\n\nLuke describes the opening titles\n\nThose headlines again\n\nRemember the way grammar changes in headlines.\n\nFIST HEADED MAN DESTROYS CHURCH\n\nPresumably a man with a fist for a head has destroyed a church. You can imagine him headbutting the walls or something. Don’t think about it too much, it’s supposed to be funny to hear such ridiculous things spoken in that voice using that register.\n\nCAR DRIVES PAST WINDOW IN TOWN\n\nThe most boring story. A car drove past a window in a town. It’s accompanied by a video of a car driving past a building.\n\nLEICESTER MAN WINS RIGHT TO EAT SISTER\n\nPresumably a man from Leicester has taken court action to allow him to eat his sister. You could imagine this was a real story if he wanted to ‘wed’ his sister, or cousin, especially if he’s from Leicester, but this is to ‘eat’ his sister.\n\n“Those are the headlines, now fact me till I fart.”\n\nCLIP 2: WAR\n\nAustralia and Hong Kong have signed a treaty to create an amazing free trade agreement which will be very beneficial for both places and marks a new beginning of peace and cooperation between them.\n\nChris Morris interviews the British Minister with special responsibility for the commonwealth (this is the days when HK was still a British dependent territory) and the Australian Foreign Secretary – both men who are responsible for the deal.\n\nThe interview seems to start as a celebration of the new deal, but the newsreader Chris Morris manages to manipulate the two of them into a diplomatic fight which ends in a declaration of war.\n\nThis is a great sketch. The newsreader causes a war in order to be able to cover it in dramatic fashion on his news show. For me it’s about how the media can sometimes drive the agenda through their reporting. The BBC isn’t officially biased. In fact I think most journalists have an honest intention to report on what’s happening, but they’re always going to impose some of their world view on the way they explain stories. But also you get the sense sometimes that some TV producers and presenters are a bit seduced by their own power and end up pushing things in a certain direction under the guise of critical thinking.\n\nAlso, perhaps news programmes thrive on creating drama and reporting on a war is somehow the dream of many broadcast journalists, or at least seems like that because war correspondents have this air of action and adventure which borders on being romantic, and the efficient and lively way that broadcasters deal with stories of war makes it seem like they’re enjoying it somehow. There’s precise technical information, reporters in the middle of the action and loads of dramatic music, graphics and images.\n\nLet’s listen to this sketch, which is about 4mins long.\n\nOver to you\n\nHere are some things to listen out for\n\nHow Chris Morris stokes up tensions and pushes the two diplomats towards war\n\nChris Morris’s confrontational interview style, typical of BBC presenters like Jeremy Paxman, notorious for bullying politicians on TV\n\nThe mixed metaphors and clichés like, “The stretched twig of peace is at melting point” and\n\n“People here are literally bursting with war.”\n\nThe glee with which Chris says “YES, IT’S WAR!”\n\nThe OTT way that the show snaps into action once war has been declared, like they were ready and prepared for this, and as journalists this is what they live for\n\nThe name of the Day Today smart bomb (which I think is an actual bomb fired by The Day\n\nToday, with a camera on it, so they can report from the middle of the fight. The news station have launched their own bombs in this war)\n\nThe clunky way the show goes to the weather, after all that war\n\nI will be going through all of this again after we’ve heard it and I will break it down to the bare bones and will explain language and all that\n\nCLIP 3: Peter O’hanrahahanrahan – Ich Nichten Lichten (Episode 2)\n\nMinisters in Europe have been involved in difficult discussions about quota rates for trade with the US. I expect they’ve been debating what the rates should be, with some ministers disagreeing about the final decision.\n\nEconomics correspondent Peter O’Hanrahahanrahan is in Brussels because he says he’s spoken to the German minister and knows how he feels about the decision.\n\nPeter O Hanrahahanrahan’s name is a joke on a real correspondent called Brian Hanrahan (an irish name I think) who actually used to call our house sometimes to speak to my dad (who used to be a BBC news man). Michael Beurk also came round sometimes. He was one of the presenters of the 9 o’clock news who is parodied by Chris Morris on The Day Today. In fact, I feel like I grew up in a news household because my dad often reviewed videos of presenters, we always watched the news, there were BBC pens and mugs all around the house and we sometimes met BBC TV presenters and news readers. I never met Alan Partridge though.\n\nPeter O’Hanrahahanrahan is incompetent, stupid and also petulant (disobeys orders and lies, childishly). It turns out that Peter hasn’t spoken to the German minister and just stayed in his hotel room the whole time. He’s making up the information and can’t even speak German.\n\nListen out for\n\nThe way Chris Morris is sceptical about what Peter is saying, and starts to question his story subtly, before full-on bullying him and telling him off like a naughty schoolboy\n\nPeter’s pathetic attempt to speak German, clearly pretending that he knows the language and actually spoke to the German minister, when he doesn’t and didn’t\n\nHow Peter finally admits that he doesn’t actually know what happened and didn’t speak to the minister at all, like a teenager admitting that he’s lying\n\nPeter O Hanrahahanrahan – Ich nichten lichten (starts at 19m40sec)\n\nCLIP 4: SOME KIND OF DRUBBING INCIDENT (Episode 3\n\nIn this one we start with a sports report from Alan Partridge but it gets interrupted with the news that The Queen and the Prime Minister have had a fight. We then follow the story and learn that during their weekly meeting, the PM (John Major) punched The Queen. This sounds shocking of course, especially now that The Queen is elderly, but that’s not the point.\n\nInstead the show is mocking the way the news would deal with a constitutional crisis, springing into action in order to cover the crisis in full detail. It’s also just ridiculous to imagine The Queen having a brawl with anyone.\n\nListen out for\n\nThe report from Jennifer Gumpets in front of Buckingham Palace. This report is so realistic.\n\nThere isn’t much comedy in it beyond the bizarreness of the story. It’s just a perfect little parody of a report from a correspondent.\n\n“And as a result of that broadcast the crisis has deepened dramatically” The news actually makes the situation worse by broadcasting footage of the fight, and then starts reporting on that too.\n\nSpartacus Mills (history expert) – “Can you sum it up in a word? No. A sound?” What sound does Spartacus use to sum up the situation?\n\nThe special broadcast which was pre-recorded and designed to be played at times of crisis. It’s basically a way to say “This is Britain, and everything is all right. It’s ok. It’s fine.” and it’s filled with proud patriotic sentiments. The irony is that this kind of thing is either a) needed now in order to make British people feel that everything’s fine or b) the sort of thing used by the Leave campaign to convince people to vote Brexit.\n\nWhat’s the solution to the crisis which has been agreed by both sides?\n\nClips start at 5:38 & 19:40/21:10\n\nThe PM was seen to leave hurriedly after half and hour"
