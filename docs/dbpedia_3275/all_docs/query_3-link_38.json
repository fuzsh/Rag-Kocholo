I didn't think a whole lot about the preview. Some pretty funny ideas, but without a Morris or a Coogan for a front man it all just looked like a weak Brass Eye imitation.\n\nYeah i know what you mean but i thought Armando did a good job when he presented the armistice. Maybe he isn't as good a performer but I think he's a better writer than coogan or morris.\n\nSpam Javelin said:\n\nHmmm. I didn't think a whole lot about the preview.

The stuff he did on the Armistice was ridiculously funny.\n\nI'm not saying that he's not a great writer and producer, it's just that from the clips I saw it seemed that the brass eye/day today format was being used and none of the actors seemed to have the ability to pull the material off.\n\nI'm not sure that he appears in the show, he just does some voice overs. Which is good, as he doesn't make that seemless leap from backroom/radio to tv like contemporaries such as Ryan Tubridy have.\n\nProve me wrong Armando, prove me wrong.\n\nI've no doubt that it'll be way better than most other comedys on tv though, apart from Two Lagers & a Packet of Crisps.\n\nThe preview didn't have the epiphiny-type effect that The Day Today did when I first saw it, all those years ago. Nonetheless, I will be tuning in to this.\n\nI see spammo's point though\n\nseanc said:\n\nThe preview didn't have the epiphiny-type effect that The Day Today did when I first saw it, all those years ago.\n\nyou would have been 10 years old."
