        "text": "Original air date: October 7, 1994\n\nDirector: Dominic Bristocke\n\nWriters: Armando Iannucci, Steve Coogan, and Patrick Marber\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nThis is probably the best episode of the series. It’s just fantastic. Alan hosts his show in Paris, with a co-host in Nina Vanier (Melanie Hudson), a woman he frequently offends with his stereotyping of the French people.\n\nThe show is under the guise of bringing the two countries closer together, but of course we get just the opposite.\n\nAlan offends his first guest, a chef, by not only the way he eats his food, but the questions he asks, comparing him to a popular steakhouse.\n\nHe does his “Knowing me, Alan Partridge, knowing you, another Alan Partridge” with a Frenchman who doesn’t understand a word he’s saying (he even gifts him a painting of an English bulldog with frog legs, which is great).\n\nBut the real beauty starts when he has eccentric English fashion designer Yvonne Boyd (Rebecca Front) on.\n\nHe annoys her by asking if she does pantomime, and he’s just not into her postmodern fashion sense, of course. And while to a certain extent, he has a point, he goes way too far.\n\nHe does, of course, have his own montage of his own personal fashion style, which he calls “sports casual.”\n\nThis montage alone has some incredible lines, such as his “It’s a look that says ‘I’m in control of my vehicle.’” It’s just great.\n\nAnd then, of course, he freaks out and accuses Yvonne’s models of not having dignity, further embarrassing himself by demonstrating a walk with dignity himself.\n\nOf course there’s also Cirque des Clowns, a raunchy clown troupe that offends Alan almost immediately. And then keeps offending him as they make fun of him.\n\nThis is great, too, with David Schneider doing a great job as the leader of the troupe.\n\nAnd it all culminates in a fantastic sequence in which Alan fires Glenn Ponder after he not only didn’t call Alan to tell him they were going to the Folies Bergere the night before, but cracking a joke that they had a strict dress code and didn’t allow in “sports casual.”\n\nIt’s wall to wall laughter, and one of the biggest laughs comes at the end with Alan’s pre-scripted line of how he feels this has made the two countries grow closer together. Just a masterpiece of comedy all around."
