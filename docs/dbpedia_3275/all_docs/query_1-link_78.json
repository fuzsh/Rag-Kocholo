        "text": "I've been meaning to watch these two Steve Coogan shows, in which he plays fictional talk show host and quasi-celebrity Alan Partridge, for quite a while now. They're so legendary that I was afraid they wouldn't live up to the hype. Knowing Me, Knowing You was a bit of a disappointment, actually. It takes the format of an incredibly inane fictional talk show - the first that Alan Partridge has been given to host. In every episode he usually offends his guests and occasionally ruins their lives. The jokes are a little too easy and follow the same format again and again. Alan says something stupid, the guest is put off, etc., etc.\n\nI'm Alan Partridge is very different. It's done in a sort of mockumentary style and takes place after Alan's talk show was canceled and his wife kicked him out of his house. He now lives in a travel lodge halfway between London and Norwich (Norwich is where he hosts an Extremely early morning radio show) and keeps trying to get back on the BBC somehow. While he still annoys everyone around him, Alan seems much more realistic in this show, and at the same time, a lot weirder. In Knowing Me, Knowing You he was just an asshole, in I'm Alan Partridge he's down on his luck and full of eccentricities. One of my favorite moments is when he asks a woman out on a date and his romantic location of choice is the local owl sanctuary. There's another great episode when he's extremely bored and decides to walk to a local gas station and buy 30 bottles of windshield washer fluid to pass the time. All in all, it's a pretty cute show."
