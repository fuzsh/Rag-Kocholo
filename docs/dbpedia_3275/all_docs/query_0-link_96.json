        "text": "He’s been involved in some of the funniest and most ground-breaking comedies of the last 20 years, and lately Armando Iannucci even exported his absurd, foul-mouthed and scathingly satirical sense of humour across the Atlantic .\n\nAs he turns 50, here’s an arbitrary number of clips to remind us of why he continues to be a very funny (middle-aged) man.\n\nBe warned, there are a few naughty words in the clips below - if that kind of thing offends you.\n\nThe Day Today – War\n\nThis groundbreaking news spoof, fronted by a monstrously Paxman-esque Chris Morris, peaked with a superb passage in which Morris plays off a pair of politicians against each other from an innocuous trade agreement to the point of armed conflict (“What are you going to do about it? Let me give you a hint – BANG!”)\n\nWar is duly declared, and the thrill with which the Day Today team throw themselves into it, complete with hero-reporter footage from “Donald Bethlehem on the Australio-Hong Kong border”, superbly pricks the bubble of self-importance that 90% of such news reporting continues to inhabit.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge – Partridge Over Britain\n\nA graduate from the Sports Desk of the above show, Coogan’s jumper-clad icon-in-waiting came of age in this spoof chat show. But Iannucci, Coogan and co weren’t just targeting housewives’ choice TV.\n\nThe format gave them a chance to poke fun at any number of common figures from public life, and in this by-election debate, chaired with magnificent ignorance by AP, they skewered idiot comedy candidates and pompous government stooges as well as our hero’s many shortcomings as a host.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge – The Colour Of Alan\n\nAs co-writer and creator, Iannucci cemented a true comedy icon in Steve Coogan’s waving-yet-drowning chat show host, who we later grew to love as he strove to find a way back into television while working the graveyard shift on local radio.\n\nThese clips see Alan impaling his foot on a spike while trying to climb some railings, but he soldiers on (“Lynn, some of these people have come from Stoke”), resulting in a presentation for Dante Fireplaces that is, in many different ways, painful.\n\nAnd bloody funny.\n\nTime Trumpet – The War On Terror\n\nAlthough it’s less well known than a lot of his other work, this talking-head nostalgia show set in 2031 is full of vintage Iannucci silliness.\n\nThis look at the post 9/11 climate of fear is a priceless send up of the floundering attempts to foil terrorism by ludicrous blanket clampdowns (“We banned rucksacks… then we decided to ban all forms of transport”).\n\nThe aged celebrity commentators are particularly superb (Jamie Oliver, David Beckham).\n\nThe Thick Of It – Tim In Ruislip\n\nAlthough Iannucci once described his political sitcom The Thick Of It as Yes Minister meets Larry Sanders, neither of those series had a character quite as magnetically, charismatically, coruscatingly foul as Malcolm Tucker.\n\nIn this clip, the government ‘enforcer’ is enraged (as is his natural resting state) at a radio producer allowing a listener’s unfavourable text to be read out to the minister on air. He duly vows not only to destroy the producer’s career, but to “go to f***ing Ruislip and snap the thumb and forefinger of every single person I see who I think resembles the kind of w***** that’d be walking around in this day and f***ing age with a name like f***ing Tim”.\n\nIn The Loop – the kids’ room\n\nOne of Iannucci’s great strengths is comparing and contrasting the globe-spinningly important decisions politicians have to make with the ridiculous, flawed human beings making them.\n\nIn this scene from the movie spin-off from The Thick Of It, the late James Gandolfini is Lieutenant General George Miller, collared by the secretary of state at a drinks party to discuss troop numbers for the forthcoming military intervention.\n\nWith nowhere private to chat, they retreat to a child’s bedroom, where Gandolfini is reduced to calculating the figures on a talking toddlers’ computer.\n\nStewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle – Stewart v Armando: Toilet Books\n\nAlthough by his own admission ranking as “the 41st greatest stand-up comedian of all time”, Lee was hardly the biggest name in comedy at the time of this series of stand-up shows.\n\nHowever, his career underwent a renaissance partly due to these curiously hypnotic slices of withering, tinder-dry wit, interspersed with a highly agreeable tendency to rip household names to pieces out of “professional and sexual jealousy”.\n\nRussell Brand, Dan Brown, Adrian Chiles, Chris Moyles and of course, So Solid Crew are his targets in the first screened episode, and in the BBC’s red button footage he was grilled about his motivations by producer Iannucci, adding “something of no value”, according to Lee, but plenty of laughs nonetheless\n\nVeep – “You’re a meme, ma’am”\n\nThere are touches of the sneering contempt, impotent rage and inventive profanity witnessed in previous Iannucci characters when Julia-Louis Dreyfus’s vice-president deals incredulously with what she sees as the incompetent fools surrounding her.\n\nIn this clip from the HBO show’s first series the less-than-internet-savvy protagonist is told that a picture of her has gone viral, photoshopped onto a series of hilarious images."
