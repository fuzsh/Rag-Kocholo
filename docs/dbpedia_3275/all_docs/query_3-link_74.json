        "text": "No other show quite compares to Succession.\n\nThe prestige HBO dramedy about a toxic family-run media and entertainment conglomerate has gained a cult following since it premiered in 2018.\n\nWith its third season coming to an exhilarating close, you'd be forgiven for being at a loss on how to fill the Waystar RoyCo-shaped hole in your heart.\n\nSure, there are plenty of shows out there about rich people being snarky to each other (Billions, Dynasty), but those trimmings are all secondary to what makes Succession so addictive.\n\nCreated by Jesse Armstrong, at the core of Succession is a group of \"scruffy, shambolic British comedy writers\" who are responsible for a slew of other razor-sharp satires featuring characters just as compelling who spit insults even more cutting.\n\nSuccession will be getting a fourth season (\"good tweet!\") but filming won't begin until at least June 2022 (\"bad tweet!\"), so instead of re-watching every episode, check out these other titles from the same talented writers.\n\nThe Thick of It (2005-2012)\n\nNumber of seasons: 4\n\nThe show, in one sentence: Created by Armando Iannucci, The Thick of It is a dark comedy about the workings of Westminster and centres around the fictional Department of Social Affairs and its incompetent staff.\n\nWhat happens in the pilot: Newly installed Secretary for Social Affairs Hugh Abbott hopes to make his mark on the department with the announcement of an anti-benefit fraud task force – the Snooper Force. But a miscommunication with the Prime Minister forces the department to kill the proposal on the way to the press conference, leading Hugh and his staffers to scramble for a new idea in the back of a cab.\n\nWhy you'll like it: If you think Logan Roy's tirades are iconic, you're yet to endure The Malcolm Tucker Experience. The foul-mouthed director of communications strikes fear into the hearts of ministers, staffers and journalists alike with his verbal takedowns, and makes a round of 'boar on the floor' seem preferable.\n\nA cracking quote: \"He's so dense that light bends around him.\"\n\nFun fact: Staff writer Tony Roche is credited with inventing the phrase 'omnishambles' (meaning a situation which is shambolic from every possible angle), which was named Word of the Year by the Oxford English Dictionary in 2012.\n\nWhere to watch it: Stan\n\nVeep (2012-2019)\n\nFollowing the success of The Thick of It, creator Armando Iannucci adapted the idea for American audiences and developed Veep with HBO. The first four seasons featured an entirely British writing staff, including The Thick of It alum Jesse Armstrong, Georgia Pritchett and Tony Roche.\n\nNumber of seasons: 7\n\nThe show, in one sentence: She's one heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the free world, but Selina Meyer finds that being Vice-President of the United States is nothing like she hoped and everything she was warned about.\n\nWhat happens in the pilot? Selina hopes to define her legacy with the Clean Jobs Initiative and starts by spruiking cutlery made of cornstarch (which melts into her coffee in one scene), but a series of mishaps quickly throws her plans awry.\n\nWhy you'll like it: Succession and Veep share that ingrained feeling of being the lowest rung on a very high ladder. Both Selina and Shiv navigate male-dominated spheres in roles they're aware are mostly symbolic and endure little respect but plenty of scrutiny – making you root for them all the more.\n\nA cracking quote: \"If men got pregnant, you could get an abortion at an ATM.\"\n\nFun fact: In 2016, then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull drew parallels with the show when he unwittingly borrowed Selina Meyer's campaign slogan – \"continuity with change\" – when he said \"the bottom line is there is continuity and there is change.\" Veep writer Simon Blackwell said Selina's line was \"the most meaningless election slogan we could think of.\"\n\nWhere to watch it: Binge\n\nThe Shrink Next Door (2021)\n\nWith writing credits on Succession, The Thick of It and Veep, Georgia Pritchett developed the mini-series The Shrink Next Door. The show is based on the podcast of the same name, and stars Will Ferrell, who's an executive producer on Succession.\n\nNumber of seasons: 1\n\nThe show, in one sentence: A charismatic psychiatrist inserts himself a little too much into one of his patients' lives in this dark comedy about exploitation and manipulation – made only more sinister when you discover it's based on a true story.\n\nWhat happens in the pilot? A midlife crisis sees an anxious Marty Markowitz finally attend therapy sessions with Dr Ike Herschkopf, who quickly ropes Marty into his web of lies and deceit.\n\nWhy you'll like it: It's easy to label the characters in Succession as just straight-up terrible people. But one of the reasons we can't look away from their cutthroat world is because the show humanises these morally dubious people. The Shrink Next Door has this same tone but in reverse. Just like Marty, we get swept up by Dr Ike, only to witness his behaviour get more unethical over time.\n\nWhere to watch it: Apple TV+\n\nPeep Show (2003-2015)\n\nLong before Succession, Jesse Armstrong created Peep Show with Sam Bain in 2003. Despite never achieving high viewing figures during its original run, it grew a cult-following and became Channel 4's longest-running comedy before wrapping up in 2015.\n\nNumber of seasons: 9\n\nThe show, in a sentence: Peep Show follows the lives of two dysfunctional, cynical best friends who share a flat in South London.\n\nWhat happens in the pilot? We meet Mark, a socially awkward and despondent loan manager who is bullied by children on the street, and Jeremy, an unemployed musician who lives in Mark's spare room. Despite being friends, both men are keen on their next-door neighbour Toni and don't hesitate to make the other look bad.\n\nWhy you'll like it: If you've ever wished Tom and Greg could get their own show, you're somewhat in luck. While Peep Show's Mark and Jeremy couldn't be further from the 1 per cent of society Succession is based on; they're both underdogs who share a similar push and pull dynamic that's full of cringe-worthy moments – just with slightly more principles and less human furniture.\n\nFun fact: Peep Show gets its name from its unconventional 'point of view' shooting style which was unique at the time, but both Armstrong and Bain said it alienated a large part of their audience and prevented the show from becoming mainstream. But almost 20 years later, Succession shares that similar unstable cinematography, giving the audience a fly-on-the-wall insight, which only adds to its storytelling.\n\nA cracking quote: \"Why shouldn't I go for Toni? So she scares me. You can have a good relationship with someone who scares you. Look at me and Dad.\"\n\nWhere to watch it: ABC iview and Stan\n\nWhat about some movies?\n\nIf you're not in the mood to start a whole new series and are looking for a more 'one and done' affair, check out the back catalogue of Adam McKay. He directed Succession's pilot episode and helped establish its handheld cinematography style which adds to the show's fast-paced, turbulent world.\n\nDon't Look Up (2021) – Starring half of Hollywood including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett and Jonah Hill (and more!), two low-level astronomers must go on a giant media tour to warn mankind of an approaching comet that will destroy planet Earth. In cinemas now.\n\nVice (2018) – The story of Dick Cheney, who quietly wielded immense power as vice-president to George W Bush, reshaping the country and the globe in ways that we still feel today. Available to rent on: iTunes\n\nThe Big Short (2015) – A group of investors bet against the US mortgage market. Plus, it features Succession's Jeremy Strong! Where to watch it: Netflix\n\nAnd if you're looking for something lighter starring The Shrink Next Door's Will Ferrell, Adam McKay also directed Step Brothers, The Other Guys, and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\n\nBut I already miss the Roys!\n\nIf you're looking for even more Jeremy Strong, check out Trial of the Chicago 7 on Netflix.\n\nAnd if you're just as obsessed with Cousin Greg as I am, Nicholas Braun is in the new film Zola which is playing at selected cinemas.\n\nUntil Succession returns, we'll be binge-watching all three seasons and daydreaming about a trip to Italy."
