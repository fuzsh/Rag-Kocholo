        "text": "Steve Coogan portrays talk-show host Alan Partridge in all six episodes from this original BBC Radio series. Alan's celebrity guests include child prodigy Simon Fisher, who doesn't know what's hit him, and lady hypnotist Janey Katz, who taps into Alan's childhood phobias. Comedian Steve Thompson rubs Alan the wrong way with an impression that's too close to home, while ex-hostage Chris Lester is introduced to a surprise guest—the man he was chained to for years. Also starring Doon MacKichan, Rebecca Front, David Schneider and Patrick Marber.\n\nJournalist, presenter, broadcaster, husband, father, vigorous all-rounder – Alan Partridge – a man with a fascinating past and an amazing future. Gregarious and popular, yet Alan’s never happier than when relaxing in his own five-bedroom, south-built house with three acres of land and access to a private stream. But who is this mysterious enigma?\n\nAlan Gordon Partridge is the best – and best-loved – radio presenter in the region. Born into a changing world of rationing, Teddy Boys, apes in space and the launch of ITV, Alan’s broadcasting career began as chief DJ of Radio Smile at St. Luke’s Hospital in Norwich. After replacing Peter Flint as the presenter of Scout About, he entered the top 8 of BBC sports presenters.\n\nBut Alan’s big break came with his primetime BBC chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You. Sadly, the show battled against poor scheduling, having been put up against News at Ten, then in its heyday. Due to declining ratings, a single catastrophic hitch (the killing of a guest on air) and the dumbing down of network TV, Alan’s show was cancelled. Not to be dissuaded, he embraced this opportunity to wind up his production company, leave London and fulfil a lifelong ambition to return to his roots in local radio.\n\n------\n\nAlan Gordon Partridge is a fictional radio and television presenter portrayed by English comedian Steve Coogan and invented by Coogan, Armando Iannucci, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring for the BBC Radio 4 programme 'On The Hour.' A parody of both sports commentators and chat show presenters, among others, the character has appeared in two radio series, three television series and numerous TV and radio specials, including appearances on BBC's Comic Relief, which have followed the rise and fall of his career. He returned to television in 'Alan Partridge - Welcome to the Places of My Life,' which aired on Sky Atlantic in June 2012."
