        "text": "Back to Channel 4, for some episodes of The Armando Iannucci Shows. Departing from the current affairs core of shows like The Day Today and The Saturday Night Armistice, these were more whimsical, much more like Alexei Sayle’s shows in tone. Like the first sketch of two house buyers, and everything in the kitchen is made of paper.\n\nPaying off with a brilliant punchline. “Bloody kids!”\n\nA terrorist phones in a coded warning to a television station, but they don’t think it’s really what they’re looking for. When they finally agree to put Ant & Dec first, the TV people (including Stephen Mangan there) dance around singing “We’re so good at telly.” Which is a scene I think about a lot whenever I see stupid ideas for TV shows.\n\nAn old man reminisces about the olden days, when the Internet was in black & white and only on for three hours a day. “We used to log into Let’sBuyIt.com and order a gas mask and a pound of tripe.”\n\nJesus returns to cure some low level health niggles. There’s Tony Gardner in the cast.\n\nPaying for a car service. “It’s come up on your card. You’re a twat.” A lot of these sketches hit close to home for me.\n\nIn the next episode, I like the Emergency Battenberg.\n\nThe Busby Berkeley dance number with dead people in heaven is a little macabre.\n\nGuest appearance from Hale and Pace running a shoe shop.\n\nIn the next episode, two men from Television want to make a reality TV show about Buddhist monks. “I ask you to trust us. We’re from Television.” And they do an almost imperceptible dance.\n\nThe popular priest sketch is quite creepy.\n\nPearson’s Transglobal Insurance have invested £750m in their new internet strategy. “It’s very informal.”\n\nThere’s a deeply unpleasant sketch about domestic violence and the Tooth Fairy (played by David Schneider).\n\nIn the next episode, Racist Police Horses does that thing that they did in The Young Ones – have obviously ironic racism, but because you’re actually using racist slurs, it undercuts the comedy and is actually slightly harmful, although it’s hard to imagine kids in the playground watching this show then repeating the slurs the next day, as happened with The Young Ones.\n\nArmando delivers some jokes in the style of a business presentation. “There, the highly successful logo of the Nazi Party.”\n\nIn the next episode, which is not the advertised programme according to the announcer, a wheelchair user is made head of Railtrack, and has his revenge on inaccessible railway stations by putting steps on the train tracks.\n\nTime Management for the Dying.\n\nThe final episode features a high speed chase with two standard lamps.\n\n“Swearing on the lawn.”\n\nColin Stinson and Ed Winchester (Jeff Harding) as US Generals.\n\nAfter this, there’s an episode of Pornography: A Secret History Of Civilisation. This one looks at the 70s, when Video started to become important. Constance Penley calls the 70s ‘The Golden Era’ of porn films.\n\nI wonder if this was actually videotape, or whether it was just an audio tape add-on to a TV? The programme implies that it was the RCA Selectavision system, that never made it to markey.\n\nMark Kearns’ job is to watch porn.\n\nLinda and Eddy De Roo’s porn film business (operated ‘out of the back of their restaurant’) was affected by video. “My entire life was film and it was disappearing.” You’d think he was Fellini. He probably thought he was Fellini. Fellati? Video has “never replaced the love and the companionship that film had.” He’s the porn version of Christopher Nolan. I bet he never lets anyone sit down on his sets either.\n\nThe state of this guy. Honestly.\n\n“I don’t think anybody in the business wanted to shoot direct to video.”\n\nI like this RCA Camcorder commercial, which has a voiceover from Patrick Stewart.\n\nThey visit the Cannes Film Festival where a company is promoting ‘The Uranus Experiment’ ‘using special effects worthy of a Hollywood Blockbuster’.\n\nEuropean porn company Private branched out into energy drinks. No, really. “We stand for a lifestyle.”\n\nCamille Paglia on video porn: “Even the remote control, with its fetishistic and phallic quality has a kind of organic element to it that was not present in the purely visual activity of watching television.” She also likens a man using the remote to find a particular scene as like hunter-gatherers.\n\nHenry Jenkins: “I think there’s something very lyrical about moving frame by frame through a pornographic sequence” is a line he first used on his wife when she caught him wanking over Electric Blue.\n\nFilm Professor Jay Lorenz talks about ‘The dismemberment of narrative’. Or is it memberment replacing narrative?\n\nUgly George would walk around the city with a shoulder mounted video rig, and persuade women to strip off on camera.\n\nJohn Stagliano went by the name ‘Buttman’, working in the same style as Ugly George. Constance Penley describes him as ‘The Woody Allen of adult film making’. He doesn’t like that comparison because Woody Allen is short and whines a lot.\n\nThe programme can’t even spell the name ‘Canon’ correctly.\n\nTim Farrell runs a company the puts out amateur video.\n\nMatt Zane: “I am the physical manifestation of lust.”\n\nWhat a bunch of wankers.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of an episode of Action, in which Sandra Bullock punches Jay Mohr in the face. Give the audience what they want, I say. In a callback to the previous programme, she’s angry about a video, ‘Sandra Buttock stars in While You Were Sleeping… On My Face’. Which is funny.\n\nThe tape ends shortly into this programme.\n\nIn the ad breaks, there was this gem from Heineken, a follow-up from a previous ad where Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee are singing ‘Close to You’ and the caption says ‘We’ll keep playing this ad until our sales improve’. Here’s the sequel, also featuring Peter Stringfellow, Vanessa Feltz, Jimmy Hill, that posh woman who turned up in Brass Eye, a dark-haired woman who doesn’t get a close-up and I don’t recognise, and… Jimmy Savile. (Although it might be a Savile lookalike.)\n\nAdverts:"
