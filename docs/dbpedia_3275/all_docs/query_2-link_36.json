Coogan stars as Alan Partridge, a tactless and inept broadcaster who has been left by his wife and dropped by the BBC.\n\nTwo series of six episodes each were broadcast five years apart. Series 1 was released in late 1997, while a second series followed in 2002,[1] with Partridge now living in a static caravan after recovering from an off-screen mental breakdown.[2][3] Iannucci said the writers used the sitcom as \"a kind of social X-ray of male middle-aged Middle England\".[1]"
