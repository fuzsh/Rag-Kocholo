        "text": "Dr Alan Gordon Partridge, aka Alan Partridge: TV presenter, radio broadcaster, author, podcast host and (as of his 2022 live tour, Strategem) lifestyle guru. He is the king of cringe comedy, a man who is so detestable and self-serving that he’s wormed his way, somehow, into the nation’s hearts.\n\nCreated by The Thick of It and Veep writer Armando Iannucci alongside Steve Coogan, who plays the character, Partridge’s first appearance was on the radio in 1991, introduced as a (very rubbish) sports presenter on BBC Radio 4’s spoof news bulletin On the Hour. But most of us know him as a TV presenter, whether he’s hosting his own chat show, appearing as a sitcom star or presenting a parody of The One Show.\n\nNow, the BBC has announced that Partridge will soon be returning to television in a brand new mockumentary. And Did Those Feet… with Alan Partridge will follow the presenter as he sets out to try to re-find the happiness his hometown of Norwich used to give him, after spending a year working in Saudi Arabia. I’m very much looking forward to catching up with him.\n\nHere are 10 of Partridge’s best appearances to watch, read, listen to and wince at in anticipation of his return:\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge\n\nThe first time Partridge struck out on his own was with a chat show. The set was modelled on a “high-end hotel”, complete with a fountain (a “chat show first”, apparently), and the live band only played Abba songs, mostly to facilitate Partridge’s catchphrase “Aha!”.\n\nGuests included jockeys, members of the Royal Family and child prodigies, but it all ended in tears when Partridge accidentally shot one of his interviewees. It put an early end to his TV career but set up the character for the perfect redemption arc. Streaming on Now\n\nI’m Alan Partridge\n\nWe next saw Partridge in 1997 as the subject of a hilarious but also rather desperate sitcom. After being dropped by the BBC and enduring a messy divorce, Partridge was living in a sad roadside hotel (and later a caravan) and being more hindered than helped by his harried assistant Lynn (Felicity Montagu). However, he had managed to wheedle his way back into a media job, presenting a local radio show which – according to Partridge – has “the largest audience share for a digital channel at that time of day in the Norfolk area”. Streaming on Now and Britbox\n\nAlan Partridge’s Mid Morning Matters\n\nAside from a few minor TV appearances (including a mockumentary on his life and career, Anglian Lives: Alan Partridge) and a tour, Partridge was put to rest for years. He returned in 2010 as host of radio show Mid Morning Matters on fictional station North Norfolk Digital alongside his new sideskick Simon (the brilliant Tim Key). Filmed from the perspective of a webcam on their desk, nothing much really happens in on Mid Morning Matters, the joy coming not from watching Partridge’s life fall apart, but from him failing to relate to his listeners and sharing his (often rather dodgy) opinions. Streaming on Now\n\nI, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan\n\nReading Partridge’s first autobiography is fun, but I recommend listening to the audiobook (read by Coogan, of course) to get the full cringeworthy effect. His memoir is an exercise in hyperbole and exaggeration, with every childhood memory being spun into some sort of trauma that shaped Partridge as the man he is today. I also recommend seeking out clips of Partridge’s promotional tour for the book, which includes a toe-curling appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show. Published by HarperCollins\n\nAlan Partridge: Alpha Papa\n\nAn action film starring Alan Partridge shouldn’t work, but Alpha Papa treads the line between Hollywood blockbuster and parochial comedy perfectly. Still presenting his North Norfolk Digital show, things go awry when the building is stormed by a disgruntled colleague who is panicked that he’ll lose his job when the station is sold. Partridge finds himself negotiating between the assailant and the police, finding that he quite likes the resurgence of public attention he’s getting as a byproduct. Of course, he eventually uses his new fame to relaunch his TV career. Available to buy on Prime Video and streaming on ITVX Premium\n\nAlan Partridge: Nomad\n\nReading the inner workings of Partridge’s brain – here written by Coogan, Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and Steve Coogan – is quite different from hearing his resulting thoughts on TV or the radio. In Nomad, (which he suggests may be Scottish for “not mad”), the presenter chronicles his journey through Britain, retracing his father’s steps from his hometown of Norwich to a nuclear reactor in Dungeness. Unsurprisingly it’s all revealed as a shameless attempt to have his walk turned into a TV series and Partridge spends most of his time disparaging the work of other travelogue hosts (though he’s rather confused by his feelings for Julia Bradbury, who he hates and fancies in equal measure). Published by Trapeze\n\nThis Time with Alan Partridge\n\nPerhaps my favourite Partridge series ever sees the presenter land his dream job as host of a teatime magazine series back on the BBC. Or more accurately, and much to his chagrin, co-host – he’s made to share the couch with bright young thing Jennie Gresham (Susannah Fielding) – and he’s also only been hired to fill in for a beloved presenter who has fallen ill. Still, he takes on the role with gusto, presenting segments on everything from the SAS to lookalikes to the Me Too movement (yes, it’s as excruciating as it sounds). Streaming on BBC iPlayer\n\nFrom the Oasthouse\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Alan Partridge ventured into podcasting. From the Oasthouse sees Partridge open the door – and windows – to his private life (“within reason”). There’s been three series so far, with episodes covering the highs and lows of becoming a grandfather, his many failed relationships and, most interestingly (read: terrifyingly funny), his take on the raging culture wars. Of course James Bond can be played by a black actor, he argues – as long as there’s another white spy working alongside him! It’s a brilliant skewering of the nonsense so often spewed by his real-life media counterparts and a delicious, subtle takedown of people who may well share Partridge’s ridiculous views. Available on Audible\n\nStrategem\n\nAfter three decades in the public eye, Partridge thought it was time to share his secret to success. So, he created a lifestyle strategy and – decked in an all-white outfit he says was inspired by “Jesus if he was Steve Jobs” – toured it around the country’s biggest arenas. There’s Hamilton-inspired rapping, a journey through time, a meditation session and even a cameo from the one and only Lynn. Partridge works just as well in theatre mode as he does on TV and radio – there’s just about enough room on stage for him, a couple of dancers, and his massive ego.
