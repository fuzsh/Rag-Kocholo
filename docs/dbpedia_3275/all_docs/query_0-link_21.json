So get ready to enter the chat-o-sphere as Alan Partridge tries to prove that his show's not moribund, meets another Alan Partridge and delves into Alan's Big Pocket. You'll be absolutely chattered as Alan loses patience with guests Keith Hunt (Am I Right? You're Not Wrong!), punk singer Shona McGough, Cheeky Monkey and the Linford Christie of great-grandmothers. But will Roger Moore arrive before the end of the show?"
