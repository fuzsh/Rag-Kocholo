        "text": "I saw Steve Coogan once, walking down the street in Hove, near Brighton, England. I screamed at him: “Ah ha!” He shouted it back to me and then hurried on his way, having been in that situation probably a thousand times, knowing full well that fans have the potential to be complete mentalists if encouraged. I’ve never suffered from blatant celebritism, but when it comes to Steve Coogan, I’m very fond indeed. I’ve followed his career since he first appeared on British television screens, and in my opinion, he is the most talented British comedian of his generation, much like his idol Peter Sellers was.\n\nTo mark the arrival of Coogan’s latest film in theatres this Friday, Michael Winterbottom’s The Trip, we’ve gone a little over-the-top at the Standard and compiled our favourite bits from Steve’s career. We’re afraid it doesn’t include any of his American films. Coogan’s British characters are gloriously flawed losers who never do get it right, something we Brits enjoy immensely; alternately, Americans seem to prefer the down-on-his-luck, comeback-kid comedic type who eventually does get it right. How lame — lucky for Hollywood it has Will Ferrell for that.\n\nThe Day Today: When enfant terrible Chris Morris and cutting edge BBC comedy producer Armando Iannucci created the Radio 4 news satire On the Hour in 1991, Coogan was brought on board to play a sports desk reporter by the name of Alan Partridge. The radio program was quickly developed into a BBC television series called The Day Today and Alan became the most popular character on the show, offering Coogan the opportunity he’d been waiting for.\n\nCoogan’s Run: In 1995 Steve created a portfolio of characters for this six-part television series. Some of them were based on his stand-up routines and expanded for the camera.\n\nPaul Calf’s Video Diary: Paul Calf was originally named “Duncan Disorderly” in Coogan’s early stand-up routines. If you’ve seen the above link, you know he is a drunk, student-hating mullet-wearing oaf, who lives at home along with his sister Pauline. This became one of Coogan’s best loved characters in the UK because Brits enjoy laughing at anyone who is even more pissed and down on their luck than they are. Paul’s wedding video, Three Fights, Two Weddings and a Funeral, is remains as hilarious as the first time I saw it way back when.\n\nTony Ferrino: This stuck-in-the-’70s Portuguese singer had a couple of outings and TV movies but never lasted in audience’s minds as one of Coogan’s best. Still, there are some choice moments and great songs.\n\nKnowing Me Knowing You: Aired in 1994, Alan Partridge returns with a BBC chat show of his own. Named after the ABBA song and with the catchphrase “Ah ha!”, the series left room for Coogan to further develop this tragic, socially inadequate, loveable idiot. The series ended with Alan shooting one of his guests and the cancellation of his contract with the BBC.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge: Alan was revived again for this 1997 series, now divorced from his wife and his children (Fernando and Denise). Having fallen from television grace, he’s returned to his radio roots with the 4 – 7 am hosting slot on Radio Norwich, dubbed Up With the Partridge. He is also living in a travel tavern (roadside budget hotel), which he chooses because it is “equidistant between London and Norwich”.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge (Series II): Alan returned in 2002, our anti-hero having earned his way to the “third best slot on Radio Norwich”, presenting Norfolk Nights. He lives in a trailer with his a thickly-accented mail order Ukrainian girlfriend, has beaten his addiction to chocolate, and completed his autobiography, Bouncing Back.\n\n24 Hour Party People: In 2002 Coogan collaborated for the first time with director Michael Winterbottom, playing journalist and former Manchester music mogul Tony Wilson of Factory Records. This performance edged Coogan towards Hollywood, where his work was still largely unknown, but he made important friends with admirers such as Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The blonde Texan ended up in a bit worse for wear after trying to keep up with Coogan’s appetite for hookers and cocaine, which got more media coverage in the U.S. than some of Coogan’s films. As did Coogan’s brief gruesome-twosome fling with Courtney Love.\n\nSaxondale: A has-been roadie who now runs his own pest control business and frequents an anger management group. Like Alan Partridge, he’s a bit of a bore and a looser, frequently reliving his glory years spent hanging out with Pink Floyd and Bonny Tyler. He lives with his large, younger girlfriend Magz, played by excellent Welsh actress Ruth Jones and employs a sidekick named Raymond (Rasmus Hardiker) whom they treat like a son.\n\nMorning Matters: In the summer of 2010, every British newspaper in the land reported that Alan Partridge would make a comeback series online for Australian lager giant Fosters. In a press release, Steve Coogan announced, in character: “I am delighted to announce that after years as a regional broadcaster on North Norfolk Digital my groundbreaking radio segment, Mid Morning Matters, will now be accessible to a potential audience of billions via the World Wide Web (www).”\n\nThe Trip: Coogan’s third project with Winterbottom, after 24 Hour Party People and the frenetic A Cock and Bull Story (based on the novel Tristram Shandy). He’s also reunited here with Welsh comedian Rob Brydon, who starred in the latter film. The two play only slightly fictionalized versions of themselves, touring restaurants in the north of England for the British newspaper The Observer. A sort-of comedic Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, they constantly spar with each other over impersonations, perhaps the funniest being Michael Caine. I first saw The Trip in parts on BBC television and I laughed so much, I emitted a little pee.\n\nThe Trip opens in Toronto in July 1st."
