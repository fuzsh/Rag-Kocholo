Born in Glasgow to Italian parents, Iannucci studied at the University of Glasgow followed by the University of Oxford. Starting on BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, his early work with Chris Morris on the radio series On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today.\n\nQuick Facts Armando Iannucci CBE, Birth name ...\n\nClose\n\nA character from this series, Alan Partridge, co-created by Iannucci, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programmes, including Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge and I'm Alan Partridge.

Iannucci created the HBO political satire Veep, and was its showrunner for four seasons from 2012 to 2015."
