        "text": "Pandemonium is a wild account of our great leaders grappling with the Pandemic and then with each other. A caustic entertainment for the winter months, it relates the Johnson-Truss-Sunak years in all their glory. Re-live the horror. The Mess. The Murk. The Lying about the Lies.\n\n'Jingle while you mingle. It’s one big party. Bring a suitcase.'\n\nArmando Iannucci says: “I wanted to write something furious and energetic about the past three years. Pandemonium is partly about us wanting those in charge to be up to the job, to be heroes, and the anger that started building when the news of the drinks parties began to emerge. And yes, I wanted to write something funny (don’t forget, we also had Liz Truss!). Laughter is a great release, and my aim is for the audience to have a good time and a good laugh, but I also hope it helps people process the tumultuous and crazy time we went through.”\n\nWayward Productions in association with Soho Theatre bring Pandemonium to the stage from 1 December 2023.\n\nArmando Iannucci is a political commentator, writer and director. His screenplay for the film In The Loop was Oscar nominated and his iconic series for the BBC, The Thick of It, was nominated for 13 BAFTA Awards, winning five. His series Veep picked up four Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series. He is the co- creator of the Steve Coogan character Alan Partridge. Armando wrote and directed the films The Death of Stalin, which was nominated for two BAFTAs and winner of Best Comedy at the European Film Awards, and The Personal History of David Copperfield (2020) which was nominated for a Golden Globe. He created HBO’s Avenue 5, the second season which aired in 2020.\n\nPandemonium is his first piece written for the theatre. He is currently working on an adaptation of Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove for 2024. More about that here.\n\nPATRICK MARBER (DIRECTOR)\n\nPatrick Marber is an award-winning playwright, screenwriter and director. His work has won Evening Standard, Olivier, Time Out, New York and London Critics’ Circle and Writers’ Guild Awards and received BAFTA, British Comedy and Royal Television Society Awards.
