        "text": "Prior to watching these fnal episodes of The Thick of It (among the few episodes I actually watched at the time of broadcast), I was musing that the decision to end the series at this time was probably a verry good one. Not for the obvious reason that the intensity with which it had been conducted throughout, in both writing and acting, could not be continued indefinitely without becoming the reason for it existing instead of the vehicle for the vision it pursued, but because actual politics in the Fractured Kingdom were about to become far more serious, and wierd, and beyond rational credibility than any satirical television comedy could top.\n\nWatching them, I think I was right, but not to the extent that I theorised. The Thick of It came to an end because of the obvious reason. Because it had gone as far as it could without sinking into repetition. Because it had never let go of its creative integrity. Because sometimes the logic of the situation is inexorable. It couldn’t last without smashing. It was the same as the sixth season of Homicide: Life on the Street, which saw Reed Diamond as Detective Mike Kellerman leave the show after three series, not because Diamond wanted to move on, or the producers were in any way unhappy with him, but because the consequences of his decision to shoot Druglord Luther Mahoney left him with no ground to stand upon.\n\nThe Thick of It ends with Malcolm Tucker’s resignation as Director of Communications, and his attempt to be arrested, quietly and with dignity, for Perjury before a Public Enquiry. The final three episodes, picking up fromNicola Murray’s Tucker-induce resignation as Leader of the Opposition, show this working out.\n\nThe heart of this sequence is episode 6, which is quite brilliant. It’s a complete change of pace, in every respect, dominated by four guest stars, antithetical to everything the show’s done, and it runs for an hour instead of thirty minutes, but it’s the culmination of everything the show’s been about. It’s the brick wall that everything runs head first into. It’s the naked glare of reality, that cannot be deflected or diverted. It is the roof being taken off Angband and all the squalid and noisome creatures inside being exposed to the light.\n\nBefore it, episode 5 is pure chaos. It’s everything running out of control as a consequence of the suicide of the offstage Mr Tickel. It’s all the rats on both sides, Government and Opposition, trying to make the blame fall on everyone else’s shoulders, not their own. It’s the incarnation of the sign reputed to sit on the desk of Ronnie Reagan’s Chief of Staff, Don Regan, that read ‘The Buck doesn’t even pause here’. Everyone leaks. And given the level, or depth rather, of incompetence of everybody, it blows up in their faces like a Texan oil-gusher, except it’s spewing out liquid shit instead (they use that metaphor: there is none better).\n\nSo episode 6 is the Inquiry. It’s an hour. It’s slow-paced. It takes place in one room, with limited camera angles. There is no incessant swearing. Televisually, it’s Mogadon. Apparently, the cast were not notified of the questions the panel were to ask so their responses are essentially improvisations. Everything outside the room is excluded, though we can infer that Malcolm Tucker is doing his best to deflect, distract and divert. But the Inquiry is doing what, in Yes Minister, we’re told is the antithesis of its purpose: it is seeking the truth. it is asking straight questions and it wants straight answers, and when it doesn’t get them it doesn’t move on, it asks the questions again, and it expects straight answers. And the subtlety of the cast members, and how they respond to these questions in words and body language is astounding.\n\nThat’s the climax, the actual ending. The last episode is just the aftermath, the reverbrations of what’s happened, the shock to this system being absorbed and ultimately cast out. Dan Miller, the new Opposition Leader, wants Tucker out but Tucker knows he’s out. He says so at the end of episode 6, he’s finished. Tucker was based on Alistair Campbell, who also resigned when he became the story. Ollie Reeder, snotty, sarky, nasty, vile Ollie, takes his place, achieving his ambition but we don’t need Tucker’s take-down of him to know that he is only proving the Peter Principle, that everybody rises to the level of their own incompetence: he will get his and far faster. He hasn’t got the stamina.\n\nGlenn Cullen resigns to, intending to hand himself in for perjury, but changes his mind and doesn’t. He also makes a speech of it that contains nothing but home truths that everyone dismisses and ignores. And, just in case we’re assuming any kind of catharsis has taken place, that the new boss/world will be at all different from the old boss/world, in the final seconds another crisis blows up, The last line comes from Peter Mannion, offscreen, and it’s ‘This has been a shitty day.’\n\nHail and farewell. Who would dare to satirise UK politics post-2016? Who the fucketty fuck could?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s still funny, but this was where it stopped being funny.\n\nThe Thick of It is composed of many things, but cynicism, outrage, anger and disgust are very high on the list of ingredients in the same way that tuna is high on the list when you’re making a tuna casserole. There’s no point in saying that it wouldn’t be quite the same without them, because it just wouldn’t be without them. It’s exactly the same as YesMinister, only completely different: you laugh not only because the jokes are funny but because, not very deeply inside you, you believe that this is exactly what it is really like, only it’s a lot safer confined to 28 minutes and 50 seconds on BBC2 once a week.\n\nThe point is that this is supposed to be just that bit exaggerated, a little bit OTT or even mildly surreal, real life taken that bit further than it’s gone this particular Wednesday, so you can maintain the polite fiction to yourself that it is exaggerated and it’s not as bad as this really.\n\nAnd three episodes like this hit you in the face, one after another, slap, slap, slap, until you’re seeing stars like in some old Tom and Jerry cartoon, and you connect this which was fiction in 2012 with what you see and hear about you in 2023, and it stops being so fucking funny after all.\n\nThings have changed. In Life, as in Art, there’s been a change of Government. Let’s make no bones about it, the Tories are in power now, propped up by the Liberal Democrats (for whom I voted in that Election and never will again: this is personal). The old ‘gang’ has broken up, with Glenn Cullen and Terri Coverley still at DoSAC, working under the new split regime alongside the new masters, Roger Mannion, Stewart, Emma and Phil, whilst Nicola Murray is somehow Leader of the Opposition, with Ollie in her camp and Malcolm Tucker still fucker-in-chief. We flip-flop back and forth between the two camps, Labour in episodes 2 and 4, Tory in between like they got the first episode of the series.\n\nThere’s a disconnect here, one of the few places where Ianucci & Co have elided the hard bit, the bit that the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine scripters left out because it was too hard, because over her two episodes we see how shitty Murray is as Leader, ridden by nerves, indecisiveness, insincerity and a blindingly obvious lack of competence that sees her defenestrated in episode 4 and not a moment too soon, but given that she was exactly the same in series 3, how the hell did she get the job in the first place? Plausibility gap the size of the Grand Canyon.\n\nHow it’s done to her, the complexity of the plotting that co-opts Ben Swain and simultaneously clears him out of the way to procure the coronation of the sinister smoothie Dan Miller, is all very good. The personal responses of everyone involved, especially Murray herself, are brilliantly expressed. But how she got there to be toppled is the hole in the doughbut for which not custard, not chocolate nor oversweet strawberry jam is even suggested.\n\nIn between, we get the brusque, tired, put upon Peter Mannion, DoSAC Minister, giving up his Bank Holiday to attend one of guru Stewart Pearson’s ‘Thought Camps’. Mannion’s the good guy in all this. He might be a Tory, and no-one conceals that, but he’s Ken Clarke to everybody else’s Cameron-and-Osborne. He’s common sense and plain speaking, he’s the hunan being in the room and he’s the living representative of our reaction to Stewart, the one really seriously despicable figure in all this with his bullshit speak and thinking. But he’s a Tory, just like Clarke was and still is a Tory.\n\nAnd they get the stinking tragedy, the man made homeless by Governent policies who commits suicide by exhaust poisoning the day they’re coming to evict him from his tent. Only Glenn Cullen reacts as you’d hope you would react, sseeing this as a human being, a person destroyed. It’s a cold moment that hits foursquare because up to now the reality of the man’s position has been obscured, deliberately, by giving him a funny name that everyone pronounces like one of tthe Mr Men.\n\nIt’s real, it’s bitter, it’s funny, but that’s the problem. The real thing has gotten out of hand. It isn’t funny. It’s the very reverse of funny. And it takes The Thick of It with it today.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’ll let you into a secret: I don’t particularly like these weeks where my triple episodes cross the transition between series. Usually, it’s not that serious, as in the case of Yes Minister last week, where the only real change was Paul Eddington’s haircut, but I’m nevertheless conscious that I’m mixing two different sets of themes. A series is the product of a period of thinking and writing, and even when it’s not abut a particular aspect, it’s nevertheless the product of concentrated thinking about this group of stories, and inspired by the times in which it’s been written. A succeeding series stems from a changed collective consciousness, however subtle the difference might be.\n\nIt’s very obvious in the case of The Thick of It, and especially the transition between these two series. The final two episodes of series are not only a two-parter but the culmination of the tracks laid throughout the series. The Government of which Nicole Murray is a Minister is on its last legs, an Election is going to have to be called in the near future, the political pendulum is swinging towards the Opposition, who can’t be named as the Tories any more than Murray’s party can be identified as New Labour, and in the meantime, after his mini-breakdown in front of Terri Coverley in episode 6, Malcolm Tucker is no longer at the sharp end, on leave. His replacement, whether temporary or not, is Steve Flemming (David Haig), an old adversary that Malcolm previously has sacked, but who now has the upper hand.\n\nI’ve got to hand it to both the writers and Haig. Flemming is an incredible creation whose every word, gesture, grin and barely subdued temper tantrum marks him out as a completely different character to Tucker and yet, for all his more superficially glad-handing style, is even more repellent. Tucker is what you see him to be. He might be incredibly manipulative and shameless but Flemming is a smiling shitweasel that you cannot trust for one second, and Haig’s faux-jocularity conveys that at every moment. Tucker’s anger is the core of him, Flemming’s is suppressed but nevertheless visible and when it erupts it is all about losing control whilst Tucker, despite the events of episode 7 in which it is clear that he is weakened, is nevertheless fully controlled and directeed.\n\nEpisode 7 ends with Tucker’s sacking, carried out in splendiferously vicious and snide manner by Julius Nicholson, though as far as the Press is concerned it’s a resignation. Shades of Alistair Campbell, the avatar for Malcolm Tucker. The reaction is unsurprising and catalystic. There’s mass rejoicing, especially at DoSac, but at the same time there’s an underlying acceptance that that’s it, the Government’s fucked, as if only Malcolm has been driving it successfully. Nicola Murray decides to quit British politics, join a prestgious (and prosperous) American think-tank at Yale. Glen Cullen and Ollie Reeder’s war of antipathy continues over their post-Department futures.\n\nAnd as you clearly expect, by the next episode Nicholson is bringing Tucker back, and Flemming is being sacrificed (with a nasty underhand and quite brilliant push towards the pointy bit of the sword from a certain re-employed spin doctor). We’re left to draw our own inferences, it’s never said that Flemming was basically shit at his job, but that was what I read into it. But there’s a reason why Nicholson brings Malcolm back and it has nothing to do with personal preference.\n\nThere’s also a rebel faction in the party, a cabal backing Dan Miller for party leader. Flemming goes over to them, noisily. Tucker fucks over Murray’s move to America to delay the cabal’s Election-losing move (though she has nothing to do with it, her unrelated resignation will trigger the cabal’s actions). And in the closing seconds, the Election is called. Malcolm exhorts his troops and, in parallel, Stewart Pearson, along with Peter Allam and his team, start their campaign, its outcome to be decided…\n\nSeries 3 aired in 2009. By the time The Thick of It returned, in September 2012, British Government had changed hands. The Coalition was in power. So The Thick of It changed to reflect that, as it had to do if it were to be the embittered, frenetic mirror of our politics and their priorities. It was a courageous thing to do and not everybody welcomed the first episode, which had no Malcolm, no Nicola, no Ollie. Only Glen Cullen and Terri Coverley of the regular cast appeared, both still in DoSAC., she wanting to be made redundant. Everyone else, well, not entirely, were new. Peter Mannion was the Minister, and Roger Allam’s bored and resentful cynic was brilliantly written and performed, plus his aides Emma Messinger and Phil Smith, plus new additions in the form of Mannion’s Lib Dem junior Minister and unwanted partner. Despite the absence of Peter Capaldi, the swearing was still impressve and ornate, and the different atmosphere a joy to follow. Not for one of the reviewers on imdb, mind you, but he was an idiot.\n\nSo the scene is set for Ianucci and co to anatomise politics in Britain 2012, when things could still be called miserly, vicious and hateful, but not yet totally insane. Next time we get to see how our familiar faces are coping out of power. In four weeks.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhat wasn’t immediately apparent from the first three episodes of this series was that the extended series length, eight episodes as opposed to three, was the ideal structure for Armando Ianucci and his team to build an underlying story arc. Now it’s becoming apparent. And, given that this series was being broadcast in 2009, with the real-life Labour Government on which it’s silently based sliding towards its end, what better structure than the Government of which Minister for Social Affairs and Citizenship Nicola Murray is a member sliding towards a near inevitable electoral defeat?\n\nNot that any of this directly approaches our chaotic ministry until the third of these three episodes, but it’s implied from the first of these. We’ve already had mention of Shadow Minister Peter Mannion and now Roger Allam comes onstage, paying a visit to the Ministry. There’s not even an Election called but one’s clearly in the wind so this is a supposed courtesy visit, not for political purposes but to put faces to names, find out where the toilets are, that sort of thing.\n\nNeedless to say, it’s daggers drawn between the political advisers. In the home camp we have Glen Cullen and Ollie Reeder, and I am coming to loathe Ollie as the most hateful and hate-filled figure, full of poisonous remarks about anyone and everyone, a total prick constantly pricking everything it can see.You could say this is a testament to Chris Addison as well as the w riting, but at a certain point the construction of a radioactive shitheap in human form develops a toxicity that requires lead-lined bunkers built for a thousand year span and after episode 4, indeed long before I had finished watching it, I was mentally seeking contractors’ estimates.\n\nMannion has his own team, about whom he is appropriately jaded from the outset. in fact, that’s the keynote of Allam’s performance. He’s seen too much, he’s going through the motions, everything around him that represents Malcolm Tucker-era politics basically disgusts him but not to the extent of being prepared to give up in practice. We’re already familiar with Emma Messenger (Olivia Poulet), his scriptwriter and Ollie’s firlfriend, and his researcher Phil Smith (Will Smith), who’s the Ollie-equivalent, nowhere near as nasty despite his every effort, but equally a twat, a pathetic moron who hasn’t outgrown Prep School. Now we meet Mannion’s spin doctor, Stewart Pearson (Vincent Franklin), a laidback, quasi-visionary gobblede-gook speaker, who lacks Tucker’s rage and vitriol (he doesn’t swear once) but who is out there beyond the stars.\n\nMannion himself comes over as a decent human being who has a mind of his own, and has limits beyond which he w on’t go. This is woven into the other aspect of the story, which is that Ella, Murray’s daughter, the one forced into a shit Comprehensive, is turning wild, becoming a bully and about to be exc;uded, i.e., expelled. Murray’s an incompetent. If this weren’t The Thick of It, you’d wonder how she ever got to this level, with a husband who won’t support his daughter, but even though the chaotic situation is of her own making and due to the jellyfish nature of her spine, it’s a deeply painful and very human situation, and the eleven year old girl is an innocent victim of all this. Mannion, once he learns about this confidential situation that everyone knows about, assures Murray he won’t exploit it, and tells Stewart and Co to lay off, but once Tucker gets involved, things spiral out of control.\n\nIt’s a frantic episode conducted at extreme pace, as is episode 5, when Murray and Mannion clash on BBC Radio Five Live’s Richard Bacon Show. This is more of an orthodox farce especially in its speed, but both episodes come over as having forty-five minutes of material that’s got to be got through in thirty. This is funnier than epoisode 4 because it doesn’t have any degree of serious consequences to it, but it’s a clash of personalities, beliefs and opinions on every level, from the political to the personal – Emma is dumping Ollie through this though it’s the idiot Phil who delivers the coup de gras – and there’s way too much to summarise. But it builds up to a head to head between Malcolm and Stewart, in which both go nuclear with what H-Bombs they can through at the other before coming to a truce that’s as much mutual respect as it is recognition of the MAD thart would result.\n\nAfter that, episode 6 is almost relaxing in contrast, the pace dialled down. It’s built on a subtlety that opens our eyes to the genuine perils with the Press. Nicola Murray is trying to launch her ill-thought out Fourth Sector policy but a casual and seemingly innocuous choice of words leaves her vulnerable to an accusation that she’s planning a leadership challenge to a Prime Minister who’s heading for electoral defeat. She isn’t. She’d never get anywhere. But Tucker arrives, stomping his boots and, for once, floundering under the extreme pressure he’s under. The PM’s on an International Tour, taking a rival spin doctor with him.\n\nThis culminates in an extraordinary scene in which Terri confronts Malcolm over the mistakes he’s made today and he undergoes a near mental breakdown that made me want to leap straight to the next episode but that’s for next time.\n\nThe increased stress of the first two episodes didn’t sit too well with me this week, and I wasn’t laughing too much at any of it. Overall, I think it was just that bit too fast and furious, and I would have preferred more space to let one line sink in when five others were hurtling past it, but that’s the point and design of the series. Time to relax.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nChris Langham was found guilty and sentenced to prison. This allowed Armando Iannucci and his team to restart The Thick of It and move forward. The Specials had ended with a change of Prime Minister, thus the natural next step was a Cabinet Reshuffle in which Hugh Abbott was out and the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship needs a new Minister. There’s one tine problem: no-one, or rather no-one of any standing whatsoever, will take on the job. Ultimately, it becomes a straight choice between Malcolm Tucker’s left bollock with a smiley face painted on it, or Nicole Murray. Enter Rebecca Front.\n\nThe Thick of It‘s third series consisted of eight episodes, as many as the series had lasted up to that point. Overall, the background is that of a governing Party on the slide, heading towards a General Election that it’s going to lose, and frantically beating against the tide. Introducing Nicola Murray gave the series a new slant. She’s an obscure Junior Minister, so low on the totem pole that she is not just the very last option but Tucker has not been able to vet her for her suitability. She’s installed in desperation: Tucker’s already aware that her husband is caught up in a PPI scandal but he doesn’t know that her sixteen year old daughter is a heroin addict whose had an abortion already nor, which is even worse, she intends to send her eleven year old daughter to an independent secondary school.\n\nMurray is the nearest thing to an ingenue in this series (with the possible exception of secretary Robyn Murdoch, who’s less ingenue than thick). She’s decent and well-meaning in herself but she’s about to have a blowtorch applied to all her extremities and the name of that blowtorch is Malcolm Tucker, with in-house log fires supplied by Glenn Cullen and Ollie Reeder, who are kept on, partly because they know what they’re doing (hah hah!) but primarily because Murray seems to be so inept that she doesn’t have ‘people’ of her own to bring with her.\n\nAnd, let’s be honest, Murray isn’t up to the job. She’s as self-oriented and blame-averse as Hugh Abbott was but she falls into all the traps, even the blatantly obvious ones. In the first episode, she lets herself get photoed against a bye-election poster for Liam Bentley in such a way as to obscure the L and allow the photographers to frame her again ‘I AM BENT’. In the second, her Department having lost seven months data on immigrants, irretrievably, she attends an Off The Record lunch at the Guardian but blurts this out in the presence of a freelance journalist (the lovely Zoe Telford) who is decidedly On The Record.\n\nThis brings the wrath of Malcolm down upon her head, and if we think we have seen Malcolm being wrathful before, we have not yet seen him like this. Some of it is perhaps that his expletive-ridden shouting at Murray comes over as mysogynistic because it’s being directed at a woman, but it’s also true that the third series has upped the pace, upped the choatic, upped the frenetic and abandoned completely the slow of comprehension. It’s completely true to life in a Government collapsing and a Minister who is not only inadequate – in this show, they all are – but naive as well.\n\nSo naive that, on at least two occasions, Murray tries to hold off the verbal ordure by trying to leap straight to the solution without the theatrics, but it doesn’t work. I can imagine my Dad loving Yes Minister for its wit and cleverness, but loathing The Thick of It for its liberal, almost excessive use of creative swearing. I had concerns about that myself when I first tried to watch the series, but Iannucci and Co have made it symphonic in its sweep and inventiveness.\n\nEpisode 3, set at the Party Conference in Eastbourne and guest starring Melanie Hill as a plain-speaking campaigner, introduced Murray opposite number, Peter Mannion, though not in person. He would become more significant before long.\n\nOne thing that came over, very forcefully, in these three episodes, enabled by Murray’s naievete and inexperience, was just how artifical a Politician has to be, given the vulterine qualities of the Press. The number, size and sheer variety of hoops they have to jump through was frightening, but worst of all was the effect it had on their families. It’s explicit in episode 1, when Tucker forces Murray to choose between sacrificing her husband and sacrificing her eleven year old. Of course, she could have resigned, and protected them both but, yeah, right.\n\nI also found myself developing a healthy dislike for Ollie Reeder, the smug, self-satisfied, superior little shit. Chris Addison did too good a job of incarnating his hatred for Glehn Cullen, his nonstop, vicious taunting, his unending innuendo. If i were Glen, Ollie would be well advised not to hang around at the top of the Department’s many stairways…\n\nAfter not really getting series 1, I rejoined The Thick of It sometime in the back half of series 3. I’ll be catching up with myself before too long.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
