The creator of some of the most original and influential television comedy of recent years, Glaswegian-Italian Armando Iannucci is a writer, performer, director and producer.

With Steve Coogan, Armando created the character of Alan Partridge, first on Radio 4's On The Hour and then in the BBC 2 version, The Day Today. He and Coogan went on to take the hapless celebrity through several spin-offs, including Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge as well as books and the film Alpha Papa.

Armando devised, wrote and directed the ground-breaking series The Thick Of It. The mockumentary about under-prepared ministers and civil servants received a clutch of awards, critical acclaim, and gave birth to the word 'omnishambles'. The Oscar-nominated film spin-off In The Loop won yet more accolades, including a New York Film Critics' Circle Award and three BAFTAs. Armando then developed HBO's international hit Veep, which sees Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Vice President deal with the realities of being both close to and far from the most powerful office in the world.

Other television credits includes Brass Eye, Time Trumpet, Lab Rats and The Saturday Night Armistice. Armando has also appeared on Have I Got News For You and Question Time. On radio, he's joined the panels of The News Quiz and Quote Unquote and hosted his own show, Charm Offensive. He's also fronted programs on Radio 3 and written an opera libretto. As a Desert Island castaway, his luxury was a virtual sherry trifle.
