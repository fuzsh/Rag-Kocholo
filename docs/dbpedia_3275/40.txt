Armando Giovanni Iannucci, OBE is a Scottish satirist, writer, television director, and radio producer.

Iannucci studied at the University of Glasgow followed by the University of Oxford, leaving graduate work on a Ph.D. about John Milton to pursue a career in comedy. Starting on BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, his early work with Chris Morris on the radio series On the Hour was transferred to television as The Day Today. A character from this series, Alan Partridge, went on to feature in a number of Iannucci's television and radio programs, including Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge and I'm Alan Partridge. Iannucci also fronted the satirical Armistice review shows and in 2001 created his most personal work, The Armando Iannucci Shows, for Channel 4.

Moving back to the BBC in 2005, Iannucci created the political sitcom "The Thick of It" as well as the spoof documentary "Time Trumpet" in 2006. Winning funding from the UK Film Council, he directed a critically acclaimed feature film, "In the Loop", featuring characters from "The Thick of It" in 2009. Other works during this period include an operetta libretto, "Skin Deep", and his radio series Charm Offensive.

Iannucci created the HBO political satire "Veep" and was its showrunner for four seasons from 2012 to 2015. He followed this with the feature film "The Death of Stalin" in 2017.
