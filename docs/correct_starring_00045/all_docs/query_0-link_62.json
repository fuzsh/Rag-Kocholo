Beyond thunderdome DVD 1985 Mad Max - Az Igazság csarnokán innen és túl / Directed by George Miller, George Ogilvie / Starring: Mel Gibson, Tina Turner\n\nUPC 5996514008227\n\nREGION 2 PAL DVD\n\nMADE IN EU\n\nAUDIO: English 5.1, Hungarian mono\n\nSUBTITLES: English, Hungarian\n\nTotal Runtime: 98 minutes\n\nEnglish Summary:\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a 1985 Australian post-apocalyptic action film directed by George Miller and George Ogilvie, distributed by Warner Bros., and written by Miller and Terry Hayes. In this sequel to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Max (Mel Gibson) is exiled into the desert by the ruthless ruler of Bartertown, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), and there encounters an isolated cargo cult centred on a crashed Boeing 747 and its deceased captain. The film is the third installment in the Mad Max film series and the last with Gibson as Max Rockatansky. The series was given a fourth installment in 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy in the title role.\n\nIn post-apocalyptic Australia, Max Rockatansky is crossing the desert in a camel-drawn V8 wagon when he is attacked by a Transavia PL-12 Airtruk piloted by a man named Jedediah and his son. They steal his vehicle and belongings, and Max continues on foot, following their trail to the only developed location with power for miles, a community named 'Bartertown.' Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, Max is brought before the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her.\n\nAunty explains that Bartertown’s electrical supply depends on a crude methane refinery powered by pig feces. The refinery is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. \"Master Blaster\" holds an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster. According to Bartertown law, conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death in a gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome. Max enters the subterranean Underworld refinery area to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds his stolen vehicle in Master/Blaster's possession and is forced to disarm his own booby-trapped engine. Here he discovers that although Blaster is exceptionally strong, he is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises, which severely disorient and incapacitate him.\n\nHungarian Summary:\n\nMax Bartertownba jut. Ennek törvényen kívüli lakóit Aunty Entity irányítja, aki a jövevényben kapóra jött segítséget lát riválisa ellen, aki az energiaforrásokat birtokolja. A félelmetes Viharkupolában kerül sor a párviadalra, amelyet Mad Max súlyos sebek árán tud megnyerni. Entity ezzel elérte célját, s a hőst kiűzi a sivatagba. Egy elvadult gyermeksereg megmenti, s ő velük indul Bartretown ellen.\n\nCast / Szereplők:\n\nMel Gibson as \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky, a former MFP officer and lone warrior. Max roves the desert aimlessly, his existence entirely based around self-survival.\n\nTina Turner as Aunty Entity, the ruthless, determined ruler of Bartertown. Entity is a glamorous, Amazon-like figure who recognises a strength of character in Max, and hopes to exploit him to gain sole control of Bartertown from Master. Despite her brutality and Bartertown's chaos, Entity is an intelligent, cultured woman, who holds a hope of one day rebuilding society to its former glory. In regard of the character, Miller said, \"We needed someone whose vitality and intelligence would make her control over Bartertown credible. She had to be a positive character rather than a conventional evil 'bad guy.' We had worked on the script with [Turner] in mind. But we had no idea if she'd be interested.\"[4]\n\nBruce Spence as Jedediah the Pilot, a marauding pilot who trades stolen goods in Bartertown. Spence previously played the Gyro Captain in Mad Max 2. \"They were well into the shoot when they offered me a part described as 'not the Gyro Captain but kind of like the Gyro Captain!'\" said Spence. \"They said there's kind of a reflection of him and that they were having difficulty casting the role so they thought to themselves, 'Why not Bruce!'\"[5]\n\nAdam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr., Jedediah's son, who often helps his father steal supplies, flying his father's aeroplane while Jedediah procures the goods.\n\nFrank Thring as The Collector, head of Bartertown's trade and exchange network.\n\nAngelo Rossitto as Master, a diminutive former engineer, who parlays his technical expertise into building the methane extractor responsible for Bartertown's electricity. When the film begins, Master has grown power-crazed under the protection of Blaster, and the reverence he receives from the people of Bartertown. He frequently humiliates Entity into acknowledging his power over her. When Blaster is killed however, Master becomes a far more subdued, humble character, and eventually escapes with the help of Max, Pig Killer, and the children.\n\nPaul Larsson as Blaster, Master's silent, mentally-impaired bodyguard.\n\nAngry Anderson as Ironbar Bassey, head of Bartertown's security and Aunty Entity's Number One Henchman. Despite his short height he is a fierce warrior figure, wearing a doll's head standard on his back, who comes to dislike Max more and more as the film proceeds. After several near-death incidents where his survival becomes more and more unlikely, he is presumably killed in the film's climactic chase, last seen giving the middle finger to the escaping heroes.\n\nRobert Grubb as Pig Killer, a convict in Bartertown sentenced to work in the methane refinery, shovelling pig feces. He befriends Max, and when Max and the children return to rescue Master, Pig Killer escapes to help them.\n\nHelen Buday as Savannah Nix, leader of a tribe of child survivors (or the children of those survivors) from a crashed 747. Savannah is the one who ensures the tribe remembers its past through the \"tells\" and acts as a surrogate mother figure to many of them. She is also the partner of Slake.\n\nTom Jennings as Slake M'Thirst, the male leader of the child tribe.\n\nEdwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood, the flamboyant Master of Ceremonies and chief auctioneer of Bartertown.\n\nRod Zuanic as Scrooloose. The misfit child able to copy everyone else's abilities and manners.\n\nGeorge Spartels as Blackfinger.\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Miller\n\nGeorge Ogilvie\n\nProduced by George Miller Written by\n\nTerry Hayes\n\nGeorge Miller\n\nStarring\n\nMel Gibson\n\nTina Turner\n\nMusic by Maurice Jarre Cinematography Dean Semler Edited by Richard Francis-Bruce\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nKennedy Miller Productions\n\nDistributed by Warner Bros.\n\nRelease date\n\n10 July 1985\n\nRunning time\n\n98 minutes Country Australia Language English\n\nProduct Reviews\n\nNo reviews yet Write a Review"
