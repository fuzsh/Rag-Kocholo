        "text": "Why so mad, Mad Max?\n\n“A few years from now” in Australia (and probably more places than that, let’s be honest), the highways and byways are filled with motorcycle gangs. Enter the Main Force Patrol, a sort of highway patrol cobbled together by whatever is left of the Australian government. The Main Force Patrol (you’ll also hear them referred to dismissively in the film as “The Bronze”) struggles to keep order on the roads as society collapses and people fight over resources such as gasoline. I know it’s really hard to imagine something like that happening, but this is just a movie so please try to suspend your disbelief.\n\nAs we meet the MFP, they’re trying to re-apprehend a criminal known as The Nightrider. Well, some of them are. Others are napping in their cars or creepily spying on horny couples “in the act.” The Nightrider escaped custody and wasted a rookie MFP officer on his way out. Now, he’s tearing down the highway with his girlfriend riding shotgun as he broadcasts a bizarre combination of a wrestling promo and a sermon over the airwaves. The Nightrider bills himself as a “fuel-injected suicide machine” who was “born with a steering wheel in his hand and lead in his foot.” Sounds pretty painful.\n\nThe chase escalates into widespread property damage and reckless endangerment. The situation soon calls for the MFP’s top pursuit man, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), to enter the fray. Having dispensed with the riffraff, The Nightrider calls out the best. And the best is what he’ll get! What results is the catalyst to a chain of events that will put Max and his family into the crosshairs of a savage biker gang, and shake Max to the core of his being.\n\nMax hits the scene and shatters The Nightrider’s nerve by beating him in a high-speed game of chicken. The now blubbering Nightrider loses control of his vehicle and goes up in a fireball. Perhaps he should have taken a few more driving lessons? The Nightrider was portrayed by actor Vincent Gil, who didn’t have a driver’s license prior to filming this scene. Gil was given 16 lessons with a driving school in order to get his license and keep everything legal, and even then his vehicle was operated by stunt coordinator Grant Page. Although Page can’t be seen inside the vehicle, he “awkwardly positioned himself inside the car, but out of frame.” Between Page, The Nightrider, AND The Nightrider’s girlfriend, that must have been one crowded front seat. By the way, look carefully during the scene involving The Nightrider’s demise for a quick glance at the rocket car that almost proved deadly in real life.\n\nA successful Max relaxes at home with his wife Jessie and their son, “Sprog” (slang for child). The next morning, he heads to the “Halls of Justice” early and meets with his best pal and coworker, Jim Goose (Steve Bisley, one of Gibson’s real-life housemates at the time). Goose and the station mechanic show Max a powerful car getting worked on in the garage: “the last of the V8 Interceptors.” Max, understandably, digs the car and wants to take it for a spin right away. But what he doesn’t know is that it’s bait strategically placed by his superior officer, Captain Fifi Macaffee (Roger Ward), in order to keep Max on the force. Fifi is dedicated to the cause of giving the public their “heroes” back, and Max is a figure that he can’t afford to lose to early retirement.\n\nUnfortunately for Max, Fifi informs him that the word on the street is The Nightrider’s surviving associates know about Max and will be out for revenge. Max shakes off the warning with a laugh. The motorcycle gang, led by The Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), arrives in town to claim The Nightrider’s body and wastes no time making their presence known by shouting, fighting, and harassing the residents. Eventually, the gang mounts up in full force to chase down a couple who tried to make a getaway in their car. Forcing them off the road, Toecutter and his minions wreck the car with their weapons and then violently assault the couple.\n\nMax and Goose get the call over the radio and head over to check out the scene of the crime. Most of Toecutter’s gang has departed, leaving behind a single member, Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns), and the woman from the car (now on a leash). Max arrests Johnny the Boy as Goose consoles the victim and gets her to safety. Back at headquarters, Goose nearly loses his mind with rage when he is ordered to release Johnny. What’s going on? Fifi and Max explain that no one showed up to Johnny’s trial to press charges, seemingly having been intimidated into silence. With no witnesses willing to testify against him, Johnny’s lawyers secure his freedom. Refusing to accept this, Goose assaults Johnny in the station parking lot before being restrained, and Johnny leaves with a final deadly warning to Goose.\n\nLater that night, Johnny the Boy sabotages Goose’s motorcycle while the officer is out on the town. This causes the bike to wreck, although our boy The Goose escapes with just some bumps and bruises. He borrows a vehicle to get his bike back to town, at which point Johnny ambushes him and tosses a drum brake through his windshield. Goose’s vehicle wrecks and turns upside down, leaking gasoline. Toecutter orders Johnny to strike a match and burn Goose alive. It appears that Johnny the Boy wasn’t planning on escalating matters quite to that level, and a scene that was getting Rube Goldberg-ish gets bailed out by some powerful acting. Needless to say, The Goose is cooked. (Sorry. I’m sorry.)\n\nConcerned for his best friend, Max tries to visit Goose in the hospital. However, seeing his friend burned beyond recognition causes Max’s sanity to begin to crack. He tries to resign from the MFP, but Fifi won’t have it. After a back and forth, during which Max admits to starting to like all the…madness…out there on the streets, Fifi convinces him to take a couple weeks off and really think about his decision.\n\nMax takes Jessie and Sprog on a family vacation, presumably to stay with their friend May. Along the way, Max negotiates a spare tire repair with a local mechanic as Jessie takes Sprog for an ice cream break. As misfortune would have it, Toecutter’s gang is lurking in the area and harasses Jessie. Jessie and Sprog manage to escape and reunite with Max. Together again, the family heads to May’s and tries to put the incident behind them. Toecutter’s crew isn’t finished with them, however. As Jessie learns, a gang member named Cundalini tried to latch on to her escaping vehicle with a chain and ended up leaving a grim totem behind: his severed hand.\n\nThe motorcycle gang tracks the Rockatansky family down and again menaces Jessie in the woods nearby. Jessie flees back to May’s while Max grabs a gun and heads into the woods to try to track them down. A panicked Jessie realizes she must have left Sprog behind and heads back outside to find her son. The gang, however, are waiting for her and have already grabbed the child. Toecutter talks about returning Sprog in exchange for Cundalini’s missing hand, but to me this just seems like idle banter before the villain moves in for the kill. Jessie and Sprog are rescued by the gun-toting May, and the wily old lady locks the gang in a room and escapes with Jessie and Sprog by vehicle.\n\nShockingly, their vehicle dies shortly after making it to the open road. With the gang mounted up and in hot pursuit, May attempts to hold them off long enough for Jessie and Sprog to escape on foot. Sadly, May is a terrible shot and completely misses everyone. In a heartbreaking scene, Toecutter deliberately speeds up and rides over the fleeing Jessie and Sprog. Max finally catches up to the chase and loses what’s left of his sanity as he grieves over the bodies of his family. The gang cruises off into the distance. We learn that Sprog was dead on arrival at the hospital and Jessie has a long list of traumatic injuries. While I don’t believe the movie conclusively decides her fate, we can pretty much assume that Jessie doesn’t survive much longer.\n\nNearing his breaking point, Max returns to headquarters and takes the V8 Interceptor without permission. Heading back to the mechanic, Max viciously grills him for info about Toecutter and his gang. I may have missed the connection here, because Max asks him about a tattoo. Did the mechanic used to run with Toecutter’s gang, or does he just fix their bikes? Anyway, Max gets the info he’s after and begins his quest for revenge.\n\nFirst, he steers the Interceptor into a group of the bikers, effectively taking out Mudguts (David Bracks) and Clunk (played by Bertrand Cadart, who also helped supply Miller and Kennedy with customizations for the film’s motorcycles). Johnny the Boy manages to get away and alerts the rest of the gang from an emergency phone box. Preparing to mount up and come looking for Max, Toecutter pauses when two photographs unexpectedly fall out of his motorcycle helmet. One photograph is of Jessie and Sprog, and the other is Jim Goose…leaving no doubts as to who has been coming after the gang.\n\nOn the hunt, Max spots a discarded motorcycle and investigates on foot. It’s a trap! Johnny the Boy played dead long enough for Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry), Toecutter’s second in command, to take Max out with a bullet to the knee. While a wounded Max reaches for his gun, Bubba drives his bike over Max’s outstretched arm. Playing with his food, Bubba Zanetti prepares to take a second run at Max. This time, however, Max is ready and drops Zanetti with a burst from his sawed off shotgun. The Toecutter and Johnny the Boy take off in different directions, and Max chooses to pursue the head honcho. Operating strictly on adrenaline by this point, Max limps back to the Interceptor and takes off after Toecutter.\n\nThe shark-like quality of the V8 Interceptor comes into play as a frantic Toecutter tries to put as much distance between his bike and the car as possible, only for the black on black vehicle to match his every move. Max finally gets his revenge on the villainous biker when Toecutter turns to check behind him and accidentally drives face-first into a semi-truck. (A brief video in the Blu-Ray bonus features admits that the real life owner of the truck didn’t want to damage his vehicle for the scene, prompting the movie crew to attach a fake grill to the front and paint it to resemble the actual front of the vehicle.)\n\nWith the Toe properly stubbed, Max finally tracks down Johnny the Boy by yet another wrecked vehicle. Johnny is stealing a pair of boots off a corpse. It’s unclear whether Johnny participated in the wreck or is doing some grave robbing. Johnny does claim innocence here, but Max is long past caring by this point. Max forces Johnny to cuff his ankle to the overturned vehicle and then prepares a trap for The Boy. Offering Johnny a hacksaw, Max presents the biker a choice of trying to saw through the handcuffs (estimated time: ten minutes) or sawing off his own foot (estimated time: five minutes) before the vehicle goes up in flames. A panicked Johnny takes this opportunity to partly deliver the movie’s title: “You’re mad, man!”\n\nMax and the Interceptor cruise over the hill as a visible fireball explodes in the background. Regardless of Johnny’s final choice, I think it’s safe to say he’s finished. With his vengeance finally complete, Max takes off for parts unknown. But he’s crossed the line and will never be the same again. What’s next for this lone wolf? Only time will tell…"
