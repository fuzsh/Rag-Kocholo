        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Ed Gillespie interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thanks for coming to Charlottesville.\n\nGillespie\n\nThanks for having me. It's good to be back.\n\nRiley\n\nWe have spoken before we came on the tape about the ground rules, the main one being confidentiality. There's one administrative chore we have to do as an aid to the transcriber. Rob is going to be keeping a sequence of interventions to aid the transcriber, but there are a lot of male voices around the table. I'm going to ask everybody to make a self-introduction and say just a few words to help the transcriber. I'm Russell Riley, chair of the Oral History Program.\n\nJones\n\nI'm Chuck Jones, Professor Emeritus, University of Wisconsin, Madison. I'm still crying about the Rose Bowl.\n\nPerry\n\nI'm Barbara Perry, a Senior Fellow here at the Miller Center Presidential Oral History Program.\n\nMartin\n\nI'm Rob Martin and I'll be taking notes for this session.\n\nMilkis\n\nI'm Sid Milkis. I'm in the Department of Politics and also have an appointment here. I'm head of a program called Democracy and Government Studies.\n\nNelson\n\nI'm Mike Nelson. I teach Political Science at Rhodes College and have an affiliation with UVA [University of Virginia] as well.\n\nRiley\n\nWe always like to get some biography before we get into an administration. In your case, I've talked with everybody at the table and they agree that your formative experiences before you even get to the 2000 election are really important. You had a role in, or a ringside seat to, an awful lot of important history before that election. We don't want to rob too much time from what happens in the 43rd Presidency, but if you could indulge us for an hour or two about some of those things we'd appreciate it.\n\nGillespie\n\nCertainly, I'd be happy to.\n\nRiley\n\nThe first thing is, we're familiar with your book and the interview you did with Frontline and we don't want to spend too much time going over territory that has already been plowed, but there was a question about your family background and whether politics was a part of your upbringing. Was there a sense that politics was important, and did your family have a kind of political disposition as you were growing up?\n\nGillespie\n\nThere was a sense that politics was important. I'm the son of an immigrant. My father came from Donegal in northwest Ireland at the age of nine. There was certainly a real sense of patriotism. He didn't talk about it much, but he was a legitimate World War II hero. He was an infantryman, a sergeant. He earned two Purple Heart medals, a Bronze Star, a Bronze Star with oak leaf cluster, and a Silver Star for his adopted country.\n\nThere was a sense of Irishness in our family but there was a strong sense of how fortunate we were to be Americans. Neither of my parents had the benefit of a college education, yet they're two of the smartest people I've ever known. My mother could have taught English here; she was a stickler for grammar.\n\nThere was certainly conversation around the table, but the truth is we weren't--my mother was a Democrat, Irish Catholic. I was born a Democrat, as I joke. Although it's not a joke if you're Irish, Catholic, born in New Jersey in 1961, the year John F. Kennedy was sworn in; they stamp it on your birth certificate. My father was a Democrat but he became an Independent during the [Jimmy] Carter years. He was a small-business owner and felt that the President's policies were not good for small-business owners.\n\nSo there wasn't political involvement. We didn't have fund-raisers at our house or anything like that. My mother was a trailblazer in her own right. She ran for and was elected to the school board in our township. She was the first woman ever to be elected to that position and that was a source of great pride in our home.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that in the '70s?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, I was about 10, so it was '71 or '72. She became president of the school board and she was on the board for about ten years. But you know, Washington, D.C., it may as well have been Paris, France. That was just not how we grew up. However, my father was an influential person in our small town. He was a grocer, and reminds me of something Robert F. Kennedy said when they asked him how did John Kennedy win the West Virginia primary and how did he win the nomination? He said the other guys were always trying to meet the president of the Chamber of Commerce or the county party chair, the big donor. We would go into a town and say, \"Who's the man to see?\" In my small town Jack Gillespie was the man to see; he knew everybody. He was tied into the church and from the grocery store, he would talk to people and he knew everybody by name. All that to say that politics wasn't formally part of my growing up. There was a fascination with it. There was a sense of patriotism.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you have siblings?\n\nGillespie\n\nFive, I'm one of six. I'm the fifth of six children. I grew up in a very tight-knit, classic, Irish Catholic household.\n\nRiley\n\nDid any of the others become politically active as you did?\n\nGillespie\n\nMy brother is political. He's an attorney up in South Jersey with a firm that does a lot of--he' a municipal lawyer, so he's pretty involved. They have strict pay-to-play rules up in New Jersey so you can't be too politically involved, but he is political. My sister is a volunteer for the county party up in New Jersey. She is a Republican as well. But the others, no, not really.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about your choice to go to Catholic University? It's in Washington and a lot of people choose to go to college in Washington because they do have an interest in national politics.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt chose me. I was rejected by Williams College, which is where I had my heart set on going. When I was rejected from there I thought it was the end of my life. I'm not going to be able to go to the college of my choice. One of my teachers, my student council advisor, told me that I ought to think of Catholic University.\n\nI was president of my student council and he felt that I had a penchant for politics. I'm sure all of you who are teachers hear this--if you don't, you should--but he was someone who saw in me something that I didn't even recognize in myself. So I went to Catholic University. I was going to be a journalist so I could cover politics, because I thought that was a way you could get close to it. I really didn't know how you got involved in it.\n\nSo that's how I ended up at Catholic University. I'm on the board of trustees there now. It's a wonderful institution. I'm very proud of my Catholic U degree and very committed to the school. I maintain a very strong involvement there.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you do any internships or any kind of political work?\n\nGillespie\n\nThat's how I got into it. If you're familiar with the grocery business you know that there's a small profit margin in owning a grocery store. We weren't poor, but we weren't wealthy. I went to school on student loans and I also worked three jobs. I was a Senate parking lot attendant; I was a short-order cook at what was then the American Caf√© on Capitol Hill, and I worked in the dining hall. I was in charge of the milk.\n\nThe first political job I ever had was parking cars in the Senate parking lot. That parking lot job led to an internship. One of the guys I was parking cars with had an internship with a Congressman by the name of Andy Ireland. He said it was a good office, it's fun, and there's an internship available there; you should apply. I got credits with the politics department at Catholic U. I interned for Andy Ireland, which I thought was kind of kismet given my family background. That was in 1983, which was my senior year.\n\nAndy was a boll weevil Democrat, a [Ronald] Reagan Democrat from the South, Florida. I was comfortable with that because my identity growing up was a Democratic household, so conservative Democrat made sense to me. I was not active in the pro-life community at Catholic U but that was a part of our upbringing as well and something I believe in. He was a pro-life Democrat. He was in favor of the Reagan tax cuts and that kind of thing. My dad, even though he was an Independent, was a Reagan supporter. My mother never crossed the party line. So it was a comfortable fit.\n\nWhile I was working for him his press secretary quit. He either quit or got fired. I was working for the press secretary; I was his intern. I ended up filling in and being acting press secretary my senior year in college. I actually would go into that office every day. My professors were OK with that; they thought it was good experience. I was a politics major. I thought I was going to get hired to be the press secretary, and I was disappointed when that didn't happen. I was counting on that. I really was out of luck when graduation came as I didn't have anything else lined up.\n\nSo I went back home and worked in my father's bar. My father joked that he lived every Irishman's dream: he had sold his store and he bought a bar.\n\nJones\n\nNot only Irishmen.\n\nGillespie\n\nI was thinking about going into the Air Force. I grew up right next to Fort Dix and McGuire Air Force Base, so there were a lot of military and a lot of retirees in our area. But then I got a call from the chief of staff in Andy Ireland's office and she wanted to know if I would be willing to move to Bradenton, Florida, and work in his district office. I said I was, and I left for Florida on August 1st, which was my 21st birthday.\n\nI drove down there and I lived there. I handled Social Security checks and VA [Veterans Administration] checks. I went to the Rotary Club lunches and I would travel with him and be his body guy when he came into the district. He switched parties in 1984 to run as a Republican with Reagan. He just wasn't comfortable running on the ticket with Walter Mondale. He was supportive of Reagan and he decided to announce that he was going to be a Republican and he ran as a Republican.\n\nJones\n\nHe did this before the election?\n\nGillespie\n\nHe did it before the election. He stood for election as a Republican and before any of the primaries in ample time--some people said he should have resigned, as Phil Gramm did. He didn't. He felt that announcing that, it's not like his vote was going to change and he gave the Democratic Party a chance to produce a nominee. There was a spirited contest for the nomination on their side.\n\nI thought about it and I thought, I'm with him. I think that's right. I changed my party affiliation then too. To a certain extent he and I personified what was going on at the time. He was a southern conservative Democrat who changed. I was a northeastern ethnic Catholic Democrat who changed. There was a lot of that going on in the Great Lakes area and the Northeast, in particular, for Irish and Italian and German Catholics who had been raised as a Democrat, and in the South for folks who had grown up in a Democratic Party system. So the two of us, to a certain extent, kind of captured what was going on at the time.\n\nNelson\n\nYou say in the book, somewhere along the line, words to the effect that you like reporters but you don't like the media. Did that in any way come out of your experience as a press secretary?\n\nGillespie\n\nLess as a press secretary, less as a congressional press secretary. It was really more when I had a more national interaction, a national role. The media, the reporters in Bradenton, Florida, and Sarasota and Polk County weren't that bad to deal with, in my estimation working for Congressman Ireland. Later I found that when you're dealing at the national level, you're swimming against the tide if you're a Republican, a conservative Republican press secretary in particular. But that's the way it is. I'm not bitter about it or anything.\n\nI like reporters and generally got along very well with them. But the media itself has gotten worse. It's much more pronounced now than it was in the '90s when I was really, you know, the Contract with America, then working for Dick Armey as House majority leader and then for Haley Barbour at the RNC [Republican National Committee]. I think it's more pronounced today even than it was then.\n\nJones\n\nWhy did you like reporters?\n\nGillespie\n\nWell, as I said, I wanted to be one at one point. I liked their interest in the political system and covering politics and I felt, still feel, that the role they play is important in informing the public about what's going on. I don't think they always get it right--I'm sure they think I don't always get it right--but I think that the free media and the free press are a very important part of our process and our system, and a healthy one. They're generally pretty gregarious people. You can have a couple of beers with them.\n\nJones\n\nSo it's partly lifestyle, the nature of what they do?\n\nGillespie\n\nThe nature of what they do, the fact that they're interested in what I'm doing. Right from the start they're asking me questions. That probably sums it up. I think they're generally interesting people, informed people, smart people. They were--this is impressionistic. I think back in the '80s and '90s, back in a little bit of the old days, when the old media certainly was dominant, there was more of a sense that it was as much a trade as a profession. There were fewer graduate degrees and Ivy League degrees. I don't begrudge that. As I said, if I had gotten into Williams I would have gone. But there's a little more pronounced elitist strain in the media today, especially the elite media, that I don't think is healthy. I think that they have a harder time checking their own viewpoints at the door, not just covering events, there is a lot of inflection in there.\n\nRiley\n\nThere were a lot of people in the '70s and '80s who moved into journalism, to an interest in journalism, by Watergate and [Bob] Woodward and [Carl] Bernstein.\n\nGillespie\n\nThat was my case.\n\nRiley\n\nSo your own sense of politics and your own political universe, [Richard] Nixon was not somebody that you had a particular affinity for?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo. Again, I came of age during Watergate and had a pretty healthy cynicism. I felt like what he had done was wrong, which it was, that it threatened the stability of the country and the faith in the institution of government and the executive branch. That was definitely a factor in my wanting to be a journalist; keep people honest. But also again, as I say, I had a fascination with politics and thought this would be a way to be near politics. I didn't ever actually think I could be in it.\n\nPerry\n\nYou said that your father's politics began to shift during the Carter years, but your mother never crossed over from being a Democrat?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo.\n\nPerry\n\nDid they comment on your shift, when you shifted over to the Republican Party?\n\nGillespie\n\nNot really because as I said, we didn't really talk politics. Issues and that kind of thing, but even then we didn't go into it all that deeply. My father was very hurt by the inflation of the '70s and at one point almost lost the store. My brother, who was then right out of law school, helped him fight to keep the store when it almost went under and he had creditors about to take it and that kind of thing. So he had a very tough time with it.\n\nMy mother and father were very proud that I was working for a United States Congressman. After I went to work for Dick Armey in '85, right at the very beginning, somehow we got tickets to one of the inaugural balls for President [George H. W.] Bush. So I guess that was '88; that was a little later, but I remember they just loved being at this inaugural ball. It was such a far cry from Donegal, Ireland, where my father came from, or even Philadelphia. It was just a black-tie-and-boots ball, which was the Texas State Society ball; it wasn't even one of the formal inaugural balls, but the fact that they were there truly was one of the highlights of their lives.\n\nPerry\n\nDid they see your ascent to the White House itself?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I don't think so. My father lived to see me become the RNC chairman and he was very proud of that. I made a specific reference to him in my acceptance speech up in New York at the summer meeting. But my mother was very proud of--She saw the Contract with America and they saved all the clips. She's not spinning in her grave that I'm a Republican. I think she felt conflicted about the party. When Andy Ireland changed parties--He didn't coin this phrase, but he said, \"I didn't leave the party, the party left me.\" For my mother in particular, the issue of life was a difficult one for her to reconcile with her allegiance to the Democratic Party.\n\nMilkis\n\nI'm interested to hear a little bit about the 1984 campaign. It's interesting. Ireland switches to the Republican Party. I'm curious about the special challenges that posed for you and whether or not you took any lessons from that that suited you well in the roles you played later.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt was different. There's not a strong union presence in that part of Florida, but your base obviously shifts. Andy had a tenuous relationship with the base anyway because he was a Reagan Democrat and pretty vocal about that, but he was popular for it. Really what happened was a lot of the conservative Democrats, the chamber of commerce Democrats--At that time the state senators and the state representatives were Democrats; they were conservative Democrats too. As you know, those kinds of changes occur first at the national level and kind of work their way down, as we've seen across the South. They weren't ready to make that change yet and when he did, it made it a little harder for them, so it created some strains.\n\nThen you're dealing with a different base. Now, Congressman Ireland had worked it out to where he was going to be unopposed in the Republican primary. You could do that back then, but you can't really do that now, it's a little harder. He had protected his seniority, but he was going from the majority to the minority. That was tricky. All of a sudden you're not in meetings with the people you were in meetings with a month ago, now you're in meetings with different people, although his base was really a congressional district base and he had a lot of Republicans for Ireland. We had a lot of Democrats for Ireland when he switched, so he had his own base. But you're in a different milieu. He was a little freer to espouse his views about Reagan and tax cuts and national security and things like that.\n\nNelson\n\nOne of the things that runs through your book is value placed on being somebody's guy, and that kind of personal loyalty.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nIf your friend in the Senate parking lot had said there's an internship with Chuck Schumer of New York, would you have gone for that or would you have been a different Ed Gillespie than you are now?\n\nGillespie\n\nThat's a really good question. I probably would have. I was pretty conservative in my political view to the extent that it was formed, but that was a formative time for me. It's conceivable because I do feel that loyalty is an important thing, and to a certain extent I had an awe of Members of Congress and Congress, and I still do. I mean, when I would walk into the Capitol, when I had my office in the Capitol, and it would be early in the morning and cold, I would think, I can't believe I get to walk up these steps and that my office is in the Capitol of the United States of America. When I would drive through the gates at the White House in the morning and they'd open up and I'd drive in and park next to the West Wing, I would think, I can't believe this. The hairs on the back of my neck would stand up.\n\nSo it's conceivable to me that that would have been the case. I doubt it though; I think I would have gotten the experience, would have seen how a congressional office works, but I couldn't have seen myself going to work for Chuck Schumer the way I could Andy Ireland, who was very much in sync with how I felt about policies and issues.\n\nRiley\n\nDid that remain true when you moved to work for Dick Armey?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt became deeper. Working for Dick Armey was like going to a tutorial every day. He's a former economics professor, really brilliant, and very thoughtful about legislating. I went to work for him when he was a freshman, his first month in office, February 1 of 1985.\n\nJones\n\nHow did you get selected?\n\nGillespie\n\nI wanted to be Andy Ireland's press secretary the second time around. He went through a second press secretary and I thought I was then in line to be the press secretary and that I had kind of earned it, and I was passed over for that. I was disappointed as I decided being a press secretary was what I wanted to do.\n\nJones\n\nYou had done a fair amount of press work with the press during the campaign, right?\n\nGillespie\n\nIn the District and on the campaign, but I think he wanted, and understandably so, a more seasoned press secretary. I was 21 years old. He was a more senior Member.\n\nSo I wanted to do press. I started quietly talking to friends from softball teams and things like that.\n\nRiley\n\nThe true network.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, it is. I interviewed in two or three offices. Interestingly enough, the person who brought me into the fold was in the Texas delegation. I really wanted to work for [David] Mac Sweeney, who had worked for Ronald Reagan in the White House and had gotten elected and was seen as a rising star. But I interviewed with Armey and I got the offer from Armey. I went back to Sweeney's office and said, \"I'm going to take the offer unless you're going to hire me, in which case I'll go to work for you.\" He didn't. Again, it's just one of the lessons I try to impart to my children. If I'd gotten accepted at Williams I'd probably be a lawyer in Boston right now, not that there's anything wrong with that.\n\nJones\n\nThere's probably a lot wrong with it. [laughter]\n\nGillespie\n\nThat's the professor on the record, not me. Not that I argue with that. If I hadn't been turned down by Mac Sweeney--you know he lost the next election. He didn't get reelected in his first bid, and Dick Armey went on to be the first Republican majority leader in the House in 40 years. We really hit it off, Armey and I. I loved the staff and the whole ethos. I remember one time there was a bill to subsidize cranberry gleaning. We had an argument that went for probably an hour over whether or not the government should be subsidizing cranberry gleaning. It was fascinating. Back and forth. We came down against the subsidy, which is the right place to be, but nobody else, I promise you, of the 435 Members of the House spent an hour talking about that bill.\n\nI remember my first month in office, there was a vote on the House floor on a bill by Pat Schroeder, it was a whistle-blower protection bill. It was to reward government workers for identifying waste or fraud or abuse. The vote was 415 to 1, and Armey was the 1. I remember getting a call from an AP [Associated Press] reporter, which for a freshman office is out of the ordinary. They wanted to know why Armey voted the way he did. I said I needed to check and I said, \"Why are you asking?\" He said, \"Did you not see the vote?\" I hadn't seen the vote; it was only about ten minutes after it had taken place. He said it was 415 to 1. I said, \"I'm guessing my boss was the 1.\" He said yes.\n\nSo it was a really interesting office environment, very exciting. It was Reagan's second term. There was a sense of energy and momentum and resurgence and there was a big freshman class, kind of like we've got now. Dick was great to work with. He was very accessible. He slept on his sofa back before that was cool. I don't know if it's cool now, but it was really out of the ordinary then. It was the college professor aspect of it. He was very hardworking. Then he gravitated toward [Newton] Gingrich and [John Vincent] Vin Weber and those guys, he became sort of an intellectual force. We passed the base closing bill in his sophomore term as a Member of the minority, which is pretty remarkable. That was a real media push. I was dealing with the New York Times editorial page and the Washington Post, and Dan Rather came in and did an interview. I'm working for a second-term Member of the minority.\n\nNelson\n\nYou're 23 years old?\n\nGillespie\n\nI'm 23 years old. He ran for Chairman of the House Republican Conference and challenged the sitting conference chair and won that. Then I became spokesman and policy and communications director for the House Republicans in the minority. That was in '93 and that's when we came up with the Contract with America.\n\nI can't remember what question started that, but all that to say the experience working for Dick Armey was really informative. Oh, and it deepened my free market principles--my instincts were all there but it gave me a deeper intellectual underpinning for it.\n\nNelson\n\nDuring your time in Armey's office, George H. W. Bush was Vice President. They just called him George Bush back then.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nClearly he was gearing up to run for President. His son George W. was involved in some ways in that campaign. What kind of Texas connection is there between Armey and the Bushes?\n\nGillespie\n\nNone, there really wasn't. Vice President Bush did an event for Armey in '84, but they were from completely different orbits. There really wasn't much of a connection, to be honest with you.\n\nNelson\n\nSo when the elder Bush was running for President, it's not awkward that a Congressman, a prominent Republican Congressman from Texas, is not supporting him or supporting him--Armey had to make a decision about how to relate to that.\n\nGillespie\n\nArmey supported him.\n\nNelson\n\nThrough the nomination?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure he did. I'm trying to remember in '88 who challenged--\n\nNelson\n\nIt was [Robert] Dole, [Jack] Kemp, Pierre DuPont.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, right, whom I was enamored by. I thought Pete DuPont was actually the most exciting of our candidates. He was talking about Social Security reform back then.\n\nMilkis\n\nSomebody like Kemp must have been--\n\nGillespie\n\nArmey was close to Kemp. But I don't think he got involved in the primary. It may have been hard for him because he was close to Kemp, but at the same time George Bush was a Texan and the Texas delegation was strongly behind him, I'm sure.\n\nNelson\n\nSo it clearly wasn't a big deal.\n\nGillespie\n\nNo. It's not like they were trying to get Armey's endorsement or anything. At that time he was a second-term Member, so his endorsement wouldn't have mattered much.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you meet George W. at any point while you were with Armey?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I met [J. Danforth] Quayle. Armey became the Ranking Member on the Joint Economic Committee and I was his staff director. That was in'88. I worked a little bit with some of the folks in the White House, providing economic data to make the case for the President's agenda. Tony Snow, in particular, and I developed--I had known Tony when he was the editorial page editor at the Detroit News and then when he became a speechwriter. He and I had a little bit of a relationship. I would send him reports and studies from the Joint Economic Committee to work into the President's speeches and things like that.\n\nThere was a group. Billy Pitts, who was Bob Michel's floor marshal, had put together folks to work with the legislative affairs people at the White House, but I don't recall meeting President Bush until he was former President Bush 41.\n\nNelson\n\nAnd you never met the son? You never met George W.?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I was pretty far down the food chain for all of that.\n\nPerry\n\nYou were mentioning the run-up to the Contract with America, how exciting it was to be in Congressman Armey's office and that you were meeting Newt Gingrich and Vin Weber. Would you talk a little bit about that?\n\nMilkis\n\nWere you actually in the Conservative Opportunity Society? I've always been fascinated by that.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, there was a change in mindset, a different mentality, among the younger Members. The term was \"crumbs at the table.\" You know, we shouldn't accept crumbs at the table in exchange for supporting the majority's bills. We had a little something, we need to present an alternative vision and we need to fight for our principles. I was very involved on the conservative staff front; in fact, I ran meetings of conservative staff on the House side. I was very deeply involved.\n\nI came up through the conservative movement. I went to Paul Weyrich's lunches and to Grover's [Norquist] meetings, and at the Heritage Foundation. Armey was really in the center of all of that. I liked the Bob Michel people. I liked Bob Michel a lot, still do, and Billy Pitts and his folks. But at the same time there was a generational shift that was going on. I knew which side of that shift I was on. Newt was a very dynamic force of nature as the Whip. So yes, I don't want to exaggerate because you're a staffer and everything, but I was in the thick of all of that.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you think that you were in somewhat the minority tradition?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you sense it was as close in time as it turned out to be?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, not at that point. Although I remember going--when Armey was conference chairman, and he was elected conference chairman after President Bush lost and President [William J.] Clinton was elected. Armey did challenge President Bush pretty head-on about the tax, the compromise out at Andrews Air Force base, and I was in the middle of that, very much so.\n\nNelson\n\nThe 1990 budget.\n\nGillespie\n\nExactly.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were at Andrews?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, but I was selling Armey's no new taxes resolution in the House Republican conference. Michel and Jerry Lewis, who was then the conference chairman, didn't want that resolution and neither did the White House. We pushed it very hard and Armey was at the center of that; it was his resolution. It created a pretty big fracture in the conference, and that was that generational divide that you saw. So when Clinton won, part of the backlash was that Armey beat Lewis, who was the first--you all probably know better or have better access to it, but I'm pretty sure he was the first challenger to a sitting Member of the leadership to win a contested leadership election since [John] Jay Rhodes beat somebody else for the same job, conference chairmanship, which would have been in the '60s I think. So it had been a long time since a sitting Member of the leadership lost a leadership challenge. It just wasn't done back then. You didn't even bring a challenge back then. Armey won by four votes.\n\nIt was a very sophisticated campaign. It was also the first outside campaign. It involved Roll Call and the Wall Street Journal editorial page and others--We tried to shape it--outside groups, the antitax coalition, and others.\n\nRiley\n\nNorquist?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, and the Heritage Foundation. They were kind of putting pressure on Members. Armey got two-thirds of that big--because even though Clinton won, we picked up seats. I think there were about 37 freshman Republicans in that class and I'd say Armey probably got about 27 of those votes. That's what put him over the top. So that challenge was the rift with then President Bush, but that's when he rose to the leadership.\n\nAs for when we sensed the majority, we sensed it early. I remember feeling like there was something going on and we were going to build on that because the [Ross] Perot voters were our voters really. It wasn't clear initially, but that was definitely the case. As I mention in my book, I'd actually seen a profile of Frank Luntz, who was Ross Perot's pollster in that Presidential campaign. One of the things I thought as a young operative was that we've got to get to the Perot voters, they need to be with us, not with President Clinton in these debates. I reached out to Frank and asked him to come and speak to the House Republican retreat, which was at Salisbury, Maryland, and he did. I've joked since that I created a monster.\n\nBut it was useful information and some pretty good insights about the Perot voters, and they did end up being absorbed into the Republican Party. What I was leading to, I remember going to a Roll Call editorial board visit with Armey in April of 1994 and him predicting we were going to take the House in November. They all but laughed him out of the room at that point, but there was a growing sense among the leaders that there's something going on here. President Clinton badly botched his first year in office, I would say.\n\nMilkis\n\nMost political scientists agree.\n\nGillespie\n\nSo there was a sense of we can do this. There was this really interesting mix of leaders who had come together at that point on the Republican side. Armey and Newt, they had really become a nucleus at that point; John Kasich and Bill Paxon and Tom DeLay. There was a real cohesiveness and a real sense of energy and tirelessness. So we were early to the party in terms of thinking that we could win the House.\n\nJones\n\nYou really had created something during that time, I mean this group that we're talking about, and you had created something that was more than just a regular organization. It was an organization. It was a structure that had this kind of energy. The feeling, and we observed it at the time, was of something moving that was more than just the minority and the whole notion of the permanent minority, which had come to be pretty familiar to us looking at it from the outside.\n\nGillespie\n\nWell, it was a new way of thinking. Again, Gingrich deserves a great deal of the credit for this because he fostered that mentality. All of the leadership offices up to that point in the minority were fiefdoms, the conference that served Jerry Lewis. Bob Michel's staff served Bob Michel. And Newt fostered a no borders kind of mentality; the staffs were almost interchangeable. I mean, there were times when I would staff Newt on something if Tony Blankley couldn't. That was just the way it was. They really tried to minimize the infighting and that kind of thing with the leadership staff and the Members themselves. It was cause-driven, which helps.\n\nJones\n\nRight.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt was a sense of something bigger than ourselves. There was a vision. You had all the training of the military experts who would come in, and the retired generals and those types of people. It was half bullshit but it was half real. It did foster this sense of we're comrades in arms and we need to try to get this done. It was a very interesting time. Then the Contract with America, the first hundred days, the shutdown, all of that. The bonds I have with those folks--I just lost one of my comrades in arms in Tony Blankley a week ago or so. I wrote a little piece in the National Review about it. Tony was at the center of it. It was a unique kind of mentality. The truth is, once we got the majority and we'd had the majority for a while, that all dissipated. It kind of fell back into the fiefdoms.\n\nMilkis\n\nBecause?\n\nGillespie\n\nI think there's a dynamic to it; we had achieved the cause. There's a difference between trying to wrest the majority control and trying to keep it. There's just a different kind of mentality.\n\nMilkis\n\nOne thing that does seem to endure is the polarization that grew out of this. I was struck when I read in your book how you're a little ambivalent about how that happened, whether people like Armey and Gingrich caught a wave that was growing, developing in the country, or whether they were important independent factors of that polarization.\n\nGillespie\n\nWere they cause or effect?\n\nMilkis\n\nYes.\n\nGillespie\n\nAs with anything like that, a little bit of both, certainly Newt, even more so I think than Armey. I think Newt is more polarizing than Armey was then. Also, when you're a change agent that tends to be part of--it's inherent. I do think that politics has become more polarized. The distance between Bill Clinton and Third Way, and former President Bush 41 and a Thousand Points of Light is not anywhere near the distance between President [Barack] Obama's agenda and whoever emerges as our nominee today. So things have diverged. The left and the right have gotten further apart. I think maybe that's a natural progression in some ways. We're a young country, obviously still, and it has gotten to that point in other countries sooner.\n\nFrom my perspective I don't think it has to be caustic and I don't think it has to be mean, and I do worry about that in the House a little bit. The other thing is the precision of redistricting contributes to that. There are, believe me, a lot more Members, as you know, who are more afraid of losing a primary than a general election; that's just the nature of it. That pulls both sides. Then I think the campaign finance laws have contributed to it.\n\nI think a perverse impact of the McCain-Feingold Act--and I said this as party chairman; I believed it then and I believe it now--is that the parties actually have an ameliorating effect on some of that polarization. Partisan has such a negative connotation but the parties themselves--When I was party chairman I campaigned for Arlen Specter; he was our nominee. We put money into Pennsylvania, but Club for Growth isn't going to do that. So that exacerbates it, the fact that we've ended up putting more influence and impact in the political process in the ideologically driven groups as opposed to the party campaigns, the party apparatus.\n\nJones\n\nCould I go back to the Contract a bit? Did you travel some during that time with Armey or with Gingrich?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, but we had a daily phone call while they were traveling. It was Newt, Armey, Paxon, and DeLay on the call. They were all around the country. They would call in and compare notes. The staff would be on the call, but as a congressional staffer I was camped out in the Longworth Building on the seventh floor. It was kind of the command center of all of that. Newt's office and our office, the staff offices, at that point were right next to each other, before we moved into the Capitol.\n\nJones\n\nWere there a lot of meetings with the staffs during this time?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, there was pretty constant interaction. They were calling in and saying, \"You won't believe the crowd here in Michigan, people are so fired up.\" You could just sense it on the calls. It was growing. It was getting bigger as the calls went on.\n\nJones\n\nDid you bring in people?\n\nGillespie\n\nHaley Barbour had agreed to underwrite the Contract with America and he put staff in the RNC building. Barry Jackson, who is now the Speaker's chief of staff, and Bob Schellhas, he and I wrote the Contract, the book, together. The NRCC [National Republican Congressional Committee] had staff out in the field, obviously, but not much staff, but those two in particular handled the Contract, media requests about the Contract, background papers on the Contract.\n\nJones\n\nI'm just trying to put a profile together of Ed Gillespie making connections with party people, with others, with--\n\nGillespie\n\nThat didn't really happen until I went to the RNC for Haley, that's when I made my connections and contacts with the party people out in the real world outside of Washington.\n\nJones\n\nI understand, but it sounds like it was starting just by the nature of the project you were working on, the Contract.\n\nGillespie\n\nA little bit, but it was all Washington-centric. I got to know state party chairs and that kind of thing more when I went to work for Haley, which was not long after. That was '96.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you make a decision at some point that you didn't want to be a House guy anymore, that you wanted to get into Presidential politics? National party?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I never really did. In fact, when Haley approached me to go to work for the RNC I was a little reticent, although I was ready to do something different. I had been with Dick Armey for ten years and that's a good run for anybody on the Hill, and I liked Haley a lot. He was in a lot of our meetings. As party chairman he operated and functioned a lot like a staff guy, and he knew all the staff by name. When he was in a meeting where I was, as a staffer, and kind of a political staffer, it felt good that Haley was there. But I was worried at that point even about the RNC trying to salvage the Dole campaign, which I thought was probably going to be an uphill climb and that we would lose the House. I was pretty explicit about what would happen if it came down to having to choose between putting chips into the Electoral College or saving the House, the majority. He was pretty explicit that he would not let the House majority go under to try to save a campaign that couldn't win.\n\nJones\n\nInteresting.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen were you having that kind of conversation?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt was probably November or December of '95.\n\nNelson\n\nSo that far out you thought that--\n\nGillespie\n\nWell, I was a House guy, to your point. I didn't want to go somewhere--I wanted to have a sense that he had a commitment to the House, which he did. I didn't know it would come to that, but it did eventually. By the way, Senator Dole, who has become a good friend--I shouldn't say a friend; he's someone I admire immensely and have gotten to know very well--but he saved the House.\n\nIf you look at Bob Dole's itinerary for the last week of his Presidential campaign, those were not Electoral College stops. He was trying to crank up Republicans to save House seats. I was thinking it would be interesting to go to work for Haley Barbour and the RNC, but the truth is, never in my career have I thought, Well, if I do this, will it result in that? It was more that would be an important place to be in a Presidential year. It would be a good experience. I learned more from Haley Barbour in one year at the RNC than I learned in 12 years of school and four years of college. I mean, the guy is a genius. That was a very formative moment for me as well, and that was really my introduction to national politics as opposed to the national media, where I had already been operating.\n\nJones\n\nHe came to you?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, he came to me.\n\nJones\n\nHow did that go?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt came through Don Fierce.\n\nJones\n\nHe said get over here; I want to talk to you.\n\nGillespie\n\nChuck Greener, who was my predecessor there and ran communications for the RNC for Haley, had decided he was going to leave. I didn't know that. Then Don Fierce, who was kind of Haley's confidant and right-hand man, pulled me aside after one of our meetings and said, \"Chuck Greener is going to leave the RNC.\" I said, \"That's a shame, he's really good.\" He said, \"Would you consider going to work for Haley?\"\n\nI was kind of surprised, I was shocked, and I said, \"Gosh, I don't know.\" I wasn't looking or anything. I said, \"I need to think about it. What's the job?\" They also made it communications and congressional relations. So I was not only in charge of communications but also in charge of the interaction with the Senate and House leadership, which was interesting to me as well.\n\nJones\n\nWith Armey?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, with Haley. The RNC had always had a Congressional Affairs office that would deal with the Members and the staff up there, and they rolled them into one. So I had Congressional Affairs and Communications. I thought about it. It was hard to leave Dick Armey. I was very close to him and very loyal to him. But then I thought we're cause-driven, this is the right place to go and be. It was hard to leave Armey but it turned out, obviously, to be a very important decision for me in my career, and it was a good one.\n\nMilkis\n\nI'm curious about how you made that switch to Barbour. I have great admiration for him, but you learned a lot about party organization and strategy in the House and with the Contract with America and the '94 campaign. What did you learn when you got to the RNC under Barbour? What was the value added? What kinds of lessons did you learn there you did not learn--\n\nPerry\n\nIf I could just add, especially in communications, coming from the campaign for the Contract with America and then coming to a communications position with the RNC. You said you learned so much in that year but then communications becomes such a major part of your portfolio as you go on even ultimately to the White House.\n\nGillespie\n\nOne was data and understanding the importance of polling data and how to read it and how to read through it, analyze it, break out cross tabs [cross tabulation tables], look for pointers, and things like that.\n\nMilkis\n\nThat's old school now, cross tabs.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt's still really important. I learned a lot from Haley in that regard. He could chew through a poll in ten minutes and highlight--there's an aberration here, we need to drill down on this, and focus groups and things like that, that aspect of the communication. I was shooting bullets more than making bullets and it was good to learn how bullets are made.\n\nThen the other thing is the significant impact of paid media. The Contract with America was all earned media, with the only exception being the ad in--\n\nNelson\n\nReaders' Digest.\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, in TV Guide, two weeks before the election. So the importance of paid media and its impact, placement of it, tying it to earned media. I remember one of the things that frustrated Haley about the Dole campaign was that there didn't seem to be a connection between what the Senator was saying in terms of his speeches and what his message of the day was and what the ads were, and trying to tie those things together.\n\nI worked pretty closely with some of Dole's people, more at the end, as things worked out. It was a tough campaign to work with. It kept the RNC at an arm's length, which was a mistake on their part, I think, for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Haley had control of a lot of money and you're allowed to coordinate with them. But at the end, I got brought in and I got to see more there from the inside of the workings of a Presidential campaign. Not a good one, unfortunately, but I got to see it.\n\nSo that was interesting to me. Also the coalitions and the effect of coalitions and the importance of our allies in the Right to Life community and the antitax movement and the national security side of things. That was back in the days--again, it was pre McCain-Feingold. There was nonfederal money at the RNC.\n\nSo those were some of the things I learned. I learned a lot about leadership of an organization by watching Haley, which served me very well when I became RNC chairman myself, and the importance of staying close to the state chairs and some of the members of the committee, and information flow and those kinds of things. It's hard to quantify, but those are things that come immediately to mind in terms of lessons learned.\n\nJones\n\nHad you had anything to do with a campaign committee in the House?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo. Interestingly enough, I had never run a campaign. My area of expertise was really communications. I shouldn't say that; I did Andy Ireland's reelection campaign. I went on the campaign staff and I was coordinator of three counties for him. So I had done a congressional campaign, but I had not been the one responsible for making the decision about the buy or what is our attack or that kind of thing. It was actually helpful to see those inner workings.\n\nRiley\n\nI wonder if I could get you to reflect across the decade of the '90s. You talked about the great enthusiasm that came from the Contract period and this really fascinating core of people who were involved in Republican Congressional politics at the time. If you could talk about the relationships among the people who were central to that effort in '94 and then help us understand what happens to those relationships over time, because they sort of fracture. I'd like to get your story on what happened and why it happened.\n\nGillespie\n\nOne, there was an agreement, or this cause-driven mentality, that helped a lot, shaped the dynamic. The other thing is, there were such complementary talents of the different people.\n\nRiley\n\nHow so?\n\nGillespie\n\nNewt was really a visionary. That was important. Armey was policy, steeped in policy, really cared about policy. Bill Paxon was a great political mind and specialized in fund-raising and turnout. And Tom DeLay was a great organizational person in terms of the coalitions and the outside groups and working the Members. They all had a niche that dovetailed very nicely. But it's also axiomatic that it's a lot easier to maintain unity in the minority than the majority. It's a lot easier for us all to say, \"No, we're not for that.\" It's harder to say, \"Here's the bill we have to pass, we need 218 votes.\" So that was a factor.\n\nIt has been written and it's true, Newt's leadership as Speaker was mercurial. It was fractious. It could just flat wear you out sometimes. One day we would be like, \"We're going to take this hill, this is the ditch we're going to die in,\" and the next day it was, \"Anybody who thinks that that's the hill to take is an idiot and you're out.\" The Members got whipsawed. It was hard to hold the troops together at that point.\n\nArmey had a great line at one point about his working so closely with Newt, especially in the minority when Newt was Whip and he was conference chairman, and through the Contract with America and all that. He said, \"Newt and I agreed to set our egos aside. I set aside Newt's and he set aside mine.\" [laughter] But when you're in the majority for a while, the egos do tend to come more into play. It just became harder and harder to maintain that unity. It's one of the reasons, actually, that by '96, even though it was hard to leave Armey, I was ready to leave the House leadership. It was not a happy, joyous place to be like it was in the minority. So I think those are probably the most significant contributing factors.\n\nOur majority then was a little more diverse than it is even today. Swing seats used to swing between moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans; they now tend to swing between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. We had more moderate Republicans in the conference back then. Partly because of where I grew up and where I came from, I somehow ended up being the liaison to the moderates in the conference. I understood where they were coming from and I understood Bobby Franks' district is a lot different from Dick Armey's district.\n\nBut it was hard. There was constant kind of--then you get to the point where Members can leverage their votes. They won't vote for it unless you do this. It's just tough; it's a draining thing to be the congressional majority, House majority in particular.\n\nJones\n\nAnother factor of course is that the President was not a Republican.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, and the fights over the shutdown were grueling. We made some tactical mistakes. The Clinton White House was good. As I said in my book, they were speaking English, we were speaking math. That's not good. That's one of the things I learned. We're talking about $1.6 trillion and reducing the rate of growth to 3 percent instead of 5 percent and they're talking about Medicare and your elderly mother and streams and dirty water. That's not a good matchup.\n\nThe shutdown was a tough time, but we got through all that. The House Republican conference got through all that. It was more the second term. The welfare deal was good; it helped Clinton, but it was a good bill. It was really after that. I was gone by then but that's when things really started to unravel. They built to that point but they unraveled, the coup and everything.\n\nNelson\n\nIt looks like your leap to Presidential politics took place with the Kasich campaign in early '99, but I wonder if there is anything in the intervening years, the time with Haley Barbour's policy impact communications firm that you were part of.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nIs there anything in that period that bears on development, on the George W. Bush campaign?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, not really. In fact, if anything, that was kind of a hiatus for me. It was my first introduction to business, serving clients and the lobbying side of things and the communication side of things, and really making money for the first time in my life. I had young children. I was trying to fill up college funds. I guess that was almost a three-year period of a hiatus.\n\nThen Kasich, who's a good friend and someone I like a lot--we have very similar backgrounds if you look at where John Kasich comes from and where I come from. We have similar personalities in some ways, although I have a dimmer switch and John only has an on-and-off switch. [laughter] He decided that he was going to make a run. We had an open field. There was no--it's not like Dole was coming back or Kemp. It was wide open. I liked John's ability to connect with blue-collar voters and the middle class. I liked how he talked about free market policies and lifting people out of poverty. The most formative book for me, in terms of my view of the world, is Michael Novak's The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, which is kind of a Catholic take on the importance of free markets and free people in terms of fulfilling ourselves.\n\nJones\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nGillespie\n\nAnyway, that's kind of where Kasich is intuitively, and I liked him and we were pretty friendly. All the folks were signing up with then Governor Bush. I didn't really have a connection to Governor Bush or his people. I didn't know him. To me, like I said, it's a lot about loyalty, and I thought Kasich would be good for the party. I didn't kid myself that he was going to be the first House Member to get elected since, was it [Chester] Arthur or, no, [Rutherford B.] Hayes. I thought it would be good to go out there and do Iowa, New Hampshire, and we did. Kasich can really crank them up; he can crank up a crowd. There are times when he's just electric. So that was pretty neat. But we realized we couldn't get there from here.\n\nBush himself was really in that similar niche then, the compassionate conservative niche was what he was talking about, communities. So it's not like we were contrasting with--he would become the frontrunner pretty quickly. We were right there in his slot. You can't be there in the frontrunner's slot as a House Member, so he decided to get out. I wanted him to stay through the debates. I thought if people saw Kasich in the debates it would be good for him. He didn't want to do it and we were out of money. I don't even think I got paid, by the way. So he could have cut my salary in half.\n\nThen he decided he was going to leave Congress as well. So I said, \"Let's do it big; don't just get out, do something positive. Who do you like?\" We had been a part of then Governor Bush's meeting folks; he had invited Kasich down to Austin and I went with John. That was the first time I met Karl Rove, although my wife knew him. Karl had done Joe Barton's campaign and Cathy [Gillespie] was Joe's campaign manager. She really headed up Aggies for Barton at Texas A&M University.\n\nJones\n\nYour wife, to make it clear.\n\nGillespie\n\nMy wife, yes. So we met there.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen was this?\n\nGillespie\n\nThis was in '99, so it was before everything was really getting started. Bush was not in yet. Kasich wasn't in yet but he was nosing around. They had a good breakfast. I was there for the breakfast. It was the Governor and Karl and Kasich and me. It was interesting. So I said, \"Bush is really where you are. He's the one talking about things you're talking about.\" We agreed that he would endorse him.\n\nI called Karen Hughes, whom I didn't know, and we arranged for the event at the Reagan Building in Washington. They were both going to be in Washington at the same time. That's when Kasich announced that he was abandoning his plan to run for President, shutting down the exploratory committee, he was leaving Congress, his wife was pregnant with twins, and he was endorsing George W. Bush for President. It was good. He was the first domino to fall and to get behind Bush, so it was kind of a significant event.\n\nMilkis\n\nThey put on the caps.\n\nGillespie\n\nThey put on the baseball caps, which I thought--\n\nMilkis\n\nThat was your idea, right?\n\nGillespie\n\nThat was my idea. I thought both of them could pull it off; not everybody can. So I suggested that to Karen and she thought it was a good idea. She thought it was kind of fun and would be a good picture. So they had Bush campaign caps, and Kasich said, \"I'm glad to be on your team now,\" and they put on the caps. It was a good shot. It conveyed youthfulness. [Albert, Jr.] Gore couldn't wear a baseball cap.\n\nMilkis\n\nMaybe backward.\n\nGillespie\n\nCathy told Karl that he should get to know her husband, he should get him involved. I stayed neutral after Kasich got out. I did a lot of TV and that kind of thing.\n\nNelson\n\nWhy did you stay neutral?\n\nGillespie\n\nMy heart wasn't in anywhere. I thought Bush was probably going to be our nominee and I thought he'd be fine. I was kind of intrigued by [John] McCain.\n\nRiley\n\nYou had breakfast with him; you didn't say much about your breakfast.\n\nGillespie\n\nHe served bacon, which was funny to me because later, when I met him at the event--I came in with Kasich and Bush came in with Maria Cino, we were friends. I remember he went up to him and said, \"John, thanks for doing this.\" Kasich said, \"Happy to do it, George.\" They talked a little bit and Kasich said, \"This is Eddie Gillespie, he's been helping me.\" I remember Bush saying, \"I've met Eddie, I served him bacon at my house,\" which I thought was pretty remarkable. I was struck by that. Bush probably didn't remember; it was probably in a briefing book somewhere, but it was very good. It was really good.\n\nRiley\n\nBut what were your impressions of him from breakfast?\n\nGillespie\n\nI thought he was really interesting. Karl didn't say anything.\n\nMilkis\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nGillespie\n\nThat was very opposite the public perception.\n\nMilkis\n\nThe dog that didn't bark.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, I spoke more than Karl did. I didn't really think much of it. I was just there with Kasich, and there were questions and there were answers I had. John would pull me into the conversation sometimes. I didn't overdo it. I thought he was very gregarious. Kasich took umbrage because he, the President, even then had the propensity to dub people with nicknames and he called him Johnny-boy, which Kasich did not like.\n\nMilkis\n\nA slap on the back?\n\nGillespie\n\nBut it was good conversation. He was probing in his questions about the federal budget. He was drilling down with John on that. Then he took us on a tour of the Governor's mansion in Austin, which is a remarkable place, a lot of history. He was nice. In addition to me, we had a driver, Chris [indecipherable]. He was nice to Chris. I left with a very favorable impression.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you didn't fall in love with him at the time?\n\nGillespie\n\nI didn't, I wasn't in the mood to. I wasn't looking--I just wanted to get back to my business. I thought that this is all going to sort itself out. Then Cathy put me in touch with Karl. I started to email him and have some thoughts. Then I started feeling like, I think that's who I like. It's kind of a process you go through. I had concerns about Senator McCain as our nominee.\n\nBush won Iowa--I remember realizing, Kasich and I were in Iowa when Bush came into Iowa for the first time. I'm on a commercial flight on the tarmac waiting to take off and I'm tired. John is nocturnal. I'm on an 8:30 flight and I'm tired and I'm leaning my head against the window. I think it was about 10:00 by the time the Bush--a 767 comes in with all the media, they're dropping cameras out of the belly of the thing. And John and I were just driving around in an SUV [sport utility vehicle] with two reporters every once in a while following along. I thought, This is over.\n\nSo I started thinking that's probably where I am, that's who I'm for. I like what he says, I like his approach. Then he lost New Hampshire. People were thinking he's not going to be the nominee after all; McCain is going to win. The day after New Hampshire I emailed Karl and the folks who send out the talking points and I said, \"I'm for Governor Bush. The next time I'm asked to go on television I'm going to say I'm not a neutral observer anymore; I now consider myself a Bush supporter. If I can be helpful to you in any way, let me know.\"\n\nThey hadn't gotten many emails like that that day and Karl really appreciated it. So then I started lobbing in some thoughts from time to time. He was always responsive.\n\nNelson\n\nKarl was.\n\nGillespie\n\nKarl was. Then when the Governor had all but clinched the nomination they needed to have the echo chamber in Washington, the establishment folks. They needed to get us inside the tent peeing out, not outside peeing in. So he asked Haley Barbour and Mary Matalin and Bill Paxon and Vin Weber and Charlie Black and me to serve as an informal advisory group in Washington, D.C. They called us the group of six but it became the Gang of Six.\n\nMilkis\n\nDid the media call--?\n\nGillespie\n\nI think Karl started it. For me to be with Haley Barbour and Mary Matalin and Bill Paxon and Vin Weber and Charlie Black, was--that was me and them. To be in that group was very flattering to me.\n\nMy task was to look at the research on Gore; they had a lot on him. I was struck in going through it by how many times in the open-ended questions people would say he's wishy-washy. Can't take a stand. He flip-flops. I was struck by that. I did a memo on it and I sent it to Karl and said, \"I think there's something that we need to pursue here.\"\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you say the research on Gore, do you mean focus groups?\n\nGillespie\n\nFocus groups, but also quantitative as well, but with open-ended questions. So when you would ask the question, \"What do you think of when you think about Gore?\" they would say that.\n\nMilkis\n\nYou thought it was going to be that he was arrogant.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, I thought it was going to be arrogant, elite, elitist, that sort of thing. I was struck by the wishy-washy responses. So we hit him on that. We did it more to [John] Kerry four years later, but it's interesting that we were on that with Gore. They found that valuable. I was going on the shows then as, not a surrogate, I wasn't an official surrogate for them, but I was a Bush supporter. I think they liked what they saw down in Austin, so then they asked me to do the convention. That was really where I got knee-deep in it. They liked what we did on the convention. I worked with Andy Card there; he was the chairman of it and I was his number-two man.\n\nIt was a huge undertaking because they were very behind the curve. Literally, when I went up there on June 9, I think it was, they didn't have the person to say the Pledge of Allegiance on Monday night. We had to go through all of that, the speakers and everything. It was grueling. I would get into my office in Philadelphia at 7:30 in the morning and I would be there until 10 o'clock at night, eating cheesesteaks at my desk.\n\nNelson\n\nHow did you know what were the nuts and bolts, the things that needed to be accomplished at a convention?\n\nGillespie\n\nI didn't. It wasn't really my job. My job was more the messaging, what are we trying to convey? The imagery. There are others who do the nuts-and-bolts stuff; there's a whole infrastructure for that that's permanent.\n\nMilkis\n\nSo you weren't choosing the speakers or--\n\nGillespie\n\nI was choosing the speakers; I was recommending the speakers. Karen would sign off on that.\n\nMilkis\n\nThat's part of the message.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, but there were times that she was so busy, she was swamped. I started signing off. I thought I'd rather get fired because they don't like the speaker than to have hand puppets for a half an hour one night because we didn't get the speakers signed off. They liked that. They appreciated it. They'd come back and say, \"I'm not sure we want this person\" and I'd say, \"It's too late, I've already invited him. I'm sorry.\" They were like, that's OK, it will work.\n\nThen the convention was over. We had a really good convention.\n\nMilkis\n\nCould you tell us real quickly what message did you think was--?\n\nGillespie\n\nDifferent kind of Republican was the theme of that convention, and we conveyed it in a lot of different ways. It was very diverse, which was a conscious decision. I remember Kevin Merida, who is a friend in the media whom I happen to like, said, \"It looks to me like you're trying to feature African Americans and Hispanics and Asian Americans.\" I said, \"That's right, we are. If you're accusing me of trying to increase our share of the black and Hispanic and Asian American vote, guilty as charged. I'd like to have more diversity on the floor, but we only get 10 percent of the African American vote and not a large percentage of them are going to come to a convention for four days. But we want it and yes, we're trying to send that message.\"\n\nWe had a black gospel choir close us out on the first night; it was great.\n\nMilkis\n\nYou had Herb Lusk, the former running back for the Eagles.\n\nGillespie\n\nHerb Lusk, yes.\n\nMilkis\n\nCan I back you up a little bit? Did you ever find out how that Gang of Six was constituted? I mean, you were working with Haley at the same firm. Did he say you have to include--?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I don't think he did, I think it was Karl. That was all Karl's doing. I don't know--I married way over my head, and he always loved Cathy and thought Cathy was very sharp, which she is. I think he thought, If that guy is smart enough to marry Cathy, I should get him involved. Then two, I think the interactions that we had, limited though they were--and I think he felt, all those folks, the other five folks that I mentioned, are stellar people. But I also think he thought we needed the next generation down to be in the mix too, and I'm a generation behind them.\n\nNelson\n\nYou and Matalin, I guess, were--\n\nGillespie\n\nMary, although Mary was a very prominent figure. She essentially ran the RNC when Lee [Atwater] got sick in the reelect. I always admired her from afar because she went down swinging. A lot of people abandoned President Bush in that campaign, and she went down swinging. I said this the other night, which is the reason it's fresh in my mind, because she and I were in New Orleans at the same time. I was in New Orleans for the RNC meeting and I was honored at a dinner for former RNC chairmen, Frank Fahrenkopf and I, and Mary came because she lives there. She said some really over-the-top things about me, which really touched me. I had admired Mary Matalin from afar for a long time and she was a star. I think [James] Carville, Matalin, American Express ads, she's famous. I just love her. As I got to know her I knew that she's a genuinely good person. It's nice when someone you admire from afar turns out to be even better up close. That's how I feel about Mary.\n\nWe're not that far apart in age. I'm 50; Mary, I can't guess. She's a little older than I am but she had already cut her teeth. She was there with Charlie and Haley and Bill to a certain extent, and I wasn't. But it was Karl's doing. He was the one who got me into the mix.\n\nRiley\n\nNow that you backed us up, Mike, I do want to ask one other question. I wonder if you could help us understand something about Texas politics. Not on the state level, but you have an extraordinary window through your own experiences and through your wife's experience to help us figure out the relationship of these people and how they're eye-balling national politics. I mean, Armey himself must have had national aspirations at one point, right?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, he thought about it at one point.\n\nRiley\n\nHow does this all play out ultimately? How do these people get along?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt's a big state, that's an understatement. For Republicans, Texas, in terms of the Electoral College base, the money, the size, the persona that it tends to produce, there is--I don't know, Phil Gramm was so dominant for so long. The Bush Governor operation did not really interact with the delegation very much at all. To the extent they did, it was probably through Bill Archer or someone like that. It's like they say, it's like a whole other country. That's just the way you--what you do in Washington is fine, just don't screw with us here and it will work out fine.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's the polite version.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt's not like they're always up there, we're trying to get the superconducting, supercollider, and there's lots of money that goes to UT [University of Texas] and research grants and all that stuff, but the Republican delegation in the House from Texas, it's not a bunch of pork barrelers. They're not people trying to bring money back to Texas. They're really trying to keep Washington out of Texas. So there's not a lot of bumping and grinding that goes on between the figures in Washington and the figures back home. If you look, in terms of the Texas Governors, you don't see Members of Congress go and run--and when they do, like Kay Bailey Hutchison, they get their heads handed to them.\n\nYou've got to come up from Texas if you're going to be the Governor, and Governors are generally the route to the White House for our party. So I don't think there really is much friction. The Karl/John Weaver dynamic goes back to the political consulting aspect of it. In my experience, every state tends to have two camps of political consultants; that's just the nature. They run against each other in primaries, there's a lot of hard feelings, they're recruiting. They're trying to get their candidate; they're trying to get donors to give. So there's always that kind of friction.\n\nBut in terms of--I mean, Armey and DeLay had a big falling out at the end, but that was proximity. They were side-by-side for a long time. Generally either it doesn't exist as much as we'd like to think or I'm not as privy to it as others who are actually down on the ground in Austin. Karl would have a lot more insight. But there's not a lot of that dynamic that I actually saw up close.\n\nRiley\n\nSo there wasn't any sense of resentment toward W. Bush as a young upstart coming in and using Austin as a platform for--\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, he was a popular Governor and a conservative Governor. Armey--again, they weren't friendly and they were from different orbits--but Armey didn't have any animus toward him. I remember he called the office one time. It was a big deal; the Governor is calling. I don't know how DeLay felt about him, if there was any friction there, but the rest of the delegation, I don't think--and I don't know about Phil Gramm's relationship, although my impression is that it's actually pretty good.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember when it first became plausible to you that this person might have fruitful Presidential aspirations? It's not the Bush that everybody expected.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, we thought Jeb [Bush]. I remember being at lunch, again with a reporter who was a friend, Tom Galvin, who was at the New York Daily News at the time. We were talking about it; I can't remember what year it was. It was probably after the midterm, '98. I remember him saying that George W. Bush, he's the one--and I thought, Really? I hadn't even thought about it. Then Haley was for him when I was for Kasich. I said, \"Why are you for him?\" I didn't get it.\n\nI know we'll get to it by the way, but let me just say it right now, I love George W. Bush. But I didn't get it at the time. Given where I was with Armey at the time and everything, I wasn't a big admirer of 43. I am now. I think he's a class act and a really good person. But where I came from, that wasn't my thing. Kasich was more--\n\nI remember Haley saying, \"It's cold outside and we need to get inside and this guy is going to get us inside. He's a good guy.\" Haley had dealt with him because Haley worked closely with the Governors as RNC chairman. I respected Haley's opinion obviously. Haley saw the timber there that others didn't. He was in early for him. So somewhere in that time frame. Then, as I say, I was watching him on the stump and I would watch him in the campaign. I remember thinking, It's a really good operation; he's a good candidate. He's somebody I would be comfortable supporting. But as I say, it was a gradual thing.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about McCain? You had said earlier that you didn't--I got the sense that there was a discomfort with the idea of McCain as the nominee.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, I don't know why. It's interesting because--I don't mean to sound self-aggrandizing or anything, because then you get to know these people and you realize he's a really good guy. I just didn't feel like Senator McCain would be a strong nominee for us. I respected his record. I remember even when I was a Bush--I was asked at one point about something negative about McCain, I never said anything negative about McCain. I admired his service and his sacrifice for our country. I didn't agree with him, didn't think he'd be our strongest nominee but I remember saying, I think it was on the air, if not to a reporter, \"If you're looking for somebody to take shots at McCain, you're going to have to call somebody else. I'm for Bush. I think he's the guy, but I didn't spend seven years in a POW [prisoner of war] camp, and he did, and I'm not taking a shot at him.\"\n\nAnyway that was my view; I didn't think he was our strongest nominee.\n\nRiley\n\nI interrupted a line of questions about the convention.\n\nJones\n\nI'd like to go back to the convention.\n\nRiley\n\nSure, go ahead, but I also wanted to follow up with McCain in the sense that here's a Senator. History tells us Senators directly winning the White House, there are damn few to start with and not all that successful. Three of them died in office. So the larger question is of a legislator as President, and to ask you about Kasich. You were attracted to him.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nJones\n\nBut were there characteristics that suggested to you because of his experience, his one experience in the House where he certainly was an important Member of the House and had a lot of battle scars, what would make him a good President?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I wasn't that sophisticated at the time, to be honest with you. I thought he was a great messenger. I liked how he talked about our views. I thought he was forceful and strong and he was a leader. I didn't know as much about the office as I do now. If I did, maybe then I would have thought, Love John, great messenger, but I'm not sure he can be President of the United States. But that's the benefit of experience that I didn't have at the time.\n\nJones\n\nBut if he was thinking--\n\nGillespie\n\nBy the way, I think a term and a half as Governor of Ohio could do that for him.\n\nJones\n\nBut on the convention, with whom did you work mostly?\n\nGillespie\n\nAndy Card, he and I were joined at the hip. But it was really my own shop.\n\nJones\n\nIt's fascinating. I had a former student who used to work with the Democratic Convention and I never could quite get the sense of an organizational structure in putting together the convention. Of course the role of the RNC, as you suggested, is quite structured, it's there and it's permanent.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nJones\n\nBut as far as the in-and-outers and the people who are associated with the campaign coming in, it never was clear to me what the model was, clearing out a hierarchy, maybe it is amoeba-like?\n\nGillespie\n\nThere's a hierarchy to it. There are really two sides organizationally of a convention. One is the internal. You've got 2,000 delegates who have to be in hotels, get from their hotels to the floor. They've got to vote. You've got Governors. All of that. The logistics of a convention is a nightmare. That's a big chunk of it, having enough buses and all of it.\n\nBy the way, a sidenote: a convention should be three days, not four. There's really an anachronistic thing that painfully hurts everybody. It's not good for the host city; it's not good for the parties.\n\nThen there is the external, the outward-facing part, which was really my purview. That is, who's speaking? Colin Powell is going to be our keynoter. Should Laura Bush speak on the first night? Yes, I think she should. Why? Here's why. [Condoleezza] Condi Rice should have a role. We need to highlight the community service aspect, the voluntarism that's part of the compassionate conservatism. There's the Vice President's night, the third night, and then obviously the President's speech. There's the national security night, there's the domestic policy night. You have to get all that.\n\nWhat we wanted to do was to not have a bunch of 20-minute speeches. We wanted to have a whole bunch of three-minute speeches, which was even harder. Then you're moving people on and off the stage. We had two different stages. You want to have entertainment, you want to have music, make it fun. Beach balls, videos, all of that. To fill 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for a convention and also keep the attention of the people in the hall is a real pain in the ass. That was my job. I worked very closely with Andy on it. In all honesty, it was a leap of faith for them to put me in that job. I'd never really had that kind of experience before, but you just get stuff done.\n\nJones\n\nIt occurs to me, and I don't recall, it may be in this Frontline interview, but there was a wonderful phrase that you attributed to somebody else, \"absorbed into the organization.\"\n\nGillespie\n\nThat's Lee Atwater.\n\nJones\n\nOK. It strikes me that very early then, for you, you had to become absorbed--\n\nGillespie\n\nI got absorbed.\n\nJones\n\n--into the campaign structure in that organization.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nJones\n\nIn order to know that this is going to work, that's not going to work, and this is what we're trying to portray. You have to know enough about the candidate and what's acceptable, plus his fingers into the world, all of the others, to come up with the right choices. Is that correct?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt is correct and it's the mark of a good campaign, especially a national campaign, a Presidential campaign. Lee Atwater said the sign of a truly great campaign is that it can absorb unlimited numbers of people.\n\nYou're right, I got absorbed. I remember when I went up to Kennebunkport. Again, this is like a mystical place, Kennebunkport. You hear about it with former President Bush. Then Governor Bush, he and 41 and 41B, the First Lady, and the brothers and Doro [Dorothy Walker Bush Koch] and--they get together as a family up at Kennebunkport once a year. I got a call from Andy Card asking if I could go up to Kennebunkport tomorrow and meet with Karen and Karl, they were all up there. It was in the thick of the campaign, but the Governor rightly deserved some downtime. He wanted to be with his family. So it was my first time to Kennebunkport.\n\nWe moved into a new house that day. If Cathy were here she would correct me and say, \"What do you mean, we? You were in Kennebunkport.\" [laughter] I half expected to come home and see my clothes lying on the front lawn. So that was June of 2000. They laid it out at Jean's--\n\nRiley\n\nBecker?\n\nGillespie\n\nJean Becker's house, at her kitchen table, with Karl and Karen and Andy and me. Here's what we want out of this convention. I absorbed it, and took it back and implemented and executed it.\n\nMilkis\n\nSo the theme was a different kind of Republican.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nMilkis\n\nInteresting.\n\nGillespie\n\nSo that's where I--and I just executed against that. I did have interactions with Karen. Karen was really kind of, the Governor's muse is too strong. But it was hard to get her to get me answers on stuff. That's when I, as I said, just kind of came unglued and said, \"I'm going to do this stuff and if she gets mad at me, fine.\" I'd rather get fired for something I did than something I didn't.\n\nThat said, I also think in the back of her mind is, I told you what we wanted, what are you calling me for?\n\nMilkis\n\nDelegator.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, she was a great delegator. The Governor afterward was thrilled, then Governor Bush, with the convention. He was very nice to me. I got to see him again there. Then he's the nominee and he has the aura and everything. He sent me a very nice handwritten note that I was surprised to get saying you did a fantastic job, thank you very much for all your hard work.\n\nNelson\n\nSo there was no taint because of your association with Armey on the opposite side of the budget fight with his father? You didn't have to get that stain off?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, actually I believe President Bush 43 is actually more intuitively conservative than his father. I'm not sure that he necessarily--Armey was in a different place than Newt. There was a sense of betrayal with Newt because he was in the room. Armey was on the outside saying, \"Don't raise taxes in there.\" So it was a little different.\n\nNelson\n\nRight. Yes, it's a little different.\n\nGillespie\n\nI'm not sure that Bush 43 probably didn't agree that it was a mistake for his father to break that pledge. But on top of that, it's more the mentality. As I say, it's this is a national campaign for President of the United States. If there is a good person--and you can tell if somebody is loyal over time--you show your loyalty and you get further and further inside. They judged right away, rightly, I'm just a loyal person. If I sign up and I'm your guy, I'm your guy. I'm not going to go out and pee on you with reporters on background, I'm just not.\n\nRiley\n\nSid has reminded me that I didn't give you the break I promised. We've got about another hour. Why don't we take three or four minutes and we'll go to six if that's OK with you?\n\nGillespie\n\nGreat.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nMilkis\n\nOne of the things I find most interesting about your career is that you're known as someone who is not that common, who combines gifts with communication with substance, policy, and message. So I'm fascinated by your interest in ideas and how you were attracted to Kasich and compassionate conservatism. I've always been a little curious about what that means and what its relationship is to some of the cause conservatism that was dominant in the House when you were part of that moment.\n\nJones\n\nAnd if I can add, what you understood Bush to mean by it.\n\nGillespie\n\nFrom the process side of things, I was a legislative assistant for Andy Ireland and I wanted to be his press secretary. To me, politics is a means to an end and the end is governing and good policies. It sounds trite and people say it all the time, but I believe it. I think good policies make good politics and good politics lead to good policies. I was the staff director of the Joint Economic Committee. It was a little bit odd in that world, seen as--I don't know if it was seen as, by Armey, to be kind of not taking the job seriously enough. It was established as Congress's answer to the Council of Economic Advisors and it's not, it's a backwater. The Budget Committee overtook it in the Budget Act of 1974 but I liked being the staff director of that committee.\n\nI had 11 PhD economists who worked for me. I was lucky to escape with my undergraduate degree from Catholic U. But I knew how to take what they were saying and to get it out there and sell it. What they were saying was important, that's what I really cared about. Then when we took the chairmanship of the House Conference--I say we; when Armey took it, I was the policy and communications director, both--I felt that's what it's about. I wanted to also be involved in the policy making and I wanted to have the communications side of things and the political thinking about it to factor in the policy-development process as opposed to after the fact, where the policy guys come to you and say, \"Here, go sell this.\" You look at it and you think, Nobody can sell that, that's not going to work. It may work in theory but--\n\nSo I liked being in the mix on the policy development. Then when Armey became majority leader I became policy and communications director to the majority leader, I was involved not just in the selling of the Contract with America, but in the drafting of it. I think that served me well. I think that being able to go, especially with reporters and the media, three or four iterations deep on something just gives you greater credibility.\n\nMilkis\n\nTrue.\n\nGillespie\n\nI have a natural interest in the policy side of it. Part of my business now is giving strategic advice to law firms who are in big, high-profile legal fights. I never went to law school but I shepherded two Supreme Court Justices and I got a pretty good sense of the law in that process.\n\nMilkis\n\nMaybe there's a lesson there about not going to law school.\n\nGillespie\n\nRight. So I think that being steeped in the substance is important and at the end of the day what it's really all about. To me, compassionate conservatism was a brand. It was a smart brand, given where we were with the Republican brand at the end of the '96 campaign, all about slashing spending and all of that. We just never captured it right. So to me compassionate conservatism is, well, welfare reform. The welfare reform bill that was passed by Republicans and signed by President Clinton was a good example, but we didn't really get that bill done until we stopped talking about saving money and started talking about saving families and saving lives. That's when we won the debate on welfare reform.\n\nMilkis\n\nPutting people to work too.\n\nGillespie\n\nPutting people to work. Part of this is infused by--in my mind, John Paul II, in his encyclical on work, talked about the dignity of work. This isn't just about punishing people for their welfare, we have to make them work; there's dignity in work.\n\nI felt, coming from where I came from, that there's dignity in all work. My father stocked shelves and sliced lunchmeat. He was the most dignified man I know. He didn't wear a suit to work. There's dignity in work and we needed to capture that. That's where Kasich was. As I say, to me, compassionate conservatism really is Michael Novak's view, which is that we have to help people. There does need to be a safety net. People meet hard times; they have to be protected. We have to protect people from unethical businesses. That's not to say that businesses are inherently unethical.\n\nTo me, it's helping to let people rise and having a dynamic economy that protects consumers and people but at the same time allows for people to flourish and for upward mobility. And I think too much government stifles that. That is the stagnation we're feeling now; it's because of excessive government spending and regulation that leads to income inequality. There are a number of ways that income inequality can rise. I think it's a mistake for conservatives to argue that income inequality is not a concern; it is a concern.\n\nThe bigger concern is income stagnation. If someone who makes a million dollars has their income go up 10 percent, the gap widens from somebody who makes $50,000 whose income goes up 10 percent. But that's the right problem. That's not our problem right now, so I think we need to--to me, there has been no greater antipoverty program than democratic capitalism. It has lifted millions of people out of poverty. It lifted my father out of poverty. That's why his father brought him to America. He was a janitor. That dynamic economy allowed him to become a salesman for Procter and Gamble and then work in a grocery store, then buy the grocery store, then buy the bar and put six children through college for the first time on either side of the family. That's compassionate conservatism. It's not a laissez-faire fend for yourself, it's a let's foster a society and it's a recognition, apart from the economic side of the political economy, the societal side of it. It also means that those of us who have the benefit of making a good income and creating wealth, that we share that wealth, not necessarily entirely through taxation but through giving back to the community.\n\nI thought Bush captured that, the faith-based initiatives, and the way he talked about government programs. I think that's where his heart was and I think he did a pretty good job of repositioning the party in that regard.\n\nJones\n\nIn a sense it's moving from the problem to the goal. That is to say, not just talking about this is awful, this is awful, but this is what you want to achieve.\n\nGillespie\n\nWe've got some positive vision and I think that's right. As I said, I think Bush did a good job of laying that out. I think we suffer as a party right now. We're not doing as good a job. I thought President Bush's approach to immigration reform was compassionate conservatism. I think his approach to Social Security reform and Medicare reform was compassionate conservatism. It has a bad name right now.\n\nMilkis\n\nOne thing he stressed quite a bit in 2000 was education reform.\n\nGillespie\n\nEducation reform, exactly. You know, \"the soft bigotry of low expectations.\"\n\nMilkis\n\nI love that line.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt's a great line and it captures what was going on and the notion that if you're in an inner-city school and you're trapped there, that's a tough break.\n\nNelson\n\nYou said you loved President Bush; you came to love President Bush.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nHere you talk about what you believe and what you saw in him as one who believes. It surprises me that it took you as long as it did for you to fall in love with him. Why didn't you fall in love with him in--what was holding you back when Kasich withdrew? There must have been something there because he was saying the things that you believed.\n\nGillespie\n\nMaybe it's a reverse elitism to a certain extent. It's one of the things I learned in some ways. I don't have a chip on my shoulder at all about--I'm proud of where I came from, where I'm from. But at the same time I'm not the son of a President and didn't know any sons of Presidents, and I didn't know any sons of Senators or House members or county commissioners for that matter. I didn't go to Yale. So to a certain extent I didn't relate to him. It wasn't a hostility; it was more just not caring.\n\nBut--and I regret that in the same way--President Bush never looked askance at me because I'm the son of an immigrant, I shouldn't have looked askance at him because he's the son of a President. I think that was a factor, it was just part of it. I was wrong about that. There are a lot of people who are born to privilege who are really good people, and just because I wasn't doesn't make me worse, but it doesn't make me better either.\n\nRiley\n\nAnything else on the convention?\n\nNelson\n\nWhat were the high points? What were the things that you felt went really well?\n\nRiley\n\nAnd what didn't work?\n\nGillespie\n\nIt sounds kind of silly but I don't think there was anything that didn't work. I really think it was a ten-strike event. It was just a really good convention. One thing that didn't work was we had confetti go off when Mrs. Bush came on to speak, everyone was excited, and it buried the teleprompter.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is Laura?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, on the first night. So her paddles were blank. All she could see on the paddle was confetti on the teleprompter.\n\nJones\n\nIt's real hard to keep confetti from dropping once it starts.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, that's one of the things we learned. That didn't happen in the '04 convention.\n\nMilkis\n\nSo she did the whole speech extemporaneously?\n\nGillespie\n\nShe started extemporaneously--\n\nMilkis\n\nThen it cleared up?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, we couldn't clear it up but we had a big-screen television at the center of the back of the hall. It was covered with black felt basically, but this was an emergency. We realized we were in an emergency and we ripped off the cover and she picked up her speech.\n\nRiley\n\nLike off a Jumbotron?\n\nGillespie\n\nNot a Jumbotron, it would be more like a--those halls aren't that big. Once you build out the stage and everything, it's not that far to the back of the hall.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nGillespie\n\nSo it was more like a 56-inch TV. But she still turned--when you don't have the advantage of the prompter, she was about two minutes into it before that came up and it was a little harrowing. She never batted an eye. She never stumbled or missed a word. Clinton did that one time with the State of the Union Address.\n\nMilkis\n\nWith health care.\n\nGillespie\n\nShe was really remarkable. But otherwise, in terms of accomplishing what we wanted to get done, it was pretty close to perfect.\n\nNelson\n\nWere the speakers given their speeches? Were their speeches vetted?\n\nGillespie\n\nWe worked with them. There was this whole speechwriting apparatus and so when you--even then, no one was going to hand General Powell a speech and say, \"Here's your speech.\" But you'd sit down and say, \"We'd like to highlight these things.\" In his case I think he wrote it and then there was some back-and-forth. If you remember, Zell Miller wrote his own speech that year, which was pretty fun. That was '04, I guess.\n\nMilkis\n\nYes, '04.\n\nGillespie\n\nIt's a mix. Condi wanted to write her own speech. But there's a speechwriting team and they work it. It has to fit the theme of the night and the segment and all that. So it's a combination--there are some who when you hand it to them they'll go through and edit and hand it back.\n\nMilkis\n\nWere you consulted at all on President Bush's acceptance speech?\n\nGillespie\n\nNo, I wasn't.\n\nJones\n\nTo what extent in preparing and organizing, setting up the convention, is there attention given to the other convention or to the candidate?\n\nGillespie\n\nWell, we went first; they had last licks. There's really not that much. There's not enough time to focus. They're going to say what they're going to say; we're going to say what we're going to say. It's more the other way around. I'm sure they watched what we were doing and they probably responded, but it's hard to anticipate what they might do.\n\nBut in '04 when the President was running for reelection, we got to watch their convention. I was in Boston and we saw the points that they were trying to hit and we wanted to knock those down or address those, take away some of the strength that they had gained out of Boston.\n\nNelson\n\nDid I hear you say earlier that four nights was one night too many?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nWhy?\n\nGillespie\n\nYou just can't keep the attention span anymore of the media or the people back home or even the delegates. It's a foregone conclusion. I think that will be the case for the Republicans this time, but maybe not. You can get everything done in three days. There's a one-day session on Monday and then the Monday night session and then Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night; it's just too much.\n\nJones\n\nDo you have any influence, or try to have any influence, on what the various channels or networks are going to cover?\n\nGillespie\n\nThat's a little bit of a back-and-forth kind of thing. You try to push them to cover certain things. But as you know, the nets [network television stations] don't take it anymore; the cables [cable television stations] do. The nets will take the Wednesday night 10:00 to 11:00 slot and the Thursday night 10:00 to 11:00 slot, which is another reason not to do it in four nights.\n\nJones\n\nI think people have forgotten that they did not cover Barack Obama's speech that sort of launched him. The nets didn't cover him at all.\n\nGillespie\n\nIn Boston.\n\nJones\n\nRight, quite astonishing.\n\nRiley\n\nSome people watched it on cable TV.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, they watch it on YouTube, they watch it many different ways. It's kind of a given now. And the cables are going to talk; they talk over the speakers. It's just constant chattering. In a lot of ways it's a waste of time.\n\nNelson\n\nOn the absorbing people line of inquiry, Bush chooses [Richard] Cheney to be Vice President.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nCan you talk about that? Integrating Cheney into the campaign, et cetera?\n\nGillespie\n\nThe first I heard about it was actually early in Philadelphia, not the week of the convention, but I was dealing with some of the folks. I remember being out to dinner with a couple of people from the campaign and that was the first I heard it. I was like, \"What?\"\n\nNelson\n\nHeard it before it was public?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes. Some of his folks came in, like Dirk Vande Beek, who worked with him at Halliburton, but I think everybody else was pretty much assigned to him. Kathleen Harrington was assigned to him. He's kind of his own operative. His family and Mrs. [Lynne] Cheney, to a certain extent, staff him. He doesn't need much staffing. He's very sharp and knows policy and everything. But in terms of the campaign, that was the role--the Cheney announcement was flawed. It hurt us. There was too much secrecy inside the organization.\n\nMilkis\n\nPlus, he headed the committee--\n\nGillespie\n\nThat was part of it. So there was a little bit--\n\nJones\n\nI'm sorry, he headed?\n\nGillespie\n\nHeaded the search committee.\n\nNelson\n\nCould you elaborate on that? What didn't happen as well as--\n\nGillespie\n\nWe were flatfooted on his record in terms of the votes that he had cast as a Member of Congress. He represented Wyoming. Some of his votes were a little tough to sell in swing-state territory. This came back, by the way, at other times that it has happened with the Bush operation. The Harriet Miers nomination is another example of that. It was held too tight for--not proper vetting because I think it wouldn't have mattered, it wouldn't disqualify the Vice President, but we would have been better prepared to deal with the--the Democrats had more information than we did in the first 24 hours of that.\n\nJones\n\nWow. They were talking dispassionate conservatism.\n\nNelson\n\nWhy did they have more information?\n\nGillespie\n\nI think they had a sense that he--they had a book on him, it was clear. They were throwing stuff out that we were scrambling to answer. When I say \"we,\" I mean that Austin was. I was in Philadelphia. The Bush campaign [snapping fingers] is a very tight operation. It wasn't there. Ordinarily when you are dealing with something in Bush world and you get a question, somebody hands you a one-pager and says, \"Here's the answer.\" We just didn't have that. The plastic bullets and things like that.\n\nNelson\n\nDid the campaign regard this as having not gone well?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, Karl talks about it in his book; the Vice President talks about it in his book.\n\nNelson\n\nDid the campaign learn from that experience about how to--in ways that translated into the general election campaign?\n\nGillespie\n\nYes, probably. I'm not sure how, but I think it was a learning experience.\n\nNelson\n\nDebate prep maybe?\n\nGillespie\n\nMaybe in the debate prep, but again, I wasn't part of the debate prep either.\n\nJones\n\nIt's interesting, because his father did the very same thing.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes. Right.\n\nJones\n\nA surprise, even a greater surprise. You could imagine since Cheney was clearly close to George W. Bush.\n\nGillespie\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nThe general, what was your role after the convention?\n\nGillespie\n\nWell, then in September things were pretty good. I went back to my firm and I was happy to be home. We had a bad--at that point it was \"they.\" They had a bad September. One of the things that they decided was that Karen was going to go on the plane with the Governor. That left a vacuum in Austin in the communications operations. So they asked me to come down and be a senior advisor to the campaign, but really I was the communications director. I functioned as the communications director.\n\nI went down there right after Labor Day, the first week of September. Karl set me up at the house of one of his friends. It was a very nice house. I was in the pool house, a really nice pool house. I like to pretend I was like Kato Kaelin. I got into the slipstream right away, in particular with Mike Gerson in the speechwriting shop and Ari [Fleischer] and Dan Bartlett in the communications shop and with Stu Stevens on the media.\n\nI became pre"
