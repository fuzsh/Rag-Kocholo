        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews (&cet.)\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) I began the new year on a hopeful note, watching the excellent 4K UHD edition of what in 1977 was the single most entrancing movie I’d ever seen and which still exerts a beautiful spell over me.\n\nI would like to think my other hopes for 2024 will not be betrayed, but short of worldwide revolution I suspect they will. As Tom Woods once noted (Woods’ Law #3): “No matter who you vote for, you always wind up getting John McCain.”\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953) James Jones’ enormous (860 pages) 1951 novel, beautifully adapted by Daniel Taradash and directed with sensitivity and grace by the splendid Fred Zinnemann. Set in and around Pearl Harbor in the months leading up to the Japanese attack and, essentially, ending on it, the picture is (presumably like its source) remarkably and unusually adult in erotic/romantic content* and, to use a word I normally avoid due to its extreme overuse, powerful in its imagery. Example: The famous love scene on the shore between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, kissing passionately as the waves break over them. That Kerr’s character is a married woman and her affair with Lancaster’s career soldier illicit (her husband, his commanding officer, is a serially unfaithful pig) added to the heat the sequence generated, yet few seem to remember how bitterly the scene ends, with Lancaster humiliating Kerr and impugning her virtue.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity, even more than A Place in the Sun, showcases Montgomery Clift’s gifts as an actor although his character is, at least to me, inexplicable: A young man planning on a career as a soldier who claims to love the Army yet who makes a habit of rebelling against his superior officers. Still, Prewitt is perhaps the Clift character who displays the greatest range of emotions, from the riant to the deeply sorrowful, and I defy you to remain unmoved when, with tears streaming down his cheeks, he plays “Taps” in honor of his murdered friend. As that friend, Private Maggio, Frank Sinatra is superb. Forget the Mario Puzo version of his casting†; Sinatra knew the role reflected his image of himself, and he gave himself over to it entirely, perhaps reminding those who know such things that a great ballad singer is also, perforce, a great actor. Lancaster too gives a fine account of the First Sergeant with no desire for promotion and the central women — Kerr and Donna Reed — are equally fine, Kerr even producing a more than creditable American accent and Reed giving a performance no one expected her capable of, including Zinnemann, who had accepted her casting with reservations.\n\nAlthough the movie pushed at the edges of the Production Code in regard to sexual relations there was some inevitable bowdlerization: Thus, the brothel Reed’s character works in was changed to a dance-hall, yet I doubt many people who saw the picture in 1953 had any difficulty figuring out that the girl was a whore. In exchange for being permitted to shoot at Schofield Barracks, however, the filmmakers had to compromise on some of Jones’ harsher material, especially in the matter of Maggio’s “treatment” at the hands of the sadistic stockade commander “Fatso” Judson (Ernest Borgnine). In the event, Zinnemann’s being made to eschew depicting the violence against Maggio may be in the movie’s favor, since we’re forced to imagine what’s been done to him, making his death scene after he escapes all the more poignant; Fatso’s own violent death is depicted aslant, making us wonder at the outcome of his fight with Prewitt until the latter emerges from the shadows. Taradash’s screenplay is marked by its intelligence, and the black-and-white cinematography, the work of Burnett Guffey, is exemplary. The head of Columbia, the monstrous Harry Cohn, initially insisted on color but Zinnemann prevailed, and the movie benefits from this, the monochrome images shimmering on the screen. (Among other pictures, Guffey, who had been in movies since 1928, later shot Bonnie and Clyde. That should give you an idea of how good he was.) The fine supporting cast includes Philip Ober as Kerr’s philandering martinet of a husband, Mickey Shaughnessy, Jack Warden, Merle Travis as a blues-singing Private, Claude Akins as one of the bullies who tries to break Clift and, in an uncredited role, the future screenwriter Alvin Sargent, who endures a shocking death by Japanese tracer-fire.\n\nThere was, by the way, a hilarious spoof of From Here to Eternity on “Your Show of Shows,” in which the Lancaster and Clift characters were more or less combined, as were Kerr’s and Young’s. The beach scene was brilliantly parodied, with Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca getting periodically doused with what are pretty obviously buckets of water thrown at them from unseen stagehands. It gets funnier and funnier. It even got to Coca, who seldom cracked on camera but who pretty much loses it here, turning her head and burying her face on Caesar’s shoulder to hide her hysteria from the audience.\n\nCarefree (1938) The seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is the slightest of their RKO musicals, the first to lose money, and the one with the least dancing. Another of those pictures whose complicated screenwriting credits betray a certain amount of panic (the script was by Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano from an “original idea” by Marian Ainslee and Guy Endore, its “story and adaptation” by the redoubtable Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, credited that same year with Bringing Up Baby) the picture casts Astaire as a dancing psychoanalyst trying to break through Rogers’ resistance to marrying Ralph Bellamy (it takes a shrink to figure that out?) and in the process falling for her himself. There are some good lines and funny situations, as when Ginger, a radio singer, wrecks her own live show under hypnosis, but there are also items that make you squirm, such as the way, again having been hypnotized, she hunts Astaire down with a shotgun, repeatedly proclaiming that “men like him should be shot down like dogs.” Fun-nee!\n\nAdding to the troubles are an ill-conceived dream sequence set to one of Irving Berlin’s less interesting tunes, which by its conception demanded to be filmed in color but which RKO refused to do, making a hash of a song Berlin pointedly called “I Used to Be Color Blind.” (It also contains a slow-motion dance, a device I resist on principle, and a prolonged kiss between Fred and Ginger, which is just plain objectionable.) There’s an extended New Dance Sensation called “The Yam,” whose melody Berlin later adapted for his war-time anthem “Any Bonds Today?” and which illustrates that a certain degree of democratization in the Astaire and Rogers universe is unwelcome; instead of those gleaming, absurd but oddly endearing white Art Deco sets complete with extras in evening dress that were the series’ mainstay from Flying Down to Rio through Swing Time we’re in a woodsy country club with patrons joining in the dance, and who wants that? Fortunately, Fred and Ginger get a good Berlin ballad (“Change Partners”) and subsequent dance routine in which he uses his big, expressive hands in an attempt to re-hypnotize her. Even better, Astaire has a jaw-dropping bit, set to a wordless tune (“Since They Turned ‘Loch Lomond’ into Swing”) in which he rhythmically hits one golf ball after another, sending every one of them soaring in perfect arcs, the entire routine performed in long, sustained camera shots. Was there nothing the man couldn’t do?\n\nLove Among the Ruins (1975) This charming, witty period comedy by James Costigan, although admired, was, somewhat surprisingly, not a ratings success. (I was watching the filmed version of George Furth’s play Twigs starring Carol Burnett that night, and I remember that deciding which to see between these two nearly engendered the 14-year-old’s equivalent of a nervous breakdown.) Despite its low viewer rating, the picture won multiple Emmys, losing only in the “Outstanding Special” category, to a TV-movie starring Judd Hirsch called “The Law,” which seems to have vanished into obscurity. I don’t know whether its author originally intended it as a play — Costigan proposed it as a 1960s television project for Lunt and Fontanne, who apparently objected to being likened to ruins and withdrew — but it feels like a stage comedy, with few scenes occurring on the London streets and most set in drawing rooms, the Old Bailey or the Inns of Court and the action rising as it might in a boulevard comedy. In any case, the dialogue sparkles with graceful aperçus, in a fashion that recalls the stage plays of Wilde and Coward and S.N. Behrman, and the stars, Laurence Olivier and Katharine Hepburn, parry and thrust with their lines like the expert verbal and dramatic fencers they were.\n\nOlivier was so often touted, in those years, as The World’s Greatest Actor, and accepted in that designation by people who had never seen him, that it was perhaps easy to forget what a superb comedian he was (although his performance opposite Michael Caine in the 1972 two-hander Sleuth should have reminded audiences of that). He’s especially funny in outrage, to which Hepburn’s maddening character repeatedly drives him; when he opens his eyes wide or screws up his face in disbelief as his voice rises to a sort of half-strangled masculine screech and his word pile up in a heated rush, he’s one of the premiere screen comedians of his age and weight. Hepburn’s role is perhaps less showy, but because we know what she refuses to reveal, until the climax anyway, her characterization becomes fascinating, an onion that resolutely refuses to be peeled. There are two wonderful supporting turns, by Colin Blakely as Olivier’s courtroom rival and Richard Pearson as Hepburn’s solicitor, and the director, Hepburn’s old friend and crony George Cukor, keeps the pace and the performances clicking along brightly. Douglas Slocombe’s photography, like John Barry’s delightful score, is exactly what is required, although you will undoubtedly notice how assiduously he protected the aging Hepburn, who seems shot not just through gauze but gauze, Vaseline and perhaps lace curtains as well.\n\nMissing (1982) The exceptional adaptation by Costa-Gavras and Donald E. Stewart of Thomas Hauser’s book on the political arrest, torture and murder of a young American in Chile for the crime of told told too much, superbly acted by Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek. The talented cast also includes Melanie Mayron, John Shea (as Charles “Charlie” Horman, the murdered man), Charles Cioffi as a creepy Naval Captain, David Clennon, Richard Venture (as the thinly-disguised Ambassador Nathanial Davis), Joe Regalbuto (as another murdered American), Keith Szarabajka and Janice Rule, as a reporter helpful to both the victim and his survivors… imagine.\n\nThe Cameraman (1928) A very funny Buster Keaton feature, his last under a new contract with MGM in which he had any level of autonomy. Although the picture was popular, the studio was determined to clamp down on Keaton’s independence; he later called his signing with Metro “the worst mistake of my life.” Buster, who also produced, stars as a New York City tintype portrait photographer who realizes (in 1928!) that the motion-picture camera is making his profession obsolete. Some of the movie’s brightest moments have little or nothing to do with the plot, such as Keaton’s impromptu pantomime of a baseball game, his riding on the outside of an omnibus and his experience at a communal swimming pool, although I don’t find the sequence in which he has to share a tiny dressing space with an overbearing Edward Brophy funny because I am constitutionally incapable of laughing at bullies, or at the trouble they cause their victims. (Maybe that’s why I’ve always been uneasy about Donald Duck?) Edward Sedgwick was the director, and the story is credited to Clyde Bruckman and Lew Lipton, but on a Keaton picture that doesn’t mean much. (The story was his and, I assume, most of the gags.) Marceline Day is charming as Buster’s inamorata, and the simian “Josephine” is wonderful as the monkey he inadvertently picks up while filming a violent tong war in an otherwise remarkably non-stereotyped Chinatown.\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) A nearly perfect Disney feature, at the time the most modern full-length cartoon the studio had ever released and among the six or seven best hand-drawn movies Walt’s animators produced in his lifetime.\n\nThe Third Man (1949) In the interviews that make up their book This is Orson Welles, Welles defined Harry Lime as a great “star part,” comparing it to a 1913 stage play called Mr. Wu in which Wu (whom Welles claimed he once played in the theatre) is discussed by the other characters for an entire act. Just before intermission a figure enters and intones, “I am Mr. Wu…”, leading the audience, buzzing between the acts, to marvel at that wonderful actor who plays Mr. Wu! Harry is discussed by everyone in The Third Man for over 50 minutes before Welles’ famous entrance in the dark of the Vienna night, supposedly revealed by a single light from a window across the street — it must have been the Luxor Lamp of post-war lightbulbs — during which he smiles wryly at getting caught, seemingly abashed by his own irresistible theatricality. Graham Greene’s divided-city mystery/thriller, his most famous “entertainment,” was wonderfully (if somewhat floridly) directed by Carol Reed and contained more memorable moments in its 104 minutes than any comparable popular movie since Casablanca, another romantic melodrama set in a turbulent time and place.\n\nHow to Murder Your Wife (1965) George Axelrod’s black comedy of misogyny divided a lot of opinion in 1965 and it’s impossible to imagine anyone making it today, or even thinking about doing so, even if it does wind up by endorsing marriage and women equally. Jack Lemmon plays the confirmed bachelor unexpectedly wed, after a drunken debauch, to the former inhabitant of a bachelor-party cake (Virna Lisi) who cannot speak a word of English. Although Lemmon responds all too enthusiastically to the more sybaritic aspects of marital life, the whole business quickly palls and he begins to fantasize a way out, at least for his successful spy comic-strip star Brash Brannigan, whom he has also married off. The picture is broad and, when Lemmon is put on trial for murder at the climax, just plain silly (no one thinks to look for Lisi’s body?) It’s also, despite the odds, very funny. Richard Quine directed with good pace, Harry Stradling’s color cinematography is mouth-watering, and in his infectious musical score Neal Hefti develops at least six distinct, complete melodies. Eddie Mayehoff gives his standard hilarious characterization as Lemmon’s lawyer, Claire Trevor is surprisingly arch as his wife, and Terry-Thomas is a wonder as Lemmon’s butler. Among the comedians in the rich supporting cast: Sidney Blackmer, Jack Albertson (“Brrrrtt! Right up the wall!”), Max Showalter, Alan Hewitt, Mary Wickes, Howard Wendell and Khigh Dhiegh. Actually, I don’t think the movie is misogynist as much as it is anti-marriage, or at any rate, anti-wife. Does that make it any less offensive to women? Probably not, but it still makes me laugh.\n\nThe Yakuza (1974) An interesting exercise in East-West tensions refracted through the traditional Japanese yakuza gangland thriller. The picture suffers from too much exposition, badly handled both by the writers (Paul Schrader and Robert Towne,‡ from a story by Leonard Schrader) and the director (Sydney Pollack), and Pollack’s refusal to use English subtitles renders long dialogue sequences featuring Ken Takakura utterly incomprehensible to a non-Japanese speaker. (To see what you’re missing, turn on the Blu-ray’s subtitle feature.) Yet it’s fascinating to watch, particularly with Robert Mitchum in the American lead. Mitchum plays a man in love with Japan, whose post-war experience during the American occupation — which of course has never ended — left him bereft of the love of his life when he crossed her brother (Takakura). It’s a stylish movie, beautifully shot in widescreen by Kozo Okazaki, which despite my reservations about Pollack as a filmmaker I must admit he was highly skilled in framing.§ Dave Grusin provided a fine, atmospheric musical score and the cast contains riches: Takakura, at once stoic and almost shockingly adept with a sword; Herb Edelman as Mitchum’s old pal, an American who put down roots in Tokyo; Keiko Kishi as Mitchum’s great love; and Brian Keith as his employer, who is not as trustworthy a crook as he wishes his compatriots to believe. As Mitchum’s bodyguard, Richard Jordan gives the sort of total performance that causes you to wonder how a young man that handsome, and that accomplished, never became an important actor in American movies. James Shigeta, who improved every picture he was in just by showing up, plays Takakura’s sage, and quietly dangerous, older brother. What stays with you about The Yakuza is its expression of psychic pain; nearly every character in it is in some kind of agony, and they keep visiting it on each other without meaning to, which in turn makes that pain equally unbearable to the one who causes it.\n\nThe Dark Horse (1932) A very amusing political satire, something American movies used to turn out on a regular basis but which the toxic partisanship of modern life has rendered entirely off-limits. (You can still write a satire, but if it doesn’t target Republicans, leftists or the non-aligned, good luck getting it produced.) Warren William plays what we would now call a political consultant, a fast-talking con artist who is let loose on a corrupt gubernatorial campaign and catapults a complete nonentity into the governor’s mansion. My revealing the ending will in no way mitigate your enjoyment of this sharp, cynical exercise which features the young Bette Davis as Williams’ inamorata, Vivienne Osborne as an ex-wife with the soul of an adding machine, Frank McHugh as an eager political operative and the genial Guy Kibbee as the unlikely candidate, of whom William memorably observes, “He’s the dumbest human being I ever saw. Every time he opens his mouth he subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge.”\n\nThat line sounds like the work of Wilson Mizner, who wrote the screenplay with Joseph Jackson. Wilson and his brother Addison were the subject of an aborted Irving Berlin musical in the 1950s and, many decades later, emerged on the stage in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s later project, which went under several titles over a number of years (Wise Guys, Gold!, Bounce and, finally, Road Show). The director of The Dark Horse, Alfred E. Green, began in pictures in 1916, eventually guiding Colleen Moore in eight of her vehicles including Sally (1925), Irene and Ella Cinders (both 1926). He also made three with George Arliss including Disraeli (1929) and The Green Goddess (1930); the somewhat notorious Baby Face (1933) starring Barbara Stanwyck; Dangerous (1935), which won Davis an apology Oscar; the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musical Thoroughbreds Don’t Cry (1937); and The Gracie Allen Murder Case (1939), a Philo Vance vehicle also starring Warren William. His work on The Dark Horse is fast and clean, and the sharp black-and-white cinematography was by Sam Polito. For those interested in trivia, the Blackfoot Chief who gives Kibbee a ceremonial headdress is played by Jim Thorpe.\n\nThanks once again to my perspicacious friend Eliot M. Camarena for the recommendation!\n\n*I understand that Jones’ editors or publisher demanded he remove some homosexual content from the original manuscript of his novel, which his heirs returned to a recent edition. Not having read the novel I have no idea what this may entail, although the author was allegedly (i.e., according to a Wikipedia entry) open about his own sexual experiences in that area.\n\n†The truth of Sinatra’s casting was less dramatic, but nearly as grubby: he was pestering his wife Ava Gardner on the African location of John Ford’s Mogambo, and to get him out of her hair (and to allow her to philander in peace) she allegedly insisted that Cohn use him as Maggio.\n\n‡If Towne is present, can Edward Taylor be far behind?\n\n§On the Yakuza commentary Pollack says he gave up shooting in widescreen, which he loved, once he realized how badly his pictures were being cropped, and panned-and-scanned, for home video. He wasn’t alone.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click the links on the capsules for the complete reviews.\n\nHopscotch (1980) Brian Garfield’s engaging espionage thriller transformed by him (and Bryan Forbes) into a comic spy caper and a terrific vehicle for Walter Matthau. Interestingly, Garfield’s book ends with a gesture by the Matthau character the author appears to have lifted from the 1973 Charley Varrick, which also starred Matthau but it’s less a literary steal than a likeable homage. Although entirely implausible — if a CIA agent actually did what Matthau’s Miles Kendig does in the movie, even that bunch of incompetents would track down and kill him — it’s thoroughly enjoyable watching Kendig twit his petty martinet of a boss (Ned Beatty, exquisitely frustrated) and evade, not merely his bright underling (Sam Waterston) but the KGB faction headed by the imperturbable Herbert Lom. Glenda Jackson had so much fun with Matthau making the delightful sleeper hit House Calls two years earlier that she signed on for what amounts to an enjoyable recurrent cameo as Miles’ sly inamorata. Pleasantly directed by Ronald Neame, warmly photographed by Arthur Ibbetson and Brian W. Roy and scored by Ian Fraser with (at Matthau’s request) some lively bits of Mozart, Hopscotch is as inconsequential as mousse au chocolate, and nearly as delicious. (Sole cavil: I could have done without the Jackson character referring to a particularly hapless spy as a “Follett the faygelah.”) Amusingly, as in Paddy Chayefsky’s script for The Hospital, several of the characters share surnames with notable mystery and thriller writers: not only Follett but Ross, Ludlum, Fleming and Westlake (first name: Parker).\n\nDestry Rides Again (1939) The enormously entertaining James Stewart-Marlene Dietrich Western, perfectly judged and with a sumptuous look courtesy of its inspired lighting director, Hal Mohr.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940) Nunnally Johnson’s very fine adaptation of the epoch-capturing John Steinbeck novel, directed with extraordinary sensitivity by John Ford, photographed by Gregg Toland with almost shocking documentary realism, and among the least artificial sound pictures of Hollywood’s so-called Golden Age.\n\nWhat a Way to Go! (1964) A big, bloated, spasmodically amusing shaggy-dog comedy starring Shirley MacLaine in her adorable kitten period and with a host of guest-stars (Dick Van Dyke, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Gene Kelly) as her ill-fated husbands, who get comic material of highly variable quality. The central joke of this DeLuxe-colored bauble is that Shirley, as the hapless Louisa May Foster, hates money but each of her successive husbands somehow inadvertently becomes obscenely rich and then is killed in ever more outrageous ways, leaving her yet another fortune. It’s fairly anemic to have come from the authors of Singin’ in the Rain and the director of The Guns of Navarone; the Betty Comden and Adolph Green script indulges the team’s penchant for overstated satire, only snippets of which (particularly those involving MacLaine and Van Dyke) are funny. An extended sequence featuring ever more ludicrous Edith Head costumes and poking fun, I think, at Ross Hunter (“Lush Budgett presents…”) goes on and on (and on) until you never want to see MacLaine again in anything more haute couture than a burlap sack.\n\nAside from the Mitchum character, who turns his back on his fortune, the gentle Jekylls Louisa marries turn so quickly, and so completely, into ravenous Hydes when money is in their grip that the situations become ridiculous even for an overblown farce like this one. Examples: Newman, who as an American artist in Paris resembles an Actors Studio dropout imitating a Teamster, with success suddenly sounds like Richard Burton (one of several Burton jokes in the picture); the passive, agreeable Van Dyke becomes a parody of the worst, barking CEO; and Kelly, a sweet-natured nightclub comedian content with being an employed failure, turns into a nightmare version of Harry Langdon, every shred of his charm obliterated. The best moments in the picture occur early and involve Margaret Dumont (whose last movie this was) as Louisa’s harpy of a mother and Van Dyke and MacLaine in a silent movie parody.\n\nThe redoubtable Leon Shamroy provided his customary beautiful color cinematography and Nelson Riddle an infectious musical score, but the best that can be said of J. Lee Thompson’s direction is that it is a professional job without the slightest individual characteristics or visual interest. The movie was originally developed for Marilyn Monroe and, after her death, reconfigured for Elizabeth Taylor. It’s possible to imagine Monroe in the role although I can’t see her bringing to it the intelligence MacLaine projects. (Taylor, who given a good enough line could seem witty, was never a comedian and would have been utterly wrong save for the fact that Louisa’s multiple marriages mirrored her own busy nuptial life.) Bob Cummings’ performance as Louisa’s psychiatrist is as unsubtle as the rest of the picture, and Dean Martin seems merely along for the ride. For those interested in coincidental trivia, Newman’s painter character is named Larry Flint.\n\nAn Unmarried Woman (1978) Paul Mazursky’s miraculous study of a woman whose life is turned upside down by her husband’s infidelity. Jill Clayburgh gives a luminous performance in the central role.\n\nThe Last Valley (1970) I was enormously impressed by this intelligent parable of the Thirty Years’ War the first time I saw it, less so on seeing it a second time after reading the bracing short novel by J.B. Pick upon which it is based. The book (whose original American title, A Last Valley, is far superior to that used by the filmmakers — what a difference an article can make) is a poetic-philosophic rumination on theology, violence, the natures of war and of men, conducted via a narrative of power and survival waged between civil forces in a secluded German glen. Pick’s story is so tightly structured that to pull out a single thread means remaking it anew. Alas, thread-pulling is what James Clavell, who adapted and directed The Last Valley, seems to have been intent on. It’s still a beautifully mounted production, with glorious cinematography by John Wilcox, a splendid Lion in Winteresque score by John Barry and superb central performances by Michael Caine as the cynical military Captain who no longer knows nor cares whose side he is fighting on and Omar Sharif as the former academic-turned-hardscrabble-survivor desperately trying to navigate between factions. Although both characters die at the end of the book as well as in the movie, the way they die matters enormously, and Clavell I’m afraid drains the meaning from those deaths, as well as the author’s savage yet eminently sensible irony.\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix (1965) An effective thriller with a tight screenplay by Lukas Heller, efficient direction by Robert Aldrich and sterling ensemble acting by its mostly male cast. Heller’s script hews closely to the intelligent, entertaining novel by Elleston Trevor, the author (under the nom de plume Adam Hill) of the Quiller books, and even improves on it a little. Beautifully photographed by Joseph Biroc and edited with panache by Michael Luciano the picture, about a group of men stranded in the Arabian desert when their transport plane crashes in a sandstorm, stars James Stewart as the captain devastated by the disaster, Richard Attenborough as his humane navigator, Peter Finch as a soft-spoken military man and Hardy Krüger as a maddeningly aloof and arrogant designer. Krüger’s character is so psychotically rigid he seems almost a new edition of the wartime Aryan. (In the novel he was British, as was everyone else.) The only major change from the book is the addition of a French doctor played by Brando’s old playmate Christian Marquand; he’s able to attend an injured youth, and later goes off with the Captain on his doomed, self-determined mission. His inclusion, however, adds little or nothing of value to the narrative. Of much greater interest are Ernest Borgnine as a pitiable mental case, Ian Bannen as a sarcastic oil fields laborer, Dan Duryea as a gentle worrier, Ronald Fraser as a career soldier who despises his superior officer, George Kennedy as a more easy-going worker, and, in a vision of the delirious soldier, Barrie Chase.\n\nThe picture ends with this rather curious dedication: “It should be remembered that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer, gave his life in the making of this film.” No, he didn’t. Someone on the filmmaking team fucked up on the safety of the movie’s makeshift airplane, and got Mantz killed through negligence. His life was taken from him, he didn’t give it.\n\n“Gave his life”! For a movie. Jesus wept.\n\nFearless (1993) Speaking of improvements on literary originals, Rafael Yglesias’ script for Fearless trims the self-indulgent fat from his own otherwise very good novel and focuses the narrative sharply, very much to the story’s benefit. It’s about two survivors of a commercial airline crash, unknown to each other before the event, and what the life-altering incident does to each of them. Carla, whose toddler was lost during the crash, becomes nearly catatonic with grief, depression and guilt; Max, who survived because he moved from his seat to comfort a frightened young boy traveling alone, behaves as if he’s invincible, unkillable. Meanwhile Max’s faltering marriage slips further away from him, his own young son is a stranger and he closes his successful architectural firm, drifting without purpose when he isn’t challenging death by performing such seemingly self-destructive stunts as balancing on the ledge of an apartment building, eating the strawberries he’s allergic to or, with (to her) apparent selflessness, proving to Carla that she could not have prevented her son’s death and nearly killing himself in the process.\n\nMax is a maddening character in the novel and would probably be equally as difficult to like with an actor less charmingly natural than Jeff Bridges playing him. Bridges has one of the most expressive faces in movies, and when he smiles in pleasure, the effect is almost like seeing the emotion depicted onscreen for the first time. It makes you understand what Max is feeling without your being told in words; you’re plugged into the character in a way that somehow eludes you on the page. As Carla, Rosie Perez gives a performance so completely raw, unstudied and without artifice it’s searing, and in a way we seldom experience movie acting. I’m tempted to say that Perez turns grieving into an art form, but that’s not exactly what I mean. Her performance in Fearless has the sort of impact we get from watching the young Brando, or from seeing Sally Field in the TV miniseries “Sybil.” It’s one of those things that seem to be beyond acting, and in that way Jeff Bridges is the perfect co-star for her. Together they create a kind of documentary realism, each complementing and in a sense completing the other’s work.\n\nFearless was directed by Peter Weir with both sensitivity and an impressive lack of sensationalism. Taking his cue from Yglesias’ writing, Weir and his gifted cinematographer Allen Daviau shoot the airplane sequences (they occur largely in flashback) not as if he’s trying to wring your guts through suspense yet making it abundantly clear what going through an airplane crash must be like. These scenes, and those following the accident, have a surreal quality which if you’ve ever been through a freak violent crash of any sort you recognize immediately. The three editors (William M. Anderson, Armen Minasian and Lee Smith) deserve real credit here as well for the impressive way these sequences play out, and for the excellence of the movie generally. Fearless was one of those rare, thoroughly satisfying, ’90s movies aimed at adults and which, naturally, was a flop at the box office. No one involved need experience the slightest sense of shame for that.\n\nSlap Shot (1977) This thoroughly engaging Paul Newman comedy about a slipping Pennsylvania hockey franchise whose fortunes change when it starts playing with greater violence got a lot of ink in its day not entirely because it was perhaps the most consistently, and often hilariously, foul-mouthed American movie up to that time but due to its having been written by (gasp!) a woman. Nancy Dowd, who a year later shared an Academy Award for the gaseous screenplay for Coming Home, based some of the picture’s plot and incidents on things her hockey-playing brother Ned told her. (He appears in Slap Shot in a funny bit as a bad-tempered goon.) As might be imagined in a frank sports movie, there are things said by some of the characters, including Newman’s Reggie Dunlop, that would cause picketing at the very least today. One of the movie’s funniest moments in 1977 involved Reggie telling the mercenary owner of the team that her young son was “a faggot.” The boy is just a child, and has exhibited no unusual behavior so it’s clear the remark isn’t directed at him at all but at his insufferable mother; Reggie knows it’ll get a rise out of her, and it does, and the shock of it for the audience was nearly as pronounced. People (including myself) roared because of the outrageousness of the line, and Newman’s nonchalance with it. I won’t spoil your possible pleasure by quoting it in full, and I presume you are broadminded enough not to be offended by it. I trust you will not betray my faith in you. Or am I being a foolish optimist?\n\nJust about everything in the picture works. The only tiresome gambit is the older player (Brad Sullivan) who talks about little other than sex, and women’s breasts, and seems (to me, anyway) by these excessive displays of heterosexual lust to be trying to prove something to himself. But he’s a minor character, and he’s more than offset by Strother Martin as the prevaricating team manager, Michael Ontkean* as the single player who refuses to go along with the changeover from skill to violence, Lindsay Crouse as his discontented wife, Jerry Houser as a sweet-natured player who decides on the utterly inappropriate nickname “Killer,” Andrew Duncan (complete with trademark wretched toupée) as a grinning fool of a local sportscaster, the young Swoosie Kurtz as a jolly player’s wife and the riotous team of Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson as the Hansen Brothers, a trio of bespectacled idiots who kick off the Charlestown Chiefs’ violent turn. The only member of the cast who weighs the picture down is Jennifer Warren; as Reggie’s ex-wife she gives the same sort of weird line-readings that put me off her equally irritating performance in the otherwise splendid Night Moves. George Roy Hill directed with his usual intelligent grace, and while we didn’t realize it at the time, his movie depicted the beginnings of the phenomenon, sped up by Reagan and his successors, of the destruction of American labor through the closure of native manufacturing. Seeing Slap Shot now, this depressing sub-theme gives the comedy an underlying frisson of sadness.\n\nBlue Skies (1946) One of those dispiriting “songbook” musicals highlighting a composer or composer/lyricist team — in this case Irving Berlin — that, aside from the songs and the stars, offers very little in the way of entertainment. (The previous Berlin extravaganzas, Holiday Inn and Easter Parade, are almost infinitely better, and they weren’t all that great to begin with.) Worse, it’s yet another Fred Astaire picture in which he either barely dances, or for which the choreography is minimal. Berlin gets the lion share of the blame here because the alleged story was his idea: A singer (Bing Crosby) and a dancer-singer (Astaire) spend years fighting over the same woman, who inexplicably loves the less reliable of them. There is in Arthur Sheekman’s perfunctory screenplay absolutely no trace of the man Groucho Marx called “The Fastest Wit in the West,” merely of a man dejectedly following orders. The only laughs in the movie stem from Billy De Wolfe’s “Mrs. Murgatroyd” routine, an early example of what would later be called gender-fuck. For the rest of the picture he runs around pretending to be heteroseuxally enamored of Olga San Juan. Pull the other one, Billy.\n\nThere are three good dances, and of these one is full of wan “comedy” (“A Couple of Song and Dance Men”) and another (“Heat Wave”) is truncated by the drama of a drunken Astaire falling from an absurd stage height. The best of this trio, however, is a masterpiece: Astaire’s magical challenge dance with nine little Freds to a slightly censored version of “Puttin’ on the Ritz” sans the original’s tone of mockery towards Blacks. Ever the perfectionist, Astaire filmed each of his alter egos separately. The rest of the numbers are just Berlin plugging his old songs in a Technicolor soup so garish you have to amuse yourself by watching the shadows on the ceilings just to keep your eyes from watering in irritation. The crowning glory is the performance by the singularly un-gifted Joan Caulfield, which is of such a mind-numbing badness it beggars belief. When I saw her co-star billing in the credits I wondered who her agent was. Later I discovered she was at the time Crosby’s mistress, and imposed on the picture over the objections of the director, Stuart Heisler. Let that serve as a demonstration of what can happen when you mix business with pleasure.\n\n*When Ontkean’s character gets thrown out of the team’s last game he does an elaborate strip-tease on the ice. It’s one of Slap Shot‘s comic highlights, and all too predictably led to that professional homophobe Richard Shickel, writing in Time, singling out the moment. “[I]n the dénouement,” Shickel whinged, “[Ontkean] is forced to go for a broader, cheaper kind of comic response.” Dig that “forced.” Did Shickel think Ontkean didn’t read the script before he signed on to be in the movie? I wonder what really bugged him: The idea of the male striptease, or the sight of an attractive young actor’s naked flesh?\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\n“Too much time alone had done something peculiar to his heart…”\n\n― James Leo Herlihy, Midnight Cowboy\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nI have had a long and somewhat troubled relationship with James Leo Herlihy’s 1965 novel and the subsequent movie made from it, for well over four decades (see Enemy, a love story) and because of that, had until recently avoided re-encountering either. Reading Herlihy’s book again for the first time since my mid-teens it struck me that the essential search of his protagonist Joe Buck, beyond “something soft and fat and gentle, full of rounding sweet places to hide in,” is for the intense, intimate form of male friendship denied him by his peculiar upbringing, one that kept him out of school and alienated from the place where most of us connected with others in our childhood and adolescence, and which tended to cement the firmest friendships of our youths. Joe is no more adept at making friends than he is at his other failed quest, selling his body to wealthy women in New York City. He has no social skills, and cannot either read the signs people give him or separate the phony from the sincere.\n\nIt’s easy on the surface to see Joe as just the proverbial fish out of water, a Southwestern rube in the Big City and unused to its ways. But revisiting Herlihy now, after a period in which, during a crucial portion of their lives, children and teenagers with developing brains were denied the ability to read the faces of other human beings or to interact with their peers on a daily basis — and by the sorts of fools who out of unreasoning fear decree that “remote learning” is the same as being in a classroom and cannot admit that many children’s deprivation precludes their owning a personal computer — Joe Buck seems like an object lesson to all such officials (elected and un-), principals, teachers and parents who eagerly slapped cloth masks across small children’s faces and otherwise isolated them from each other and from their teachers for two years. No wonder Joe has such a hard time of it; like these kids, he has no experience of people’s faces. He’s been raised in such isolation he can’t interpret social signals and he’s so naïve, and so deeply in need of friendship he cannot in the novel comprehend the manipulative, ultimately masochistic hustler Perry, and partly as a result ends up being raped in a pathetic brothel by the madam’s grotesque son.\n\nAlthough Joe Buck is, at least as far as he understands himself, heterosexual, his creator was gay, as was John Schlesinger, the man who directed the artistically exceptional (and unexpectedly successful) movie of Midnight Cowboy. As a result, some have questioned the intensity of the character’s need for male companionship, which readers of the novel may have more easily understood. Even Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, the young stars who played Joe and his grubby eventual friend Enrico “Ratso” Rizzo, misunderstood the parameters of the relationship and thought there should be a sexual encounter between the characters. Schlesinger wisely demurred. Both Joe and Rizzo (I have a hard time calling the poor, consumptive wretch “Ratso”; it just seems too cruel) are almost agonizingly lonely, yet there is nothing in their slowly growing friendship, at least in the book, that suggests a homoerotic attraction. The only exception to this in the picture is that moving moment just before they enter the Greenwich Village party when Joe tenderly wipes the sweat from Ratso’s hair and brow and Hoffman, his arms around Voight’s waist, briefly rests his face against his co-star’s flat exposed belly. It’s as far as the movie ever goes, and as far as it needs to. When Joe, unable to fulfill his fantasy of being a stud for rich women, offers himself to men, it’s with resignation that he’s broke and can’t do any better. (And anyway, he’s never the active partner in fellatio, nor passive anally.) It’s certainly not done out of any latent homoerotic desire; when the schoolboy played by a young Bob Balaban blows him in the balcony of a movie theater, Joe must fantasize about the insatiable girl he knew back home to achieve a climax.\n\nCould Joe be deluding himself about his own erotic flexibility? It’s certainly possible; in both the novel and the picture he seeks men for friendship and women seemingly only for sex, and there’s something more than a little suspect about that… although that same neurosis, the same inability to integrate mature romantic and erotic impulses to one sex or the other and to separate them from compartmentalized juvenile desires afflicts any number of men outside of books and movies. How many seemingly heterosexual men have we known who can’t wait to leave their wives or girlfriends at home while they “spend time with the boys”? They equate their spouses with obligation and their male friends with fun.\n\nBut back to Joe Buck. What he shares with Rico, and what draws these unlikely allies together, is a sense of loneliness so vast it’s nearly overwhelming. It’s why the runty street hustler invites Joe, whom he had previously cheated out of 20 dollars, to share the “X flat” in the condemned building in which he shelters. Joe, understandably, can’t comprehend Rizzo’s motive in asking him to stay, especially since the crippled reprobate doesn’t, as he sees it, “seem like a fag.” Joe has needed companionship all of his life, but after the bitter experience with Perry he’s retreated further into himself and sees cultivating friendships as a sure road to being hurt, and exploited, again. Rico needs Joe to assuage his loneliness just as Joe needs “Ratso” as something human to cling to in a scowling metropolis that sneers at and rejects him.\n\nWaldo Salt, the movie’s brilliant, blacklisted screenwriter, wisely jettisoned the first half of the novel depicting Joe’s experiences in Albuquerque and Houston but retained or elaborated on bits of his childhood and adolescence in brief, disturbing flashes — occasionally too brief, but too little is better in this case than the reverse. I do think he and Schlesinger err in depicting Joe as one of a gang of horny teenagers chasing the promiscuous girl (Jennifer Salt, the scenarist’s daughter) who metes out her favors to all and sundry but who appreciates the gentle, generous way Joe makes love to her. Why would Joe be part of that gang when he’s so clearly alone in life, his amorous grandmother (Ruth White) always off with this man or that and leaving him dinners and money for the movies in place of affection and supervision? If he could connect with a group of his peers that way, even superficially, he wouldn’t be so ill-equipped to make friends elsewhere.\n\nThat’s a rare miscalculation in a picture that gets almost everything else right, from the use of Fred Neil’s “Everybody’s Talkin'” to the casting of the supporting roles and the time-capsule view of New York as (in John Lindsey’s idiotic phrase) “Fun City” devoid of anything remotely approaching “fun.” Schlesinger was criticized for depicting a pedestrian face down on the street outside Tiffany’s while everyone except Voight passes him by as if he isn’t there but he witnessed the very thing himself on a different street. Like it or not, pictures like Midnight Cowboy, as much as the stories on the nightly news, fixed New York in the late 1960s for most Americans as a nightmare city being destroyed by crime, pollution, decaying structures and a system on the verge of collapse. (Schlesinger arrived in New York just as the infamous 1968 garbage strike began, which can’t have brightened his artistic vision.) Not that New York was alone in that sense of dystopia; nearly every large city in America then was also teetering on the edge of an abyss. But there were few movies set in New York during that period, apart from expensive musicals and bright, frothy comedies, that didn’t in some way emulate or take a leaf from the imagery Schlesinger’s gifted cinematographer Adam Holender captured.* It was certainly how I thought of New York in those years. Now, with everything on the fritz in every American city, citizens priced out of living in them, the entire population faced with manipulated inflation and shortages, seething with anxiety and wondering when the next manufactured crisis will hit, Schlesinger’s New York may not seem quite so terrible.\n\nIt’s interesting, and instructive, to view a movie at different times in your life and to see, not how the passage of time has changed your reaction but how the movie has altered the years. Few things date faster than contemporary stories, and few contemporary periods of American and European movies could become dated more quickly than those made between the mid-’60s and mid-’70s, when the cinéma vérité style exploited by directors such as Truffaut and Goddard on the Continent and quickly borrowed by British filmmakers like Tony Richardson, Lindsay Anderson and John Schlesinger, crossed the Atlantic. When I saw Midnight Cowboy as a teenager at a late-show screening in early 1979, only a decade since the picture’s release, the visuals by Schlesinger and Holender, the effects by Pablo Ferro and the editing of Hugh A. Robertson occasionally felt hopelessly dated, especially the mod Warholesque party scene in the third act. Seeing the movie again in the splendid Criterion Blu-ray, only the party felt out of date. The costumes and hairstyles worn in the movie were of their time of course, but you accept those things about motion pictures made in an increasingly distant era. (It shocks me a little to acknowledge that a picture released when I was eight years old is now further away from the present than Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid was from the world of 1969.) The way the movie was put together feels more organic today, and you can see where others, usually less talented, took from it so often and so blatantly in the years after its release that perhaps my 18-year old self was irritated because he’d seen too many tiresome knock-offs of Schlesinger’s impressionistic style.\n\nThe moments I’ve cited, and things like the flashes from Joe Buck’s past and the fantasy sequence in the Florida sun, however, are merely obvious and ostentatious examples of style — the dated stuff. The more important and lasting aspects of Schlesinger’s real style as a filmmaker are not flashy handheld camerawork and frantic editing but the compassionate manner with which he observes his characters and their milieu. Although I’ve never been wild about Sylvia Miles’ outré performance as an overripe call-girl (no wonder some people thought of her as the ultimate fag-hag)† even that character is treated, if not with sympathy, at least without condescension. I’ve read at least descriptions of the street preacher played with uncharacteristic brio by the wonderful John McGiver which call him a phony, but he’s not; if he were only that he could have been ridiculed. He’s a true believer, which is what makes Joe’s encounter with him more than merely a funny reversal set up by Rizzo to con Joe out of his money. (He’s been led to believe McGiver’s character is a procurer.)\n\nThere’s obvious feeling in the depiction, both in writing and in direction, of the two homosexual characters Joe picks up, the first (Balaban) because he’s so young and so freaked out by what he’s doing he vomits after Joe’s climax and begs him not to take his watch in payment; and the second (the superb Barnard Hughes) because the man is such a miserable, hag-ridden, self-hating fraud. Salt was right to condense the two separate encounters with the Hughes character into one; it’s not really believable in Herlihy’s novel that the man would open the door to Joe when he returns. But the scene is a bit rushed; we don’t, as we do when reading the book, have the same chance to experience just how thoroughly the pretentious conventioneering paper manufacturer from the Midwest bores the everloving bejeezus out of Joe, so that by the time he threatens and then attacks the man, there doesn’t seem any other means of dealing with him. The scene, short, sharp and brutal, doesn’t carry the sexual undertones of the novel (i.e., the older man’s arousal as he’s being beaten) but does retain the awful, almost black-comic, moment in which his dentures fall out of his mouth, allowing Joe to stuff the telephone receiver into his open maw. It’s a sad, rather terrible depiction of what the closet does to some men, and the false bonhomie Hughes affects gives his admission that he loathes life even more poignancy.\n\nWaldo Salt’s nearly perfect screenplay includes every important character and incident in the second half of the novel and adds to them in small but significant ways, the best being how he incorporated the actors’ rehearsal improvisations into his script, enriching the dialogue, especially between Joe and Rico. Rizzo’s sneering at Joe’s Western get-up as “fag stuff,” and Joe’s retort. “John Wayne! You gonna tell me he’s a fag?” came from those improvisations, as did some of their domestic arguments, and Joe’s jokes at Rico’s expense. In the sequence between Voight and Brenda Vaccaro when, due to his imbibing drugs at the party he’s impotent, her gentle probing of him over a game of what she calls “Scribbage” does not come from the novel; that exchange emerged from Waldo Salt’s fertile brain, confronts head-on the question of Joe’s sexuality, and has the desired effect on his libido: her suggesting he might be gay turns him into a (hetero)sexual tiger. For the first time since coming to New York, Joe has a successful liaison, and gets paid for it. Ironically Rizzo’s ill health becomes worse and he begs Joe to get him to Florida just as Joe finally achieves an erotic victory and a recommendation that makes him feel his luck has turned, and he can finally leave Rico behind. The even greater irony is that it won’t matter, although as in the book Joe finally admits to himself on the bus ride south that his dream was impractical.\n\nWe’ve watched Jon Voight on the screen for over half a century now, so unless you saw Midnight Cowboy when it was new you may not quite appreciate how fresh his performance as Joe Buck was, nor how fully he inhabits the role. Voight captures Joe so completely — he even pitched his natural voice higher to approximate the character’s Southwestern accent — the actor entirely disappears. Voight absolutely mastered Joe Buck’s naïve enthusiasm and his narcissistic sense of his own erotic irresistability as well as his innate kindness, all of which his experiences in the city do their best to destroy; his turn to brooding suspicion of everyone is as thoroughly believable as his previous inability to perceive the malicious intentions of others. The actor knew Joe Buck was a star-making part, and attacked it with gusto. His performance is one of the great imaginative leaps in post-war movies. I don’t see how it, or he, could have been bettered.\n\nIf I am less enamored of Hoffman’s portrayal of Rizzo it’s because he doesn’t subsume himself in the role as thoroughly as Voight. His is a more actorly performance, full of the tics and mannerisms he would display throughout his career and which damage some otherwise splendid work elsewhere: The nasal whine, the way he pushes the Noo Yawk accent a shade too vigorously, the repeated “G’head,” which reminds me rather forcefully of his constant invoking of Judge Wapner in Rain Man: Imitable. You can imitate Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo; you can’t really parody Jon Voight as Joe Buck. And yet for all of that, Hoffman is undeniably effecting. Although emotionally closed off from others and encased in the thick armor Rizzo has had to encrust about himself in order to survive, there’s a vulnerability about Hoffman’s performance that is enormously touching, particularly when he tearfully admits to Joe that he can no longer walk. Just take his assertion that he improvised the famous “I’m walkin’ here!” encounter between Rico and the law-ignoring taxi driver with more than a grain of salt; although the line may have been the actor’s, the moment was laid out in Waldo Salt’s screenplay.\n\nJohn Schlesinger made a modest name for himself as a filmmaker with British working-class pictures like A Kind of Loving and Billy Liar before gaining notoriety collaborating with the novelist and screenwriter Frederic Raphael on the “Mod London”-skewering Darling, which made Julie Christie a star and led to his being permitted to make anything he wanted. What he wanted was Far from the Madding Crowd, an interesting failure (again with Raphael) that cost MGM a bundle and embarrassed its maker. He was advised to be very careful about his next project, yet chose the adaptation of a novel treating of alienation, sex-for-hire, masculine rape, furtive homosexual encounters, poverty, disability, degradation and death — all those things the family audience can’t get enough of. One has to tip one’s hat to such audacity, and to United Artists for agreeing to it, but it would have all been for naught had Schlesinger and his creative associates not made so brilliant a movie out of it. Even the staid, moribund Motion Picture Academy took notice: At the same time John Wayne was given the Best Actor award, Midnight Cowboy took home not only the Best Director and Screenplay awards but also Best Picture, the first and only time a movie carrying an X (or NC-17) rating has copped it.‡\n\nSchlesinger’s team was so concerned with authenticity that the production designer John Robert Lloyd had the X-flat the director wanted to film in removed from its condemned building and reassembled in a studio, and the party sequence is populated with Andy Warhol’s Factory crowd: Viva, Ultra Violet, Paul Jabara, International Velvet, Taylor Mead, Paul Morrissey and, although I have been unable to spot him, Joe Dallesandro. And while viewers tend to remember the bits and pieces of Joe Buck’s youth and childhood because of their flashiness, far less commented upon, and much more notable, is the sequence in which Joe, his ever-present transistor radio to his ear and shot from below and behind, walks the city streets in a series of rapid transitions from daylight to darkness, darkness to daylight, the repetition encapsulating the soul-deadening monotony of his search for something well outside his grasp.\n\nThe use of Fred Neil’s “Everybody’s Talkin'” is representative of the picture’s integrity and its artful sense of feeling. United Artists wanted a new song it could exploit for its record division but Schlesinger was adamant about Neil’s extraordinary ballad, tossed off for an album and expressing the singer-songwriter’s desire to return to his home in Florida.§ The plangent vocals by Harry Nilsson, the music beautifully arranged by George Tipton and anchored to Al Casey’s exquisite acoustic guitar fingering (which are likely the first thing you recall when you think about it) and those long, haunting high string chords, give the picture some ineffable, even inevitable, sense of place, and being. It sounds as if Neil wrote it for this story; his song is now inseparable from the picture, cannily used in five slightly differing versions in the movie’s first half-hour. John Barry’s compositions for the picture are limited (aside from the Nilsson vocals the bulk of the music is diegetic pop recordings by The Groop, Leslie Miller and Elephant’s Memory) and his most important musical contribution is the plaintive theme for Joe which is heard in subtly different variations throughout the picture and features melancholy harmonica work by “Toots” Thielemans. The theme, and Thielemans’ playing, encapsulate Joe Buck’s journey, and when it comes in at the end, as the bus heads into Miami and Joe holds on to his lifeless friend, the sense of loneliness and loss are nearly unbearable. It’s possible the scene would have played just as well, and been equally as moving, with no music at all. But that theme accretes to Joe in such an intrinsic way it is nearly inseparable from him, and from his journey.\n\nJoe is blasted beyond words by the experience, and his lack of preparedness goes with his inability to read people; he’s been deluding himself all along about how sick Rizzo is, and Rico’s sudden yet inevitable death rocks his only friend to the core. As a novelist, Herlihy throughout his book gives us Joe’s thoughts, which are limited by his nearly total lack of education, as well as authorial observation concerning Joe denied even the greatest screenwriter, unless he wishes to quote large swaths of the prose he’s adapting, as narration. The last lines of his novel are stark, and frightening, and seem to question the notion that Joe Buck can ever climb out of the mess he and circumstance have made of his life. The final moments of Midnight Cowboy bring everything together — photography, writing, direction, acting, music — to suggest what a movie, particularly a great movie, which this is, has no words to say. And shouldn’t.\n\n*Movies as diverse as The Out of Towners (in which the city’s malevolence was the entire plot), Desperate Characters, The Hospital, They Might Be Giants, The French Connection, Shaft, Across 110th Street, The Seven Ups and The Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three viewed the city as a place that for all its cultural advantages existed in a state only slightly above that of an abattoir. About the only major filmmakers of that time who didn’t see New York as filthy and dangerous were, on opposite extremes, Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen, both of whom loved it too much to depict it pessimistically. One interesting exception was Klute; however frightening the action in that seminal thriller, the city itself looks pretty inviting.\n\n†In an incident recorded in New York magazine in the 1990s, Miles ordered a cup of coffee in a Village restaurant. When the waiter asked how she wanted it the actress trotted out that old wheeze, “I like my coffee like I like my men.”\n\nWaiter: I’m sorry, Ms. Miles. We don’t serve gay coffee.\n\n‡About that “X”: Among the other then-current MPAA ratings (“G,” “M” and “R”) only the “X” was not trademarked; anyone could use the rating, and did. United Artists simply applied it to Cowboy, which later embarrassed the MPAA (as well as the Motion Picture Academy) when the movie won Best Picture. The censoring body begged United Artists to take a token frame out and submit the movie so it could be re-rated “R.” U.A. refused. The fact that the “X,” alone of its recently adopted rating letters, was not copyrighted suggests that the board of the MPAA knew it would become associated with pornography, with which it gradually became synonymous. That’s why it wasn’t trademarked. They never wanted it to begin with. Not copyrighting the letter ensured it would disappear, which it eventually did, although not perhaps as soon as the bluestockings hoped. I care neither about the censorious Ratings Board nor the Motion Picture Academy and the annual awards its millionaires give to each other. What bugs me is the hypocrisy of both.\n\n§Nilsson, who had recorded “Everybody’s Talkin'” for his 1968 Aerial Ballet LP and hoped to write and perform the new song himself collaborated with John Barry, the movie’s musical director, on a number called “I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City.” It’s a pleasant song with a prominent banjo and some unusual and ingratiating percussion but it ultimately sounds too much like the Neil composition, without its simple genius. It’s included on Nilsson’s 1969 album Harry.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nToo many movies, not enough time: A theme of my life, and I suspect of many others’. However, I can usually pound out a set of capsule reviews within the full phases of the moon. In my defense, four titles that demanded more extensive essays than I had planned to write (excerpted hereon) had a lot to do with the delay.\n\n“And who put a gun to his head?” I hear you ask. “Does he think the world will come to a fiery end if he doesn’t complete his full compliment of movie reviews per annum?”\n\nYou cad.\n\nYoung Mr. Lincoln (1939) One of John Ford’s loveliest movies, and one which even when it sentimentalizes its characters or falls into the trap of symbolic foreshadowing is engaging on such a high level that it can only be described as genuine popular art.\n\nAll Night Long (1981) Despite the stupid tagline above, and the wink-wink/sex-farce advertising artwork, this is an absolutely charming romantic comedy from the screenwriter W.D. Richter and the director Jean-Claude Tramont starring Gene Hackman and Barbra Streisand.\n\nThe Quiller Memorandum (1966) A diminution by Harold Pinter of the exceptionally intelligent and beautifully written thriller by Elleston Trevor, writing as “Adam Hall,” that while not entirely successful is nevertheless fascinating to watch, if only for its glimpses of 1960s Berlin. (The sheer number of shiny Volkswagon Beetles on the streets is a whole movie in itself.) The picture is almost fatally flawed by its central casting, which makes absolutely no sense; I’m more or less a lifelong admirer of George Segal, but Quiller is British or he’s nothing. Although I have no quarrels with Segal’s performance, instead of concentrating on Quiller’s actions we’re distracted wondering why MI6 is assigning top secret investigations to an American. Much of the dialogue in the Pinter screenplay is Trevor’s but what’s missing is Quiller’s narration, crucial in the novel, where he takes the reader through his attempts to smoke out a resurgent Nazi organization. We share his confusion and suspicions, as well as his plans and strategies, in a way we do not in the movie and cannot as it was written and filmed. As with The Ipcress File, the producers of The Quiller Memorandum bought a complex, witty novel and boiled it down to an essence; the flavor is there, faintly, but the dish itself has been so adulterated it scarcely resembles the original. What, exactly, was the point?\n\nI am well aware that of course the point was to cash in on the ’60s mania for spies. So why not cast an English actor? After all, the period in which The Quiller Memorandum was made was also a period of mania for everything British. Nearly every element of Trevor’s book was simplified or, conversely, made needlessly complex, although I appreciate Pinter’s ironic use of the Olympiastadion in the opening scene. The climax is also good, as are the torture sequences between Segal and the silky, seductive SS mastermind wonderfully embodied by Max von Sydow and the long nocturnal pursuit of Segal through the Berlin streets. These sequences are effective primarily because they follow the action of the novel; they were too good not to use. (Trevor may or may not have known it, but his book is based on a fallacy: That the British government would be concerned with foiling renascent National Socialists when, like its American and Soviet counterparts, the Empire after the fall of Berlin jockeyed to grab as many Nazi scientists as it could.) Michael Anderson, the director, whose best movie was the Michael Todd Around the World in 80 Days, kept the picture trim and the action humming, abetted by Erwin Hillier’s beautiful widescreen cinematography, which reaches its apotheosis in an exhilarating driving sequence clearly filmed without recourse to rear-screen projection. Alec Guinness contributes one of his small, quiet gems as a superficially friendly yet oddly sinister MI6 section head, Senta Berger is lovely as a woman who knows more than she’s telling, and George Sanders and Robert Helpmann are amusing in roles that are all too brief. Trevor, by the way, wrote 78 novels (including The Flight of the Phoenix and 19 additional Quillers), 33 children’s books, 6 stage plays and 15 radio plays between 1943 and 1996. Not a patch on Barbara Cartland (723) or Isaac Asimov (500+) but impressive nonetheless.\n\nA Life at Stake (1955) A cheaply made B-movie thriller from Angela Lansbury’s lean years, seemingly lost and recently rediscovered. It’s a variation on Double Indemnity, with Lansbury in the Stanwyck role and Keith Andes as the man she and her disreputable creep of a husband (Douglass Dumbrille) hope to lure into a business arrangement and then murder for his insurance. Lansbury plays it far more ambivalently than Stanwyck was allowed to, although one’s first instincts about her character support the notion that she’s not quite what she seems. The direction by Paul Guilfoyle is serviceable but the script by Russ Bender, from a story by Hank McCune, is a cut above the norm, intelligent and often lively, especially the lines for Andes’ busybody of a landlady, marvelously played by Jane Darwell. Andes gets to show off his physique on a regular basis, which seems to be the reason he was hired, but Claudia Barrett is fascinatingly off-center as Lansbury’s younger sister; we’re never quite sure if she’s delightfully daffy, smarter than she seems or a genuine dingbat.\n\nA Life at Stake is not a classic by any means but it’s a reasonably diverting use of 76 minutes, and more than that if you like Lansbury. She was seldom given the screen roles she deserved, but she’s been a favorite with me since I first saw her in Bedknobs and Broomsticks at the theaters when I was 11 and The Manchurian Candidate on television two years later. Her distinctive voice is one I always enjoy hearing, even in movies that aren’t entirely worthy of her.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (1961) The famous adaptation by George Axelrod (screenplay) and Blake Edwards (direction) has become genuinely iconic — a word I seldom use since everyone else over-uses it — for Audrey Hepburn’s look, especially during her early morning embodiment of the title.\n\nTrue Grit (1969) The spirited adaptation of Charles Portis’ superb novel, with a canny central performance by John Wayne.\n\nThe President’s Analyst (1967) The writer-director Theodore Flicker’s great, hilarious satire on spies, liberal pieties, reactionary politics, psychoanalysis and government secrecy seems ever more relevant, and prescient.\n\nThe Shootist (1976) John Wayne’s final movie is a good picture irredeemably flawed by its star’s interference in the creative process. Since Wayne expressed strong interest in the project early on, he ought to have had enough faith in the material, and sufficient personal integrity, to see it through as written. Glendon Swarthout’s novel, about a notorious gunfighter facing his imminent death from rectal cancer, is a remarkable little book, clear-eyed and entirely unsentimental. As long as the picture sticks to Swarthout’s narrative, it’s restrained, taut and elegiac. Unfortunately, Wayne had script approval, and that meant dulling the novel’s hard edge to the movie’s detriment.\n\nOne of the book’s most extraordinary qualities is one that could not be transmogrified to film without a great deal of creativity: The way Swarthout anatomizes (if you’ll forgive a wholly appropriate pun) the effects of gun violence on the human body. Each time a character is shot, the author describes in clinical detail what the bullet does to his flesh, and his internal organs. It’s almost the literary equivalent of Sam Peckinpah’s balletic violence; it reminds the reader how transient life is, and how easily extinguished. I doubt there was a way, in 1976, to depict this in a motion picture the way in our own era the various “CSI” series showed it in nearly every episode. In any case, the loss of this is less egregious than the way two primary elements were altered: The ending, and the character of the teenage boy played by Ron Howard. In the Swarthout novel Gillom Rogers is a thoroughgoing delinquent, so viciously selfish he steals the guns from a dead man’s hands and the money left for his poor, widowed mother by the gunfighter. The movie paints Gillom as a nice lad angry about his father’s death who might go bad without guidance. And need I add that he does the right thing at the end? It’s all as phony as Wayne’s spurious claim, when he saw footage filmed during his absence that indicated the gunfighter shot one of his assailants in the back, that he’d never done such a thing before in any movie. (He had; he still demanded re-takes.)\n\nAlthough he is altogether too hale and bulky to be believable as a man who is wasting away from disease, and there is in the picture no cinematic equivalent of the harrowing moment when the gunfighter, John Books, sees the mirror reflection of his final terminal state — much less his deliberately shooting a would-be thief in the gut and a failed assassin up the ass, as if in revenge for the site of his own cancer — Wayne gives a good account of the man. (A further criticism: He’s much too old for his role, as Lauren Bacall is for hers.) Although Ron Howard’s performance as Gillom is quite good, the part is so compromised it feels like something out of a TV movie of the week instead of emerging from one of the toughest Western novels ever written. (Despite his immature voice, I think Howard underrated as an actor. It’s only as a director that he drives me onto the shoals of despair.)\n\nWhat’s best about the movie, aside from Howard and Wayne, Bruce Surtees’ autumnal cinematography and Elmer Bernstein’s threnodic score, is what’s also best about the book: The way, sniffing his death, everyone except his doctor (James Stewart) and the Bacall character flocks around to pick what it can off John Books’ still-living corpse: The bantam-weight town marshal (played with malicious glee by Harry Morgan), who is delighted to lose a source of violence; the reporter for a local paper (Rick Lenz) who sees Books as his ticket to better things; the undertaker (John Carradine, another living cadaver) who will charge the gawkers to view the body; Books’ old girlfriend (Sheree North) who hopes to parlay marriage into a tell-all memoir; the blacksmith (Scatman Crothers) who gets Books’ horse and saddle for a song; the fast-shooting faro dealer (Hugh O’Brian) hoping to make a name for himself; an old foe (Richard Boone) out for vengeance; and even the little barber (Alfred Dennis) who surreptitiously sweeps up Books’ fallen locks to sell as souvenirs. These various ghouls and carrion birds confirm Books’ cynicism, and inadvertently provide him an idea for how to die without agony. All these actors are fine, but Stewart is better than good. I don’t know whether he read Swarthout’s novel, if the screenwriters (Miles Hood Swarthout and Scott Hale) noted the doctor’s attitude in their script, or if the director, Don Siegel, instructed Stewart to do so, but the actor reads his lines with real anger, as if the doctor is so disgusted with death, and the process of dying, he almost seems to be taking it out on the patient.\n\nStagecoach (1939) John Ford’s influential Western, his first since 3 Bad Men in 1926 and the single title that redefined the contours of the genre. Adapted by Dudley Nichols from Ernest Haycox’s well-written magazine story “The Stage to Lordsburg” (with perhaps a trace of de Maupassant’s “Boule de Suif” thrown in) Stagecoach tossed out most of the childish Western clichés and enhanced its story with flesh-and-blood characters rather than mere traditional archetypes. Many have deemed the result “Grand Hotel on Wheels” but this is inapt. In Grand Hotel, most of the characters never meet the others. Here the people are thrust together, mostly in the confined space of a carriage racing across the desert. They could scarcely be more intimate with each other if they were sharing a bed. Although the conniving banker is an all too hissable villain, especially as overplayed by Berton Churchill and I think it’s asking a bit much of any audience to expect it to believe a woman about to give birth could successfully hide her advanced state of pregnancy in such close quarters, the rest of the people, and their behavior, seem perfectly true to life: The physician whose confidence has been destroyed by drink (Thomas Mitchell), the prostitute frozen out by the other passengers (Claire Trevor), the phony Southern gentleman-gambler (John Carradine), the stalwart Belle of the Old South (Louise Platt), the jovial coward of a driver (Andy Devine) and the timid milquetoast of a whiskey drummer (the all-too appropriately named Donald Meek). Only George Bancroft as the marshal riding shotgun is out of his depth but you forgive him for his general likeability.\n\nAfter toiling for nearly a decade in six-day Western quickies in part as expiation for the sin of appearing in another director’s movie, John Wayne was finally resurrected by Ford as the escaped prisoner the Ringo Kid, and no filmmaker could have more boldly announced his intention to introduce a new star than when Ford dollies in for a rare (for him) close-up of Wayne as he hails the stagecoach. Although Wayne’s face had matured from the time of The Big Trail in 1930 and he’d gained in technique through all those B- and C-grade Westerns for Columbia, Monogram and Republic, he’s still a bit callow here. Yet you hardly mind, particularly as he’s so innocently solicitous of Claire Trevor, not seeming to know why the other passengers shun her, or not caring. The other men pretend to be gentlemen but treat this woman as less than human; Wayne’s rough gunslinger and Mitchell’s bibulous outcast physician are the only real gentlemen in the bunch.\n\nShot by the great Bert Glennon against the heart-stopping vistas of Monument Valley, the backdrops in Stagecoach occasionally dwarf the human participants in a way I don’t think had ever been seen in a movie before this one. Glennon’s exterior shots are like Ansel Adams portraits come to vivid life, and on the screen in 1939 those magnificent huge skies and towering mesas must have knocked Depression audiences out. Certainly they reflect the eye of a visual poet, which for all his self-conscious bluster is what John Ford was. He made barrenness sing.\n\nHorse Feathers (1932) The Marx Brothers’ funniest comedy. The laughter is sustained throughout, and if the climactic football game is a bit of a let-down (why hire the Marx Brothers to do what the Three Stooges can?)* the rest of the picture, from Groucho’s Gilbertian introduction (“I’m Against It!”) to the surprise finale with Thelma Todd, is roaringly funny, and in a way only those American movies that just skirted enforcement of the Production Code can be. The hilarious screenplay is by S. J. Perelman, Bert Kalmar & Harry Ruby and Will B. Johnstone, with an un-credited assist from Arthur Sheekman, one of Groucho’s favorite writers. Kalmar & Ruby also wrote the songs, and one of the picture’s highlights is the different versions of “Everyone Says I Love You” they wrote for Zeppo’s Crosbyesque crooning, Chico’s fractured English, and Groucho’s cynicism (“Everyone says I love you/But just what they say it for I never knew/It’s just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who/Says I love you…”) Indeed, the rowboat scene in which he sings it to Todd, to his own charming guitar accompaniment, is the movie’s highest spot. He serenades while she (of course) does the rowing, and what makes Todd’s attempts to wrangle secret football plays from Groucho so memorable is their ingenious by-play: When she engages in baby-talk, he threatens to kick her teeth down her throat. This is the second of two pictures in which Todd appeared as Groucho’s comic/romantic foil, and you wish there had been more. They’re so evenly matched that by contrast his sniping at poor Margaret Dumont almost seems like a come-down. Almost.\n\nIf you care about such things, Norman Z. McLeod directed.\n\n*And yes, I know the Stooges weren’t in pictures then. If I had said Wheeler and Woolsey would you have known who I meant?\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Ipcress File (1965) It was probably impossible, in a standard narrative movie of the period, to adequately film Len Deighton’s first novel featuring his literally anonymous MI6 agent, so the people involved in making this one didn’t bother. Some of the threads of Deighton’s book remain, including the capture and attempted brainwashing of the agent, called “Harry Palmer” in the three movies in which Michael Caine appeared, although even the contours of that event have been altered. (The filmmakers were also at rather extreme pains to have Palmer assert his heterosexuality lest his eyeglasses and penchant for >gasp!< cooking unnerve wary ticket buyers.) The long middle section of the novel, set on an island military enclave preparing for a missile test, was jettisoned but the central question of identifying the enemy agent remained. The brainwashing techniques are less physically brutal than in the book and more techno-psychological, with the viewer being made to wonder how, if those weird lights, images and sounds assailing Palmer are supposed to be altering his mind the people, seemingly unprotected in any way, who are inflicting them are spared the effects.\n\nI may be seeming to suggest The Ipcress File is a bad movie. It isn’t. In fact, it’s a rather good one. It’s simply not as good, or as satisfying, as Deighton’s novel. There is something to be said for fealty to the source material when adapting good books, although the producer, Harry Saltzman, and his partner “Cubby” Broccoli were at the time routinely going further and further away from the Ian Fleming novels on which their wildly popular James Bond franchise movies were ostensibly based, so perhaps he didn’t think it mattered. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that on the first day of filming the director, Sidney J. Furie, contemptuously tore up the screenplay in front of the cast and crew; he was then forced, sheepishly, to ask for someone to lend him a copy so filming could commence. Naturally, the auteurists swoon over his work. Again, I’m not knocking Furie’s direction of The Ipcress File, merely his arrogance. The picture has an unprepossessing look, achieved in part by the use of Techniscope, which gave the filmmakers fewer visual options but allowed for greater depth of field.\n\nSaltzman deserves real credit for taking a chance on the little-known Michael Caine, and the movie’s success established the young actor as a rising movie star. He’s splendid as Palmer; his underplaying perfectly captures the unnamed character of the Deighton novel in his cynical lack of ideological zeal. (As with John le Carré, the British spymasters in Deighton’s books have no particular anti-Soviet axes to grind; the leave that to their American cousins.) The excellent supporting cast includes Guy Doleman and Nigel Green as Palmer’s superiors and Gordon Jackson as a jovial Scots agent. The score by the Bond composer John Barry, emphasizing the cimbalom, essentially consists of a single theme and variations, and you can only carry that off when theme is a damn good one. Barry’s is.. The James Bond connection is maintained as well by the effective editing by Peter H. Hunt. The somewhat jumbled script was by Bill Canaway and James Doran with an un-credited “polish” by Jimmy Sangster, who allegedly was responsible for removing the novel’s ambiguity.\n\nThe Glass Bottomed Boat (1966) Occasionally when I was between the ages of eight and twelve and in my early phase of movie-love, the entire family would sit down to watch the television network premiere of a picture, usually one our parents had seen when it was new in the 1960s. This was one of them. Although we had been taken to the Doris Day/Brian Keith “family” comedy With Six You Get Eggroll in 1968, I knew Day best from her weirdly malleable television series and from the recording of “Que Sera Sera” in the collection of my mother’s EPs and 45s which she gave when I was seven and which I played incessantly, learning early the orphic glories of Frank Sinatra, Nelson Riddle and Nat “King” Cole. Being a child, I liked Day very much, and liked her especially in The Glass Bottom Boat. The biggest surprise to me in seeing this agreeable Frank Tashlin-directed space-age farce again for the first time in 50 years is that I still do.\n\nI know all the arguments against her: That she played the perpetual virgin, that she was puerile and aggressively wholesome, that her sunny optimism was at odds with realities of the national mood — or, indeed, anything human — that she supposedly had all the sex appeal of the faithful family dog, and that her comedies were mostly un-funny. (Some of her harsher critics even maintained, foolishly, that she was a mediocre singer.) Many of her pictures, particularly the later ones, are admittedly bad. But even insufficient fluff like Pillow Talk, The Thrill of it All, Move Over Darling and Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? have their moments. And if she could be shrill, particularly when her characters were outraged, or overwrought when they were in peril, as in the thrillers The Man Who Knew Too Much and Midnight Lace (in both of which she is otherwise quite good) she also projected an intelligence, a comic presence and an enviable gift for timing that are very appealing in screen comedy. And at least since she’s playing a widow there’s no virginity to guard in The Glass Bottom Boat, and no adorable kids to trigger your gag reflex. There is in fact no sentimentality in the picture, which I attribute both to Everett Freeman’s mildly satirical screenplay and to Tashlin’s live-action cartoon direction.\n\nSome of the comic set-pieces are labored, some too broad and the gags are occasionally more obvious than clever. But what works, works exceptionally well, and that includes the sparkling supporting cast: John McGiver, Edward Andrews, Dick Martin, Ellen Corby, Alice Pearce, George Tobias, Arthur Godfrey and Paul Lynde, who even gets a drag sequence… and God, what an ugly woman he makes! Rod Taylor, always likable, is the rocketship designer who sets his cap for Doris, Eric Fleming the meany posing as a government agent and Dom DeLuise, who is annoying in larger roles, has just the right sized one here. (Robert Vaughan also has a gag cameo at a party.) While the back-projection in a few scenes is poor, Leon Shamroy’s widescreen color photography is otherwise glorious. There are also a pair of charming musical sequences. In the first, Day and Godfrey perform a duet of the deliberately silly title song, whose melody is taken from Day’s recording of “Soft as the Starlight,” written by Joe Lubin and Jerome Howard (itself based on “Hush, Little Baby”); it feels entirely spontaneous, with Doris fluffing some of the lyrics as if she’s trying to remember a song learned from her father in childhood and which she hasn’t sung in years. The second is “Soft as the Starlight” itself, which she sings beguilingly while snuffing the candles on her father’s Catalina porch and which Tashlin films in a single, long take (at least until the end when he’s forced to make a cut due to the overhead beams.) It’s a lovely respite from the picture’s sometimes frenetic comedy — a breather, like the songs in Roman comedies.\n\nThe Love Bug (1969) This, and the “Dexter Reilly” series starring Kurt Russell, were the apogee of a certain type of comedy associated with the Walt Disney studios. Beginning with The Shaggy Dog in 1959 and running through the 1960s and into the ’70s, these were broad farces, often with science-fiction style special effects or supernatural elements, frequently written either by Bill Walsh or (as this one was) by Walsh and Don DaGradi. The gimmicks occasionally overwhelmed the humor, but in the cleverly-titled The Love Bug the elements are perfectly balanced. It was a movie I loved at eight, and which inspired in me an enduring ardor for the classic 1960s Volkswagen Beetle, an enthusiasm my father, knowing his car engines, did his best to dampen. (Of course, Dad didn’t apply that caution to himself, as his folly in falling in love with the 1970 Sunbeam Alpine attested.)\n\nI wouldn’t have known what it meant at the time, but I’m pretty sure my affection for the movie was related, at least in part, to a pre-pubescent crush on “Herbie”‘s driver: Dean Jones, a perennial presence in my childish Disney universe, dealing, in various shades of charm and frustration, with monkeys, great Danes, racehorses and the ghosts of pirates, his conviction as much as his good looks turning him into an ideal figure on whom to fasten my unfocused devotion. (You can imagine how much that fondness deepened in me when, at 15, I discovered the original cast album of Company and heard the extent of Jones’ vocal range. Has anyone since sung “Being Alive” as powerfully and yet with as much vulnerability as he did?) I don’t think Jones gets nearly the credit he deserves as an actor, probably because of the many Disney movies in which he appeared. He has, for example, a scene in the otherwise horribly misguided adaptation of Jerry Sterner’s wonderful play Other People’s Money that in its quietly guilt-racked way is one of the finest pieces of acting I’ve ever seen, and I seem to be almost alone in having seen it. That sense of conviction I mentioned is his acting bedrock. If you wish to sell a fantasy, or a far-fetched narrative of any kind, you’d better have stars who can convey belief or you’re just slumming and the audience will know it. Good screenwriting helps, of course; the pivotal moment when Jones’ likeable but undistinguished race-car driver realizes the extent of sentient feeling that exists in the little VW and goes chasing after him through the San Francisco fog sells the rest of the picture. We can believe in Herbie because Jones does.\n\nExcept for a rather ugly little throwaway joke involving a pair of overage hippies, one of whom calls the other “Guinevere,” the picture is the most amiable family comedy imaginable, and the tricks are so well done you seldom see the joins. (A sight-gag involving David Tomlinson and a black bear was pretty obviously done in part with an animatronic bruin, but it’s funny enough you don’t mind its slight air of artificiality.) Walsh and DaGradi keep things humming with well-defined comic characters, the director, Robert Stevenson, frames the comic set-pieces efficiently, and a terrific cast of comedians does the rest. Aside from Tomlinson, either smilingly unctuous or barking with irrationally self-serving rage, this includes the chipper Michelle Lee as the young woman with whom Jones meets-cute and with whom he bickers before the inevitable clinch; Buddy Hackett as the overage flower-child Tennessee Steinmetz whose lightly and absurdly philosophical bent is a tonic; Joe Flynn as Tomlinson’s toadying associate; Benson Fong as a savvy Chinese entrepreneur; Joe E. Ross as a smiling detective; Iris Adrian as a cranky car-hop (ask your mother); and Ned Glass as an exasperated toll-booth attendant. (Gary Owens, familiar to television viewers of the time from “Laugh-In,” also shows up as a race commentator.) The drivers and stunt men, one of whom was Bill Hicks, received a special credit in the main titles, and with good reason. And the score by George Bruns adds exactly the right touch, especially in the quirky, sunny little waltz theme he composed for Herbie. It’s the essence of the little car summed up in purely musical terms and it makes me smile every time I hear it.\n\nIt’s a rare and enchanting thing to re-encounter something which gave you special pleasure in childhood and that you find you’re not ashamed to bump into again years later.\n\n“They make ten thousand cars. They make them exactly the same way. And one or two of them turn out to be something special. Nobody knows why.” — Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) in The Love Bug\n\nZelig (1983) Technically, Zelig is Woody Allen’s most accomplished movie. But as he rightly pointed out when his cinematographer, the great Gordon Willis, got the first of his only two Academy Awards nomination for it, it’s a trick movie, not one of Willis’ demonstrable masterpieces of lighting like The Godfather, All the President’s Men or Manhattan. Still, it’s at least trick photography in support of something: A simultaneously funny and troubling faux documentary about a nebbish so devoid of a personality he assumes the characteristics of any man around him — a person Bruno Bettleheim, interviewed about him onscreen, describes as “the ultimate conformist.”\n\nSome reviewers in 1983 thought that in his use of interviewees Allen was taking off from Warren Beatty’s “Witnesses” in Reds, and I wondered at the time if they’d ever seen a documentary before. Talking heads are de rigeur in these things, especially on television, and Zelig has the flavor of a vintage BBC program. Besides, Beatty’s interviewees were all there. They’d lived through the first World War and the Russian Revolution. Allen’s interview subjects are mostly writers (Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow), historians (Irving Howe), academics and psychiatrists (Bettelheim) commenting on an historical phenomenon older than themselves. (The exceptions are people like the Parisian nightclub owner Bricktop, there to give a whiff of verisimilitude to the movie.) They go with the doctored 1920s and ’30s footage in which, well before Forrest Gump, the filmmaker places his fictional protagonist among contemporary figures from Babe Ruth to Adolph Hitler.\n\nThe absurdist vein of some of the picture’s narration sounds a little too like the jokes in Allen’s New Yorker pieces and his early movies for comfort; they’re the least successful things in those projects, and we’d thought by 1983 he’d outgrown them. I also don’t buy Mia Farrow as a psychiatrist, perhaps because she needs one of her own too badly. Eric Lundegaard in his 2011 review feels that Leonard Zelig shouldn’t have spoken because hearing Woody Allen’s voice ruins the idea of the “chameleon man,” and while I’m sympathetic I would argue that seeing Allen as Zelig is a spoiler as well. Full success of the gimmick would have involved an actor almost no one had ever seen or heard before. In any case, Allen is more subdued here than usual, hence less obnoxious, and his gift for physical comedy is best represented by the hilarious moment in which he gets into a shoving match with an aged psychiatrist, all the funnier for being shown in the distance so that when it begins we’re not quite sure what we’re seeing.\n\nThe best things in the movie, aside from Allen’s imaginative use of physical types for Zelig to morph into (including, in a photograph, the famous portrait of Caruso in Pagliacchio) are Willis’ work and the music. Dick Hyman not only arranged, in his (as they used to say) inimitable style, a program of period songs, but wrote several pastiche numbers of his own: “Leonard the Lizard,” “Doin’ the Chameleon,” “You May Be Six People, But I Love You,” “Reptile Eyes” (performed by Rose Marie Jun) and even some snippets of a “Changing Man Concerto.” The musical highlight, however, is the delicious “Chameleon Days,” performed, so we are told, by Helen Kane but actually by Mae Questel. Since Kane famously sued the Max Fleischer Studios over Betty Boop, for whom Questel provided the voice, this can legitimately be cited as irony.\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) A charming compilation of three Disney featurettes from the work of A.A. Milne: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968) and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974).\n\nQ & A (1990) Sidney Lumet, acting as both writer and director, delivers a tough, visceral account of the equally striking novel by Edwin Torres, featuring a frightening performance by Nick Nolte as a psychopathic New York City cop.\n\nWill Penny (1967) The writer/director Tom Gries’ character study of an ageing cowboy is one of the few genuinely adult Westerns made in America, and one of the most satisfying.\n\nThe Odd Couple (1968) The funniest American play of the post-war era in its equally hilarious movie adaptation.\n\nThe Professionals (1966) Richard Brooks’ enormously engaging latter-day Western from the delicious Frank Rourke novel. It may not speak to the human condition the way Will Penny does, but it’s still one of the most entertaining movies of its era, and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nKing Rat (1965) An evocative, thoughtful yet curiously uninspired adaptation by Bryan Forbes of James Clavell’s debut novel, the first in his so-called Asian Saga. (The book, and the movie, are fictionalized memoirs of Clavell’s experience as a British prisoner of war in the Japanese camp at Changi.) This is one of those movies which while it honors its source and is by no means bad is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for. It’s a quality I’ve noticed before in Forbes’ work, notably Scéance on a Wet Afternoon (1964); considering the excellence of the Mark McShane novel on which it was based, the picture should have been a classic but lacks some almost indefinable element — the je nais se quoi of art — that might have lifted it into the Pantheon. The same is true of King Rat. It’s decently enough done, and it’s certainly well cast (George Segal, James Fox, Tom Courtenay, John Mills, Leonard Rossiter, Denholm Elliott, Alan Webb) but it’s a bore to write about. Forbes is workman-like, and earnest, but the divine spark was never lit in him. He lacks, say, both the crazy inspiration of a John Huston and the image-mad power of a David Lean. The result is work that holds your interest and is thoroughly respectable, but who wants respectability from a movie? Segal, Fox and Courtney embody their roles perfectly, although the latter’s is noticeably truncated, and the black and white photography is by Burnett Guffey, who two years on from this would light Bonnie and Clyde. The John Barry score, with its odd use of the cimbalom for a story taking place in Singapore is nonetheless splendid, anchored to one of his indelible main themes, which captures the essential melancholy and aloneness beneath King’s gregarious façade. But Clavell’s book, once you’ve finished it, haunts you. At the end of the movie all you’re liable to be thinking about is what you want for dinner.\n\nBreakheart Pass (1975) A dandy mystery thriller in the guise of a conventional Western which despite the then extremely popular Charles Bronson in the lead somehow failed to find its audience. Based by Alistair MacLean on his 1974 novel, which itself reads like an extended treatment for a screenplay, the picture has pace, intelligence, excitement, and character: Everything we look for in a good escapist movie and including as well a plot whose modest but intriguing complications would almost certainly preclude its being made today.\n\nEven so, Bronson was reportedly unhappy that the true nature of his character’s role in the story was revealed earlier than MacLean chose to do in his book and he was right to be upset; as much as anything else in the novel it’s the central mystery of just who the hell “John Deakin” is that keeps the reader happily turning the pages. But the picture has much to compensate for the lapse, including glorious Idaho location cinematography by the great Lucien Ballard; top-notch editing by Byron Brandt that takes in a blood-curdling sequence involving runaway train-cars filled with Union soldiers*; and a cast of old pros: Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning, Ed Lauter, David Huddleston, Roy Jenson and Eddie Little Sky. Bronson’s wife Jill Ireland represents the younger generation, as the plucky dame who becomes Bronson’s confederate, and the former boxer Archie Moore (once a very fine if physically mis-cast Joe Mott in the live television version of The Iceman Cometh) has a fight with Bronson on top of the speeding locomotive traveling over elevated tracks above an unforgiving gorge that is the last word in white-knuckle stuff. Tom Gries directed with understated flair, and Jerry Goldsmith wrote one of his characteristically intense, propulsive scores.\n\nAt the time of the movie’s release Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times called Breakheart Pass “a fun if familiar picture but is played so broadly on such an elementary level that it can hope to satisfy only the most undemanding of viewer.” I presume Thomas meant that superfluous “of” to distinguish his intellectual capacities as far greater than those possessed by us mere undemanding types. And by sheerest coincidence while writing this I came across, in the liner rotes for Film Score Monthly’s release of the Quincy Jones score for The Split (1968) a quote from the same critic in which he uses the self-concocted word “incredibilities.” Apparently Thomas was himself undemanding, at least as far as correct grammar was concerned.\n\nBullitt (1968) Steve McQueen’s allure eludes me. A performer who continually asks to have his lines reduced may be, as McQueen labeled himself, a “reactor,” but he’s not an actor. John Wayne called himself a reactor too, and while he knew he registered most forcefully without dialogue, or when it was minimal, he wasn’t afraid of words. As for the man’s alleged “cool,” what we most often see in him is a blankness onto which the audience projects whatever it thinks he’s thinking. And while I prefer to avoid comparing actors,"
