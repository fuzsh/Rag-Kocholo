Max tells the two to go for a ride. Labatouche says to Macaffe hat the car is a bribe to keep Max on the road. We cut to later that night where Max wiped out another joyrider.

Somebody outside cuts his brakes while he checks out the singer*\n\nW: Not exactly Olivia Newton John.\n\n*Goose falls for the Singer. Meanwhile outside somebody fucks with the bike more. Next morning Goose gets ready for work and leaves the singer’s bed*\n\nW: Well that was a romp.\n\n*Goose gets on his bike and rides*\n\nWi: They did something to it.\n\n*Johnny wakes up nearby and flicks a lighter*\n\nWa: Did they cut the fuel line?\n\n*Johnny burns himself*\n\nWi: No, he’s just an idiot.\n\n*Goose goes 100 mph on his bike and it jams, he and the bike go flying*\n\nW: Woah!\n\n*Goose staggers around and rips the radio out.

Jessie wakes up and looks for him. He’s eating a peanut butter and honey sandwhich. Jessie can tell he’s freaked out.

Macaffe says Goose bought it*\n\nWa: So he didn’t make it?\n\n*Macaffe tries to talk him out of it and Max says the badge is holding him back. Macaffe says to take a few weeks off. We get a montage of Max doing things with Jessie including buying a dog and relaxing by the lake*\n\nW: Nice interlude…now can we get back to revenge please?\n\n*Max talks to an auto guy with Jessie and child in the car.

Benno leads Jessie back to Max and May scolds Benno for scaring her. Max runs into the woods with a shotgun*\n\nW: Can’t use Benno for muscle?\n\n*May consoles Jessie and calls for The Dark One. Jessie realizes Sproggo is gone*\n\nWa: They took the kid.\n\n*Jessie runs into Toecutter’s crew. Cundalini had the hand lopped off, not Mudguts. Toecutter says he wants her and the hand back. May finds them and pulls a gun. She holds them all at gunpoint and tells Jessie to take the kid and run. She does and retreats to the car as May locks them all in a shed. She tells Jessie to get out of there and they all drive off*\n\nW: Bought her some time.\n\n*Toecutter’s crew escapes and they hop on bikes. Max and Benno run but the car dies on the road*\n\nWi: That’s right they had a broken fan belt.\n\n*May loads up the shotgun*\n\nWi: Yeah run down the middle of the road, that’ll work.\n\n*May misses Toecutter and they run over the child and Jessie. May and Max cry*\n\nWa: He’s gonna kill them all.\n\n*Doctor says Sproggo is dead and Jessie is critical and may not make it. Max rips up the rubber mask*\n\nWi: Time for revenge.\n\n*Max gets packed for battle*\n\nW: The transformation is complete.\n\n*Max finds the guy trying to sell him the tire from earlier and tortures him into giving up Toecutter’s location. He rides up in the rigged up car from earlier now painted black on the gang and wipes one of them out. He circles back and wipes most of the gang out in one sweep*\n\nWi: Like ten pins!\n\n*Bubba and Toecutter check out the loot from the car and finds two pictures, Jessie and Goose. He realizes he just killed Max’s family*\n\nW: You’re fucked now.\n\n*Max is ambushed. He’s shot in the leg and Bubbs runs over his arm. Toecutter says to stop messing around and kill him. Bubba goes to finish him off and Max blows him away with a sawed off shotgun*\n\nW: One down, two to go.\n\n*Johnny takes off and Toecutter hisses at Max before they take off. Max limps after them*\n\nWa: He only needs one foot to ride and one arm to drive anyway.\n\nWi: Heh, there’s a vulture picking at Bubba already.\n\n*Max hunts down Johnny and Toecutter. Max finds Toecutter first and forces him to get run over by a mack truck*\n\nWi: So much for the Toecutter.\n\n*Max drives down the road in a trance*\n\nWa: He’s insane.\n\nWi: No, he’s losing blood, there’s no way he can keep awake for this long.\n\n*Max finds Johnny stopped on the road, looting somebody*\n\nWi: Only one left.\n\n*Johnny tries to talk his way out of it as Max cuffs him ankle first to a turned over car. Max sets the car to blow and tells Johnny he can hack his way out of the cuffs in ten minutes or his foot in 5. Max takes off and the truck blows, taking Johnny out with it. Max drives away as the credits roll*\n\nWi: That’s it huh?\n\nWa: Well we didn’t see if he cut his way out of it or not.\n\nThe Grand Wizard has no assessment\n\nThe Warlock’s Assessment: I give it a 6.5 out of 10. We had a lot of good cat and mouse stuff with good cinematography even if some of the fates of certain characters weren’t entirely explained. It was good action and well worth taking a look at at least once.\n\nFinal Grade: 6.5 out of 10 – Very Good\n\n*Warlock rises from the couch*\n\nW: Well guys that was Mad Max, let me shut that off…okay. Now THAT was good. The Mad Max series is remembered mostly due to The Road Warrior but the first one was a great set up to why Max is the way he is in the future movies. The plot was easy to follow and the villains had different depth to them. The characters were also likeable or love to hate so you definitely want to see the villains get their asses handed to them. It was 1979 so the gore effects were at a minimum but that made the psychological aspect even better. You had to use your imagination on how a burnt up Goose looked. All in all it was a good movie, not an all time great, but a good watch. With that we come to the close of another edition of Warlock’s Movie Realm. Until next time ladies and gentlemen, take care and I will see you all in the near future. Peace!"
