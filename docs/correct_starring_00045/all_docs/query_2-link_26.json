        "meta_description": "\"When the gangs take over the highway...Remember he's on your side.\"\r\nIt is true to say that the worldwide advertising poster campaign for George Miller's 1979 cinematic 'game changer' \"Mad Max\" is special and presented here this original first year of British release UK one sheet film poster is no exception. Iconic Tom Beauvais' artwork of an MFP figure pointing a shotgun directly at the viewer has been used and the car below the figure is a hybrid between the colourful V8 Interceptor cop vehicles and Max’s black Pursuit. It is a fantastic looking poster, perfectly suited by the one sheet design and very desirable in this scarce portrait format. In this excellent unrestored original condition it is very scarce and presents to an a very high standard and is easily the best example of this cult poster I have ever offered for sale with the minimal of handling wear. Originally rolled (as issued) this standout piece has deep, vibrant colours and stunning memorable sci-fi imagery. An extremely collectable and rare film poster from one of the most genre defining Film's ever made.",

        "text": "Mad Max Movie Poster\n\n“Taking place in a dystopian Australia in the near future, Mad Max tells the story of a highway patrolman cruising the squalid back roads that have become the breeding ground of criminals foraging for gasoline and scraps. When his wife and child meet a grisly end at the hands of a motorcycle gang, Max sets out across the barren wastelands in search of revenge.”\n\nIn spite of the fact that the 1981 film “The Road Warrior“—the second influential cinematic work of writer/director George Miller‘s Dystopian vision of the near future trilogy—leads to receive the anti-hero Max, released two years earlier, “Mad Max“ is where it all started… For it was here that Miller first brought to the screen his hellish vision, where civil society is under siege by crime and disorder, with the strength and charisma of a new young, tough, good looking actor by the name of Mel Gibson.\n\nGibson was just 23 years old when he took the role of Max Rockatansky—a young hotshot cop so emotionally wounded—and was such an unknown star that when the film was hitting the screens in the States, the preview trailers didn’t even mentioned him but instead focused on the movie’s coolest and most original car action ever filmed… In retrospect, of course, Gibson’s portrayal of a relentless vigilante is an essential element of the picture…\n\nIn the Australian outback, Rockatansky is a motorcycle cop trying to keep order in a quickly disintegrating society… Vicious lawless bikers and road-raging psychopaths race up and down the forbidden territories, raping and pillaging the peaceful towns, and one such bunch ends up at the door of Max’s wife (Joanne Samuel), and their 2-year old son… When they are both lying dead in middle of the road, Max is all driven over the edge, and so starts a high-speed pursuit involving wild rides, chilling fights, and memorable fast-motion suspenseful scenes rarely equaled in cinema.\n\nVintage Movie Posters Grading Criteria\n\nMint\n\nA poster that has never been used or displayed and may show the most minor signs of age and wear.

May have staining, cracking, dry rot, and/or large tears. May be heavily soiled, may have pieces missing. In need of major restoration.\n\nAll photographs and images used on our site are photographs of the actual poster/item you are buying, we do not use stock photographs.\n\nMost Popular Poster Types\n\nUS Posters\n\nLOBBY CARD\n\n11 x 14″ printed on heavy stock paper. Used as display in theatre lobbies. Originally made in sets of eight. Some sets have a title card, which contains credits and artwork, essentially a mini-poster. The remaining seven cards are coloured photographic credits and poster artwork showing different scenes from the movie.\n\nWINDOW CARD\n\n14 x 22″ printed on heavy stock paper with the top 4-6 inches usually left blank for the local cinema owner to fill in the cinema and the date it was due to play. Largely discontinued during the 1970’s.\n\nHALF SHEET\n\n22 x 28″ printed on heavy stock paper. The image displayed is normally a smaller version of the main poster, although some do have different artworks and sometimes come in two versions.\n\nINSERT\n\n14 x 36″ printed on heavy stock paper. Inserts usually have the same artwork as a one sheet. Popular with collectors since they are smaller and easier to frame. Normally come tri folded or rolled.\n\nSTYLE Y/FORTY BY SIXTY\n\n40 x 60″ printed on heavy stock paper. Rare since they were primarily used for major motion pictures only. Designed to be used outside the theatre, on an easel, normally at a drive-in movie theatre.\n\nONE-SHEET\n\n27 x 41″ printed on paper. This is the most common size of poster, intended to be displayed in a glass “marquee” case. It is the most sought after size by collectors. Since the 1980’s most posters are sent to the theatre rolled and maybe slightly smaller measuring 27″ by 40″ and with the advent of backlit light boxes a growing number of modern movie posters are available double-sided and the more traditional single-sided.\n\nTHREE-SHEET\n\n41 x 81″ printed on paper. These were printed on two or three separate sheets designed to overlap, few survive. Used for larger advertising spaces, normally posted on walls, perfect for huge movie theatres the drive-in, where people could see them from a distance. From the 1970’s on, three-sheets were sometimes printed in one piece and issued as “international” versions to be used abroad.\n\nBRITISH Posters\n\nBRITISH QUAD\n\n30 x 40″ Most common poster size used in the UK. British Quads are horizontal and may have different artwork to the US one sheet. Like a US one sheet they normally come in two versions. Like a US one sheet they are usually supplied single-sided or more commonly now as a double sided poster.\n\nBRITISH ONE-SHEET\n\n27 X 40″, printed on paper. Very rarely used size.\n\nITALIAN Posters\n\nITALIAN LOCANDINA\n\n13 x 28″ six inches shorter than the US insert, very nice size to frame. Italian poster illustrators are some of the best in the industry.\n\nITALIAN PHOTOBUSTA\n\n18 x 26″ Glossy, high quality, used as lobby cards in Italy. Size may vary, either vertical or horizontal format. There are also double Photobusta or mini Photobusta.\n\n2-FOGLIO (DUE)\n\n(DUE): 39 x 55″ This is the standard poster size used in Italy. Italian poster illustrators are some of the best in the industry.\n\n4-FOGLIO\n\n(QUATTRO) 55 x 79″ Very large Italian poster printed in two pieces, often contains very beautiful artwork.\n\nFRENCH Posters\n\nFRENCH\n\n47 x 63″ (GRANDE) or 24 x 33″ (PETITE) French movie posters normally come with different artwork to either the US or the UK. Like the Italian’s some of the artwork is extrememly beautiful."
