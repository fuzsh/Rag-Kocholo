Brian Yinger said he tried to break the habit when he was ordered to six months ago but was brought before a department disciplinary board when he forgot while writing some reports. \"The way he was writing them was confusing to the typist,\" said Police Chief Robert Deziel. \"He defied the order to stop. He was told he would face disciplinary action.\" The board suspended Yinger without pay for three days. He was also ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine whether the old sevens are out of his system. \"I've been making these sevens for 30 years,\" said Yinger, who returned to work Thursday after his suspension. \"I've never had a problem before.\" ------------------------------ Date: 8 Dec 92 21:57:01 GMT From: black@lester.sybase.com (Chris Black) Subject: BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY Newsgroups: sci.med If you POST with your COMPUTER TURNED OFF and a COPPER WIRE around your left foot, your posting will reach EVEN MORE PEOPLE than if you turned your computer on.

In true Cool Hand Luke style, we all sat down at Chef Ho's Excellent Dumpling House on Pell Street (official home of the Chinese Mafia) and consumed some 400 or so dumplings in a big orgy of grease and hot sesame oil. For those of you who have not yet experienced the phenomenon of fried pork dumplings, they're about the size of a hard boiled egg and have about twice the cholesterol. We then went for ice cream. For all you potential competitors, I've attached the official scores and score keeping procedures from our official referee, Antonio Paras: Hey guys: Here is the proposition for the way the bill is going to be distributed at the `PIG OF THE YEAR' contest: 10 = # of contestants Xi = # of dumplings the i'th best eater ate. X1 = 55 X5 = 40 X9 = 31 X2 = 51 X6 = 34 X10 = 25 X3 = 48 X7 = 32 X4 = 45 X8 = 32 1=HARTOSH 2=PAT 3=YOSHI 4=MARCUS 5=ANTONIO 6=SERGIO 7=KEN 8=GEOFF 9=CHRIS 10=HECTOR Yi = (Xn-Xi)^0.72 = distance in dumplings from winner Y1 = 0 Y5 = 7.072 Y9 = 9.857 Y2 = 2.713 Y6 = 8.954 Y10 = 11.575 Y3 = 4.059 Y7 = 9.560 Y4 = 5.248 Y8 = 9.560 D = Y1 + Y2 + ... + Y10 D = 68.553 Pi = Percentage i'th eater pays Pi = Yi/D P1 = 0.0% P5 = 10.3% P9 = 14.4% P2 = 4.0% P6 = 13.1% P10 = 16.9% P3 = 5.9% P7 = 13.9% P4 = 7.7% P8 = 13.9% So you pay according to what you don't eat.

In October, biologists at China's Northwest University in Xian reported finding a 77-pound slimeball floating on a river in Shaanxi province. According to the scientists, the slimeball, a pure white fungus, gained 22 pounds in the first three days the scientists observed it, and has the ability to move across the ground on its own. Three maintenance workers in Alexandria, Ind., fixed a massive street-flooding problem in October when they pulled a 200-pound hairball from a manhole.

I (have) no choice (but to release her).\" -- Joe Albert Ruiz, 19, was arrested in Santa Maria in September. Police said he had broken into a car in the middle of the night and was in the trunk, disconnecting the rear speakers, when the trunk closed and locked him in. Neighbors reported strange noises, and a police officer called to the scene heard Ruiz banging on the trunk and yelling, \"Let me out!\" -- Swedish Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik came under criticism in October over a rehabilitation program established to help prison inmates adjust to society.

One of Louis IX's purchases, from when he was on Crusade. Actually I thought it was gone. A lot of the religious relics that belonged to the State were lost, discarded, or desecrated during the Revolution. They used to have a terrific inventory of red-letter relics at the Abbey of St Denis before it was sacked, including (supposedly) the chinbone of Mary Magdalen and the Holy Manger. I blame St Helen (Constantine's Mom) for a lot of this. The woman had *no* sales resistance. Whenever she went into the marketplace, merchants would sidle up to her and offer to sell her the latest rediscovered thing. Feathers from St Gabriel and all that kind of stuff. They used to have a bowl of chicken bones someplace in Palestine that was venerated as the mortal remains of the Holy Innocents. (I think I learned that from INNOCENTS ABROAD, which Joel is quite right to recommend.) I myself have seen the left (I think it was left) arm of St Augustine (the Canterbury fellow, not the Hippo one) and a knuckle of St Dunstan (I think it was Dunstan), but they wouldn't let me play with them. That was at a monastery at Three Rivers. When I lived in Louisville I used to pop into St. Martin-of-Tours and pay my respects to Sts Maximus and - oh, what was her name - not Praxilla, that's a poet -- I don't remember her name. They were under the side altars - old skeletons in glass boxes, dressed up in ermine and velvet with slippers on their little bony toes. They were dug up from under the Coliseum, and sent to St Martin's as a parish centennial present from Pius XII. Here, have a saint.

Or do you mean the the chinbone of Mary Magdalene and the chinbone of the Holy Manager (of the Holy-day Inn(?) that had no Holy Room) who was decked by the Holy Drone, Joseph, right on the chinbone (!) because he cast Holy Aspersions on the Holy Impregnation and Joseph (the Holy Drone) was feeling kind of cranky about the whole Holy Thing because he had had just about enough of these insinuations (Holy ones) that he wasn't-man-enough-to-do-the-job-himself (wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and had to go get someone else to do stand in, so to speak, and if it really was God Almighty Himself (the Holy One) who had done the honors (oops! the Holy Honors) then why is the Holy Couple drifting around the Holy Countryside looking for a place to stay instead of getting some sort of Immaculate Reception somewhere that befits the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (albeit in infant form). ------------------------------ Date: 11 Dec 92 17:20:03 GMT From: nalin@cs.uregina.ca (Nalin Whatyamacallit) Subject: Publication Ban on Page 1 Newsgroups: rec.humor.funny The following piece appeared on Page 1 of the Dec 5, '92 Globe & Mail - Canada's only national news paper.

While her younger, twin brothers (both called Stan, because Dad can't tell them apart) and sister Twanette run amok, Tharp becomes a baton-twirling, piano-playing, tap-and-ballet-dancing freak with weird friends. (Her first boyfriend killed the school coach with a shot put.)\" ==== Actually, I do have a comment, though not an observation about the review. I first heard Twyla Tharp's name when encountering one of my professors in a bookstore a few days before Christmas. He told me he was looking for a book about Twyla Tharp as a gift for his wife. Apparently I had trouble with this name, as that night I dreamed about someone named Thelma Twerp. ------------------------------ Date: Mon, 7 Dec 92 4:30:09 EST From: knodel@cis.ohio-state.edu (Jeff Knodel) Subject: What happens when you work all-night... Newsgroups: rec.humor.funny I work at <a utility company> that has security card readers on all of the entrances, exits, and important internal doors. Employees must have their creditcard-like ID cards to run across the scanner, or they cannot open the doors. This morning, a co-worker of mine left to run across the street to the gas station to pick up some candy bars and pops for all of us minding the fort. When he got back, however, he found that he could not work the door mechanism, hold the drinks, and his card up against the scanner at the same time. After a few trials, he managed to do it by holding the card against the scanner with his head, and turning the knob with the hands holding the drinks. He then walked through the entire length of the building, climbed three flights of stairs, and eventually came to the computer room, which again required his ID -- only he didn't have it. He sat the drinks on the ground, and searched his pockets; Nothing. \"Fine,\" he thought, \"I must have dropped it in he hall,\" So he backtracked all the way to the door, looking for places he might have dropped it; but no luck. He got to the front door, which had just been opened up by the morning security guard. \"Hi.\" he said to the guard, \"I was through here not five minutes ago.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"...but I can't, for the life of me, seem to find my ID.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I had it to get through the door, but I did not have it when I got to the next one.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I've backtracked my entire path, and I didn't find it.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Have you seen it?\" And the guard said; \"Its stuck to your forehead.\" ------------------------------ Date: Sun, 13 Dec 92 12:04:50 CST From: brennan@hal.com (Dave Brennan) Subject: What is Object-Oriented Programming?

It's because object-oriented programming is like having a bathtub filled with water, and the water has all these Objects floating in it, but none of the objects can communicate directly with the other objects because there are cardboard dividers also floating in the water between them, so each object can use a telephone to send a signal to a filing cabinet which opens one of its drawers and releases various [legal] chemicals into the water... ------------------------------ Date: Tue, 8 Dec 92 17:50:11 -0500 From: Patrick Tufts <zippy@berry.cs.brandeis.edu> Subject: where do I sign up? To: yucks TI: Vibrotactile stimulation enhances sexual response in sexually functional men: a study using concomitant measures of erection. AU: Rowland-DL SO: Arch-Sex-Behav. 1992 Aug; 21(4): 387-400 AB: The role of vibrotactile stimulation on the penis in producing erection was investigated in 34 sexually functional men. Subjects were presented with three stimulus segments: erotic video (VID); vibrotactile stimulation (VT) applied to the underside of the penis; and combined vibrotactile and erotic video stimulation (VID+VT). Maximum erectile response was recorded to each stimulus using both an erectiometer and a Barlow strain gauge. Self-reported sexual arousal and affective response to each stimulus segment were also obtained. Results indicated significant variation in erectile response and self-reported arousal over the stimulus segments. Erectile response was lowest to VT alone and highest to VID+VT for both erectile measures, although the pattern of change across stimuli was different for each measure. Self-reported sexual arousal was consistent with erectile measures, but the difference between VID and VID+VT was not statistically significant. VT stimulation alone was perceived as somewhat unpleasant; both VID and VID+VT were perceived as more pleasant than VT, but VID and VID+VT did not differ significantly from each other. This study demonstrates that, while not perceived as more pleasureable or arousing, VT stimulation on the penis combined with erotic video stimulation augments erectile response in functional men in a controlled laboratory situation. The possible use of this methodology for the improved study of men with sexual dysfunctions is discussed.

Not if you want your code to be portable to other compilers. Some compilers, notably gcc, have extensions to the language that make this kind of thing possible, but in the majority of implementations this code will result in undefined behavior. ------------------------------ End of Yucks Digest ------------------------------"
