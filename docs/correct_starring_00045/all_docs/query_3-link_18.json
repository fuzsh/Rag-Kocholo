        "text": "Post by StevePulaski on\n\nMad Max (1979)\n\nDirected by: George Miller\n\nRating: ★★½\n\nGeorge Miller's Mad Max is a pioneer in low-budget, action filmmaking, proving to mainstream audiences that multiple million dollar production budgets and advertising campaigns aren't a requirement when making a high-octane film. Even decades later, as Mad Max's once-crystal clear aesthetic has become more or less a representation of the sun-soaked age that one equates with seventies films, it manages to impress because of how coordinated the stunts had to be for reasons other than safety. Due to such a low budget (only around $400,000), stunts had to be done precisely right the first time, for reshoots were costly and unforeseeable with a menial budget.\n\nThis fact alone could've rendered Mad Max nothing more than an obscure foreign b-movie that was lucky enough to get a wider release in the United States. Even some of the most impressive b-movies - Duel and Killer Klowns from Outer Space come to mind in terms of trying to do a great deal with very little - went on to live in obscurity and merit little cultural impact. Mad Max is the epitome of a surprise hit, spawning not only a franchise, but a career for one of the most successful actors, writers, and directors in history.\n\nWe are plunged into a dystopian Australia in the not-so-distant future. Law and order, and society in general, has begun to break down in favor of chaos thanks to an energy crisis, leaving large metropolitan cities as the only ones who are able to survive. We spend most of our time in the Australian Outback, following a dangerous motorcycle gang known as The Acolytes as they terrorize passersby with their large vehicles and weaponry. At the center of all the camaraderie is Max (Mel Gibson), a police officer desperately trying to maintain structure and peace in his homeland. Soon after the chaos worsens, Max realizes that the only way to save his once peaceful homeland is to kill all the members of the motorcycle gang, led by two men known as \"Toecutter\" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry).\n\nMax's realization of the problem and method of action comes at the expense of his own personal ethics, which, we can kind of assume, were pacifistic up until this point. It's the classic case of a movie character being pushed to his limits, realizing that the only way to fight the power is to play along rather than sit back and hope everything will work itself out thanks to a lack of interference and increased passivity.\n\nGibson plays an intriguing character with a fascinating moral complex, who, unfortunately however, isn't explored as much as he could be. His moral dilemma is downplayed in favor of the violent scenarios often occurring on screen, so much so that there is a disconcerting lack of character interest for our title character. Furthermore, the film's pacing feels off for much of the film, leaving the first sixty or seven minutes sort of deciding between wading in the water and throwing caution to the wind. At times, in the beginning, we can see director/co-writer George Miller and James McCausland attempt to weave a slowburn pacing style in with Mad Max's increasing amount of blunt force. However, Miller and McCausland cannot seem to commit to one or the other, and that leaves a film that transitions back and forth from extreme action to a humble focus on Australia's barren landscape.\n\nThese changes take Mad Max down a few notches, especially considering that during these scenes of combat and action, we can't extract much else from them other than how brutal they can be. The moments spliced in between the action give us time to extract ideas, character traits, and personalities from those involved, and when there is a middling amount of that and displays of action impressive because of their spontaneity and capabilities, there's a looming emptiness to the film as a whole.\n\nMad Max gets a large amount of style points, however, on part of Miller, who directs it with complete conviction and a respect for Australia's elegant, natural beauty. We are thrown into this world feet first, given little time to learn the politics of the road before heavily-armed muscle cars and motorcycles roar past us. This narrative technique and the scenery, made attractive by its ugliness, all work in the film's aesthetic favor. There is an unshakeable level of menace and vengeance to this particular story that could've bled through in mass amounts had our title character been more of a character rather than a force, or, paradoxically, just a title.\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Hugh Keays-Byrne, and Geoff Parry. Directed by: George Miller.\n\nPost by StevePulaski on\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981)\n\nDirected by: George Miller\n\nMel Gibson returns as \"The Road Warrior\" known as Mad Max in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.\n\nRating: ★★★\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior, more or less, notably improves on its predecessor and this is evident from the first half-hour of the film. Rather than the inconsistently paced narrative we got in the first film, burdened by flash-in-the-pan action sequences and a cycle that ping-ponged between minimalist and blunt-force, director George Miller and the trio of writers (Terry Hayes, Brian Hannant, and Miller himself) have finally found the time and place when to do both and realize the series' potential to feature both styles. What unfolds is a film more carefully balanced and more kinetic in its energy than its predecessor.\n\nThe film concerns the same dystopian Australia as the first film, only this time, law and order has ceased to exist and gasoline is a nearly nonexistent commodity. Former Australian police officer Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) still roams the street as a vigilante, taking out the numerous violent gangs that have claimed highways as territory all over the country, with his dog and his sawed-off shotgun clinging to him. Max's latest responsibility is to defend a group of settlers, who are trying to protect a compound which houses dozens of vehicles and a substantial amount of fuel, despite marauders attempting to overrun it, at one point succeeding and killing all but one settler.\n\nWhile Mad Max felt like it was laying the groundwork for the series to operate on, etching in some social commentary in addition to illustrating its vast, barren setting, Mad Max 2 begins to pick up and actually have some fun with its premise. It's by no means reliant on momentarily substantive action, but it finds the charm in your average car chase, where the excitement is usually buried between two tons of clanking metal, fire, and murky camera shots.\n\nMiller's groundwork pays off for Mad Max 2, as we now know the setting we're working with and have more time to enjoy our outing with this particular effort. The film is almost entirely focused on Max and his dog, whether they be rescuing the settlers or engaged in a hot pursuit chase. The first film found itself more concerned with creating a dichotomous focus between Max and the motorcycle gang. Here, our focus is made more intimate, personal, and exhilarating thanks to it being limited in such a large world.\n\nFurthermore, Miller's action sequences are delivered with more polish than they were in the first outing. They're more entertaining, for one, as the stakes are raised (armored trucks, gasoline trucks, faster cars enter the mix) and the tension is more balanced. Miller and his writing team take time to build a sense of dread on the ground, when Max is ostensibly alone, and when he's on the road, engaged in a high-speed chase, Miller captures it with complete clarity. We are always aware of space during these action sequences (also thanks to the trio of editors, David Stiven, Michael Balson, and Tim Wellburn), never becoming lost in a shuffle of incoherence or absurd camera angles. The action sequences, especially when set against Dean Semler's beautiful cinematography, are absolutely elegant and pristine.\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior had quite a bit of polishing to do following the ho-hum effect Mad Max left. The simplicity and digestible nature of this film makes it all the more watchable, and the action sequences, combined with the sequences exploiting pure dread, work from the get-go. The film adheres mostly to the principles of older, American westerns while admirably playing its own game of dystopian hell, which works quite nicely thanks to the barrage of talent constantly on display.\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson. Directed by: George Miller.\n\nPost by StevePulaski on\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nDirected by: George Miller and George Ogilvie\n\nMel Gibson in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.\n\nRating: ★★\n\nThe third film in a series can make or break it. There's a wave of \"wow, we got this far?\" on part of the filmmakers and a wave of the \"I can't believe they're making another one\" on the audience, and, understandably, filmmakers and studios try to see if they can take the series in a different direction once making it a trilogy. The problem is that, with this change, while certain admiration comes into play for risk, the change in direction can often squander or lessen what was already built from the previous films and solidify the decision for moviegoers not to seek out any more films from that franchise. It happened with the Child's Play franchise and the Halloween franchise, and unfortunately, it had to happen with Mad Max.\n\nThe series, in my eyes, was never an amazing one, but had certain appeal. The first film took the bare basics of action filmmaking and predicated a frightening, if somewhat slight, dystopian story on the large canvas of a desert. Its sequel, however, kicked itself into high gear, formally asserting Mel Gibson's titular character as an action hero. The third film, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, takes a Return of the Jedi-style approach to the sequel, softening it a bit, decorating it in costumes, trying something completely different, and ultimately, leaving divided reactions in its rear-view.\n\nWhat was once a series about suspense and disorder in the middle of nowhere has descended into a film that takes the formula of an epic or a classic warrior tale with little effect. Beyond Thunderdome morphs into a film of silly costumes and scenery-chewing fluff rather than capitalizing off of what made the franchise so unique and, often times, quite mesmerizing.\n\nGibson returns in the titular role, this time exiled into the desert by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the ruler of Bartertown. While wandering through the desert, again, trying to remain alive and alert in a sea of chaos and disorder, Max stumbles upon the crashsite of a Boeing 747. The people inside the airplane are members of a Melanesian Cargo cult, many of whom children who act in primal behaviors. After protecting the villagers in the previous film, Max confronts himself in order to try and maintain order amongst the people and protect them, specifically the children, from the dangers of the gangs that lurk in the desert.\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome feels like a film that managed to escape the control of George Miller. The film feels hijacked by greater Hollywood forces, who, in turn, minimized the violence, turned down darker themes, and created a film much more concerned with the portrayal of people than the dangers that lurk in the desert. That would be understandable if the film wasn't burdened by a general sense of disconnect. Little human or character interest can be obtained from these characters, and Max feels as if he has transcended the realm of being an enigma to a completely artificial character, especially when cloaked in ridiculous costumes.\n\nAt this point, the franchise's different direction, equipped with more light-hearted scenes than the first two films and, for a while, what seems like low stakes suspense, especially in the middle portion of the film, does what I feared it would do and that's take it off course in hopes this particular move would pave the way for greatness. Unfortunately, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome suffers under the weight of its own ambitions and ideas, effectively creating something out of an original property that wasn't there to begin with. I'm sure if you told the Max from the first film he'd end up in the situations he finds himself in in this film, he'd laugh at you.\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson and Tina Turner. Directed by: George Miller."
