        "text": "The post-apocalyptic movie sensation that changed the look of Australian movies forever, Mad Max spawned two international blockbuster sequels and made a star of Mel Gibson. An apocalypse has devastated Australia and desolate stretches of outback highways have become bloodstained battlegrounds. After seeing fellow police officers and innocent citizens killed and raped by marauding gangs, disillusioned motorcycle cop Max Rockatansky (Gibson) wants to leave the carnage behind, retire and spend time with his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son. But, in one horrifying moment, his life is irrevocably shattered when the brutal Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his biker gang take action in retaliation for the death of a fellow gang member. Now, with nothing to lose, and savage revenge his only reason for living, ‘Mad’ Max is back on the highways. One fearless man taking on the terror head first, he will become forever known as “The Road Warrior”."
