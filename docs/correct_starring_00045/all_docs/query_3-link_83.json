        "text": "Whenever someone mentions running, usually the first words out of my mouth are \"I'm not a runner.\"\n\nI think from a very early age I told myself I would never run a marathon. I had read articles of the pain and seen pictures of people's toenails falling off or they themselves collapsing somewhere in the race. Not for me, no way, nu-uh.\n\nRewind to October 2021, I was heading down to South Pole, Antarctica to spend a year on ice. I remember 3 weeks of lazy MIQ doing acrobatics in my room and watching movies on discord with friends. The furthest thing from my mind was running. I remember landing on November 9th, 2021 in -50F (-45C) weather and each breath feeling like being punched in the throat. Now I just want to clear something up, even though I have always said I am not a runner, that doesn't mean I haven't run anything. My crazy Colorado friends (Max and Louis!) convinced me a few years ago to run the Blue Ridge Relay with them. My first ever race was a 200 mile relay race in the middle of the Blue Ridge Parkway with 6 other people. I was responsible for 30 miles of the race, It was exhausting, but it was a blast and I would do it again.\n\nAfter a few days of suffering at Pole (due to the altitude) I heard about their annual marathon coming up in about 8-10 weeks. Maybe I'm not a runner but I'm a sucker for a challenge. 8 weeks to train for a marathon at 9301 ft (2834m)? Count me all the way in. The first week you're not allowed to use the gym facilities due to altitude acclimatization. The second week I would get on the treadmill and walk for half a mile or a mile and get a pounding headache. By the third week I could run 3-5 miles during the week. Getting strong at an amazingly slow pace! The first few weeks while I waited for the weather to \"warm up\" was all on the treadmill. There were definitely about two weeks there where I just could not sleep due to the high altitude as well. Full on zombie mode and the only thing I would get done those days is do my job. Eventually it warmed up enough and I gathered the courage to start running outside. Even though I had been running 5-10 miles a week by that point, a mile outside was killer! Between the cold air at -20F (-7C) and the snowy texture it was a whole different beast. How was I going to do this? Eventually I built up to one or two 13 mile runs outside within those 8-10 weeks and I felt the most ready I would ever be. It took a long time running outside to understand what I needed to wear at which temperatures and wind speeds. How to protect my lungs from ice forming in them and what I could do to keep my goggles relatively clear. It was a huge learning experience on many different fronts.\n\nThe race course was set by our surveyor (thanks Nate!) and he set an awesome 6.55 mile loop which you needed to complete 4 of to nab the finish. I have included a picture of the course with this email, but I'm also going to describe it. We started and finished each lap at the ceremonial pole. Your first target was getting to the Atmospheric Research Observatory (ARO), then the geographic south pole, and then out to the ski loop. The ski loop was the worst part of the loop. They had tried to groom the path but did a little late. Each foot strike was a soft crust you would break through and your foot would immediately slide an inch. The first aid station was about 2 miles in, at the ski warming hut. Then the loop finished up around our RF Communications sector and back in towards the station. The second aid station was in the fuel barn, then the loop went out onto South Pole Overland Traverse (SPOT) road, doubling back, hitting the fuel barn again, and then back out to our Dark Sector Lab (DSL). Completing the loop out there and then finishing up at the ceremonial south pole.\n\nFinally after struggling for weeks I finally arrived at race day. I couldn't have prepared more unless I had run in my hotel room in San Fran and Christchurch. Some people did that, some people ran marathons while cooped up, those impressive kooks! Of course we had terrible weather for our marathon. The weather started at about -30F and kept dropping slowly throughout the race. The windchill at least was mild throughout the race, but the conditions were terrible. Our race course was a 6.55 mile loop, four of those would net you the marathon finish. During the first lap it was overcast conditions, meaning warmer weather, but no snow definition. You didn't know if your next step was 6 inches higher or 12 inches lower than what you were expecting. As we went out on our loop we hoped that the footprints would stay in the snow and we could at least make a trail to follow. We quickly realized this was false and you could see footprints disappearing in front of you as you ran. As I approached the first aid station on the ski loop I saw a few friends skip it and keep going, a big mistake is what I thought to myself as I went in for some hot water and cookies. The first lap was uneventful and I felt good.\n\nThe most awesome thing about this marathon was that it seemed to get all sorts of different weather patterns per lap. The first lap was overcast conditions, the second was a gorgeous blue bird day with some wind. I started feeling a little tired at the end of the second lap, but it wasn't too bad. The third lap conditions started to get interesting and a storm started to roll in. By this point the first finisher had crossed the finish line in 4 hours and 20 minutes. Brandon had just wintered over so he had been at Pole since last November. My pace started really suffering at that point and the weather was not helping. By the fourth lap it was a full blown almost whiteout storm on the ski loop approach. I started wondering whether I'd be forced to come off the course. I was 6.5 hours in at this point. \"Luckily\" I made it into the storm before the station leader could stop me. As I approached that first aid station, I ducked inside for some food and drink and because I could not see the next yellow flag. The water cooler was frozen by this point and the cookies frozen. I waited for a few minutes and started to get cold, as I peeked outside I saw a snowmachine approaching. It was Tim to the rescue! He asked me what my plan was and I told him I was waiting since I could not safely go on. I asked him to give me a mile ride closer to the station where the whiteout wasn't as bad and I would make up the distance at the end. He only agreed since mentally I still seemed to be doing really well and making good decisions. My good friend and work partner who had just been 5-10 minutes behind me had been pulled off the course by this point, I was the last participant left. In that mile snowmobile ride, my left shoe, which happened to be facing most of the wind, froze to my foot. I remember getting off the snowmachine and starting to walk slowly but surely trying to warm up and convince my body to keep running. Tim brought me a parka to walk in until the second aid station. I had less than 2 miles to go and I was exhausted. I went into the fuel barn to fuel up (HAHA!) and change some of the moist clothes out, then out and down SPOT road and then doubling back to the fuel barn. My colleague Moreno who had been cheering me on had fallen asleep inside. He had stopped after lap two due to too much sweating and freezing. I left the fuel barn and started up DSL road for my final push of the race.\n\nThis was my lowest low of the race. Not only was the DSL loop a pain to run because of the loose snow, but I had to make up a mile of race in the final leg. I had to be within clear sight of the station and the finish, where food and warmth were waiting, and will myself to turn around for half a mile and jog away from comfort. The hardest part was at any point in the race I was only a few minutes from it all stopping. The cold, the running, and the mental fatigue. Officially my time came out to 7 hours and 42 minutes. Technically a horrendous time, but I did a marathon at the South Pole!\n\nNow you would think I would have stopped running for a bit, but I actually kept running consistently throughout my winter. Not everyday and I had a few weeks of breaks, but enough to keep a decent foundation. I think the South Pole Marathon inspired me to try and tackle it again and get a much better finish. Being friends with Sarah Bouckoms also didn't help since she told me about Kepler and that sounded like it was right up my alley. She mentioned she had run it before, showed me pictures, and I convinced her to sign up for Kepler again. Training at the South Pole for Kepler has been nothing short of a struggle. Countless hours on a treadmill for weeks with no end in sight. I'm still not a runner, or am I?\n\nMarch 29, 2023\n\nHarriet Watson\n\nI have listened to your poddy forever and a day and have finally got around to submitting my own GRE!\n\nIn typical Watson fashion, we left the house about 5 minutes before we needed to be at the Torea Jetty – just a wee 20 minutes of brisk hill walking...away… So it was on to Mum’s bike for me, a fast trip up the hill (breathing through my eyeballs at this point), and a speedy roll down to the Jetty. All I had to do was stall the water taxi for few minutes while Mum and Dad ran across. I got there in record time (I didn’t actually have time to start the Garmin…) only for the boat to be about 10 mins late anyway… one hell of a warm up before a big day of running!!\n\nAn hours boat trip helped me to consider the beauty of the Sounds – it really is my favourite place to be. But it also gave me time to think… an hour on a boat seemed like a long time, how long was it going to feel running? The boat was also the point of no return. Once I was on, I had very few options but to make my way back to the bach on foot. So with the salty fresh air whisking past us, I had to fully commit (well… I was already on the boat and pretty committed at this point), to running the furthest distance I had ever attempted in one day (I hadn’t even run a marathon at this point, but here I was, considering 50odd kms).\n\nPrior to this mission on the Queen Charlotte Track, my longest ever run was the 33km through Goats Pass for the Coast to Coast race (back when I was 16). But that didn’t stop me from dreaming… just prior to this run on the Queen Charlotte track, I (ably assisted by my just-as-ambitious Dad) developed an idea for a fundraising run/bike event from Farewell Spit to Ross. Thriving in the challenge, in 2020, I kayaked 100km in a K1 racing boat and raised over $4300 for Endometriosis New Zealand. But this 650km running/biking mission is going to test me in ways I don’t even know about yet, and so ticking off the marathon distance, and the 50km in one day was probably a good place to start.\n\nSo given 33km is a pretty short run in the scheme of my December plans, I probably needed a good wake up call, and what better way to do it than in my favourite place, attempting my very first marathon distance, and ultra-marathon distance, all in one day!\n\nThe run started with a pre-departure nervous pee and an iconic selfie at Ships Cove. The steep start was enough to get the legs burning (especially after my unplanned bike sprint first thing), and the heart rate up. I started with the “whoop we’ve hit 1km”, “wahoo we made it 2kms”, but I quickly decided that was going to get old. I turned my attention to keeping an eye on the time. One key focus for me on adventures like this one, is eating every 20minutes. Just a bite of some sort of bar, or a swig of whatever drink mix I have in my bottle, is a non-negotiable for me. If I get hungry, or notice my energy lacking it is too late… my lesson has been learnt, so a religious focus on eating is what gets me through – an absolute gamechanger!!\n\nAnother gamechanger - we set out with the goal to complete the run, we all had headlights and plenty of food, so the day was about putting one foot in front of the other, having fun and going the distance. This mindset has developed for me. I used to think that all of my training sessions had to be 100% focused being the fastest, pushing the hardest or beating whatever I had achieved last time. The reality is, that’s just not sustainable. I learnt to change my focus – I still put 100% focus into my sessions, but that doesn’t always mean pushing myself to exhaustion (although I do enjoy those sessions too). Now my training load has all sorts of sessions, sometimes the focus is recovery, sometimes to lose track of time and just have fun, sometimes to build speed or endurance.\n\nSo this adventure was about having fun and going the distance…and it turned out to my favourite ever run!\n\nWe ticked away, 1km at a time, making it through all the nice lodges where bikers were parking up for the day. I distinctly remember as we filled our water supplies up at about km 17 at Fernaux lodge, we got chatting away to a group of mountain bikers who we had been passing and been passed by a number of times through this first stretch of the track. Noticing that we were filling our drinks up, and not stopping for a coffee (or a cocktail) like they were, one of them asked “where are you heading to”. Our response of “Portage” was received with some startled steers – it began to dawn on me that I might be slightly crazy!\n\nBut, I am my father’s daughter, so at least I had someone just as crazy to run the rest of the way with. Trotting through a nice flattish bit of the track, we finally made it to Punga Cove (one of those times where you see your destination for a longggg time before you eventually reach it!). A water fill up, and bit of a lunch stop was wrapped up with goodbyes to Mum as she set off along the road for the rest of the way – being the best support crew, she was determined to be home and have a hot dinner waiting for us when we finished – what a gem!\n\nThe climb out of Punga Cove had never seemed so steep. It just seemed to go on and on, but I suppose that’s what you’re in for when you’ve already done 30something kms for the day! We just trucked along – admiring the sun across the beautifully flat water as it was coming down for the evening. By this point we (mostly me) had started to lose the plot a bit – poor old Dad had to suffer through a few of my jokes.\n\nAll tough bits and terrible jokes aside, I was quietly stoked with how the body was feeling at this point. During this section of the run, I was officially crossing into uncharted territory – after 33km, every step took me to the furthest distance I had ever run… and to my surprise I was still running (not crawling, hobbling, or even walking)!! I had half (maybe more like 75%) expected to be well and truly aching at every step, or at least feeling the effect of 30 something kms of pounding on a track. I had an old hip-flexor injury which had given me grief in May, but to my pleasant surprise, none of these things were affecting me.\n\nYears of immersing myself in resources to help me be the best athlete I could possibly become had exposed me to podcasts where athletes explained the ‘flow state’ where everything feels like it just comes together. And as we ticked off those kms that day, I was sure I had found my flow state. I just felt like I was floating along. It wasn’t easy, but it certainly didn’t feel as hard as I thought it should. But needless to say, I was trying to put those thoughts aside – still more than 10kms to go as the saying goes – it’s not over till the fat lady sings!\n\nBy km 40 I was emotionally starting to wear the effects of the day. My body and mind were feeling strong and happy attacking the task at hand, but I was getting pretty emotional. And anyone who knows me, knows when I’m emotional, I don’t hold the tears back very well. So you can imagine when at km 42.1 when dad stopped running, started walking, put his arm around me, watched his Garmin tick over to 42.2km and said “well done on your first marathon girl”, the eyes suddenly got a bit foggy.\n\nWe carried on running – me with one of the most heart-filled smiles ever on my face – what a special moment I had just shared with one of my number 1 supporters!! Step by step we chipped away, until km 49.9 when I stopped running, started walking, put my arm around Dad, watched my Garmin tick over to 50.0km and said “thanks for sharing my first 50km with me Dad”. Wowee – foggy eyes again!\n\nFrom there, on a familiar part of the track, it was almost a bit of a race against the clock to get back before the sun went too far down. We weren’t so worried about running in the dark but we had plans to get back in time to sit in the ocean for a natural ice bath.\n\nWhen we got back to the house, Mum had dinner pretty much ready, we had a wee dip in the sea and I had a huge smile on my face. Not only had I just completed a big old run, but I had my best run I think I had ever had, and I felt like this ambitiously crazy ultra-running fundraising project might actually be achievable after all. Safe to say I slept well that night – and with a big smile on my face too!\n\nFor reference – the details of the fundraising project can be found at @hazzas_run_4_endo\n\nMarch 15, 2023\n\nJared Schnell\n\nHere’s the story of my greatest run ever:\n\nAfter a season of working excessive and unusual hours I decided it was time to recharge the\n\nbatteries and headed off on a solo tour the South Island sightseeing, surfing and running.\n\nI had a goal of doing a sunrise mission during the trip and the opportunity presented itself in the last few days - Mt Fyffe in the Kaikōura Ranges. I wasn’t sure how long the ascent will take me, so with a few hours’ sleep, I woke up unnecessarily early and got going.\n\nI thought I was going to miss the sunrise so powered up the hill with tunnel vision – I am going to make it before the sun – ignoring the usual strains us Northerners get in the Southern Ranges.\n\nI arrived at the top of Mt Fyffe under the cover of darkness, there was still at least an hour before dawn. At that point I decided to find a comfortable shrub hidden from the wind, rug up warm, eat some food and wait.\n\nEventually the sun edged over the horizon casting light on the sleepy town below and illuminated the mountains with shades of red and orange - my cup was immediately full. Once the sun was up, I continued along a saddle and up Gambles End – two peaks for the price of one.\n\nAt this point I had run for about two hours and had covered over half my anticipated distance, only the downriver to go. As you always expect, the mountains own you and I soon realised I had a long journey still to go.\n\nI spent many hours clambering over boulders, along tributaries and through dense sections of scrub as the Kowhai River formed. There we’re plenty of slips, trips and falls, many river crossings and a skinny dip in one of the tributaries.\n\nEight and a half hours later I made it back to the car, a very happy chappy feeling very privileged to have the ability and opportunity to spend time in the South Island hills. A great way to finish off the battery recharge and by far my greatest run ever.\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nToni\n\nIt’s Wednesday, two days ago I returned to New-Zealand after visiting my family in Europe for the first time in two and a half years. The holiday has been amazing, filled with love, good food, great runs and activities.\n\nI’m living on a high and ready to get back into things over on this side of the globe.\n\nI’ve just finished my first run back in NZ when my girlfriend calls me. “I think my car has been stolen!” She’s calm, I’m not. Selfish as I am in the moment, I immediately realise that I’d left quite a bit of my gear in her car, since we’re still moving places as I don’t really have my own place to stay at. “ F***, all my stuff is in your car, you sure you didn't park it somewhere else?!.” Followed by a few more words that shouldn’t be repeated. I realise that I’m not giving her the most empathic reaction and ask her how she is. She’s alright, and surprisingly strong and calm. I hang up and I get on my way to pick her up. It’s that moment when it hits me: “ my camera, my laptop.” I’m not sure if I’ve ever screamed that hard. I break down in tears as I try to keep the car on the road.\n\nI feel a pain I’ve never really felt before. It’s not that I’m a materialistic person but I realise that there’s a lot of very valuable photos of family on both laptop and camera. I’d forgotten to take them out of her car earlier that day. As she left the driveway in the morning I realised and tried to call her, I needed them for today. As I’m dialling her number I get the message that I don’t have enough credit left: “Shit”. There’s no wifi either at the gorgeous Airbnb we’re staying..\n\nThere’s nothing I could’ve done. It’s this mixture of unfortunate events though that will mess with me for a few days.\n\nThe list of missing items is long, a backpack full of pretty much all my outdoor clothes. Jackets, socks, bike clothing, run clothing, mountaineering clothes, thermals, a brand new down sleeping bag that was a farewell present from my parents and who knows what else. Luckily my new running shoes were in another bag.\n\nMonday comes around. After a few days of mourning and trying to be optimistic the training schedule reads: Race simulation. 5 hours of fun. I laugh. It also reads: “ wear everything you’re going to wear and use on Raceday.” I don’t have much choice coach. I’ve got 1.5 pairs of socks left, 1 pair of running shorts, 2 shirts to choose from and no mandatory gear. I think I’ll just go with what I have for now.\n\nI'll run at my local favorite, Tawharanui. I load up my hydration pack, which I fortunately still have and wait in the car until the rain stops. It’s windy, a bit stormy even, I’m surrounded by dark clouds and only sometimes there’s some sun piercing through the clouds. I’d like to start when it’s dry so I can warm up a bit, as I have no clothes to keep me warm or dry.\n\nI find my window of opportunity and start running. It’s after 20 minutes when the first rain hits me, but I don’t care anymore. I’ve warmed up and am in a good headspace, the muddy K’s tick away and I’m smiling.\n\nMy thoughts get clearer, my smiles get bigger. Birds chirp away and the list of species I see gets longer and longer. There’s nobody around and I’m completely zoned out until a fat Kereru scares the hell out of me as it decides to take off right next to my head. A little while later a seal does the same to me as I run too close past a Harakeke it’s lying under. It gives me a loud roar, I jump. The extra adrenaline gets me through the last couple of beautiful Kilometres and I finish the run with exactly 5 hours and 47k’s on the Suunto.\n\nI decide to go for a swim to cool down the legs and wash off the mud and probably loads of sheep and cow poo. It is however not only that I wash off. It feels like a page has been turned. I’ve run and washed off all the frustrations, anger, sadness and pain. I’m filled with positivity again as I sit in the sun, eating my pasta and tuna, listening to the waves crashing onto the pebbled beach.\n\nIt’s those moments you realise again that life is beautiful in all its simplicity. I’m privileged I have the health, time and money to go for long runs in gorgeous environments. And it reminds me that you don’t need much to feel fulfilled and happy. The runners high keeps surprising me every time, again and again. For this year this might be my greatest run ever. I'll keep reminding myself whenever, sad, mad or whatever, get out there!\n\nI hope my outdoor gear is not thrown away and put to good use by somebody else whoever it might be and maybe even lets somebody else have a greatest run/hike ever. Who knows. It’s something I hope everybody will experience once. As for the missing photos, the memories are still in my heart, maybe we should live in the moment a bit more. For now, I’ll be chasing more adventures, more memories and I hope whoever reads or hears this will do the same. Have fun out there and be well.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nBeth\n\nI’m from across the ditch on the Central Coast of NSW. (Don’t hold that against me!) I love your show and the amazing stories you and your guess tell. They really inspire me on more then just a fitness level.\n\nI have been wanting to write about my run for a long time time now but didn’t think my story is anywhere near as epic as others I have heard.\n\nBut it’s my story, and it’s pretty important to me.\n\nIt was the year 2020 which for so many people was a year of disruption and change.\n\nFor me it was also the year that my life fell apart.\n\nMy husband of 10 years told me he was having an affair (with his running partner) right before we went into lock down.\n\nWe were in the same house, trying to figure out what our future held for our family while not being able to see or hug others around us. I kept so much to myself in those first few months knowing that it would hurt my family and friends so much to hear how much I was hurting, but they could do nothing about it, not even visit me and definitely not hug me.\n\nSo I ran. I already had a love for running, but it became my true therapy. My physical and emotional outlet when there was so few other options. I was really fit. The fittest I’d ever been.\n\nEventually I moved out to my own little place right near the lake. It was my little sanctuary for myself and my 2 young boys. It was a chance for us both to have some space and decide where to from here.\n\nA week after I moved out was Mother’s Day. My ex offered to have me over for dinner after my shift at work so the boys could see me.\n\nWhen I got there by gorgeous boys told me all about their day and how they had been with their dad and the lady he had an affair with.\n\nMy heart was shattered all over again. I know that this was definitely the end of my marriage. I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t eat.\n\nI wanted to feel something else. I needed for my heart and my body to match.\n\nI remembered a quote ‘if you want to run, run a mile. If you want to change your life, run a marathon’\n\nI wanted to change my life so badly.\n\nSo on no sleep. No food. With no planing. I decided to run around the lake. In my many hours of not sleeping a calculated that it was 45kms by road around the lake.\n\nI called in sick to work, strapped on my shoes and grabbed whatever hydration/food I could find.\n\nI took off. I was flying. The fastest kms I’d ever done. I’d remind myself to slow down, but legs just couldn’t!! My heart just pushed my body further and faster.\n\nThe kms just kept disappearing I was flying. I didn’t need to stop. I just wanted to keep going. At 30kms I started to break. I was tired and emotional. I had nothing left. I’d never run that far before. But I had to get home. I thought of calling someone for help. But knew I’d regret it later.\n\nSo on I went. At 38kms I ran out of food and hydration. I still had 7kms to go!\n\nSo I shuffled. And I shuffled.\n\nEventually my house was in view. I looked at my watch and realised that if I dug deep I might actually make the 45kms in under 5 hours.\n\nSo with cramping calves I attempted to sprint! Oh man I wish there was a video of that. I would have looked a lot like a baby giraffe trying to run moments after birth!!!\n\nBut I did it. 45kms in 5 hours with 4 seconds to spare.\n\nFinally. My body was as broken as my heart.\n\nThere was such satisfaction and healing in that pain. It was the equilibrium I had needed for months and showed me that I can survive and I can dig deep. Even when I have nothing left to give. Physically or emotionally.\n\nI’ve never needed to run that way again. My healing has been such a hard but rewarding journey. But that run was the start of my healing. Strange how sometimes we need to be completely broken to rebuild.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\nRyan Abrey\n\nI thought of this while listening to one of the others.\n\nOne of my greatest runs ever, took place way back in 2016 when I was asked to run the African X with my friend Steven Teuchert as one of the \"Every Day Runners\" of the Windhoek Light sponsored team.\n\nThis was a three day event with runs in the Elgin near Cape Town, which ended up with 98km on rolling hills totalling 2,600m of ascent. In the morning we ran finishing at the event area where we spent the rest of the day relaxing, eating together, enjoying our one free sports massage and finishing up camping at the same place.\n\nWhat made it so special was that we were running as teams and while I was well into training for another race, Steven was recovering from a rolled ankle so racing was not a goal, but rather meeting people, enjoying the amazing scenery of the Cape and having a bit of a party on the way. One moment I won't forget was reaching one of the highest points on the route and jogging along singing Bohemian Rhapsody to the amusement of some around me, and the annoyance of those really out of breath.\n\nAs a team event it was also great being there for a friend who was struggling in pain but being able to stick with him and support him to finish each day. And while our times were not the best, the memories made will always be recalled fondly.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023\n\nHenry Goldstein\n\nMy racing buddy Bryan and I recently finished our first Miler, the Brisbane Valley Rail Trail, in June. Despite living at separate ends of Queensland, him in Cairns and me in Brisbane, and quite separate training styles and schedules, we’ve been running marathons and ultras together for the last 5 years. Even though we race together, we’ve rarely had the opportunity to train together or do a proper recce run, but for the miler, we made it happen.\n\nFor the recce, we decided to park up at Esk, and run the last 65km to the end of the course using the same timing as we’d expect for the race. To complicate things, Bryan was arriving via a two week trip to South Africa and two days at a masters rowing regatta. The shared ability to suffer is something we have in common.\n\nAfter a long drive and a meal at the Linville Hotel we were shivering in our sleeping bags in the van at Esk by 8pm. At the exact moment I fell asleep, the alarm went off for the midnight run. We faffed around. Extra gels, extra layers on, then off again. We genuinely discussed just getting another three hours kip and driving down the road to the next aid station. I’d never even contemplated welching on a run like this before, something was afoot.\n\nBry suggested we run the first 3 km and if it was still unbearable, we’d turn around, and so we trotted along the trail through the damp grass, ticking off the 1km markers.\n\nAt 4km, we saw a koala, and things seemed to be going well or well enough. We ran low on water through Coominya around 24km, and pushed on for Lowood, a further 12 km on.\n\nUsually, a run at 3AM has that heightened awareness of things beyond bushes and whispers at the edge of vision, even for experienced shift-workers.\n\nBut that night, with an easy rhythm and the gravel crunching quietly underfoot, a still night and clear sky with a galactic core on full display, I experienced my greatest run ever. Everything was clear. The sounds held no surprises. For four mind-warping kilometres across the flood plain, time stood still and there was an endless sky absent the moon, but stars so thick and bright we could turn off the head lamps and move across the land as if ghosts, bearing witness to something far greater than ourselves.\n\nWe made it to Lowood just before first light, and later stopped in at the legendary Fernvale bakery for fresh cinnamon buns, before the last 20km steamy stomp to Wulkuraka in good enough shape.\n\nWhen we returned in June I was looking forward to the floodplain, but we were instead met by thick fog. After we trudged through the same section well ahead of our goal time, our support crew patched us up and on we went to the finish with family and friends in attendance.\n\nThe miler was amazing, but those four kilometres of the recce run remain my greatest run ever.\n\nJanuary 25, 2023\n\nChris Flack\n\nThe sun is setting. I’m deep into loop ten of my first backyard ultra. I’ve made my goal of running from sunrise to sunset but for it to really count I have to complete this loop. I’m tired and actually come to think of it… I'm exhausted.\n\nI started running nearly 9 hours ago. My hands are freezing, my ankles are sore and I can just manage a slow shuffle in those moments when my legs aren’t both cramping. My feet feel like they are burning and my entire body wants to give up.\n\nI look at my watch. I’ve got just under 2kms to go to complete the 6.7km loop. And there is 14 mins until the cut-off. Any other day that would be easy. BUT this isn’t any other day.\n\nI do some quick maths in my head. I need to run slightly quicker than 7min/ks to get back to the start within the hour and for the loop to count.\n\nMy mind drifts back to the start of the day to attempt to block out the pain.\n\n***\n\n“3… 2…. 1… go…”\n\nAnd like that 118 of us move forward into complete darkness.\n\nThe only things visible is our breath and the small area in front of us lit up by our headlamps.\n\nThe sun is not due to rise for another 30 mins.\n\nAnd with that the hope that the temperature will rise as well.\n\n***\n\nArgh!\n\nMy mind is jolted back to the present moment by a sharp pain in my legs.\n\nMy right leg cramps.\n\nI hit it with my fist.\n\nMy left leg cramps.\n\nI hit it with my fist.\n\nI’m not sure if I've got it in me.\n\nMy mind tells me to give up.\n\n“Just walk, you don’t need to complete this loop”\n\n“No one really cares”\n\nI tell myself what I had been telling everyone else all day.\n\n“Just one more loop mate…. Just one more loop”.\n\nI come around a corner and then onto a wide dirt path. I try and eat some chips to ease the cramping in my legs. I force my legs to move forward.\n\n12 mins until cut off.\n\nI see another runner. He looks like he is in a lot of pain.\n\nI tell him “come on mate, just more loop”\n\nHe smiles gingerly back at me.\n\nI hobble over some small hills.\n\nThe same very hills that I power walked with ease for most of the last 8 hours or so.\n\nMy legs start to feel a little better.\n\n10 mins to go.\n\nI reach the boardwalk and try everything I can to get my legs to move faster.\n\nIt's like they are stopped in a time warp not wanting to listen.\n\nThere is no one else around. Just me and the sound of my feet as they hit the boardwalk.\n\nThump… thump.\n\nThump… thump.\n\nI pass the 6km sign.\n\n7 mins to go.\n\nIt’s now or never.\n\nI manage to move from a shuffle to a fast walk.\n\nI know soon that I’ll be able to get a glimpse of the finish line as the track snakes back and forth. I’ll be able to hear the voices just out of reach.\n\n5 mins to go.\n\nI cross a small bridge.\n\nI can now see the finish line.\n\nI can hear the voices getting excited for the start of the next lap.\n\nThese voices have no idea that I’m out there fighting the battle.\n\nI’m thinking I can do this.\n\nBoth legs cramp up.\n\nI’m thinking I can’t do this\n\nI hit both of them with my fists.\n\n4 mins to go.\n\n400m to cover.\n\nI’m moving as fast as I can.\n\nI’m parallel with the finish line. Hidden from view by a series of trees.\n\n3 mins to go.\n\n300 long meters to cover.\n\nDaylight is fading.\n\nI make out a shape in front of me.\n\nIt’s another person.\n\nMy legs are so excited they kick up a gear.\n\nHe looks tired.\n\nI yell out “You can do it mate, we can do it!”.\n\nHe nods back tiredly.\n\n2 mins.\n\n200 m.\n\nI approach the last corner which then turns sharply into a gravel road.\n\nI know once I’m around that corner there is only 100m to go.\n\nAnd very soon I will be in full view of everyone waiting to start the next lap.\n\nI turn the corner and hit the gravel road with pace.\n\nMy body has momentarily forgotten that it has been running for nearly 9 hours.\n\nAnd has finally decided that it remembers how to run.\n\n90 seconds\n\n100m.\n\nI might actually make it.\n\nThe crowd notices my head torch coming towards them in the distance.\n\nThe cheer gets louder and louder.\n\nI tell myself\n\n“C’mon, C’mon… you got this”\n\n60 seconds\n\n50m.\n\nI can see the giant clock as I get closer.\n\nIt's pulling me into its glow.\n\nI keep running as fast as I can as I can’t trust my tired eyes.\n\nI can see the finish line.\n\nI can see peoples’ faces they are willing me on.\n\nI look up at the large digital clock.\n\n56 seconds left\n\nI make one big final surge to get across the line.\n\nThe crowd cheers.\n\nI raise my arms to celebrate in disbelief.\n\nI’ve made it with 53 seconds to spare.\n\nThe crowd cheers again.\n\nI think it's for me.\n\nI look to my left.\n\nAnother person has just finished as well.\n\nWe tiredly nod at each other.\n\nI hunch over in the corral.\n\nI’m so exhausted I feel like crying.\n\nThe whistle goes for the start of the next loop.\n\nThe race director yells ”Just one more loop!”\n\nI take a couple of steps forward and I realise I’m done.\n\nI’ve found my limits.\n\nAnd for now, this is it.\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\nJasmine\n\nI was stuck in Auckland where we were in lockdown for months, staying home while all our friends around the country were having adventures. Being a first responder I was lucky to be able to still get out of the house and go to work but that can still lead to lockdown fatigue which from what I could tell was a problem not just for me but for most Aucklanders.\n\nNow that omnicron had taken hold we’re no longer locked down and confined to one city. We can travel and even though we can’t race we can still have adventures.\n\nI had been training for the Tarawera miler which was understandably cancelled, once this happened I finally admitted the inevitable. I need a break.\n\nSo I took one, I put my coaching on hold and booked a whole lot of leave at work, little adventures here and there to keep me outside and keep me sane. This one wasn’t supposed to be a run, I was supposed to be walking the Abel Tasman track with a friend but she pulled out due to injury. I still wanted to go so decide to make it a fast packing mission.\n\nI never done fast packing before but have always been intrigued by it, I love tramping and I love trail running so why not mix them together, so I stuffed 3 days worth of gear into a 20L backpack and jumped on a plane down to Nelson.\n\nThe next day I was off. I took a water taxi to Apple Tree Bay and started my run there, it was a nice easy day, approximately 18km and taking in the views of the coastline. I immediately fell in love with the Abel Tasman Coastline taking in the views and taking breaks in the cool clear waters (which are cold by Auckland standards). I made it to the first hut at Bark Bay and spent rest of the day on the beach and watching the cheeky little Wekas trying to steal bits of food or cups of water off the other trampers.\n\nAfter a nights sleep I got up early and was off again, today I had 31kms to cover. I got to Awaroa Hut before low tide, so had a quick break and sat with the others while we watch some trying to cross early, basically ending up fully submerged in the inlet packs and all. I made the wise idea to wait and crossed while it was knee deep.\n\nThe rest of the day was like a dream, out in a new area exploring and just doing what I love. Stopping to take advantage of the waters and chatting to other trampers.\n\nI made it to the last hut in just over 5 hours with plenty of daylight to spare and made some friends for the night as trampers trickled in throughout the evening. We spent the night talking about other adventures we had done and what we had planned coming up.\n\nDay 3 was a much easier 5km over the hill to where I was being picked up. I had just ticked off my first great walk and my first ever fast pack. This may not just be one single run but a few days of running. Afterwards I was refreshed, inspired and ready for my next adventure and that is what makes it my greatest run ever.\n\nJanuary 11, 2023\n\nLaura Matthews\n\nMy greatest run ever: Krayzie’s Midwinter Backyard Ultra\n\nI’ve been curious about the backyard format for a while and was pretty excited to take part. After an icy drive from the West Coast, I turned up for registration in the afternoon. I was both impressed and intimidated by the epic aid stations being put up around me, and had a growing sense of imposter syndrome looking at all the real proper ultra-runners milling about. I parked my little van up and settled in for the night.\n\nI awoke in frost coated darkness on Saturday morning and tucked into a breakfast of maccas hash browns that my boyfriend/crew had nipped out to find. The race started with women first, so as one of the 26 ladies entered, I sheepishly made my way to the start line, trying not to think about the many hours ahead.\n\nLap one started and off we went. At 4km we hit the sand dunes right as the sun was popping up. Stoke was high. Everything was good.\n\nThe first 5 laps felt great. I enjoyed the chat around me (“If I reach 10 laps I’ll be doing a beer per lap from there!”) and met some epic people who made the hours and kilometres fly by.\n\nBy lap number 7 the brief moments of walking on the course started feeling a bit too good. During lap 8 my guts decided to stop cooperating. The brilliance of the backyard ultra is that you can nip off to the loo every hour.\n\nBy lap 10 I was tired. My boyfriend had set up an epic aid station complete with pot plants, candles and hot food. I almost threw up at the offer of instant rice and managed to force down half a Gu.\n\nLap 11 felt bad. The first 500 meters I felt stiff, sore and nauseated. It was really cold. A guy sprinted in at the end of lap 13 with 2 seconds to go. We all cheered. I decided I couldn’t quit just yet.\n\nI made it to the end lap of 15 with a few minutes to spare. I walked straight to the timing desk and with relief told them ‘I’m out.” George McNeur called me over. I was bracing myself for a speech about “one more lap” but he gave me a hug instead.\n\nI had absolutely no business running 100km but loved every minute it. Despite not knowing anyone else racing I felt super welcomed and inspired by everyone around me. The next day I got a message from another runner who I hadn’t met, saying my energy helped him get to 100km when he wanted to give up. How great is the running community!\n\nJanuary 4, 2023\n\nRich Lyon\n\nI am not a runner.\n\nI had never really enjoyed running, but in my early 20’s I ran a couple of half marathons, more out of boredom than anything, as my older sister was an avid runner at the time.\n\nFast forward nine years, and I had only been for two or three 5km runs in almost a decade. Then I started a new role for work and the culture was very inclusive, with plenty of banter and cheeky sledging concerning all things fitness, and before long a work run club was formed.\n\nAfter just a few months, our run club had 20-30 members and running at lunch with colleagues or in the evenings to edge up the rankings on our Strava’s run club leader board became a regular occurrence.\n\nOver the next twelve months, my colleagues and I would do the occasional fun run or half marathon in and around Auckland and it dawned on me that I had never attempted a full marathon and it was time to get the monkey off my back.\n\nIt was early 2020, I had just turned 35 and my sights were set on the Auckland Marathon later in the year. The goal was set, and in true fashion, I told my work colleagues that I had signed up and as the date got closer, I informed everybody of my goal time to keep myself accountable to train and avoid the embarrassment of coming up short of my goal.\n\nIn the lead up I consumed myself with all things running. Learning about injury prevention, fuelling techniques, speed and hill training, negative splits and simply focusing on building a solid base. I listened to every running podcast and was also introduced to Dirt Church Radio at this time by a friend. I spoke with everybody that I knew who had completed a marathon and asked them what they would do differently if they ran it again, to slowly develop my own recipe for success - A shout out to my former colleague and ultra-runner Tracy Benjamin who gave me such a great steer to plan for the big day and encouraged me to trust my training and stick to executing my plan.\n\nAs the weeks got closer, it was common knowledge around the office that I was aiming for a time of 3 hours and 45 minutes for my first marathon attempt but to a few close friends, 3 hours 40 mins would be my perfect race if I managed to execute on the day.\n\nAfter 11 weeks, 42 runs and 460km on the clock, I was ready. The bag-drop was done, the gun went bang and I was off. The scene at dusk was incredibly calm, just thousands of runners side-by-side wanting to give it their all as the sun started to rise over Rangitoto. Running through the streets of Devonport was great, I paced myself and held back the entire time, smiling as I let hundreds of runners pass me while I kept telling myself “negative splits, negatives splits”. Passing a colleague at Smales Farm who simply shouted “Stick to the plan, Rich, stick to the plan” just spurred me on and it was a relief to get over the bridge and head back towards Victoria Park to approach the halfway mark.\n\nThe next 9km just cruised by as I slowly edged up my pace to capitalise on the reserves that I had banked in the first half, by 30km I had finally caught up to the official pacer for my goal time. I had been told by so many that the race doesn’t start until you reach 30km so for the first time in the race, I put on my music and settled in, it was business time!\n\nAt the 34km I experienced some minor cramp for 20 seconds but I pushed on through as I ran to the beat. The feeling of running at the pace you had trained for, supported by so many random strangers in the crowd, on a beautiful sunny day, was simply magical. On target for 3 hours and 39 minutes, it was somewhat comical that I cramped one more time and had to stretch out my calves on the side of the road for 60 seconds, from then on, I sprinted at a tempo pace towards the CBD. The last one kilometre was electric, I was passing people left right and centre as the crowd steered and cheered at the chap with headphones that was sprinting home; quite the contrast to the other tired faces who had come out of the block storming in the first half of the run. The final sprint on the Vic Park grass was tiring and as I came around the final bend, I saw my wife and three daughters cheering me on, I crossed the line at my goal pace and finished in 3 hours 40 minutes, I was absolutely spent but absolutely stoked.\n\nSome 18 months later after my perfect race, in early 2022, I realised the importance of this race to me. My first marathon had given me so much confidence and strength on how to approach my running and life’s obstacles. So much so that I was about to begin this year training for my first ultra, the Taupo 50km (cancelled from the year prior due to Covid) but instead my family’s life was turned upside down as we tragically and unexpectedly lost one of the closest people in our lives leaving a gaping hole in our hearts. The world stopped, everything stopped and of course the running stopped. Not a single run, for 3 months as we struggled to adjust to our new normal.\n\nFast forward to today, I have been back running again for 2 months, I’ve run a couple of small trail runs and the training has once again begun for the Taupo ultra. When I look back at how far off course I was this year, and how far there is still to go, I realise that my race almost 18 months ago, my first marathon, my greatest run ever, has given me the strength to continue, the strength to face times of struggle and adversity but also the courage to chase the things you enjoy.\n\nI am now a runner!\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nChris Horan\n\nMine is more a small series of runs. I was house-sitting at a friend's place in Taupō and began going out for runs from this unfamiliar neighbourhood. I found a trail between the streets in a gully so headed down to check it out. It was overgrown, with big trees and felt like the wilderness. That short trail led onto another and another until I'd reached the lakefront. I ran home back up the trails thinking it felt like the wild but still in town.\n\nThe next run I went a different way and found more of these 'secret' wilderness trails. It became my mission to find as many as I could. Eventually over the 3 weeks of house sitting I managed to link up a 10km loop through town that avoided all roads! I was stoked. I felt like a Little kid finding treasure each time I found a new trail.\n\nI now appreciate the micro adventures one can have just by looking around the neighbourhood. I even made a presentation at Toastmasters about these trails and micro adventures in your neighbourhood.\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n\nEmily Marfell\n\nI feel a bit greedy having a go at another Greatest Run Ever. So this one is short and sweet. It falls into a few sub-genres, including ‘marine animal’ and ‘greatest teacher-only-day run’.\n\nI got out early in the dark on my favourite 12km farm loop. It was, as mentioned, a teacher only day, so I had winged time off work to hang out with my 6 and 8 year old sparks. It was a perfect freestyle day with no set plans, and could include bug hunting, jigsaw puzzling and adventuring up the creek. To make it even better, I was keen to get some endorphins and stretch my legs first.\n\nThis was a November morning; dawn was getting earlier everyday, and the promise of summer was real. I put in a moderate effort up the grassy climbs and then was rewarded as I cruised around the smoothed skinny sheep tracks towards the beach. Out in front of me the orange glow turned a tinfoil flat Cook Strait from monochrome to colour.\n\nI made it down to the pebbled beach and today it was lapping rather than raging. I was stoked to find that the tide was out, so I could pin my ears back and do my best fake Kipchoge charge along the hard, angled grey sand.\n\nUp ahead something unusual caught my eye. It was moved like something alive and yet it looked like a broken umbrella, rolling about in the gentle waves. Next thing, I was standing over a little blue penguin, a kororā. He wasn’t really moving too well and it was evident that he’d broken his leg. Without thinking much I whipped off my singlet and wrapped him up like fish and chips, and\n\nmorphed into Dan Carter, running home with the little blue tucked under my arm.\n\nThe children were into it. In seconds, out came a cardboard box, sprinklings of lawn clippings, a saucer of water, and some towels. The good towels for guests were sent back, to be replaced by old towels. Then we began a social media hunt to find someone to help Pebble. (Please note, we had no idea if he was a he, and he didn’t tell us, so we were being presumptuous, we hope that’s okay.)\n\nPretty soon, we had found ourselves the best adventure. It transpired that the place for him was the EcoWorld Aquarium in Picton, an hour’s drive away. So, after Weetbix, teeth and shoes, we were off. We ran some errands on the way and you should’ve seen the shop guy’s eyes when he was told, matter of factly, that we had a penguin in the boot. He had to come out to have a disbelieving look.\n\nAt the Aquarium the kind staff inspected Pebble. They decided that he was very skinny and weak, and agreed his leg was broken. They took him out the back to the staff only area (we were allowed to go too) and put him in a special warming box. That was the last we saw of Pebble. He was flown to the amazing Te Kohanga animal hospital at Wellington Zoo, where they operated and successfully pinned his leg. Sadly, some weeks later, he succumbed to a respiratory infection. We found out that the warmer sea temperatures had been hard on seabirds, as the fish were deeper and the birds were not able to feed as easily, so they were in poorer condition. Despite the sad ending it was a wonderful way to learn about this. We didn’t know all of that at the time though. Job done, we had a happy wander on the Picton Foreshore, terrorised the amazing pirate ship playground, and demolished some sausage rolls on the way home.\n\nA teacher only day to remember, and it all started with one of those ‘Greatest Runs’ that you hope you get to do a thousand times again.\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\nLogan Griffin\n\nMy partner and I have both had a tough run (excuse the pun) with injuries over the last couple years and have never really had the chance to run together, it always feels like one of us was doing well whilst the other was on the go slow. The stars have seemed to align and after some focused rehab and maybe just a little good luck we’re both on the mend and running well.\n\nHowever, as we both worked through some walk-running and rehab earlier this year the we both pounded the pavements alone here in central Tamaki Makaurau we never really thought much of it but it has been at least a year since we’ve actually ran together.\n\nNow, we’re both love our running to get some alone time so honestly never really made the effort, but a few weeks back when visiting her parents down at Lake Okareka we decided to just head out on the trails together. Nothing special, well any trail run is special, but a 15km loop through the Whakarewarewa forest but instead of going out different ways, we just ran together.\n\nIt was wonderful, perfect winter temperatures, the trails were dry and the kilometres and elevation just ticked by. A few spots for your #boyfriendsofinstagram to get some pics but it was just lovely to get out and enjoy the trails together.\n\nAfter our little 90 minute jaunt through the forest, feeling equal parts tired and refreshed we partook in out favourite post exercise treat of some hot chips to warm up again and got on with our day.\n\nSome times it’s not the fast runs, not the long ones or even the new terrain, it’s just the company that makes it your greatest run ever.\n\nNovember 16, 2022\n\nTony Sharpe\n\nIn the purest sense my greatest run ever was that time on the Routeburn Rage early 2000’s (pre- Routeburn Classic) when it snowed like mad the whole way. It was surreal and incredible. Would never happen today with Health and Safety and all that jazz. What a riot.\n\nBut that’s not my submission. For this I am nominating the first time anyone ran the Christchurch 360 Trail in one sitting (so far as we know!). The 360 Trail is basically a giant 135km loop around Otautahi Christchurch, an urban “Great Walk” championed by local botanist and general legend Colin Meurk. His idea was a staged multiday hiking trail loop around the city, with a different flavour each day. And as at 2016 so far as I knew no one had run it in a day.\n\nEarlier the same year I had attempted my first 100 Miler at Naseby, having successfully bagged the 100km there the year before. The Naseby Miler attempt ended 70km deep in a whimpering mess of chest infection and coughing up blood at midnight in the depths of winter. It ate away at me, wondering if 100km was my limit and whether a Miler was even possible. So whilst training in the Port Hills for other things, I kept passing all the 360 Trail signage and the curiosity grew. Research was done and an idea was hatched. Having been a Red Shirt Support Runner in Mal Law’s High 50 I also wanted to do something for charity. And Mal and James Harcombe were well underway preparing for the Chasing The Dragon challenge around Wales. What better motivation?\n\nAs Mal always says if you want to own a personal challenge, then go public with it and make yourself accountable. Which is what I did. Almost instantly my trail buddy and all round legend George McNeur (Mr Wild Warrior of the Krayzie Kapers team) reached out and said he’d been on the committee for the 360 Trail and was keen to join in. So the idea was hatched. Mal and James jumped on board to support George and I. The media outlets came on board. We were away.\n\nOn Saturday December 11th 2016 we hit the trail at 4am in Halswell Quarry during a balmy and breezy 22 degree pre dawn. The plan was to do the flatlander stuff first. All the urban and fringe of town stuff, all the flat stuff, all the lesser known sections. About 90km of them. Then we could finish with the crowning glory, 40 odd km of hills from Sumner to Godley Head and then along the mighty Crater Rim Track. The dark wouldn’t matter up there, with familiar trails and minimal roads and cars.\n\nSome 15 hours after starting we hit Sumner , having run around ¾’s of Christchurch. Through the urban bits, along the braided rivers, through the forests and around the coastal margins and wetlands. It was warm, it was windy, it rained briefly in the forest before it soared well beyond the 30 degree’s as only Canterbury can in a norwester. It was thirsty and physically draining mahi but we were massively supported by Georges partner Stephanie, and our friends and family. And many many keen local support runners that were ably led by Mal and James, who had turns doing the sections of the whole mission with us. The amazing Corrine who flanked us on her bike for much of the day. George nearly flaked out by Sumner with something akin to heatstroke, but a cold shower and iceblock at the Sumner Lifesaving Club literally recharged him.\n\nEvening followed and it cooled off. Out over the rugged cliffs of Scarborough and Godley Head we went to hook onto the fabled Crater Rim Track. Then the southerly buster hit. The next several hours were the literal opposite of the day. Gales, thunder, overhead lightning, cold torrential rain for several hours before and after midnight. What a ride. At 3:16am we finished the “loop”, having completed a soggy descent down Kennedy’s Bush and back into Halswell Quarry. It was done, mission accomplished. 23 hours and 16 minutes. Personal bars raised, and a First Known Time. Several others have come since, faster and more talented than I- Brion Matthews, Corey Woodward, Tim Wright to name three, and some others even twice (looking at you Michael Stuart and Christopher Fairbarn). It’s become a thing, the “Christchurch Round” if you like.\n\nWhat started as a personal mission into the unknown became a much more important and wonderful fundraising event for the Mental Health Foundation. We raised a few grand for Mal and James’ mission, and had a wonderful adventure. The day itself, with all that the elements threw at us was so much more than we expected. The challenge within was quite a metaphor for mental wellbeing and all its ups and downs, light and dark, happy and low, it had it all. And incredible supporters. Too many to name.\n\nFor all those reasons, well and truly my greatest run ever.\n\nAnd yes, I got that 100 miler in the bag at the Hanmer Old Forest 100 the following year, and have been back for 2 more since. And 3 other Miler DNF’s elsewhere- but ain’t that the nature of the beast!\n\nNovember 9, 2022\n\nKelly Lilley\n\nI got into running about 2.5 years ago, as a Mum of 4 (now aged 4, 6, 8 and 10) it was my way of doing something for myself again, half hour runs made a big difference to regaining my fitness and doing something for me. I gave my first running event a go tackling the buller half last year and surprised myself with a reasonable time. My running buddy who is more seasoned then me coerced me into the mid distance South Island Ultra a few months later. Again knocking that off in a reasonable fashion I decided it was time for a big goal and set my sights on the 100 km the following year. I committed, I sacrificed, I juggled work/kids/training, I got up early and I ran for 8 months leading up to May. In between, other events were cancelled due to covid side lining everyone me included – but for those events that didn’t “run” we all missed out – we all sat on the bench. The timing for the Wilderness Trail run looked to be perfect, traffic lights, alert levels, protection frameworks or whatever they were referred to at the time eased. There was no doubt, this race was happening and I was ready. My stats in training peaks were climbing, my taper was on point, I had a coffee with my coach 4 days out, we talked race day. Then my husband text me . . . he had covid. My running mate, had radio silence for a couple of days, until my rat showed the dreaded 2 lines, not that it mattered I was isolating anyway so I wouldn’t be making the start line. Race day poured with rain, my friend nailed her 100 km, I sat inside when I wanted to be out there too.\n\nRest, take it easy, don’t get back into training too quick, you’ll get long covid . . . that was the next few weeks. The plan was to run the 100 then take a break, it seemed unfair to waste all the build up and not properly stretch the legs. Then I came across Krayzie Kapers . . . and Backyard Ultra’s, because what else do you do when you are moping then watch You Tube videos of people running and google events. I thought just maybe I can have a last hurrah and give a backyard a go . . . luckily my mate thought it was a cracker idea too.\n\nSo on Friday night I pull up to Spencer Park on a crisp winters evening to be welcomed by a hug from George and a tour of the event village. I had just unwittingly joined one crazy community. My mug shot taken, fresh faced and full of hopes and wonder. I met another Coaster and caught up with a colleague and friend from 12 years ago. Feeling somewhat like an imposter I set up my seen better days gazebo and threw about a bit of gear. What a rookie.\n\nMorning dawned, crisp and frosty. Back and forth to the car hauling clothes, chairs, sleeping bags, food. My running mate and I were crewing ourselves, intrigued to give this race format a go – husbands minding children and shaking their head ever so slightly. Rugged up with headlights on we answered the summons from the muster whistle. We joined 116 other crazy souls ready to embark on a race which might not have a winner, what fun! Into the forest we ran, headlights snaking out behind us, dancing in the pre-dawn darkness, onto the dunes to see the sunrise over the ocean, across a frosty boardwalk and back round to the finish line. Off to our gazebo to await the whistle and avoid the melting frost droplets, then repeat.\n\nWe all run for different reasons. Some of us run away from our demons, some of us towards them, others don’t like their toenails, some just really like chocolate. This backyard community was something else, a group who had come together to run for their own reason in the same way, on the whistle, round the loop, rest and repeat. To go further, to keep pushing, to test that boundary. You aren’t competing in the usual sense, you don’t need to be first home, you just need to get home, every lap gets to be your own personal race. It is busy, the day passes in hour blocks, all of a sudden 10 minutes feels like bliss before the whistle calls you back to the corral from your sunbathed chair. Round you go again as you get more familiar with the route. Slowly less people answer those calls, the chants of one more lap grow . . . The crowd swells in the sunshine, the supporters and spectators treat the runners to an almighty welcome each time they hit the finishing chute before disappearing from sight until the next whistle. Scouts on a camp out line the track in one part, ready for high fives – from the rock star you could pretend to be on this day.\n\nDarkness arrives, and I find myself alone, my mate has retired and I head off into the forest with that dancing snake of headlamps behind me. It looks different now – it is eerie. As darkness fell so did the jovial chatter. Here is the moment I am relieved I never saw more than the Blair Witch trailer, I can see the frost falling in front of the beam from my lamp, I can hear my breathe and the muffled footfall of all the remaining souls still out searching. One – more - lap. Over the dunes past the ocean, back to find the boardwalk frosty once more, searching for the lights of “home”.\n\nThe camaraderie 2nd to none. On the 13th lap, a sole headlight bobbed round the corner with a meagre 1 minute to go. The remaining runners ready in corral for the 14th, the crowd went wild, with 15 seconds on the clock I screamed sprint, this guy leant forwarded and morphed into road runner leaping across the line with a second to spare only to turn on his heel to be sucked back out. One more lap and rapturous applause – sssshhh mind the permanent residents – they mightn’t have cared as much as we did that that 6.667 km lap counted for road runner.\n\n12 laps, I completed. 80.5 km. I ran strong, I ran consistent, I had power at the end of every lap. I had wanted to knock off the 100, but it dawned on me that I didn’t need to. This wasn’t that race and I now knew I could run that distance. Out on those laps I realised a backyard ultra can be whatever you need it to be. We all got to run our own race that day be it 1, 12, 35 laps or anywhere in between. For me rounding out the 12 hours was my day, I wasn’t broken, I felt fit, I felt happy. It was my greatest run ever, it was a DNF and I wanted to go home and hug my wee people!\n\nOctober 26, 2022\n\nIan Gilmour\n\nGreatest run ever (well, a great run at least).\n\nI have had lots of great runs, but have held off sending in a 'greatest run ever' because I don't want to nail this down to a single run. However with the swag on offer and a recent amazing run fresh in my mind, it's time to submit.\n\nI don't know how I got in touch with Mike McManaway, but somehow we started chatting about running the Dragons Teeth High Route together - or rather Mike guiding me through the 60km route from the Cobb Reservoir through to Bainham. I had always thought of the Dragons Teeth as an extreme tramping route with huge exposure, weather dependancy and route finding challenges. Going with someone who knew the area like the back of their hand would allay the route finding issues, and doing it in a single day would help mitigate the weather dependancy and exposure by not having 10kg hanging off your back.\n\nAfter some false starts due to weather and schedule clashes, Mike and I finally met in Upper Takaka for the first time in early April, and drove up the Cobb to our starting point. We wanted to maximise our chances of getting through the un-tracked tops section in light, so we started at 4am and had the sunrise just as we reached Waingaro Peak.\n\nSpending a day on the tops in bluebird weather is always a recipe for a great run. This had some extras with the spiciness of the slabby rock and exposure, the indistinctly marked path, the high-country lakes and tarns and the uniqueness of the Anatoki-lands and Dragon-lands that were the absolute highlight of the trip. But more than this was the company and chat that Mike provided along the whole run. Thanks mate - was a cracker.\n\nOctober 19, 2022\n\nMark Buckland\n\nMy wife and I drove our caravan up to Paihia for the Bay Of Islands Running Festival earlier this year. I’m very much a Mild Thing and slow to boot, and was looking forward to the Half marathon of this event. I had to get up early to collect my number, but was shocked when I woke at 7:00 - 30 minutes before the start. I scrambled to get all my gear and jumped in the car. My wife dropped me off and I scuttled to the tent, just getting my number attached in time.\n\nIt was a cold and rainy day as we headed north towards Waitangi. The course followed the Haruru Falls track beside the estuary before hading up into the hills and down through the Waitangi Mountain Bike Park. I was not setting a blistering pace (I never do), and there were a lot of things that should make this a horrible run - the cold and rain, a “slip-n-slide” on a boardwalk, and the occasional ankle-deep mud.\n\nHowever, as I headed through the Waitangi Treaty Grounds on my own at the 17km mark, I experienced the runner’s high that I had often heard about but never had myself. I could have run home to Whangarei at that stage. It won’t last long, I told myself. But then it got better when my daughter turned up on her bike and stayed with me all the way to the finish line. Having her spur me on was really awesome and something I’ll remember for many years to come.\n\nHopefully I can get her on the trails when she gets older. I’m sure that would make for an even greater greatest run ever.\n\nOctober 12, 2022\n\nSkip the Border Collie\n\nOMG they’re all putting their shoes on!! Am I going too?\n\n“Do you want to go for a run with us or a bike ride with dad?” asks my mum.\n\n“I’ll take her”, says Aunty Elly.\n\n“Ok, but you’re responsible for her”, says mum. YUS!! I decide to be on my best behaviour - I’d better not disappear off and bail possums up trees today.\n\nI drag Aunty Elly down the hill in front of mum and Katie, and pretty soon she lets me off the lead. Freedom!! I zoom around on the big grassy area near Squirrel Lake. I have no idea where we’re going, but I don’t care - I’m going. I head off down a track that looks interesting, but we are going a different way. I come when Aunty Elly calls coz she has treats in her pocket. Yum!\n\nWe go up a hill, down the other side, then up some bike tracks. Some bikes come past. Maybe I should go with them? It could be my dad, coz we go biking together sometimes. But mum is calling me. I run to Aunty Elly. She gives me a treat. Score!\n\nThen we start going up steeper. There are rocks to jump up. The wind gets blowy, but I’m nice and warm with my fur. Why do my humans keep stopping? Ooh, I smell something, I want to run and investigate, but remember I’m meant to be on my best behaviour. Soon my feet start getting cold. There’s white stuff and then it gets super slippery. My legs are going in all directions. I can’t get a grip! “It’s icy!” calls out Katie. I follow her through the bushes up the side of the frozen stream.\n\nAnother dog barks in front of me. I’m curious and a bit shy, but it sounds friendly. We catch up to it coz mum and Aunty Elly and Katie are going fast. I sniff and play a little bit, but I need to keep up with my humans. Soon we’re up at the top. The wind is blowing much harder and there’s a lot more soft white stuff. It tastes so good! My new friend turns up and we run around and around together bouncing and eating snow. This is so much fun!!\n\nWe are off again, my mum calls me coz she’s getting cold. Aunty Elly and Katie head off a different way. I trot home down the hill with my mum. We go a different way with a stream, I like swimming but it’s a bit cold today. I’m still on my best behaviour all the way back, because I want to be allowed out again. I can save chasing possums for another day. Today was definitely my greatest run ever.\n\nOctober 5, 2022\n\nMichele\n\nAbout 6.5 months ago I was invited to join a friend on a fun run. I had mainly been a road runner,happily getting in a 1/2 marathon a year for the past 5 years or so. To me all runs were considered fun, but this run had instructions. Come in a costume and bring drinks (alcoholic ones, that is). I love dress up parties and that was enough for me to want to go, but I had NEVER combined it with a run.\n\nIt was a self-supported 50k and RTD’s of your choice were clearly a great way to rehydrate at every other of the 9 volcanoes we summited that day around Auckland in the beautiful summer heat! I recall feeling overly nervous. I’d never been on group run like that before (there were over 12 people and I only knew one).\n\nI seriously doubted my ability, wondering if my “pace” would hold the other real runners up. I didn’t yet have a running watch with a map or anything. Would people be patient if I needed them to wait or if I asked where we were going as I had never been where we were going to run. I was very keen but clueless. How would I know who to run with, what if I picked the wrong person - what if they were too fast and I couldn’t keep up with them, what if they didn’t like my enthusiastic American chatter and uncontrollable squeals of delight? My brain worried like the blades of a ceiling fan spinning round and round.\n\nThe day totally surprised me and completely changed my life. The entire group couldn’t have been nicer. From the second I arrived, people offered to apply sunblock, store stuff in their car while we ran, and shared their food and drinks during the run and after. It was like an American Tailgate party at a football stadium filled with humour, team spirit, generosity and pure genuineness . They took me in as if they actually knew me. It was unlike runs I’d done before - here everyone chatted, joked and laughed. WHILE RUNNING 50k!\n\nThere was absolutely no stress, no pressure, no tension to compete - just 100% fun. The sense of community that I instantly felt was so wholesome and so fulfilling. The rest of my body wasn’t sore afterwards but my cheeks actually hurt from smiling. These people I happened to just meet by chance are now my friends who inspire me. We run together. We support each other. I have been baptized into the trail running world. There is so much fun to be had, places to explore and I look forward to enjoying it with friends. Trail running is this perfect trifecta of fitness, friends and nature. My eyes have now been opened, my mind is now alive with possibilities. I am beyond grateful. All of these reasons are what makes this “My Greatest Run Ever”.\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nAnonymous\n\nMy greatest run ever was far from spectacular or exciting. It was a routine morning run in the dark before work, on a very cold winter morning. I had just had a week off running due to multiple niggles, which doesn’t sound significant, but was a huge deal for me. I have to take you back two years to explain.\n\nTwo years ago, life hit rock bottom for me. A nagging pain in my glute ended up being a severe sacral stress fracture. It was the culmination of 15 years of an eating disorder, and felt like the end of the world. For over a decade I had pushed my body beyond its limits and I had been able to do amazing things - 10 road marathons, countless trail runs, multiple trail ultras, two treks in Nepal. This was alongside doing medical school and becoming a surgical trainee. So although I knew I had all the signs of underfueling (REDS), I kept going. Despite the best efforts of my family and friends and numerous professionals to help me, nothing was truly going to stop me and make me change. Until I got a fracture that I actually couldn’t ignore. It was terrible. There were many tears of sadness and anger, mostly at myself. I felt completely lost, with no identity. I had two months of complete rest, not even gentle yoga was allowed. I ate what I was told. Then I started swimming for limited time with a kick board. That was in the midst of COVID, so I was swimming in the cold Melbourne ocean in mid winter. Then after 5 months I started a very slow return to running. It started as 30 second jogs; it was slow but it was amazing to be able to run again, especially to feel reconnected to the friends I did it with. Since then, I have done another two marathons and many trails, all with a bit more food and rest. It isn’t all rosy though, as the voice telling me to run more and eat less is still there. It is just quieter now and more controllable. But then last week I got sore feet and back. My immediate thought to any pain is that I have another stress fracture. So I did something that three years ago would have been impossible. I took a week off running. Not because I physically couldn’t run, but because my body didn’t feel right and I knew a week off now is better than weeks or months off if I pushed through. The day I had scheduled a long run came and went, with me constantly shutting up the stupid voice in my head. My biggest strength in these moments is to think what my sister and few close friends would do, all people who have healthy relationships with food and endurance sport. They know who they are. A new found love may also help. A few days in, the niggles felt better. But I stuck to my plan and didn’t run for a week. So this cold morning run back was the first back. Fortunately the niggles were gone and I felt refreshed. I felt so proud that I had been able to take a break, and felt it was a big step in my eating disorder recovery. I don’t think I will ever be recovered but that little voice is getting weaker. I will always want to push further. But I know I have to be smart. Never ever do I want to lose my ability to run again, as not being able to share the road and trails with friends is something I just can’t lose again.\n\nSeptember 21, 2022\n\nJohanna Lucia\n\nMy most grateful greatest run ever!!\n\n2018, June, Town of Seaside Park Run, with my Pops!!\n\nI have so many great runs. From my home town Maunga, Taranaki. To the foothills of the Himalayas. The highlands of Scotland to the low lands of Europe but none of those can compare to my local park run with my Dad!\n\nBack when I was 22 I thought I should train for a Marathon to do at least one with my Dad before he retired. (92 half’s, 65 fulls and 4 ultras!) Knowing full well the only part of ‘with him’ would be at the start line! He’d be showered and fed, well before I finished! So I trained for the 35th Rotorua Marathon, standing on the start line in pouring rain, wearing our black sack rubbish bags to stay dry to be told it was cancelled!\n\nAs a young fit 20 something my Dad and his running buddies from Manawatu Marathon clinic would always kick my butt when I was home for a weekend and run with them. These old blokes would take great pleasure in beating me on the climbs in their 50’s and 60’s\n\nI ran Barcleys Rotorua Marathon “with” my dad the following year in a grand time of 4.25hrs and Dad 3.49! (PB of 2.58!!!)\n\nThen I grew up, moved overseas, moved back, had children, moved towns, moved to Aus, backpacked and moved back to Australia. During that time Dad had a few health issues, my strong fit father! I never remember him ever being ill growing up. He was always running or mtbing or something crazy on the mountains with or without skis! Did I mention his Black Belt in Karate competing in Japan?? My Mum is pretty frigg’n amazing raising 4 cool kids\n\nHis running took a hit! He slowed right down and just walking the dog round the block was strenuous enough (when he could manage that!) Slowly he began to rebuild. He knew how good running was for his mental and physical health. He knew moving forward was the only way forward. He discovered Park Runs in Palmy so I was super excited to run with him on my local when he came on holiday. It was slow but it was amazing! I felt such an honour and a privilege to have a mentor like my Pops! Strength, resilience, can-do Kiwi attitude! To have grown up on his sidelines, handing out flat coke and Moro bars from 30km to be running beside him was a beautiful thing! THE best finish line feels EVER!!! Making sure he stops his Casio stop watch right on the finish line!!\n\nNow they can travel again, I’m stoked for them to support me at Rainbow Beach marathon next month while I set my goals to Blackall 100 in October (my 10th ultra…not my fathers daughter ) - sorry it’s not so much about the run, not much to cover over 5kms. More about the journey, the love and the support!\n\nSeptember 14, 2022\n\nTom Igusa\n\nMy greatest run ever is definitely the “Great Kauri Run” in November 2014. It was my first Ultra and the toughest by far.\n\nMy friend, Callum Wicks, who I used to do mountaineering with, started Ultramarathon a few years earlier and suggested that Ultra would be my thing. But I am not a keen runner (still today) and only ran as training for other sports. So, I passed on his suggestion for ages until I watched a TV programme made by then-TV3 Producer, Eugene Bingham about his own attempt to run his first Tarawera 100k. It changed my mind and the new goal of running Tarawera 100k was set.\n\nAs soon as the programme finished, I started to work on what I need to run Tarawera 100k in February 2015. As a final prep for it, I decided to run 72k Great Kauri Run in November 2014.\n\nWith very little knowledge, I turned up to the race registration in Coromandel township. Kerry Suter who is a record holder and won the races pretty much every year was helping to register runners. He quickly sniffed my “newbie-ness” and asked several questions to size me up. I barely passed those questions, but he wished me good luck at the end.\n\nI had two goals for this run. One was to finish so I could use it as a stepping stone for Tarawera and if possible, I wanted to finish in the top 50%, not the bottom 50%.\n\nI was so nervous and could not sleep well at all on the night before the race but turned up to the start line with 30 odd runners. The race started well for me and I was leading the race for the first 400m. Obviously I had no idea about how to pace a race. Anyway, everything was going well until the halfway point, Waikawau Beach. I met and had good chats with people like Shane Caske, who I am still connected with.\n\nAs I left the beach, I started to feel the discomfort in my left knee. The pain got worse as I progressed and I could not run without poles. During the run, I had no idea I developed ITB friction syndrome. It was really sore and I was popping down painkillers. Back then no one was talking about the risk of kidney injury from taking pain killers. Anyway, they had zero impact on my knee pain.\n\nI skipped and walked for ages and eventually found “21km to go” signage and my heart sank to the bottom. I could not possibly imagine how I could travel another half marathon distance like this. The second half of the race was considerably harder than the first half. The track was either up or down and there was very little flat ground. For those who do not know, ITB causes pain when you go down slowly and so my knee suffered great pain for a loooong time.\n\nGood thing about this being my first Ultra was that I had no concept of DNF or had expectations of Ultra. For about 2 years, I thought going through extreme pain like this was normal as I could not solve the issue for 2 years.\n\nWith a few km to go, the course takes you down the last hill. I still remember how painful it was and was glad I had poles with me. Once I got down to the urban road, I hurried along to the finish line. The last km felt like 10 km to me. When I finally got to the finish line, staff was taking down the set up and people did not even realised I just finished 72k run. I had to walk up to one of the staff and ask if the event was finished or not. Basically, there were only a few of us left on the field and they decided to pack up while they wait for us. Then I was asked to tell the timekeeper that I finished. When I told the guy I just finished, he asked me the time I finished. As I was not sure if I finished or not, I did not stop my watch and the watch was displaying 10hr 59mins. He said “I saw you come in a while ago. So I give you 10hr58. So I became 7th finisher with the time of 10hr 58 mins.\n\nI was happy with 7th position finish among 30 odd participants. But later I found that everyone else except for 8th finisher, Mark Beatie had DNFed and I was second from the last. However, 7th finish is still my best finishing position in my running career.\n\nI think 2014 Kauri is and will be my greatest run ever because it was so hard and so painful. It served my masochistic fetish very well. Also Kauri was such a down to earth, no frill event but full of supportive volunteers and a tough course!\n\nUnfortunately, the race lost one of the founders to a sudden death at end of last year but I hope they can put it on again.\n\nP.S.\n\nI managed the ITB and finished Tarawera 2015. Also I stalked the legend, Eugene Bingham long enough to make friends with him. The moral of the story? If you persevere, you always get what you desire!\n\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\nKayla McKenzie\n\nGreatest run ever for me so far would be the Kepler Challenge I ran last year! My first ever ultra. What makes Kepler great is the amazing views (was a blue bird day!), the varied terrain to keep you guessing and the inquisitive Kea were a massive highlight for me!. I fell over and scuffed my knees up (typical clumsy me!) so still have the scars to remember it by. Such a mind game. Would love to tick some more off the list.\n\nVal Spooner\n\nGreatest run ever for me is when my mood is low, and nothing seems to be going right but I drag myself out and say you must do at least 25mins before you can go home and then the run just keeps going and the endorphins are released and most of all I try to remember how good I felt for when this will happen next time!\n\nAshlee Dolamore\n\nI thought I'd send in my greatest run so far. I'm sure I'll have many better runs to come so I've been reluctant to send this one in but it's held a special place in my heart for a year or so.\n\nThere was nothing particularly interesting about this run. It was just a training circuit in my local park, which I'm out in several times a week.\n\nIt was a beautiful sunny day. I was flying, my feet hardly touching the ground, in an almost meditative state, with that elusive runner's high. It was one of those moments where I was completely in the present and everything felt like it was right with the world.\n\nShortly after that run, I had a knee injury and couldn't run for several months in the lead up to, and recovery from, surgery.\n\nDuring that time, I kept coming back to the memory of that run and the almost childlike joy I'd felt. It was a period of frustration for me, not knowing how serious the damage was until after surgery, but holding onto that awesome run got me through.\n\nNow, I'm out running again. I'm not fully up to speed yet but the prognosis is good and in looking forward to my next greatest run ever on the horizon.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nAlister Kennedy\n\nHere's my story of my greatest run ever.\n\nDuring the first 2020 lockdown I pretty badly let myself go. Weight jumped up past 110kg and I didn't really do any fitness work at all (I blame the banana bread).\n\nIn July I had my first child and knew that I wanted to be fit as she grows up so I can play with her as much as I can so I started running. 10ks a week was the first goal. Then 12, 15, 18, 20.\n\nIn my first week targeting 23ks I had done a 4km on the Monday and then had a shocker of a week at work so didn't achieve much in terms of running until the Saturday.\n\nAn early alarm was set with the plan to run a 10k (my longest run ever) and try run the difference the next day.\n\nI set out and was feeling quite good. 3ks in and I was 1/3 of the way there, 6ks and I was 2/3s in still feeling good. I got to 10k and texted my wife asking if our daughter was awake yet to no response so figured I'd run until she texted me.\n\nAfter 3 laps of the new subdivision near my house all of a sudden I'm at 16ks.\n\nI still felt good and the baby was still sleeping.\n\nI'd never run a half marathon before that day but managed to get home after 21ks feeling quite shattered but super stoked with how I'd gone.\n\nIt was a huge mental block for me to get past the 10k mark but I'm stoked I did it and was stoked to finish my first half. And all before the baby woke up.\n\nI'm now 30kg down and recently ran 30ks at the Summerhill Skedaddle.\n\nLove the podcast. Perfect thing for me to listen to while I commute!\n\nAugust 24, 2022\n\nJason White\n\nSitting at Lyell Saddle aid station, 67kms into my attempt at running the Old Ghost Ultra, I had never felt so sore, tired and straight up exhausted ever before. Pretty much everything hurt, and my fuel light had come on long ago.\n\nWind the clock back 24hrs and I had arrived to event check-in to experience a huge bout of imposter syndrome. Never before had I felt so out of place. Five years earlier I was packing down in scrums as a prop, with a playing weight usually around 115kg. When I stopped playing this ballooned out to almost 130kg, and I knew I needed to do something to get active again after my job had consumed me.\n\nSo to walk into the check in at 95kg was a great achievement, however, I still felt so far out of place around all of the other people who were doing a much better job of looking like a runner should than me. I was aware of how silly that perception was, but at Seddonville the next morning as we were awaiting the start of the event I still couldn’t shake the ‘what an earth am I doing here, I don’t belong’ and ‘holy shit what have I got myself into’ feeling.\n\nIf the event had a heavyweight division, there wouldn’t have been many of us in it! As the course wound its way up the stunning Mōkihinui Gorge I had time to contemplate how far I had come and practice gratitude for the journey I had travelled and the support of my family for allowing me to take the challenge on. I was able to reflect on running half-marathon distance for the first time when training for the Rotorua Marathon and thinking ‘how on earth am I going to do that twice?’, and after shattering my own perceptions of my capabilities and finishing that marathon, to then pondering if I could double that and run the Old Ghost Ultra.\n\nI was cruising along nicely up until the Specimen Point aide station but was a bit behind my target time as my imposter syndrome meant I started further back in the pack than I probably should have, and then had to find my way through traffic. After leaving that aid station I managed to find clear track and got into a good rhythm, making up time but probably expending more energy than I should have. When the climbing started it coincided with the first heat of the day and my pace dropped noticeably.\n\nMy rugby years were not kind on my body, and with metal in both of my ankles, and less cartilage in both of my knees than I was issued with, a good knee and ankle day is a good run day and they were generally playing ball which was great news. Dropping down into the Stern Valley aid station brought us back into the bush and out of the sun, and access to my drop bag goodies.\n\nIt was a strange thought to think I had ticked off a marathon and still had another to go, continuing to smash through my preconceived perceptions of my abilities.\n\nAfter this aid station you quickly find the hard work starting with the much lauded stair climb, and the following zig zag up to Ghost Lake. This journey was made much easier with the company of Dave from Timaru, a buddy met by chance that I will likely never meet again but I appreciated the chat while we ground our way up the hill in the scorching sun.\n\nIn the pre race briefing the organisers point out that at some point in the climb you’ll be able to see Ghost Lake hut, but don’t look up as it can be demoralising and unfortunately I made this error.\n\nSitting at the hut I was really starting to notice the intensity of the heat, and I began to become aware of how far behind on fluids I was. I remember at this point being shocked by how the live feed the event crew was beaming out really was live despite our remote location, as supportive messages from colleagues at the college I teach at came through.\n\nClimbing up on top of the ridge was simply stunning, the cloudless day had made the heat tough but wow were the views worth it, what a magical place and what a privilege to be able to see it on a blue sky day.\n\nAs I started the descent I finally managed to pee, first time in a long time and that confirmed for me how dry I was due to the deep shade of yellow. I worked on getting more water in as I dropped back into the shelter of the trees but by then my left knee had decided it had had enough, the downhill was not doing it any favours and it was really getting to me.\n\nBy the time I sat down at Lyell Saddle I wasn’t in good shape and was intimidated by the 18km still to go, that a few years ago I would have struggled to run fresh, and now I had to take it on in this state.\n\nThe aid station crew were simply amazing and their encouragement got me back on my feet and in a positive frame of mind, where I was able to break the remaining distance down into sections and tick the k’s off as I passed each marker.\n\nI surprised myself by managing to keep a reasonably consistent pace over that final stretch, but the sight of the final bridge still came as a very welcome sight. My wife, Mum, and three kids were there to cheer me over the line and the feeling of accomplishment and pride for what I had achieved is something that will stay with me forever. It wasn’t just the journey of that February day, but the journey I had been on for the couple of years prior, that made this my greatest run ever.\n\nAugust 17, 2022\n\nJosh\n\nThis is a shout out to those random runs where for no particular reason, everything just seems to go right. Those rare runs where your legs don't hurt, the pace feels easy, the wind in your hair becomes extra exhilarating and you feel like you could run all night. This run took place on an uneventful week night in the bustling metropolis of Timaru, where I happened to be living when I was 24.\n\nThe punishing backstory is I'd picked up a recreational running habit in my early teens after being introduced to the gateway book, Into the Wild. I joined the notorious New Plymouth Boys' High School cross country team where I grew from the camaraderie in my formative years – the team mantra of \"No Excuses\" will be forever branded in my psyche to push me in the gritty parts of any race. Moreover I just enjoyed the simple 'wind-in-the-hair' freedom of running and the nirvana of those rare runs that just go perfectly.\n\nI loved running, but unfortunately the Girvan running genes (as I'm sure my brother, Matt, would agree) were less like a comfy pair of Levi's and more like a tattered pair of jorts. While I grew through my high school years, my list of injuries grew faster. Between the ages of 18 and 26 I more or less abandoned running aside from the occasional attempted comeback which always hurt and never lasted. Instead I redirected my energy toward the sports of hiking, rock climbing, skiing and binge drinking. However, no matter how much I enjoyed these alternatives, the thought always remained in the back of mind – this illusive, seemingly delusional goal – to one day, somehow, run pain-free.\n\nSo this brings me to a random night in TimaVegas, during a period where pain-free running was just a pipe dream. But for some reason on this run I didn't have to stop 10 minutes in to stretch out my calf muscles, I didn't get the familiar tension in my mid spine that would normally restrict my breathing to 80%, my IT band and glute didn't try to cramp up on me. I ran my shorter loop up the river trail and golden hour happened to be extra pretty that night. The air felt fresher, the grass looked greener, the crunch of gravel under my feet sounded more delicious - all as though the serenity in my legs freed me to be more sensitive to the world around me. I realised that without trying I'd completed the short loop in my fastest time yet, and still I felt like a hundred bucks, so I continued on to run my longer loop as well. I turned off the river and charged along the coastal cliff trail in pure ecstacy. I ran like a transcended being. I went yahooing like a zealot into the blustery wind while the sun set over the Pacific. My legs and lungs burned but it felt so good. I was alive. I got back to my flat to chug some water, have a snack and grab my head torch while my flatmates wondered what the hell I was up to. I went out and ran my short loop again to round off what was at the time my longest run ever.\n\nEvery runner knows these miracle runs are rare, and often unpredictable, but are what make life worth the livin'. This one was enough for me to feed off for a few years until I grew out of some injuries and learned how to train smarter. These days running is once again the backbone of my life that keeps my mental wellbeing steady and my endorphins supplied.\n\nMy greatest run ever (so far).\n\nAugust 10, 2022\n\nNathan May\n\nI heard the call, and thought it was time I submitted another Greatest Run Ever!!\n\nI went for a run recently. A local 8k loop that features a bit of everything, some road, some stairs, a glimpse of the beach, a few hills and a small section of trail.\n\nThere’s nothing particularly special about this loop, I’ve run it many times before. But on this particular day this loop was different. On this day the loop was filled with possibility, with anticipation, with excitement! And the reason? The reason was because this was “New Shoe Day”!!.\n\nYou see, I’ve had this new pair of trail shoes sitting in the back of my wardrobe still in their box since September. I don’t know why I chose to christen these shoes on this particular day. But it just felt like it was time. I laced them up and headed out the door. But it wasn’t the shoes that made this run great. It was the thoughts that filled my mind as I trotted out this rather familiar route.\n\nAs I ran I started looking forward to all the adventures we’ll have together!!\n\nThe places these shoes will take me\n\nThe things we’ll see\n\nThe gravel we will crunch\n\nThe hills we will climb\n\nThe races we will run\n\nThe people we will meet\n\nThe challenges we will face and the possibilities that they will bring!!\n\nSo here’s to new shoe day!!\n\nAugust 3, 2022\n\nSteve Ackerman\n\nMy Greatest Run Ever started at daybreak at Dason Falls carpark on Mt Taranaki. The aim was to do a solo loop of the AMC (Around the Mountain Circuit) track. It's usually done as 3 day hike, staying in the lovely DOC huts. However, my plan was to do this 43km jaunt in under 12 hours.\n\nIt started off poorly, as I chose the Lower Lake Dive Track. I slipped on the frosty rocks crossing a small stream in the first hour, and stepped in the icy water, as it was nearing Easter when I did this run. With my sloshy foot, I kept trudging past the first of many huts that I would pass. The trail became more overgrown and not so runnable as I headed down the Auroa Track down to Brahms Falls. From river level, the track then ascends a 100m ladder. In reality it's probably only 30-40 m, but it looks 100m high. Fortunately it had a cage around it so I felt marginally safer. Passing Kahui Hut for a breakfast of a gel, I startled some early morning trampers just getting up. Then it was the jungly section to Kahui Hut. I misjudged a tree root when hopping a gap and landed hard on my ankle. It was a pretty serious sprain and throbbing. Fortunately I had packed an ankle aircast with me and slapped that on right away. It was still a bit sore, but I managed to keep going, seeing as I was only 10 km into this marathon run.\n\nDropping down to the Stony River was a pleasant descent, then the scenery turned lunar landscape. A flood a few years back had cut its way along the river and turned the track into a rocky hop fest. Eventually, the proper track starts up again, as it heads up and up to Holly Hut. It was about 3pm by the time I stumbled up to Holly Hut and was greeted by a few trampers. I must have looked rough, as the offered me their food and energy bars. I happily accepted and told them I was headed another 13k to Dawson Falls. They gave each other dark looks, as if I was a bit daft to be heading that far with just 2 1/2 to 3 hours of daylight left. That was the same distance they planned to do for the whole next day. I was now racing the dark. I made it as far as the Manganui Ski field before darkness fell. I had a small hand held torch, as I was sure I would have been done by now. It was slow progress on a skinny, winding track. Fortunately, it was the night of the Blood Moon that rose like a large orange ball on the horizon. It lit the way better than my little torch and raised my sagging spirit. The last few kms went well, as I hobbled down from Wilkies Pools to the carpark.\n\nMission accomplished. Total time: 12:10\n\nAs I called home to report my great success, I was scolded by my dear wife who said \"what took you so bloody long? We were about ready to get a search party sent up the mountain to find you\". Next time, I'll take her with me.\n\nJuly 27, 2022\n\nKate Southern\n\nI've already had the privilege of sharing my greatest run ever with you a year or so ago, but I'm writing in to update that with my new greatest run ever.\n\nIf you’d asked me even a year ago if I wanted to do the Tongariro Alpine crossing I would have foun"
