        "text": "Grading the Franchise is a recurring feature at Cinecaps Digest where I review an entire film series. Today, it’s the post-apocalyptic action Mad Max series.\n\nAfter two days of dark future visions in the form of dystopian and post-apocalyptic films, here comes Mad Max, the cinematic icon of the ruined afterworld. A key entry in the so-called Australian New Wave and Ozploitation movements, the first low-budget Mad Max picture was like deranged drive-in fodder from a true visionary (director George Miller). A lot of people forget (or never knew) that the original movie wasn’t set in a scorched wasteland with convoys of “Frankensteined” vehicles savagely attacking the taciturn antihero known as Max Rockatansky; it’s actually set in the near future where society is deteriorating, gang violence has taken over the streets, and the high-speed destructo-derbies are limited to a handful of nerve-shredding encounters between lunatics of different stripes. It was the second film in the franchise, Mad Max 2 (or, to Americans, The Road Warrior) that birthed the template of nearly every post-apocalyptic actioner to come—dust, leather, diesel, blood, barbarians, and high-speed collisions.\n\nAfter capping off one of cinema’s most entertaining (and consistently good) movie trilogies, Max went into extended slumber. Its star, Mel Gibson, became a global powerhouse (and, eventually, a demonized rageoholic), and its director turned away from violent action pictures in favor of talking pigs, dancing penguins, and race-for-the-cure weepies. But then, after many years spent in development hell, the long-gestating Mad Max Fury Road finally went into production, confused the heck out of its stars who didn’t understand what he was trying to do, and went on to become the movie that everyone talked about in 2015. A Best Picture Oscar nomination for a post-apocalyptic action movie sequel? Surely, you jest. But, nope, it happened, and let’s face it, it deserved to win—Spotlight was a fine film, but did Spotlight set a new standard for an entire film genre?\n\nThough I’ve seen no shortage of truly excellent films in the theater during my lifetime (Schindler’s List, L.A. Confidential, There Will Be Blood, The Social Network, I could go on and on), there have been two filmgoing experiences that stand above all others for the pure cinematic pleasure they provided me: Jurassic Park when I was about twelve years old and gob-smacked by the abso-frickin’-lutely real dinosaurs on screen, and Mad Max: Fury Road when I was a grown-ass adult reduced to childlike wonder and hyperactive exhilaration. I had high hopes for both, and those hopes were exceeded and then some.\n\nWith Fury Road, I was sitting in one of those comfy reclining multiplex chairs, and I was pasted to the back of that thing the entire time, just blown away by the creativity, the energy, the gorgeous golds of the landscape, the bright blues of the hollow sky, the royal red-oranges of the fireballs, the pearly white of the War Boys leaping into action. I didn’t think it was possible that Mad Max 2 would ever be topped in the series, especially with a new actor playing Max and the sad truth that long-awaited series continuations rarely live up to the episodes that preceded it. I was thrilled to be proven so wrong on that assumption.\n\nUpdate: Fury Road prequel, Furiosa, has been added below.\n\nMad Max (1979)\n\nDirected by George Miller. Starring Mel Gibson, Roger Ward, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Joanne Samuel, Steve Bisley, Tim Burns, Geoff Parry, John Ley, Steve Millichamp, Jonathan Hardy, Sheila Florence, Vincent Gil. [R]\n\nIt’s the Bronze vs. the Scoot Jockeys in a crumbling society on the verge of collapse. Unbalanced highway patrol cop Max Rockatansky (Gibson), driven to the brink of madness from his battles with nomad biker gangs, gives it all up and takes his wife and child out of town, but when a demented crew out for retribution targets Max’s family, he realizes he hasn’t hung up the leather for good yet. Ferociously raw, exhilarating Ozploitation flick put Gibson and first-time director Miller on the international map by making a low-budget car-and-carnage thriller that really cooks. Simplistic plotting founded on Western conventions, but populated by freaky eccentrics, an almost profound sense of gonzo sickness and decay, and (of course) kinetic speed and destruction as captured by the wild stunts and creative camerawork. At one time, the most profitable independent feature ever made. Keays-Byrne, who plays the unhinged biker gang leader, would go on to play the chief antagonist, Immortan Joe, in Mad Max: Fury Road. Followed by several sequels.\n\n88/100\n\nMad Max 2 (1981)\n\nDirected by George Miller. Starring Mel Gibson, Bruce Spence, Vernon Wells, Mike Preston, Kjell Nilsson, Max Phipps, Emil Minty, Virginia Hey, Steven J. Spears, Arkie Whiteley, William Zappa. [R]\n\nThe fallout of a global war has depleted oil reserves and reduced humanity to anarchy and barbarism. Through the wasteland wanders ex-cop loner Max (Gibson), who comes upon a settlement defending their fuel supplies from a pack of savage, leather-clad marauders, and reluctantly decides to help them, while perhaps rediscovering some glimmer of his lost humanity in the process. Thunderous, high-octane exhilaration, barreling along at a frenzied pace that reduces character to the skeletal essentials and the plot to a patchwork of Western motifs and burnt-rubber set pieces. Its heart-pounding car crashes and stuntwork still rate among the most dazzlingly ferocious that have ever been put on screen, and its blasted landscapes, scrapyard speedsters, and hellbent S&M fetishized outfits proved such trend-setters that nearly every post-apocalyptic action pic since has been a blatant imitator to at least some degree. Its twenty-plus minute climactic chase—Max and a tanker truck pummeling through a gauntlet of crazies on an endless stretch of decaying highway—is a breathtaking, rarely-rivaled tour de force of action cinema. Given the title The Road Warrior for its American release (because the US was the only major market in which the first Mad Max wasn’t a big hit).\n\n94/100\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nDirected by George Miller & George Ogilvie. Starring Mel Gibson, Tina Turner, Angelo Rossitto, Helen Buday, Frank Thring, Robert Grubb, Bruce Spence, Adam Cockburn, Tom Jennings, Angry Anderson, Paul Larsson. [PG-13]\n\nMany years after the blistering fury of Mad Max 2, Gibson’s resourceful drifter ends up in a settlement called Bartertown, run by the imperious Aunty Entity (Turner) and her feuding rival, Master Blaster—a brainy dwarf (Rossitto) riding the shoulders of a hulking strongman (Larsson). Gibson makes a deal with Turner to fight Master Blaster in a caged death match known as Thunderdome, but as hinted at by the title, that’s just the beginning. A slicker, more extravagant production than its two predecessors, with a generally looser, more tongue-in-cheek tone; not as aggressively electric as the previous films in the series, but supporting character definition and juicy dialogue are on the upswing. Cleanly divided into three acts; the first (set in Bartertown and detailing the inner workings, the struggle for power, and the Thunderdome battle) and the last (a series of spectacular fights and chases) are enthralling, top-tier material, but the middle sags during an extended visit with a Lost Boys-esque tribe of youths—it’s an initially welcome and unexpected break from the rugged, rip-roaring madness these pictures are known for, but sacrificing momentum for the sake of added depth feels like a mistake. Turner sidesteps accusations of stunt casting with a legitimately diverting performance; she also sings a couple songs on the soundtrack, including “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome).” Dedicated to Miller’s producing partner, Byron Kennedy, who died in a helicopter crash in the interim between Mad Max 2 and this outing.\n\n86/100\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nDirected by George Miller. Starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton, Josh Helman, Nathan Jones, Melissa Jaffer, Megan Gale, John Howard, Richard Carter, Angus Samson. [R]\n\nFourth Mad Max film took more than a decade to finally reach the big screen, but it was more than worth the wait. After getting captured by a cult army of War Boys led by the monstrous, masked Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne), Max Rockatansky (Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson) joins forces with fierce warrior Furiosa (Theron) and Joe’s subjugated wives in their revolt to escape the enemy’s relentless pursuit and find sanctuary in the “Green Place.” Colossal action masterpiece from the fevered, genius vision of director/co-writer/co-producer Miller is a visceral and visual triumph, gleefully over-the-top and filled with enough details to keep the eyes busy after seven, eight, nine, ten viewings; it’s not enough to simply have a scope exceeding the last three pictures in the franchise put together, so the filmmakers also give the enterprise a demented thirst for the bizarre and breathtaking while focusing on the inspired themes of community, ecological ruin, feminist rebellion, and redemption. Photographer John Seale’s brightly saturated colors and bold camera angles, paired with Margaret Sixel’s polyrhythmic editing techniques (which adds velocity without sacrificing general clarity and strategy), creates heart-seizing artistic landscapes while the desert erupts in fire, smoke, blood, twisted metal, and mutilated bodies. The sort of adrenaline rush that can make even the most jaded and restless fans of visual, violent cinema take notice, stand up, and cheer (“Witness me!”). Six Oscar wins for Editing, Production Design, Costume Design, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Makeup & Hairstyling.\n\n97/100\n\nFuriosa (2024)\n\nDirected by George Miller. Starring Chris Hemsworth, Anya Taylor-Joy, Alyla Browne, Tom Burke, Lachy Hulme, Nathan Jones, John Howard, Josh Helman, Charlee Fraser, George Shevtsov, Angus Sampson, Goran D. Kleut, Lee Perry, David Field, C. J. Bloomfield. [R]\n\nThe latest visionary post-apocalyptic epic from George Miller reduces Max Rockatansky’s presence to mere wide-shot cameo, but he’s not missed in the long run because in his place stand the towering figures of resourceful “dark angel” Furiosa and deranged warlord Dementus. With the chronology/continuity of the series being so hard to pin down (if such a feat is possible), this one stands apart for being a direct prequel to an earlier story, recreating Mad Max: Fury Road’s diesel-and-smoke-clogged ruination against the gorgeous relief of all those saturated bronze sand dunes and clear blue skies, to say nothing for the recurrence of complex industrial designs and several supporting characters—pale and masked despot Immortan Joe (Hulme, replacing the late Hugh Keays-Byrne), his deformed children, the “Powder cosplay” War Boys, etc. Instead of racing end to end in a few days as an extended chase picture, however, Furiosa takes place over the course of fifteen years, tracing the kidnapping of young Furiosa from the Green Place of Many Mothers and the murder of her mother at Dementus’ hands to her being reluctantly traded to Immortan Joe at the Citadel and learning “road war” from War Rig driver Praetorian Jack (Burke) and developing the tools she needs to exact vengeance against Dementus. For more than a third of the film’s running time, Furiosa is but a child, capably played by Alyla Browne, and when Anya Taylor-Joy takes over, those big, expressive doe eyes might stand in stark contrast to Charlize Theron’s diamond-hard gaze from Fury Road, but they’re a weapon in the young actress’ arsenal more powerful than any sniper rifle or mechanical arm. Like a lengthy rollercoaster with lift-chain lulls and blazing drops, the movie’s pace may throw off those accustomed to the breakneck ferocity of some of the earlier Max outings, but Miller is working with a more detailed, sprawling and expansive palette than ever before—the viewer had to imagine or suss out world-built meaning earlier, now they’re treated to an almost encyclopedic survey of the Wasteland. It’s not quite as exhilarating as Fury Road or Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior were at their thunderous best, but it’s denser and deeper and delivers a few franchise-burnt surprises in how the story is told and how the jagged, tangled paths of hero and villain hearken back to classic narrative structures ranging from archetypal Westerns to Ben-Hur. As that hero and villain, Taylor-Joy (desperate and cunning), Browne (distressed and shell-shocked) and Hemsworth (crazed and giddily theatrical) are each outstanding in their specific, character-devoted ways—to paraphrase the shiny-and-chrome War Boys and the oil-smeared protagonist, witness them, remember them! With this scorching origin story, Furiosa is more “known” than Max ever was, and just wait until you see how her precious seed finally gets planted. Hemsworth’s real-life wife, Elsa Pataky, appears briefly. Also known by the lengthier title of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\n\n90/100\n\nCheck back in tomorrow for the next daily update!"
