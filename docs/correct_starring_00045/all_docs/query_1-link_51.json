        "text": "Season 2, Episode 11 (originally released on August 3, 2018)\n\nStrap yourself in and prepare yourself for a thrilling ride as the boys sit down for the first time after their vacation to discuss MAD MAX! Directed by George Miller and written by George Miller and James McCausland, MAD MAX is set “a few years from now” and shows society as we known it on the down swing. Main Force Police, or MFP, is patrolling the roads from ruffians, ragamuffins and crazed motorcycle gangs. Max Rockatansky is the MFP’s top officer. MFP finds themselves going after a violent, sadistic motorcycle gang lead by a charismatic psycho known only as the Toecutter. He leads his group from town to town and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. They’re put on Max’s radar after his partner Jim Goose is burned alive by one of their underlings but it becomes a tale of revenge after Max’s wife and son are killed. With the law no longer on his side, rage in his heart and a super-charged V8 Interceptor on his side, Max vows to chase down and kill the Toecutter and his gang. MAD MAX, upon release, wasn’t well received at first. A lot of critics didn’t get the film and panned it for its violence, incoherentness and the killing of children, but that’s not to say the film did bad. Variety praised George Miller’s directorial debut, it grossed $100 million worldwide, awarded three Australian Film Institute Awards and spawned three sequels (THE ROAD WARRIOR, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME and MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) Mad Max was the first major leading role for Australian actor Mel Gibson and also stars Joanne Samuel, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Geoff Parry and Steve Bisley.\n\nCheck out our sponsor Vinegar Syndrome at www.vinegarsyndrome.com and Mill Creek Entertainment at www.millcreekent.com"
