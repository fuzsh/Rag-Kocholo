        "text": "Exploring weather and all it entails\n\nWelcome to the DRAW Blog! Our focus here is to introduce topics related to DRAW and weather. This could be background information about parts of the project (such as symbols), discussion on weather issues (such as climate change), or may simply be a way to get to know the DRAW team further. Check in regularly for new posts!\n\nReflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs\n\nMarie-Laurence Caron created three Blogs for the DRAW Project as a Practicum student from the McGill School of Information Studies in 2023. The blogs are on the DRAW site- Rescue Weather Data to help Researchers!, https://draw.geog.mcgill.ca/en/connect/blog#Blog84 Weather and Disruption https://draw.geog.mcgill.ca/en/connect/blog#Blog87 and the History of Weather Observation at McGill University. https://draw.geog.mcgill.ca/en/connect/blog#Blog88 This piece is her reflection on this experience originally done in a video format. We have provided the script and images from the video due to space issues in making the video available online. As part of their practicum, School of Information Studies Students are asked to create a short video on their reflections on the online participatory archives experience of DRAW including search strategies employed, rational behind the selection of three blog narratives and lessons learned.\n\nHere is the script for her video,\n\nBoolean Search\n\nThe process leading up to my final project for the practicum at DRAW began with the Boolean Search activity (Fig. 1) I had to do to explore different sources on which was stored useful records and materials that could potentially serve to create outreach posts and materials for the DRAW Archive at McGill. During the Boolean Search process, I was able to see what was there in the databases I queried and searched for this project, and also what wasn’t there as well. By doing a Boolean Search, I was able to discover new themes that were outside of the suggested keywords and terms to use at the beginning of my search\n\nSome examples of the databases I queried for this project included the McGill Yearbooks, (Fig. 2) which included records that had been scanned and archived at McGill. Although the Boolean Search was less effective and impossible to perform on this platform, it was still an interesting resource to consult for images taken of McGill in the past.\n\nMcGill Student Publications (Fig. 3) on the Archive.Org website were a bit easier to search for than the McGill Yearbooks I first queried. One the major problems I faced during my search was that the Boolean terms are not recognized as operators in this platform, which mean that if I typed in “McGill” AND “Ice”, for instance, it would include “AND” as a term in my query, rather than rejecting it as a Boolean operator. Even so, this database platform still helped me to find useful content specifically related to events that happened at McGill.\n\nLastly, one of the databases I was able to explore in this project was the Historical Newspapers Montreal Gazette database found on the ProQuest provider. (Fig. 4) This platform was ideally suited for Boolean search. The Advanced search function, which you can see here allows users to enter separate terms and link them together in a query with the Boolean operators AND/OR/NOT, which ended up being quite useful for me to find relevant materials for the three blog posts I had to write for the DRAW archive later.\n\nDocumentation of Search Strategies\n\nThe provided keywords words I had received at the beginning of my search seemed at first to be highly relevant to the needs and main purpose of my project. For instance, some of the suggested keywords I had to use for my Boolean search included: “ice and flood” and also “flood” and “damage”, which one would think would return good results when used in a Boolean search in various platforms and databases. However, that wasn’t always the case. (Fig. 5) The key terms and the results returned by the databases varied greatly in terms of relevancy and precision, depending on which one was queried. By starting the process of my project with a Boolean Search, I was thus able to determine which search strategy worked best and which ones didn’t as well. Documenting the search strategies for future users of DRAW was not only helpful for other users on the website, but also to me as well when I had to go back and think about the selection of the three narratives for the next step of my final project. (Fig. 6)\n\nSelection of Three Narratives (Fig. 7)\n\nOnce the search strategies were fully developed and prepared, it was now time for me to go back and think about which narratives I would select for my project and also where I would have to go to find relevant materials in databases. The main goal for my practicum project was to find and select three key narratives with themes linked to the weather. (Fig. 8) It had to include disruptive weather events that occurred at McGill and Montreal as key facets of the topics covered, since those are all key aspects that define DRAW as an archive about weather data. The selection of the three narratives thus forced me to think about what makes a narrative stand out for current and prospective users of that archive. Based on the experience I gained in this practicum, the three aspects I determined to be essential to make good outreach materials for an archive were: Variety. Quirkiness. Relevancy. (Fig. 9)\n\nSelection of Three Themes\n\nNext, once I had found the three narratives that fit the three aspects and criteria I had set for myself during this project. I now had to determine the recurrent themes I encountered in the articles and materials that I found. Some questions that arose during this step of my project were: How to best summarize the key themes of a narrative? How to differentiate one story from another? I thus thoroughly analyzed the three articles and narratives I’d selected for my project and answered those two questions, which led me to organize the outline I had to deliver with my identified themes and keywords for review and approval by my site supervisor before I could start to create the three blog posts that would serve as outreach materials for the DRAW Archive.\n\nOutline\n\nPreparing good outreach materials was more challenging than I thought and had planned. Outlining forced me to think not only of the content and key themes of my blog posts which I did for this project, but also about the visual aspects as well, such as the photographs and images I would use, which would be attached with the narratives I’d selected to catch the eye of the users who would then find them on the DRAW website. (Fig. 10) Finding photographs and visual aids for my narratives was a process that forced me to re-think the key themes of my three blog posts since the images attached with the articles I wrote would need to be relevant to what I discussed while also eye-catching to the viewer. (Fig. 11) Outlining was thus something that not only made me think of what I had done so far in the project, it was also a step that forced me to think ahead for what I had to do and what the result would look like, to both the users and the archivists of the archive.\n\nFinal Outreach Material\n\nFinally, it was time to write the three blog posts for my project. For me, this was the most satisfying part of the practicum since it allowed me to use all the knowledge, I had learned in the past few weeks at DRAW to then deliver a good final product based on the hard work I had done in the archive and the ideas I had developed and planned with the help of my site supervisor at DRAW. Creativity played a role in making outreach materials for the archive. While writing the three blog posts, I also found additional sources to use which I had not thought about before during my previous search and planning. I was thus able to further link and attach new materials to the three narratives I had selected for my project, which made the content of my final blog posts feel more full and complete, and interesting to the users of the DRAW Archive. (Fig. 12)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, what I learned from this experience is first how to make use of the free resources that are available to the archivists working in an archive.(Fig. 13) Becoming familiar with the various databases online which contain free materials and articles related to the ones stored and preserved at archives like DRAW adds value to the search and experience of the user when they come to visit the website of the DRAW Archive to find key data about the weather for their projects or research. By documenting my search process and search strategies, I was able to learn how to point users to resources online, such as databases and online archives, and connect the records they would find on those other sources to the ones they would find at DRAW. Documenting the search strategy was thus a step that involved literacy instruction, which for me is a key task for archivists when they create outreach materials targeted to the users of the archives.\n\nFig.1 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.2 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.3 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.4 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.5 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.6 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.7 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.8 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.9 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.10 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.11 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.12 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nFig.13 Screenshot from Marie-Laurence Caron’s video on Reflections on the Research and Presentation of Three Draw Blogs.\n\nDRAW Participatory Archives: Reflections on the experience by a Practicum student\n\nAs part of their practicum, School of Information Studies Students are asked to create a short video on their reflections on the online participatory archives experience of DRAW including search strategies employed, rational behind the selection of three blog narratives and lessons learned.\n\nPallas Lau was a SIS Practicum student working for DRAW in the Winter term 2024.\n\nHere is the script for her video,\n\nWelcome, everyone. Today, I’m excited to share with you an incredible journey of discovery, learning, and contribution during my practicum at DRAW McGill, an experience that has profoundly shaped my understanding of archival work and its significance. As a practicum student tasked with exploring historical weather events through McGill's archives, my adventure into the past was both enlightening and inspiring.\n\nBoolean Search\n\nMy journey began with a foundational task: the Boolean search. This initial step was crucial, serving as my entry point into the vast historical records and narratives harbored within the DRAW Archive. This process was not just about finding information; it was about uncovering the layers of stories that have been woven into the fabric of the McGill community and Montreal at large.\n\nI approached this project by seeking out specific weather events that I find interesting and outstanding. Firstly, I went to do a Boolean search. Using the database found on the ProQuest provider. I decided to use the Montreal Gazette, Quebec's oldest daily newspaper and the oldest continuously published newspaper in Canada. There were so many stories to choose from, so I had to use special search terms and strategies. Flipping through the archive, you can see centuries of local history, many of it about weather.\n\nFocusing on the positioning of McGill University in the city, I chose to first write about the flood in 2013, named the McGill Flood. I was able to use the search terms of “McGill” and “flood” and “2013” to find as much as I could on the topic.\n\nI was then interested to see if McGill Observatory was involved in the handling of any major weather events in Montreal. Fortunately, I had a list of suggested search terms from DRAW, including a variations of weather indicators like “icy,” “smoke”, and “deluge.” I used the terms “weather” and “Phenomenon” with the AND operator, which brought me to the 1932 solar eclipse. Similar to the 2024 solar eclipse, this one was visible from parts of Quebec, and McGill University was instrumental in the city’s managing of the celestial spectacle.\n\nFinally, I did another search on disasters, focusing on Montreal’s notorious cold weather. You can see here that just looking up “cold” yields many results – this means I should pivot and refine my search. I used the search terms “snowstorm” and “blizzard”, which led me to a fascinating event in 1936 when temperatures in Montreal reached a record low in May. I then was able to learn from the article, and search for more information about the event, including the involvement of McGill Observatory. (\"McGill\" AND \"snowstorm\" AND \"blizzard\").\n\nI documented all my search strategies in a document for DRAW’s future use, so that other volunteers can learn from my search strategies to find interesting narratives surrounding the McGill Observatory.\n\nWhen I had gathered a group of events that I was interested in, I began to reflect on reoccurring themes and the McGill Observatory’s involvement and impact with the city of Montreal. I did notice that the Observatory used to provide weather readings for the paper, so using “McGill Observatory” as a search term alone yields daily results from several years of the publication. Noting the observatory’s responsibility, I began to write about the cold wave and eclipse events, bringing in evidence of the Observatory’s suggestions and directions for citizens. Nevertheless, I chose my three topics as they seemed the most provocative; I felt that writing about the 1932 would be a timely choice for 2024, as Quebec enjoys another solar eclipse, and that a cold wave in May would provide frustration for Montreal citizens in any years of its history.\n\nDeep Dive into Selected Narratives\n\nAmong the many stories I encountered, three stood out for their significance and the richness of the narratives they offered:\n\nThe McGill Flood of 2013: See https://draw.geog.mcgill.ca/en/connect/blog#Blog94 This event was a testament to the resilience of the McGill community in the face of unexpected disaster. Through articles and photographs, I pieced together a narrative that highlighted not just the chaos of the flood but the collective effort to overcome it. This story was emblematic of the broader themes of community strength and resilience against environmental challenges.\n\nThe 1932 Solar Eclipse: (Check in on September 9th, 2024 for this blog) Delving into this celestial event, I explored its anticipation and impact on Montreal, with a particular focus on the role of the McGill Observatory. The eclipse offered a unique lens through which to view the interplay between science, community, and the natural world. It was a story of collective excitement and scientific endeavor, enriched by the visual aids from Le Samedi, which captured the public’s imagination and engagement with the event.\n\nThe Cold Wave of 1936: See https://draw.geog.mcgill.ca/en/connect/blog#Blog96 This narrative highlighted the unpredictability of weather and its immediate effects on daily life in Montreal. Through the records and data from the McGill Observatory, I explored the implications of such extreme weather events on the community, drawing parallels to contemporary concerns about climate change and environmental resilience.\n\nCrafting Outreach Materials\n\nThe culmination of my research was the creation of three blog posts, each telling the story of the selected narratives with a focus on their historical and contemporary relevance. These posts were designed not just to inform but to engage the DRAW McGill audience, connecting them with the past in a way that was both educational and compelling.\n\nThe process of writing these posts was an exercise in creativity and synthesis, requiring me to weave together facts, narratives, and visual aids into cohesive and engaging stories. It was a challenge that pushed me to apply all the skills and knowledge I had acquired during my practicum, and the result was deeply rewarding.\n\nConclusion\n\nReflecting on my time with DRAW McGill, I am struck by the profound sense of purpose and responsibility that comes with archival work. It is a role that extends beyond the mere preservation of history; it is about making history accessible and meaningful to the wider community. The opportunity to contribute to this mission, to be a part of a team dedicated to the democratization of historical data, has been both humbling and inspiring. This practicum has not only enhanced my skills as a researcher and writer but has also deepened my appreciation for the power of archives to connect us with our past, inform our present, and guide us toward the future. As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I carry with me the lessons learned and the inspiration drawn from this incredible experience.\n\nThank you for joining me on this journey of discovery, learning, and connection. It was an unforgettable adventure, one that has left an indelible mark on my understanding of the importance of archives in preserving and sharing our collective memory\n\nCollage of images on the McGill Flood of 2013 from the Montreal Gazette, dated January 29-30, and February 2, 2013, from the Gazette Pro Quest newspapers, created by Pallas Lau.\n\nCloudy and Cooler Weather but a historic celebration on Convocation Day\n\nOne could say that studying the weather involves an attempt to glimpse at the future. Weather forecasts are the predictions influencing our plans and choices and our expectations and attitudes for the day to come. In the top-left corner of the front page of the June 9th, 1922, edition of The Gazette (Figure 1), the weather forecast for the day simply reads: “cloudy and cooler” (“Weather Forecast”, 1922). Similarly, on the eve of the ceremony, the soon-to-be law and medicine graduates gathered at the new medical building to hear the class prophets share their own predictions. Instead of overcast skies, the class prophets foretold successful careers, shifts towards profitable or dubious enterprises, and even the “humorous” prospect of a feminist future (“Medicine and Law Heard Prophecies”, 1922).\n\nPredictions are often most interesting in hindsight. For instance, the weather forecast on June 9th, 1922, predicted a gloomy and colder summer day. Yet, that day marked a grand celebration, a bright and joyous moment that would go down in McGill history. That spring, five brave and determined young women – Eleanor Percival, Jessie Boyd, Lilian Irwin, Winifred Blampin, and Mary Childs - were the first women to receive their medical degrees at McGill. They can be seen in Figure 3 standing in the front row alongside their cohort. The cooler June weather, however, was suited to the frosty relations behind the photo. Their male peers, who vastly outnumbered them as the yearbook photo showed, were quite vocal in their disagreement with the women’s acceptance into the program. Earlier in their studies Miss Boyd’s house had been picketed by many of her male peers who demanded she and the other four withdraw from their studies.\n\nElements from archives such as this photo allow us to look back in history and see just how our political climate has changed alongside the meteorological weather, an element subtly present to some degree in most photographs, and one that can tell us a lot. In recent years the power of citizen science in sourcing and making sense of data for archives has been harnessed more and more by organizations. The draw of the archive as a place for widening one’s perspective and learning about history is already attractive, and the beauty of participatory archives is the way they allow users to engage directly.\n\nDRAW is an archive of scientific records sourced directly from the McGill Observatory and transcribed by members of the community. Beyond allowing for collaboration and participation, DRAW helps us capture data-based markers that allow us to understand weather conditions. This data allows us to interpret and speculate how that weather impacts human experience. The weather impacts our daily lives from the activities we do to the clothes we wear. It can significantly influence the course of our day. For example, the McGill Convocation on June 9, 1922, was a cloudy Friday with some heavy morning showers. The images chosen from a 1921-1922 copy of The McGill News display black and white photographs of 1922 McGill graduates in their caps and gowns (Figure 4 & 5). In one image, the graduates are lined up to go into The Convocation Hall (Figure 4). As a participatory archivist of DRAW, one may speculate that the grounds were muddy from the earlier rainfall. In another image, graduates convene outside The Convocation Hall (Figure 5). Understanding the weather data and observing accompanying images may lead one to question whether the rainfall and cooler weather impacted the event's attendance. Nevertheless, these specific images were selected to underscore the influence of weather data on our everyday experiences.\n\nFigure 1: June 9, 1922 (Page 1 of 24). (1922, June 9).

This peculiar weather phenomenon, a mingling of seasons out of step with expectations, prompts a reflection on the unpredictability of weather and its profound impact on the community, as observed through the lens of the McGill Observatory's records.\n\nThe month of June, often heralded by the warm embrace of summer, presented an anomaly that left even weather reporters puzzled. James Russell Lowell's musings on the rarity of a day in June took on a new meaning as the city experienced its coldest temperatures in three years, with a startling minimum of 43°F. This departure from the norm was not only a record for recent Junes but a clear indication of the unpredictable dance of climate patterns. Even more startling was the belated blizzard that blanketed the city in May, breaking all records for the month since weather recording began in 1875. With 1.3 inches of snow falling and temperatures fluctuating wildly, Montrealers were forced to reconsider their expectations for the season. This event, unprecedented in its timing and intensity, underscored the variability of weather and its capacity to disrupt daily life, challenge preparedness, and even affect the natural cycle of planting and growth in gardens.\n\nThe McGill Observatory, standing sentinel over the city's climatic rhythms, provided critical data that not only documented these unusual events but also offered insights into the broader trends at play. Through the observatory's records, we are reminded of the delicate balance between human expectation and the natural world's inherent unpredictability. These events serve as poignant examples of how climate patterns can defy expectations, leaving a mark on the collective memory of the community and challenging the notion of seasonal norms.\n\nAs the city navigated the unexpected return of winter conditions, the role of the McGill Observatory became ever more critical. By offering forecasts and documenting these anomalies, the observatory underscored its pivotal role in the community—not just as a source of meteorological data but as a beacon of knowledge that informs, prepares, and sometimes even astonishes its audience. This intersection of science, expectation, and reality highlights the importance of continued observation and study of our changing climate, a task to which institutions like the McGill Observatory are indispensably suited.\n\nMay 21, 1936.

McGill’s downtown campus is abuzz with the annual convocation ceremony (fig. 1). Graduates mill about, happy for their long ceremonial robes in the cool spring weather, and proud family members wear the latest summer fashions from Henry Morgan (fig. 2). Chatter about a new McGill stadium floated about the convocation ceremony (fig. 3) The Montreal Gazette reported a record number of degrees being awarded this day, yet politely assured readers that the lengthy processions were not too tedious. As a souvenir, the families might have brought home a postcard showcasing an idyllic university on a calm, sunny day (fig. 4).\n\nUnlike the cool weather framing McGill’s convocation, around the globe, the conditions are less hospitable. Tornadoes, heavy storms, and ice fields are reported in the Montreal Gazette on this very same day.\n\nThe DRAW project aims to digitize the data collected by the McGill Observatory over the years. The observatory, pictured in a twentieth-century postcard as a highlight of the McGill campus (fig. 5), was erected in 1863. Records from the DRAW project’s logbooks allow us to look at the data as a whole or focus on one day for a more detailed historical weather forecast. On May 12, 1914, the day of the Convocation, Montreal was overcast with highs of 54º F in the afternoon and lows of 41º (fig. 6). The logbook record includes technical data and descriptions of the conditions that help piece together the climate of the past. Even in May of 1914, the McGill observatory’s data was used to decipher patterns in the weather. Apparently, May’s rainfall was only 5% of the 32-year-average that year, leading to droughts in the area, according to the Montreal Gazette. This led to forest fires, and while there were no clouds, the smoke and weather conditions led to decreased sunlight.\n\nAt the same time as this logbook’s creation, the public could get weather information from their local newspapers. Reporting on weather included a small feature on the front page of the Montreal Gazette, which debriefed on the previous day’s conditions. Moving beyond Montreal, the paper also reported on weather across Canada, which was said to be “fair and cool” on the 11th of May (fig. 7). More exciting news, about extreme and disastrous weather, was reported from across the globe.\n\nDevastating Tornado in Wisconsin\n\nA devastating tornado swept through southern Wisconsin on May 11, 1914, leaving in its wake four casualties, several injuries, and nearly $1M in damages (fig. 8). In some places, the tornado stretched three miles wide. “The storm reportedly blew a cement block through the roof of Stoughton High School, toppled the scaffold at the ski jump, and blew down all the phone lines in northern Albion township” says the Koshkonong Prairie Historical Society. See https://www.facebook.com/KoshPrairie/photos/a.494790447266041/2886343464777382/\n\nRecord Rain in Michigan\n\nOn May 12, 1914, a rainstorm lasting over 36 hours fell on Michigan, creating a new record for the month of May (fig. 9). The over three inches of rain that fell on Detroit flooded parts of the city, damaging property. In its outskirts, the countryside also flooded, damaging farms. One death was reported.\n\nSnowstorm in Australia\n\nSnow in Sydney is a rare affair, but on May 11, 1914, the city received 1 inch of snowfall after days of diluvian rainfall (fig. 10). Sydney’s inhabitants were surprised to wake up to discover a blanket of snow covering their city on May 12th. The last report of such atypical weather had been recorded almost 100 years earlier, in June 1836. See https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/from-ancient-frogfalls-to-modern-fish-rains-theres-snow-way-to-forecast-weird-weather-events/news-story/878246bded5e5d68c884000cee3dbae7\n\nMassive Ice Fields on Newfoundland Coast\n\n1914 was a tough year for the coast of Newfoundland. In March, a blizzard stranded and killed 132 sealers of the SS Newfoundland, and shortly after, at the beginning of April, another Blizzard (See https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/sealing-disaster-1914.php) sank the SS Southern Cross and killed 173 of its men. Barely two months after the terrible icy events, Captain Agassiz of the Uranium steamer reported unusually large icefields of 450 feet on the coast of Newfoundland, making navigation hazardous in the region (fig. 11).\n\nWeather data can be useful for animating specific historical events, like the McGill Convocation, where we can construct a vision of the past based off its cool, cloudy days. Looking out at the campus now, we can re-imagine what McGill would have looked like on a spring afternoon over one hundred years ago. However, the DRAW project allows us to manipulate this data in new ways, revealing patterns in the climate over time. This could only be done through the transcription of data.\n\nFigure 1: McGill University Convocation Programme, May 12, 1914.

The waters surged down McTavish Street, as if attempting to rewrite the storied history of the university in a single stroke. Captured dramatically by onlookers, images of students navigating the treacherous currents made headlines, symbolizing the event's suddenness and severity (Montreal Gazette, January 29, 2013). The day's chaos, later coined as “McGill’s Great Flood,” halted classes, displaced research, and stirred the McGill community into unified action. As the water rose, so did the students and staff, embodying the resilience and resourcefulness that are hallmarks of the institution (Montreal Gazette, January 30, 2013).\n\nYet, amid the unexpected torrents, one is reminded of McGill's longstanding commitment to understand and disseminating weather information—a tradition deeply rooted in the history of the McGill Observatory. Established in the 19th century, the observatory once stood as a vanguard of meteorological study in Montreal, diligently recording weather patterns and educating the community long before digital archives and online databases became the norm. This historical dedication to weather observation reflects a broader commitment to public service and knowledge—a theme that resonated profoundly during the 2013 flood. As water coursed through the streets, McGill's ingrained sense of responsibility to its community was palpable. Students and faculty pooled efforts to minimize damage, protect vital resources, and maintain a semblance of continuity amidst the chaos. The flood, while a singular event, cast light on broader themes of urban resilience and the impact of environmental events on community life. It underscored the interconnectedness of McGill's campus with the life of Montreal, a city that itself has weathered many storms (Montreal Gazette, January 30, 2013).\n\nDigital and social media played an outsized role in the dissemination of information during the flood, with videos and photographs sparking conversations and bringing the community together in support and solidarity (Montreal Gazette, February 2, 2013). In a way, these platforms served a purpose akin to the observatory of old—providing crucial information in real-time, rallying community action, and documenting a moment of significance.\n\nAs the waters receded, and the campus slowly returned to its usual rhythm, the 2013 flood remained as a marker of both vulnerability and strength. It was a live demonstration of the kind of immediate, disruptive impact that weather can have—and a testament to the importance of preparedness and knowledge. In the spirit of the McGill Observatory's legacy, the Great Flood has become part of the university's continuous narrative of engagement with the forces of nature. It serves as a modern chapter in the ongoing story of how the institution and its people rise to meet challenges, armed with the wisdom of history and a collective resolve that looks beyond the immediate horizon.\n\nToday, as we navigate through the ebb and flow of campus life, the resilience demonstrated in 2013 remains a wellspring of inspiration. It reminds us that while the McGill Observatory’s role as a physical entity has evolved, the commitment to service and the dissemination of weather knowledge continues to be as relevant as ever woven into the very fabric of the McGill community.\n\nThe Gazette, February 2, 2013\n\nThe Gazette, February 2, 2013\n\nMcGill Convocation 1913 Through the Lens of Weather Data\n\nThe sun rose on a chilly spring day on the morning of May 13, 1913. The Gazette had predicted showers; the McGill Observatory, at 8 o’clock that morning, had recorded a minimum of 46.6F -- the day would see a maximum of 56.2F. Overhead, cirrocumulostratus clouds were darkening the sky over Montreal. None of this deterred the attendees of a momentous occasion at McGill University: Convocation Day.\n\nAt Royal Victoria College, the crowd of black-robed graduates braced against the chill and threat of rain with college songs and class yells, maintaining a “general note of optimism and progress” (The Gazette, 1913). This was tempered only when Principal Peterson gave the news that McGill, without the gift of another $100,000, must delay the construction of a new gymnasium and campus; instead, he looked forward to the day improvements could be constructed, and suggested they be named Macdonald Park (The Gazette, 1913). The guest of honor that afternoon was Sir William Osler, who reflected on his past at McGill and looked to the future, and to the growth of the university on the world stage (The Gazette, 1913). Closing the event, Principal Peterson looked forward to the convocation of 1921, when McGill would celebrate its centenary, and “returning graduates would see a newer and finer McGill and glory in her achievements” (The Gazette, 1913). Despite the cloudy day and the brisk air, for the graduates, the outlook was bright.\n\nExamining archival records provides a tantalizing look into the events of days past. As participatory archivists, 111 years later, it is impossible to read the newspaper account of that day without a sense of foreboding; the very next year would see the outbreak of World War One, during which many of the class of 1913 would have fought. Many of their number, along with Dr Osler himself, would not live to see the centenary of 1921, or would return to McGill having experienced one of the deadliest wars in human history. Examining records such as the weather recorded by the McGill Observatory allows us in 2024 to go beyond the written account and reconstruct some of the sensory experiences lived by those present on that day. To the historian, such details draw us closer to our predecessors, and help us construct a richer and more detailed understanding of their lived experience.\n\nHowever, understanding past weather conditions goes beyond historical curiosity. Significantly, this data is crucial to scientists who seek to compare weather in the past with our current climate, and track changes as our world warms. 111 years later, we are living in a much warmer world. As new heat records are set every year and zombie fires linger under the snow (Yousif, 2024), our own convocation day, in May of 2024, is likely to far outstrip the conditions of that chilly day in 1913.\n\nUltimately, this data underscores the importance of archival preservation and accessibility. The weather logs, meticulously recorded by the meteorologists of the McGill Observatory and now preserved in the DRAW Archive, provide crucial information that will enrich the research of historians and climate scientists alike.\n\nThe Gazette, May 13, 1913, p. 1.\n\nThe Gazette, May 14, 1913, p. 13.\n\nThe Montreal Daily Witness, May 14, 1913, p.10.\n\nMembers of the University Company Regiment on the stairs of the Redpath Museum in 1915 (from Wes Cross, (2022, November 10.)

The low of this day was a mild 12°c but despite the 10.4 hours of bright sunlight recorded its likely that the wage-earning population of Montreal was likely not feeling terribly enthusiastic about Spring. The effects of the Crash of 1929, otherwise known as The Great Depression, were casting an ongoing pall on the city.\n\nSamuel Bronfman, who would donate the building named in his honour to house the McGill Desautels Faculty of Management in 1971, was not untouched by the financial crisis. In 1933, Bronfman was a ‘trustee at large’ for the Jewish Federation of Philanthropies of Montreal at whose annual meeting on the 21st of May, news of a $40,000 accumulated budgetary deficit for 1931 and 1932 was announced. A sum worth almost $900,000 in 2024. Despite a concerted community effort, a shortfall in fundraising of $55,000 in 1932-33, meant that the financial outlook for the charity was bleak. An outlook made bleaker still by the fact that a reported one third of the Montreal population was dependent on direct relief from the government for unemployment at the time.\n\nHowever, despite the discouraging financial outlook, according to the Montreal Gazette, some rosy hues were appearing through the clouds of depression. One rosy hue was the posting of the McGill ‘final year lists’ announcing that 500 degrees would be awarded on the Thursday of that week while 48 diplomas and certificates would be distributed at a later “little” convocation. Ten of the degrees awarded were a bachelor of ‘Library of Science’, (a course that is now taught as a master’s degree, students of which are frequent DRAW volunteers), all ten of these degrees were awarded to women.\n\nIn 2024 all McGill degrees are open to both men and woman but an announcement that one McGill school had decided to become co-educational provided something of a buzz in 1933. The surprising heading on the May 22nd edition of the Montreal Gazette reads “McGill to Make Drastic Changes.” One of these drastic changes was to raise the diploma requirements of the School of Physical Education. From 1912 until 1933, only women were trained at McGill to become teachers of physical education which up until then had been considered something of a ‘mere frill or a fad’ and therefore only deserving of a two-year diploma. By 1933 however, the demand for P.E teachers with ‘deeper training’ had become such that it was felt a graduate degree in arts or science was a more fitting pre-requisite. Which potentially led to the second change which was of course ‘To Admit Men Students’ into the program, though no further explanation or commentary is given in the Gazette article on this decision. The first two male students, Hugh James Purdie and Tom Schofield would graduate from the McGill Physical Education program in 1937.\n\nThe week of May 21st, 1933, while still under the cloud of the depression, was nevertheless fair and warm and indeed full of rosy hues appearing through the clouds, for McGill students in particular.\n\nDRAW ledger page 2, May 21-27, 1933.\n\nMcGill University Library.

It was late spring in Montreal and while the man had enjoyed the afternoon breeze and the temperate 22 degrees celsius heat on his walk to the venue, by the time he had reached his destination, the relative humidity had crept up to a slightly uncomfortable 65%. Adjusting his clothing once more, 27-year-old Doctor James Grant found his seat just before 3pm amidst a sea of black robes and listened as Dean Harrison commenced lauding the school's recent benefactors and clapped politely as graduates of the agriculture school were awarded their degrees. The Doctor waited patiently for his cue to join the McGill convocation ceremony, but the man born on Christmas eve in a small Vancouver Island suburb wasn’t present on this day as a benefactor, or a graduate or even as a faculty member. Doctor Grant had in fact already graduated from McGill’s medical school the previous year but the events that led to his presence at this Spring convocation ceremony will absolutely astound you!\n\nOn May 28th, 1914, a mere two weeks earlier, Doctor James Grant had been too preoccupied with preparing his starboard cabin for a week’s long voyage to Liverpool to take much notice of the weather. As the ship's surgeon, Doctor Grant had been busy checking and double checking his medical supplies and surgical instruments as the ship's other 1,476 passengers and crew had made themselves comfortable for departure. Nevertheless, it was a fine afternoon as the Canadian Pacific liner Empress of Ireland sailed away from Quebec City down the Saint Lawrence river on a course to Liverpool. As night fell, Doctor James Grant turned in, unaware of a thick fog descending or the lights of another ship, a coal carrier called the Storstad, appearing in the distance downstream. At 2 a.m however, Doctor Grant became very aware as a jarring collision threw him from his ship's berth where he tumbled, landing beneath it. Flicking the light switch in the dark, Doctor Grant found the ship powerless and the uncomfortably close by sounds of metal screaming against metal followed by rushing water told the Doctor quick action was required. In his pajamas, the Doctor fought in the dark, struggling against the almost immediate list of the ship, to get first his starboard cabin door open and then to make his way to the port side. Once there he struggled to pull himself out of a porthole, that was by this time almost directly above him, getting stuck in the process. Desperate hands yanked James through the porthole into the cool night air, leaving his pajama bottoms floating in the dark water rapidly filling the ship's interior. The Empress of Ireland was sinking so quickly, Doctor Grant noted, that only three of her ample lifeboats had been successfully launched. Even more alarmingly, he saw precious few of the ship’s passengers with him on the vanishing island of the exposed hull or in the frigid water around it. Forced into the Saint Lawrence River and battling for his life, the Doctor spared only the barest of thoughts for his lost pajama bottoms as he was hauled into one of the lifeboats and rowed to shore. Borrowing a too large pair of trousers, Doctor James Grant spent hours providing critical medical care to the survivors as they made it to safety.\n\nIt took just 14 minutes for the Empress of Ireland to sink to the bottom of the Saint Lawrence River, tragically only 465 of the 1477 passengers and crew aboard made it to the safety of shore and Doctor James Grant’s care. The sinking of the Empress of Ireland would, for a short time, be Canada’s greatest maritime disaster and for many, the young Doctor would be its chief hero.\n\nShortly before the final address on that warm late Spring afternoon, less than two weeks after the sinking of the Empress of Ireland, Doctor James Grant was called to the dais by Principal Peterson. The Principal was thrilled to describe the McGill alumni’s heroic service in the aftermath of the disaster, finally revealing the reason behind Doctor Grant’s presence at the McGill convocation ceremony. In the wake of Principal Petersons glowing praise, Doctor Grant strode across the dais and shook the Principal’s hand warmly before receiving a duplicate degree to replace the original which had in fact sunk with the Empress of Ireland.\n\nDr. James F.

This ledger sheet isn’t particularly remarkable though experienced DRAW transcribers will note that there are only two entries per day instead of the more usual three or more. The almost 100-year-old handwriting is precise and even, suggesting that the person making the observations was a calm, confident individual. The few mistakes on the page have been crossed out with two neat diagonal lines with the corrections written legibly above them. The comments are easily decipherable, and equally mundane, reading fair + warm, cloudy + warm- a few scattered traces of rain, fair + not so warm, cloudy + cool to name a few. Perhaps the most exciting thing about this ledger sheet is a faintly written ‘to’ followed by a ‘b’ with a blob of ink next to it in the Weather column, hinting at some sort of pen mishap.\n\nLooking at this page, imagining anything of note taking place is a difficult task. However, the pages of the McGill weather ledgers offer a contemporary jumping off point into compelling historic events. For example, for most of late May, early June in 1934 the front page of the Montreal Gazette had an article dedicated to the forest fires threatening various parts of Québec. The scattered traces of rain that made their way Montreal on the 29th were sufficient to put out fires in Northwestern Québec the next day but weren’t long lasting enough to put an end to the fires. The fires in Québec and in other provinces continued to be a front-page concern for most of the week though they shared that spot with news that would peak the curiosity of the country and beyond.\n\nOn the 28th of May 1934, while McGill’s weather observer casually jotted ditto for fair + warm in his ledger’s remarks column, five babies would be born to one young mother in Ontario. Yvonne, Annette, Cécile, Émilie, and Marie Dionne were the first ever set of quintuplets known to survive infancy. Just four days later, on the 2nd of June, the Montreal Gazette reported that the father of the identical infants had signed a contract to exhibit the infants at the Chicago World Fair. The girl’s appearance at the exhibition never came to pass but their parents would appear on vaudeville. The appearance of the parents on the vaudeville stage circuit led to concerns that they would exploit the children and so the Dionne Quintuplets Act in 1935 was passed to make the girls wards of the Crown. Once under the guardianship of the Crown, the government exploited the children’s fame instead. Revenue was generated by allowing the huge numbers of tourists to observe the quintuplets in a specially built nursery, multiple times a day. The girls also appeared in three films and while their parents were able to regain guardianship of them in 1942, the quintuplets would find that their childhood earnings had been mismanaged leading to lengthy battles with the government later in their lives.\n\nWhich goes to show that there is a fascinating wider context waiting behind even the blandest looking ledger page in the McGill DRAW project. Uncovering this context can be a matter of cross referencing the ledger dates with the Montreal Gazette and letting history take you where it may.\n\nTitle: Weather Ledger Page, June 2, 1934, Screen capture, DRAW, Copyright DRAW.

H- 8/7/36”\n\nThérèse Casgrain and Change\n\nAmelia Keenan, a student in the McGill School of Information Studies, is a DRAW practicum intern in Winter 2024 and created this blog post as part of her practicum work.\n\nOn Friday the 10th of July, 1896 avid newspaper readers were enjoying the moderate breeze on the pleasant 23C day, a little less than their fellow citizens. The pages of both the English and French Montréal newspapers were filled with the comings and goings of Canadian Prime Minister, Wilfred Laurier and his political compatriots.\n\nSir Rodolphe Forget, attempting to find a quiet moment of exterior repose, was particularly irked by the wind’s interference in his attempt to remain au courant on the events of the day. Though, in truth, he was a little on edge from waiting. Abandoning any pretense of interest in news of the Democratic National Convention being held in the Chicago Coliseum, Sir Rodolphe rolled up his newspaper and tucked it neatly under his arm. Then he strode inside his impressive residence, past the aneroid barometer that seemed to be hovering between Fair and Change and the maids doing their invisible work to find out if the news he had really been waiting for had finally been delivered. Sir Rodolphe would find that his wife, Lady Blanch Forget (née McDonald) had indeed delivered their daughter, Marie-Thérèse.\n\nThe politicians in the papers and Sir Rodolphe had exactly two fundamental things in common. They were men and as such they held the right to vote. A right that Canadian women in 1896 were denied. However, the barometer reading on the 10th of July that year could not have been more appropriate. Change was coming for the ‘fairer sex’ in and Thérèse would be at the very forefront of the Canadian fight for suffrage. Thérèse Casgrain lead the women’s suffrage movement in Québec, fighting for the right for women to vote in provincial elections long after the right to vote in federal elections was won.\n\nThérèse Casgrain’s other notable achievements include being the first woman in Canada to lead a political party, Parti social démocratique du Québec, and ensuring that the women of Québec could receive their family allowance cheques in their own names rather than their husbands.\n\nIn later life Thérèse would become highly critical of nuclear weapons and a staunch defender of indigenous women’s rights. Thérèse Casgrain received multiple honorary doctorates in Law in recognition of her achievements, including one from McGill University in 1974.\n\nScreenshot of the McGill weather on 10-07-1896 ledger from the DRAW website.\n\nMontreal Daily Herald, 1896-07-10, Collections de BAnQ\n\nL'Électeur, 1896-07-10, Collections de BAnQ\n\nThérèse Casgrain (seated right) with her husband Pierre-François Casgrain (seated left) and their four children, Hélène, Renée, Rodolphe et Paul Thérèse Casgrain, 1896-1981, 1940, BAnQ Vieux-Montréal, Fonds La Presse, (06M, P833, S1,D225)\n\nPhotographic portrait of Thérèse Casgrain Credit: La Rose/Library and Archives Canada/C-068509\n\nThérèse Casgrain wearing a hat and a floral dress.

The historical records and weather logs which were produced and written down by the meteorologists working at the McGill Observatory throughout the years of its existence at McGill University (1863-1963) are now currently found and preserved in the DRAW Archive for researchers and users of the archive.\n\nThe meteorologists at McGill university have often used their knowledge to record and forecast the weather for major newspapers in the city of Montreal, like The Gazette, for instance. The articles of The Gazette frequently used the findings recorded in the weather logs of the McGill Observatory as a reputable source for the observation of weather events, which they would then relay to citizens in news reports. For instance, a news article in The Gazette issue of May 29, 1907, reported:\n\n\"“This year, according to the records of the McGill Observatory, shows very little else but showers and heavy rains. When these were not conspicuous, sleet and snow were registered.” Coldest in Years (1907, May 29). The Gazette\n\nThe McGill Observatory operated year-round and recorded weather on a daily basis on weather charts and weather logs, some of which can also be found in the DRAW Archive at McGill, for perusal, transcription and research. The weather logs produced by the McGill Observatory were used by scientists and meteorologists to make statistics about the weather and predictions as well to report in newspapers. For instance, on July 31st 1926, The Gazette reported the occurrence of “torrid weather” in Montreal, but also used the findings of the meteorologists at McGill to put what citizens felt into perspective by using science and statistics:\n\n“Montreal’s scientific share of the eclipse of the sun on Saturday morning was marred by mists near the Earth’s surface and fleeting clouds which obscured the sun during most of the time that the moon was intervening between its surface and the earth.” “Thousands of people flocked to see the astral phenomenon, crowds on the streets stopping to watch the progress of the moon as it made its way across the surface of the sun. On St-Catherine Street at every corner there were many people viewing the sky, and traffic was almost stopped during the progress of the eclipse.” \"While the citizens of Montreal complain of the heat of the month, statistics at the McGill Observatory show that the average temperature has been one degree lower than the normal temperature for July.” Clouds Obscured Eclipse (1925, Jan 26). The Gazette\n\nThe eclipse event had thus garnered a lot of attention from both the media and the citizens of Montreal during that week in 1925. Professors at McGill University who were also hoping to watch the eclipse from the McGill Observatory were quite disappointed by the cloudy weather that day since it made the attendance of the astral event a lot less optimal than they had originally planned and predicted.\n\n\"It was very disappointing,” said Prof. Kelly “Owing to bad sky condition. I was out early with observatory staff and others of the university interested in such matters. The eclipse started at 8:08, when the sun was only 12 degrees over the horizon. It was so low that the sun had not yet emerged from the pall of smoke hanging over the city. Owing to these conditions, we were unable to even get the time of first contact between the intervening moon and the sun.” Clouds Obscured Eclipse (1925, Jan 26).\n\nThe McGill Observatory was thus a place of observation in more ways than one in the city when it was still in operation. Weather and astral events have always been key subjects of interest and fascination to both the meteorologists working at McGill University and the citizens of Montreal. The weather logs and data that are currently being preserved and transcribed by volunteers and archivists at the DRAW Archive detail the rich history of weather in Montreal. Weather impacts both observations and key events in the city, but it can also inform the people of the present about the experiences of those in the past, as we have seen with those three stories here.\n\nHeatwave by Rostap 1897, McCord- Stewart Museum Object number M2001X.6.43.6.56 (Documentary Art Collection).\n\nThe Weather: A Peep into the Future by Arthur George Racey, 1922, McCord- Stewart Museum Object number M2005.23.245 (Documentary Art Collection) .\n\nWeather Chart, Synopsis of the temperature, cloud and precipitation, 1875-09, McCord- Stewart Museum Object number M2001X.6.23 (Archives –Textual Archives) .\n\nWeather and Disruption\n\nMarie-Laurence Caron, a student in the McGill School of Information Studies was a DRAW practicum student in Winter 2023 and created this blog post as part of her practicum work.\n\n\"The first snow in Montreal started at 7 o'clock yesterday morning and the wind also increased in velocity, the snow drifting as it fell. The local snowfall was at the rate of one inch per hour up to 9:30 o'clock last night when McGill had registered a total snowfall of 12.2 inches during that period. Snow continued at a slightly lessened rate and was yet falling at an early hour today.” Fourteen Inches of Snow (1924, Feb 21). The Gazette\n\nWeather has always been a fascination to many artists and poets. It amazes, excites, and fills our restless hearts with a sense of pure wonder as the weather changes with us and evolves, both with time and the seasons. Every year in Montreal, there is that collective moment of pure silence and dreamy awe when one first looks outside of the frosty windows of their home or their office, and then sees the first snow of the year falling ever so gently and softly on the streets below from the thick grey clouds of the dense and cold sky above.\n\nThe weather is not always so peaceful and calm, however. As the many records preserved at the DRAW (Data Rescue and Archives Weather) archive will quickly demonstrate, weather is often chaotic and unpredictable. We observe this every year in the city of Montreal, and it is especially true when it comes to the winters. Disruptive weather events occur on different scales at different times of the year. For instance, in 1924, the Montreal Gazette reported a snowstorm that occurred in Canada, which swept across the Great Lakes and Ontario before finally landing in Montreal where citizens spent the whole day battling with the aftermath of the storm. The impact of a snowstorm such as the one that occurred in 1924 can often be quite astronomical. Back then, the Gazette reported that the cost of the removal of every inch of snow in Montreal amounted to $6000. Fourteen inches of snow in just one morning in the city could thus cost up to $84,000$ of Montreal civic funds. Furthermore, snowstorms during the winter could also disrupt public transportation on a national scale. Nowadays, we often see disruptions in the city bus lines of the STM and the metro as well in Montreal when water floods in the underground subway lines. But back in 1924 in Montreal, the Montreal Tramway Company was the leading player in terms of public transport in the city. People took the trains and used the railway to get to work in the city. After the fourteen inches snowstorm occurred that morning in the eastern provinces of Canada, the Montreal Gazette reported that all scheduled trains eventually did reach their destinations in Montreal, but every one of them was delayed from one to eight hours. Railways were heavy sufferers of the storm since train tracks were located outside in the cold weather at the time, unlike the more modern underground subway lines we use today to reach the various parts of the city for work and for school.\n\nDisruptive weather events like snowstorms in the winter are therefore not only costly in terms of time, public transportation and civic funds—they can also impact the lives of citizens in major ways in the city. Historical records and newspapers like the Gazette show that deaths frequently occur on the roads of Montreal in the winter after a heavy snowstorm occurred. Local accidents are also common when citizens travel on foot to get to their university or their workplace in the city. In the snowstorm of 1924, a fractured wrist and a bruised back were reported to occur to both the train conductor and a passenger of the Canadian Pacific train once they got off at the station in the city. The Gazette noted pointedly how some engagements which were planned for the day of the storm had to be cancelled as well. For instance, a major lecture was set to occur at McGill University which had to be reported to a later date in the season:\n\n“Various engagements or events were postponed last night as a result of the storm. As A.W Crawford, director of Vocational and Technical Education in the department of Labor in Ottawa, failed to arrive in Montreal early enough last evening, the address which he was to have delivered on ‘Vocational Guidance’ under the auspices of McGill School of Social Services, had to be cancelled. A large audience gathered in the lecture hall of the McGill Chemistry Building to hear the address, which was scheduled to start at 8:30 o’clock. With regret, it was announced that the meeting would have to be called off. The lecture of Mr. Crawford will be delivered later in the season.” Fourteen Inches of Snow (1924, Feb 21). The Gazette\n\nSnowstorms can be disruptive to many facets of daily life in Montreal. Although events and civic engagements sometimes must be called off because of the heavy snowfall in the winter, it’s important to record those disruptive changes in the weather with observations rescued form the analogue McGill Observatory logbooks and placed into a database form, in the in the DRAW archive of McGill. By learning from the past and those records, we can learn and better prepare for the future by lessening the impact disruptive events can have on the lives of citizens in Montreal.\n\nMcGill Yearbook Collection, 1902\n\nMcGill Yearbook Collection, 1898\n\nHockey on the Ice, McGill Campus, about 1900, McCord Stewart Museum, Identifier MP-0000.2214\n\nUnclouding History: Peer into Montréal’s Past with DRAW\n\nAmelia Keenan, a student in the McGill School of Information Studies was a DRAW volunteer during the summer and created this blog as part of her introduction to DRAW.\n\nThe digital weather data preserved in the DRAW archive offers a fascinating window into the environmental past. As a DRAW volunteer transcriber, you can peer through that window and satisfy the curiosity piqued by Marie-Laurence Caron asking if you have ‘ever wondered what the weather was like on your birthday a hundred years ago in Montréal?’ in a previous DRAW blog.\n\nThe first step to becoming a DRAW transcriber is watching a short tutorial video narrated by then project co-ordinator Rachel Black. In addition to a brief but fascinating insight into the historical context of the weather data and its digitization, Rachel ensures that every step of the transcription process is clearly demonstrated and easily replicable.\n\nEvery effort has been made to remove the barriers to making a meaningful contribution to citizen science so following the tutorial there is an enlightening handwriting help blog to peruse. Then, after setting up your transcriber account, you are ready to start transcribing. The easy-to-use system allows you to choose a page at random or select special dates, such as your birthday, from the available weather log pages. The transcribing process is straightforward, although minor technical challenges may be encountered. Ensure you are working with a 100% page view if you find data boxes saving to unusual areas on the page, for example.\n\nYou’ll find yourself immersed in decoding the weather symbols, shorthand and inky stokes of century old cursive handwriting when transcribing. If you encounter marks that defy deciphering efforts, then the always available DRAW team will kindly help you to discern their meaning. Though for the most part transcription offers an enjoyable challenge there are also some surprises, such as a tiny newspaper clipping snippet glued into a page margin.\n\nUnsurprising, however, are the historical records of snowfall and freezing temperatures that define the onset of January in Montréal even today. A piece of chilly information that finally satisfies this volunteer DRAW transcriber’s curiosity about what the weather looked like on her birthday 100 years ago in Montréal. Now, aren’t you a little curious?\n\nA small newspaper clipping found on page 1890-09-17 to 1890-09-19 of the DRAW weather archive. Text reads- A slight earthquake is reported from Murray bay.

He retired as a McGill archivist in 2017 and has been an adjunct professor in McGill’s School of Information Studies for more than 30 years. He has been active in the DRAW (Data Research: Archives Weather) project to enable the capture of historical weather data to assist in climate change research since 2015 and joined the Audace project last year. His areas of research interest are related to online participatory archives, archival outreach, and the engagement of more communities with archival sources utilizing archival literacy.\n\nDoes a disruptive weather event necessarily imply an extreme weather event? No: sometimes, an ill-timed few centimeters of snow can create more havoc than a massive storm. But what makes an event disruptive? Currently there is definite answer to this question; in general, we know that an event is disruptive only after the disruption has occurred and is being discussed. Ultimately, what makes a weather event disruptive depends on social responses: whether, under these specific circumstances, we are vulnerable or resilient in the face of the event. This can only be grasped, understood, and ultimately predicted by combining social narratives and meteorological considerations.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to determine what has made events disruptive in the past (a century ago) and in the present (in the last decade) and how social changes influenced vulnerability and resilience. This breaks with existing paradigms that disruptive events are meteorologically extreme events; instead, disruptive events have an inherently social dimension.\n\nFor both past and present, we will use a combination of weather records and of social commentary (from newspaper articles to tweets) to both determine the meteorological intensity of that event as well as the magnitude and type of its impacts. Comparisons between the two sets in the past and in the present will help us identify what social aspects make us more vulnerable or resilient to a particular outcome of a weather event than another, and how those have changed over time. This will allow us to make predictions on what type of weather event may become more impactful in the future considering current societal and climatic changes.\n\nA key aspect will be the use of artificial intelligence, nuanced by social science insights, to detect patterns in the huge dataset of commentaries and weather information that will help reveal the sources of our vulnerability to specific types of events. For these reasons, our team has expertise in meteorology, public perceptions and technical applications, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe presentation discussed the methodology, issues in acquiring digital sources under copyright restrictions from sources utilizing a variety of standards, preliminary findings and promised discussion of the final results of this two year project at next year's forum.\n\nSt. Paul Street Flood, Montreal, 1864, McCord Stewart Museum - Identifiers: MP-0000.1828.1.22\n\nFlood in Victoria Square, Montreal, QC, 1886, McCord Stewart Museum, Identifiers: MP-14399\n\nQuebec Floods, Montreal, 2017, Wikipedia Common, File 34416135641\n\nRescue Weather Data to help researchers!\n\nMarie-Laurence Caron from the McGill School of Information Studies created this post as part of a Practicum project concerning social media and the DRAW (Data Rescue: Archives and Weather) Participatory archives. Her supervisor was Adjunct Professor Gordon Burr and a founding member of the DRAW team.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the weather was like on your birthday a hundred years ago in Montreal?\n\nThe Data Rescue Archives & Weather (also known as DRAW) contains historical weather logs dating all the way back to the 1800s. The weather data that is currently being preserved and recorded at the DRAW archives can not only be used to satisfy your personal curiosity about what the weather was like in Montreal on the day you were born, it can also be useful for researchers and professionals across multiple fields of study. Weather is perpetually evolving every year. It is one of the few things in this world that is rarely constant on a day-to-day basis when it is observed and recorded. And as global warming becomes a more pressing issue across the countries of the world, weather data from the past become particularly relevant to the modern day researchers studying this as a global phenomenon. The historical weather logs and weather data preserved and kept at the DRAW Archive of McGill thus serve as a key source of information to study how the weather has evolved and changed in Montreal over the course of many generations here in the city and at the McGill Observatory.\n\nNot only is weather data being carefully preserved at the DRAW Archive of McGill, it is also being transcribed from past historical records by both archivists and volunteers. The DRAW website provides a helpful tutorial and tools for new volunteers who are interested in drawing out information from handwritten historical weather logs so that it can be transcribed digitally for easier use and understanding. Deciphering the handwriting of written records can be quite tricky for the untrained eye. Furthermore, if you’re a researcher who needs to gather a large amount of weather data for your current research project or reports, having that data and information digitized in an archives like DRAW makes it more easily searchable and findable, which can really ease up both the process of research and data analysis. The volunteers and archivists working at the DRAW archives thus provide a valuable support for the researchers of today and tomorrow.\n\nWeather always changes. It’s often unpredictable. But you can help record the way it has changed over the years and still continues to do so. It can be quite fun once you learn the process of transcribing when you become a member of the DRAW archives on the website.

Digging through primary sources, discovering gems of information, and discerning facets of history to create context to the past, and at the centre is the archivist. Yves Lapointe has a special connection to DRAW, as he is also the Director and University Archivist for McGill University. In his role, he provides leadership, direction and guidance on archival practices and in the preservation, accessibility and promotion of the University’s documentary heritage, including the records of the weather observatory.\n\nDRAW member Lori Podolsky had the pleasure of interviewing Yves on his archival career, advice for upcoming archivists and participatory archives (such as DRAW). The entire DRAW Team thanks Yves for his time and contributions. If you would like to learn more about the McGill University Archives, you can visit their website: https://www.mcgill.ca/library/branches/mua\n\nLori Podolsky (LP): Tell me about your position as Director and University Archivist, your role within McGill University?\n\nYves Lapointe (YL): In conjunction with the MUA Terms of Reference, the Archives Act and the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information, my primary role is to provide the University with a sound recordkeeping program. The implementation of such a program in a systemic approach requires the development of key recordkeeping tools (i.e.: A University-wide Classification Plan, a records retention and disposition schedule, a global records taxonomy, and ultimately a records management platform). Combined and interconnected, they provide the necessary elements to manage efficiently and coherently the life cycle of any document.\n\nIn this regard, my role is to have the MUA provide leadership, direction, counsel and guidance on records management and archives activities to the University; to promote, raise and encourage awareness of the role and importance of records management and archives to the University community. This is accomplished through the progressive development, implementation and promotion of recordkeeping policies, procedures and guidelines, ensuring compliance with federal and provincial legislation. It is also accomplished by developing, implementing and maintaining records management and archives services for all University Faculties and administrative units.\n\nFrom my perspective, there are two aspects to consider in my role as University Archivist. The Records Management functions are to establish the appropriate framework to ensure the University manages its information assets through their life cycle according to requirements and best practices. As University Archivist, my role is to make sure that the University preserves its documentary heritage as well as all the necessary and required records of our institution for future generations. As archivist, my role is also to make available and accessible the archival material for research purposes, exhibits, student learning, etc.\n\nLP: How did you become interested in archival work?\n\nYL: I became interested in archives while doing research with primary sources during a course history class. I was working towards my BA in History doing research under the direction of Dr. Jean-Pierre Wallot, who was also National Archivist of Canada at the time. My research was on Montreal blacksmiths – how they worked, their tools, belongings, equipment, day-to-day work. I had to use inventories developed by notaries in the 1850s to get the information I needed. Those inventories located in the archives revealed so much. As things evolved, I became more attracted to this newly discovered field. I then decided to take a certificate in archival studies, followed by a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science.\n\nLP: What drew you to archives as a profession?\n\nYL: There is certainly more than one aspect that attracted me to the field. After learning about historiography and other facets of history, as I was digging through primary sources, I became more and more aware of their very often underestimated value, and gradually discovered the behind-the-scenes of an archive. I became more and more interested in the field and realized there was a place and a role for me to play.\n\nLP: How did you become involved in DRAW?\n\nYL: I became involved in the DRAW project immediately after my arrival in the Archives, during a homecoming event where we were introducing the platform to participants.\n\nLP: What role do you have in the project?\n\nYL: My role in the DRAW project is somewhat limited. Most of the project was already in place upon my arrival, relying on a great pool of experts. Nevertheless, I became a strong supporter of the project, promoting it during conferences, lectures in archival and information studies classes. We also developed hack-a-thon sessions to raise awareness and encourage crowdsourcing participation.\n\nLP: What archival advice would you provide to new and upcoming archivists and to those doing archival research?\n\nYL: Archivists are now coming out of school with impressive and robust training programmes. The challenges of the archival field and the profession are numerous. However, for the last few decades the biggest of them seems to reside in the management of electronic records and long-term digital preservation. As technology never ceases to evolve and change, as archivists our challenge is to continuously adapt to make sure access to these archives is possible, in the near and distant future. New archivists should therefore learn as much as possible about all the different technologies that surround information. Artificial intelligence is one emergent technology that sounds very promising and for which very little has come out so far. In a not-so-far future, we might witness the possibility of performing deep analysis or any other archival functions on archival records’ data, either born-digital or digitized with optical character recognition.\n\nLP: What is an archival collection or fonds?\n\nYL: An archival fonds is basically all of the documents that an individual or an organization has accumulated, produced, or received in the course of their duties or activities throughout their life. For a professor, for instance, it would be all the courses and conferences delivered, research files, honours and awards. For an organization it would be all the records closely tied with its mission and based on its activities. A collection, however, is the result of the accumulation of material at random, being therefore the complete opposite of a fonds. In many instances both concepts are very often used to identify the same entity. Moreover, the ensemble of all the fonds in an archival institution’s repository is also identified as the collection, meaning the holdings.\n\nLP: How is an archival collection acquired? How do you decide on whether or not to acquire an archival collection?\n\nYL: There are several aspects to consider in the process of acquiring a fonds. It has to be within the scope of the unit’s mandate and part of its acquisition policy and strategy. There are a number of criteria to look into such as its size, the research potential, the connection with other fonds or collections, the medium- and long-term preservation requirements, the presence of prohibitive restrictions, etc.\n\nLP: How is an archival collection processed and described?\n\nYL: After acquiring a fonds or a collection, to facilitate their access, they are processed and described according to recognized and well-established principles and standards in the field. In Canada, for the last thirty years, the Rules for Archival Description (RAD) have guided how fonds and collections should be described. Although it may seem a long time, because of the vast quantity of archival material involved, it is not always possible or needed to have a detailed description of all the holdings of an archive, especially not at the item level. A fonds or collection will go through the process of arrangement where it will be organized in homogeneous and logical series or levels based on the creator’s activities. The ultimate result of the processing, arrangement and description is what archivists call a finding aid. It has become best practice to process from generic to specific and gradually enhance archival descriptions. The finding aid can therefore evolve progressively providing descriptions to fonds level, series, sub-series, files and eventually item level.\n\nLP: How is an archival collection made available to people?\n\nYL: Once a fonds or collection is processed, and the finding aid is ready for dissemination to the public, it can be made accessible on the archive’s web site. For many years, finding aids were made available in an individual file. The McGill Archives uses Access to Memory (AtoM), an online archival description and access system which allows us to have all of our holdings available and easily accessible, with a search capacity. This allows users to get an account of material we may have before coming to the Reading Room for consultation. More and more we are making the fonds and collections available with digitized copies of some material. If not available online, then the material can be made available to users in the Library and Archives’ Reading Room, if there is no restriction.\n\nLP: Who can access archival collections?\n\nYL: Unlike books in a library consultation and lending environment, archival collections in general are not in an open access and cannot be taken out of the institution that holds them. However, McGill University being a public institution, it is possible for researchers and the public to access the fonds and collections held in the Archives. Because of the nature of archives, and the resources available, it takes time to have the requested material ready for consultation. So, it's always a good idea to send a detailed research request before visiting the archives, either online, by phone or in person; and plan the upcoming visit to the Reading Room for consultation.\n\nLP: What new collections have you acquired?\n\nYL: One of our recent acquisitions, that is in some interesting ways connected to DRAW, is the fonds of Emeritus Professor Lawrence Mysak, former director of the Earth Systems Modelling Group in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill. Although the fonds has not yet received archival processing and description, it is accessible.\n\nLP: What archival collections relate to DRAW?\n\nYL: The material for the DRAW project derives from several fonds or collections in the McGill Archives. The fundamental ones come from institutional records from the Department of Meteorology at McGill, and consist of the Weather Observatory Registers, where meteorologists meticulously recorded their four to six daily observation logs. Complementing these records, the MUA also holds the Albert John Kelly Fonds. Albert J. Kelly was Director of the McGill Observatory from 1922 to 1943, and well-known to the public as a weatherman and also as a timekeeper for the nation's railroads and many of its industries.\n\nLP: Participatory archives and the role of the citizen archivist has been gaining momentum in the archival community. How do you implement these initiatives in your archives?\n\nYL: In recent years, we witnessed the emergence of citizen archivists’ participation in providing additional help to enhance archival description. DRAW is an extraordinary and complex example where the contribution of the public can benefit everyone and serves to raise awareness. The establishment of an initiative of that sort requires resources that go beyond those of an archive. This inevitably involves having a multidisciplinary team. Technology is also a very big part of the equation. Projects have to be developed carefully to be sustainable. There are many other ways of engaging citizens into participating in archives, like promoting on social media, having online events. A first consideration should be given to the media type before developing a crowdsourcing initiative to have a clear objective to reach. It can be easy to engage the public in an initiative but making it lasting can be very challenging.\n\nLP: What roles does the citizen archivist play in the future or evolution of archives?\n\nYL: Citizen contribution seems to be very promising for the evolution of archives. The archival community has demonstrated a willingness to open the door much wider to public participation in providing information to digitized material, transcribing letters, translating them, providing locations, dates and names to photographs. Will that be necessary for born-digital archives? Although the community has triggered and witnessed many very interesting citizen participation initiatives involving archives, I believe we have yet to see the full potential of this digital humanities component. In this equation, archivists should not forget that citizen participation relies on these two crucial elements, citizens and participation. The challenge archivists will continuously face is engaging both to be successful.\n\nLP: How is DRAW an example of participatory archives?\n\nYL: DRAW is an excellent example of archival crowdsourcing because of its multidisciplinary aspect. Often the need to develop a citizen contribution and participation comes from the archive itself, to complete information about the material or the object, which is the usual goal. With the DRAW project, this goes a little further as once the material is transcribed, not only will the data be available for reuse, it will serve to complete weather information that was dormant for the last 150 years, adding it to the already complex Canadian and internal weather data in hope to better understand several aspects of climate change.\n\nPost-processing: Where's all the data? (Part One)\n\nDRAW has been up and running for a number of years now, and citizen scientists have been faithfully transcribing pages from the McGill Observatory weather logs. We have over a million pieces of data. So you may be wondering, when can we see some data? What are the results? Is there any scientific analysis coming out of this project?\n\nThanks to a grant from the Bieler School of the Environment, Dr. Victoria Slonosky and Nathan Leuranguer have been working this summer on the first steps of data transformation, what we’ve been calling post-processing. “Post”, because it’s after the observations have been transcribed from the image files to the database through the web app. “Processing” because, well, there’s a lot of work to be done to the transcribed data before we can start to analyze it scientifically.\n\nWe’ll describe some of the steps here and in future posts. It’s complicated! Not only do we want to clean up the data, we also want to track any changes, and to track why we’re making changes. All of the original transcriptions stay the same, and the amended values move forward in a copied version of the data. We’re also creating flags, so that at each step we know why a value was amended, what the original value was and what the changed value is. A value might be changed more than once on its post-processing journey.\n\nScreenshot of a table indicating changes made to transcribed data during post-processing.\n\nAs a test, we decided to start with looking at the pressure values. The first thing to check is whether an entry is of the right type. For pressure, temperature, and other measurements, is the value entered a number?\n\nNathan spent several weeks just inspecting the database, running manual queries for many different conditions to get an idea of what the data looked like. In the process, he came across a number of stray characters in the data entries.\n\nNathan found all of the following non-standard characters in some of the numerical data entries:\n\n? * & , # ^ @ $ ( ) [ ] { } “ / .. (more than one decimal point)\n\nRunning many similar queries allowed us to understand common patterns in how transcriptions can and do go wrong.\n\nScreenshot of a table indicating transcription issues identified during post-processing.\n\nAll of these mistakes, non-standard keyboard entries, typos and other stray characters need to be removed and flagged as a first step.\n\nNext, we looked to see if the pressure values had the number of digits we expected — generally two digits, a decimal point, and then two or three values after the decimal point. It’s very easy to mistakenly type 2.938 or 293.8 instead of 29.38 when the pressure is recorded in inches of mercury, as it is in the DRAW records. These are easy to fix and flag automatically, by multiplying or dividing by 10. Less easy to fix is a situation which many of you have no doubt come across when transcribing pressure: what do we do when there are no leading digits, that is, no numbers, such as 29, before the decimal point? This turned out to be much trickier than we anticipated, and will take a blog post of its own to answer.\n\nExample of a logbook page where the leading digits of the barometric (pressure) values were not recorded by McGill weather observers.\n\nKeep an eye out for future blogs by Vicky and Nathan that will treat other challenges in post-processing!\n\nLawrence Mysak’s Memoirs - Part Four\n\nEarlier this year, we had the privilege of publishing three extracts from the memoirs of McGill Emeritus Professor Lawrence Mysak, who made enormous contributions to 20th and 21st century climatology, especially in oceanography, climate variability, climate modelling, and other fields we’ve read about in this series. Professor Mysak has graciously offered us two more extracts of his memoirs, which we will be sharing on the DRAW blog in this post and a future one.\n\nThe McGill University Archives recently acquired Professor Mysak’s papers, which will be available for future researchers and historians of science.\n\nAllan Robinson: My Harvard PhD Supervisor (written February 15, 2022)\n\nIn September 1964, the beginning of my second year at Harvard as a PhD student in applied mathematics, I enrolled in the course “Geophysical Fluid Dynamics” (GFD). I was fascinated by fluid mechanics and wanted to write a PhD thesis in this general area. Since Canada is surrounded by three oceans, it made sense for me to consider a mathematical problem in ocean dynamics. This GFD course, about the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, would certainly give me a good background to do this type of research. But who was Allan Richard Robinson, the instructor for the course?\n\nIn my first year at Harvard, I took two courses from Professor George Carrier, whom I greatly admired for his brilliance and enthusiasm for all things related to fluids, including oceanography. He was my first choice for a PhD supervisor. I asked him in September 1964 to consider taking me on as a PhD student later that academic year once I finished my course work.\n\n“Lawrence, I would normally be delighted to be your PhD thesis supervisor,” he said. “But next year I will be away on sabbatical.”\n\n“Oh no,” I responded. Professor Carrier saw that I was disappointed to hear this.\n\n“Why don’t you consider Allan Robinson as a potential supervisor?” he suggested. “As a recently appointed faculty member he’s on the lookout for new graduate students to supervise.” Only later did I learn that Carrier supervised Robinson’s PhD thesis at Harvard a few years ago and held him in high regard.\n\nRobinson’s GFD lectures were pedantic but informative. I quickly learned about the effects of the earth’s rotation on large-scale currents in the atmosphere and ocean, and how the ocean temperature and salinity affected the ocean’s density and overturning motion. I got annoyed at the frequent interjections by Jim Baker and Peter Niiler, Robinson’s postdoctoral students who sat at the back of the class. However, this activity livened up the classes and introduced me to the give-and-take of academic debate. Later both Jim and Peter helped me with the last chapter in my PhD thesis.\n\nThere was no final exam for the course; instead, we had to write a 10-page term paper about some topic in ocean or atmospheric dynamics.
