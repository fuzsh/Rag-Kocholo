Among other things, Guido talks about the start of Attic Entertainment, his love for text adventures, Die Drachen von Laas, The Bard's Tale and Spirit of Adventure, Brian Fargo and how Guido got to be the producer on Planescape: Torment, Amiga and Atari, as well as the difference between US and German game(r)s. (Spoiler: German games tend to focus on gameplay.)\n\n​\n\nAlso, Guido mentions how he loaded up Realms of Arkania: Shadows over Riva recently and immediately saw some really poor design there.\n\nNaturally, this interview is part of Guido's attempt to bring Deathfire closer to its funding goal.\n\nCrooked Bee\n\n(no longer) a wide-wandering bee\n\nJoined\n\nJan 27, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n15,048\n\nLocation\n\nIn quarantine\n\nnikolokolus\n\nArcane\n\nJoined\n\nMay 8, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n4,090\n\nNov 26, 2013\n\n#3\n\nIt's a goddamn shame this thing isn't going to fund.

The same can be said of Silver, although being weird is about the only thing that I remeber of that game . Darkstone is the more sane of the bunch, but stone me if I get the point of having a two-strong party in a Diablo-clone. And then there's Ishar series with the party members gleefully robbing and murdering each other and outvoting the player's decisions.\n\nNow, we can have a 100-pages discussion on the subject of difference between weird and original, of course, but I'd rather not.\n\ntheSavant\n\nSelf-Ejected\n\nJoined\n\nOct 3, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n2,009\n\nNov 26, 2013\n\n#10\n\nLandwirtschafts-Simulator 2013\n\nThousands of \"Wimmelbildspiele\",\n\nBrowser-Game-Nation #1. [...] ... shameful.\n\nYeah, Germany is definitely a weird gaming nation.\n\nI kinda agree. I don't get it, how these simulators are so successful. Not only that, are these also very very poorly made and totally bugridden. Worse than X : Rebirth. And yet - here comes the punchline - they are one of the top sales every single fucking year. But whatever... the more shit is produced the more chances appear to stand out from the crowd (if you are a developer). About the \"Wimmelbildspiele\" - I had to google what type of game they are, and oh my god... I've seen them every once in a while but always ignored them without wasting a second on them. I don't know, maybe parents buy such things for their children...\n\nSmejki\n\nLarian Studios, ex-Warhorse\n\nJoined\n\nOct 22, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n710\n\nLocation\n\nBelgistan\n\nNov 26, 2013\n\n#11\n\nThousands of \"Wimmelbildspiele\", no idea what that is in English or if this is a Germany-specific thing.\n\nGoogled only images so I might be wrong but it looks like \"Hidden object games\".

He is the founder, CEO and President of Crytek, one of the largest video game developers in Germany. Yerli is the son of Turkish immigrants in Germany. He founded Crytek in 1997 and formally turned it into a company in 1999. His brothers, Faruk and Avni, joined Crytek in 2000 and 2001, respectively.[1][2] The company developed games such as Far Cry and the Crysis series.[3] Cevat Yerli has been the director and executive producer on nearly all of the company's games.[4]\n\nSmejki\n\nLarian Studios, ex-Warhorse\n\nJoined\n\nOct 22, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n710\n\nLocation\n\nBelgistan\n\nNov 26, 2013\n\n#21\n\nMy message is check the names of the founders of Crytek.\n\nThought that. Yep, founders are of Turkish origin.\n\nHowever can you judge a company with hundreds of employees by its founders? If not, even then it gets broken quickly. Can you consider a huge multiculty company to be \"national\"? I'd bet at least half of the people there are not German.\n\nPointless discussion thou because we talk about high quality games\n\nNow seriously. I consider all post-Crysis1 Crytek games to be mediocre but goddammit I finished the campaign of Battlefield 3 yesterday (Humbe Bundle - all went to charity, suck it EA!). Crysis 2 and 3 are flawless diamonds compared to it. The shit was designed by somebody who hates games! It is so mindblowingly bad everybody should try it.\n\nKane\n\nI have many names\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n22,418\n\nLocation\n\nDrug addicted, mentally ill gays HQ\n\nNov 26, 2013\n\n#22\n\nGermany is a particularly shitty plaster to do game development. If you are an aspiring game programmer move to America. Or at least to France or UK."
