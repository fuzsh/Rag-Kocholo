        "text": "This afternoon during Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ: ERTS) press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Crytek GmbH, the award-winning developers of the Crysis\"® franchise, announced that Crysis 2 will also be available in true stereoscopic 3D. The blockbuster action game will be the first major video game on multiple platforms to take full advantage of true stereoscopic 3D. Crytek is recognized worldwide for being technical pioneers, as showcased in the universally-acclaimed Far Cry and Crysis, as well as their award-winning, proprietary CryENGINE\"® technology. \"At Crytek, we always strive to raise the technology bar. As the 3D revolution sweeps movies and television, we are excited to bring Crysis 2 to 3D, making it the first big action game to be available in true stereoscopic 3D,\" said Cevat Yerli, CEO and President of Crytek. \"The 3D experience represents a quantum leap in interactive entertainment.\n\nWith all of the same story and action seen in the 2D version of the game, the 3D version adds another dimension of intensity and immersion to the action.\" Whether played in 3D or standard 2D, Crysis 2 drops players into a devastated New York in the midst of an attack by a frightening alien species. The alien enemies are armed with deadly weaponry and exceptional sensory abilities that test players' skill and push them to the limit. These terrifying invaders stalk the streets of New York, leaving the streets in chaos and the skyline in flaming ruin. Surrounded by catastrophic destruction, players harness the superhuman abilities of the Nanosuit to level the playing field, becoming the ultimate weapon on a mission to save New York. Built on Crytek's new state-of-the-art multiplatform game development system, CryENGINE\"®3, Crysis 2 will be available for the PlayStation\"®3 computer entertainment system, Xbox 360\"® videogame and entertainment system and PC in 2D and 3D.\n\nFor more information on Crysis 2, please visit crysis.ea.com or follow the game on Twitter at www.twitter.com/crysis and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/crysis. *Additional hardware and accessories, not included with game, may be required for full 3D effects.\n\nAbout Electronic Arts Electronic Arts Inc.
