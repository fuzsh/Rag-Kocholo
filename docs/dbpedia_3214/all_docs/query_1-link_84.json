        "text": "The fourth mainline entry in the Crysis series, dubbed \"Crysis 4,\" was announced in January 2022. Since then, information has been scarce, with the game being built using the studio's in-house CryENGINE 5, and Mattias Engstrom serving as game director.\n\nGeneral manager David Fifield was asked about the current status of Crysis 4 while speaking with MP1st about the company's shooter Hunt: Showdown. Fortunately, Fifield's update was positive, stating that it is \"still in development and we have a great team working on it!\" Although the update was brief, it is reassuring that the game has not been canceled given that its predecessor was released over a decade ago, but this is the last piece of information fans should expect for quite some time.\n\nThe original Crysis was released in 2007, and it is still remembered for its mind-blowing graphics at the time, with even the most powerful consumer hardware struggling to run the game at maximum settings, spawning the \"can it run Crysis?\" meme. Since then, two sequels have been released, both of which have been remastered and praised for their visuals, performance, and mechanics."
