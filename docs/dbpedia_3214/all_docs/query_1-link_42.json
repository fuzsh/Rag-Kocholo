Create your own subject to learn superb. I wonder how many great talents remain hidden in millions of people because they've not had the chance to try things out because of the education boards across the world. At least someone is taking a step in the right direction but I doubt it will be a start to a revolution or anything .\n\nBe right back, learning German, getting a passport and some kind of residency over there.\n\nSee, this is the sort of thing we need in merry old England.\n\nI could meet all of those requirements (good understanding of German, got the Reissepass , just not a resident there - got friends there though!).\n\nLuckily, not interested\n\nI know im not in a school but our University is in the process of getting the CryEngine 2 and the Unreal 3 engine ...Cant wait. Im sure our DUAL quad more PCs can handle it with there nice 8gb of RAM And 2 GTX's!"
