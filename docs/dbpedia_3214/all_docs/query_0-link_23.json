        "text": "Doak is critical of Sony's policies, particularly the ones when he was at Free Radical. While Sony helped TimeSplitters become a reality, afterwards they became very uncooperative. FR wanted to port TimeSplitters to the PSP. Sony told them that they couldn't port it unless they added \"special features to sell the hardware\". FR wanted to set up a small team to make a bare bones port in about 4 months. Sony said no. They tried again with the Vita. Sony began demanding \"that stupid thing on the back where you could wave your fingers around\" functionality into such a port. They also wanted to port TimeSplitters to the PS3, but Sony wouldn't let them unless the port had \"new special features\".\n\nthis is mildly sad & funny, as it was always console warrior fodder last gen to why there weren't some indie/game late ports on ms consoles, and sony, for the gamers would never roll into that kind of shenanigans.\n\nAs always, again and again, for corporations business is business and comes first than developers/gamers best interests.\n\nHaven't watched the video but based on the OP's summary, Sony doesn't seem too much in the wrong. If they're publishing the game, a port without new features isn't going to go down well. People wouldn't (and still don't like) want a completely raw 1:1 port with only up-rezzed graphics.\n\nMaybe don't speak for everyone because I would take literal dumps of the old games on current hardware with no changes other than those needed to make them run, let alone something with better graphics or heaven help us added content.\n\nPhenomenal in terms of story, yes, but it controlled like a pig. The fact it came out at the same time as Psi-Ops, which controlled brilliantly but had a terrible sub-MGS story, was kind of unfortunate.\n\nIt's a shame we haven't got more psychic/telekinesis focused games, but I guess the novelty of cool physics engines died out pretty quickly.\n\nI agree that the controls in Second Sight were bad, terrible shooting aiming included, but man I had good times playing it after sort of just figuring out how to roll with the control scheme.\n\nAnd yes, the lack of psychic third person action games this generation (especially stealth focused) is really sad. Hopefully there is lots of it in Remedy's Control.\n\nWonder if itd be possible to bug sony about it. It's worked before. Would love even a basic upscale collection on ps4\n\nCrytek own TimeSplitters. (And Second Sight). Remember that they weren't asking Sony to publish the game. The problem was that Sony's policies prohibited straight remasters and ports, basically. You couldn't take an existing game and release it on Sony's platform(s) without meeting various criteria that seem kind of silly nowdays. This policy was apparently dropped towards the late 2000s, but I don't know the specifics. However, it must have persisted because apparently Sony were pushing developers to include Switch touch-sensitive features in their games, and this was in 2011. Mind you, Free Radical was merged into Crytek by 2008, and Doak was gone. However, that doesn't mean they weren't trying to do TimeSplitters stuff, even under Crytek who didn't care for the series. That's why Homefront: The Revolution has a TimeSplitters 2 demo in it.\n\nIt's kinda ironic looking back, though. People often wondered and still do wonder, \"Why did EA never release the Crysis series on PS4/XBO? Crysis 3 was a 2013 game. It was a prime candidate for a next gen port. Why did they never release a scrubbed up version of the original game for PC with the improvements of the console version?\" (The console version of Crysis was by Crytek UK/Free Radical, incidentally.) The answer is simple. EA, and Peter Moore in particular, were opposed to remasters.\n\nAt this point, the TimeSplitters ball is firmly in Crytek's court. They tolerate the TimeSplitters: Rewind project which is apparently still going but taking forever. However, if Crytek wanted to, they could release TimeSplitters 2/3 as Xbox One Backwards Compatible titles. They'd literally just have to give MS a thumbs up. They could release TS1/2/3 as PS2 on PS4 titles. Crytek's refusal to do sensible things is why Doak has such a low opinion of them, among other reasons.\n\nWait, so they did Timesplitters with just 15 people at the end and started out with 5? That's mazing. Not only does it look amazing, it was also full of content and very fun to play (I have fond memories of it).\n\nIt's also interesting how games these days require hundreds of people and - often - still end up being very short and lacking in content and/or having very long development times. That's one of the disadvantages these days maybe. Too much time seems to spend on graphics (which people demand).\n\nOn PS2 a lot of games came out and still looked great for that time. Maybe that was the biggest strenght of that era.\n\nEdit: Damn, Doak is such a cool guy :)\n\nTwo things that really don't get enough appreciation about TimeSplitters is that they were 60fps games, and they had exceptionally good facial animation. 2 and 3 in particular.\n\nI'd love to see a DF Retro episode on these games someday, as well as other 60fps titles like Nightfire. Particular which consoles ran them the best and how close they came to holding 60fps.\n\nBack when these games came out, they copped some flack for not being as graphically impressive as their peers, but I think they have a timeless art style and focusing on 60fps above all else was a wise decision. The character models aren't intricately detailed, but they're superbly animated, which more than makes up for it.\n\nDoak is critical of Sony's policies, particularly the ones when he was at Free Radical. While Sony helped TimeSplitters become a reality, afterwards they became very uncooperative. FR wanted to port TimeSplitters to the PSP. Sony told them that they couldn't port it unless they added \"special features to sell the hardware\". FR wanted to set up a small team to make a bare bones port in about 4 months. Sony said no. They tried again with the Vita. Sony began demanding \"that stupid thing on the back where you could wave your fingers around\" functionality into such a port. They also wanted to port TimeSplitters to the PS3, but Sony wouldn't let them unless the port had \"new special features\".\n\nDamnit, I would have killed for this."
