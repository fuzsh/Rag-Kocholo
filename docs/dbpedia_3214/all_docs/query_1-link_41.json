        "text": "\"Mavericks is set in a huge, photo-real, and highly dynamic environment, and CRYENGINE's high-performance rendering capabilities are just one of the aspects that make it the perfect engine for realizing the project. We’ve integrated SpatialOS into CRYENGINE, and it’s that combination at the heart of achieving an incredibly high number of concurrent players in a high-fidelity environment,\" said James Thompson of Automaton. \"We have enjoyed a very positive partnership with Crytek over the last year as our team has been building the incredible technology and game world that Mavericks will be showcasing.”\n\nMavericks is due to launch in 2018 and will support 1000 concurrent players in its ultra high-fidelity world.
