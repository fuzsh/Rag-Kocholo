        "text": "by: Nathaniel -\n\nMore On: Crysis 3\n\nIf you've followed any of Crysis 3's development, you might already know that \"7 Wonders\" is a reference to the seven zones the Cell Corporation has created in what used to be New York City. Now 7 Wonders also refers to a new Crysis 3 webseries called The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3.\n\nThe 7 Wonders of Crysis 3 is aiming for something cinematic in scope and to that end, filmmaker Albert Hughes (Dead Presidents, From Hell, Book of Eli) has been tapped to produce it.\n\nToday, Crytec has released a brief introduction video to The 7 Wonders of Crysis 3.\n\nI think you can ignore the 12/12/12 release date at the end of the video because the current release date is February 19, 2013. To learn more about Crysis 3 you can follow the jump.
