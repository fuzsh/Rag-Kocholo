FRD was the developer of the TimeSplitters series, Second Sight, and Haze.\n\n\"We see Homefront as a really strong universe that has a lot of potential and that has been expertly created and marketed by THQ,\" said Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli. \"We believe that bringing our level of quality, creativity and production values to the next Homefront title, creates an opportunity for both THQ and Crytek to deliver a truly blockbuster game.\n\n[/p]\n\nSource\n\nYou know what Crytek, FUCK YOU. Instead of making a sequel to one of the greatest FPS's ever, which still clearly has a fanbase, you've decided to go ahead and make the next batch of generic war shooters. Well fucking done.\n\nWhat I imagine Crytek is trying to get out of all of this:\n\nGahars said:\n\nThat picture couldn't be closer to the truth, Bob.\n\nSeriously, while I'm glad that Free Radical (Crytek UK now, but whatever) will at least be employed, I would much rather it be on the sequel people have actually been asking for.\n\nI haven't seen anyone actually supporting a homefront sequel.

At the very least they could make some sort of HD collection for PSN or X-Box live.\n\nAlso, this:\n\nQUOTE('Crytek')the uk audience will be very pleased with [our next project]\n\nI can't imagine anyone from any country being particularly happy about this.\n\nBobTheJoeBob said:\n\nYou know what Crytek, FUCK YOU.

This isn't a matter of them not wanting to do another Timesplitters--this is an issue of making some money so they can PAY the people they have on staff. (And Homefront, good or bad, made a ton of money the first time around and TS has been out of circulation for so long now that it's a risky investment by anyone. Once again the raging core gamers think they're representative of the general gaming populace, insofar that they think they are sufficient to make another TS profitable for the *publisher* that would fund it. This isn't going to be the case w/o a wide array of variables lining up just so and they sure as hell are going to be circumspect about it in this economic climate.)\n\nErgo said:\n\nBobTheJoeBob said:\n\nYou know what Crytek, FUCK YOU.

And the reviews gave it a mediocre score at best. Also, if they're still not sure of the demand for a TimeSplitters sequel, they can always release a HD collection to test the demand. This isn't just about them not releasing a TimeSplitters, they've been leading us on the past few months, hinting at some sort of TimeSplitters sequel, my quote from the post few posts above is an example. I doubt anyone thought of Homefront when they said that.\n\nBobTheJoeBob said:\n\nGahars said:\n\nThat picture couldn't be closer to the truth, Bob.\n\nSeriously, while I'm glad that Free Radical (Crytek UK now, but whatever) will at least be employed, I would much rather it be on the sequel people have actually been asking for.\n\nI haven't seen anyone actually supporting a homefront sequel.

Should of made that more clear.\n\nI'm glad they've got some work, Homefront isn't really in their style when you think of what they did when the members were in Rare and when they did TimeSplitters/Second Sight but if they can pull this off and make the game do well then a possible new TimeSplitters or at least something that is in their style can be made.\n\nYou've really need to consider that a talented studio needs more than talent. It recent needs a hit that has sold fairly well. Lots of companies have to live on having to do stuff they normally wouldn't to fund their studios, looks at WayForward and n-Space. They have to do the licensed games to fund their own projects, without them they'll be dead.\n\nTheir last title they released was Haze back in 2008, it didn't do very well so they could never really get a 4th TimeSplitters game greenlit. Then along comes Crytek...they invest 50 MILLION POUNDS into them so when Crytek gets given a title that did sell well they give it to one of their talented teams to prove themselves that they can still knock out a hit.\n\nSo anyone saying a \"fuck you\" to Crytek just remember they've put a lot of cash into this studio, without that cash they may have died and you'd never have a chance of TS4.\n\nHadrian said:\n\nI'm glad they've got some work, Homefront isn't really in their style when you think of what they did when the members were in Rare and when they did TimeSplitters/Second Sight but if they can pull this off and make the game do well then a possible new TimeSplitters or at least something that is in their style can be made.\n\nI can see that happening, but I can also see Crytek just ignoring it, which is definitely something I don't want. Also, Crytek UK are behind the Crysis 1 port to consoles.\n\nQUOTE said:\n\nTheir last title they released was Haze back in 2008, it didn't do very well so they could never really get a 4th TimeSplitters game greenlit.

Haze is a big part as to why FRD ended up bankrupt. And TimeSplitters 4 was already being developed before FRD went bankrupt, but they couldn't finish it.\n\nQUOTE\n\nSo anyone saying a \"fuck you\" to Crytek just remember they've put a lot of cash into this studio, without that cash they may have died and you'd never have a chance of TS4.\n\nI understand that, but WHY Homefront, the game got average reviews and I really can't see it doing well, especially in 2014 where I imagine the Wii U would have taken off and Microsoft and Sony announced their new consoles. By the way, when I said 'FUCK YOU' to Crytek. I was talking specifically to Crytek, NOT Crytek UK."
