        "text": "One of those that could be true but then it might not be but apparently someone who has just joined Crytek claims that they have created a level from Crysis 3 on the Wii U just to see what the console can do.\n\nSome details:\n\n- Crytek is NOT developing a game for Wii U, but they created a Crysis 3 level just to fully understand the console capabilities\n\n- apparently he tried this level on the last DevKit available\n\n- the game run on dx9 with a native 720p resolution, fxaa filter (it is impossible to use txaa), good framerate (30-35 stable fps), high quality texture (no pop up as in the Ps3/x360 game version due to the higher RAM amount), not fully implemented water shaders\n\n- great particles effects (ambient occlusion on par with PC version)\n\n- lighting effect on par with PC version (ultra setting)\n\n- in the dev kit he tested, it is not possible to \"turn off\" the Pad monitor, so that it always streams 480p contents\n\n- the programming staff thinks that (they are not sure) toggling off the Pad monitor, the game could run on a 1080p native resolution\n\n- may show demo on show floor\n\n- hopeful for more power if Wii U controller screen isn't utlized\n\nSource is yet another from Neogaf, sometimes they turn out to be true, sometimes they're bullshit.\n\nhttp://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=37774590&postcount=7104\n\n- the game run on dx9 with a native 720p resolution, fxaa filter (it is impossible to use txaa), good framerate (30-35 stable fps), high quality texture (no pop up as in the Ps3/x360 game version due to the higher RAM amount), not fully implemented water shaders\n\nReally starting to hate this whole \"uses DirectX\" for the Wii U and PS3 when DirectX is not only made by Microsoft (meaning that unless there is an agreement between those companies, those non-MS devices can't use it), but is simply a software connection to the hardware, much like OpenGL is. They may have started with a build that uses DirectX, but they are more than likely replacing the actual DirectX code lines.\n\nWhile devkits are out of the reach of normal people, it's not like they're the crown jewels. It's not unthinkable that a big-name company would like a devkit in order to explore the system, because it's not like they could do otherwise nearly as well without it.\n\nIt's already confirmed that Crytek UK has a devkit (they're making Homefront 2). But no one said that they were crown jewels?\n\n- the programming staff thinks that (they are not sure) toggling off the Pad monitor, the game could run on a 1080p native resolution\n\nThis is why I think the rumour is bullshit. They can easily stream a simple image to the controller and have it not take any power at all.\n\nOh and this rumour isn't actually from Neogaf. It's translated by a guy there but it's from some Italian forum."
