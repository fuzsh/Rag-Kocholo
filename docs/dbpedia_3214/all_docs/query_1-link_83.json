        "text": "External game development has become the go-to strategy for massive gaming studios looking to produce the world’s hit games. From Xbox Game Studios’ Halo and Gears of War to Crytek’s Crisis Trilogy, established developers are turning away from traditional in-house only teams to hire talent from around the world.\n\nHowever, that’s easier said than done.\n\nJuggling thousands of contractors, vendors, and studios can become an absolute nightmare. Managing contracts, communications, deadlines, and collaboration requires world-class processes and platforms. Fortunately, we have just the thing.\n\nBelow, we’ll walk you through the external game development scene in 2023 and how the world’s largest gaming studios overcome modern-day obstacles with a freelance management system like Worksuite. Data from the “XDS 2023 Insights Report on External Development” was cited with permission from XDS.\n\nExternal Game Development in 2023\n\nAccording to XDS, the leading international games industry conference, “external development refers to the practice of video game Developers / Publishers leveraging Service Providers in any aspect of development, including but not limited to art, animation, cinematics, audio, engineering, porting, game development, UX-UI, motion capture, QA, localization, and VFX.”\n\nWith the rise of remote freelancing worldwide, one would assume that external development would be easier than ever. Meanwhile, global events have actually made it more challenging.\n\nEverything from geopolitical conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic, to record-low unemployment rates, higher wages, economic uncertainty, and The Great Resignation have made it more complicated than ever for gaming studios to produce top-notch games.\n\nGrowing Demand for Games Talent\n\nYet while the market conditions get more difficult, the demand for games only increases. One study projects the gaming market size to grow by 13% annually for the next 7 years — from $282 billion in 2023 to $665 billion in 2030.\n\nDevelopers are outsourcing key aspects of the game development process to keep up with demand and meet tight deadlines — without exceeding budget constraints.\n\nHere are the top outsourced tasks in external development:\n\nArt\n\nAnimation\n\nCinematics/VFX\n\nGame development (PC/Online)\n\nEngineering (server side, front end, web development, etc.)\n\nGame development (Mobile)\n\nGame development (Console)\n\nMotion/Facial capture\n\nUI/UX\n\nQA\n\nSome studios outsource a handful of responsibilities, while others rely on external involvement to develop entire games. It all depends on the available resources, expertise, deadlines, and budgetary constraints.\n\nThe Pros of External Development\n\nGame development studios opt for external assistance for various reasons:\n\nCost savings: Outsourcing game development tasks can be more cost-effective than maintaining an in-house team for every aspect by reducing expenses related to salaries, benefits, infrastructure, and equipment.\n\nScalability: Scale up or down according to project requirements. Need extra help getting a game across the finish line? Hire outside help immediately without any long-term investment.\n\nCreativity: Engage the best talent in the world, no matter where they’re based — whether that’s hiring an animator in Spain, a developer in Armenia or a QA engineering team in India.\n\nFlexibility: Hire additional resources “on demand” for specific aspects of your project, without the need for a permanent expansion of your in-house team.\n\nEfficiency: You know how fans feel about another delay of a much-anticipated game. Prevent that from happening by improving your efficiency. With the right freelancer management system, external developers can contribute to the development process concurrently, speeding up the overall production timeline.\n\nExpertise: Leverage specialized skills your in-house team lacks (like specific animations or localization) with external contractors.\n\nExternal development isn’t all unreal graphics and ageless franchises, though. It has plenty of challenges that only the best solutions can overcome.\n\nThe Challenges of External Development at Scale\n\nAccess to worldwide talent at your fingertips might sound like it’s too good to be true. While it’s a reality the top developers and publishers embrace, the games production process is not without its headaches.\n\nThe world of external game development is full of challenges, which only get harder at scale.
