        "text": "BIO\n\nName: Janine Prince\n\nTitle: Talent Manager\n\nDeveloper: Crytek UK\n\nwww.crytek.com/career\n\nWhat differentiates Crytek UK from other developers?\n\nCrytek UK is a leading developer of CryEngine technology, pushing the boundaries of what is technically possible and therefore the overall gamer experience. Not only are we market leaders with our tools and technology but we offer great opportunities for our employees to continually develop their skill sets through ongoing peer-supported learning. We make the tools and technology that underlies some of the best games out there and that many other studios rely on, as well as developing great games ourselves.\n\nHow many staff are you currently looking to take on?\n\nWe are currently expanding here in Nottingham and as a result we have 25 vacancies to fill this year.\n\nPredominately, the vacancies are for game and R&D programmers, with some openings in other disciplines. For all of our current vacancies please visit our website: www.crytek.com.\n\nWe are a very open-minded company and feel the studio is enriched by as broad a spectrum of people and skills as possible. We have very high standards but are happy to consider a broad range of previous experience. We are currently looking not only for those with previous industry experience but searching for talented people looking for their first steps into video games. We are also looking to launch our own graduate/internship program in the near future – watch this space.\n\nWhat perks are available to those working at the studio?\n\nBy working for Crytek UK, you not only get the opportunity to work with an amazingly talented and lively team, in a newly built, state-of-the-art studio in the centre of Nottingham; but also benefit from our company benefits package which includes gym membership, cycle to work scheme, company contributed pension scheme, childcare vouchers, along with an employee assistance programme.\n\nEach year we allocate a Learning and Development budget per discipline to continue to develop the skills of our employees including the opportunity to attend industry conventions. And, I nearly forgot, the well-renowned Pastry Friday we celebrate here weekly, and the newly introduced Breakfast Club Mondays.\n\nWhat should aspiring devs do with their CV to get to an interview?\n\nWe actively encourage candidates to apply via our website. This is where our vacancies are published first. They need to take the application as an opportunity to show off what they’re capable of remembering to include samples of their work, links to online portfolios or demos, but most of all to demonstrate their passion to make triple-A games. Their CV should be up-to-date and relevant to the role they’re applying for. Keep the information succinct, as long, rambling CVs can be a challenge to review. We receive lots of applications so candidates need to make sure that they stand out.\n\nWho is the best interviewee you have ever had and how did they impress you?\n\nThe people that impress me are those who are able to display strong self-motivation and ambition. This is often accomplished by demonstrating how they have developed their own projects in their spare time. People who can show they understand the complexities of making a game in a small group and overcome significant technical challenges. It’s always nice to speak to someone who isn’t afraid of alternative solutions to previously solved problems, showing creativity and tenacity in finding an optimum solution to a challenge.\n\nAnd who was the worst?\n\nI can’t name and shame the individual, but they arrived over an hour late for the interview, didn’t apologise for being late then showed no enthusiasm throughout the whole process. They just wanted a job in the industry with no particular desire to work for Crytek specifically or on one of our games. I must add that they had applied direct for the role themselves and accepted the invite to interview, but obviously felt no need to demonstrate a compelling reason for us to employ them.\n\nWhat advice would you give jobseekers for a positive interview?\n\nBe prepared. There is nothing worse than sitting down in front of a candidate and they haven’t done any research on Crytek, its projects or its technological achievements. Candidates need to relax and be themselves. Try to be honest about their knowledge and experience. As experienced interviewers, we can always tell when someone doesn’t really understand a concept. It is always advisable to show us what you’re enthusiastic about and can do. By doing this it will generally assist the flow of the overall interview.\n\nIf your studio has recruited talent internationally, what was the process like for you and for the applicant?\n\nUnfortunately, until recently we have been limited in our ability to recruit internationally. This was due to restrictions in place with the UK Border Agency. However, we are now seeking talented programmers globally and are prepared to do what it takes to hire the right candidates. We will ensure the process is as smooth as can be offering both financial and logistical support.\n\nTo read our other Recruiter Hot Seat articles about studios looking to hire, visit our archive."
