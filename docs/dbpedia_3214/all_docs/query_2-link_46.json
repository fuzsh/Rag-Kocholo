        "text": "Crytek is delighted to announce that Hunt: Showdown players can set their sights on a range of new experiences and challenges as a new map called DeSalle comes to the game’s PC test servers today. DeSalle will then launch on the live servers for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One later this summer.\n\nThe new map is the first to launch for Hunt: Showdown in three years and expands the roster of Hunt: Showdown maps to three, joining Still Water Bayou and Lawson Delta as settings for the game’s high risk, high reward competitive match-based gameplay.\n\nA foreboding new autumnal theme sets the tone DeSalle, where players will hunt clues, monsters, each other and new Miner Grunt enemies who are equipped with blinding helmet lights.\n\nDeSalle features 16 distinct new areas combing the decayed urban sprawl of two Wild West towns alongside expansive mountainous, industrial and farming regions. New urban settings in the map include a prison, church, bank and a saloon. Players will also hunt and fight through a shipyard, watermill, fort, quarry, coal mine and the new farmyard areas.\n\nFans can get a preview of DeSalle’s varied environments by watching a new gameplay trailer released today.\n\n“We are delighted to launch DeSalle, a map which will bring a really new feel to the bayou,” said Fatih Özbayram, Senior Producer for Hunt: Showdown.\n\n“DeSalle is designed to bring more verticality to the game with climbable areas where players can take the high ground. The new map presents a wide range of new gameplay possibilities and more approaches for players to take towards their target, whether roaming town streets, stalking through a shipyard, or exploring the depths of a quarry.”\n\nHunt: Showdown is out now for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Players can find out more about the game by visiting www.huntshowdown.com."
