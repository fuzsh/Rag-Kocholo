        "text": "I think the problem with Crytek is that they are always behind the swing of the industry or just can't predict the trends. After the success of Crysis 1 they wanted to get in on the console gaming scene that was exploding at the time. Crysis 2 was a success on consoles, but Crysis 3 flopped because the console market didn't really like Crysis 2 and PC gamers felt burned.\n\nRyse was just a horrible idea. They should have stuck to what they are good at and created a new IP shooter as a lunch title, which probably would have done much better than Ryse. FPS with decent online always sell well in the consoles early life cycle. I just do not understand that decision to make an action game when your studio has always made FPS games.\n\nThen they switched their focus to F2P and by the time they released the game that market was way over saturated as well and nobody was interested.\n\nTo top it all off they just try to create a half assed subscription model to try to match with what Epic is doing. The difference is Epic is actually offering a service, and Crytek is not doing anything. Epic has huge updates every month or less, they are constantly putting up tutorial videos, creating example content, and documenting everything is great detail. Crytek on the other hand do not do any of that and I do not see why I would pay for that.\n\nI feel bad because I know some people that work for Crytek, but they are just completely lost in the business decisions they have been making over the years.\n\nCrytek management's culture doesn't have the same passion for gaming as Epic's does. To illustrate this you can compare Crytek's CEO to Epic's founder. Cevat seems to be in it for \"the hustle\" when u look at his business decisions. I'm not saying Sweeney isn't either, but he's one of those guys whose very life is personally invested in gaming itself as an institution, not only as a business. And you can hear this reflected in the rhetoric of the people who he's working with, and also you can see it being reflected in their business model.\n\nTo top it all off they just try to create a half assed subscription model to try to match with what Epic is doing.

Crytek on the other hand do not do any of that and I do not see why I would pay for that.\n\nI agree with you in that I feel that Crytek - or more precisely the management - seems to run after the hip things (first consoles, then F2P and as a result being late to both), but did you actually follow the subscription model since it's release? Since release Crytek has updated the engine nearly every week, they also constantly keep updating the documentation and releasing assets (or updating old ones to PBR) that you can use in your games for free. And they seem to keep their promise of more source access - the last two updates included source access for multiple systems.\n\nOf course not everything is perfect, the documentation still has areas that are lacking or are oudated, and they haven't released video tutorials like Epic, but you are exaggerating when you say Crytek does not do anything of that.\n\nSince release Crytek has updated the engine nearly every week, they also constantly keep updating the documentation and releasing assets (or updating old ones to PBR) that you can use in your games for free.

There are a lot of preview assets to check out.\n\nObviously, they still have a lot to work on; however, I feel like a lot of people hate on CryEngine just to hate on it, without actually trying to MAKE something with it. It's pretty fantastic to get some assets in engine quickly with great dynamic lighting without having to bake any light-maps.\n\nYea, I'm working on a project in CE right now and I have to say that they've done a lot since it went on Steam.

It's pretty fantastic to get some assets in engine quickly with great dynamic lighting without having to bake any light-maps.\n\nWell let me put it like this. I guess i have a Full Disclosure moment right here. lol. I don't have bad wishes on Crytek employees. But Crytek the company rubbed me the wrong way when they assured blender users that they'd add support for us but that support only materialized as a half assed static mesh importer that a member of the community made on his own without help from Crytek. So maybe I do sort of secretly hate Crytek management on some subconscious level. Cuz I was a fresh faced little game dev kiddo back then. I had all my hopes and dreams invested in them. And they led me on. It just wasn't cool.\n\nMaybe this didn't end up happening, but wasn't Crytek trying to get into the simulation industry as well? I remember a few years ago when I was working on a military simulation company there was talk about Crytek getting into that to compete with VBS2 and such.\n\nMy experience with Sims is that unless you have some kind of dedicated rig for the simulator itself, then chances are its going to need to be able to run on a pretty wide range of hardware, including a big selection of lower end machines that likely didn't have games in mind when they were acquired. They'll aim for something they can install just about anywhere, without needing new computers to go along with it. I can't see cryengine being used the same way I saw vbs and unity.\n\nClearly you aren't using CryEngine at all, right? We've seen several updates this week, with more example content and source code releases. I also don't see how the documentation is lacking, it's all there... If you think something's missing or not explained properly, please let me know so we can improve.\n\nHe is not wrong, the Cryengines knee jerk reaction to UE4s affordable subscription based policy doesn't change the ethos of cryengine and crytek at its core, the documentation has always been poor to start with, and no sub, no engine, and everyones heard the horror stories about ambiguous royalty fees.\n\nCryengine for me only had the advantage in superior lighting, to which UE4 has largely rectified, I could simply not see a reason why any person would want to use cryengine over UE4 other than being accustomed to it, hell id sooner use Unity free to make a game over cryengine, or game maker studio for that matter.\n\nMy sympathies here are with the employees who beyond clearly suffering from mismanagement didn't get PAID for the work they did, which is just unacceptable and further shows the ethos crytek carries with it.\n\n200 staff members didn't just risk their professional and financial situations over nothing, especially in this jobs market.\n\nOk let me join technically here.\n\nCurrently I am using CE and UE4 simultaneously to see their strong/weak points.\n\nThe only strong \" TECHNICAL\" point I would put CE over UE4 be... performance.\n\nWhen I just look through free example levels my PC goes F1 car engine on me, both fans goes crazy and even with that around 25 FPS in editor. To get fluid developer experience you need to \" Build\" the game. Well that takes.... 6-8 hours depending on your project.\n\nIn CE I open a 16 km square level full of... everything with great lighting and I just do whatever I wanto to do. Thyere are really times when FPS drops ( like deep fog or the like) but I can give an overall 30+ FPS. And if I want to see end result, well I can just switch to game instantly. That is all. No fuss no muss.\n\nRight now with all the rumors around and possibility to be sold at Sony, the risk of my work going to be wasted since my EaaS license won't work is too great to take a chance. I am currently trying to go indie ( that is why I am trying he both engines) and let's say... after 3 months something happened EaaS service is held, stopped, sold whatever... Then what ???\n\nAlso 150+ video tutorials for every aspect leaves no excuse for a serious developer.\n\nMan I sometimes just want to see Hideo Kojima giving green light t his Fox Engine to be released. Last September he said \" they want to polish it even more to present a better experience for developers\".\n\nIf that had come out. No brainer man... No brainer..."
