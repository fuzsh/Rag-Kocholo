I want to be a part of it - New York, New York,\" are the lyrics that would be present in this Crysis 2 launch trailer if Crytek hadn't gone for some dodgy street remix majig. Don't get us wrong, we like some urban beats. Not keen on this tune though.

Here's your first look at Crytek's long-hyped first-person shooter which is looking\n\n.. alright.
