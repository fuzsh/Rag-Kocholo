We ourselves love to play games on mobile devices and we very much look forward to bringing our production values and skills to them.”, added Nick Button-Brown, General Manager Games at Crytek.\n\nCrytek’s first mobile game stars the cute but brave and curious extraterrestrial ‘Fibble’, who crash lands in a suburban home on Earth. In the crash, Fibble becomes separated from his crew. In order for the gang to return safely to their home planet, the player needs to help Fibble find and regroup his mates, by searching the mysterious location room by room.\n\nThis endeavour is not as easy as it sounds though, and throughout the adventure, Fibble will need all the help he can get from a crowd of Mini creatures that each possess a particular skill.\n\nFor more details on Fibble – Flick ‘n’ Roll, please visit: www.fibble.com\n\nAbout Crytek\n\nCrytek GmbH (\"Crytek\") is one of the world’s leading independent development studios for interactive entertainment.
