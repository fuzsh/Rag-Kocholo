Just making games higher and higher resolution is never going to be the future, there needs to be other routes too.\"\n\nDon't worry, Crytek isn't interested in making a carnival game or equally dumb mini-game collection. \"Those types of games are not something we're going to be fixated on,\" Hilton told Develop-Online, \"but we always are interested in new control inputs. I think people would appreciate the type of games Crytek is known for if there was more than button-pressing to them.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Project Natal does not yet have a release date, but smart money puts it at fall 2010."
