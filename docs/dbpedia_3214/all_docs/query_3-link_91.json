To join in with the discussions yourself email us at\n\ngamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk.\n\nSolid GeraltI bought The Witcher 2 and so far I’m failing to see why it’s so highly rated. It’s a solid game with a relatively good script, but that’s it. Characters blithering on about politics and who’s going to invade who next doesn’t make for compelling narrative and Geralt is a dour lead (and that’s a generous term). It also seems to be a game that wants to be seen to be mature, but actually isn’t at all.The exploitative nudity (why doesn’t Geralt ever get his kit off but the women do?) and swearing is for the most part completely unnecessary. At times the visual sexualisation of the female characters also borders on parody, a drawback which frustratingly contradicts the strength of the actual characters themselves. The game also lingers far too long in each location, making you go back and forth till you can you become sick of the same pathways and landmarks – which is a shame because the designs are generally top notch, if fairly derivative. Don’t get me wrong, I am still enjoying it, and I’ll eventually replay it to explore the other branching narratives. But in terms of gameplay it does absolutely nothing new, and the so called maturity is too often undermined by masculine misogyny.Spanishcat (gamertag)PS: I’m SC on Metro, by the way.The Witcher ZeroGiven the great news that the Xbox 360 version of The Witcher 2 got to the top of the charts what do you think this means for the abandoned port of the original from a couple of years back? I’ve wanted to play it since I first heard about it in 2006 but have never had a PC that’s been up to the task.I’ve been trying to justify shelling out on a better PC for a while now, but just can’t find enough compelling reasons (or money…) so if there is any chance of it coming to consoles it would makes things a lot easier!Sparky the YakGC:That seems like a logical move, Crytek did something similar with Crysis 1. But nothing’s been annouced yet.Nothing to sayRegarding the latest Call of Duty rumour, apathy truly has set in for me. I was a big fan and a regular on the multiplayer servers, but of late my enthusiasm has waned, considerably. I read the headline about the possibility there could be no sequel to Black Ops, and it failed to register any interest. In fact I don’t know why I’m even bothering to write in about it – apologies.Up4Banter\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nPositive changeIn reply to the Crytek comment on pre-owned games. I can understand companies being against the pre-owned market but they do themselves no favours by releasing games in the middle of a Christmas rush and at £40. We also see that most of the profit-making schemes surrounding games at the moment seem to be at the expense, or to the annoyance, of the customer. Why is there such a blatant distain for us? And why do they automatically think that imposing restrictions will equal greater long term profits?Surely a positive approach to the pre-owned problem is worth a try, sensible actions that encourage more gamers to play their games. For example, I wish that just once, a company would time a release for the barren months and price it at £20. People are crying out positive changes, for pro-active consumer-friendly companies. People are willing to buy their games new but are sick of being treated so unfairly. As long as the current negative system is in place the pre-owned market is a force for good… to kill it will not go down well!Pretty soon I can see a gaming powerhouse pushing too far and collapsing and I would welcome it. I have nothing against big corporations and their profit driven nature but when it comes down to it they are just shopkeepers, and why would you buy something from a rude shopkeeper who makes you jump through hoops? Gaming will never die, people will always love games and creative types will always make them but the business side is absurd.Petch1984GC:We agree with everything you say, although we should point out that Crysis 2 was released in March.Pile of reasonsJust spent ages trying all the silly techniques to clean my Splinter Cell CD on the Xbox and finally managed to install it. All this messing around so I can access the Ghost Recon: Future Soldier beta. It made me think of the argument surrounding a digital only future. Where a disc is useless once damaged a digital copy is available forever (within reason). This to me is a highly attractive feature of digital downloads.Especially for those of you who keep your discs in piles. You know who you are.The biggest downside, is within the threat to a part of the great social side of gaming. Loving a game, convincing them to give it a go, and taking it round to their place, or a loaner to check it out. Out the window. I remember coming home on the bus reading the manuals, which were worthy of reading on a game that cost £10 max compared to today’s pamphlets. Fond memories. Now waiting for a download. Checking out the ‘Net for info. Things change.PhillyG4212Non-game reviewWill you be reviewing Colors 3D for the 3DS? I downloaded it recently and was very impressed with how easy it is to use. Being able to paint in 3D for the first time is a unique experience and well worth the fiver I paid for it. Also, you can download other people’s work for free through the gallery. There’s some really good artists on there, and me!Jedi1GC:We’re probably not going to have time, especially as it’s not a game. But you seem to have just made a pretty good pitch for it yourself.Warning lightThis Thursday morning, I clicked on the UEFA review. I did this not because I have any interest in football (you can’t be a real geek and claim to like football – a bit like that episode in IT Crowd where Roy and Moss blag about footballing knowledge), no – rather just to keep abreast of all the silly politics surrounding football sims and the tiresome arguments over which way to pretend to kick a ball is better. But this is not some bizarre rant against football. No, when I clicked on the review the little exclamation mark that appears alongside your profile name when you’ve signed into the site started blinking red. What does this mean? Was it trying to warn me? That nerds like me have no business reading such a page? Or does it mean that my Metro profile is about to die – the red, blinking light of death, as it were?DMRGC:It means the Illumanti are watching you.Possessed soulI’m starting to worry about the effects a certain role-playing game released last year that wasn’t Skyrim has had on my sanity, I traded it in for store credit last week but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s like I’m having withdrawal symptoms or something, it’s mad.I’ve started reading this games message boards obsessively in the hope I can wean myself off it and I read the official guide every morning on the toilet. I just need one more go then I’ll stop thinking about it. I can quit any time I like honest.This is a warning to all GC readers, just say no to Dark Souls kids. It’ll mess you up bad.mitchell @ darksouls anonymousDifficult weekendGameCentral has done it again. After reading many letters singing the praise of Dark Souls and its near impossibility and reading other GCers praise, I’ve purchased this gem of a game. Granted I haven’t actually started yet, it’s being kept till this weekend when stock will be in.Mainly a lot of smokes and juice will be needed. I’m really looking forward to this as a lot of games recently just haven’t kept my attention.Need tree fiddyPS: What’s the web address for the Dark Soul’s online guide.GC:There are two fan-made wikis, here and here .\n\nInbox also-ransI listed some games on eBay the other day. Some of them had online passes which I had used. It struck me that these games, no matter how mint you have kept the disc, case and manual, cannot be listed as ‘like new’ since you’ve used the online pass so it is not like it was when new.half_empty80 (PSN ID)The only reason why I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island is because the game played differently to the Super Mario games. But I totally agree with you it is one of the best entries in 2D games.Alek Kazam\n\nIn response to Steve P Willz finding a copy of Rhythm Thief – I purchased from ShopTo.Net this morning (Wednesday) and it has been dispatched already, whilst it is listed as in stock still. Grab itwhilst you can.TheSpectre N8 (gamertag)/TheSpectre_N8 (PSN ID)I found this very useful article in Pocket Gamer that gives some amazing PS Vita tips I think you will find very helpful. It includes enhancing PSP game graphics, how to use the right analogue stick with PSP/mini games by ‘mapping’ the face buttons and some useful Remote Play help. Check it out here. Big Angry Dad82 (gamertag)/FF13ACE (PSN ID)\n\nThis week’s Hot TopicThe subject for this week’s Hot Topic was inspired by readers Up4Banter and Sam, who ask not only what was your favourite console (or computer) of all time but which rivalry did you enjoy the most?What was it about your favourite games format that you enjoyed so much? What were your favourite games for it and where they exclusives? Did the hardware have any special features, such as controllers or multimedia extras, that gave it an advantage? How important was how it looked and what made you buy it/ask for it in the first place?What was the format’s great rival at the time (e.g. SNES vs. Mega Drive) and did you pick the winning side in terms of sales? How much did you get involved in that generation’s console war and did you own its rival – or later regret not having it?\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nThe small printNew Inbox updates appear twice daily, every weekday morning and afternoon.
