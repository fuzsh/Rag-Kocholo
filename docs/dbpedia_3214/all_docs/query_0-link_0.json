        "text": "Bringing a new dimension to stealth action games; Second Sight gives players control of a character endowed with incredible psychic abilities. The game offers multiple approaches to completing levels either via stealth; dramatic gunplay psychic powers or a combination of all three. The ability to psychically influence characters and remotely manipulate objects and individuals provides for a totally fresh gameplay dynamic.\n\nSecond Sight opens with John Vattic the player-controlled lead character as he awakens from a coma in a US medical facility where he has been subjected to traumatic surgery and experimentation. He doesnt know his name he cant remember his past all he knows is that his only hope for survival is to escape and unravel the mystery that has led to his imprisonment.\n\nHaunted by flashbacks which are experienced as fully playable episodes within the game and shocked by the discovery of his own psychic powers the player take"
