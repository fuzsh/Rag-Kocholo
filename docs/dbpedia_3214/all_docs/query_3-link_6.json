        "text": "For the series of games, see Crysis series.\n\nCrysis is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts. It was initially released in November 2007 exclusively for Microsoft Windows, but was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 four years later. A separate game entitled Crysis Warhead was released on September 12, 2008, and follows similar events as Crysis but from a different narrative perspective. Crysis, Crysis Warhead and a multiplayer expansion called Crysis Wars were re-released as a compilation pack titled Crysis Maximum Edition on 5 May 2009. At the time Crysis was released, and years thereafter, it has been praised for its milestones in graphical design (commensurate with high hardware requirements).\n\nGameplay\n\nAs with Crytek's previous game Far Cry, Crysis is an open-ended first-person shooter game with many ways to meet objectives.\n\nThe player controls a US Army Delta Force operator codenamed Nomad. The player's weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time, for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors. The player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military \"Nanosuit\" which draws power from the suit's energy. When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges. One of four modes can be selected: Armour deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster; Strength allows superhuman strength in hand-to-hand combat, the ability to throw objects and enemies with deadly force, much higher vertical jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil; Speed increases running and swimming speed to superhuman levels, as well as other forms of motion such as reloading weapons; and Cloak, which renders Nomad almost completely invisible and suppresses movement noise.\n\nThe suit's integral facemask has its own HUD, displaying typical data including a tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a booting readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.\n\nThe player can engage enemies in a variety of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or non-lethal tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. AI soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using signal flares to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.\n\nPlot\n\nSPOILERS BELOW\n\nCrysis Crysis levels: Contact\n\nRecovery\n\nRelic\n\nAssault\n\nOnslaught\n\nAwakening\n\nCore\n\nParadise Lost\n\nExodus\n\nAscension\n\nReckoning [Source]\n\nThe game begins in 2020 when North Korean forces led by General Kyong take control of the Lingshan Islands. A team of American civilian archaeologists, led by Dr. David Rosenthal, send out a distress call indicating that they discovered something that could change the world. Thus Raptor Team was dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them out and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under codenames); they are outfitted with Nanosuits, which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a high-altitude jump onto one of the islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because he lands on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad's suit, restoring its normal function.\n\nAs Raptor Team regroups after the jump, Aztec is killed by an unknown entity. When the team finds him, they discover that whatever killed him also killed and dismembered a nearby squad of KPA. The remaining members of Raptor Team proceed with the mission, and find the hostages' boat frozen near the coast of the island. They also get their first look at the aliens who have been attacking their team, when a flying alien machine sneaks up on them and snatches Jester, killing him shortly thereafter. The first hostage the team rescues turns out to be a CIA agent who was sent to monitor Dr. Rosenthal's work. In the jungle, Nomad finds another hostage named Badowski dead with ice shards in his back, as the KPA battle an alien machine nearby. After Nomad regroups with Prophet, Prophet is suddenly snatched by another flying machine, which flies away with him in its grasp. Shortly after, Nomad is contacted over the radio by the American military asking if he wishes to abort the mission since most of his team has been killed or missing; Nomad refuses, saying that he can still complete the mission.\n\nNomad makes his way to Dr. Rosenthal's research complex, where he has found a rare fossilized artifact predating humanity by two million years. The partially excavated artifact resembles one of the flying machines (designated \"exosuits\") that has been attacking the team. Rosenthal also references other discoveries of similar artifacts in Afghanistan and Siberia, suggesting that the Ceph, the name of the alien race and antagonists of the game series, have a global presence, and are not just confined to the island. While Rosenthal is running a scan on the artifact, it emits a powerful energy pulse that freezes Dr. Rosenthal solid. Nomad's Nanosuit is able to maintain his internal temperature, saving his life. Nomad then rendezvouses with a VTOL, after eliminating a Nanosuit-equipped four-man KPA special forces team near the landing site. He notifies his superiors about this, because the U.S. military had hoped to prevent the Koreans from acquiring Nanosuit technology.\n\nThe U.S. military then begins a full-scale invasion of the island, led by Major Strickland. As the U.S. forces continue to the main excavation site, the central mountain on the island begins to fall apart, revealing a huge Ceph structure inside, which is nearly the size of the mountain itself. Nomad enters the excavation site at the mountain's base, but is captured by Kyong's men. Kyong deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit, and Nomad watches, helpless, as Kyong shoots one of the hostages in the head and then detonates explosive charges to open the structure. An energy pulse emanates from the structure and kills Kyong's men; the pulse also reactivates Nomad's Nanosuit. Kyong is also wearing a Nanosuit and attacks Nomad, until Nomad is able to kill him. As the mountain continues to collapse, a VTOL evacuates the last hostage, who is Dr. Rosenthal's daughter Helena, but is unable to rescue Nomad.\n\nNomad is trapped and decides to continue into the alien structure. Shortly after entering, the environment becomes zero-gravity. Nomad uses his hydro-thrusters to maneuver and encounters hostile sentient Ceph. He also sees a possible invasion force consisting of many Ceph machines. Nomad manages to escape, but the structure creates a massive sphere of energy that freezes everything outside to -200Â°. Once outside, Nomad is attacked by various Ceph machines before finding Prophet. Prophet was able to engineer a weapon using the Ceph's technology, the Molecular Accelerator (MOAC). Prophet's Nanosuit is malfunctioning, and he frequently has to stop and recharge it using heat sources, such as the burning wrecks of military vehicles. The two leave the ice sphere and rescue Helena, whose VTOL crashed. Prophet leaves with Helena on another VTOL. At the U.S. evacuation point, one of the last VTOLs rescues Nomad from an unstoppable quadrupedal Ceph exosuit, which kills Major Strickland. As they leave the island, the VTOL's pilot is killed and Nomad must fly back to the USS Constitution carrier strike group, fighting off the Ceph along the way.\n\nOnce there, he is debriefed by Admiral Richard Morrison who explains that a nuclear strike has been ordered against the ice sphere. Helena warns him that the Ceph might absorb the energy, but the Admiral ignores her. Prophet flies a VTOL back to the island against orders. Despite Prophet's departure, the nuclear missile is launched at the ice sphere. The explosion causes the ice sphere to expand and prompts a massive Ceph counterattack.\n\nNomad is ordered to repair one of the carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is resistant to high levels of radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several Ceph machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights a Ceph exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive Ceph warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the Ceph warship, which falls on the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier into the waiting VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another Carrier Strike Group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the Ceph, they need to continue fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and heading back to the island.\n\nParallel to Crysis Warhead\n\nRunning parallel to this game is Crysis Warhead. It primarily centers on Psycho capturing a nuclear materials container which contains an alien (although it is disabled and did not self-destruct). Most of the game centers around attempting to capture this crate and bring it out of the island. It changes hands many times between Psycho & Colonel Lee (KPA) throughout the game until, finally, at the end, Psycho & Sean 'O' Neill bring it off the island on a VTOL seemingly without pursuit.\n\nLength\n\nThe entire single player campaign/story for Crysis lasts roughly 10â12 hours and the stand-alone expansion Crysis Warhead lasts 8â10 hours depending on the player's skill level/difficulty. Crytek say that the game will be very replayable and will give the player the tools they need to be very creative with the way they choose to play. However, some people criticize the campaign to be somewhat short comparing to other games. The campaign was rumored to have been shortened by Crytek so that the rest could be fit into the trilogy.\n\nSpecial Edition\n\nThe Special Edition version contains:\n\nSteelbook casing (Only for international versions)\n\nStandard Crysis PC DVD\n\nBonus DVD, including the \"Making Of\" and \"Meet The Developers\" features\n\nSeveral unique trailers\n\nA Crysis concept video\n\nDozens of artwork and storyboards\n\nDownloadable high-resolution screenshots\n\nThe usual game manual\n\nAn artbook\n\nThe Crysis soundtrack\n\nExclusive access to the Amphibious APC (unavailable to most pre-orders and Special Edition users and EA's working on a solution)\n\nSandbox Editor\n\nCrysis contains its own Sandbox Editor, much like Far Cry, in which you can edit and create new levels. Such levels have full support in all multiplayer modes. This allows the player to easily build their own levels and spawn with themselves inside to test it whenever they want.\n\nTechnical info\n\nMain article: Technical info\n\nCrysis uses an all-new engine that is the successor to Far Cry's CryENGINE.\n\nConsole Release\n\nOn October 4, 2011, Crysis was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. The game plays the same as the original with several modifications and tweaks:\n\nSpeed and strength mode combined, and serving as the default mode, with armor mode having to be manually activated. Similar to Crysis 2.\n\nManual save feature as well as archived checkpoints removed. Only the most recent checkpoint is saved.\n\nAbsence of the level Ascension\n\nNewer, brighter and slightly improved graphics (ex. the intro cutscene now reveals the whole structure of the alien mountain)\n\nLess foliage and engine tweaks due to the consoles not having enough RAM to run the full game\n\nReduced enemy A.I.\n\nLaser sights removed from enemy weapons.\n\nEnemy Korean nanosuit soldiers are now immune to tranquilizer darts.\n\nAdjustments to the A.I. in the General Kyong boss fight. Kyong can now jump between the upper and lower levels of the arena, and will use cloak mode to \"teleport\" periodically during the fight.\n\nThe player can now pull out grenades like a weapon instead of only being able to throw them\n\nUses CryENGINE 3 instead of the older CryENGINE 2.\n\nMore realistic effects from Crysis 2\n\nNew sound effects, which are mostly from Crysis 2\n\nCheckpoints are spread out and the quick save option is removed\n\nLack of multiplayer\n\nThe game still received positive reviews. Many critics praised the graphics and tweaks made to the game, but criticized several of the faults that were in the original Crysis that still appears (such as A.I. not reacting properly several times), the predictable ending and the checkpoints being spread out too far.\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, Crysis was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. The game was awarded a 98% in the PC Gamer U.S. Holiday 2007 issue, making it one of the highest rated games ever in PC Gamer, tying with Half-Life 2 and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. The UK edition of the magazine awarded the game 92%, describing the game as \"A spectacular and beautiful sci-fi epic.\" GameSpot awarded Crysis a score of 9.5 out of 10, describing it as \"easily one of the greatest shooters ever made.\" GameSpy gave it a 4.5 out of 5 stating that the suit powers were fun but also criticizing the multiplayer portion of the game for not having a team deathmatch. X-Play gave it a 3 out of 5 on its \"Holiday Buyer's Guide\" special episode, praising the graphics and physics, but criticized the steep hardware requirements as well as stating that the game is overhyped with average gameplay. GamePro honored Crysis with a score of 4.75 out of 5, saying it was \"a great step forward for PC gaming,\" but criticized the steep hardware requirements. IGN awarded it a 9.4 out of 10, hailing it as \"one of the more entertaining ballistic showdowns in quite some time.\" A retrospective review for bit-tech.net in June 2010 criticized the game for failing to deliver on its pre-release promise, saying that the art direction was \"boring and monotonous,\" that the Nanosuit was underwhelming and that the plot could be summarized as \"Rescue these people who look to be being held captive by Koreans. Oh no Aliens!\" The review concluded by saying, \"Crysis was the epitome of style over substance.\"\n\nAwards\n\nGameSpot awarded Crysis \"Best Shooter\" in its \"Best of 2007\" awards, saying that \"It was this open-ended, emergent gameplay--the ability to let us tackle our challenges in whatever way we wished.\" They also awarded it with \"Best Graphics: Technical\" and \"Best PC Game\" stating that \"The firefights in the game are beautiful to look at, but extremely intense affairs that force you to think quickly--and reward you for doing so. It's a dynamic game, one that you can play several times to discover new things and to experiment with different approaches.\"\n\nPC Gamer awarded Crysis its \"Game of the Year\" and \"Action Game of the Year\" in its March 2008, \"Games of the Year Awards\" issue. PC Gamer also remarked that \"Crysis has pushed PC gaming to a new plateau, marrying the most advanced graphics engine ever created with phenomenal gameplay. From the cinematic opening to credits to its cliffhanger ending, Crysis is mesmerizing.\"\n\nGamereactor gave Crysis a perfect ten, and awarded it with its \"Best Action Game of 2007\", saying that \"the action genre is forever changed.\"\n\nIGN awarded Crysis its \"Editor's Choice Award\", saying that \"the Halo 2-type ending... wasn't enough to deter me from heartily recommending action fans pick this one up.\"\n\nSystem requirements\n\nGallery"
