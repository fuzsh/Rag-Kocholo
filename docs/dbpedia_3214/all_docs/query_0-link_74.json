        "text": "Homefront: The Revolution is locked in to hit shelves next month, and from my hour of hands-on time, it’s actually shaping up to be a sleeper hit. While my freelance peer John Robertson wasn’t a fan after his time with the game, I have to respectfully disagree with his take on Homefront: The Revolution and feel it’s worth highlighting why it’s worth keeping an eye on. In no particular order, here’s 8 reasons why Homefront: The Revolution is shaping up to be more than a competent shooter.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIt’s not Homefront 2\n\nThere’s a reason why it’s subtitled ‘The Revolution’ and not slapped with the number ‘2’ as a title suffix. Homefront: The Revolution isn’t a sequel, and it’s not a prequel. In fact, when chatting with Dambuster Studios producer David Stenton, he confirmed that the only thing taken from the original Homefront game is the premise: North Korea invading North America. In other words, The Revolution is a reboot. Despite borrowing the premise, the fictionalised backstory of how the North Korean invasion comes to be is both reimagined and more compelling than the Red Dawn-style approach to the original game.\n\nNew developer, old pedigree\n\nYou might not have heard of any games developed by Dambuster Studios, but that’s because it’s a rebranded developer in light of the sale of the Homefront IP from Crytek to Koch Media.\n\nThis seemingly new developer has some excellent shooter pedigree, in both open-world and cooperative spaces.\n\n“\n\nBefore the rebranding, Dambuster Studios was known as Crytek UK, where it worked on multiplayer for Crysis 2 and Crysis 3. Before that, Crytek UK was called Free Radical, the dev that made the insanely popular Time Splitters series. As Free Radical, the developer also worked on Star Wars Battlefront III, which was reportedly cancelled when it was 99% complete. If you’re a Star Wars fan, particularly one disappointed by DICE’s Battlefront reboot, you should definitely check out what could have been with Battlefront III. The whole point of this is to say that this seemingly new developer has some excellent shooter pedigree, in both open-world and cooperative spaces.\n\nIt’s a thinking-gamer’s shooter\n\nShooters have seemingly returned to a space where they separate into old-school run-and-gun titles, or methodical slow-paced affairs. Homefront: The Revolution strikes a middle path. While playing fully aggressively with little care for health is a fast way to revisit the respawn screen, careful stealthy planning can fall apart at a moment’s notice, which means the gameplay descends into frantic shootouts. The intention is to shift away from the thinly veiled corridor-shooting Call of Duty-lite antics of the last Homefront game and into more of an open-approach combat environment. Like Far Cry, planning an incursion on an enemy base is part of the fun, but having the option to go loud when an enemy patrol unexpectedly rounds the corner is also a blast.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWeapon modding on the fly is awesome\n\nThe Revolution lifts the dynamic weapon modification system of the Crysis series, but evolves it to the next logical level. Instead of being limited to changing scopes or attachments, players can modify their weapons on the fly into completely different firearms. The starting pistol, for instance, can be converted to a submachine gun, while the assault rifle can be transformed into a devastating light machine gun. Rest assured you can still unlock and change the scopes, grips and add attachments such as silencers to modify your tactical options, but the more dramatic modifications mean the initially limited two-weapon restriction opens up gameplay possibilities in a big way.\n\nIt’s part Assassin’s Creed, part Far Cry\n\nThese days, it’s impossible to make an open-world game without it being thrown into an elevator-style ‘X game meets Y title’ pitch. To continue the trend, The Revolution is part Assassin’s Creed and part Far Cry. Sure, those are both open-world action titles (the latter more than the former), but the Assassin’s Creed comparison relates more to the stealth and hiding in plain sight. During the second half hour of my preview, I was fast-forwarded to later in the game, where the patrolling KPA soldiers knew my face and would react to my presence. This meant I had to hide out in the open if I didn’t want to be seen, using civilians as line-of-sight blockers as I shifted through the heavily patrolled streets.\n\nOf course, when that came unstuck, I went full Far Cry on them, making use of hit-and-run tactics against waves of reinforcements in open-approach combat scenarios. Alternatively, if you have issues avoiding your dogged pursuers, you can embrace another Assassin’s Creed trope and hide in optional spots to make avoiding KPA hunters a whole lot easier.\n\nThere’s an emphasis on verticality\n\nWhile fellow open-world shooter Far Cry certainly has moments of verticality, Homefront: The Revolution embraces verticality as an inherent part of its level design. Because it’s set inside a Philadelphia of tomorrow, The Revolution has a strong emphasis on urban combat. When fighting inside and around buildings, embracing combat possibilities along the vertical z-axis results in new combat possibilities. Unlike Far Cry, which tends to restrict climbing to fixed points, I was able to scale buildings in Homefront in a variety of logical places to avoid pursuers, open up new lines of sight, or to solve environmental puzzles. It forces the player to conceptualise the battlefield in 3D and opens up new inroads to offensive possibilities or escape potentiality.\n\nYou have to loot to live\n\nEarly on in the game (especially), looting is crucial to being able to fight back. During my first fight, even though I was conserving ammunition, I ran out of lead in the middle of the firefight. In order to maintain combat effectiveness, players have to not only loot buildings, but also enemy combatants, and sometimes during shootouts once ammo is exhausted. To encourage on-the-fly looting, Dambuster has included a multi-tier cadaver-looting system, which grants a bit of ammo at first, and then more ammunition and items if the body is fully looted. It’s a neat mechanic that boosts the overall immersion of fighting as an underdog guerrilla in occupied territory, and makes body looting during shootouts both viable and essential to survival.\n\nIt’s poised to have a cracker story\n\nToo often in open-world games, developers struggle to find the middle ground between emergent narrative, those moment-to-moment ‘stories’ that players encounter by playing the game, and embedded narrative, which basically boils down to the main storyline. From what I experienced of The Revolution, from the intro and opening scenes to the later bits of gameplay and Stenton’s hints about the exploration of the morality of guerrilla warfare, Homefront is set to tell an engaging story. This is particularly important for the Homefront legacy given that the storyline and, in particular, some harder-hitting moments of brutality were among the better features of the first game. Fingers crossed Dambuster can effectively weave the same types of jaw-dropping moments into this reboot.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhether Roberton’s criticisms prove to be indicative of the final product, or my impressed (and hopeful) view of what I played persists for the entirety of the campaign is yet to be seen. Either way, you’ll be able to read the official IGN review next month and play the game for yourself when it launches in North America on the 17th of May and in the rest of the world on the 20th of May.
