        "text": "Frankfurt\n\nGermany\n\nFrankfurt is Crytek’s HQ and the home base for the CRYENGINE and Hunt teams. Located in a bright, open office in Frankfurt’s east end, the Frankfurt studio has a team of 250+ people from 35 countries.\n\nIstanbul\n\nTurkey\n\nThe Istanbul studio serves with a multi-national and growing team located in the most-known plaza in İstanbul's business center Şişli with a great Bosphorus view, that is also ideally located for variable public transportation ways such as metro, metrobus and bus lines.\n\nKiev\n\nUkraine\n\nThe Kiev studio is focused on game and web development, in their modern, centrally located office.\n\nEnvision.\n\nAt Crytek, we aim to push the boundaries of what is considered possible—both in our games and in our technology. That creative vision drives us, and our projects, and we know that inspiration can come from the most unlikely of places. Ideas and feedback are always welcome—at every level.\n\nEmpower.\n\nWe know that the way we support and empower our teams will ultimately make or break our games, and we believe that every one of our employees has an impact on the company’s success. We trust that our employees are talented and capable, and that with a sense of purpose, responsibility, and the proper tools and support we can achieve great things together.\n\nAchieve.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to deliver products that make us feel proud to have been there and been a part of it. But once we’ve achieved that, we won’t stop—we want to do it again, and better. So we want to build teams that feel inspired, challenged, and motivated by their work—not only does that make it fun to come to work every morning, it produces truly inspired results."
