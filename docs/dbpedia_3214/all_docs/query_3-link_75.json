        "text": "The earliest video games were developed in universities in the 1950s. Gaming is a serious business. Even though it has been one of the biggest hobbies sustained since its creation, many gamers have made a livelihood from playing video games.\n\nFrom “Pac-Man” to “Call of Duty,” from Atari to PlayStation, the digital realm of video games is celebrated on July 8th. Why it is good to have these extra activities in your office space:\n\nFaster Decision Making- Playing video games is a good way to make employees feel more sure of the decisions they’re making. After all, when you’re engaged in a game you’re forced to react quickly and efficiently without assistance!\n\nIncreased Productivity- You can get through that little hurdle with a good video game break.\n\nBetter Memory- Researchers from the University of California, Irvine had 69 participants play Super Mario 3D World every day for 2 weeks. The gamers were then tasked with completing follow-up memory tests. Surprisingly, the employees ended up doing a lot better on these memory tests than they did before playing the game.\n\nLess Stress- Do you have an employee that needs a few minutes to simmer down after completing a taxing project? Ask them to fire up their favorite console and play!\n\nImproved Communication- Sometimes it’s simple as plugging in a few video game controllers and letting loose!\n\nAll of the above is tested and confirmed from our colleagues, and video game routine is part from our company since day one.\n\n‘’The first game I encountered in my life is Pong on Atari back in 1991, since then I am hooked on video games and I’ve played almost all popular arcade and pc game out there... I have tons of favorites, but what left the biggest impressions on me are from the arcade side; Bad Dudes Vs. Dragon Ninja, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Pang, Street Fighter, Bubble Bobble and from pc; Prince of Persia, Quake, Star Craft, Half Life, Unreal, Age Of Empires, Delta Force, Red Alert, Need For Speed, Resident Evil, Empire Earth, Medal Of Honor, Call Of Duty, Sudden Strike, Strong Hold, Grand Theft Auto, Far Cry, but from all games in my life, I have spent the most time on World Of Warcraft and PUBG so I can freely say that those two are my most favorite games... What I like about gaming: community and socialization, adventures, skill demanding, logic and fast thinking testing... I am a bad looser and I play to win.’’\n\nAlex\n\n‘’My favorite video game is World of Warcraft. I love every aspect and the overall setting of the game from the side of Lore, Stories, Creatures and Races to the role-playing and challenging features that the game play offers to you. It’s so fun to play with friends and communities.''\n\nPetar\n\n‘’My favorite PC game I ever played was Crysis. Crysis is an action first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek, published by Electronic Arts.When I was a student I completed Crysis 1 and Crysis 2. Crysis 2 was a game with power full realistic graphics for that time (2011).’’\n\nGoce"
