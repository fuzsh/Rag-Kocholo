        "text": "The morning Inbox wonders what Sony’s replacement for Uncharted 4 will be, as one reader laments Free Radical’s bad luck.\n\nTo join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nGeneration’s end\n\nHas GC heard the rumour that Mortal Kombat X might be delayed until June on last gen consoles? I don’t know if it’s true or not but it’s actually made me stop and think about whether I actually want to buy the game on my Xbox 360 or not. I wasn’t planning to get a next gen console until this Christmas (haven’t decided which one yet) but now I’m thinking I don’t want to be playing rushed, clearly inferior ports for the next six months.\n\nWhich basically means either I buy the console early or I just wait and do without. How long do you think companies will continue to make last gen games? Am I basically just going to have to bit the bullet for this Christmas if I want to be playing anything new? It’s a difficult choice because I doubt Mortal Kombat X is really pushing any console but I don’t want to be getting a poor man’s knock-off version.\n\nStreetwise\n\nGC: We heard the rumours but there didn’t seem to be much substance behind them, even if the news wouldn’t surprise us. We wouldn’t expect many more last gen games to be released after the first half this year. We’d guess FIFA 16 and perhaps Call Of Duty would probably be it for the major titles.\n\nUnlucky developer\n\nIf I was a publisher I wouldn’t want to have anything to do with Free Radical Design/Crytek UK/Deep Silver whatever. Not because they’re not any good but because the whole company is obviously jinked! I can’t believe the terrible luck they’ve head since day one. Even if you put TimeSplitters not really taking off to bad marketing no publisher has ever been good to them.\n\nCodemasters buried Second Sight, god knows what happened with Ubisoft and Haze, then Crytek bought them and just wasted them on the multiplayer for Crysis. Like that’s all they did for five years. And now there’s Homefront: The Revolution and its three different publishers.\n\nOf course I’m missing out the worst of them: Star Wars: Battlefront III. I still can’t believe the way LucasArts acted with that game and how good it looked at the time. If the new one from DICE doesn’t have the same transitions from ground to space then there is going to be a riot. At least in my house.\n\nTonto12\n\nPlan B\n\nSo obviously Sony need a new exclusive for Christmas now but what is it actually going to be? There’s nothing they’ve announced so far that I think really fits the bill and wouldn’t it be really weird if they announced a major game just four or five months before it was actually released?\n\nI wonder if this is going to end up being a bigger mess up than people first realised. Sure giving Naughty Dog plenty of time to perfect Uncharted 4 seems like a good thing, but there seems to be literally nothing to replace it. Maybe Sony will end up just paying to make Metal Gear Sold V an exclusive?\n\nDRON3\n\nGC: It would certainly be unusual, but Sony (and Microsoft for that matter) are behind with their exclusive announcements, as it were, and there certainly seems to be the capacity for at least one major game to be almost finished and yet not even announced yet. Santa Monica Studio, for example, still haven’t released a major game, despite rumours they’re working on a new God Of War.\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nInteractive movies\n\nAnother serious good interview GC, this time with Sid Meier. I love the contrast with how you treat developers and execs, one of which deserves our respect and one our deep suspicion. Sid actually came across really nice too, how was he? And how did you get him to agree to such a long interview? I liked his long thoughtful answers and he clearly wasn’t there only to promote his game (but where’s your review?).\n\nI think the stuff you were saying about older games have more ambition and Sid’s point about what in movies inspired him were very interesting. And particularly relevant at the start of a generation and with stuff like The Order: 1886 basically dragging us back to interactive movie territory once again.\n\nIt’s not like everything has to be a flight sim or strategy game to be good but I wish other younger developers would take Sid’s advice about trying to make things fun first and foremost, not caring about realism, and actually designing your games – not just throwing a bunch of pretty graphics together. I’d love to know what Ready at Dawn would think reading the interview, would they just say, ‘That old geezer doesn’t no what he’s talking about, it’s the cut scenes that are the most important thing!’\n\nPurple Ranger\n\nGC: Thanks. Sid was really nice, a real pleasure to talk to. The long interview wasn’t our idea though, the PR department just asked if we wanted an hour and a half interview with him and we said yes! Oddly they then failed to send over the review code for Starships until the last minute, but hopefully we’ll have something up for Monday morning.\n\nBehind the stars\n\nThe BBC GTA programme sounds interesting and I’ll certainly give it a watch. However, what I would really like from Rockstar is a proper official ‘making of’ documentary. Even a book.\n\nSomething along the lines of the best DVD making ofs for Alien, Lord Of The Rings, etc. They must have stacks of material, from all the research they do, planning meetings, budgets, marketing, casting, design, the list goes on.\n\nIt could be a truly fascinating insight into how these things take shape.\n\nRolph\n\nExpensive advertising\n\nEnjoyed the Ori And The Blind Forest review and agree with the previous reader who said they could imagine a future where they buy almost exclusively indie games, and don’t even bother with blockbusters any more. I wonder how much this is going to change too as we move into the digital downloads being the usual way that most people buy their games. Because at that point there’ll be no difference between an indie game and any other: other than they’re cheaper and better.\n\nThe biggest issue as far as I can see is actual advertising on the online stores. The PSN and Xbox Live front ends seem to have some very odd priorities in terms of what they show, which I assume is either due to drunkenness or publishers buying the prominent slots. Or a combination of both.\n\nThe biggest problem for indie games has always been visibility and since they can’t afford to pay Microsoft and Sony I can see them just getting pushed to the back, the equivalent of being in a dusty corner of a shop with bad lighting. Hopefully that’s not what happens.\n\nGaldron\n\nSafety conscious shooter\n\nJust wanted to say what a great little game Helldivers is. Hadn’t really heard of it until your review but since I like dual stick shooters and have a good friend that does to I managed to talk him into a purchase and we’ve both been having a lot of fun. The whole galactic war thing is a really cool idea and I like the idea of the supply drops and everything, it adds a lot of tension.\n\nI’ve seen some people complain about the friendly fire not being ‘fair’ (how can it not be fair not to have magic bullets that don’t injure someone standing right in front of you?) but to me this is the best bit. Ducking to avoid bullets and having to worry about where you team-mates are as you let rip adds a real extra edge to it. It’s convinced me it should be an option in more games, as it really makes you think more about other people’s safety as well as yours.\n\nKraven\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nWait until you’re sure\n\nWow, these delays are getting crazy now, aren’t they? I still don’t even know why there is a Homefront 2, but just having day after day of delays is getting embarrassing. I do agree with GC’s rant to Jim Ryan that the games industry in general is still very unprofessional and it leaves itself open to another big company, like Apple, swooping in and showing them how it’s done.\n\nIt’s such a simple thing too. If they don’t know when a game is going to be finished don’t give it a date! Nobody would’ve cared if they hadn’t given an Uncharted 4 a release date. Why didn’t they just wait till E3 when they announce their other big games and then could’ve seen then which ones were actually ready or not.\n\nI dunno, sometimes publishers just seem to be looking for trouble, continually falling into traps that they set-up for themselves. I don’t think long-term planning is really what they’re good at.\n\nJackob\n\nInbox also-rans\n\nAny adult players of Animal Crossing: New Leaf around? I’m absolutely loving picking up and playing the game as a stress relief after a hard day’s work! My friend code is 0791-4315-4833. I’m online weekdays at 8! Post your friend codes if you fancy popping over!\n\nPaul\n\nPS: Keep up the great work, GC!\n\nJust wanted to offer my thanks to yourselves and those readers who replied regarding my upcoming trip to Japan. It was much appreciated and I now have a packed schedule to look forward to. Many thanks once again.\n\nDuckOfDeath82 (PSN ID)\n\nGC: In return you can take some pics and write us a Reader’s Feature about how you get on there.\n\nJust a quick message to say that the Bedrooms to Billions: the Amiga Years Kickstarter has met its £50,000 goal to get made. You can still back it though as it has 16 days left.\n\nAndrew J.\n\nGC: Here’s the page for those that are interested.\n\nThis week’s Hot Topic\n\nThe subject for this weekend’s Hot Topic was suggested by reader DMR, who challenges you to make up your own Achievements and Trophies for your favourite games.\n\nAchievements are a standard part of most modern video games but they’re not always created with a great deal of imagination or thought. So we want to know what accomplishments you’ve achieved in games that you’re upset you didn’t get any acknowledgement for. You can name any game, modern or retro, and as many achievements as you like.\n\nDo you generally care about achievements and what do you think makes a good or bad one? Which are your favourite and least favourite ones, and which are you most proud of getting?\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nThe small print\n\nNew Inbox updates appear twice daily, every weekday morning and afternoon. Letters are used on merit and may be edited for length.\n\nYou can also submit your own 500 to 600-word 4Player viewer features at any time, which if used will be shown in the next available weekend slot.\n\nIf you need quick access to the GameCentral channel page please use www.metro.co.uk/games and don’t forget to follow us on Twitter."
