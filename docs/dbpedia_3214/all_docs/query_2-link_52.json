        "text": "Crytek likes to push boundaries. Whether its producing games so technologically demanding that PCs can barely run them on release (looking at you, Crysis) or aiding other developers' creations with its high-spec CryEngine, the company has become synonymous with high-spec gaming.\n\nThe next frontier to be explored is virtual, with the latest iteration of CryEngine expanding to support high-res VR. WIRED.co.uk speaks with Crytek creative director Frank Vitz to discuss the big push, how CryEngine could be adopted for non-gaming productions, and its own experiments in virtual reality.\n\n**WIRED.co.uk: What is Crytek's goal for VR as a platform?**Frank Vitz: We're making a big push into VR. One of our underlying strategies is for CryEngine to be a transmedia engine, that can support enterprises in video games and virtual reality, across a wide range of different types of applications. What we're doing here is trying to prove the technology out.\n\nWe have a couple of goals. Because CryEngine is a licensed product that people can buy, one of my goals is to have support for VR integrated into the engine so that our licensees have access to it to develop their own titles. The best way to do that is to lead by example, so we're doing technical exploration.\n\n**How close are you to having final, release-worthy products from your internal efforts?**There was Back to Dinosaur Island 1, and now we're on the second version of that, both of which can be seen as experimentation but they've also lead us to some really cool ideas for IP. That's why we announced Robinson: The Journey at E3. [Beyond experiments], the next step is the narrative, developing the storylines and all that. [Even Dino Island 2] is very serious -- production quality assets but in a limited context to explore what it feels like to move in the world.\n\n**Given you're producing an engine rather than any VR hardware of your own, how are you looking to provide crossplatform support for the various VR standards?**Oculus was the first -- we got early access to the devices and so we have a native integration of the Oculus SDK in the engine now, which we released in our latest build. We're now working with HTC Vive, so we'll have that as well, and we're talking with the guys at OSVR just to get it on to our support schedule.\n\nAs an engine, our goal is to be hardware agnostic, so we can support any device. Obviously, that's driven by the needs of either a game we might be producing ourself, because we build the engine so we can use it, but also possibly by other customers, whatever they're clamouring for. We have PS4 support, with some indie developers, so it's a natural that we've got the Morpheus in-house now. I think it's going to take a while for each of those devices to be as tightly integrated as we've already got with the Oculus, but that's our goal.\n\n**Do you have any expectations of growth for VR as a medium?**There's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of hype, but there are also a lot of very smart people who are betting big on it right now. The most obvious one is Facebook, and in my opinion, that was as much a mark in the sand of what they believe the importance of VR is going to be, as much as it was an indication of the value of Oculus at the time.\n\n**Do you see CryEngine as having applications in virtual reality aside from games?**Absolutely. I believe, and we believe as a company, that VR is actually sort of at the convergence between video games and films. The same technology that drives games is being used more in digital video effects, and VR is not really one thing. On a tech level or experiential level, it's a spectrum.\n\nAt one end, you're going to have completely interactive world experiences that are just like a video game, where you can move around the environments in VR. You can also have scripted, guided experiences running in the game engine. Then you move towards something where you might pre-render a 360Â° field of view [for a] linear experience, and it starts to become more like a movie. CryEngine can power things like that too, where you create a guided experience, where you can still look around, but the sequence that you see has been pre-formulated.\n\nThen you get all the way to an actual movie, where everything about it is scripted, but still your experience can differ depending on where you're looking. That's where people in the film industry see those kinds of linear experiences appealing to them, because they're more comfortable with the idea, as directors, of creating content that's scripted. We're working with partners in that field -- we have some potential projects underway, and we have technology that's going to support those kinds of applications, but we can't talk about the specifics yet.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
