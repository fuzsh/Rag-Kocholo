        "text": "The makers of the Crysis video games series have announced they are opening a new studio in China.\n\nGerman developer Crytek said its Shanghai base would work on local uses of CryEngine - the software that powers games' graphics and provides artificial intelligence to their characters.\n\nIt said its team would develop new technical features relevant to Asian gamers and aid local-language support.\n\nChina has a huge video games markets which is still growing rapidly.\n\nCrytek's news is the latest in a series of China-focused gaming developments.\n\nThe firm teamed up with local publisher Tencent - China's biggest internet company - at the end of 2010.\n\nThey offer the online free-to-play title Warface, a CryEngine-based first person shooter.\n\nTencent also has links to several other western gaming giants.\n\nActivision is working with the company on an upcoming China-specific release of its flagship war game: Call of Duty Online.\n\nDespite the fact that many video games consoles are built in mainland China, they have been officially banned for sale there since the year 2000.\n\nAs a result developers have focused on selling titles for PCs or mobile devices.\n\nThe market is huge: analysts at Niko Partners recently told Forbes, external that the country was home to 150 million gamers who collectively generated half of the world's PC online games revenue.\n\nIt estimated the market would be worth $6.1bn this year saying Tencent was the leader when it came to advanced casual titles.\n\nOthers are also closely monitoring developments.\n\n\"There are other big gaming companies doing business in the territory including Shanda and Netease,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Screen Digest.\n\n\"But the advantage of working with Tencent is that it has the biggest amount of users. That's thanks to products such as its QQ instant messaging service with over 700 million users, which gives it huge marketing clout.\n\n\"From Tencent's point of view it wants to build relationships that will help its products stand out, and that's why it's seeking partnerships with the companies offering the highest quality content in this space.\""
