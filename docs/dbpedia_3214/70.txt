Association with FRD[]

Following the bankruptcy of Free Radical Design in 2008, the company's assets were bought by Crytek for Â£50 million and the studio was rechristened "Crytek UK". The British division of Crytek moved into spacious offices at Nottingham Southreef, where they helped develop several games for Crytek.

They were responsible for developing the multiplayer of Crysis 2 and also had a hand in the development of Crysis 3. The studio developed Homefront 2 (in CryEngine 3), which became a Crytek-owned IP following the bankruptcy of publisher THQ.
