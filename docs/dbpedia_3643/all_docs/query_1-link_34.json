The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb12 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMFallSpringNov 16:48 AMNov 16:48 AMNov 152:29 PMNov 152:29 PMNov 3011:22 PMNov 3011:22 PMDec 152:02 AMDec 152:02 AMDec 303:28 PMDec 303:28 PMJan 133:28 PMJan 133:28 PMJan 295:37 AMJan 295:37 AMFeb 126:54 AMFeb 126:54 AMFeb 275:45 PMFeb 275:45 PMMar 1412:55 AMMar 1412:55 AMMar 294:58 AMMar 294:58 AM8:13 AM8:13 AM6:32 PM6:32 PM7:09 AM7:09 AM4:40 PM4:40 PM4:29 PM4:29 PM8:23 AM8:23 AM8:00 AM8:00 AM5:06 PM5:06 PM5:25 PM5:25 PM8:43 AM8:43 AM8:06 AM8:06 AM6:18 PM6:18 PM5:26 PM5:26 PM7:45 AM7:45 AM6:22 PM6:22 PM7:23 PM7:23 PM7:58 AM7:58 AM8:39 PM8:39 PM\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Enterprise is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringJan 150%Jan 150%Dec 10%Dec 10%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%drydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Enterprise is essentially constant during the winter, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 9.5 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 10, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.5 miles per hour, while on August 5, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.6 miles per hour.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb0 mph0 mph5 mph5 mph10 mph10 mph15 mph15 mphFallSpringDec 19.2 mphDec 19.2 mphFeb 289.7 mphFeb 289.7 mphJan 19.6 mphJan 19.6 mphFeb 19.6 mphFeb 19.6 mph\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Enterprise throughout the winter is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 49% on January 21.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in EnterpriseNSDecJanFeb0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringsouthnortheastwest\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Enterprise typically lasts for 5.6 months (171 days), from around April 29 to around October 17, rarely starting before April 9 or after May 17, and rarely ending before September 28 or after November 6.\n\nThe winter in Enterprise is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FallSpring0%Jan 150%Jan 15Nov 610%Nov 610%frigidfreezingvery coldcoldcoolcomfortable\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Enterprise are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 3,427Â°F, from 3,443Â°F to 17Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb0Â°F0Â°F500Â°F500Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,500Â°F1,500Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,500Â°F2,500Â°F3,000Â°F3,000Â°F3,500Â°F3,500Â°FFallSpringDec 13,443Â°FDec 13,443Â°FFeb 2817Â°FFeb 2817Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Enterprise is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.6 kWh, from 2.9 kWh to 4.5 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 2.7 kWh on December 21.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Enterprise\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in EnterpriseDecJanFeb0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWhFallSpringDec 212.7 kWhDec 212.7 kWhDec 12.9 kWhDec 12.9 kWhFeb 284.5 kWhFeb 284.5 kWhFeb 13.5 kWhFeb 13.5 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Enterprise are 37.574 deg latitude, -113.719 deg longitude, and 5,315 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Enterprise contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 545 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 5,415 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,615 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (9,544 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Enterprise is covered by shrubs (74%) and cropland (23%), within 10 miles by shrubs (75%) and trees (12%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (77%) and trees (18%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Enterprise, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Enterprise.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Enterprise according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Enterprise is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Enterprise and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSaint George Municipal Airport (KSGU, 34%, 33 mi, south, -2,382 ft elevation change)\n\nCedar City Regional Airport (KCDC, 66%, 35 mi, east, 269 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Enterprise and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
