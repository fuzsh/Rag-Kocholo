        "text": "UHQ Volume 1 Number 1\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nINDIAN NAMES IN UTAH GEOGRAPHY\n\nBy Wm. R. Palmer\n\nIf one examines the map of the great inland empire commonly spoken of as \"The Inter-Mountain West,\" remembering that this region, not so long ago, was wholly Indian country, one becomes aware of the fact that so far as the map is concerned, the white man has almost expunged the record of the red man's dominion. Only here and there will be found a word the sounds and syllables of which suggest Indian origin. As one, in fancy, peoples again these sun-burned mesas and sage brush plains with their breech-clouted and moccasined inhabitants one finds oneself asking the question: What did the Indians call the mountains, the valleys, and streams before the white man made his map and appended his strange and foreign names?\n\nIn naming the features of the land, why the white man's ruthless disregard of the ancient and time honored nomenclature of the race he has superseded?\n\nAre the newer names more euphonious, or dignified, or interesting, or appropriate, or do they possess in any way a better logic of fitness that rendered the re-christening advisable?\n\nIn most instances we will find that the new settlers scarcely paused long enough to ask the Indians if the country and its parts were named. Perhaps our pioneer forebears thought the humble red man had not sense enough to name his landmarks; perhaps they thought him too stolid and unimaginative to create a fitting name; or perhaps their Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian tongues were too thick to twist themselves around the Indian words, and the Indians were unable to explain the meaning of the names they had bestowed. At any rate, few are the original names that have survived the re-christening. Some of the changes were justifiable, some excusable, some were improvements, but many of them were without reason, and the names given are not as good as the names they superseded. Our map carries many names that are wholly void of sense or meaning, and bear absolutely no relationship to, or connection with, the places to which they have been attached—names that have been coined with only the thought of euphony, or names transplanted from other states or countries and given without thought of natural fitness.\n\nWhat effort has been made to ascertain and record the names by which our country and its parts were designated by the Indians who inhabited it? Much of this information has already been lost except as some early historian had the forethought to record it, for, of the Indians who lived when the whites came, but few are left. For forty or fifty years these people have been using the white man's names, and the younger generations have come to know but little about the older nomenclature.\n\nIt is not easy to get such information now, for the Indians are not often communicative even with their trusted friends. The older Indians who know the names have a very limited understanding of English. It is difficult to make them understand what is wanted. And then there is the ever present mercenary demand, 'What you give, what you give?\" President A. W. Ivins, a noted Utah pioneer and scout, some time ago asked a Pahute chief to tell him the Indian names of the settlements of Iron County, Utah. After a brief consultation with his tribesmen, the chief came back with the terse proposition, \"Cedar, Parowan, pe-ap (big) towns, $10.00 each; Paragonah, Kanarra, not so big towns, $7.00 each; Enoch, Summit, me-a-poots (little towns) $5.00 each.\"\n\nAfter several years of patient opportunity seeking, and not a little bargaining and bribing, I am able to pass down to history a few of the lost names, and to give the meaning of some others.\n\nThe data herein presented have been gathered over a period of several years from Indians of all the intermontane tribes, and have been checked and re-checked with the Shivwits, Kaibabits, Utes, Pahvantits, Pahutes and Shoshones. Like most primitive peoples they are not widely traveled. They know but little of the country north of Utah Lake, and this treatise will, therefore cover the southern half of the great inter-mountain basin.\n\nFor more convenient study we will separate the treatise into three sub-divisions as follows :\n\nFirst, Indian names unchanged by the whites.\n\nSecond, Names of Indian origin given by the whites. Third, Indian names not adopted by the whites.\n\nIndian Names Unchanged by the Whites\n\nA study of the Great Basin map reveals some names that are of unquestioned Indian origin, but it is interesting to know that only a comparative few of them were applied to their particular place by the Indians themselves. Among these few it seems safe to class the following:\n\nUtah.\n\nWhen the Mormon pioneers entered the inter-mountain empire three quarters of a century ago, all the country now embraced in the State of Utah from latitude forty-one to the southern state boundary and extending on to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, was the tribal domain of the Ute Indian nation. This great nation was divided into several (Escalante says five) independent tribes, and these, in turn, were subdivided into many smaller clans which are usually, though erroneously, called tribes.\n\nAmong the Indians of Ute stock may be mentioned the Utes, Pahutes, Pahvantits, Shivwits, Kaibabits, Uintkarets, and several others. The language of these several tribes and clans is essentially Ute, though in the long separations, many provincialisms have crept in and modified the mother tongue.\n\nWhen referred to collectively, all these tribes and clans embraced in the Ute Nation are called by the Indians \"Ute-ahs.\" Occasionally, though less frequently, one hears them called \"Uintas.\" They speak of the inter-mountain country as \"Tuweap-ah Ute-ah\" which means land or country of the Utes.\n\nDiscussing the Mormon settlement of Utah with a group of Pahutes one day, an old Indian excitedly jumped up and sweeping his arms to indicate the whole country said to me, \"Soka tuweap-ah Ute-ah, Mormonie cu-up.\" Interpreted he said, \"This whole country belonged to the Utes but the Mormons came and took it.\"\n\nAnother time I had this conversation at the camp. Pointing to a strange Indian who had just come in I asked, Who is he? The answer in broken English was, \"He Ute-ah, no sabe me where come.\" He meant, I don't know where or what clan he comes from but he is a Ute.\n\nFrom the Indian usage cited it seems safe to conclude that our word Utah comes from the Indian word of similar pronunciation, and is a collective noun meaning all clans of the Ute Nation.\n\nGoing back a step further, I have tried to ascertain the meaning of the word \"Ute.\" To most Indians it is, \"J ust name,\" or, \"Just kind Indian.\" Brig, (whose Indian name is Tu-cu-pit, wild cat), a good Pahute interpreter, ventured the opinion that it means \"tall.\" His line of reasoning, however, seemed not altogether convincing to the other Indians, but there is some historic background to support him. The great Ute chief, Walker, is said to have been six and a half feet tall, and chief Coal Creek John, of Walker's royal lineage, stood over six feet in his moccasins. Brig's idea is that \"Ute\" means tall Indians.\n\nWasatch Mountains, Utah.\n\nThis main inter-mountain range almost bisects Utah from north to south.\n\nThe name is of Ute origin and is pronounced by them \"Wahsats.\" It has several usages, but as applied to mountains it means a traveled valley between mountains—a mountain pass— or a low pass over a high range. Where such a pass is traversed by a definite road or trail, the road or trail is called \"paw wahsats.\" Here it will be well to get a clear understanding of the words pa, pah, and paw, as they are root words in a large number of Indian names. Pa, or pah, the a sounded as in at, pat, etc., means water. Paw—a sounded as in all, Paul, etc., means road or trail.\n\nThe word wah-sats also means a fork, as forks of a road, forks of a river, or forks of a tree.\n\nKoosharem.\n\nAn Indian village near Richfield, Utah. The name is pronounced by the Indians koo-shar-omp. It means roots that are good to eat. A plant flourished there the roots of which they cooked and ate. It is described as about the size and shape of a small carrot, and of similar flavor.\n\nPahvant.\n\nA large valley in west central Utah. The Pahvant valley in Millard County, Utah, is a part of the ancient Lake Bonneville. To the Indians, Sevier Lake was the outstanding physical feature of this valley. When the whites came it was much larger than it now is. It was, and still is, the largest sheet of water between Utah Lake and the Colorado River. It was the largest body of water within the Pahute realms, and largest in the experience of most of the Southern Utah Indians. The valley was the home of quite a strong tribe who had, at one time or another, farmed all around the lake shore. Fields belonging to this tribe, with corn, wheat and beans still standing, were found by the Iron County colony of settlers on their march south in December, 1850. They named the place Corn Creek from the incident of finding corn there.\n\nThe word \"Pah-vant\"—a sounded as in at—means \"close to water.\" One Indian gave the definition \"down to water.\" Another said, \"by the water.\" Another said \"at the water.\" Still another pointed to the ground and said \"water right there.\"\n\nPah-vent, or pa-vent, means on the water, as a duck or a boat.\n\nThe Indians who lived in the vicinity of Sevier Lake, or who lived within the Sevier Lake valley, were called \"Pah-vant-its,\" meaning Indians from the vicinity of the big water (lake). The suffix \"its\" as used here means the same as our word \"ites,\" when we say Ogdenites, Denverites, etc. The same suffix is found in a number of variations such as \"wits,\" \"ats,\" \"uts,\" \"is,\" \"ich,\" \"ints,\" \"intez,\" etc. Such variations are accounted for in the fact that articulation is not uniform among the various tribes, and then it is often difficult to make an exact rendition of Indian sounds into written English. Of these variations, \"wits,\" \"its,\" \"uts,\" and \"is\" are of most common usage.\n\nThe Pahvant Valley was also called by the Indians \"Pe-ap Tu-weap\" which in this case meant \"big country,\" or \"big valley.\" Peap, or pe-amp is big, tu-weap is earth or ground.\n\nPanguitch,3 Utah.\n\nCounty seat of Garfield County, Utah.\n\nPa-gu or Pang-we is fish. Panguitch is big or heavy fish. Panguitch Lake was called \"Guitch-pa-garit.\" Pa-garit or pa-car-it is lake. Guitch-pa-garit means fish lake. The little band of Indians who sometimes lived around the lake in the summer months were called \"Pa-gu-its.\"\n\nParowan, Utah.\n\nCounty seat of Iron County. The translation of this word is \"mean water,\" or \"evil water.\" It does not mean bad water, or stinking water, or stagnant water, or salt lake water,—definitions that have been given, —but literally mean or wicked water. Pa—a sounded as in at— is water. Ruan is evil or mean.\n\nThe name has its origin in a legend which says that at one time when the Indians were camped near Little Salt Lake the water rushed up and \"stole a man.\" He was carried far out and was never seen again. They say that the lake bottom had holes in it, and that the water sometimes \"jumped high up.\" There may have been volcanic disturbances there, or the lake may at one time have been a geyser.\n\nAn exploring party of fifty men under command of Parley P. Pratt came into Southern Utah during the winter of 1849-50. This company held a celebration January 8, 1850, on the present site of Parowan. They feasted, raised a liberty pole, and held a meeting during which the place was dedicated as \"the site of the city Little Salt Lake as long as the sun shone upon it.\" One year later the pioneer company came down, arriving at the liberty pole January 13, 1851. Immediately they commenced the building of a town. The name given the place by Parley P. Pratt was never used, and the settlement remained nameless until May 16, 1851 when, in a council meeting attended by Brigham Young, the Indian name Parowan was adopted.\n\nParagoonah.\n\nIn Iron County, Utah. Pronounced by the Indians Pa-ra-goon-ah, also Pa-ragoone. Its meaning is somewhat in doubt. Some Indians say it is \"by a lake;\" others say \"roiley or muddy water;\" others say \"creek with caving banks;\" others say \"just name.\" Pa is water, goone or goonah is hole. Breaking the word thus it would mean water hole, but the Indians do not incline to that definition. The place is sometimes called Red Creek, and because of this some whites have ascribed to the word Paragoonah the meaning of \"red water.\" This is not correct. There is no syllable or combination of sounds that suggests such a translation. The Indians disclaim such meaning. Un-ka or un-ka-ga is red.\n\nThe Utes say the word Paragoonah means many springs or marshes, and this perhaps is the correct interpretation. Over the low lands of the Paragoonah Creek there were meadows with many springs and mud holes when the settlers came upon the stream. The Indian who gave this interpretation was not aware of the physical fact of the existence of springs when the name was applied, for most of them dried up before his day, when the settlers diverted the stream upon the upper fields. His definition however, describes the place so perfectly that there can be little doubt of the correctness of his rendition.\n\nPahranagat. 4\n\nA valley in Southern Nevada.\n\nIn early days this valley was a favorite hunting and fishing ground. There was much water, and ducks and water-fowl abounded. The valley, however, was everywhere wet and marshy and the hunters' feet were always wet. From this fact the valley took its name. Pa-ran-a-gat literally says \"your feet in the water.\"\n\nIbapa.\n\nA Utah Indian village. The Indian word is Av-im-pa. Avim is white clay, and pa is water.\n\nThe combination Avimpa means creek with white clay banks, or water in white clay.\n\nKanab. 5\n\nCounty seat of Kane County, Utah, and on the Grand Canyon highway. Named from the Indian word kanav which means willows. In the early days the place that is now Kanab Wash was a willow-covered creek bottom.\n\nToquer.\n\nToquerville, Utah, a settlement on the Zion Park Highway, takes its name from the black volcanic mountain against which it nestles. Toquer is Ute for black.\n\nParia.\n\nThe Paria River is a tributary of the Colorado. The Indian word is \"paria-noquint\" which means Elk River. Paria is Ute for elk.\n\nMagotsa.\n\n(In Utah.) The old emigrant route to California ran from Cedar City west through the Iron Springs pass, up the desert past what is now the towns of Newcastle and Enterprise, over the hills to Mountain Meadows, thence over the southern divide and down the slope to the Magotsa. The Indian word is Ma-haut-sa, and means the end of a long slope. The word Topeka means the same.\n\nMukuntuweap.6\n\nThe main gorge of Zion National Park bears almost straight northward, and confines within its vertical walls the waters of the Mukuntuweap. The stream emerges into Zion at the point called the Narrows.\n\nSome writers have ascribed to Zion Canyon the Indian name Mukuntuweap,—a mistake that arises out of a failure to distinguish between the canyon and the stream. The Indian name for Zion Canyon was I-u-goone, or I-oo-gune, and the river Mukuntuweap flows through it.\n\nVarious meanings have been ascribed to the word Mukuntuweap, such as \"place of the gods,\" \"place of many waters,\" etc. These are nothing more than fanciful guesses as there is nothing in the word to suggest any of them.\n\nTechnically speaking, the name as given above is incorrect. It should be Mukunt-o-weap, but the error may be accounted for in the fact that the Indian pronunciation of the letter o is often oo as in soon, coon, etc., and might easily be mistaken for u. \"Tuweap\" is ground or earth, not creek. \"O-weap\" technically defined, is a dry wash or a dry canyon. However it is often loosely used to mean just canyon, and occasionally is applied to a stream flowing through a canyon. The latter is the usage in this case.\n\nAmong the Indians this stream has two names. Coincidentally they sound so nearly alike as to pass for the same, yet they are of different derivation and differ widely in meaning.\n\nThe Arizona Indians call the stream \"Muk-unk-o-weap.\" Muk-unk is a variety of oose the root of which served several domestic purposes. The crown and inner root core were used by the Indians and even by the white pioneers for soap. In water it lathered like soap and had excellent cleansing qualities. The long outer root fibre was shredded and twisted into rope, and into strings for rabbit snares. The plant grew especially thrifty along the river and the Indians went there to gather it, for which reason they called the stream \"Mukunk-o-weap.\" Of the Indians who use this name, some translate it \"Oose Creek,\" while others say \"Soap Creek.\" As both the soap and the oose are called \"mukunk,\" there need be no confusion over the root word.\n\nThe Cedar City Indians, separated from the Arizona Indians by a great mountain range, call this same stream \"Mukunt-o-weap.\" Muk-unt means straight, and o-weap, canyon stream. This is doubtless the source and meaning of the name that has gone into our maps.\n\nParunuweap.7\n\nThe Parunuweap empties into Mukuntuweap from the east. It seems to mean water running swiftly into a deep hole or deep canyon. This word also, for reasons given above, should be spelled Pa-run-o-weap.\n\nParashont.\n\nThe Parashont range on the Arizona Strip is well known to the livestock men of Southern Utah. The Indian word for the country is \"Paria-a-saut,\" and means tanned elk skin. Parashont has a mild climate with long periods of open fall weather. For this reason it was a favorite gathering place for the southern Indian bands to meet after the fall hunting season. Here they visited and dried their meats and tanned their skins.\n\nToroweap, Tuweap.\n\nThe Toroweap Valley leads southward from Pipe Springs National Monument to the Colorado River, and is destined to become a great winter highway to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. It is sometimes called Tu-weap Valley, though this is erroneous. The word tu-weap simply means earth. Toro-weap means a gully or a wash,—not a canyon or deep gorge.\n\nWah-weap.\n\nThere are several valleys in Utah and in Nevada called bv the Indians Wah-weap. The word means alkaline seeps or salt licks. It also means little valleys or hollows containing stagmant pools or brackish seeps.\n\nMoapa. 8\n\nMoapa Valley in Nevada has almost become nationally known for its famed Moapa cantaloupes. The Indians also called the valley \"Mo-a-pa.\" The word means a valley or mouth of a canyon with a large stream of water flowing through it.\n\nTimpanoquint, Timpanogos.9\n\nThe Provo River, Utah, and Mount Timpanogos near by. The word Timpanoquint has been slightly changed and transferred by our geographers from the river to the mountain. Mt. Timpanogos was known to the Indians as \"Pa-ak-ar-et Kaib. meaning very high mountain. The word \"timp-pa\" belongs to the river. The full name for Provo River was \"Timp-pa-noquint,\" which interpreted is as follows: timp, rock; pa, water; no-quint, running,—water running over rocks or a stream with a rocky bed.\n\nIndian Names Given by the Whites\n\nIt would be quite natural that some of the words of the Indian tongue would impress themselves upon the white new comers. When the settlers were casting about for names it would be expected that some of these Indian words would come to the surface and be adopted. In some such instances the meaning of the word would be of secondary consideration. It was enough that it sounded well. The appellation might be the name of some friendly or otherwise outstanding chief, some object or condition, or, perhaps a word of Indian origin but brought from far distant tribes. Such instances are comparatively few. and the following will serve as illustrations.\n\nKanarra, Utah.\n\nAn Iron County settlement on the Zion Park Highway, named for a friendly chief, who, with his tribe, lived on the stream that now bears his name. The old chief met his death near Enoch, Utah, by being thrown from a horse.\n\nKanosh, Utah.\n\nIn Pahvant Valley and on the Zion Park Highway. This town was named for the Chief Kanosh of the Pahvantits tribe, who became a convert to Mormonism. It is said of him that his dark skin turned gradually lighter until he became almost like a white man.\n\nPanaca, Nevada.\n\nThis town was named by its Mormon settlers from the Indian word panacar, or panagar, which means money. It also means iron, copper, silver or other metals. Sometimes it is applied to metalliferous ores. When the old mining camp, Bullionville, opened up and the Indians saw the metal being extracted from the rocks, they called the camp \"Panacar.\" Later, when the Mormons colonized the same valley, they adopted the Indian name.\n\nMoccasin, Arizona.\n\nThis is a ranch near Pipe Springs National Monument, in Arizona, and is the site of one of the Government Indian Reservations. Its Indian name before the coming of the whites was Pa-it-spick-ine, which meant \"bubbling springs.\" ^Pa, is water, and spickant, springs. The variation above means bubbling or boiling.\n\nThe place was called Moccasin by the white men from the incident of finding a pair of moccasins at the springs.\n\nIt may be news to many to learn that \"moccasin\" is not the word of the western Indians for their footwear. This word comes to us through New England literature rather than from western Indian usage. Likewise \"wigwam.\" The Ute calls his buckskin shoes \"new-o-pats,\" \"patsun,\" or just \"pats,\" and his home is \"can.\" The words moccasin and wigwam, while of Indian origin, are as foreign to the Ute as they are to us. Moccasin has gained usage among them through the constant application of the word on the part of the whites.\n\nNavajo Lake, Utah.\n\nNear Cedar Breaks. This name was derived from a skirmish there between citizens of Kanarra and Harmony, and a band of marauding Navajoes. The Indians had raided these settlements and driven off a number of horses. The settlers pursued and overtook the thieves at the lake. The Indians in surprise, scattered in all directions, leaving camp equipment and even much of their clothing and footwear and several of their horses. The Indian name for this lake was \"Pa-cu-ab.\"\n\nPiute, Utah.\n\nA county in Utah. The word is a corruption of the tribal Pah-ute, or Pai-ute. It is therefore of Indian origin and is one of the few Indian names that was bestowed by the whites. I say bestowed, rather than adopted, because the Indians never used it in the sense that we use it. They applied it to the tribe, while we have applied it to a country.\n\nMoreover, it may be noted that the territory embraced within the boundaries of Piute County was never any part of the Pahute Indian realm. This is an illustration of our heedless application of Indian words. The Pahutes were one of the Independent tribes of the Ute nation. The boundaries of their domain were quite definitely defined and recognized by the other tribes. It was that country lying west of the range of mountains, and extending from the Pahvant Valley (inclusive), southward to the Virgin River. Also that country between the Virgin and Colorado Rivers, from Kaibab Mountains (inclusive), westward to the junction of the two streams. When our geographers, or law makers, or whoever was responsible for the naming of the county, bestowed the word Piute on the County it never occurred to them, perhaps, that they were outside the Pahute boundaries or even that the Pahutes ever had a domain of their own.\n\nIndian Names Not Used by the Whites\n\nThe Indians had every landmark, and in fact, every part of the country named, quite as much as we have them named now. Their appellations were usually derived from some characteristic of the places themselves and were, as a rule, significant and appropriate. This Inter-Mountain west was Indian country, and it is regrettable that more of the Indian names were not retained. It would have added much to the interest of travelers to this tourist Mecca if the Indian language had been more liberally spread over its face.\n\nAs already indicated, not many of the original Ute names were adopted by the settlers. As time went on the Indians came more and more to use the white man's names and to drop the use of their own. Most of the Indians who were here fifty to seventy years ago are now on their Happy Hunting Grounds, and with them have gone many of the names they knew in this estate. Persistent inquiry has stimulated much discussion of the question among old and young of the tribe, and has brought to light the following unused names:\n\nI-u-goone or I-oo-gune.\n\nThis was the name of the principal canyon in Zion National Park. U-goone or Oo-gune was the name of the Indian arrow quiver. I-u-goone means \"like the arrow quiver.\"\n\nOne has only to go into the narrow canyon with its sheer three-thousand-foot walls on either side, to see how significant and appropriate the name. The feeling is almost akin to walking into a great sack. The old man who gave me the word illustrated it by going through the motions of putting an arrow into a quiver and then drawing it out again, saying, \"have to come out where he go in.\" Another Indian explained the word by putting his open left hand flat on his knee and spreading two fingers into an open V. Placing his right index finger at the mouth of the V. he drew it down between the fingers and then back out, commenting as he did it, \"all same arrow sack, can't get out, can't lose out.\"\n\nFantastic stories are sometimes told the traveler to Southern Utah about the fear of the Indian that darkness might overtake him in the Zion Canyon, and of his belief that the Canyon is the home of God. Also, that of the game he killed there, he always left a choice quarter on some clean rock as a peace offering to-the deity that had prospered him.\n\nThese pretty stories seldom fail to interest the eastern visitor, and incidentally they tend to create certain desired dramatic traditions concerning the Park. Guides and others about the Park who tell these stories suppose them to be true, but, like many other pretty stories, they seem to have no foundation in fact. The Indians tell of long encampments in Zion Canyon— even long enough to raise corn and squash.\n\n(Juab: See Taw-gu-Uav.)\n\nQuitch-o-wer.\n\nOne of the Zion peaks was called Quitchower. The word means \"like a peak,\" or sharp pointed.\n\nPa-ron-tink-an.\n\nAnother of the great Zion escarpments was called Pa-rontink-an. Roughly translated the word means \"Shelter Mountain.\" The Indians tell of the mountain having many overhanging rocks and holes and shallow caves where they could live in stormy weather.\n\nUn-cap-i-cun-ump.\n\nThe Cedar Breaks National monument was called Uncapi. cunump. The word means a circle of painted cliffs, also a circle of red cliffs.\n\nUnka Carur, also Unka Caru.\n\nIt is a red mountain near Cedar City, Utah. Unka is red and carur, or caru is hill. The name simply says Red Hill.\n\nWa-see-ap-to.\n\nThe place that is now Cedar City, Utah. The name means a grove of scrub cedars. These trees covered the site of Cedar City when the white settlers came. This grove was the basis of the names given the place by both the whites and the Indians.\n\nWap-pa-no-quint, also O-wap-pa-no-quint.\n\nCoal Creek, the stream that flows through Cedar City, Utah, Wap or O-wap means cedars, pa is water, and no-quint running. The translation of Wap-pa-no-quint is, therefore, \"a stream of water running through cedars.\" \"Coal Creek\" has been criticised as a hideous name for a beautiful canyon. Why not remove the objection by dropping our name and adopting the musical Wap-pa-no-quint ?\"\n\nPa-rap-it.\n\nRush Lake in Iron County, Utah, was called Pa-rap-it. It means \"Lake with no outlet.\"\n\nKaib Whit, Kaib-a-harur.\n\nPine Valley Mountains, Utah. One of the newly opened scenic attractions of Southern Utah is Pine Valley Mountains. This range parallels on the west, the southern end of the Wasatch. The chain is comparatively short, being less than fifty miles in length, but is rugged and colorful, the extreme southern end rising abruptly to an altitude of eleven thousand feet. The range is divided by natural passes into three divisions, each of which was named by the Indians.\n\nThe southern promontory had two names. By the Indians of St. George, Utah, it was called Kaib-Whit, while the Cedar City Indians called it \"Kaib-a-harur.\"\n\nThe name Kaib-whit seems to have no definite meaning other than the syllable Kaib, which is mountain. This is the same word as Kaib used in the name Kaibab Mountain 10 which means \"mountain lying down.\" The word \"Kaib-a-harur\" is capable of clearer translation. It means \"Mountain standing still.\"\n\nTo-ag-ar-er, Muk-quavish Kaib.\n\nThe middle division of the Pine Valley range was called Toag-ar-er, and the northern division, terminating at the historic Iron Springs Pass, was named Mukquavish Kaib.\n\nPan-ag-up, Pan-ag-a-pa.\n\nIron Springs, Utah. The Iron Springs Pass is \"Panagup.\" The springs and creek are \"Panagapa.\" Panagar or Panacar is iron, and pa water. Panagapa, therefore means to an Indian just what Iron Springs might mean to a white man. The name is derived from the adjacent Iron mountain.\n\nTo-no-quitch-i-wunt. Wyant.\n\nTonoquitchiwunt, meaning Little Black Mountains, are the hills south of Iron Springs, and Wyant (five peaks) are the hills northward.\n\nTaw-gu-Uav, or Taw-gu Juav. (The J silent)\n\nGoing westward through Iron Springs Pass, Utah, one comes out upon a wide stretch of unwatered plain known locally as \"The West Desert.\" The Indians gave it the name Tawgu Uav. Tawgu means thirsty. The word Uav means desert, or wide valley, and sometimes meadow—a level stretch of country—a plain. It is the same word as Juab, the name of one of Utah's counties. The journal of Isaac C. Haight, a member of the Pratt exploring company of 1849, speaks of the Juab Valley as \"Yoab.\" Tawgu- Uav—thirsty plain—is a most appropriate name for the country it covers.\n\nThe Iron Springs Pass was, in the early days, the gateway for two important roads, the old freight road to the early Nevada mining camps, and the southern California emigrant trail. Going westward a day's travel over the old freight road brought the traveler to,—\n\nO-weve, or O-wavie,—or O-weve Spickant.\n\nKnown to the freighter as Desert Springs, near the Utah- Nevada line. The Indian name means \"Wheat grass springs.\" The old Desert Springs in freighting days was the scene of many crimes, robberies, murders and cattle rustlings. Under the ownership of the historic outlaw, Ben Tasker, the old ranch was the rendezvous of the stage robbers and cattle thieves that infested the Utah-Nevada boundary region.\n\nTune-to-u.\n\nEagle Valley, in Nevada, was Tunetou, which means a \"V\" shaped valley.\n\nTimp-i-ah.\n\nIs known to us as Spring Valley, Nevada. It means \"Rock Canyon widening out.\"\n\nSega-wina.\n\nRose Valley, Nevada. The Indians tell of a cave there, the roof of which is pointed like a house gable. Up into the crevice of the roof the old Indians shot many arrows which have stuck there to this day. Sega means pointed roof. The valley took its name from this cave.\n\nQuev-wim-pa. Antelope Springs, Utah.\n\nReturning now to the Iron Springs Pass in Utah, and tracing from there the old California emigrant trail, we come first to Antelope Springs which had the musical Indian name Quevwim-pa.\n\nO-wee-tu.\n\nMouth of Pinto Canyon, Utah.\n\nThe mouth of Pinto Canyon was the junction of two branches of the old trail. It was called by the Indians Oweetu which means end, or mouth, of the canyon. At this historic place there still remains the cedar stumps of what was once an ox shoeing stall.\n\nTu-ra-tu-ma, Tu-ra-at-tu.\n\nPerhaps the next point of interest in going over the old California trail would be Mountain Meadows, Utah. The Cedar City Indians call this place Tu-ra-tu-ma, while the Nevada Indians call it Tu-ra-eat-tu. The latter say it means a wide rolling valley up in the mountains. To the former it means an open treeless plain in the mountains.\n\nCang-it-cho-ip. Pilot Peak, Utah.\" One of the important landmarks on the California road was Pilot Peak near the present town of Enterprise, Utah. This mountain standing apart and rising to a high, sharp peak, could be seen by the traveler going or coming, for great distances. It was no less a guide to the red man in his western wanderings. He called it Cang-it-cho-ip. Cang is mountain ground, and choip is head. As a name Cangit-choip means mountain head—a peak that stands above or apart from the rest.\n\nPa-ha-weap.\n\nThe Colorado River. Of the streams, first in importance to the Pahute was, perhaps, the Colorado. He called it Pa-ha-weap. Interpreted it means \"water down deep in the earth,\" or \"along way down to water.\"\n\nPa-russ.\n\nThe Rio Virgin.\n\nThe Rio Virgin is a tributary of the Colorado. The river was explored in the early months of the year 1853 by fifteen men from Parowan, Utah, under command of John D. Lee. Theytraversed the stream from Zion Canyon to its mouth. The Indians called it Pa-roos or Pah-roos, which means a dirty turbulent stream, all of which it is. The name is far more fitting than Virgin/ 2 which decidedly it is not.\n\nIn 1776 Father Escalante, the Spanish explorer, crossed the Virgin River at the mouth of Ash Creek and went on south over the ground where Hurricane now stands. The Father found onthe river a colony of Indians who were raising corn and other garden crops by irrigation. These he called the Parrusis. They were not a distinct tribe. They were Pahutes but were called Parrusis from the fact that they lived on the Parrus or Pa-roos river.\n\nTo-no-quint, Tots-qua-qui-toa.\n\nTwo tributaries of the Rio Virgin are Ash Creek called Tono-quint, and Santa Clara called Tots-qua-qui-toa. The derivative of both names is black. To-no-quint is stream carrying black silt, and tots-qua-qui-toa means dark colored country. The name is derived from the black lava rock that covers the hills.\n\nWhen the Mormons came, there was a tribe living on the Santa Clara called Tonoquints, or tonoquint-its. Only one member of this tribe is alive today. His name is Tam-a-lots. He is living on the Shivwits Reservation.\n\nU-nav-ich.\n\nBlack Ridge, Utah.\n\nU-naw-weap.\n\nAsh Creek Canyon. Ash Creek cuts its way through the Black Ridge which is called by the Indians U-naw-ich, and its gorge or canyon—dry part of the season—is called U-naw-weap.\n\nA-Va-pa, and Ava-pa-noquint.\n\nSevier River, Utah. The Sevier River, one of the larger Utah streams, was called Avapa. It seems to mean big quiet waters, or big placid river.\n\nPah-ince No-quint.\n\nBeaver River, Utah. The fur bearing beaver is called pah-ince. No-quint is river. The Indian name for this stream is, therefore, just the same as ours,—Beaver River.\n\nSaw-on-quint.\n\nOn-o-cutch.\n\nBear Valley, Utah.\n\nPa-hump-pa.\n\nCove Fort, Utah.\n\nThe first company of Southern Utah settlers encamped on this stream, January 5, 1851, and gave it the name Cove Creek. A few years later a heavy stone fort was built there for the protection of emigrants and freighters from Indian attack. Since the fort was built, the name has been changed froir. Cove Creek to Cove Fort.\n\nChee-ava, Chee-ava-pa.\n\nBuckhorn Springs, Utah, on the Zion Park highway. A much used camp ground on the California southern route in early days was Buckhorn Springs, on the northern rim of the valley of the Little Salt Lake. The country round about was known to the Indians as Chee-ava. The spring was called Cheeava-pa. Formerly flourishing there was a plant called cheeava which was good food for both man and animal. It grew twelve to twenty inches high and the stalk only was eaten. I have been unable to identify it.\n\nSak-ar-at Kaib.\n\nMount Baldy, Utah, one of the highest peaks of the Wasatch range, always snow-capped and seen from long distances north or south, was to the early emigrant an important landmark. The Indians knew it by the fitting name Sak-ar-at Kaib, which, interpreted means White Mountain.\n\nSe-ma-to.\n\nNew Harmony, Utah. This was one of the early pioneer settlements. The Indian name means a cove.\n\nPa-hump-ton-inch.\n\nThe eastern foot of Pine Valley Mountains, Utah, had many springs, seeps and cane breaks. The climate was mild and it was a favorite winter ground for the Indians. From the cane beds they gathered many arrows which they feathered and spiked during the winter months. Certain spots of land were sub-irrigated and the Indians found this locality one of the best places for their gardening. Pa-hump is cane. The foothill country was called Pa-hump-ton-inch.\n\nPsock-o-atcs.\n\nPintura, Utah. On the Zion Park highway. The Pintura section was and still is, covered with a heavy brush called by the Indians Psockoatcs, and from it the country took its name. To the freighters in the days of the old Silver Reef mining camp, Pintura was known as Bellvue.\n\nO-wat-ie.\n\nLong Valley, Utah. It means yellow valley.\n\nU-an-no or U-un-o.\n\nSt. George, Utah. The St. George valley was a favorite wintering ground. The climate was semi-tropical. The Indians tell of some farming there. They raised corn and squash and some plant from which they harvested a black seed which was stored for winter. From it they made a black bread. U-un-o means a good garden place, or good fields. U-an-o is also a general term for the country we call \"Dixie.\"\n\nPa-ve-ah.\n\nThe Hurricane Valley was known as Pah-ve-ah and seems to mean a long north-south valley.\n\nChun-qua-wak-ab.\n\nThe geologically famous Hurricane Fault forms the east wall of Hurricane Valley. The Indian name Chunquawakab means a long line of cliffs.\n\nMa-ag-ara Kaib.\n\nThe range of mountains between St. George and the Colo rado River was called Maagara Kaib, which means mountains with many kinds of trees on them. They are now frequently called Shivwits Mountains because the Shivwits Indians lived on them.\n\nUnka-timpe Wa-wince Pock-ich.\n\nBryce Canyon National Monument, Utah. Just as we have given one name to the whole canyon and other names to its separate parts, so also did the Indians. The above is the general Indian term covering the whole Bryce section. Translation is as follows: Pockich (now often Americanized into pockets) means a bowl shaped canyon; unka is red timpe is rocks, and wa-wince means standing up like men. The whole, therefore, means a bowl shaped canyon filled with red rocks standing up like men.\n\nIn general usage a shorter name, Unka-carru-chich, is given, but this technically speaking, is the name for only one section of Bryce. This means a group of red ridges or peaks.\n\nIn the lower stretches of the Canyon service berries abounded. An Indian trail from the Paria once wound itself among these bushes, passing up through the Canyon and over the divide where now the Bryce Lodge stands. This trail was called \"Te-ar-ump Paw,\" which says \"service berry trail.\"\n\nOne of the Bryce Points was called \"Uimp-ab-ich,\"—Pine Tree Point.\n\nThat part of the Canyon between the rock filled bowl and the town of Tropic was known as \"We-ump O-weap,\" or in English \"Wild Grape Canyon.\"\n\nPa-ant-oo-Kaib.\n\nPowell Mountain, Utah. Standing at the Bryce Lodge and looking eastward, one sees in the distance, a large white sided mountain which is known as Powell Mountain. The Indians call it \"Pa-ant-oo Kaib.\" Some say \"Pa-ant-ing Kaib.\" The meaning is \"Big Mountain.\"\n\nThe white point on which Powell built his observation monument is called \"Av-imp-co A-vant,\" which means white faced point.\n\nThe Valley lying between Bryce and Powell Mountain and in which the town of Tropic is situated is called \"Av-o-ab.\" The name means a valley bordered with cliffs or caved banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion let me remind the reader that the Indian has no written language. He has, therefore, no authoritative standard by which to hold his speech uniform. Every camp has its provincialisms, and one often gets several pronunciations of what is manifestly the same word. Much of the conversation is implied from gestures and facial expressions. Then there is the difficulty of rendering in written English the syllables and sounds of the Indian tongue. Sometimes this is impossible. It can only be approximated.\n\nThere may be students of the Indian tongue who will not agree with my spelling and translations. To such I would say that the Indian etymology of this region is an open field with no authorities, and no standards. I try to spell a word and to break it into syllables just as it sounds, but I find myself often spelling and dividing the same word differently when I get it from different Indians. Accent and inflection differ widely among them.\n\nAs a means of arriving as nearly as possible at accuracy, before offering this paper for publication all words presented herein, with their pronunciation and definitions, were submitted to the most intelligent and understanding Indians among the tribes of Southern Utah, and they approved the rendition. Names and words in my list which they said were wrong have been eliminated. After searching and using every test of proof, I pass on what has been given to me feeling that it is as nearly correct as painstaking research can make it.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Copyright, 1928, by Wm.
