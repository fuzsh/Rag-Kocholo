        "text": "What are Plus Codes?\n\nPlus Codes are like street addresses for people or places that donât have one. Instead of addresses with street names and numbers, Plus Codes are based on latitude and longitude, and displayed as numbers and letters. With a Plus Code, people can receive deliveries, access emergency and social services, or just help other people find them.\n\nOpen source and easy to use\n\nPlus Codes technology is open source and free to create and use. They are much shorter than traditional global coordinates, so theyâre easy to share.\n\nAccessible offline\n\nPlus Codes work whether youâre online or offlineâyou donât need an internet connection.\n\nLanguage independent\n\nPlus Codes are based on a set of 20 alphanumeric characters. They do not include easily confused characters, are not case-sensitive, and they exclude vowels.\n\nVersatile\n\nPlus Codes represent an area. The resolution of the area can be changed by adding or removing characters after the â+â sign."
