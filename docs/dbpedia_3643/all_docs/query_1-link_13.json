It was first built in Hebron by Elias Hunt and Aluna Terry Hunt about 1874 . Some years later there was a conflict over water rights, and the matter was taken to church court in St George. It was decided that the Hebron people who owned the water rights should move down to Enterprise where there was more land. They should share in the land and water together. The year was 1906, and my father, who was the youngest, was 2 years old. So my obedient grandparents immediately moved to the new Enterprise townsite and lived in a tent with their large family until spring. Then they dismantled their home in Hebron, salvaging bricks, rough sawn lumber, doors, windows, stoves, and everything, even the square nails and moved it all down the canyon with horses and wagons to the new town of Enterprise. They then re-built their home on the corner where it is still standing.\n\nOwners:\n\nElias & Aluna Hunt\n\nEdward Hunt\n\nZola Hunt\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nElias & Aluna Hunt Click here.\n\nPHOTOS\n\nWCHS-04719 The Elias & Aluna Hunt Home with flowers in bloom (Click here to enlarge)\n\nWCHS-04721\n\nWCHS-04722\n\nWCHS-04723\n\nOther WCHS photos:\n\nWCHS-04720 Photo of the Elias & Aluna Hunt Home with flowers in bloom\n\nREFERENCES\n\nTBD"
