        "text": "direction\n\nsee heading.\n\ndistance above surface\n\nIn addition to elevation and depth, a measurement of the vertical distance above a reference point, with a minimum and a maximum distance to cover a range. For surface terrestrial locations, the reference point should be the elevation at ground level. Over a body of water (ocean, sea, lake, river, glacier, etc.), the reference point for aerial locations should be the elevation of the air-water interface, while the reference point for sub-surface benthic locations should be the interface between the water and the substrate. Locations within a water body should use depth rather than a negative distance above surface. Distances above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. The maximum distance above a surface will always be a number greater than or equal to the minimum distance above the surface. Since distances below a surface are negative numbers, the maximum distance will always be a number less than or equal to the minimum distance. Compare altitude.\n\nDMS\n\nDegrees, minutes and seconds – one of the most common formats for expressing geographic coordinates on maps. A degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and each minute is divided into 60 seconds of arc. Degrees, minutes and seconds are denoted by the symbols °, ′, ″. Degrees of latitude are integers between 0 and 90, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (e.g. N or S). Degrees of longitude are integers between 0 and 180, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (e.g. E or W).\n\neasting\n\nWithin a coordinate reference system (e.g. as provided by a GPS or a map grid reference system), the line representing eastward distance from a reference meridian on a map.\n\nelevation\n\nA measurement of the vertical distance of a land or water surface above a vertical datum. On maps, the reference datum is generally some interpretation of mean sea level or the geoid, while in devices using GPS/GNSS, the reference datum is the ellipsoid of the geodetic datum to which the GPS unit is configured, though the device may make corrections to report the elevation above mean sea level or the geoid. Elevations that are above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. Compare depth, distance above surface, and altitude.\n\nellipsoid\n\nA three-dimensional, closed geometric shape, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three independent axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution. When used to represent a model of the earth, the ellipsoid is an oblate ellipsoid of revolution made by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.\n\nentry point\n\nThe entry point on the surface of the ocean or lake where a diver enters the water and from which all activities are measured. See Figure 7.\n\nEPSG\n\nEPSG codes are defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, using a spatial reference identifier (SRID) to reference spatial reference systems. The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (IOPG 2019) is a collection of definitions of coordinate reference systems (including datums) and coordinate transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in application.\n\nerror\n\nThe difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value. It encompasses both the imprecision of a measurement and its inaccuracies. Error can be either random or systematic. If the error is systematic, it is called \"bias\". Compare accuracy, bias, precision, false precision and uncertainty.\n\nevent\n\nA process occurring at a particular location during a period of time. Used generically to cover various kinds of collecting events, sampling events, and observations.\n\nextent\n\nThe entire space within the boundary a location actually represents. The extent can be a volume, an area, or a distance.\n\nfalse precision\n\nAn artefact of recording data with a greater number of decimal places than implied by the original data. This often occurs following transformations from one unit or coordinate system to another, for example from feet to meters, or from degrees, minutes, and seconds to decimal degrees. In general, precision cannot be conserved across metric transformations; however, in practice it is often recorded as such. For example, a record of 10°20’ stored in a database in decimal degrees is ~10.3°. When exported from some databases, it will result in a value of 10.3333333333 with a precision of 10 decimal places in degrees rather than the original precision of 1-minute. Misinterpreting the precision of the coordinate representation as a precision in distance on the ground, 10-10 degrees corresponds to about 0.002 mm at the equator, while the precision of 1-minute corresponds to about 2.6 km. This is not a true precision as it relates to the original data, but a false precision as reported from a combination of the coordinate conversion and the representation of resulting fraction in the export from a database. Compare with precision and accuracy.\n\nfeature\n\nAn object of observation, measurement, or reference that can be represented spatially. Often categorized into \"feature types\" (e.g. mountain, road, populated place, etc.) and given names for specific instances (e.g. \"Mount Everest\", \"Ruta 40\", \"Istanbul\"), which are also sometimes referred to as \"named places\", \"place names\" or \"toponyms\".\n\nfootprint\n\nSee shape. Note that \"footprint\" was used in some earlier georeferencing documents and in the Darwin Core term names footprintWKT and footprintSpatialFit.\n\ngazetteer\n\nAn index of geographical features and their locations, often with geographic coordinates.\n\ngeneralization\n\nIn geographic terms, refers to the conversion of a geographic representation to one with less resolution and less information content; traditionally associated with a change in scale. Also referred to as: fuzzying, dummying-up, etc. (Chapman 2020).\n\ngeocode\n\nThe process (verb) or product (noun) of determining the coordinates for a street address. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for georeference.\n\ngeodetic coordinate reference system\n\nA coordinate reference system based on a geodetic datum, used to describe positions on the surface of the earth.\n\ngeodetic datum\n\nA mathematical model that uses a reference ellipsoid to describe the size and shape of the surface of the earth and adds to it the information needed for the origin and orientation of coordinate systems on that surface.\n\ngeographic boundary\n\nThe representation in geographic coordinates of a vertical projection of a boundary onto a model of the surface of the earth.\n\ngeographic center\n\nThe midpoint of the extremes of latitude and longitude of a feature. Geographic centers are relatively easy to determine, but they generally do not correspond to the center obtained by a least circumscribing circle. For that reason it is not recommended to use a geographic center for any application in georeferencing. Compare corrected center.\n\ngeographic component\n\nThe part of a description of a location that consists of geographic coordinates and associated uncertainty. Non-geographic components of a location description include elevation, depth, and distance above surface.\n\ngeographic coordinate system\n\nA coordinate system that uses geographic coordinates.\n\ngeographic coordinate reference system\n\nA geodetic coordinate reference system that uses geographic coordinates.\n\ngeographic coordinates\n\nA measurement of a location on the earth’s surface expressed as latitude and longitude.\n\ngeographic extent\n\nThe entire space within the geographic boundary of a location. The geographic extent can be an area or a distance.\n\ngeographic information system (GIS)\n\nA set of computer-based tools designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, map, manage, and present all types of geographical data and information in the form of maps.\n\ngeographic radial\n\nThe distance from the corrected center of a location to the furthest point on the geographic boundary of that location. The geographical radial is what contributes to calculations of the maximum uncertainty distance using the point-radius georeferencing method. The term geographic radial, as defined here, replaces its equivalent \"extent\" used in the early versions of these Best Practices and related documents, including the Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Wieczorek et al. 2012a) and versions of the Georeferencing Calculator (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2018) and its Manual for the Georeferencing Calculator (Wieczorek & Bloom 2015) before 2019, while the new definition of extent as found in this document remains more in keeping with common usage and understanding and has also been updated in the latest versions of the Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020) and the Georeferencing Calculator Manual (Bloom et al. 2020).\n\ngeoid\n\nA global equipotential surface that approximates mean sea level. This surface is everywhere perpendicular to the force of gravity (Loweth 1997).\n\ngeometry\n\nThe measures and properties of points, lines, and surfaces. Geometry is used to represent the geographic component of locations.\n\ngeoreference\n\nThe process (verb) or product (noun) of interpreting a locality description into a spatially mappable representation using a georeferencing method. Compare with geocode. The usage here is distinct from the concept of georeferencing satellite and other imagery (known as georectification).\n\ngeoreferencing method\n\nThe theory, including a set of rules, general procedures and expected outcomes, meant to produce a specific type of spatial representation of a locality. In this document we discuss three particular methods of representation in detail, the shape method, the bounding box method, and the point-radius method.\n\ngeoreferencing protocol\n\nThe set of specific documented steps that can be applied to produce a spatial representation of a locality, following one or more georeferencing methods.\n\nGIS\n\nsee geographic information system.\n\nGlobally Unique Identifier (GUID)\n\nGlobally Unique Identifier, a 128-bit string of characters applied to one and only one physical or digital entity so that the string uniquely identifies the entity and can be used to refer to the entity. See also Persistent Identifier, PID.\n\nGNSS\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System, the generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide global autonomous geo-spatial positioning. This term encompasses GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou and other regional systems.\n\nGPS\n\nGlobal Positioning System, a satellite-based system used for determining positions on or near the Earth. Orbiting satellites transmit radio signals that allow a receiver to calculate its own location as coordinates and elevation, sometimes with accuracy estimates. See also GNSS of which GPS is one example. See also GPS (receiver).\n\nGPS (receiver)\n\nThe colloquial term used to refer to both GPS and GNSS receivers (including those in smartphones and cameras). A GPS or GNSS receiver is an instrument which, in combination with an inbuilt or separate antenna, is able to receive and interpret radio signals from GNSS satellites and translate them into geographic coordinates.\n\ngrid\n\na network or array of evenly spaced orthogonal lines used to organize space into partitions. Often these are superimposed on a map and used for reference, such as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid.\n\nground zero\n\nthe location on the land surface directly above a radiolocation point in a cave where the magnetic radiation lines are vertical. See Figure 10.\n\nGUID\n\nsee Globally Unique Identifier.\n\nheading\n\nCompass direction such as east or northwest, or sometimes given as degrees clockwise from north. Usually used in conjunction with offset to give a distance and direction from a feature.\n\nheight datum\n\nsee vertical datum.\n\nlatitude\n\nThe angular distance of a point north or south of the equator.\n\nlocality\n\nThe verbal representation of a location, also sometimes called \"locality description\".\n\nlocality clause\n\nA part of a locality description that can be categorized into one of the locality types, to which a specific georeferencing protocol can be applied.\n\nlocality type\n\nA category applied to a locality clause that determines the specific georeferencing protocol that should be used.\n\nlocation\n\nA physical space that can be positioned and oriented relative to a reference point, and potentially described in a natural language locality description. In georeferencing, a location can have distinct representations based on distinct rules of interpretation, each of which is embodied in a georeferencing method.\n\nlongitude\n\nThe angular distance of a point east or west of a prime meridian at a given latitude.\n\nmagnetic declination\n\nThe angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north (the direction the north end of a magnetized compass needle points, corresponding to the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field lines) and true north (the direction along a meridian towards the geographic North Pole). This angle varies depending on the position on the Earth’s surface and changes over time.\n\nmaximum uncertainty distance\n\nThe radius in a point-radius representation of a location, that is a numerical value that defines the upper limit of the horizontal distance from the position of the given geographic coordinate to a point on the outer extremity of the geographic area within which the whole of a location lies. When given in meters, it corresponds to the Darwin Core term coordinateUncertaintyInMeters.\n\nmean sea level (MSL)\n\nA vertical datum from which heights such as elevation are usually measured. Mean sea levels were traditionally determined locally by measuring the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location averaged over a 19-year period covering a complete tidal cycle. More recently, MSL is best described by a geoid.\n\nmeridian\n\nA line on the surface of the earth where all of the locations have the same longitude. Compare antimeridian and prime meridian.\n\nnamed place\n\nsee feature. Note that \"named place\" was used in some earlier georeferencing documents.\n\nnorthing\n\nWithin a coordinate reference system (e.g. as provided by a GPS or a map grid reference system), the line representing northward distance from a reference latitude.\n\noffset\n\nA displacement from a reference location. Usually used in conjunction with heading to give a distance and direction from a feature.\n\npath\n\nA route or track between one place and another. In some cases the path may cross itself.\n\npersistent identifier (PID)\n\nA long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. The term \"persistent identifier\" is usually used in the context of digital objects accessible over the Internet. There are many options for PIDs, such as Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).\n\npoint-radius\n\nA representation of the geographic component of a location as geographic coordinates and a maximum uncertainty distance. The point-radius georeferencing method produces georeferences that include geographic coordinates, a coordinate reference system, and a maximum uncertainty distance that encompasses all of the possible geographic coordinates where a locality might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the uncertainties within a circle. The point-radius method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (elevation, depth, distance above surface).\n\nprecision\n\nThe closeness of a repeated set of observations of the same quantity to one another – a measure of control over random error.\n\nWith values, it describes the finest unit of measurement used to express that value (e.g. if a record is reported to the nearest second, the precision is 1/3600th of a degree; if a decimal degree is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree).\n\nAntonym: imprecision. Compare accuracy, error, bias, false precision, and uncertainty.\n\nprime meridian\n\nThe set of locations with longitude designated as 0 degrees east and west, to which all other longitudes are referenced. The Greenwich meridian is internationally recognized as the prime meridian for many popular and official purposes.\n\nprojection\n\nA series of transformations that convert the locations of points in a coordinate reference system on a curved surface (the reference surface or datum) to the locations of corresponding points in a coordinate reference system on a flat plane. The datum is an integral part of the projection, as projected coordinate systems are based on geographic coordinates, which are in turn referenced to a geodetic datum. It is possible, and even common for datasets to be in the same projection, but referenced to distinct geodetic datums, and therefore have different coordinate values.\n\nquality\n\nsee data quality.\n\nradial\n\nThe distance from a center point (e.g. the corrected or geographic center) within a location to the furthest point on the outermost boundary of that location. See also geographic radial.\n\nrepatriate, repatriation\n\nThe process of returning something to the source from which it was extracted. In the georeferencing sense, this refers to the process of adding the results of georeferencing to the original data, especially when georeferencing was done by a third party.\n\nrules of interpretation\n\nA documented set of steps to take in order to produce a standardized representation of source information.\n\nSatellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS)\n\nA civil aviation safety-critical system that supports wide-area or regional augmentation through the use of geostationary (GEO) satellites that broadcast the augmentation information (see discussion in section §2.6.4).\n\nshape\n\nSynonym of footprint. A representation of the geographic component of a location as a geometry. The result of a shape georeferencing method includes a shape as the geographic component of the georeference, which contains the set of all possible geographic coordinates where a location might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical uncertainties within the geometry given. The shape method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (elevation, depth, distance above surface).\n\nsmallest enclosing circle\n\na circle with the smallest radius (radial) that contains all of a given set of points (or a given shape) on a surface (see Smallest-circle problem). This is seldom the same as the geographic center, nor the midpoint between two most distant geographic coordinates of a location.\n\nspatial fit\n\na measure of how well one geometric representation matches another geometric representation as a ratio of the area of the larger of the two to the area of the smaller one. (See Figure 14).\n\nspatial reference system\n\nsee coordinate reference system.\n\nstratigraphic section\n\nA local outcrop or series of adjacent outcrops that display a vertical sequence of strata in the order they were deposited.\n\ntransect\n\nA path along which observations, measurements, or samples are made. Transects are often recorded as a starting location and a terminating location.\n\ntrig point\n\nA surveyed reference point, often on high points of elevation (mountain tops, etc.) and usually designated with a fixed marker on a small pyramidal structure or a pillar. The exact location is determined by survey triangulation and hence the alternative names \"trigonometrical point\", \"triangulation point\" or \"benchmark\".\n\nuncertainty\n\nA measure of the incompleteness of one’s knowledge or information about an unknown quantity whose true value could be established if complete knowledge and a perfect measuring device were available (Cullen & Frey 1999). Georeferencing methods codify how to incorporate uncertainties from a variety of sources (including accuracy and precision) in the interpretation of a location. Compare accuracy, error, bias, precision, and false precision.\n\nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM)\n\nA standardized coordinate system based on a metric rectangular grid system and a division of the earth into sixty 6-degree longitudinal zones. The scope of UTM covers from 84° N to 80° S. (See §2.4.2).\n\nvertical datum\n\nA reference surface for vertical positions, such as elevation. Vertical datums fall into several categories, including: tidal, based on sea level; gravimetric, based on a geoid; geodetic, based on ellipsoid models of the Earth; or local, based on a local reference surface. Also known as height datum.\n\nWide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)\n\nAn air navigation aid developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration to augment the Global Positioning System (GPS), with the goal of improving its accuracy, integrity, and availability. See also Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS), of which WAAS is one example.\n\nWGS84\n\nWorld Geodetic System 1984, a popular globally-used horizontal geodetic coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326) upon which raw GPS measurements are based (though a GPS receiver is capable of delivering coordinates in other reference systems). The term is also commonly used for the geodetic datum used by that system and for the ellipsoid (EPSG:7030) upon which that datum (EPSG:6326) is based."
