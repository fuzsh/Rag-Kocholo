        "text": "Cottonwood Wash, is a wide-open rolling high desert, with low rocky bluffs studded with distant towering buttes. This road is well maintained and is generally a safe road to drive. The Buckhorn Wash portion of this route is especially scenic, with canyon walls rising many hundreds of feet above you, Native American rock art panels, a well-preserved dinosaur track and more! There are many side roads along this route, but the navigation of this road is easy-when in doubt, stay on the main road!\n\nMile 28.3 Mile 0\n\nThis is where the Cottonwood Wash Road intersects I-70 and heads north towards Buckhorn Wash.\n\nMile 26.2 Mile 2.1\n\nThis is a Sagebrush test area, used to study the effects of grazing by livestock. The western section of the enclosure was fenced off in 1937, while the eastern section was enclosed in 1961.\n\nMile 23.3 Mile 5.0\n\nYou are at Sinkhole Flat, with the actual sinkhole surrounded by a circular log fence. The sinkhole is of little scenic value, and is included here only as a landmark.\n\nMile 10.8 Mile 17.5\n\nMassive Window Blind Peak is to the east of the road, with the smaller Assembly Hall Peak to the north of Window Blind. Rising to an elevation of 7030 feet, it is the tallest free standing monolith in America, one of the largest in the world. It is called “Window Blind” because some of the rock formations near the top on Northeast side look like windows with the blinds closed. Assembly Hall was named for its resemblance to the original LDS assembly hall in Salt Lake City.\n\nMile 10 Mile 18.3\n\nTo the west, slender Bottleneck Peak rises to an elevation of 6401 feet.above sea level.\n\nMile 9.2 Mile 19.1\n\nThis is the bridge over the San Rafael River, and it is the boundary between Cottonwood Wash and Buckhorn Wash roads. Just to the south of the river is the San Rafael Recreation Area campground, maintained by the Bureau of Land Management. It offers many campsites, picnic tables, fire rings and pit toilets. There is no drinking water available. North of the river are many sandy primitive campsites under the cottonwood trees. The swinging bridge, located to the west, was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1938 and was the only bridge over the river until the early 1990s. Though you can no longer drive on it, it is perfectly safe to walk on.\n\nMile 7.4 Mile 20.9\n\nCalf, Cow and Pine Canyons enter from the East.\n\nMile 5.5 Mile 22.7\n\nOne of the highlights of the entire San Rafael Swell is the mysterious Buckhorn Wash pictograph panel. There are some faint petroglyphs here, but the red pictograph figures are the stars of this site! The main panel was painted over 2,000 years ago by the Barrier Canyon culture. Learn more about the Barrier Canyon culture and how they made pictographs and petroglyphs. There is also a boulder with the names of the same CCC boys that built the swinging bridge over the San Rafael River carved into it. There is a pit toilet at this location.\n\nMile 4.2 Mile 24\n\nOn the sandstone ledge, about 40 feet above the road, is the Matt Warner inscription, dated Feb 17 1920. Matt was a very colorful outlaw that operated (on occasion with Butch Cassidy) from New Mexico to Washington State for over 18 years. During that period, he frequented Green River, operating a saloon and brothel there.\n\nMile 2.3 Mile 25.9\n\nThere is a cattle guard here. Just south of the cattle guard is a parking area. Park there, and notice the trail heading to the east, up a steep hill. There is a large panel of petroglyphs at the end of this short trail.\n\nMile 2.1 Mile 26.1\n\nTo the east of the road a short distance is an interesting petroglyph. It can be hard to spot, so look for a series of bullet holes where some fool shot his initials (TKG) onto the cliff. Look left of those for a large, light colored crack running vertically. The petroglyph is just left of the crack.\n\nMile 1.6 Mile 26.6\n\nA very clear and large dinosaur track can, with a little searching, be found here. On the east side of the road is a ledge of sandstone about 10 to 15 feet above the road. There are several paths up to the ledge. Once on top of the ledge, look for a larger flat area of bare sandstone at your feet. The footprint is on this large sandstone area, although you may have to move some flat rocks to uncover it. Visit the dinosaur pages within our site to learn more about other dinosaurs in Castle Country.\n\nMile 1.4 Mile 26.8\n\nA short canyon is east of the road. There is an easy hike up the canyon.\n\nMile 0 Mile 28.3\n\nYou are at the intersection with the Green River Cutoff Road. West will take you to Castledale and Highway 10, east will lead you to US Highway 6\n\nLocation Of The Wash\n\nThe San Rafael River is the boundary-Buckhorn Wash north of the River, Cottonwood Wash to the south. The southern section, Cottonwood Wash, is a wide-open rolling high desert, with low rocky bluffs studded with distant towering buttes. This road is well maintained and is generally a safe road to drive. The Buckhorn Wash portion of this route is especially scenic, with canyon walls rising many hundreds of feet above you, Native American rock art panels, a well-preserved dinosaur track and more! There are many side roads along this route, but the navigation of this road is easy-when in doubt, stay on the main road!\n\nBelieved to be the work of the BARRIER CANYON CULTURE, the Buckhorn Wash panel is more than 2,000 years old. It predates the Fremont work found in Castle Country. The Barrier Canyon people did not have pottery. They hunted and gathered, used stone and bone tools and atlatls (spear throwers).\n\nDistinctive features of Barrier Canyon\n\nRock Art\n\nlife-sized figures without arms or legs\n\nbroad shoulders, tapered trunks and bug eyes\n\ndots, rays and crowns above heads\n\nfigures accompanied by birds, insects, snakes and dogs\n\nHow these Pictographs were made\n\nPictographs were painted on the surface of rock with natural pigments. Black was made from yellow ochre (a mineral found in the soil), pinyon gum and sumac. When stirred together, they form a black powder. Reds were made from red ochre and the roots of mountain mahogany. Rabbitbrush was a source of yellow. Likely binding agents were plant oils and animal fats. Petroglyphs were carved, pecked or chiseled into the rock.\n\nLikely tools used in making Pictographs and petroglyphs\n\nbrushes made from human hair, dog hair or yucca fibers\n\nflint or other stone chisel and hammers\n\nhollow bird bones filled with pigment\n\nfingers or mouths- paint could be blown out of the mouth and onto the rock creating a negative image often associated with handprints.\n\nVandalism\n\nPaint, chalk, carvings and bullet holes have vandalized the Buckhorn Panel. The canyon’s proximity to the Old Spanish Trail and its use as a hideout for outlaws made the pictograph panel a prime target for vandals. Sadly, much of the damage is permanent and lost art cannot be repaired. However, the Buckhorn Panel was greatly improved in 1995 through an intensive restoration effort. Today vandalism of rock art is illegal and should be reported to law enforcement authorities.\n\nThe Restoration Project\n\nAs part of the 1996 Centennial Celebration citizens of Emery County initiated the restoration of the Buckhorn Panel. This project was a joint effort by citizens, the BLM, Utah and county governments. This site is one of several in the United States that has been restored by Constance Silver, an internationally known art conservator. The clean up took about six weeks at the site.\n\nPlease help preserve the panel by:\n\nlooking with your eyes, not your hands\n\nreporting vandals to the BLM or local Sheriff\n\nFollow This Map to locate the panels\n\nThis part of Utah is always a diversion to take a look at through camping season.

The beautiful paved Highway 89 that we now enjoy was just a dirt road. The black and dirty cave had been abused and mistreated and was filled with graffiti and black stains from campfires within the cave.\n\nGarth had a vision not shared by many of his time. He went to the bank for financing and everyone thought he was crazy. They refused to lend him money for his project. Garth and his wife decided to go ahead with their plans anyway and began to clean up the cave. They started with 286 bags of Portland cement which they mixed in a small fruit sprayer. The couple put a clean white coat of paint over the interior of the entire cave. They commented that they got more on themselves than on the cave.\n\nThe paint was followed by 150 truckloads of dirt. The floors slanted badly, so the dirt was used to level the floors and entry.\n\nConcrete, 7,000 square feet to be exact, was poured over the dirt to create a smooth floor. This concrete was not delivered in cement trucks, each load had to be hand mixed and pushed in a wheelbarrow to its destination.\n\nA stage was built to provide room for an orchestra and the cave was ready. The first use of the cave was for dances and socials. A bar was also set up in the south wing of the cave.\n\nFollowing years of long Friday and Saturday nights, Garth and his wife decided to discontinue the dances and bar and to turn the cave into a museum.\n\nMuseum pieces were acquired. Replicas of the ruins in the local area were added. Dinosaur tracks were found and brought to the cave. A fluorescent mineral display was created and has become one of the largest collections in the west.\n\nThe cave today represents forty years of painstaking work; work begun with a vision. Garth and his wife could not have imagined their success, nor the enjoyment others would find in their work\n\nThe Moqui CaveLex was not around when his father, Garth Chamberlain, purchased the cave (7 miles north of Kanab) in 1951.

Gently carved from the Navajo sandstone over the course of countless millenniums, the slot canyons are majestic and narrow passages, just enough space for a small group to walk the sandy floor – and for the occasional shafts of sunlight to shine down from above.\n\nIt is really two separate canyons – Upper and Lower Antelope. Each contains the hidden “slots” carved from the swirling sandstone, and both drain from the south into Lake Powell (once the Colorado River). The canyons are so narrow in places that one can stretch out his or her arms and touch both sides.\n\nThe Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is Tse’ bighanilini, which means “the place where water runs through rocks.” Upper Antelope is at about 4,000 feet elevation and the canyon walls rise 120 feet above the streambed. Lower Antelope Canyon is Hasdestwazi, or “spiral rock arches.” Both are located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation.\n\nThough dry most of the year, Antelope Canyon runs, and sometimes floods, with water after rains. It is the water, slowly wearing away the sandstone grain by grain, that has formed the beautiful and graceful curves in the rock. Wind has also played a role in sculpting this fantastic canyon.\n\nYou must have an authorized guide to Upper and Lower areas of Antelope Canyon. You can contact one of the outfitters below, to make reservations.\n\nHISTORY\n\nA long time ago, herds of pronghorn antelope roamed freely in Antelope Canyon, which explains the canyon’s English name. It is not known exactly when people first discovered Antelope Canyon. According to local Navajos, who have lived here for some time, the canyon and the LeChee area were places where cattle grazed in winter.\n\nTo older Navajos, entering a place like Antelope Canyon was like entering a cathedral. They would probably pause before going in, to be in the right from of mind and prepare the protection and respect. This would also allow them to leave with an uplifted feeling of what Mother Nature has to offer, and to be in harmony with something greater than themselves.

(You might see some 3-toed dino footprints during your walks in Angel Canyon.) The earliest humans came to Angel Canyon about 11,000 years ago.\n\nSeven locations in the canyon are noted for their beauty and the atmosphere of peace and healing that emanates from them. The first is Petroglyph Rock.\n\nThe figures on the wall of Petroglyph Rock were carved about a thousand years ago by people known as the Anasazi or Hisatzanome.\n\nNobody has completely deciphered the meaning of all the petroglyphs (carvings) and pictographs (paintings) of the Anasazi. But they share a unique characteristic when compared to the rock art of almost every other ancient civilization of the world. Nowhere, among all the pictures and carvings, will you ever see a depiction of war, violence, slavery, subjugation, or any other form of aggression.\n\nOn the popular TV show, the Lone Ranger and Tonto took refuge in Angels Landing, a huge dome-shaped cave of red sandstone at the heart of Angel Canyon.\n\nBut long before the Lone Ranger or, indeed, any other European settlers came here, Angels Landing had been a sacred gathering place for thousands of years. Nearby, you can see evidence of people who settled here more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nUnderground Lake\n\nA short path at the top of the pasture leads down sharply to a cave full of dark, still, chilly water that quickly curves around and goes out of sight. Bats nest in the cracks of the rock over the lake during the day, then swarm out at sundown.\n\nAngel’s Rest\n\nThe entrance gate depicts a dog and cat with rabbits perched on their backs, surrounded by flowers in bloom. Colorful rocks form walls that hold urns, vases, and memorials. Stones and markers proclaim, “Always in our hearts,” “The best wee cat in the whole wide world,” and other loving sentiments.\n\nAnimal statues dot the landscape – a napping cat, a smiling sheepdog, an elegant owl, and many others\n\nAnasazi Kiva\n\na kiva, a small circular building, built partially underground, in one of the caves that was home to a community of the Anasazi people.\n\nThe kiva was the heart of the community – most likely a ceremonial room where the people would gather on special days for prayer or purification.\n\nHandprint Cave\n\nFaint petroglyphs (carvings in the stone) and pictographs (paintings) decorate the walls of this cave home. The paint is red and yellow, colors that were painstakingly distilled from the iron oxide that gives the cliffs those same colors.\n\nBut your attention is immediately, almost hypnotically, drawn to the handprints.\n\nThey’re quite small. Perhaps the hands of a young person, although the adults were not large people and the prints have been carefully placed on the walls with no smudges.\n\nDinosaur Traces\n\nNear the caves, millions of years earlier, a family of dinosaurs walked by and left their huge, three-toed footprints in the red sand one rainy day. The sand dried and the prints remained.\n\nFrom Kanab\n\nThe entrance to Best Friends is about five miles north of Kanab on the east (right) side of Hwy 89. Between the 69 and 70 mile markers, a green highway sign indicates Kanab Canyon. Turn into Kanab Canyon and drive about 1.5 miles to the Welcome Center, which is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. seven days a week."
