This can be slightly confusing, as evidenced by traveling north along State St in Roosevelt. Proceeding north from Lagoon St, after a few blocks you will hit 500 N (City), then 600 N (City) and then 500 N (County).

There is also no official address origin. If there was an\n\norigin, it would be where Zion Park Blvd (SR 9) meets the north city boundary line, which is also the border of Zion National Park. Zion Park Blvd (ZPB) would be the zero road, where addresses along the cross streets get larger as they get farther away from ZPB. But there is no standard of how far addresses count; the addresses could jump by 2 from house to house or by 50. All segments of ZPB have S as the prefix directional, since the origin would be the north city boundary. E-911 is uses address points for Springdale.
