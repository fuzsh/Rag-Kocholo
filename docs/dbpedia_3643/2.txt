On April 21, 2024 08:04:39 an earthquake with magnitude of 0.97 on the richter scale hit 6 km NE of Enterprise, Utah. The earthquake originated at a depth of approximately 10.02 kilometers below the Earth's surface on longitude -111.689° and latitude 41.141°. According to documented reports people felt the earth quake, No tsunami was triggered due to the earthquake.

Magnitude & Depth

The earthquake that appeared on April 21, 2024 08:04:39 had a magnitude of 0.97 on the richter scale.

Shallow earthquakes are considered between 0 and 70 km deep, while intermediate earthquakes range from 70 - 300 km deep and deep earthquakes are between 300 - 700 km deep.

Are shallow earthquakes more destructive?

Shallow quakes generally tend to be more damaging than deeper quakes. Seismic waves from deep quakes have to travel farther to the surface, losing energy along the way.

Nearby Cities and Towns

The nearest significant population center is Mountain Green in Utah, United States, located 8 kilometers or 5 miles ← W of the earthquake's epicenter. Other cities in close proximity include Morgan (Utah, United States) located 11 km (7 mi) ↘ SE and Morgan County (Utah, United States) located 11 km (7 mi) → E of the epicenter.

In total, we found 65 cities in our database that might have been impacted by the earthquake.

Nearby Power Plants

We found a total 18 utility-scale power plants in the vecinity of the earthquakes epicenter. Ranging form closest to furtherst, one of these is a neaclear power plant.

Power Plants & Risks During Earthquakes

We found 4 types of power plants in the vecinity of the magnitude 0.97 earthquake that struck 6 km NE of Enterprise, Utah on April 21, 2024 08:04:39. These types were Hydro power plants, Solar power plants, Waste power plants, Gas power plants, below you find information how each type of power plant can pose a risk to you as a person or the ecosytem around you.

None of this information should be used as guidence in an event of an emergency, but rather as additional references to information provided by national, state and local authorities.

Hydropower

Hydropower plants are generally considered as safe in many aspects, but when it comes to severe earthquakes they pose a substantial risk that can manifest in the form of dam faliours, landslides and grave impacts on surrounding ecosystems.

Dam Failure

The most significant risk is the potential failure of the dam that holds the water reservoir. Severe ground shaking can damage or breach the dam, leading to downstream flooding and as a result endangering people and wildlife living downstream. Such an event can also have severe impact on key infrastructure that cascades through society.

Landslides

Earthquakes can trigger landslides in the areas surrounding hydropower plants, potentially damaging infrastructure and causing harm to nearby communities.

Damage to Aquatic Ecosystems

Both landslide and dam failures can have a severe impact on upstream and downstream aquatic wildlife, ecosystem and groundwater, resulting in longterm risks for people and industires living and operating in areas near the water supply.

To mitigate these risks, engineering and construction standards for hydropower plants often include earthquake-resistant designs. These designs incorporate measures such as flexible foundations, strengthened dam structures, and advanced monitoring systems to detect early signs of stress. Additionally, emergency plans and evacuation procedures should be in place to protect personnel and downstream communities in the event of a severe earthquake.

Gas Power

Gas power plants can pose significant risks to people and the environment in their vicinity during earthquakes.

Gas Leaks and Fires

Gas power plants rely on natural gas, which can leak from pipelines and equipment when damaged by seismic activity. These leaks can lead to fires and explosions, endangering people in the plant's vicinity.

Impact on Air Quality

Gas power plants emit pollutants, and fires caused by gas leaks during an earthquake can release harmful substances into the air. This can pose health risks to nearby residents.

Environmental Impact

Gas leaks can also harm the local environment, potentially contaminating soil and water sources.

To mitigate these risks, most modern gas power plants have robust safety measures in place, including gas leak detection systems, emergency response plans, and communication protocols to alert nearby communities in case of an incident. Additionally, local authorities should conduct risk assessments and ensure that emergency services are well-prepared to respond to potential hazards posed by gas power plants during earthquakes.

Solar Power

Solar power plants generally pose fewer risks compared to conventional power plants that use fossil fuels or nuclear energy. However, they are not without their own set of potential risks and challenges. Below you can find some of the risks associated with solar power plants in an event of a severe earthquake.

Environmental Impact

The production of solar panels involves the use of various materials, including rare metals and chemicals. Severe earthquakes could potentially introduce these into the ecosystems of their location.

Fire Risk

Although the solar panels themselves are not typically a fire hazard, electrical components like inverters and batterises that store the electricity can pose a risk. Electrical malfunctions or faults can lead to fires, especially in poorly maintained systems in an event of a severe earthquake, and thus pose a longterm risk for the local ecosystem.

Overall, the mitigation of risks associated with utility-scale solar power plants involves a combination of technological advancements, sustainable practices, regulatory adherence, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance.
