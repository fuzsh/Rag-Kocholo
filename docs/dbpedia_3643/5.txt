HISTORY

This is the oldest house in Enterprise. It was first built in Hebron by Elias Hunt and Aluna Terry Hunt about 1874 . Some years later there was a conflict over water rights, and the matter was taken to church court in St George. It was decided that the Hebron people who owned the water rights should move down to Enterprise where there was more land. They should share in the land and water together. The year was 1906, and my father, who was the youngest, was 2 years old. So my obedient grandparents immediately moved to the new Enterprise townsite and lived in a tent with their large family until spring. Then they dismantled their home in Hebron, salvaging bricks, rough sawn lumber, doors, windows, stoves, and everything, even the square nails and moved it all down the canyon with horses and wagons to the new town of Enterprise. They then re-built their home on the corner where it is still standing.
