They grabbed their scissors and cut away everyone else from the pictures but this lovely young Italian girl carrying two large bags.\n\nAs chance would have it, the one that filled the pages in the movie mags was Pier Angeli’s twin sister Marisa Pavan. She was a pale and quiet and downhearted girl who already missed Rome and her boyfriend Franco. But Mama Angeli took the whole family when Pier, her pride and joy, was going to be a star in the great land in the west.\n\nAnd Marisa was bound to follow orders,once more she went to the quiet, dark, little cinema around the corner, held Franco’s hand and for the last time she took her farewell with him in the hallway a night when everything seamed to fall apart inside her. And the next day she had to help Pier with her hair, her luggage, and all the other small but important things for her great arrival in the Mecca of movies.\n\nHollywood was scary and strange for the shy Marisa, she hid in the shadow of her famous sister, she seldom went out and made herself as small and gray as she felt. Until the day a famous photographer had a few frames left when doing a shoot at the Angeli home and decided to take a few pictures. of the whole family. His editor fell head over heels for the young, shy girl in the corner of the large sofa and sent the photographer back with strict orders to take more pictures of Marisa, just Marisa.\n\nAnd the telephone at the Angeli residence started chiming, it was film producers that wanted her to test shoot and it was the most sought after young men in Beverly Hills that wanted to date Marisa. And it was magazine editors and television producers who fought each other over the new face that everyone wanted to see more of.\n\nAnd the telephone at the Angeli residence started chiming, it was film producers that wanted her to test shoot and it was the most sought after young men in Beverly Hills that wanted to date Marisa.

She made her unforgettable debut in \"The \"Tattooed Rose\" and her success was the kind that no one can explain, but we all wish the ones that deserves it.\n\nAnd she even found a new man to share her new and exiting future with, she married the French actor Jean Pierre Aumont on a beautiful spring day."
