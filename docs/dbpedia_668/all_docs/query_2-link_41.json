        "text": "Barbara Hutton and Baron Gottfried von Cramm\n\nNow if that checkered coat isn't fit for a honeymoon, we don't know what is. Barbara Hutton was proudly wearing it while locking arms with her newest husband at the time, German tennis player Baron Gottfried von Cramm. They had just landed at Idlewild Airport after tying the knot in Paris.\n\nThey were on their way to Mexico at the time. But things simply didn't work out between the two in the long run and the couple would ultimately divorce. In fact, von Cramm was just one of seven other men who Hutton would end up getting married to during her lifetime.\n\nIngrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini\n\nThere are some locations that are just perfect for honeymoon photos. This one was taken in 1950 in Venice, Italy. Here, we can see Swedish film star Ingrid Bergman hanging out on a balcony at the Venetian Grand Hotel with her husband Roberto Rossellini. Bergman had previously been married to Dr. Peter Lindstrom.\n\nBut her affair with Rossellini was well documented, having first ignited their romance during the filming of the movie \"Stromboli.\" Eventually, Bergman and Lindstrom divorced and she shacked up with Rossellini. Despite having a son and twin daughters, the couple's marriage wasn't easy, and Rossellini's reported infidelity ultimately led to their divorce in 1957.\n\nJoe DiMaggio and Dorothy DiMaggio\n\nIt should go as no surprise that the very best baseball players have had varying levels of success in the love department. Joe DiMaggio is no exception. The New York Yankee can be seen here enjoying his honeymoon with his newlywed wife Dorothy.\n\nThe couple met back in 1937 and after just two years together, they announced their engagement to the world. They married the same year, and it wasn't long before the lovebirds had a son. Joseph Jr. was born in 1941. However, DiMaggio's service in the military during World War II put a strain on their marriage and the couple ultimately went their separate ways in 1944.\n\nPeggy Lee and Brad Dexter\n\nWhen we get married, we're saying goodbye to a previous chapter of our lives and saying hello to a new one. And that's exactly what Warner Bros. star Peggy Lee did with her new husband, Brad Dexter, as they set foot on the Super Chief to embark on their honeymoon in New York and Washington.\n\nLee has previously been married to guitarist/composer Dave Barbour. Eventually, though, she moved on and tied the knot with Dexter. But after claiming that he didn't work, Lee decided to part ways with Dexter after less than a year together. She got married and divorced two more times in her life.\n\nTommy Dorsey and Jane New\n\nIt's definitely kind of strange to see a bandleader like Tommy Dorsey dressed the way he is in this photo. The jazz musician was enjoying a wonderful honeymoon with his wife Jane New. Here, they can be seen boarding a yacht in Miami Beach. The couple tied the knot in 1948.\n\nJane had been a dancer at the Copacabana nightclub and we can only suspect that the two met in this venue. Tommy and Jane ended up enjoying eight years of marriage together. During that time, they had two kids together. Sadly though, Dorsey passed away in 1956 not too long after his 51st birthday.\n\nMartha O'Driscoll and Richard D. Adams\n\nIf you could define the word \"happiness\" with a photo, then this must surely be it. And yet, it wasn't entirely reflective of the years that would follow for these two newlyweds. Actress Martha O'Driscoll and her first husband Lieutenant Commander Richard D. Adams had a wonderful honeymoon after tying the knot in 1943.\n\nAnd this photo was taken shortly after. Sadly though, their love would essentially only lasted ten months, albeit their divorce proceedings would have to be put on the back burner due to Adams's involvement in World War II. Even though Adams did not agree to the divorce, O'Driscoll eventually got her way in 1947.\n\nBillie Dove and Robert Kenaston\n\nA couple of newlyweds holding hands has never looked more heartwarming. Just days after tying the knot, Hollywood star Billie Dove and real estate entrepreneur Robert Kenaston were spotted having an intimate moment together during their honeymoon. They stayed at the Desert Inn in Palm Springs, California.\n\nDove had wrapped up her final film \"Blondie of the Follies\" and was excited to focus on her personal life. And it was a great decision, as Dove and Kenaston would enjoy 35 blissful years of marriage together, up until the latter's passing in 1970. The couple was survived by their son Robert Alan Kenaston Jr.\n\nClark Gable and Carole Lombard\n\nIs there a man in Hollywood more renowned for stealing hearts than the one and only Clark Gable? In this photo, the iconic actor can be seen still with his long hair which he grew it out for his career-defining role in \"Gone With the Wind.\"\n\nAt the time, Gable had recently tied the knot with Carole Lombard and the couple can be seen having fun during their honeymoon at a Golf Course in Del Monte, California. The man next to them is British polo player Eric Tyrrell-Martin. By all accounts, it was a very happy time in Gable's life. Tragically though, Lombard ended up passing in a plane crash in 1942, breaking Gable's heart in the process.\n\nJohnny Weissmueller and Bobbe Arnst\n\nPhotos don't always tell the entire story. While these two certainly appeared to be head over heels for each other, it ultimately wouldn't last. Swimming champion Johnny Weissmueller can be seen here romantically kissing his wife Bobbe Arnst during their honeymoon in Miami, Florida.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Weissmueller was married a whopping five times - and this was the first time he tied the knot. But it was simply a fleeting moment in an otherwise doomed marriage. Their relationship ended up lasting only two years. However, his fifth marriage (to Maria Gertrude Baumann) ended up lasting all the way up until his passing in 1984.\n\nJack Dempsey and Hannah Williams\n\nEven boxers deserve a shot at love at some point in their careers - and the same can be said for the legendary performer Jack Dempsey. Kid Blackie, as he was known in the ring, was married on four separate occasions in his life. In this photo, he can be seen with his third wife, Hannah Williams.\n\nShe was also famous in her own right, having been a Broadway singer and also having divorced from Roger Wolfe Kahn. The Manssa Mauler, as he was also known, took his newlywed wife sailing during their honeymoon. Despite having two children, the couple ended up going their separate ways in 1943.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nJust like any normal person, world leaders also deserve the right to have an enjoyable honeymoon. And that's exactly what former president Franklin D. Roosevelt did after he married his fifth cousin, Eleanor, in 1905. The couple can be seen here enjoying their honeymoon in Italy.\n\nHowever, their marriage was tarnished due to the multiple affairs that FDR would end up having - most notably with Eleanor's social secretary. While the romance fizzled out, the couple stayed together for political reasons. And Eleanor decided to live away from Franklin, even when his health started to deteriorate. The president also had a relationship with Lucy Mercer while still married to Eleanor.\n\nDoris Duke and Porfirio Rubirosa\n\nAt one point known as the richest girl in the world, Doris Duke found a new kind of wealth when she tied the knot with Porfirio Rubirosa in September 1947 in Paris. It turns out that they also spent their honeymoon in the French capital, where this photo was taken.\n\nRubirosa had paid his ex-wife a lot of money before marrying Duke. But he would have to end up doing the same thing just a year later. Despite all of the ostentatious displays of wealth and gifts, the couple parted ways in 1948 and Duke remained unmarried for the rest of her life.\n\nMarie Curie and Pierre Curie\n\nHere we can see the iconic chemists Pierre and Marie Curie standing next to some bikes during their honeymoon. The two started things off professionally as their scientific careers blossomed in Paris. Although they were hesitant to make things romantic, they eventually were besotted with each other and it was just a matter of time before Pierre said yes to Marrie.\n\nWhile Pierre got his doctorate and Marie pursued her Ph.D., the couple ended up tying the knot in 1895. And their deep love for science (and each other) continued until the very end when Pierre passed away in 1906.\n\nJudy Garland and Vincente Minnelli\n\nIn 1945, Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli had a honeymoon fit for two superstars. After their grand wedding in Hollywood, the pair jetted off to New York City, where they spent a romantic few weeks. With Broadway theater shows, luxury accommodations, fine dining experiences, and lots of sightseeing, it's no wonder why this celebrity couple chose NYC as their destination.\n\nJudy was already a rising star, having skyrocketed to fame with her role in “The Wizard of Oz” and “Meet Me in St. Louis,” while Vincente was a renowned film director who had helmed hits like “Cabin in the Sky” and “Yolanda and the Thief.”\n\nRita Hayworth and Orson Welles\n\nOrson Welles and Rita Hayworth flew to Acapulco for their second honeymoon in 1946. The stars separated for a short period and decided to celebrate their reunion in Mexico. Neither were strangers to fame — Orson was known for his iconic “Citizen Kane” and “The Third Man,” while Rita was an image of glamor thanks to her sultry performance in “Gilda.”\n\nAbove, we see the Hollywood couple boarding a flight to Mexico, where they split their time between relaxing at Errol Flynn’s yacht and filming “Lady of Shanghai.” Truth be told, there might not be a more iconic pair of Hollywood stars on this list who ended up going on a honeymoon together.\n\nJoe Dassin and Christine Delvaux\n\nHave you ever seen a more passionate photo than the one of Joe Dassin and his wife, Christine Delvaux, below? We doubt you have. Truth be told - this is like a shot taken out of \"The Notebook\" or one of the romantic dramas of the last 30 years. And yet, it was taken back in the '70s!\n\nIn 1977, French singer-songwriter Joe Dassin and his wife Christine Delvaux decided to honeymoon on the stunning island of Martinique — a fitting choice for the couple that had been head-over-heels in love since they first met. Joe was known for his romantic ballads, while Christine was a beautiful actress who starred in several classic French films.\n\nColin Petersen and Joanne Newfield\n\nBee Gee’s drummer Colin Petersen and Canadian businesswoman Joanne Newfield got married in 1968 and left for their honeymoon eleven days after the ceremony. The young couple got married in The Bahamas and had their honeymoon in Majorca, Spain. Clearly, these two were beach lovers and wanted to make the most of the good weather on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Australian-born drummer and his wife wanted some peace and quiet for a few weeks, so they kept their honeymoon dates a secret from the press. And guess what? Unlike so many other honeymooners on this list - this couple remains married to this day!\n\nErrol Flynn and Lili Damita\n\nErrol Flynn was one of the real playboys of his time. So it makes sense that the actor and Lili Damita had a whirlwind romance in 1936 before they tied the knot. The famous actors are seen below about to board a plane for Los Angeles, where they spent their honeymoon.\n\nWhile Errol was an up-and-coming actor, his career hadn't yet reached a fever pitch of success as it later would. As for Lili, although her background was firmly rooted in French aristocracy, she'd chosen to pursue a career in film. Unfortunately, they had a very messy divorce in 1942, which was detailed in Flynn’s autobiography years later.\n\nRingo Starr and Maureen Cox\n\nLegendary drummer of The Beatles, Ringo Starr, met hairdresser Maureen Cox at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, England, in the early 1960s. The young couple wed in 1965 and had an unforgettable honeymoon in Sussex. Below we see the glamorous lovebirds strolling hand in hand in a beautiful countryside garden.\n\nThe house they stayed at in Princes Crescent in Sussex was actually a loan from a friend. It was situated at Hove, Sussex, and had stunning seafront views and jaw-dropping mountain landscapes – a perfect way to escape the stressful hounding of the press. In the end, the couple were married for 10 years.\n\nDebbie Reynolds and Richard Hamlett\n\nAmerican actress Debbie Reynolds rose to fame for her roles in “Singin’ in the Rain” and “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.” In 1984, she got married for the third time to successful businessman and developer Richard Hamlett, and their union lasted for 12 happy years.\n\nAbove, we see the very happy couple about to set sail on a romantic cruise trip to the Caribbean for their honeymoon. Their wedding ceremony was a small and tasteful affair at the home of a mutual friend in Miami Beach. Wedding in Miami? Honeymoon in the Caribbean? Now that is a combo package that we can definitely get behind.\n\nFarrah Fawcett and Lee Majors\n\nThe beautiful “Charlie’s Angel” Farrah Fawcett was a huge celebrity back in the 70s, and so was her husband, Lee Majors. The young couple tied the knot in 1973, had a brief separation, and remarried in 1977. Below we see the handsome lovebirds at the Los Angeles airport ready to fly off to their second honeymoon.\n\nIn a love story that seemed straight out of a movie, Fawcett and Majors were introduced by Lee’s publicist. They met for coffee and fell for each other almost instantly, and even though they divorced after nine years of marriage, they always remained good friends.\n\nTamara Lees and Fulvio Tiberio Vergari\n\nTamara Lees was an Austrian-born English woman who graduated from Oxford University with a degree in Mathematics, but her true passion was most certainly acting. Her first husband, Fulvio Tiberio Vergari, was an Italian assistant production manager of a prestigious film company. They ended up getting married in 1953.\n\nIn the photo above, we can see the newlyweds posing for a photo before leaving for their Italian Riviera honeymoon. The couple explored the beautiful coastline of Liguria, Portofino, and dozens of other romantic destinations in Italy. And we're sure they had their fair share of pizza and pasta along the way.\n\nYvonne De Carlo and Bob Morgan\n\nYvonne De Carlo was an iconic actress, singer, and dancer of the 1940s and 50s, best known for her role as Lily in “The Munsters.” She met stuntman Bob Morgan in the early 50s, and the two tied the knot in 1955 in a surprise wedding in Reno, Nevada, where the photo below was taken.\n\nOne thing was for sure, De Carlo definitely dressed a bit more normally compared to the role she was used to playing. The actress and the stuntman had a happy marriage that lasted nearly 20 years, and they had two children. That is not bad for a Hollywood marriage.\n\nFrances Dee and Joel McCrea\n\nFrances Dee and Joel McCrea, both very successful actors in the 1930s, spent their honeymoon on the gorgeous beaches of Southern California in 1934. Dee was known for her roles in films such as \"I Walked With a Zombie\" and \"Little Women,\" while McCrea was recognized for his performances in \"Sullivan's Travels\" and \"Foreign Correspondent.\"\n\nThe couple's honeymoon was a romantic getaway to the sun and sands of California and a much-needed break from the hectic pace of Hollywood. The photo above shows the happy and blissful newlyweds in Santa Monica, California, after eloping for their wedding. They even got to play some sports while they were out there.\n\nSean Connery and Diane Cilento\n\nRegardless of how many actors have played the legendary James Bond over the years, there has been no one like Scottish gentleman Sean Connery. After his first portrayal of Bond in 1962’s “Dr. No,” Connery rose to fame, but before becoming a worldwide celebrity, he starred in “Another Time, Another Place,” where he met actress Diane Cilento.\n\nThe couple married in 1962, in a secret wedding in Gibraltar, and then jetted off to beautiful Marbella for their honeymoon. They had a child together, actor Jason Joseph, but sadly, it wasn't a forever match, and the two decided to call it quits in 1973.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher had a whirlwind romance that began in 1958 and ended in a scandalous wedding in 1959. The celebrity couple caused quite a stir, as it ended Debbie Reynolds’ marriage to Eddie. Reynolds also happened to be best friends with Elizabeth Taylor. So there is no denying that there was drama galore in this little corner of Hollywood.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t seem to have affected the young couple’s joy while walking through the streets of St. Tropez on their honeymoon. They traveled through the Mediterranean on a friend’s yacht for several weeks. Unfortunately, their marriage only lasted five years.\n\nJean-Pierre Aumont and Marisa Pavan\n\nJean-Pierre Aumont was a famous French actor that made his name after starring in big films like “Les Miserables” and “The Red Balloon.” He met gorgeous Italian actress Marisa Pavan in the early 50s, and as they say, the rest was history. The couple would end up getting married in 1956.\n\nIn the photo above, we can see the joyous newlyweds enjoying a private moment together while on their honeymoon in Ischia, Italy. The couple stayed together until 1963, were apart for six years, and then remarried in 1969. And it was a case of second time's a charm because they remained married until Aumont's passing in 2001.\n\nGlynis Johns and David Foster\n\nFamous British actress Glynis Johns is captured on camera in a UK airport alongside her new husband David Foster as they return from a romantic honeymoon in 1952. Johns rose to fame for her roles in movies like “Mary Poppins” and “The Court Jester.”\n\nFoster, on his part, was an accomplished American composer and arranger who worked with artists of the topmost caliber like Barbra Streisand and Michael Jackson. Foster was her second husband, and unfortunately, their union only lasted four years. But based on this photo alone, it looks like the newlyweds were pretty excited to get their marriage started.\n\nLenny Henry and Dawn French\n\nBeloved British comedians Lenny Henry and Dawn French got married in 1984. At the time, both had established successful careers as rising stars on British television. Lenny had already garnered acclaim for his work on BBC's “The Fosters and Tiswas,” while Dawn was beginning to make a name for herself by writing for and appearing on various comedy shows.\n\nAbove, we see the happy newlyweds returning from a romantic honeymoon in 1984. French and Henry stayed together for 26 long years and had a child together. These two also went on to produce some of Britain's most beloved comedic moments.\n\nDiana Rigg and Menachem Gueffen\n\nIn true 70s fashion, actress Diana Rigg and artist Menachem Gueffen pose for a photo in Heathrow Airport before flying off to their honeymoon in Los Angeles, California. They got married in 1973. But ultimately, the marriage was not meant to last and the two went their separate ways three years later.\n\nAt the time of their marriage, Diana was a renowned British actress known for her work in the classic television series “The Avengers.” Later on in life, she would go on to have a recurring role in HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" as Olenna Tyrell. Menachem was an Israeli-born painter who illustrated numerous books, including the translated-to-Hebrew version of \"Robinson Crusoe.\"\n\nAnn Miller and William Moss\n\nNever has there been a more festive and joyful photo than that of Ann Miller and William Moss celebrating at the Trevi Fountain in Rome on their honeymoon in 1959. The American actress and the wealthy oilman got married in 1958 and jetted off to Italy for their romantic vacation.\n\nMiller rose to fame for starring in Hollywood musicals during the 1940s and 50s, and even though her marriage to Moss only lasted three years, the newlyweds certainly seemed happy on their honeymoon! As you can see, the couple were throwing pennies behind their shoulders to make some wishes upon their holy matrimony.\n\nJosephine Baker and Jo Bouillon\n\nJosephine Baker made history when she became the first African American woman to appear in a major motion picture in 1927. Apart from her talents as an actress, Baker was also a beautiful dancer. This American-born French performer married orchestra chief Jo Bouillon all the way back in 1937.\n\nFor their honeymoon, the young couple went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, after a fairytale wedding in a small French village. And let's face it, BA is basically the Paris of South America - so they kept things classy. Above, we see the couple posing and Baker giving the camera a huge smile while dining with her hubby at an Argentinian luxury hotel.\n\nTallulah Bankhead and John Emery\n\nAmerican actress Tallulah Bankhead rose to fame all the way back in the 1920s. This was mainly in part due to her flamboyant lifestyle and captivating performances on stage. Bankhead then made her way to the screen, going on to star in big Hollywood films, including Alfred Hitchcock’s “Lifeboat.”\n\nIn 1937, the beautiful young actress married Broadway actor and director John Emery at her father’s home in Alabama. For their honeymoon, the young couple flew to the beautiful sea town of Norwalk, Connecticut. It might not be the most exotic place in the world, but it sure is beautiful there.\n\nPrincess Grace and Prince Rainier III\n\nOften considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, Grace Kelly rose to fame in the early 1950s by starring in hit films like “Rear Window” and “High Noon”. The actress was the epitome of beauty and grace, a status that was further cemented when she became an actual royal after marrying Prince Rainier III.\n\nThe couple got married in Monaco in 1956 and went on a 7-week cruise around the Mediterranean. Above, we see the lovebirds dancing on their honeymoon in Majorca, Spain. Prince Rainier had always refused to dance with Kelly because she was taller than him, but apparently, that thought faded away quickly.\n\nArlene Dahl and Fernando Lamas\n\nThey say that good things come to those who wait, and that was most certainly the case as far as famous classic Hollywood actors Arlene Dahl and Fernando Lamas were concerned. This newlywed couple had to wait two years after their wedding to finally enjoy their honeymoon. They flew off to Rome to celebrate their union in 1956.\n\nAbove, we see the smiling couple enjoying the Roman sun by a beautiful Church. Since they had to wait two long years to go on their honeymoon due to work contracts holding them back, they took an especially long holiday through Italy. Good for them!\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Mike Todd\n\nThe iconic Elizabeth Taylor was known for her looks, her talent, and her long list of husbands. Her third beau was theater producer Mike Todd, whom she married in 1957. Below we see the gorgeous actress in a classic black bathing suit while on her honeymoon with Todd in Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nDespite the beautiful wedding and romantic honeymoon to exciting Mexico, the couple only lasted a year, when Todd sadly passed away in a plane crash in 1958. Taylor didn’t spend too much time as a bachelorette, marrying Eddie Fisher in 1959. In fact, she was married a whopping eight times.\n\nTony Wright and Janet Munro\n\nBoth Tony Wright and Janet Munro were talented British actors. Wright starred in several French films, and Munro starred in the 50s and 60s hit films “Darby O'Gill and the Little People” and “Life for Ruth”. The couple married in 1956 and set off for the romantic city of Paris to start their new lives as husband and wife.\n\nThe happy couple spent two weeks enjoying the vibrant city before returning home. Above we see the star-crossed lovers sitting by the Seine River. It's amazing to think how many couples have had such memorable moments on this iconic river since. Sadly, their marriage only lasted three years.\n\nPrincess Ira Virginia Furstenberg and Prince Alfonso Hohenlohe-Langenburg\n\nWealthy Spanish businessman Prince Alfonso Hohenlohe-Langenburg was 31 years old when he married 15-year-old Princess Ira Virginia Furstenberg. Now before we say anything else, let's just stay the absolute obvious here - how can two newlyweds have such ridiculously long names?! Now that we got that out the way - below are the newlyweds honeymooning in Italy by Lake Garda.\n\nThe couple got married in Venice and then moved to Mexico to begin their lives as husband and wife. They stayed together for five years and had two children. Known for her astonishing beauty, Princess Ira also made a name for herself as an actress, jewelry designer, and PR manager for some of fashion’s most sought-after brands.\n\nBrigitte Bardot and Jacques Charrier\n\nBrigitte Bardot and Jacques Charrier were both very famous in their own rights — Bardot was an iconic actress in the 50s, while Charrier was an acclaimed actor, producer, and artist. After getting married on June 18th, 1959, the beautiful blonde and the handsome fella left for a small seaside village in France to spend their honeymoon.\n\nAbove, we see the lovebirds looking out from their balcony in the home they stayed for several weeks on their romantic vacation. We feel like maybe, just maybe - the couple had no idea that they were having their photo taken. There's a good chance that they were simply staring out into the sunset and the cameraman got lucky.\n\nEddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds\n\nEddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds were one of Hollywood’s golden couples of the 50s. Eddie was a famous singer who gained international success with hit songs such as \"Oh, My Papa,\" and Debbie was an established Broadway star that later became a beloved American actress. She rose to fame after starring in the 1950’s film “Three Little Words.”\n\nAfter tying the knot in 1955, Debbie and Eddie flew off to Florida for a romantic honeymoon under the sun. Above, we see the young couple ready for a day of water skiing and beach cocktails. Of course, they would go on to have their fair share of problems later on.\n\nVic Damone and Pier Angeli\n\nSinger Vic Damone and Italian actress Pier Angeli had an unforgettable honeymoon in Las Vegas after their marriage in 1954, to say the very least. The two actually met through mutual friends, but their relationship really took off after Vic performed “More Than You Know” for Pier at a dinner party.\n\nTo celebrate their marriage, the couple jetted off to Las Vegas, where the photo above was taken. Apart from the casinos, the parties, and all the usual attractions, the couple chose Las Vegas because Vic was scheduled to sing at a resort on the same week of the honeymoon.\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer\n\nIn the photo below, we see an endearing moment while famous actress Audrey Hepburn helps her husband Mel Ferrer take his coat off. The actors had met in Paris in the early 50s and tied the knot in 1954, but decided to take a second honeymoon in 1957. Hepburn and Ferrer went back to their original honeymoon destination of Switzerland.\n\nAudrey Hepburn was one of the most celebrated actresses of her time, who starred in films such as “Sabrina,” “Roman Holiday,” and “Breakfast at Tiffany's,” while Mel was an established actor with appearances in films such as “The Caine Mutiny” and “War and Peace.”\n\nBobby Darin and Sandra Dee\n\nBobby Darin and Sandra Dee were an iconic couple in the 1950s. Bobby was a talented singer with hit tunes, such as “Dream Lover,” and Sandra was a popular actress starring in films like “A Summer Place” and “Gidget.” The two met on the set of “Come September,” and their chemistry was undeniable. They married soon after.\n\nThe sweet, young couple ended up tying the knot at an intimate ceremony in New Jersey at a mutual friend’s house. Above, you can see them cuddle together as they wait for their plane to take off for California to celebrate their honeymoon.\n\nGinger Rogers and Jacques Bergerac\n\nGinger Rogers was one of America’s favorite Hollywood leading ladies throughout the 1930s. Her performances alongside Fred Astaire and her role in hit films of the era made her an international sensation. Rogers married, for a fourth time, to French actor Jacques Bergerac in 1953. The two met at a party hosted by Hollywood royalty Barbara Hutton.\n\nBoth their wedding and their honeymoon were in sunny Palm Springs, where the photo above was taken. There might not be that many better locations to share both memories at. At the time, Ginger was 15 years older than Jacques, which obviously gave the press a lot to talk about.\n\nSusumu Hani and Sachiko Hidari\n\nFamous Japanese film director Susumu Hani and actress Sachiko Hidari met while working together on the set of his film “Early Spring” and just like that - the two fell madly in love. They got married in 1959 and finally went on their honeymoon a year later. They stayed together for 18 years.\n\nAbove, we see the happy young couple attending a film festival in London, where they spent their honeymoon. Susumu won awards for his films “Outlaw: Gangster VIP” and “Unholy Desire.” Sachiko was a celebrated actress known for her leading role in the film “Tokyo Twilight.” It was certainly a match made in Japan, that's for sure.\n\nPatrick MacNee and Katherine Woodville\n\nActors Patrick MacNee and Katherine Woodville had a honeymoon to remember in Palm Springs in 1966. Patrick was an actor from England, best known for his role as John Steed in the popular British television show “The Avengers.” Katherine starred in several British films and was also a former Bond girl.\n\nThey met while working on the set of “Dr. Jekyll & Sister Hyde” and fell hard for each other. Above, we see the happy newlyweds sharing a smile while enjoying some sun by the pool. Due to prior acting engagements, they had to delay their honeymoon for almost a year.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Michael Wilding\n\nIt seems like Elizabeth Taylor appears on this list way too many times. But it does make sense. After all, eight weddings probably means you also went on eight honeymoons. Looking as elegant as always, Elizabeth Taylor shares a laugh with her new husband, Michael Wilding, below.\n\nThe couple was leaving the Berkeley Hotel in London to head off to Paris, their next honeymoon destination. Wilding was a talented stage actor that fell madly in love with Taylor on their first meeting. Who can blame him? Their marriage lasted five years, during which they had two children. Considering Taylor’s track record with husbands, five years was quite an accomplishment.\n\nGeorge Harrison and Pattie Boyd\n\nIt seems like all of the Beatles ended up having special honeymoons in various parts of the world. And this included the man himself - George Harrison. After a small wedding ceremony in Surrey, England, the rock star from Liverpool and model Pattie Boyd flew off to Barbados for their honeymoon.\n\nThey met when she auditioned for a role in one of the Beatles' films and began dating shortly after. During their honeymoon in Barbados, they stayed at the luxurious Sandy Lane Hotel. The above photo was taken on a paradisiacal beach near the hotel, where they spent several weeks.\n\nLiza Minnelli and Peter Allen\n\nActress and singer Liza Minelli married Australian singer Peter Allen in 1967. Apart from being Judy Garland’s daughter, Liza rose to fame in her own right through her roles in “Cabaret” and “The Sterile Cuckoo.” She met Allen while performing together at a New York nightclub.\n\nAnd they fell madly in love, tieing the knot at an intimate ceremony in New York City. For their honeymoon, they went to the beautiful beaches of Florida, where the photo above was taken. A very young Liza cuddling with her new hubby on a lounge chair at the beach is the epitome of cozy.\n\nRonald and Nancy Reagan\n\nRonald Reagan, the American actor who went on to become the 40th President of the United States, married actress and singer Nancy in 1952. They met while co-starring in a movie called “Kings Row” and tied the knot just after his divorce from actress Jane Wyman had finalized.\n\nIn the photo above, we can see the smiling newlyweds holding hands while enjoying the sun in Phoenix, where they spent their honeymoon. The Reagans stayed at the beautiful Arizona Biltmore Hotel. But there is no denying that the best (at least for this couple), was yet to come, to say the very least.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller\n\nAfter her divorce from Joe DiMaggio, actress Marylin Monroe married American playwright Arthur Miller, in what is possibly the most iconic relationship of her lifetime - mainly due to the fact that it was completely unexpected. The couple honeymooned in England after their wedding in 1956 and stayed at a dreamy country estate in Sussex.\n\nAbove, we see the newlyweds at a New York airport, ready to board their plane. The press captured a passionate kiss, but apparently, Monroe was not her usual sassy self and denied photographers a capture at first. During the honeymoon, the high-profile couple enjoyed a break from all the press that awaited them at home.\n\nTony Curtis and Janet Leigh\n\nNow, this is one Hollywood couple that everyone will be familiar with, especially since their union gave us the talented Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis. American actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh were Hollywood royalty throughout the 50s and 60s. The stars met while shooting the film “Houdini,” which ultimately led to their marriage in 1951.\n\nAbove we see Curtis carrying his ecstatically happy new wife into their honeymoon suite at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Curtis had hit it big by landing roles in “Some Like It Hot” and “Spartacus,” and Leigh skyrocketed to fame with classics like “Psycho” and “Touch of Evil.”\n\nFrank Sinatra and Ava Gardner\n\nThe below photo shows an intimate moment between “Ol’ Blue Eyes” and Ava Gardner, holding hands while strolling through a beach in Miami during their honeymoon. Swoon-worthy crooner Frank Sinatra and alluring actress Ava finally tied the knot after four tumultuous years of on-and-off courtship. This was Sinatra’s second marriage.\n\nIn 1951 they headed south to Miami for a romantic honeymoon filled with luxury yacht rides and private beach parties. If we are going to be completely honest, this looks like it could be a romantic scene taken out of one of the Sean Connery-led James Bond movies. Sadly, their marriage only lasted six years.\n\nDiana Barrymore and Robert Wilcox\n\nIn 1950, actors Diana Barrymore and Robert Wilcox married at a church in New York City just one month before their honeymoon in Florida. The two stayed at the lavish Sherry-Frontenac Hotel in sunny Miami Beach for their honeymoon.\n\nBarrymore was an actress and prominent society figure, having starred on Broadway in the early 1940s. Wilcox was an actor and producer who had appeared on screen since the early 1930s. They even starred in a play while on their honeymoon! But what we need to point out from this photo is just how genuinely happy these two looked during their romantic getaway.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presley\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Elvis Presley knew how to handle his relationships in the most romantic way imaginable. When King of Rock 'n' Roll and Priscilla Beaulieu tied the knot in 1967, they jet-setted off to Palm Springs for their honeymoon. The singer of songs like \"Hound Dog\" and \"Suspicious Minds,\" along with his beautiful bride, had an unforgettable time.\n\nThey stayed at the iconic House of Tomorrow, a futuristic house and architectural marvel. Above, we see Elvis and Priscilla about to board a private jet, loaned by Frank Sinatra, towards their unforgettable honeymoon in California. They got married at the Aladdin Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nClark Gable and Sylvia Ashley\n\nIn 1950, Hollywood stars Clark Gable and Sylvia Ashley took a magical honeymoon to Hawaii. For Clark Gable, it was his fifth wedding, but the first time he married an actress. Sylvia was a talented actress who had worked opposite stars such as Cary Grant and Errol Flynn during her career.\n\nAbove we see the relaxed couple looking as tropical as can be while enjoying a beautiful beach in Hawaii. What better way to spend a honeymoon than on white sandy beaches with perfect weather year-round? Despite the incredible setting, Gable and Ashley would only last three years before eventually going their separate ways.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Conrad Nicholson \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr.\n\nBelow we see a young and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor celebrating her honeymoon with hotel heir Nicky Hilton on board the luxurious SS Queen Mary. They tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in 1950 and went on to have one of the most extravagant honeymoons of all time, taking a cruise around Europe.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actress had risen to fame with popular films like “National Velvet,” “Father of the Bride,” and “A Place in the Sun.” Conrad Nicholson Hilton Jr. was a wealthy hotelier who had inherited his fortune from his father's business empire. And the Hilton name still lives strong until this very day.\n\nRoger Moore and Luisa Mattioli\n\nRoger Moore and Luisa Mattioli were very famous actors of the 1960s, making them the ultimate celebrity couple after tying the knot in 1969. The English actor and his gorgeous Italian wife celebrated their honeymoon around France during the summer of 1969.\n\nThey were both established actors, with Roger having played the leading role in the “James Bond” movies, and Mattioli starring in films like \"No Man's Land\" and \"The Lovely Lola.\" She must've felt like a real Bond girl during that honeymoon. Together, the glamorous couple toured France in style, as can be seen above, showing them enjoying a day in the sun at the beach in Cannes.\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono\n\nLeave it to rockstar couple John Lennon and Yoko Ono to have a very unconventional honeymoon. After getting married in 1969, the Beatles and the avant-garde artist staged a weeklong 'Bed-In for Peace' — a publicity stunt intended to promote worldwide understanding, love, and peace.\n\nWith reporters present and cameras rolling, they turned the event into a media circus that made headlines around the world. We imagine it mustn’t be so hard for a newlywed couple to stay in bed for seven days while in the Presidential Suite of the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam. This might be the most iconic celebrity honeymoon of all time.\n\nTyrone Power and Linda Christian\n\nAfter tying the knot in the beautiful church of Santa Francesca Romana in Rome, Hollywood actors Linda Christian and Tyrone Power celebrated their honeymoon in Cervinia. In case you didn't know - this is the northwestern part of Italy and is a very popular winter location for tourists. Below we see the glamorous couple posing in front of a majestic snowcapped mountain.\n\nThe handsome actor and his gorgeous Mexican movie-star bride had met whilst filming the Technicolor epic “Captain from Castile” in 1947 and fell for each other almost instantly. They stayed together up until 1956 and had two children.\n\nRocio Durcal and Antonio \"Junior\" Morales Barretto\n\nRocio Durcal and Antonio \"Junior\" Morales Barretto had the trip of a lifetime when they decided to honeymoon in Paris in 1970. Rocio was only 21 but already a well-known singer in both Latin America and Spain. Antonio, her husband, was known as a songwriter, producer, and guitarist who wrote some of Rocio's most beloved songs.\n\nTogether they were two of the most successful musical couples of their era, so why not celebrate with a fairytale wedding in Paris? Above, we see the young lovebirds taking in the sights with a beautiful backdrop of the Arc du Triomphe. If that doesn't set the tone for your marriage, we don't know what will.\n\nLana Turner and Henry J. \"Bob\" Topping\n\nIn 1948, Lana Turner and Henry J. “Bob” Topping tied the knot — and what better way to kick off their blissful union than with a dream honeymoon? The newlyweds flew off on an exotic trip around the world, with stops in London, Madrid, Rome, and Paris. Below we can see the gleaming couple arriving in London.\n\nTurner was already a bonafide Hollywood star before her marriage to Topping, having appeared in films such as “Ziegfeld Girl” and “The Postman Always Rings Twice.” Meanwhile, Topping had made his fortune as president of the American League's New York Yankees from 1945 until 1947.\n\nLiza Minnelli and Jack Haley Jr.\n\nOne of Hollywood’s most glamorous newlyweds, actress Liza Minelli and Jack Haley Jr. got married all the way back in 1974. After a few weeks, they embarked on a romantic honeymoon to London, where the loving photo below was taken. Just look at them. They look so snug and comfortable all cuddled up on that huge sofa.\n\nAs it turns out, Liza’s mother, Judy Garland, and Jack’s father, Jack Haley, appeared in 1939’s “The Wizard of Oz” together. She played Dorothy, and he played the Tin Man. Now talk about keeping it in the family. Liza and Jack stayed together until 1979.\n\nMick and Bianca Jagger\n\nWe would expect nothing less from the legendary Rolling Stones rockstar than to have an epic honeymoon. Mick Jagger married Nicaraguan activist and model Bianca in 1971, and while they may have had a tumultuous relationship, that didn't stop the happy couple from jetting off to Venice for an unforgettable honeymoon.\n\nThe English singer and the former fashion model and activist wed after just one year of dating, with Mick famously saying: \"I think it's time I got married. I'm getting old!\" They might not have been your classic fairytale couple, but they certainly looked like they were having fun while enjoying the gondolas in Venice.\n\nRobert Wagner and Natalie Wood\n\nRobert Wagner and Natalie Wood first met in the 1950s and got married in 1957. They separated three years later but got back together in 1969 and decided to celebrate their second honeymoon in St. Thomas, where they stayed at the luxurious Virgin Island Hotel and Spa.\n\nThe two were crazy about each other, as shown in the photo when the couple was above the SS France returning to New York. When interviewed by reporters, Wagner said that it had been \"the most wonderful week of my life.\" After their return from St. Thomas, Robert and Natalie went on to live happily ever after until her death in 1981.\n\nSammy Davis Jr. and Altovise Gore\n\nIn 1972, internationally renowned entertainer and icon of the Civil Rights Movement Sammy Davis Jr. and actress Altovise Gore married in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sammy is remembered for being a \"triple threat\" — he could sing, dance, and act, making him one of the most popular performers of all time. Not to mention the fact that he was Frank Sinatra's sidekick in the Rat Pack.\n\nMeanwhile, Altovise Gore was best known for her roles on Broadway and in numerous films throughout the 1960s and 70s. Never have two people looked happier than Sammy and Altovise in the photo above, enjoying their honeymoon while arriving in Southampton on the QEII ocean liner.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and John Warner\n\nElizabeth Taylor and John Warner were two of the biggest names in Hollywood when they tied the knot all the way back in 1976. Their honeymoon was anything but typical — instead of jet-setting to a romantic beach destination, the couple chose to visit exotic Israel.\n\nElizabeth and John's trip to Tel Aviv was her very first visit to the Holy Land. It was a truly unique experience for both newlyweds as they explored the historic sites, visited local markets, and even attended a reception hosted by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Now that’s an extraordinary way to start off married life!\n\nPrince Charles and Princess Diana\n\nPrince Charles and Princess Diana met in 1977 and got married four years later in 1981. Following their wedding, they went on a honeymoon to Balmoral Castle in Scotland. This castle was owned by the Royal family at the time, so it was especially meaningful for them to spend such an important time of their lives there as newlyweds.\n\nAbove, we see the young royals sharing a tender moment together by the river Dee. As always, the Princess of Wales was dressed to the nines in an elegant suit. Of course, things didn't end well at all for this world-famous couple. In fact, it ended in the deepest of tragedies.\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Sr. and Martha Firestone Ford\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Sr. and Martha Firestone Ford were married in 1947, shortly after William graduated from Yale University. William was Henry Ford’s grandson, and Martha was the daughter of the Firestone Tire & Company founder, so this wedding marked the union of two powerful families of American industry and innovation.\n\nAbove, we see the young couple enjoying the waves at a beautiful Cambridge beach in Bermuda. Imagine dipping your newlywed toes in those soft, gentle, flowing Caribbean waters. It's the stuff that dreams are made of. After the romantic vacation, the couple returned home to begin their lives together at Fair Lane Manor, which was built by William’s father.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n\nBefore becoming the longest reigning Queen of England, we see a young Princess Elizabeth posing for a photo with her new husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The happy young couple had a luxurious honeymoon at the Broadlands estate in Hampshire in 1947. We know this photo is black and white, but we can clearly see where the green is supposed to be.\n\nThe couple also visited many local attractions, like the newly opened Balmoral Castle and Osborne House (the former of which the Queen would frequently visit throughout her life). The Broadlands estate will forever be remembered as the place that marked the start of their long-lasting marriage.\n\nBette Davis and William Sherry\n\nFamous actress Bette Davis and her husband William Sherry had a honeymoon for the ages, to say the very least. First off, they jetted off to Mexico, where they visited Acapulco, Taxco, and some of the country’s most exciting places. That in itself would have been a great trip - even for singles, nevermind one's honeymoon!\n\nAfter enjoying the beach, the colorful markets, and the delicious food, they went to the beautiful White Mountains of New Hampshire, where they spent the rest of their honeymoon. The couple stayed at Davis’s Sugar Hill home near the mountains. Granite State? More like \"Diamond Ring State,\" if you ask us.\n\nMary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks\n\nMary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were two of the most famous stars in Hollywood when they got married all the way back in 1920. Wow. We can't believe that was more than a century ago! Oh, how time flies, especially in the world of Hollywood. To celebrate, the couple went on a romantic honeymoon and took a luxurious ocean liner across the Atlantic Ocean toward England.\n\nAbove we can see the happy newlyweds laughing on board the ship, ready to embark on their journey across the pond. While in England, they visited Buckingham Palace and had dinner with King George V. Now that’s an unforgettable way to start a life together!\n\nLord and Lady Louis Mountbatten\n\nPrince Louis Mountbatten, cousin of the King of England, and his wife, Edwina Ashley, set off on a lavish honeymoon in 1922. They went on a grand trip across India, stopping in Simla, Delhi, and Lucknow. During their trip, the couple went wild boar hunting, visited the Taj Mahal, and even visited the Maharajah of Jaipur.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, their trip ended on an especially extravagant note — they were gifted 250 acres of land which became known as 'Mountbatten's Garden.' No wonder they both look so happy in this photo as they arrive for the last part of the trip in New York.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of York\n\nFeast your eyes on the beautiful image of The Duke and Duchess of York taking a romantic stroll through the woods during their honeymoon in 1923. During that wonderful getaway, they spent time in both Polesden Lacey and Scotland. Prince Albert, later known as King George VI, married Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who would later be known around the world as The Queen Mother.\n\nFun fact - George was actually turned down by Elizabeth when he first proposed to her in 1921. But the young lady eventually agreed to marry him a couple of years later. They tied the knot in Westminster Abbey when the bride laid her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.\n\nCary Grant and Virginia Cherrill\n\nHollywood actors Cary Grant and Virginia Cherrill got married at the Registry Office in England in 1934 and were quite the honeymooners. On their post-wedding getaway, they went on a month-long romantic trip that ended in Acapulco. Always the gentleman, Cary went out of his way to make Virginia feel like a princess at every turn.\n\nThe lovebirds were caught on camera staring lovingly at each other as they arrived in New York — the starting point for their honeymoon, which ended in Mexico. Despite the initial romance, Grant and Cherrill only lasted a year. She would be the first of five women that Grant would end up marrying.\n\nRonald Reagan and Jane Wyman\n\nAcademy-award-winning actress Jane Wyman married Ronald Reagan (back in the days when he was an actor and long before he even considered running for President) all the way back in 1940. What better way was there to start their new life together than with a honeymoon in sunny Palm Springs, California?\n\nThe couple indulged in the city's finest dining, lounged by the pool, and even played some ping pong, as seen above. They stayed at the luxurious El Mirador Hotel — the epitome of Hollywood glamour. They also took a hot air balloon ride above the desert. We think that makes up a pretty splendid honeymoon.\n\nMarylin Monroe and Joe DiMaggio\n\nRavishing actress Marilyn Monroe and heartthrob baseball player Joe DiMaggio jetted off to Japan for their honeymoon in 1954, and understandably, they were the talk of the town. The glamorous couple was welcomed with open arms and showered with gifts, and they took full advantage of their time in the land of the rising sun.\n\nThey visited Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hiroshima. Above, we can see the young couple visiting some beached sailboats on the coast. Unfortunately, not even an exotic trip to Japan was enough to keep these two together, as they divorced only a year later. Imagine that! A year!\n\nJoan Crawford and Alfred Steele\n\nFamous actress Joan Crawford married business mogul Alfred Steele in May of 1955, and the happy couple flew all the way to Europe on the S.S. United States. We see them below in an endearing photo showing Crawford cleaning some wedding cake frosting off her new hubby's cheek. Now ain't that something!\n\nThe couple traveled through Europe for six magical weeks until returning home to the U.S. They stayed together for four years until Steele’s death in 1959. And after tying the knot on four separate occasions, it would finally be the end of Crawford's time experimenting with holy matrimony.\n\nRock Hudson and Phyllis Gates\n\nIsn't this just the life? Relaxing by the pool, drinking milk out of a coconut during your honeymoon. It really doesn't get much better than that. Hollywood star Rock Hudson had the pleasure of doing exactly this with his wife Phyllis Gates during their romantic getaway at the Half Moon Hotel in Montego Bay, Jamaica.\n\nGates was actually Hudson's secretary. And many speculated that the actor married Gates to cover up the rumors surrounding his own orientation. Despite this, the couple's marriage only lasted three years and Gates would receive alimony, never to remarry again. As for Hudson, the rumors just kept on coming.\n\nOrson Welles and Paula Mori\n\nWhen you think of great actors, Orson Welles is inevitably going to be one of the first names a lot of people think of. This legendary performer had both a prolific professional and personal life. The \"Citizen Kane\" star tied the knot with his third wife, the Countess of Girfalco, Paola Mori, back in 1955.\n\nThis photo shows the newlyweds during their honeymoon on a boat off the coast of Naples. Mori had previously starred in the film of the same year, \"Mr. Arkadin.\" After starting an affair together, Mori's parents insisted that she married Welles immediately. Thankfully for their sake, the couple stayed together until Welles's passing 30 years later.\n\nJanet Leigh and Bob Brandt\n\nThere is no denying that the marriage that most people remember Janet Leigh for was the one she had with Tony Curtis. After all, the couple did bring Jamie Lee Curtis into the world, who became an iconic actress in her own right. But this photo shows the \"Psycho\" star with her fourth husband, stockbroker Bob Brandt.\n\nThey were in New York, still enjoying their honeymoon at the time. However, she was also promoting her new film \"The Manchurian Candidate.\" It turns out that Brandt would also be Leigh's last husband, as they would remain happily married for the next 42 years, up until her passing in 2004.\n\nArthur Miller and Inge Morath\n\nWhile many will know Arthur Miller mostly for his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, there were other women who were able to call themselves his wife. This photo taken in 1962 shows the legendary writer with his third wife, Inge Morath at Geneva Airport, Switzerland, while on their honeymoon.\n\nMorath had been working as a photographer during the production of \"The Misfits,\" when she first met Miller. The couple ended up having two children and they remained together until Morath's passing in 2002. For the remaining three years of his life, Miller was in a relationship with a woman by the name of Agnes Barley.\n\nBrigitte Bardot and Gunther Sachs\n\nIt's not every day that you get to fly away to Papeete, Tahiti, for your honeymoon. And yet, that's exactly what Brigitte Bardot did with her newlywed husband Gunther Sachs after tying the knot. They can be seen here at Los Angeles International Airport just before embarking on their romantic adventure.\n\nIn fact, it was just the beginning of an epic tour around the world, one which culminated in Paris. Despite arguably one of the most incredible honeymoons of all time, the couple decided to part ways after three years together. In total, Bardot got married three times in her lifetime.\n\nJane Fonda and Roger Vadim\n\nIn September 1965, paparazzi flocked to the streets of Rome to capture photos of Jane Fonda and Roger Vadim trying to enjoy their honeymoon together. The iconic actress met her first husband, the French film director Vadim, during the early '60s and it didn't take long before they declared themselves an item.\n\nThey tied the knot at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas just a month before their romantic getaway in Rome. Despite having a daughter together, the couple ultimately separated during the early '70s, amid rumors of Fonda's infidelity. Just days after the divorce was finalized in 1973, Fonda married activist Tom Hayden.\n\nPrincess Caroline and Philippe Junot\n\nSure, these two looked happy enough during their honeymoon - but royalty and riches will make that possible in most situations. Princess Caroline and Monaco tied the knot with Philippe Junot back in 1978. And they had an absolutely majestic time in Papeete, Tahiti.\n\nBut here's the thing - the wedding itself was spectacular. They got married in Monaco, in a luxurious ceremony that had 650 guests in attendance, including the likes of Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, and Ava Gardner, to name a few. Despite all this, the couple still got divorced in 1980, eventually being annulled by the Catholic Church in 1992.\n\nYul Brynner and Kathy Lee\n\nThere are plenty of celebrity relationships with huge age gaps, and Yul Brynner and Kathy Lee was right up there. Less than two weeks after the annulment of his last marriage, the famous actor married his fourth wife in 1983. He was 62 years of age and the ballerina (from Ipoh, Malaysia) was only 25.\n\nIt turns out that it was love at first sight for Yul, who met Kathy on the set of \"The King and I.\" Here, they can be seen arriving at Heathrow Airport after a flight from Los Angeles. Kathy would prove to be Brynner's final wife, as he passed away two years after they recited their nuptials.\n\nPamela Anderson and Tommy Lee\n\nBoy, where do we start with Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee? Arguably one of the most controversial celebrity marriages of all time, these two were certainly the talk of the town back in the '90s. \"Baywatch\" star Anderson made the Mötley Crüe drummer her first husband in 1995, after knowing him for less than a week!\n\nNot even Pam's mother knew about their matrimony. She found out in a magazine. The couple was seen enjoying the white beaches of Cancun, Mexico following their wedding. But the marriage was a rollercoaster ride of emotions and debauchery. And a messy divorce in 1998 and a long custody battle over their children would follow.\n\nAnita Ekberg and Rik Van Nutter\n\nThere are a few celebrities on this list that took to the streets of Rome to enjoy their honeymoon. One example was \"The Iceberg\" Anita Ekberg, who flew to the Italian capital with her new husband, actor Rik Van Nutter. In fact, Ekberg tied the knot with two actors during her lifetime.\n\nBefore her time with Rik, she married Anthony Steel, who she was with for about three years. Her time with Van Nutter certainly lasted longer, but they too called it quits after being together for more than a decade. But Ekberg's most serious relationship was with Fiat owner Gianni Agnelli, despite never actually marrying.\n\nJean Simmons and Richard Brooks\n\nNot to be confused with KISS frontman Gene Simmons, the talented actress Jean Simmons was a force to be reckoned with in her own right. This photo sees her enjoying her honeymoon in Paris with the Hollywood writer/director Richard Brooks.\n\nYou can even see the Arc du Triomph in the background as they take a stroll down the Champs-Elysees, hand in hand together. Things were looking good for the two, especially after having a daughter the following year. However, they ultimately decided to call time on their marriage in 1980. Simmons was also married to Steward Grainger prior to her time with Brooks.\n\nNatalie Wood and Richard Gregson\n\nHere we can see Natalie Wood and film producer Richard Gregson spending some quality time together in the beautiful area of Kitzbuhel, Austria. The couple had gotten married the year before, in 1969, after dating for about three years. And they had finally found an opportunity to have their honeymoon.\n\nHowever, they were also there to attend the European premiere of Gregson's film ''Der Abfahtssieger.\" Despite having a daughter and looking like quite the poster couple, Wood and Gregson ultimately went their separate ways just a couple of years after tying the knot. The divorce was finalized a year later.\n\nDavid Bailey and Marie Helvin\n\nDavid Bailey is best known for his photography that covered the Swinging Sixties. He even took some harrowing snaps of the infamous Kray twins. But this iconic photographer also wanted to capture some personal moments too in his life - most notably with his wife at the time, Marie Helvin.\n\nAfter getting married, Bailey and Helvin left to Heathrow airport to fly to Tokyo for their working honeymoon. They ended up being married for 10 years, ultimately parting ways in 1985. A year later though, Bailey married his fourth wife, Catherine Dyer, and the couple are still going strong today.\n\nPele and Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi\n\nThe late soccer player Pele didn't only score tons of goals in his illustrious career. The Brazil legend also scored a lot in the love department. In 1966, around the time he was competing in the World Cup of that year, the Santos man shacked up with Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi.\n\nJust before the tournament started, the couple took a detour to Paris, France, for a pretty romantic honeymoon. Despite having two daughters and a son, Pele and Rosemeri decided to separate in 1982. Edson Arantes do Nascimento (his full name) was married to Marcia Aoki up until his untimely passing in 2022.\n\nSylvia Plath and Ted Hughes\n\nIn 1956, iconic poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes embarked on their romantic honeymoon in Benidorm, Spain, before spending time in Paris, France. They married that year and later returned to England, with Plath teaching at Smith College and meeting influential poets such as Lowell and Sexton.\n\nTruth be told though, their marriage encountered challenges, infidelity notwithstanding. Plath also experienced a surge of both creative energy and relentless depression. She managed to complete her poetry collection and publish her novel, despite facing critical indifference. Tragically, Plath's life was cut short in 1963, leaving behind a complex legacy as one of America's revered poets.\n\nAnton Chekhov and Olga Knipper\n\nSo you might have already heard of \"Chekhov's Gun,\" but have you ever heard of \"Chekhov's Honeymoon?\" Yes, even the famous Russian writer enjoyed a romantic getaway after tying the knot with his wife Olga Leonardovna Knipper-Chekhova. Truth be told though, Chekhov opposed the idea of marriage as a whole but was ultimately persuaded to change his tune.\n\nUltimately, Chekhov and Olga maintained a long-distance relationship due to their professional arrangements. And although this would put a strain on many couples, this pair seemed to go against the odds and stayed married until Chekhov's passing three years after they married."
