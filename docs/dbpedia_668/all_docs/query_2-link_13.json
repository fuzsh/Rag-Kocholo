        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Jean-Pierre Salomons on January 5, 1911, in Paris, handsome French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont began his film career at the age of 20, during the depths of the Great Depression. Acting in both film and theater, he quickly made a name for himself in Europe and became a popular matinee idol. He was briefly married to French actress Blanche Montel, who was about a decade his senior, in the late 1930s. Aumont, who was born Jewish, saw his acting career vanish when his native land fell to German forces in 1940. Fearing for his life, he left France in 1942 and relocated to the US. Quickly finding acting work, he made his Hollywood debut the MGM war drama Assignment in Brittany (1943; with Susan Peters). At about the time of his Hollywood arrival, Aumont met gorgeous actress Maria Montez, and the couple married in July 1943. Shortly afterward, Aumont joined the Free French Forces to help liberate France. Following the war, he resumed his acting career and began a family with Montez; the couple welcomed a daughter, actress Tina Aumont, in 1946. Aumont's film career took off in the days after World War II in such films as Heartbeat (1946; with Ginger Rogers and Adolphe Menjou), Song of Scheherazade (1947; with Yvonne De Carlo and Brian Donlevy), and Wicked City (1949; with Maria Montez and Lilli Palmer).\n\nLEFT: With second wife Maria Montez at the time of their marriage in 1943.

As a single father, Aumont raised his daughter and worked on stage, in television, and in films in both France and the U.S. throughout the early 1950s. After a whirlwind relationship with Grace Kelly, Aumont married Italian actress Marisa Pavan, twin sister of actress Pier Angeli, on March 27, 1956. Pavan is best known as one of the stars of the romance The Rose Tattoo (1955; with Burt Lancaster and Anna Magnani).\n\nthe films of jean-pierre aumont\n\nMaman Colibri (1937)\n\nFrom the French release Maman Colibri\n\nAssignment in Brittany (1943)\n\nWith Susan Peters in Aumont's first American film, the MGM war drama Assignment in Brittany\n\nHeartbeat (1946)\n\nFrom the RKO romance Heartbeat with Ginger Rogers\n\nSong of Scheherazade (1947)\n\nLEFT: With Yvonne De Carlo in the Universal-International adventure Song of Scheherazade.
