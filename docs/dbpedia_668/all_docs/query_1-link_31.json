        "text": "Born. To Marisa Pavan, 25, actress of screen (The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit) and TV (Antigone, Dominique), twin sister of Italian-born Cinemactress Pier Angeli, and Jean Pierre Aumont, 47, French cinemactor (The Seventh Sin): a son, their first child, his second; in Santa Monica. Name: Jean Claude. Weight: 7 Ibs. 13½ oz.\n\nBorn. To Ralph Kiner, 34, onetime Pittsburgh Pirates’ home-run king (lifetime total: 367), who retired in 1955, and Nancy Chaffee Kiner, 28, onetime tennis star: their first daughter, third child; in San Diego. Name: Katherine Chaffee. Weight: 7 Ibs. 5½ oz.\n\nDied. Antony Beauchamp, 39, society photographer, son-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill, husband of Sarah Churchill since 1949; by his own hand (an overdose of sleeping pills); in London.\n\nDied. Clara Bell Walsh, 70-odd (“none of your business”), widow of St. Louis, Millionaire Julius S. Walsh Jr. (died 1922), lavish Manhattan hostess who had a suite in the Plaza Hotel for nearly 50 years, and whose intimate soirees of “200 or so” friends were the starting point of many a Broadway career; of a cerebral hemorrhage; in Manhattan.\n\nDied. William Allen Jowitt, 72, first (1952) Earl Jowitt; in Bury St. Edmunds, England. Famed British barrister and sometime (1922-24) Liberal Member of Parliament, Jowitt was Attorney General in the second Labor government (1929-31) of Ramsay MacDonald, Solicitor General (1940-42) in Winston Churchill’s wartime coalition, Lord Chancellor (1945-51) in the Cabinet of Labor’s Clement Attlee, writer of whip-witted prose on legal subjects. Most notable of his works: The Strange Case of Alger Hiss, in which he concluded that Defendant Hiss (see PEOPLE) was unjustly convicted of perjury, the case a monument to feckless U.S. justice and the jury system.\n\nDied. Irving Langmuir, 76, first U.S. industrial chemist to win (1932) the Nobel Prize, prolific experimenter in what he called the “borderland of chemistry and physics,” a “pure research” staffer at General Electric Co.’s research lab for 41 years, and a pioneer rainmaker; of a coronary thrombosis; in Falmouth, Mass. Langmuir once said: “Whatever work I’ve done, I’ve done for the fun of it.” His fun included such breakthrough inventions as the gas-filled light bulb and the high-vacuum power tube (the heart of modern radio and TV broadcasting).\n\nDied. Edgar Odell Lovett, 86, longtime (1908-46) president of Houston’s Rice Institute, who was teaching math and astronomy at Princeton when its president, Woodrow Wilson, nominated him for the Texas post; in Houston."
