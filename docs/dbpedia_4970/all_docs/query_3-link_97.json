        "text": "\"Ascenseur pour l'échafaud\" is a 1958 French film directed by Louis Malle. It was released as \"Elevator to the Gallows\" in the USA and as \"Lift to the Scaffold\" in the UK. Film noir.\n\nMiles Davis performs the score....I haven't seen this, but a friend of mine just did and wrote me about it. I don't know if he composed it or just played it or anything, really. Was it ever released back in the day or reissued on cd? It is supposedly quite haunting.\n\nWhat is it called--under which name? Who wrote the music?\n\nThe current CD is very short - the length of the original 10\" LP. There was an expanded CD that used additional music, especially the film content minus the added reverb. I would try to find the expanded version.\n\n...what they've re-released or remastered the original PolyGram cd that had like 26 tracks and put one out with only the original 10 tracks?\n\nThe extra tracks are actually quite amazing, various takes that must be heard. Should be easy to find the long version, must have been in print for a decade or more.\n\nYes. The Verve CD from I think 2007 - the affordable CD on that lengthy list - has 10 tracks. Amazon lists all 26 tracks and the reviews correct Amazon. Be sure whichever one you get has the full track content.\n\nI only have the 10 track cd from a used bin, but upon hearing it, put the expanded set on my wish-list.\n\nThe version listed for $8.49 on that page contains all 26 tracks. This version with all of the alternate takes is the best to have.\n\nI got mine many years ago. It's a West German pressed Fontana label issue (836 305-2).\n\nCheers,\n\nChris\n\nThat is probably my favorite Miles Davis recording of all. It really stands alone in his body of work.\n\nThat material was originally issued in the US on a Columbia LP called \"Jazz Track,\" with the Miles Davis stuff on one side and Art Blakey's soundtrack to another French film on the other.\n\nI'm shocked that Polygram discontinued the expanded version of this CD! WTF?????? The 26-track CD is essential.\n\na speakers corner double album for $35 bucks? I think the 26 tracks are too long to fit on one platter, this would have to be two I'm thinking. Does anyone have this one and can you confirm the track listing?\n\nyeah I see that now, I would have thought it was too long to fit on one platter.\n\nSide two of this had three cuts from Miles' May 1958 session that included Fran-Dance, Stella by Starlight, and On Green Dolphin St.\n\nThe score was recorded in Paris, France, on December 4-5, 1957, with three French musicians and expatriate Kenny Clarke:\n\nMiles Davis - trumpet\n\nBarney Wilen - tenor saxophone\n\nRené Urtreger - piano\n\nPierre Michelot - bass\n\nKenny Clarke - drums\n\nGil Evans was not involved.\n\nThis is still my go to version but there have been quite a few digipack re-issues more recently."
