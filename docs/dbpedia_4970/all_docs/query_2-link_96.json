        "text": "As a big film music fan, I love all four scores that have been made for the Jurassic Films. Williams obviously being the most iconic. I was also lucky to go see my favourite composer Michael Giacchino in London a few days ago and he played the Jurassic World suite, which is amazing in my opinion. It got me thinking, who else would produce a great Jurassic Park score?\n\nJurassic Park (John Willliams) - Great score, iconic, lots of variety.\n\nThe Lost World (John Williams) - Another great score, much different from the first and nice callbacks.\n\nJurassic Park 3 (Don Davis) - My least favourite, but still great. Some of the themes such as Tree People are really nice and I like the callback to Journey to the Island with \"A Walk in the Park\". I also think Don Davis nailed the John Williams sound.\n\nJurassic World (Michael Giacchino) - Probably one of my favourite recent scores. It sounds nostalgic without repeating old themes and has some great memorable themes that recur throughout the movie.\n\nIf Michael Giacchino was for some reason too busy to score Jurassic world 3, who would you pick to carry it on? Who do you think would nail the Jurassic sound?\n\nPersonally, one of my picks would be Bear McCreary. He makes some really good thrilling soundtracks such as 10 Cloverfield Lane and a lot of it reminds me of Williams music if it was modernized.\n\nAnother composer who I think would make a pretty good memorable score for Jurassic Park would be Roque Banos (Evil Dead), that score had everything, from emotion, memorable themes, exciting action cues, it's great!\n\nSix-Foot Turkey wrote:\n\nTroyal1 wrote:\n\nQuote :\n\nIf Michael Giacchino was for some reason too busy to score Jurassic world 3, who would you pick to carry it on?\n\nJohn Williams!!!\n\nI think he's tied up with Star Wars at the moment haha\n\nI know haha, but you did ask who you’d pick\n\nI’ll sleep on it and give a more reasonable answer.\n\nI’ll throw one out right now. I’m not sure he’d be good for JW but I think Alexandre Desplat could be a solid contender.\n\nThe only things off the top of my head I know he did was Godzilla and deathly hallows(both parts). But I know he’s done much more.\n\nI know this is impossible because he’s dead. But I’d love to hear a James Horner score for a Jurassic film. He did an incredible job in ‘The Land before time’. I think he captured some beautiful emotions of wonder and sadness in that score.\n\nTroyal1 wrote:\n\nSix-Foot Turkey wrote:\n\nTroyal1 wrote:\n\nQuote :\n\nIf Michael Giacchino was for some reason too busy to score Jurassic world 3, who would you pick to carry it on?\n\nJohn Williams!!!\n\nI think he's tied up with Star Wars at the moment haha\n\nI know haha, but you did ask who you’d pick\n\nI’ll sleep on it and give a more reasonable answer.\n\nI’ll throw one out right now.

Such a shame he died.\n\nSix-Foot Turkey wrote:\n\nTroyal1 wrote:\n\nSix-Foot Turkey wrote:\n\nTroyal1 wrote:\n\nQuote :\n\nIf Michael Giacchino was for some reason too busy to score Jurassic world 3, who would you pick to carry it on?\n\nJohn Williams!!!\n\nI think he's tied up with Star Wars at the moment haha\n\nI know haha, but you did ask who you’d pick\n\nI’ll sleep on it and give a more reasonable answer.\n\nI’ll throw one out right now.
