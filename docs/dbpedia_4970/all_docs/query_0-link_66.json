        "text": "I saw The Matrix trilogy again recently and thought the score was really fantastic! I have earlier thought the same about this particular score and how underated it is. I thought it really got into the skin of the film and provided an excellent score......\n\nIts hardly ever talked about.....for some reason....Don Davis is using some great orchestration/writing (Nobody else has been credited with orchestration on IMDB) and avant garde techniques there....\n\nThe blend of electronic music with the orchestra is also really great....great mix on the final matrix soundtrack too....\n\nTanuj.\n\nTry listening to John Adams's 'Doctor Atomic Symphony'. When I first heard it, I thought someone had arranged the score to 'The Matrix' in the style of Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nAlso, there is a version of 'The Matrix' on DVD (the US two-disk boxed set with the first sequel, I think) that has an isolated music track, where Don Davis talks about the music in the gaps in the score.\n\nI loved the score too. It also reminded me of John Adams - Harmonielehre in particular.\n\nBest,\n\nM\n\nP.S. - Also for those that didn't already know, Varese Sarabande released a deluxe edition of the score within the last year or so that's well worth getting.\n\nI also love this score very much. And besides John Adams, I hear Witold Lutoslawski and aleatoric counterpoint, especially in the cue \"Unable To Speak\" in the first film.\n\nDon Davis is an incredibly underestimated film composer. He was chosen by John Williams himself to score Jurassic Park III - also one of my favorite scores. He has had to score some pretty awful movies as well, for some odd reason. And after Matrix he has been concentrating on writing an opera. He deserves to get some really good movies to score and fast."
