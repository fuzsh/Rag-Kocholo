        "text": "Few blockbusters can claim to be as influential as The Matrix (1999), written and directed by the Wachowskis. From its super high-concept that has wormed its way into the public’s imagination (what if we’re all just living in a computer simulation?), to Keanu Reeves’ iconic hero Neo, to the brilliant, jaw-dropping and story-based visual effects, The Matrix delivered on all fronts. Its three films grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide, and a fourth is on the way.\n\nThe Matrix demanded a score that was as unique, sophisticated and imaginative as its concept and action—and got one from composer Don Davis. Davis, who scored the Wachowskis’ Bound (1996), reinvented the symphonic language of the action blockbuster by drawing on cutting-edge concert-hall minimalism and his own background as an avant-garde composer, while maintaining the energy, pace and density required of a studio action film.\n\nFrom the clashing-brass “reflections,” to the racing strings, pounding percussion and flittering, repeating musical “cells,” the Matrix score fits hand-in-glove with the film’s concept of a computer-controlled reality—and offers a unique musical thumbprint that is recognizable sometimes only from a single note or chord. It is the rare commercial triumph that is also an artistic landmark.\n\nThe Matrix was released by Varèse Sarabande at the time of the film, and then in a Deluxe Edition that fit as much of the score as possible on one CD. By popular demand, this 3-LP set presents the complete score.\n\nTracklist\n\nSide A:\n\nLogos / The Matrix Main Title\n\nTrinity Infinity\n\nNeo Con Brio\n\nFollow The White Rabbit\n\nNeo On The Edge\n\nThrough The Surveillance Monitor\n\nUnable To Speak\n\nBait And Switch\n\nSide B:\n\nSwitched For Life\n\nSwitched At Birth\n\nSwitches Brew\n\nCold Hearted Switch\n\nNascent Nauseous Neo\n\nA Morpheus Moment\n\nBow Whisk Orchestra\n\nSide C:\n\nDomo Showdown\n\nSwitch Or Break Show\n\nShake, Borrow, Switch\n\nSwitch Works Her Boa\n\nBring Me Dinner\n\nThe System\n\nFreeze Face\n\nSwitch Woks Her Boar\n\nCypher Cybernetic\n\nIgnorance Is Bliss / Cyber Cyphernetic\n\nSee Who?\n\nSwitch Out\n\nSide D:\n\nBoon Spoy\n\nOracle Cookies\n\nThreat Mix\n\nExit Mr. Hat\n\nOn Your Knees, Switch\n\nSide E:\n\nMix The Art\n\nWhoa, Switch Broke\n\nThe Cure\n\nIt’s The Smell\n\nThe Lobby\n\nNo More Spoons\n\nDodge This\n\nFast Learning\n\nOntological Shock\n\nSide F:\n\nThat’s Gonna Hurt\n\nSurprise\n\nHe’s The One Alright"
