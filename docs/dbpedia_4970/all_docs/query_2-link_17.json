        "text": "IGN FilmForce interviewer Kenneth Plume recently talked to composer/orchestrator Don Davis.\n\nIn his 20-year career as a composer and orchestrator, Davis has composed fifty movies, TV series, and made-for-TV movies, and orchestrated over thirty other movies. His composer credits include House on Haunted Hill, The Matrix, Bound, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Hart to Hart. Movies he's worked on as an orchestrator include A Bug's Life, Titanic, The Phantom, Toy Story, and Die Hard 2.\n\nIn his five part conversation with Ken, Davis discusses his start in the business, the difference between a composer and an orchestrator, the difficulties involved in scoring for television, the differences between scoring for film and television, scoring for animation, working with Randy Newman, James Horner, Alan Silvestri and Michael Kamen, and his work on The Matrix and its two upcoming sequels.\n\nPLUME: Tell me a little bit about your background¿\n\nDAVIS: I started out playing trumpet when I was 9 years old and played in school bands and stuff. I started playing piano and guitar when I was about 12, and I started writing then too, but it was just kid stuff ¿ you know, rock and pop songs, and that kind of thing. It was when I was in high school that I started writing a little more seriously. I started writing for jazz bands mostly, because I was playing in various jazz ensembles. I went to UCLA thinking of getting into film music, because I noticed ¿ even though there was something of a \"big band\" revival at the time ¿ that this big band arranging thing wasn't going to take me very far.\n\nWhile I was at UCLA, I really fell in with the new music crowd, and started writing a lot of chamber music and orchestral stuff for the concert stage. Actually, at one point, I was thinking of getting a Ph.D. and going in that direction, because I was doing pretty well with it. I'm really very glad that I didn't, because right after I graduated, the market for university professors fell out ¿ it really collapsed. I had a lot of friends who were getting Ph.D.'s at UCLA and went out there, and there was nothing¿ they had no place to go. All the universities were downsizing. Anyway, my main composition teacher was Henri Lazarof, and I was also studying orchestration and conducting with Albert Harris.\n\nAfter I got out of college, Harris introduced me to Joe Harnell, who was scoring a TV show called The Incredible Hulk at the time. He started throwing some stuff my way on that show, and that kind-of got me going as an orchestrator. Later on I worked for Mark Snow as well.\n\nPLUME: When you say, \"Throwing some stuff\" your way, what work did that entail?\n\nDAVIS: Joe was writing 30 minutes of music a week for that show, and he had a couple of orchestrators working for him. By \"throwing some stuff,\" I mean that he auditioned me as an orchestrator, so to speak. He had a 30 second sketch of a cue that he asked me orchestrate just to see how I did, and I think he was ready to replace it if I really screwed it up bad. After that, he had me orchestrate for him every week.\n\nPLUME: What exactly is entailed in orchestration? What is the difference between a composer and an orchestrator?\n\nDAVIS: That's really an ongoing argument, because there's sort-of a fine line there. It's pretty easy to hand an orchestrator a sketch that doesn't have anything on it ¿ if you know what I'm saying. The classical concept of orchestrator is someone who takes a piano piece and makes it into an orchestral piece. One of the best examples of that sort of thing is a piece called \"Pictures at an Exhibition, which was a piano piece composed by Mussorsky, that Ravel later orchestrated for full orchestra. It became the paradigm of that kind of orchestration ¿ taking a piano piece and translating that music into something that works for an orchestra. Traditionally, film composers have been expected to write the music, but they haven't necessarily been expected to make that translation to the orchestra. That bit of expertise has been left to another set of professionals who are used to making that translation. On a technical standpoint, the sketches that I got from Joe Harnell were a little more dressed up than just piano music, but they were shortened versions of an orchestral score, and the orchestrator was expected to flesh that out.\n\nThere's a two-fold task for orchestrators: the important thing is that they make the piece of music sound well for an orchestra ¿ which takes a certain amount of expertise and experience. The second thing is to prepare the score for performance ¿ which means that the parts need to be laid out so the copyist can prepare each part for each player. Then, when it's recorded, the conductor will rehearse it with the orchestra and record it with the film, and if the orchestration was professionally done, it will require a minimum of rehearsal and take the least amount of time to make it sound well, so that they can get the score recorded under budget. That aspect is becoming lost these days. Often, music departments will question the amount of money that orchestrators are charging, not really realizing that if they're utilizing the services of a highly professional orchestrator, the cost of recording will diminish drastically, because there are few problems when the piece is rehearsed and recorded.\n\nPLUME: Would you liken it to a coach making up a playbook and giving it to an assistant coach to assign to the roles in each play to the players on the team?\n\nDAVIS: I'm not sure about that¿ That sounds more like choreography. That might sound more like what a conductor would do, because a conductor would actually go out there and inspire the players to perform, as a coach would inspire the athletes to do their best. That involves dealing with the personnel and putting the right person in the right job and things like that. Let me see if I can think of a good analogy, because there really aren't many¿ If you're talking about a really professional composer, like John Williams, the orchestrator is more like an editor. If John Williams were an author, and he sent the manuscript of his novel to his publisher, the editor would go through it for page layout, look for a mistakes ¿ and probably not find any in John Williams' case ¿ and just make sure it's laid out properly for printing. Sometimes editors ¿ if the novelist is less experienced ¿ will make suggestions in terms of maybe dropping some material or changing the syntax in a sentence or two, or something like that. In the worst case scenario, what an editor would get is a tape recording of a so-called author who's making up a novel on the fly and is just dictating into a tape recorder, and then the editor has to actually make that into some kind of book. We all know that happens now and then. There's always this on-going, underlying controversy as to who really wrote the music when there's an orchestrator involved.\n\nPLUME: Would you say that orchestration is a thankless job when looked at by those who don't know exactly what orchestrators do?\n\nDAVIS: It's certainly something out of the limelight. Amongst people who don't know what orchestrators do, he might as well be sitting there planting corn or something. As far as thankless jobs ¿ it can be lucrative. It can be satisfying, musically. Usually, if the composer is a decent person, at least he will give credit where credit is due. I think it's a great way to make a living, and there aren't that many ways to make a living in music, and it's an honest way to make a living. I think it's an honorable profession.\n\nPLUME: Personally, how do you derive satisfaction from orchestration from an artistic standpoint?\n\nDAVIS: I got started doing it very young, and I was fortunate to get started doing it when there was work to be had. In other words, in the late '70's/early '80's, most TV shows were done with a live orchestra and it was cranked out every week. The advantage that I had was that I was able to learn about the orchestra and really understand it by doing it and hearing it back almost immediately. That kind of experience is incredibly valuable. The unfortunate thing is that young composers and orchestrators aren't afforded that luxury anymore, because the vast majority of TV shows are done with synthesizers now. That's a completely different kind of musical experience. I'm starting to fear ¿ at least as far as the studios are concerned ¿ that orchestration is becoming a lost art.\n\nPLUME: Do they not understand what they're losing?\n\nDAVIS: That depends on who \"they\" are. Among studio players, they're seeing the art go away and they understand what is being lost. Among people who hire musicians ¿ producers and directors ¿ yeah, I don't think they're aware that the art is being lost, and, frankly, it isn't their responsibility to keep the art up. Their responsibility is to shoot great film and get it ready for an audience to perceive in the best possible way. They're not worried about, \"Oh, there's an art of orchestration that we have to maintain here.\" You know what I mean?\n\nPLUME: Do you think there's also a difference between \"old-guard\" composers and up-and-coming composers in their belief in the importance of orchestration? Do you think a lot of people coming up don't see a need for it, or prefer to do it themselves?\n\nDAVIS: If they prefer to do it themselves, then they understand it and they see a need for it. If they choose to do it themselves, then that means they have a high respect for it, high enough that they don't want to trust anybody else to do it, which is kind-of the way I am. I like to orchestrate my own things whenever I can.\n\nPLUME: And you also have the skills to do it¿\n\nDAVIS: Yes, and because of my early experience, I have the background to do it as well. I think what's starting to happen now is that there's a certain group of people who ¿ and I think it's human nature to want to ¿ do things the easy way¿to take the easy way out, and I think there always were. In music, they'd come up and they really didn't want to pay their dues, they'd just wanted to get the accolades. Before there was technology that enabled them to function without having learned their craft, those people were weeded out fairly fast. Now what's happening ¿ because of synthesizers and sequencers and all that sort of thing ¿ is that those people aren't getting weeded out. There's a proliferation of successful composers who really aren't of the attitude that they have to develop an expertise. I think that's really what it is.\n\nPLUME: Is it just a general lack of understanding fueled by laziness?\n\nDAVIS: Well, a lack of understanding and laziness coupled with the technology to enable them to function.\n\nPLUME: Speaking of your TV work, it's said that Mark Snow really doesn't like to talk about his early work in TV ¿ like Hart to Hart and T.J. Hooker. Do you have that same kind of aversion in regards to talking about your early TV work?\n\nDAVIS: I've come to a point in my life where I can't really care if somebody knows that I once scored an episode of Hart to Hart. If that's going to change somebody's perception of who I am or what I can do, then there's nothing I can do about that. I think, in Mark Snow's case, that the work he's been doing lately is of so much of a higher profile than what he did in his early years, that he'd rather have people concentrate on what he's doing now and forget that he ever scored Hart to Hart. When Hart to Hart was happening, it was a hit show. It was very exciting, Mark wrote great music for it¿\n\nPLUME: So it's not a matter of embarrassment as much as it's, \"Look what I'm doing now¿\"\n\nDAVIS: I think so, and he's doing great work now. Very different work than what he was doing then. I think it's also that Mark doesn't want to become the kind of guy who sits around in an old-folk's home talking about what he did 60 years-ago. What Mark's doing right now is really happening, and that's what's important.\n\nPLUME: How long were you orchestrating for these TV shows?\n\nDAVIS: Before I broke through?\n\nPLUME: Yeah¿\n\nDAVIS: I guess by \"break\" it means you go up a plateau in your career. My first big break would be in '87 when I started scoring episodes of Beauty and the Beast. I'd been orchestrating for about eight years prior to that.\n\nPLUME: How did your transition from orchestration into composing come about? How does that happen in the industry's eyes?\n\nDAVIS: The difference between a composer and an orchestrator is that, as far as producers and directors are concerned, a composer is the guy they talk to and the guy that shows up at the spotting sessions and decides where the music is going to go, and then, at the scoring sessions, he's the guy that conducts and tells everybody what to do. That's a pretty major distinction, from their point of view.\n\nHow I came to transcend the role of orchestrator was due to Lee Holdridge. Lee had scored the pilot episode of Beauty and the Beast and he also wrote the theme, and I think he had an agreement to score about seven episodes and then he would move on to something else, but he wanted to name his successor so that he could at least maintain the quality ¿ as he saw it ¿ of the music he had established. Through a series of events, he determined that I was to be that person. It was Lee who basically told the producers who his successor was going to be, and that's how I was able to break through and become visible, as far as the people who were actually hiring composers were concerned.\n\nPLUME: Was it an easy transition for you, going in to composing? You had done it before, right?\n\nDAVIS: Yeah. It's what I had been preparing to do since I was in college, so it wasn't like I had to suddenly figure out what to do¿ I knew what to do. I had scored episodes of Hart to Hart prior to that. I was working closely with Mark Snow, and when he would do a movie-of-the-week or something and wasn't available to score Hart to Hart, he was in a position to tell the producers who was going to do the next show ¿ so I had some experience. I had also scored a movie called Hyperspace, and it was the demo tape from Hyperspace, actually, that got me into Beauty and the Beast. I think that was the key to it. Once I started doing Beauty and the Beast, it wasn't like my only experience was orchestration, although that's the way I made a living. Some composers feel that it's a bad idea to go into orchestration, because if you do that, you'll be pegged as an orchestrator and you'll do that for the rest of your life ¿ which is not good if you really want to be a composer. My feeling about that is that if you turn down orchestration just to turn it down, you're not going to become known as a composer ¿ you're just going to become known as the guy who never works. I always felt that I needed to make a living, and I still feel that way.\n\nPLUME: That's definitely not a bad feeling to have¿\n\nDAVIS: Well, you know, hunger is a great thing, really. Hunger is what makes people professional.\n\nPLUME: And sometimes it's the only thing that motivates someone¿\n\nDAVIS: It's a big motivator. I've seen a lot of people who weren't hungry ¿ who had a lot of talent ¿ and that talent was squandered because they didn't have a need¿they didn't have the desire. Desire is the most important thing for anybody in any kind of entertainment work, because it's so hard to get work and so hard to do the work and keep the work and maintain a career that, if you're not really obsessed with wanting to succeed, you're really not going to. I think that's true for directors and writers and actors ¿ actors in particular.\n\nPLUME: What are the difficulties inherent in scoring for television?\n\nDAVIS: The biggest difficulty is the time factor. Television has always been a low-budget medium ¿ to a certain extent. Even when there's a lot of money floating around in TV, there's never much time. They always make deals that eliminate the luxury of time¿deals with networks in terms of delivery dates and the kind of money they have. If they have ten million dollars to score a mini-series or something, they're going to make that work by keeping people off the payroll. They only hire people for a few weeks, and that's how they can afford to make that kind of production work. The big problem with television has always been two-fold: first of all, there isn't enough time, and secondly, there's almost never enough money to do something really great. In terms of really great, I mean having a decent-sized orchestra.\n\nPLUME: Do you think, also, that sometimes the music is seen as an afterthought to the production?\n\nDAVIS: That's certainly the case, because if it wasn't an afterthought, they would give it more time and spend more money. That's pretty much the problem. The other problem is that, over the years, composers have made it work within the time and budget constraints. I've said for a long time that if you do more than is expected of you, pretty soon more will be expected of you.\n\nPLUME: Then it won't be seen as more¿\n\nDAVIS: Right¿ \"Well, you did it last time.\" The hard thing about TV is that you've go to write really fast and you have to make a small orchestra sound big. The great thing about TV is that the restrictions separate the boys from the men. Working on The Incredible Hulk with Joe Harnell and Hart to Hart with Mark Snow was like boot camp. It can really give a composer some real discipline, so that's the big challenge of scoring TV.\n\nCLICK HERE to jump to the second installment of Ken's interview with Don Davis – in which Davis discusses his work on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the differences between scoring for film and television, and scoring for animation, including his work on Tiny Toon Adventures."
