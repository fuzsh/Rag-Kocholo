        "text": "Something Hans said in another thread about not self consciously trying to make art in his film scores got me to thinking about what I would classify as perhaps the last artistic achievement in music for a blockbuster film (because Oscar nominated dramas always garner praise for their artistic scores).\n\nDavis' Matrix Trilogy might just be that for me. It's deeply complex, has a dramatic and stylistic breadth but never garnered that many copy-cats (probably because it was too damned hard to rip off!). Yeah, the minimalist sections borrowed from John Adams' Harmonielehre and Short Ride in a Fast Machine (both kick ass pieces if anyone is interested). but the way Davis weaved everything together is pretty marvellous. There's also a significant development of key ideas from the first instalment through to the final film where the climax musically is just that. There is a long build and when Neo allows Agent Smith to take him over, the music recaps the climactic sequence from the first film but pushes it further with wordless chorus doing a bombastic Phil Glass staggered chord thing. It's pretty amazing both in the film and listening to it on its own.\n\nI also respect that Davis teamed with electronic musicians to provide that cross pollination of styles. I still have an issue of EQ where they interviewed him about the process of scoring those films. They also included some Digital Performer examples.\n\nAnyone else dig these scores? Would love to get my hands on the conductor's scores for them. have to be massive and dense!\n\nThe first Matrix is probably the last blockbuster I really enjoyed and could watch it again.\n\nAt the time it came out I remember liking the score but not loving it enough to listen to after the film. With the passing years that has changed and is definitely a score I keep coming back to because it still feels as refreshing as the movie is.\n\n\"Unable to Speak\" hits me everytime\n\nI find Revolutions to be Davis' masterpiece because its the culmination of the three scores.\n\nHowever as soon as I heard that alternating minor chords in the horns and trumpets in the opening of the first film I was like \"yeah that's cool\". That became the signature for the whole series.\n\nAgain it did recall a lick that John Adams used in one of his '80s concert works but I didn't care. Well I think I almost asked Adams after a concert he gave in Detroit I 2000 whether he'd seen the film and what he thought of the music but I thought better of it.\n\nAdams actually spoke with me for a good 10-15 minutes and this was after he conducted his own Harmonium that evening. Nice, smart fellow.\n\nI did speak with him about film scoring and all I will say is that he didn't think much of a lot of music coming out of Hollywood. I think he said in an interview once when asked if he thought there were a lot of good composers and he replied \"there are a lot of rich composers in Hollywood\".\n\nPity because I'd love to see what he'd do with a good film project.\n\nOne of my all time favorite scores. I still listen, analyze and enjoy them on a regular basis. And I see the trilogy at least once a year. I love the music, the orchestration but most of all how Davis scores to picture, managing to flawlessly connect complex motifs, rhythmical ideas and sometimes just patterns with the story arc, emotions and characters, scene after scene. And even if you don't like the music, it's still a great material to listen for better understanding of what a great orchestra can do.\n\nFor those of you who like The Matrix trilogy score, be sure to listen to Don Davis'es opera \"Rio De Sangre\". I find it amazing and brilliant. Some of the ideas that he developed on Matrix are present here too, but more elaborate and much more fleshed out.\n\nAs for the thought of Matrix being the last \"artistic\" block buster score, I'm not sure I agree with that. I see \"Man Of Steel\" every bit as artistic as \"The Matrix\". Different language, different ideas, different approach sure, but that doesn't make it less artistic in my opinion. And even what you meant by \"more artistic\" is actually \"a more unique sound\" you still have \"V For Vendetta\", \"Cloud Atlas\" and some of Beltrami's blockbusters.\n\nI hope Don Davis comes back to movie scoring again, even for a bit. =)\n\nalex\n\nAnyone else dig these scores? Would love to get my hands on the conductor's scores for them. have to be massive and dense!\n\nI'm a big fan of the Matrix Score as well - from the very beginning when I saw the first movie (which was quite late actually). But three (?) years ago I visited the \"Matrix Live\" concert and it was awesome to watch the orchestra playing the score. Damn I knew so less about orchestration back then. :wink:\n\nI would buy the score sheets if available.\n\nAh, cool - thanks Lex for the hint with the opera. I'll check it out soon.\n\nWhen John Williams wasn't able to score Jurassic Park III because of scheduling, the guy he recommended in his place was Don Davis. I'm disappointed however that Davis is not as active in composing as he once was. His work was compelling.\n\nAs much as thinking about a Matrix reboot makes my stomach quiver.. the thought of possibly hearing Don Davis do his own reboot to the score evens those feelings out.\n\nGood thing Keanu Reaves doesn't seem to age.. they probably have a good 20+ years to shoot #4.\n\nI heard a rumor that Davis wasn't that easy to work with on the Matrix Trilogy and at one point, the Wachowski Bros considered replacing him for the Reload and Revolutions. Thank God they didn't!\n\nIt kind of brings up another topic about composer's abilities vs temperaments. Some of the greatest composers in history were quite irascible. I know Goldsmith had somewhat of contempt for his fans and Herrmann was notorious for breaking into rages over various things. I think I even heard a story where he berated Goldsmith for using orchestrators on his scores but then turned around and told Jerry that one of his cues (cannot remember the film) was \"too good\" to use in the movie and that he should have kept it for himself.\n\nQuestion is-what would you prefer? A decent composer with a nice disposition or an awesome composer who probably has some temperament issues as far as interpersonal skills goes. I know it's evident that we are seeing less of the latter these days. Anyone with a perceived ego no matter how amazing their skills are is not above being replaced in the 11th hour. too many scores come to mind.\n\nThe first Matrix is probably the last blockbuster I really enjoyed and could watch it again.\n\nAt the time it came out I remember liking the score but not loving it enough to listen to after the film. With the passing years that has changed and is definitely a score I keep coming back to because it still feels as refreshing as the movie is.\n\n\"Unable to Speak\" hits me everytime\n\nThe first Matrix was extraordinary on every level. Shame it didn't stop there imo, from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nI must confess I under-appreciated Davis' score at the time, I was so focused on the brilliant use of the 3rd party tracks, especially the much parodied Propellerheads. But yeah, it's a fantastic score which adds so much to the movie.\n\nAnd a very interesting comment, Frederick.\n\nI heard a rumor that Davis wasn't that easy to work with on the Matrix Trilogy and at one point, the Wachowski Bros considered replacing him for the Reload and Revolutions. Thank God they didn't!\n\nI don't know where you heard it but it isn't true. They did ask Don to collaborate with Juno Reactor on a couple of cues for the sequels, but replacing him was never considered.\n\nWachowski movies are probably the only topic on this forum where I feel I can assert authority. I've worked with them in the music department on several of their projects over the years. I was in the room with the orchestra at Newman Scoring Stage for the recording of the Revolutions score and I count that as one if the most fortunate events of my life.\n\nI heard a rumor that Davis wasn't that easy to work with on the Matrix Trilogy and at one point, the Wachowski Bros considered replacing him for the Reload and Revolutions.

I really enjoyed those scores and wish Davis got more scoring assignments subsequent to that trilogy."
