        "text": "When Alabama Music Hall of Famer Don Davis was a child in\n\nthe late 1930s, a country music band played at his school in\n\nSatsuma. One of its members leaned over a flat keyboard that\n\nhe plucked -- a steel, or Hawaiian, guitar -- and the boy was\n\ncaptivated by the metallic yet melodic sound.\n\n\"It made my hair stand on end,\" Davis says at his\n\nhouse in Gulf Shores. \"I realized, 'I've got\n\nto do that.'\"\n\nSoon young Don found a musician to give him a couple of\n\nlessons, using a Spanish guitar turned flat. \"After I\n\ngot hot on it,\" he says, \"my parents bought me an\n\nelectric Hawaiian guitar for $39.95 from Sears-Roebuck.\n\nWe'd just gotten electricity. There was an electric\n\ncord on the porch up to a light. I'd unplug that cord\n\nand plug in my amplifier. The cows would come and hear the\n\nracket. They kind of liked it.\" For Davis, turning 80 this month, a steel guitar opened the\n\ndoor to country music glamour and fame. He played with\n\nfamous, old-time bands like Pee Wee King and the Golden\n\nCowboys, plucked strings as a studio musician in thousands\n\nof recordings, and worked later as a producer.\n\nWith his flowing white hair and goatee, and rose-tinted\n\nglasses, Davis holds forth on topics like the Grand Ol'\n\nOpry, fellow entertainers Minnie Pearl and Hank Snow, and\n\nthe craft of steel guitar -- although he's refused to\n\nplay one for years.\n\nHe has enjoyed a colorful personal life, too, having been\n\nmarried to Anita Carter, one of the singing Carter sisters\n\n(Johnny Cash was married to sister June Carter). The couple\n\nlived in Satsuma from 1958 to 1963, and later divorced.\n\nDavis has been with his current wife, Serilda, 56, since the\n\n1980s.\n\n\"We're a lowly bunch,\" he teases of\n\n\"steelers,\" the term for steel guitar players.\n\n\"I never did know a rich steel guitar picker.\"\n\nWhen he was a boy in Calvert, Davis' family was\n\n\"poor but didn't know it.\"\n\nSome of the first music he experienced came from his\n\ngrandfather who \"played a five-string banjo and made\n\nwhiskey and sang dirty songs,\" he says.\n\nHe was inspired by the music of \"the singing\n\ncowboy,\" Gene Autry, and movie cowboys Lash LaRue and\n\nWild Bill Elliott, whose exploits he enjoyed at the Century\n\nTheater in Mobile.\n\nAfter leaving school at 14 to labor in the Mobile shipyards,\n\nhe took off to Nashville, Tenn., where his musical gifts\n\npaid off.\n\nThe 1940s were an early heyday of country music. As Serilda\n\nDavis remembers of going to the Grand Ol' Opry as a\n\nchild in the 1950s: \"It was like heaven.\"\n\nDon Davis recalls his first appearance at the Opry with Pee\n\nWee King. \"I was shaking,\" he says, but that\n\ntranslated into a vibrating sound on the guitar, an effect\n\nPee Wee King liked.\n\n\"It quivers,\" Serilda Davis remarks of her\n\nhusband's sound, which she has heard only on vintage\n\nrecordings.\n\nAfter a stint in the Army, Davis returned to Nashville to\n\nwork and fun -- \"I was just as wild as you could\n\nget,\" he says impishly -- and in 1953 married Anita\n\nCarter. Their lives together, he says, suffered under the\n\ndemands of touring. \"It got to the point people would\n\nhave to introduce us,\" he says.\n\nIn the late 1950s, popular music began to change. On the\n\nscene were Elvis, the Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul, and\n\nMary. The era of \"fiddle and steel\" was under the\n\nlong shadow of folk music and rock'n' roll.\n\n\"You could take the whole Grand Ol' Opry and\n\nwouldn't enough people show up to start a fight,\"\n\nhe jokes.\n\nWhen Davis and Carter moved to Mobile, he hosted a TV show,\n\n\"Alabama Jubilee,\" that ran mornings on WKRG.\n\nThe couple had two children, both of whom live in Tennessee\n\ntoday.\n\nDavis says he and former brother-in-law Johnny Cash\n\n\"got along pretty good.\"\n\nDavis brought the Shel Silverstein lyrics, \"A Boy Named\n\nSue,\" to Cash, who was looking for new material at the\n\ntime.\n\nAs Cash wrote of it in his autobiography, \"Man In\n\nBlack,\" \"'Bring it on out,' I said,\n\nthinking Don Davis must be wrong this time. It sounded like\n\nsomething I knew I wouldn't want.\"\n\n\"A Boy Named Sue\" became one of Cash's\n\nbiggest hits.\n\nAfter returning to Nashville from Mobile, Davis began to\n\nfocus on the business side of music. He says that, during\n\nrecording sessions, he had come to realize \"the guy on\n\nthe other side of the glass was making more than me,\n\nproducing.\"\n\nThen, after decades of doing what he loved, \"I hung up\n\nmy gloves. Now I'm a surfer. I sit right in that\n\nchair\" -- he says, pointing to his easy chair --\n\n\"and surf the channels.\"\n\nHe loves to reminisce, and is working with a Tennessee\n\nwriter on his memoirs, \"From Nashville to Mobile.\"\n\nBut he claims to not miss playing music. \"I don't\n\neven listen to the radio.\"\n\nEven as he maintains he has no samples of his guitar\n\nplaying, Serilda Davis quietly walks to the bedroom and\n\nreturns with a CD of four songs from 1946 -- recordings of\n\nthe Pee Wee King band with singer Cowboy Copas.\n\nThe songs feature Davis on the steel guitar, and Pee Wee\n\nKing on a \"squeeze box,\" as Davis calls it.\n\nSerilda puts the CD into a portable player and turns up the\n\nvolume. Davis' smooth, melodic, quivery, trembly steel\n\nguitar sounds rise through the house.\n\nDavis' hands move on the table, the fingers of his\n\nright hand tapping. But then he makes it evident he's\n\njust clearing papers.\n\n\"Young people aren't interested in that kind of\n\nmusic anymore,\" he says with resignation.\n\nBut the music of the old country band keeps on."
