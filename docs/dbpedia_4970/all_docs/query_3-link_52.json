I then happened to search online and came across an auction that had the reels! … but it ended over a week ago, so I was pretty bummed out about it , but I realized that there were quite a number of George reels that were auctioned over the past few years by Carolina Soul Records, in relation to the estate of Don Davis (Groovesville Productions, Detroit, MI).\n\nI was surprised no one brought it up here, so I decided to compile a list of the tracks on the reels.
