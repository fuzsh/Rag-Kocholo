        "text": "By ,\n\nWhere does a successful film and television composer turn when he is looking for a new challenge? To opera, of course.\n\nWhen the curtain rises Friday evening on the Florentine Opera's world-premiere performance of Don Davis' \"Rio de Sangre (River of Blood),\" it will also be rising on the two-time Emmy award-winning composer's first foray into the world of opera.\n\n\"I didn't want to be on my deathbed saying, 'What if I had written an opera,' \" Davis said in a phone interview. The California native has been in Milwaukee for the past couple of weeks, taking part in the final rehearsals for the premiere.\n\n\"Rio de Sangre,\" directed by Paula Suozzi, will obviously be new to audiences, but we have been surrounded by Davis' music for decades, including the scores to the three \"Matrix\" films, orchestrations for the film \"Titanic,\" scores for such television series as \"Beauty and the Beast\" and individual episodes of such shows as \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\"\n\nAlthough he finds a correlation between writing for films and writing opera, particularly in creating music that elucidates and supports dramatic situations, writing an opera has been a much different challenge.\n\n\"Saying that I've written an opera is much more defining than saying I've written however many film scores,\" he said. \"It's much more of a defining moment for a composer.\"\n\n\"Opera is really a composer's medium,\" he continued, \"especially when the genesis of the idea comes from the composer. Its success is the composer's success, and its failure rests squarely on the composer's shoulders.\"\n\nHe will be acutely aware of that responsibility as critics and aficionados from around the country gather in Milwaukee for the premiere.\n\nDavis has been thinking about the opera project for just over 20 years, pulling together elements he wanted to include.\n\n\"I didn't want to write it in English. English just doesn't sing very well,\" he said, explaining the decision to write it in Spanish.\n\n\"Spanish is an immensely lyrical language,\" Davis said. \"When you hear people speaking it, it almost sounds like they're singing. That decision led me to doing something in Latin America. From there it wasn't too hard to come up with the concept of making a statement about Latin American political situations and the long history of political oppression.\"\n\n\"Rio de Sangre\" is set in a fictional Latin American country, which Davis helps define with a salsa band on the stage and the sounds of merengue music, and is placed in a generically 20th-century era.\n\nHe kept what he calls \"a box full of ideas,\" including a riot (inspired by the Rodney King riots Davis witnessed in L.A.) and a nightclub assassination, and eventually turned them over to the opera's librettist, Kate Gale.\n\nCalling their work a \"fruitful and true collaboration,\" he said she wove a compelling, coherent story from his box of ideas. The result is a highly charged story of political and personal upheaval with visual elements akin to \"Evita.\"\n\nFor a full synopsis of the opera, visit www.riodesangre.com/synopsis. The page also offers some samples of the opera's music.\n\nFlorentine's mission\n\nStaging the world premiere of an opera is no small feat, but as the Florentine's general director William Florescu explained, \"If opera is going to remain a viable, living art form, someone has to do these things for the first time. Someone had to stage \"Tosca\" for the first time, too.\"\n\nHe said he sees staging new works as part of the Florentine's mission, along with giving newer works a second airing, as was the case with last year's production of \"Elmer Gantry.\"\n\nFlorescu explained that with opera being the most expensive of the performing arts to produce, there's always risk involved with premieres. He said, \"If the critics or the public don't like it, they don't give you a lot of credit for doing it.\"\n\nBut critical and public reactions to opera premieres aren't always the last word.\n\n\"It's important to keep in mind that people didn't necessarily get some of the great operatic masterpieces we love today right out of the chute,\" he said.\n\nWill it succeed?\n\nBut that's part of the excitement of seeing an opera premiere: forming an opinion. You can love it, hate it, be conflicted about and talk about it for weeks afterward. The opera may succeed or fail immediately, or perhaps limp along for years and then disappear or become a hit. No one knows.\n\nFor the sake of argument, try to guess which opera a Boston critic described with the following words: \"exceedingly, even ingeniously ugly . . . ear-flaying succession of chords . . . rawboned and hideous.\"\n\nThe answer? \"Tosca.\"\n\n***\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Florentine Opera's world premiere production of \"Rio de Sangre\"\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 22 and 23, 2:30 p.m. Oct. 24\n\nWhere: Marcus Center's Uihlein Hall, 929 N. Water St."
