        "text": "Davis is known for scoring the Matrix trilogy of films. His opera, with a libretto by poet/novelist Kate Gale, is about a dictator in a fictional Latin American country, and as yet there is no date set for its staged premiere.\n\nThe program for the November 6 performance of the Rio de sangre suite will also include Faur_'s Requiem.\n\nThe season also includes a minimalist program on March 26 featuring works by Meredith Monk, Arvo Pâ€¹rt, and Michael Torke, as well as performances of Verdi's Requiem on March 12 and 14.\n\nThe Los Angeles Master Chorale was founded in 1964 by Roger Wagner. It has been under the direction of Grant Gershon since 2001 and has performed at Walt Disney Concert Hall since 2003."
