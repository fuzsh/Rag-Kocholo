        "text": "Not to be controversial or anything, just curious why he won't be back for the franchise. I think is very clear that the music for the Matrix is iconic and unique, and I am sure the new composer will do amazing.\n\nCheers\n\nMost likely reasons based on his IMDB page:\n\nNot interested in doing more Matrix stuff. There is a LOT of Matrix titles in his IMDB page beyond the movies.\n\nCommitted to another movie/show (less likely since he's been pretty quiet outside of a few recent works)\n\nNot interested in scoring movies\n\nHas grown to dislike the Wachowski brothers (pure speculation with no substance)\n\nI've never heard anything sound like Don Davis mixed with Juno Reactor, I hope the new composer can atleast immitate the style and complexity...\n\nThere is the FYC available to hear the score. From what I’ve heard, it pales in comparison to Davis’ original franchise scores.\n\nMatrix 1 was a masterpiece score (and movie). It was the whole reason I purchased a DVD player because of the score only track and composer commentary.\n\nGo get the dvd if you haven’t listened to the composer audio track, it’s a great lecture and he doesn’t step on the cues with his commentary.\n\nStrictly personal opinions, here.\n\nI wonder if the Wachowskis' movies after Matrix deserve the music of Don Davis. There was Cloud Atlas, half a masterwork, with the excellent soundtrack of Tom Tykwer (et al.), a better film director himself.\n\nV for Vendetta, a movie that I personally can't stand for the overdose of rhetoric and the too many dead plot points, could boast a great soundtrack from Dario Marianelli, that was itself much better than the movie.\n\nRightly so, Jupiter Ascending was scored by Giacchino. Maybe the next project will not be less convoluted than that one, and there will be a composer that will fit better than Davis with the film's style.\n\nPaolo\n\nMatrix 1 was a masterpiece score (and movie). It was the whole reason I purchased a DVD player because of the score only track and composer commentary.\n\nGo get the dvd if you haven’t listened to the composer audio track, it’s a great lecture and he doesn’t step on the cues with his commentary.\n\nThanks man I never knew this.I've have the dvd for years will check it out!\n\nThough it's still speculation as to why DD did not return (he has said in previous interviews that his music to the Matrix franchise means alot to him- I know he was very involved in some of the concerts) it also isn't a complete shock that they went with Tywker and Klimek- the Wachowski's have been close to Tom for awhile and Klimek has been working with him for decades (though, speaking of 'why's' it's also interesting to note that Reinhold Heil won't be joining them).\n\nAt any rate, if a reboot of the scale and pedigree of Resurrections isn't going to draw Davis back to scoring films, he likely has punched out from the whole Hollywood composer thing (eh, more power to him...)\n\nI don't want to open any kind of can of worms here and know its been mentioned but I feel it's important to reiterate as a baseline as this thread continues that Lana and Lilly Wachowski are both trans women. It would be respectful to those members of the forum that may not be cisgender to be sensitive to that.\n\nEDIT: not pointing at anyone in specific, just setting the baseline for the convo moving forward.\n\nStrictly personal opinions, here.\n\nI wonder if the Wachowskis' movies after Matrix deserve the music of Don Davis.

I ALMOST asked him what his thoughts were on Davis' Matrix but good judgment got the better of me."
