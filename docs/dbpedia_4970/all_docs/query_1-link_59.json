        "text": "Don Davis is a virtuoso film and television composer known for his horn-heavy, oftentimes unconventional compositions. Davis's career came full circle when, 17 years after he parodied John Williams's famous \"Star Wars\" score with an orchestration for the 1984 low-budget spoof \"Hyperspace,\" he was recommended personally by Williams to take over musical responsibilities on \"Jurassic Park II.\" In the interim, Davis proved to be an accessible-yet-avant-garde tunesmith capable of layering an aural patina on anything from a children's series (\"Tiny Toons Adventures\") to a grisly horror movie (\"The House on Haunted to Hill\"). In 1996, the instrumentally creative composer established a partnership with filmmaking duo Larry and Andy Wachowski on the Sapphic noir-flavored thriller \"Bound.\" Their follow-up collaboration, \"The Matrix,\" marked one of Davis's most groundbreaking achievements. His compositions for the sci-fi blockbuster, its sequels, and the animated spin-off anthology \"The Animatrix\" have been widely recognized for their experimentally polytonal nature, taking cacophonous risks to thrilling results. Among his many credits, Davis has produced similarly abstract, rip-roaring scores for such actioners as the brute chase movie \"The Marine\" and the stealthy wartime-survival adventure \"Behind Enemy Lines.\""
