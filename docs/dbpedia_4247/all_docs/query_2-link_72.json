        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nJoseph Stalin (1878-1953 in a Polish prison - March) was married to a Catholic woman (belonging to a religious community persecuted by his state). Although he negotiated aspects of this bond with the pope Pius XII, he was a man with numerous mistresses, following Boris Borisovich Kolymagin's account. The name of Kolymagin is not unknown; he was deported from his native country (and from abroad, through the NKVD), survived a long sentence in the car of the GULag, spent the remaining years in a shared room with VV Vinogradov, at the Institute of General Physics, Academician at the USSR Academy of Sciences, the oldest in Moscow. He also wrote of what would have happened at the three great festivals of Russian intellectual creativity in the twentieth century, or the Congress of Soviets and the International Union of Protection of Culture (ICC). Unlike the Russian oppositionists who offered to testify to the tragedies of the Stalin era in the Russian Parliament and ended up shot or killed, his book seems to have been taken into account.\n\n1.1. Background and Context\n\nJoseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, was married twice and had a total of three children. It is believed that he also had several affairs during his marriage to his first wife, Kato Svanidze. With his second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, he had two children. Through this marriage, he became the grandfather of Yevgeni Dzhugashvili. Little information is well-known about the private life of this brutal leader. Yet, historians know that he had an extramarital affair with a housekeeper named Lidia Pereprygia. Out of his three children, only Vasily Jughashvili managed to survive long enough to follow his father in the period of the Second World War. All of his children, however, suffered. Data suggests that his wife and the affairs that Stalin had during their marriage had a great impact on his leadership and life overall as well. Stalin's first wife, Kato Svanidze, was married to him for a total of barely sixteen months. They were married in 1906 and she passed away in 1907. Over a century has passed since her death and yet, she is still the most mysterious wife of Joseph Stalin. Svanidze was only 23 years old when she died. Despite her premature death, she was quite important to her husband. He always said she was the love of his life, and Stalin was never able to forget her. Stalin's daughter once told a story about how he regarded Kato so much that he had actually never cleaned out the wardrobe of his first beloved. Three years after his first wife passed away, Stalin married again. His marriage to Nadezhda Alliluyeva did not last long either. They were married from 1919 to 1932. The three children of the two marriages of Joseph Stalin, where only one of his sons survived until adulthood, were Yakov Dzhugashvili, Vasili Dzhugashvili, and Svetlana Allilueva.\n\n2. Marriage to Ekaterina Svanidze\n\nEkaterina Svanidze, born 3 December 1885 in Tiflis, Tiflise Gubernia, Russian Empire, was Joseph Stalin's first wife. She was an ethnic Georgian. They first crossed paths when they were children, as their families lived next to each other, and her father was the same age as Stalin's mother, who had grown up next to the Svanidze family. They were married on 27 July 1906. Stalin and Svanidze attended a formal church wedding with the interpreter Maria Kuzakova, who was a relative of Svanidze. Galina, a relative of Stalin's, and a groom were present at the dinner. Otherwise, there were only three witnesses: a dentist in the Iverski temple and three members of the Gori police, all witnesses to the key fact that the bride's uncle was Lorenzo Koba, the married candidate's cousin. Together they had a son, Yakov Dzhugashvili. Svanidze suffered from tuberculosis, although she took part in demonstrations as a member of the Bolshevik Party looking for her predisposed husband. Tsarist authorities found the family's apartment and destroyed it. She died of typhus on 22 November 1907. Stalin was so devastated that he remained in bed for 10 or 14 days, and his heart hardened towards her family for years to come. He went to Mtskheta to follow her modestly attended funeral. Svanidze's sister, Maria, claimed on her deathbed that Svanidze was poisoned. Her family despised Stalin because, in a letter to them, he wrote that she had died of a broken heart and that he made a vow to see her family now and then. Her father would live with Stalin before he moved to Moscow, and Maria would live near Stalin's Kremlin office throughout World War II.\n\n2.1. Early Years Together\n\nJoseph and Kato had been acquainted for many years before their sudden decision to marry. Kato returned to Georgia from St. Petersburg in 1896, after her fiance Aleksis Karinyan had died. She moved in with her brother, and Joseph Dzhugashvili became a good friend of the family. Then Kato left for management courses in France, but during a vacation in Georgia in 1903 she returned to her former friends in Georgia and resumed her friendship with Joseph. Then in Tiflis (Tbilisi), Joseph Dzhugashvili was not mistaken in his choice. Kato Zakarina turned out to be very independent, a bit proud, demanding very little from people and himself, tactful, energetic, and persistent. She came from the same social stratum as Joseph himself, both were Orthodox Georgians who hated Russian imperialism and religious persecution. They had similar interests, tastes, and ideals. They had already been seeing a lot of each other in the autumn of 1903, and their passion couldn't have been that sudden or transcendent if they could not bother to wait even until the following spring. Still, Joseph and Kato got married one day and then fled Georgia the very next day. Kato Galitskaya was the future wife of Joseph Dzhugashvili until 1910. In 1894 she graduated from Mariinsky Railways College, and in 1895 - from the Electrotechnical School in Tiflis. She was a member of the Workers' Mutual Aid Society and was involved in Marxist study circles. She went to study at the Technical Institute in St. Petersburg in 1896, where she became a close friend of Alexander Ulyanov's wife. In 1899 she was expelled from St. Petersburg for attending a May Day meeting with her student friend Anyutin. From then on Kato lived in Tiflis and worked. From 1901 she was a copyist in her brother Alexander Galitsky's company. She was captured along with Joseph when she lived in Tiflis. Kato and Her Main Passion. It was a love match. One that came unexpectedly to everyone, including Young Stalin. Everyone who knew him wondered, even then and especially afterward, how it had all happened. It was so surprising, people said. No one had thought Young Stalin - whose secret romance everyone had smiled at in passing - would have married her. It was all so childish, those secret letters, the betrothal ceremony in the forest, explained Joseph Djugashvili. Everyone saw them go their separate ways when Kato returned from France and one day at a picnic Dmitriyev gloated to Joseph, reminding him that one shouldn't complain of the shackles of urbanity as one praised the innocent country life. The tinge of tacit mockery in those words stung Joseph. All of a sudden he realized that without Kato he felt somewhat lonesome, and even worse, people stared at him with a new expression of irony. The change suggested he was not taken very seriously by anyone, and those secret visits they had missed, their wasted and precious time was practically seen as a tattered illusion, a mere fling that had become tiresome, of no serious consequence to anyone. In a fit of passion, Joseph announced his betrothal. In 1903 a twelve-year-old girl named Annette, a friend of Kato's younger sister, crossed the road in Georgia as Joseph happened to come by, and for the first time he saw Kato as she sat on her father's porch. She was a beauty with blue eyes, gazing straight at him. Joseph was transfixed. When Kato and her sister went over to Annette's house, or the girls went out into town, they often saw Joseph following after them. They would laugh to each other; it was the source of much innocent fun. One afternoon Kato disappeared and left for Russian pensionnat. She was preparing to enter St. Petersburg University. Seven years later, Young Stalin found out with great astonishment that Kato had dropped out and returned to Tiflis. Joseph immediately went to offer her a job.\n\n3. Affairs and Relationships\n\nWhat was the personal life of Joseph Stalin and was it good? Joseph Stalin was a very secretive person and very little is known about his personal life. The most information is that his life had a few women who loved him, and Joseph Stalin was not such a good husband in return. Substantiation and evidence of such relations are often contradictory. There were many testimonies of those who sincerely believed that they saw nothing but sincere and friendly relations. They lived together, and there was nothing illegal about that. Moreover, on February 17, 1918, they were found to have been officially married. There is a theory that this happened at the desire of Stalin. By the time he was a literate person and signed a party card. It is known that he often beat M.S. They had a riot period. It is difficult to find traces of those years in their personal belongings; some of that time, the relationship is in the memories and testimonies. This family has for some time fallen out of view. The brightest moments are the officers' meetings at his apartment. The family somehow becomes legalized at the end of the war.\n\n3.1. Rumored Affairs\n\nThere are rumors about Ivanidze, Alliluyeva, and possible other affairs. But the fact is Joseph Stalin was married only once. This statement is confirmed in the numerous official documents in various state archives, the memories of witnesses, and is mentioned in the \"Small Soviet Encyclopedic Dictionary\" of 1959 and the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" of 1976. As a result, many sources, including sources questioning Stalin personally, date the Tolma Marriage to 1910. The Tolma marriage of Joseph Stalin in 1910 has not been denied, either in the USSR or in today's Russia. His bride, Kato, was several years older than Joseph, had already been married, and had a son. The Tolmas were a wealthy and influential family in the Caucasus before the revolution. The polygamous nature of the mountain peoples' customs in this form was allowed by current Russian law, and this marriage has been fully legal under Russian law. Such a marriage was a factor worthy of marriageability for a young man-jigit. There is information in the public domain about the fate of the Tolmas and the Tolmas after the revolution, which gives us an understanding of the further relationship of Joseph and Kato. In the history of Joseph Stalin, the Tolma family is often mentioned by many researchers."
