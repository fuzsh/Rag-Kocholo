        "text": "Svetlana Alliluyeva was allowed to stay in Switzerland for three months.\n\nShe went to the United States in April 1967.\n\nOn arrival at New York, she held a press conference and astonished the world by denouncing her father's regime - much to the irritation of the Soviet leader of the time, Alexei Kosygin, who said she was a \"sick person\".\n\nLater that year, she published her memoirs, Twenty Letters to a Friend, and another autobiography in 1969 called Only One Year.\n\nSvetlana became a US citizen and changed her name to Lana Peters when she married American architect, William Peters in 1970. But they separated after their daughter, Olga, was born.\n\nShe returned to the Soviet Union in 1984 and settled in Tbilisi, Georgia - her father's homeland."
