Originally Svetlana Stalina, she took her mother's surname after Stalin died (1953), and was a teacher and translator. In 1966, while returning her third husband's ashes to his native India, she defected to the West; she left a grown son and daughter from earlier marriages behind in the USSR. She settled (1967) in the United States, and published Twenty Letters to a Friend (1967, a memoir) and Only One Year (1969). In 1970 she married an American architect, William W. Peters, and afterwards was known as Lana Peters; they had a daughter but divorced in 1973. By then a U.S. citizen, she returned to the Soviet Union in 1984 and renounced her defection, but she left again in 1986 and subsequently lived in the United States and Europe.\n\nSee biography by R.
