Having known Stalin from a young age, she married him when she was 18, and they had two children.\n\nNadezhda worked as a secretary for Bolshevik leaders, including Vladimir Lenin and Stalin, before enrolling at the Industrial Academy in Moscow to study synthetic fibres and become an engineer.\n\nNadezhda had health issues, which had an adverse impact on her relationship with Stalin. She also suspected her husband was unfaithful, which led to frequent arguments with him. On several occasions, Nadezhda reportedly contemplated leaving Stalin, and after an argument, she fatally shot herself early in the morning of 9 November 1932.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia:Nadezhda_Alliluyeva\n\nSee also:\n\nThis WikiTree profile is referenced from Wikidata: Item Q233999, en:Wikipedia\n\nNadezhda Sergejevna \"Nadya\" Alliluyeva Stalina on Find A Grave: Memorial #7277 Retrieved 17:31, 21 April 2017 (EDT)."
