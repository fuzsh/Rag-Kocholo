        "text": "Nadezhda Alliluyeva was a Russian woman who had known Joseph Stalin since she was a child. He had saved her from drowning when she was a child. The Bolsheviks took power in Russia in November 1917 and she worked for Vladimir Lenin as a secretary before she was sent to aid Stalin. Stalin as first thought she had been sent to spy on him, but the two soon grew close and were later married. They went on to have two children, Vasily Stalin and Svetlana Alliluyeva. She also welcomed Stalin's son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, into their home and helped tutor him.\n\nStalin was hosting a party commemorating an anniversary of the October Revolution, when Nadezhda arrived and told Stalin she had a message for him. Stalin mocked her, saying how his wife is a messenger now. She told him how she had witnessed the starving people being rounded and and sent to Siberia and that an old woman had begged her to tell Stalin what was happening, because if he knew what was happening he would help them. Stalin laughed at this and then put his cigarette butt down her top. Nadezhda then stormed out and was followed by Zinaida Pavlutskaya Ordzhonikidze. Outside the two discussed Stalin and what Nadezhda should do. Zinaida suggested that maybe Nadezhda shold go away for a while and Nadezhda agreed that she should go away, and Nadezhda asked Zinaida to keep an eye on the children for her.\n\nNadezhda then returned home and committed suicide by shooting herself.\n\nNotes[]"
