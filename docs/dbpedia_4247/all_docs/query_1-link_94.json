        "text": "Don Harlacker heard about it from his cousin.\n\nIn a way, it made sense. But in another, it seemed fantastic, a kind of local myth that sprouted from a kernel of truth, one simple fact that grew into a local legend.\n\nThe story was that Joseph Stalin's daughter had lived, briefly, on a farm near East Berlin, a small town nestled amongst the rolling farmland on the border of York and Adams counties, far from the cities or centers of power.\n\nAnd that Stalin's daughter would wind up living near a small Pennsylvania town called East Berlin, with the connotations that name carries from history, seems like an odd coincidence, that she fled the oppression of the Soviet regime, an oppression largely constructed by her father, only to wind up living near a town whose name was a powerful symbol of that oppression.\n\nThe story begins Feb. 26, 1926 when Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was born in Moscow, the youngest and only daughter of Josef Stalin and Nadezhda Alliluyeva, the premier's second wife.\n\nHer mother died when Svetlana was 6, the official cause listed as appendicitis. She learned later that her mother had taken her own life, shooting herself in the head after an argument with Stalin at a dinner party. (There was also the suspicion that Stalin shot her himself.)\n\nShe was raised mostly by nannies and didn't see a lot of her father. Her father did use her as a political prop. In August 1942, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, visiting Stalin in his Moscow apartment, saw the girl and described her as \"a handsome red-haired girl who kissed her father dutifully,\" an appearance that seemed staged to Churchill, thinking that Stalin was trying to soften his image as an iron-fisted mass murderer.\n\nSvetlana had, shall we say, a complicated relationship with her father. You could imagine that growing up with Stalin would be akin to being one of the kids on \"The Cosby Show,\" with dad offering sage and humorous wisdom at the breakfast table and then excusing himself by saying, \"Gosh, look at the time. Gotta go. These atrocities won't commit themselves.\"\n\nThings between father and daughter started to go south when, at 16, Svetlana fell in love with a 40-year-old Jewish filmmaker. Her father didn't like the idea of it. There was the age difference and Stalin wasn't exactly a friend of members of the tribe. He ended the relationship by ordering the man arrested and sentenced to 10 years in Siberian labor camps.\n\nWhen she was 17, Svetlana met a fellow student at Moscow University and they wed. Her father disapproved and refused to even meet the man. They had a child, but the marriage didn't last, dissolving in 1947. She married twice more, each marriage failing but not before one of them produced another child. Then, she hooked up with an Indian Communist politician and they moved in together. Her father, again, disapproved of her romantic choice – he wasn't crazy about foreigners – and they were never permitted to marry.\n\nMore: Don Gentzler and his general store were the heartbeat of Stoverstown\n\nMore: British war bride found a good life in York – Pa., not England\n\nMore: Viva Yoe Vegas! A mini-casino could have put this small York County town on the map\n\nBy March 1967, she had had enough. She went to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and presented a letter with her intention to defect from the Soviet Union and seek asylum in the United States.\n\nThat began her journey to the United States, and East Berlin.\n\nWhen she landed in New York in April 1967, she was greeted by George Kennan, the former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Kennan was a complicated man. He was considered a brilliant thinker, one of the architects of the Cold War, but he longed for a time when pioneers made a living off the land, which was what led him to buy a farm outside of East Berlin. As one biographer wrote, \"He pined for an older, pristine America, one that wasn't enraptured by automobiles, suburbs, commercialism, and choked by pollution and greed.\"\n\nThe farm is secluded, hidden from the main road and far from any neighbors. It was his sanctuary. But he was far from a recluse. One old farmer said he was known around town and was even a member of the East Berlin volunteer fire company.\n\nAnd East Berlin is where he squired Stalin's daughter after she landed in America to hide her from the press, according to Kennan's biography.\n\nIt's not clear how long Svetlana – who, by now, had adopted her mother's maiden name, leaving her father's surname on scrapheap of her personal history – lived in East Berlin. It was common knowledge around town that Stalin's daughter had lived nearby, but few talked about it and fewer still mentioned it to outsiders. It was a safe place for Svetlana to hide out. Nobody outside of East Berlin knew where she was.\n\nA couple of years ago, Don Harlacker's cousin, then 94, mentioned that Stalin's daughter once lived down the road from his family's farm. He didn't know exactly where Kennan's farm was, but he remembered hearing that the former ambassador had hidden Stalin's daughter there some years back.\n\nHarlacker, a kind of history buff, was fascinated by the story. He went to the library in East Berlin and asked about it. All he got were a lot of stupefied looks. Nobody knew anything about it. He visited a few farms in the area, asking about the Kennan place and Stalin's daughter. Nobody could help him. Or they weren't helping him. Nobody wanted to have anything to do with Stalin, he reasoned.\n\nHe started searching for the farm. Whenever he had some free time and was in the area – he's retired from York International – he would drive around the East Berlin area, looking for the farm.\n\nOn one of his excursions, he drove down a long farm lane cut through a corn field, the corn practically hugging his car. He saw a number of typical farmhouses. The lane went on for a mile or so before he rounded a bend and saw a large mansion with pillars on the front porch. It wasn't a farm house. It looked like the kind of house that would have been owned by someone of Kennan's caliber. He snapped a photo of the house.\n\nLater, he confirmed it with his cousin, who had been to the house. It was Kennan's house and Svetlana Stalin had once lived there.\n\nSvetlana hadn't lived there long. Her life in America was difficult. She had left two children behind in the Soviet Union and was described as never really being happy in America. She published a couple of books, one earning her a reported $2.5 million. She lost all of the money when she fell in with a cult-like community built around the legacy of the late Frank Lloyd Wright by Wright's widow. She died, penniless, in a nursing home in Wisconsin in November 2011.\n\nHarlacker is amazed that his neighborhood played a small role in her history.\n\n\"It's a big world out there,\" he said. \"Here we had a world figure who spent time in our neighborhood, it gives you a strange feeling that history could wind up in your backyard, or at least pass through.\"\n\nReach Mike Argento at 717-771-2046 or at mike@ydr.com."
