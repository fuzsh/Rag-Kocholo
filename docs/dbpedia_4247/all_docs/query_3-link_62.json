When he was 11, his mother Nadezhda committed suicide.\n\t\n\tLike most children of the Soviet elite members of society, Vasily became a pilot. His plane was shot down five times, and he was known as a bold and brave pilot of the Soviet Army. His father was so hard on him that he was only after 12th request granted the rank of general.\n\t\n\tVasily loved to pilot his plane drunk so he could show the courage to the girls, and his father banned him from flying once.\n\t\n\tIn Leningrad, he was the first one to who started the construction of sports facilities and one could say that the credit goes him for football and hockey presence in Russian sport at the time.\n\t\n\tAfter his father’s death, he had a manic desire for revenge because he had claimed that his father was poisoned. What marked his military and personal life is wickedness to alcohol, according to media.\n\t\n\tAlso, he was considered a great womanizer, and this was supported by the fact he married four times. He was known for organizing “parties” where orgies were usual fun, and all of this terrified his father. He was arrested for “Soviet negative publicity” and admitted at the trial even the most basic charges. At his own request, he was set as auto-mechanic in prison.\n\t\n\tAfter serving a prison sentence of eight years, he was banned from staying in Moscow and his surname Stalin was taken.

Although considered as a dictator, Stalin was in her childhood a loving father and called her “Birdie.” He lavished her with gifts and brought her the American films.\n\t\n\tHer teenage days were marked with The Second World War and estrangement from her father.
