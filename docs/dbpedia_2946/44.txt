One more Death at a Funeral is taking place.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is set to drop the remake of the 2007 British comedy on both DVD and Blu-ray on August 10, 2010. That's got to be one of the fastest turn-arounds in cinema history from original to remake. This 2010 remake stars Chris Rock, Keith David (Mass Effect), Danny Glover, and the always-tremendous Peter Dinklage actually plays the same role that he had in the original film, as a mysterious stranger known only to the deceased. Talk about sticking to your guns.

The film had a love-it or hate-it nature about it, with Roger Ebert saying it surpassed the original, while IMDb users give it a 4.7. Decide for yourself, perhaps. Expect some bonus materials, with the DVD will be available for the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of $28.95, while the Blu-ray will run at the MSRP of $34.95.

The Death at a Funeral releases will feature the following bonus materials:

-- Commentary with director Neil LaBute and Chris Rock

-- Deleted Scenes

-- Death for Real featurette

-- Family Album

-- Death at a Funeral: Last Rites, Dark Secrets

-- movieIQ (Blu-ray only)

Box art for the DVD is unavailable, but the Blu-ray box is below:
