        "text": "Keith David is everywhere and has been for a long time. You've seen Keith David movies, watched Keith David TV shows, and played Keith David video games. Even so, you probably haven't entirely noticed his long-term ubiquity. It's a tribute to how talented he is - and how well-respected he is within the entertainment industry - that everyone wants to work with him.\n\nThe actor started off in John Carpenter's The Thing and has gone on to appear in blockbuster hits like There's Something About Mary and critically acclaimed fare like Spike Lee's Clockers. On the small screen, he joined the cast of Community for its sixth and final season. He's done voice work for animated features (Disney's The Princess and the Frog) and TV shows (Rick and Morty), and has become an in-demand voice actor in video games; you can hear him in Saint's Row, Halo 5, and Mortal Kombat 11. There is virtually no genre he hasn't conquered. David has done comedy, drama, action, sci-fi, horror, and even a Western.\n\nThis list looks at some of the most notable Keith David voice acting and on-screen performances to show just how diverse and astonishing his career has been. He's been appearing in movies, shows, and games you love for longer than you realize - and hopefully will continue to do so for a long time."
