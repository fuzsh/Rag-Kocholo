        "text": "A family gathers for the funeral of their father; but sibling rivalries and long-hidden secrets turn it from a solemn remembrance into a madcap free-for-all in \"Death at a Funeral,\" the American remake of a 2007 British farce.\n\n\"Brian, who is this?\"\n\n\"You know I asked myself the same thing when my dad passed. I said 'who is this man?'\"\n\n\"No, who is in this coffin because that is not my father.\"\n\nThe day of funeral does not start well for Aaron, played by Chris Rock. As the oldest son, he is determined that the memorial for his father be appropriate and respectful as the far-flung family gathers in his parlor. There's his mom, the grieving widow only consoled by her favorite son Ryan, Aaron's younger (and more successful) brother.\n\nThere's a motley assortment of cousins and, of course, the cantankerous old uncle. But the funeral guests also include a stranger whose relationship with the family - notably the deceased - will shake everyone up.\n\nPeter Dinklage is the mystery guest, repeating the role he played in the 2007 original version of \"Death at A Funeral\" that was set amid a stodgy, upper-crust English family. For the 2010 version, producer and star Chris Rock moves the action to the Los Angeles home of an upper middle-class black American family, but follows pretty much the same story.\n\n\"When you know a movie's ending works your life is so much easier,\" he said. \"I've remade a few movies and they all have one thing in common: great endings.\"\n\n\"You know you're climbing the same mountain, but you want to find a new way to do it as well,\" said Neil LaBute, a filmmaker known for dark edgy dramas. LaBute is director of the remake and insists he has only respect for the original and its director, Frank Oz.\n\n\"You want it to be your own and yet, especially in this case, I think everyone who had seen it really loved it,\" he said. \"There was no sense of 'oh, we can make this better.' It's just that we're going to make it our own.\n\n\"Do you remember the guy that came by a little earlier that we didn't recognize?\"\n\n\"The dude in the leather jacket?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, he showed me some pictures of him and dad.\"\n\n\"So he showed you some pictures. What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"Pictures of him and dad â€¦together.\"\n\n\"Oh, daddy!\"\n\nMartin Lawrence plays the self-centered younger brother.\n\n\"My man, Chris Rock, gave me a call personally,\" Lawrence said. \"When he first called I said 'sorry Chris I can't do that.' Then he sent me the British version and I thought it was very funny; and when he told me it was about playing his brother I said I have to be on board.\"\n\nTracy Morgan is a well-meaning, if inept, cousin in the large ensemble cast that, Morgan says, makes the comedy easier."
