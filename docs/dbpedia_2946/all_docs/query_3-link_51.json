        "text": "QPTV recorded this breathtaking performance for Queens residents!\n\nQPAC’s Executive and Artistic Director Susan Agin kicked off the exhilarating presentation at St. John’s University Little Theatre. She called Council Member I. Daneek Miller on stage to thank him for his support of $13.5 million dollars for QPAC’s new renovation of their facility. Susan said “I can’t wait for the completion, in the meantime home is where the heart is and QPAC’s performances will go on.” Daneek gracefully greets his constituents and is thrilled to be in the audience to see the live “Let There Be Love” performance.\n\nMany celebrities came out for the riveting performance; Chapman Roberts, Broadway Choral Director/Arranger “If you close your eyes you would think it was Nat.” The ladies from Sweet Honey and the Rock- Carol Maillard “There’s nothing like telling a story in your own way” and Louise Robinson “He put his spirit in it.” Jazz vocalist Rome Neal, “I went to school with my brother and he just gave me some wonderful lessons to do a Cabaret act.” The Gibbs family from East Elmhurst said “ I came out to see my friend perform, he did a fantastic job and I was happy to be here.” Keith David’s Let There Be Love show was sold-out, and the next best thing is to enjoy this QPAC performance on Queens Public Television’s channels or website.\n\nKeith David is a Proud Member of the “Black Stars of the Great White Way” A Norm Lewis/Chapman Roberts Concept\n\nKeith David, Actor/Singer | Frank Owens, Pianist | Wilbur Bascomb Jr., Bass | Eli Fontain Jr., Percussion\n\nSusan Agin, Executive and Artistic Director | Roslyn Nieves, TV Host, QPTV | Council Member I. Daneek Miller\n\nKeith David is a classically trained actor, winning 3 Emmys out of 6 nominations as well as being nominated for a Tony award. He currently stars in “Greenleaf” for Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network. He co-stars with Chadwick Boseman in “21 Bridges” and will be in “Horizon Line” with Allison Williams of “Get Out.”\n\nIn “Greenleaf,” Keith portrays ‘Bishop James Greenleaf’, the charismatic and God-fearing leader of the Calvary Fellowship and the patriarch of the family. The series follows the unscrupulous world of the Greenleaf family, their scandalous secrets and lies, and their sprawling Memphis megachurch.\n\nThe series has been praised for its push and pull dynamic, its hypocrisy, and its compelling characters. Keith’s stellar performance is best stated by The Hollywood Reporter, “... Keith David ...is perfectly cast as Bishop Greenleaf. Whether he’s playing to the congregation at the altar or getting conspiratorial in a smaller venue, this is an unusually great and meaty role for David.”\n\nOn the big screen, Keith recently appeared in the hit comedy feature film “Night School” with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish. He also starred in “Tales from the Hood 2”, the sequel to the ground-breaking original horror film by Spike Lee. His film credits include the Academy award-winning films “Crash” and “Platoon.” He is widely recognized for appearing in the highly-acclaimed films Disney’s “The Princess and the Frog”, “Requiem for a Dream”, “Men at Work”, “They Live”, “There’s Something About Mary”, and “The Thing.”\n\nOther notable TV credits include “Future Man”, “Community”, “ER”, “Enlisted”, and “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood”. On Broadway, Keith starred in August Wilson’s “Seven Guitars” and “Jelly’s Last Jam” for which he garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Musical.\n\nKeith’s work as a voice actor has made him a household name. His rich and powerful voice has been featured in national commercials, award shows, documentaries, video games, and animation. His work in narration has earned him 3 Emmys for Ken Burns’ “Jackie Robinson”, “The War”, and “Unforgivable Blackness – The Jack Johnson Story”. Some of his other voice acting credits include countless fan favorites such as “Adventure\n\nTime”, “Bojack Horseman,” “Rick & Morty”, “Spawn”, and “Gargoyles”. Keith has lent his voice to many video game titles. Keith’s voice will be heard portraying the character “Spawn” in the upcoming reboot of the “Mortal Kombat” videogame. Other appearances include the “Halo” series (games 2,3, and 5), the “Saint’s Row” series (games 1, 2, and 4), as well as the “Mass Effect” series (games 1,2, and 3). Born and raised in New York by his parents Lester and Dolores, Keith became interested in the arts at a very young age. After appearing in his school’s production of “The Wizard of Oz”, he knew this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. He enrolled in New York’s High School of the Performing Arts and continued his studies at The Juilliard School. After graduation, he was immediately hired by Joseph Papp as an understudy for the role of Tullus Aufidius in William Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus.” His work with Mr. Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival launched his incredible career.\n\nIn addition to his versatile acting and voiceover work, Keith is also a remarkable singer. He’s has been touring in 2 shows, “Let There be Love” a tribute to the legendary singer Nat King Cole, and a tribute to Joe Williams, “Here’s to Life.” Susan Agin, Executive and Artistic Director, for QPAC brings high level world-class entertainment to Queens, New York.\n\nQUEENSBOROUGH PERFORMING ARTS CENTER OVER 50-YEAR HISTORY"
