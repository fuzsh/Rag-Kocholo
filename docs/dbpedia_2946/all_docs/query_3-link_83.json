He is the narrator of the History Channel series The Bible which premiered on March 3, 2013.\n\nDavid voiced the superhero gorilla Solovar in the two-part Gorilla City episode of The Flash.\n\nStage acting\n\nIn 1992, David received a Tony Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Musical for his performance in Jelly's Last Jam.
