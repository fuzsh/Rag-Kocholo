In 2016, Keith David co-starred in the summer blockbuster, The Nice Guys, alongside Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, while simultaneously garnering accolades industry-wide for his portrayal of the title role of Bishop James Greenleaf on the Oprah Winfrey Networkâs hit drama, Greenleaf.

Noted for his deep, commanding voice, Keith is also an Emmy-winning voice over artist. He received his fourth Emmy nomination for Outstanding Narrator in Jackie Robinson, an acclaimed documentary by Ken Burns. Keithâs strong working relationship with Ken Burns made him the narrative voice for four of Kenâs epic documentaries. The segment, A Necessary War, from Burnsâ miniseries The War, earned David an Emmy Award to add to his first, previously won for Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.

As a native New Yorker, Mr. David has extensive stage experience and has studied voice and theater at the prestigious Juilliard School of Drama.
