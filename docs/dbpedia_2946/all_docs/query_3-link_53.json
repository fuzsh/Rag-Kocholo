        "text": "Keith recently completed season five starring in OWN’s dramatic series “Greenleaf” as ‘Bishop James Greenleaf’, the charismatic and God-fearing leader of the Calvary Fellowship and the patriarch of the family. The series follows the unscrupulous world of the Greenleaf family,\n\ntheir scandalous secrets and lies, and their sprawling Memphis megachurch. Over the past three years, the series has been praised for its push and pull dynamic, its hypocrisy, and\n\nits compelling characters. Keith’s stellar performance is best stated by The Hollywood Reporter, “… Keith David …is perfectly cast as Bishop Greenleaf. Whether he’s playing to the congregation at the altar or getting conspiratorial in a smaller venue, this is an unusually great and meaty role for David.” On the big screen, Keith recently appeared in the hit comedy feature film “Night School” with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in which he plays the role of Kevin Hart’s father. Keith also recently starred in “Tales from the Hood 2”, the sequel to the ground- breaking original horror film by Spike Lee. Coming up, Keith co-stars in “21 Bridges” with Chadwick Boseman, being released in theaters in the fall.. Keith was just in Ireland working on the feature film “Horizon Line” with Allison Williams who was the female lead in “Get Out”.\n\nKeith’s work as a voice actor has made him a household name. His rich and powerful voice has been featured in national commercials, award shows, documentaries, video games, and animation. His work in narration has earned him three Emmys for Ken Burns’ “Jackie Robinson”, “The War”, and “Unforgivable Blackness – The Jack Johnson Story”. Some of his other voice acting credits include countless fan favorites such as “Adventure Time”, “Bojack Horseman”, “Rick & Morty”, “Spawn”, and “Gargoyles”. Keith has lent his voice to many video game titles including the “Halo” series (games 2,3, and 5), the “Saint’s Row” series (games 1, 2, and 4), as well as the “Mass Effect” series (games 1,2, and 3).\n\nBorn and raised in New York by his parents Lester and Dolores, Keith became interested in the arts at a very young age. After appearing in his school’s production of “The Wizard of Oz”, he knew this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. He enrolled in New York’s High School of the Performing Arts and continued his studies at The Juilliard School. After graduation, he was immediately hired by Joseph Papp as an understudy for the role of Tullus Aufidius in William Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus.” His work with Mr. Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival launched his incredible career."
