        "text": "Redemption\n\nDetective Stabler (Christopher Meloni) finds himself paired with a brusque and opinionated cop, John \"Hawk\" Hawkins (guest star David Keith), who has become embittered with his job and personal life. The two work to capture a serial rapist/murderer whom Hawk originally nabbed years ago, but the more they learn about the new crimes he's suspected of, the more apparent it becomes that the recently released convict is not the culprit -- leading Hawk to realize that he may have convicted the wrong man.\n\nKame'e\n\nAt his mentor's request, McGarrett persuades Max to redo the autopsy on a SEAL, thought to have committed suicide, in order to investigate his murder. Meanwhile, Chin Ho worries about Kono hanging out with a group of dirty ex-cops.\n\nKi'ilua\n\nJenna Kaye seeks McGarrett's help in delivering a ransom to North Korea to rescue her fiancÃ©. While investigating the death of a reporter, Five-0 comes across a link to Jenna."
