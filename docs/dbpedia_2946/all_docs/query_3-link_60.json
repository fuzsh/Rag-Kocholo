        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Augustus Prew (Players) has joined the cast of the Paramount+ original drama series 1923 for Season 2. In a recurring role, Prew will portray ‘Paul’, a dapper, bookish, well-to-do young British man on a passenger ship.\n\n1923 follows a new generation of Duttons led by patriarch Jacob (Harrison Ford) and matriarch Cara (Helen Mirren). The series explores the early 20th century, when pandemics, historic drought and the end of Prohibition plague the Mountain West and the Duttons who call it home.\n\nSeason 1 also stars Brandon Sklenar, Aminah Nieves, Darren Mann, Julia Schlaepfer, Brian Geraghty, Sebastian Roche, Jennifer Ehle, Marley Shelton, Jerome Flynn, Michelle Randolph and Robert Patrick.\n\nAs Deadline revealed last month, Dexter alum Jennifer Carpenter was cast in Season 2 of the Taylor Sheridan series. She will recur as ‘Mamie Fossett,’ a highly capable U.S. Deputy Marshall who serves warrants and makes arrests with confidence ahead of her time. Janet Montgomery will also recur in the role of Hillary, a thoughtful woman who does not want to see injustice go unpunished.\n\nThe series is executive produced by Yellowstone co-creator Taylor Sheridan, David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Ben Richardson, Michael Friedman and Keith Cox. MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions produce exclusively for Paramount+. Season 1 is available to screen in its entirety via the streamer.\n\nThe Western drama is one of multiple series from Sheridan’s P+ slate which also includes Tulsa King and Lioness, both currently in production, Mayor Of Kingstown, Lawmen: Bass Reeves, 1883 and the upcoming Landman.\n\nPrew is an English actor who most recently starred in Netflix’s Players alongside Gina Rodriguez and played the male lead alongside Helena Bonham Carter in ITVX & PBS’s three-part series Nolly. Before that, he appeared in Amazon’s Lord of the Rings series, Netflix’s Special and Apple’s The Morning Show.\n\nHis TV credits also include leading roles in CBS’s Pure Genius and the ABC pilot The Hurt Unit with Melissa George. He is also recognized for his roles in Fox’s Prison Break, Mike White’s HBO pilot Mamma Dallas, and Showtime’s The Borgias. Prew is represented by CAA, Authentic Talent & Literary Management and Curtis Brown Group."
