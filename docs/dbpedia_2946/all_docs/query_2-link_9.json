        "text": "Hollywood is in mourning after Friends star Matthew Perry suddenly passed away on Saturday (Oct. 28), just a year after releasing his tell-all memoir that detailed his his lifelong struggles with addiction.\n\nThough his cause of death has not yet been announced, the actor was found dead in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home. Per the Los Angeles Times, a number of the actor’s neighbors who were present at the scene said his passing was “very disturbing” and “shocking.”\n\nPerry’s mother was also present at the scene, the outlet reports, along with a surprising appearance from broadcaster and Dateline correspondent Keith Morrison. But for those who knew Perry well, Morrison’s presence is not so surprising.\n\nWhy was Dateline‘s Keith Morrison at the scene of Matthew Perry’s death?\n\nMorrison has been Perry’s stepfather since he married the actor’s mother, Suzanne Marie Langford, in 1981. He’s reportedly known Perry since he was just 10 years old.\n\nMorrison even stood by Perry’s side when he was hospitalized in 2018 after his colon burst after years of opioid use. “We were able to be with him a lot of the time through that, which was I think good for everybody,” Morrison told People in 2020.\n\nHe later said he’s always known Perry to have a “remarkable” presence wherever he went, even as a child growing up. “He’s one of those people who always is the center of the room for a reason and it was so as a kid,” Morrison said. “He’s an intense, talented, focused character. He’s very bright. That was always the case as he was growing up.”\n\nThough he was at the scene after Perry’s passing, the broadcaster declined to comment on his death, the L.A. Times reports. Instead, the family released a statement mourning the actor.\n\n“We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother,” the family said, per People. “Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend.”\n\nSince news of his passing broke, the actor has been praised by many stars on X who worked with him throughout his career. Many praised him for finally opening up about his decades-long struggle with addiction, which he used to urge to others to seek help.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also paid tribute to the actor, who he’s known since they were children when Perry’s mother once worked as the press secretary for Trudeau’s father, former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\n\n“Matthew Perry’s passing is shocking and saddening,” Trudeau wrote on X. “I’ll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them. Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved — and you will be missed.”\n\nActress Paget Brewster perfectly encapsulated the “legacy” Perry wanted to leave behind in his wake in her tribute to the late star. The actress worked with him during a brief stint on Friends when she played his love interest."
