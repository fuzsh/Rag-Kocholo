'Indonesian National Military-Land Force') is the land branch of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. It has an estimated strength of 300,400 active personnel.[1] The history of the Indonesian Army has its roots in 1945 when the Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (TKR) \"People's Security Army\" first emerged as a paramilitary and police corps.[2]\n\nSince the nation's independence movement, the Indonesian Army has been involved in multifaceted operations ranging from the incorporation of Western New Guinea, the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, to the annexation of East Timor, as well as internal counter-insurgency operations in Aceh, Maluku, and Papua. The army's operations have not been without controversy; it has been periodically associated with human rights violations, particularly in West Papua, East Timor and Aceh.[3][4]\n\nThe Indonesia Army is composed of a headquarters, 15 military regional command (Kodam), a strategic reserve command (Kostrad), a special forces command (Kopassus), and various adjunct units. It is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Army (Kepala Staf Angkatan Darat – KSAD or KASAD).\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nIn the week following the Japanese surrender of 1945, the Giyūgun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese. Most PETA and Heiho members did not yet know about the declaration of independence. Command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled. Thus, rather than being formed from a trained, armed, and organised army, the Republican armed forces began to grow in September from usually younger, less trained groups under the national People's Security Agency built around charismatic leaders in the regions.[5] Creating a rational military structure that was obedient to central authority from such disorganisation, was one of the major problems of the revolution, a problem that remains through to contemporary times.[6] In a meeting between former KNIL and former PETA Division Commanders, organised by chief of staff (KSO) of People's Security Agency, Oerip Soemohardjo, a thirty-year-old former school teacher and PETA member, Sudirman, was elected 'commander-in-chief' in Yogyakarta on 12 November 1945.[7][8]\n\nAware of the limitations of the military in the face of the Dutch aggression, the people and government of Indonesia had no choice but to fight foreign threats to the young nation's independence. Thus, in 1947, the People's War Doctrine in which all the power of the national armed forces and the community and resources were deployed to confront the Dutch aggression, was officially implemented within the army and the wider armed forces as the national military strategy. Thus, the integrity and existence of the Unitary Republic of Indonesia has been able to be maintained by military force with the people. By 1947, the young Army (then named Tentara Republik Indonesia - Angkatan Darat) was organized into 10 infantry divisions, 7 Javanese and 3 Sumatran.\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the Round Table Conference (RTC), at the end of 1949 the United States of Indonesia (RIS) came into being. Correspondingly, the TNI's ground forces thus formed part of the Angkatan Perang Republik Indonesia Serikat (APRIS) (later the Angkatan Perang Republik Indonesia or APRI when the republic became unitary in 1950). It would be the merger of the TNI and the former KNIL and all military personnel of the two forces, plus the independent paramilitary groups (laskar) which fought the war on the side of the independence movement.\n\nAction against rebellions\n\nThe period is also called the period of liberal democracy is characterized by various rebellions in the country. In 1950 most of the former members of the Colonial Army launched an uprising in Bandung which is known as the Legion of the Just Ruler / APRA uprising and was led by former KNIL officer Raymond Westerling. The army also needed to confront the uprising in Makassar led by Andi Azis and the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) in Maluku. Meanwhile, DaruI Islam in West Java widened its influence to South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi and Aceh. In 1958 the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia / People's Struggle (PRRI / Permesta) started a rebellion in large parts of Sumatra and North Sulawesi endangering the national integrity. As part of the National Armed Forces the Army helped defeat all these uprisings, increasing its prestige in the eyes of the government and the people. Future Chief of Staff of the Army Ahmad Yani was instrumental in one of these first victories against rebels in Central Java.\n\nOn 17 November 1952, General Nasution was suspended as army chief of staff following army indiscipline over command and support that threatens the government. From the 1950s, the military articulated the doctrines of dwifungsi and hankamrata, the military roles in the country's socio-political development as well as security; and a requirement that the resources of the people be at the call of the armed forces and police if the State warrants it. On 5 July 1959, Sukarno, with armed forces support and the advice of Nasution, issued a decree dissolving the Constituent Assembly and reintroducing the Constitution of 1945 with strong presidential powers. By 1963, he also assumed the additional role of Prime Minister, which completed the structure of 'Guided Democracy', and was named \"President for Life\", also with army assistance, the year after.\n\nAt the same time, the Indonesian government started sending their troops on UN peacekeeping missions. The first batch of soldiers were sent to Sinai, Egypt and were known as Garuda Contingent 1. Garuda Contingent I began its first deployment 8 January 1957 to Egypt. Garuda Contingent I consisted of the combined personnel of the 15th Infantry Regiment Territorial Command (TT) IV/Diponegoro, as well as one company of the 18th Infantry Regiment TC V/Brawijaya in Malang. This contingent was led by Lt. Col. of Infantry Hartoyo which was later replaced by Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry Suadi Suromihardjo, while his deputy was Major of Infantry Soediono Suryantoro. The contingent departed on 8 January 1957, on board the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft of the United States Air Force for Beirut, the Lebanese capital. From Beirut the contingent was divided by two, the majority heading to Abu Suweir and partly to Al Sandhira. Furthermore, the El Sandhira troops moved into Gaza, the border area of Egypt and Israel, while the command is in Rafah. This contingent returned to Indonesia on 29 September 1957. Garuda Contingent I had a total number of 559 army personnel of all ranks.\n\n1960 onwards\n\nThe army was heavily involved in the Indonesian killings of 1965–1966. The killings were an anti-communist purge following a failed coup of the 30 September Movement. The most widely accepted estimates are that more than 500,000 people were killed. The purge was a pivotal event in the transition to the \"New Order\"; the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was eliminated as a political force. The failed coup released pent-up communal hatreds which were fanned by the Indonesian Army, which quickly blamed the PKI. Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the coup attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, Jakarta, and spread to Central and East Java and, later, Bali. Thousands of local vigilantes and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Although killings occurred across Indonesia, the worst were in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern Sumatra. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another.\n\nSukarno's balancing act of \"Nasakom\" (nationalism, religion and communism) had been unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, had been effectively eliminated by the other two pillars—the army and political Islam; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president.\n\nThe killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history books and have received little introspection by Indonesians and comparatively little international attention. Satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence have challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \"New Order\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's thirty-year presidency. The CIA described the massacre as \"one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s.\"[9]\n\nLater army operations have not been without controversy however.[3] Involvement in UN Peacekeeping operations continued, but in 2010, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was strongly criticized after two soldiers from Indonesia were filmed fleeing a clash on the Israeli-Lebanon border in a taxi.[10]\n\nThe size of the Army has expanded over the years; in July 1976 the Army was estimated to consist of solely 180,000 personnel, one armoured cavalry brigade, part of Kostrad (one tank battalion, plus support units), 14 infantry brigades (90 infantry, 1 para, 9 artillery, 11 anti-aircraft, and 9 engineer battalions) of which three of the brigades were in Kostrad, two airborne brigades totalling six battalions, also part of Kostrad, one independent tank battalion, 7 independent armoured cavalry battalions, and four independent para-commando battalions.[11]\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe Indonesian Army is currently organized into 15 military regions which are spread throughout the Indonesian archipelago. They are placed under the jurisdiction of the army headquarters. Three are based in Sumatra, four are based in Java, two are based in Kalimantan, one based in Lesser Sunda Islands, two based in Sulawesi, one based in Maluku and two based in Papua. The Komando Cadangan Strategis Angkatan Darat (Kostrad, strategic reserve forces) and Komando Pasukan Khusus (Kopassus, the Army special force) are independent formations and directly subordinate to the chief of staff. The army headquarters is under coordination with the armed force Headquarters. The highest-ranking officer within the army is the Chief of Staff of the Army which has the rank of a four-star General and is responsible to the Commander of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe Indonesian Army and its relation to the Armed Forces General Headquarters and the other military branches are structured into the following in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Regulation No. 66/ 2019 on the Organization of the Indonesian National Armed Forces:[12]\n\nChief of Staff of the Army (Kepala Staf Angkatan Darat), in charge of:\n\nheading the management and operational readiness of the Army;\n\nassisting the Commander of the Armed Forces in creating policies regarding the Army's image, doctrine, and strategy, as well as in preparing land-based operations;\n\nassisting the Commander of the Armed Forces in utilizing various state defense components; and\n\nother land-based duties as ordered by the Commander of the Armed Forces.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff of the Army (Wakil Kepala Staf Angkatan Darat), serving as the chief staff coordinator of the Army Headquarters, assisting the Army Chief of Staff in heading the Army.\n\nInspectorate General of the Army (Inspektorat Jenderal TNI Angkatan Darat), tasked with general internal supervision of the Army, as well as the supervision over the Army's treasury and finance;\n\nExpert Staff to the Army Chief of Staff (Staf Ahli Kepala Staf Angkatan Darat), tasked with providing the Army Chief of Staff with academic and scientific analysis over national and international issues;\n\nArmy Planning and Budgeting Staff (Staf Perencanaan dan Anggaran TNI Angkatan Darat), tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army planning, budgeting, and bureaucratic reform;\n\nArmy Intelligence Staff (Staf Intelijen TNI Angkatan Darat), tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army intelligence;\n\nArmy Operations Staff (Staf Operasi TNI Angkatan Darat) tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army operations;\n\nArmy Training Staff (Staf Latihan TNI Angkatan Darat) tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army training;\n\nArmy Personnel Staff (Staf Personalia TNI Angkatan Darat) tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army personnel;\n\nArmy Logistics Staff (Staf Logistik TNI Angkatan Darat) tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army logistics; and\n\nArmy Territorial Staff (Staf Teritorial TNI Angkatan Darat) tasked with drafting strategic policies and general administration of Army territorial affairs.\n\nArmy Headquarters Detachment (Detasemen Markas Besar TNI Angkatan Darat), in charge of managing the internal affairs, personnel, logistics, and finance in support of the Army Headquarters.\n\nThe following agencies are called Badan Pelaksana Pusat, translated as Central Executive Agencies, and directly subordinated under the Army Headquarters.

It is a corps-level command which has around 40,000 troops, organized into three divisions.[13] It also supervises operational readiness among all commands and conducts defence and security operations at the strategic level in accordance with policies of the TNI commander. Green berets are worn by its personnel, and it is the main basic warfare combat unit of the Indonesian Army.\n\nWhile Kopassus is the elite-special forces of the Indonesian Army, Kostrad is still maintained as the first-line combat unit of the TNI below the Kopassus.[14] Despite its nomenclature as reserve units, it is also used as main combat force, deployed for certain circumstances and is also capable for semi-special ops because mainly airborne infantry units are part of this corps. Kostrad contains Infantry (including Airborne) units, Artillery, Cavalry, and other military combat units.

However, Kopassus is also known for its alleged human right abuses in East Timor and Papua. Personnel of the unit are distinguished by their red berets, similar to most paratrooper and special forces units in the world.\n\nArmy territorial commands\n\nFurther information: Military Regional Command\n\nThe territorial Military Regional Command or Military Area Command (Komando Daerah Militer) and its units below hierarchically serve as the main operational organization of the Indonesian Army. These military territories were established by General Sudirman (the then-Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces), following the model of the Nazi German Wehrkreis system. The system was later codified in Surat Perintah Siasat No.1, signed into doctrine in November 1948.\n\nThe hierarchy of Indonesian Army territorial command is as follows:\n\nKodam (Komando Daerah Militer) Military Regional Command or officially known as Military Area Command (Provincial or multiple province level) is commanded by a two-star Major General;\n\nKorem (Komando Resor Militer) Military Resort Command or officially known as Military Subarea Command (Covering a province or multiple cities and regencies) is further divided into 2 type, A and B, commanded by a one-star Brigadier General and Colonel respectively;\n\nKodim (Komando Distrik Militer) Military District Command (City or Regency level) is further divided, into 3 type, independent, A and B, commanded by a Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, and Major respectively; and\n\nKoramil (Komando Rayon Militer) Military Rayon Command or officially known as Military Subdistrict Command (Kecamatan or district level) is further divided into 2 type, A and B, commanded by a Major and Captain respectively.\n\nThere are currently fifteen Kodams established across Indonesia, with all but two commands numbered.\n\nKodam I/Bukit Barisan covers northern and central Sumatra, except Aceh\n\nKodam II/ Sriwijaya covers southern Sumatra\n\nKodam III/Siliwangi covers western Java, except Jakarta metro area\n\nKodam IV/Diponegoro covers central Java\n\nKodam V/Brawijaya covers East Java\n\nKodam VI/Mulawarman covers eastern Kalimantan and areas of National Capital City Nusantara\n\nKodam IX/Udayana covered the lesser Sunda islands\n\nKodam XII/Tanjungpura covered western and central Kalimantan\n\nKodam XIII/Merdeka covers northern and eastern Sulawesi\n\nKodam XIV/Hasanuddin covers southern and western Sulawesi\n\nKodam XV/Pattimura covers the Moluccas\n\nKodam XVII/Cenderawasih covers western Papua\n\nKodam VIII/Kasuari covered eastern Papua\n\nKodam Jaya Jayakarta covers Jakarta metro area\n\nKodam Iskandar Muda covers Aceh\n\nThe Army's structure underwent various reorganizations throughout its early years. From 1946 to 1952 the Army was organized into a number of set combined arms divisions, dominated by infantry brigades. These were further consolidated in 1951, and then dispersed in 1952. From 1952 to 1958–59, the Army was organized into seven Territorial Armies (Tentara & Teritorium) composed of regiments and independent formations in the battalion level and below. In August 1958, the Indonesian Army reconsolidated its territorial organization. There were then established sixteen regional commands, which retained earlier divisional titles; the Siliwangi Division, for example, became Kodam VI/Siliwangi.[16] The RCs, then as in today, were subdivided administratively into Areas (the former territorial regiments), Districts (the former regimental battalions) and District Sectors, and operationally composed of a number of specialty battalions and in some regional commands, an infantry brigade.\n\nA reorganisation in 1985 made significant changes in the army chain of command. The four multiservice Defence Region Commands (Kowilhans) and the National Strategy Command (Kostranas) were eliminated from the defence structure, re-establishing the Military Regional Command (Kodam) as the key organisation for strategic, tactical, and territorial operations for all services.[17] The chain of command flowed directly from the ABRI commander in chief via the Chief of Staff of the Army to the ten territorial commands' commanders, and then to subordinate army territorial commands.\n\nThe territorial commands incorporate provincial and district commands each with a number of infantry battalions, sometimes a cavalry battalion, artillery, or engineers, and there are an increasing number of infantry brigades being activated.[18] Some have Raider battalions attached either under divisional control, under brigades, or as territorial infantry.\n\nArmy Branches/Corps\n\nCombat Elements (Satuan Tempur)\n\nFurther information: Indonesian Army infantry battalions\n\nFurther information: Indonesian Army infantry brigades\n\nFurther information: Division (military) § Indonesia\n\nInfantry branch (INF) (Indonesian: Infanteri) - The Infantry Branch is the principal and major unit of the Indonesian army combat element. The Infantry element is the largest and main combat troops within the Indonesian army. Most members of Kostrad and Kopassus are composed of infantrymen, although it also consists of non-infantry units internally. In Indonesia, there are more than 100 Infantry Battalions spread throughout the country. Green berets are worn by Indonesian Army infantrymen. The Infantry Branch of the Indonesian Army are under the auspices of the Infantry Branch Center (Pusat Kesenjataan Infanteri) which is under the command of a lieutenant general. The Infantry branch of the Indonesian Army consists of huge numbers of units whereas the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2007 lists the Army with 2 brigades, (6 battalions), plus 60 other battalions in each Kodams and nine battalions in Kostrad.[19] The elite infantry battalions of the Indonesian Army are called \"Raider Battalions\" (raised in 2003) which are specially trained in Raid and Air assault operations (including counter-terrorism, Extraction, Guerrilla and Close combat operations).[20] By strength and capabilities, 1 battalion of Raider infantry is equal to 3 regular infantry battalions combined. There are currently about 39 raider battalions in the Indonesian Army Infantry branch, with the strength of 650 to 800 men per-battalion. It is larger compared to regular infantry battalions which only consists about 450 to 570 infantrymen. Even as the Army Chief of Staff is planning in the future to qualify all Infantry battalions (except mechanized) as \"Raider\"-ready,[20] there are now mechanized battalions which are \"Raider\"-qualified in addition to their mechanized role. Infantry battalions in the Indonesian Army originates from different combat organisations or corps, there are several infantry battalions part of Kostrad and some are part of the territorial military commands, the same case also falls to Raider Infantry battalions. Currently, there are now 3 Airborne infantry brigades in the Indonesian Army which are all Raider qualified (thus named Para-raider), and are all part of the Kostrad corps.

The displayed parallel is approximate and for illustration purposes only.\n\nNote: The red banding on the rank insignia denotes the personnel holding a command position which is agnostic of rank.\n\nOfficers\n\nRank group General / flag officers Senior officers Junior officers Officer cadet Indonesian Army[23]\n\nJenderal besar Jenderal Letnan jenderal Mayor jenderal Brigadir jenderal Kolonel Letnan kolonel Mayor Kapten Letnan satu Letnan dua\n\nEnlisted\n\nRank group Senior NCOs Junior NCOs Enlisted Indonesian Army[23]\n\nPembantu letnan satu Pembantu letnan dua Sersan mayor Sersan kepala Sersan satu Sersan dua Kopral kepala Kopral satu Kopral dua Prajurit kepala Prajurit satu Prajurit dua\n\nEquipment and weaponry\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nHanwha Defense Systems Tarantula\n\nCAESAR self-propelled howitzer\n\nArisgator\n\nPindad Harimau tank\n\nSee also\n\nIndonesia portal\n\nMinistry of Defense (Indonesia)\n\nIndonesian Military Academy\n\nIndonesian Navy\n\nIndonesian Marines\n\nIndonesian Air Force\n\nFifth Force\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFriend, Theodore (2003).
