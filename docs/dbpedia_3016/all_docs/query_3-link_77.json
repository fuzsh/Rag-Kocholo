        "text": "Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI)\n\nIndonesian Communist Party was one of the biggest and most important political parties in early Indonesia, and prior to its destruction in 1965, was the third largest communist party in the world.\n\nHenricus Sneevliet aka Maring, the Dutch founder of Indonesian communism (and Chinese communism as well). He was executed by the Nazis in 1942.\n\nPKI leadership in Batavia, 1925\n\nThe party was established in Surabaya by Dutch communist Henricus Sneevliet aka Maring in 1914 as Indies Social Democratic Association (Dutch: Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging ; ISDV). Maring would later go on to found the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. ISDV originally consisted of 85 members, all whites, members of Dutch socialist parties SDAP (Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiders Partij) and SDP (Sociaal-Democratische Partij) residing in Indonesia.\n\nOn October 1915, ISDV started its first publication in Dutch, Het Vrije Woord, edited by Adolf Baars. At this point ISDV was white-majority party, with 100 members, of which only three were Indonesians.\n\nIn 1917, ISDV tried to provoke a rebellion among Dutch soldiers and sailors in Surabaya. Some soldiers formed the Surabaya Soviet, copying the Bolshevik revolt in Russia that year. Dutch colonial authorities quickly suppressed the efforts, deporting the Dutch leaders of the revolt (including Maring) from Indonesia.\n\nThe Surabaya soviet revolt depleted ISDV of its white membership, moving the party into a majority Indonesian party. In 1919, there were only 25 whites out of a total of 400 members.\n\nIn 1920 ISDV changed its name to Partai Komunis di Hindia (PKH). PKH was the oldest communist party in Asia, represented in the 1920 Communist International Congress in Moscow by Maring. PKH's first chairman was a Javanese tramworker, Semaun.\n\nIn 1924, PKH again changed its name to Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI). PKI membership grew rapidly thanks to Semaun's strategy of infiltrating the Muslim organisation Sarekat Islam, eventually causing half of its membership to break-off, forming the Red Sarekat Islam, which eventually merged with PKI.\n\nIn 1926, PKI launched full-scale rebellion in Banten and West Sumatera, declaring Soviet Republic of Indonesia. The rebellion was quickly crushed by the Dutch authorities, who arrested 13,000 people in the aftermath. 1308 persons, including the whole PKI leadership, were exiled to the malaria-infested Boven Digoel concentration camp in West New Guinea.\n\nBetween 1926-1945, Indonesian communists went underground, with most of its leadership in exile, with Musso, as chairman living in Moscow under protection of Stalin.\n\nIn 1945, after the proclamation of independence by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, PKI re-emerged to participate in the war of independence against Dutch recolonisation attempts. PKI controlled many armed groups, these groups often clashed with nationalist and Islamist armed groups, particularly over the decision by President Sukarno to use negotiations with the Dutch.\n\nIn 1948, PKI chairman Musso returned to Indonesia after twenty years' exile in Soviet Union. In response to the very disadventageous Renville Agreement signed by Sukarno government that year, PKI joined Pesindo and leftist-PSI in forming the People's Democratic Front (Front Demokrasi Rakyat; FDR). FDR seized control of East Javanese city of Madiun on September 1948, declaring a Soviet Republic of Indonesia with Musso as president and Amir Sjarifuddin as prime minister. In areas under their control, PKI murdered thousands of nationalists and Islamic clerics, their ideological enemies.\n\nHowever, no mass revolt in support of PKI occured, so the Indonesian army of the Siliwangi Division under General Gatot Subroto quickly crushed the communist revolt, killing thousands of PKI members and arresting 36,000. PKI leader Musso was shot dead, while Amir Sjarifuddin was captured and later executed.\n\nHowever, PKI was not banned, and the party re-established itself in 1950 under its young chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit, a Belitung Malay. Aidit changed PKI's strategy into a nationalist, anti-Western party in accordance to the policies of President Sukarno. This change of policy caused PKI membership to soar exponentially, from 5,000 members in 1950 to 165,000 members in 1954, and 1.5 million by 1959.\n\nIn 1955 elections, PKI won fourth place, winning 16% of the votes. The communist advance alarmed the Muslim party Masyumi, who collaborated with opportunist regional military chiefs, the CIA, MI-6, and even the radical Islamist DI-TII rebels in launching the PRRI-Permesta rebellion in 1958. This rebellion, however, was quickly crushed by the Indonesian army helped by PKI volunteers.\n\nIn 1959, President Sukarno disbanded parliamentary democracy and installed a personal dictatorship. In 1960, Sukarno declared his rule would be supported by three elements of Indonesian society: Nationalists, Communists, and Religionists (Nasionalis, Agamais, Komunis; NASAKOM), hence cementing PKI's place in Sukarno's dictatorship system.\n\nUnder NASAKOM, PKI supported the successful confrontation against the Dutch to take control of West Papua. PKI played a great deal in getting President Sukarno in declaring the confrontation against Malaysia, a policy suggested by China and Soviet Union to help the rebellion of the Malayan Communist Party. PKI volunteer armed units actively participated in the jungle fighting against British and Commonwealth forces in Sabah and Sarawak. Internationally, PKI pushed Sukarno to withdrew from the UN and aligned Indonesia with China.\n\nG30S/PKI\n\nDipa Nusantara Aidit, the brains behind G30S/PKI\n\nUnder NASAKOM, PKI rallies always includes photo of Sukarno alongside those of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao\n\nSukarno addressing a PKI rally\n\nWorries about Sukarno's declining health caused PKI to be concerned as to what their ideological rivals, the nationalists (represented by the army) and the religionists would do against them in a post-Sukarno Indonesia. Therefore, in 1964, PKI established the Biro Chusus (BC) to infiltrate and eventually gain control of Indonesian armed forces. By 1965, PKI has full control of the air force and has neutralised the navy and the police. Although PKI made strong inroads in infiltrating the army, the top leadership remained strongly anti-communist by manifesting the Tri Ubaya Cakti, a statement opposing Sukarno's alignment with China and his confrontation against Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, to neutralise this threat, PKI spread strong propaganda accusing the top army generals of being CIA agents plotting to overthrow Sukarno, while pressing for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of peasants and workers armed by China, which would virtually be PKI's own armed force.\n\nAidit ( l ) and Sudisman ( r ) presented a bird-of-paradise to their boss, Mao Zedong\n\nSukarno and Aidit\n\nSukarno and Mao Zedong. Mao thought of Sukarno as an unreliable ally and wanted to get rid of him.\n\nOn 30 September 1965, pro-communist army units based from Halim airforce base in East Jakarta, led by Lieut-Col Untung bin Sjamsuri, kidnapped and killed six generals and one lieutenant, the whole top leadership of the army. The key plotters are Untung (regimental commander of presidential guards), Sjam (head of PKI's BC), Pono (member of PKI's BC), Brig-Gen Supardjo (communist sympathiser in army), Lieut-Col Latief (battalion commander of Jakarta garrison), and AF Major Sujono (security chief of Halim AF Base).\n\nThe victims were Lieut-Gen Achmad Yani, Maj-Gen Suwondo Parman, Brig-Gen Mas Tirto Harjono, Brig-Gen Suprapto, Brig-Gen Sutojo Siswomihardjo, Brig-Gen Donald Izacus Pandjaitan, and Second Lieutenant Pierre Andreas Tendean.\n\nThe kidnappers failed to capture Gen Abdul Harris Nasution who escaped to a neighbour's house. However, his infant daughter Ade Irma Suryani was mortally wounded while a guard of his neighbour, Adjunct Police Inspector Karel Satsuit Tubun was killed while inspecting the disturbances.\n\nThe coup plotters seized the RRI radio station and telecommunication building, announced themselves as 30th of September Movement who had arrested several CIA-backed generals who were planning to overthrow Sukarno and proclaimed a Revolutionary Council government replacing Sukarno's cabinet. Furthermore, they declared that they have Sukarno under their protection. PKI newspaper Harian Rakjat immediately declared support for the massacre, calling the dead generals \"CIA agents\".\n\nThe involvement of PKI in this murder plot is undeniable as the top members of the PKI Politburo CC (Central Commitee): Aidit, Njoto, and Sudisman were all involved the the planning of the coup attempt including supply of communist youth members (Pemuda Rakjat) to help occupy the RRI station. Aidit himself was in Halim AF Base and was actively communicating with the coup plotters. Halim AF Base was chosen as the base for the coup plotters since the airforce chief, Marshall Omar Dhani, was completely under communist control.\n\nHowever, the coup were foiled by two persons: Sukarno and Suharto.\n\nSukarno had been informed of the kidnap plans by PKI chairman Aidit on August 1965. He had approved of the plan as he was convinced that these generals were truly plotting to overthrow him. However, during the night of the murders, Sukarno decided not to sleep in Merdeka Palace, where Untung's soldiers were supposed to pick him up later that night to \"secure\" him in Halim AF Base. He instead stayed at his third wife Haryati's house in Grogol, where the next morning he heard the radio announcement where he heard the planned formation of a new revolutionary government without including himself. Sensing that the plotters were actually trying to overthrew him, Sukarno gambled with his luck:\n\nFIRST, Sukarno ordered his adjudant Brig-Gen Sabur to make a press release that he, President of Indonesia, is healthy and still hold the rein of power.\n\nSECOND, Sukarno made a bold gamble by driving with a few dozen of his heavily-armed personal bodyguards to Halim AF Base, where he ordered the pro-communist army officer coordinating the whole 30th September operations, Brig-Gen Supardjo, to immediately cease all operations and withdrew all of their soldiers from the radio and telecommunication stations and return to Halim AF Base. Faced with a direct order by Sukarno, Brig-Gen Supardjo chickened out and complied, without consulting Aidit.\n\nHence, the PKI coup immediately collapsed as the \"pro-communist\" soldiers abandoned Aidit to comply with Sukarno's commands. Hearing of Sukarno's orders, Admiral RE Martadinata of the navy and Commisioner Sutjipto Judodihardjo of the police issued statements condemning the generals' murders. Aidit and Sjam at first tried to threaten Sukarno and the soldiers, but to no avail. Consequently, the PKI leadership decided to fly to the safety of relatively pro-communist area of Surakarta - Central Java, using an airforce plane given by Marshall Dhani.\n\nAfterwards, Sukarno tried to re-organize the now decapitated army leadership by instructing all remaining army chiefs to meet him at Halim. Inadvertantly, he gave away his location to the remaining army leaders. In reply, he received direct threat from Suharto to leave Halim since the army will attack the airbase to destroy the G30S kidnappers.\n\nShocked at this insubordination, the president then drove from Halim to the safety of Bogor Palace, while his children were flown to Bandung in a helicopter to gain protection of Sukarno-loyalist Siliwangi Division.\n\nPKI had failed to took into account an obscure general Suharto, commander of KOSTRAD (Startegic Reserve Commandos) whose forces are readily available in Jakarta. Suharto knew of the murder plot the day before from his pro-communist friend Colonel Latief, who believed Suharto, a known Sukarno-loyalist, would at least stay neutral. Suharto decided to sit out the murders that night, because he was not sure on whether this plot was backed by Sukarno or not.\n\nOn October 1, hearing of exclusion of the president from the rebels' radio statement, Suharto realised that Sukarno was not behind the coup plotters. He immediately mobilised his KOSTRAD soldiers, augmented by KODAM JAYA troops (commanded by Suharto's pal Gen Umar Wirahadikusumah) and RPKAD commandos (under Col Sarwo Edhie Wibowo) to retake the RRI radio station, declaring the murders and the coup as an attempted rebellion meant to overthrow President Sukarno. On October 2, having been tipped-off by Sukarno, Suharto led a joint KOSTRAD-KODAM JAYA-RPKAD assault on Halim AF Base, the base of the coup plotters. Disoriented and disorganised, the pro-communist soldiers, including Untung, put up little resistance and escaped for their lives.\n\nAfter arriving in Central Java, Aidit attempted to form a \"revolutionary government\" in cities of Semarang, Boyolali, Solo, and Yogyakarta, where pro-communist soldiers from Diponegoro Division had seized control. However, upon hearing that the rebellion in Jakarta had collapsed, these soldiers begin to abandon Aidit and disappeared from view. Not only that, PKI ranks begin to crack, with many members deciding to distance themselves from the coup attempt. Aidit was forced to abandon the cities and hide in the Solo countryside.\n\nTo replace the dead army commander (Gen Achmad Yani), President Sukarno appointed Gen Suharto. For the first week after the coup attempt, from the Bogor Palace, Sukarno attempted to be belittle the generals' murders as \"a ripple in the ocean\" (een rimpeltje in de oceaan) as to take away attention from the fact that he himself had approved the operation. He blamed the murders on \"misguided elements\" of the PKI, without blaming the PKI as a whole, as to maintain the NASAKOM base of his dictatorship.\n\nHowever, the army, having lost its top leadership to communist murderers, was not accepting this. They wanted to destroy the PKI to its roots. Cooperating with religious and student elements, the army launched massive anti-communist violence, tinged with anti-Chinese undertones, throughout the country, starting by the burning down of PKI headquarters in Jl Kramat Raya 81 on 8 October 1965 by Pemuda Ansor NU. Under the leadership of Gen Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, RPKAD troops swept Central and East Java, then Bali to \"wipe out the communists\". Thousands of youth heed the call of \".....\" by NU and Muhammadiyah, ensuing a bloodbath in which approximately 500,000 - 1 million real or suspected members of PKI were killed. One million people were arrested and jailed, many to distant penal colonies in remote islands.\n\nAidit was captured and killed by RPKAD soldiers under Maj Yasir Hadisubroto on 22 November 1965. PKI Politburo members such as Njoto, Njono, Sudisman, Sakirman, and Lukman were captured in 1967 and all were later executed.\n\nOf the coup plotters, Lieut-Col Untung was captured early in 1965 followed quickly by Maj Sujono. Sjam, Lieut-Col Latief, and Brig-Gen Supardjo managed to evade capture until 1967. All of them were sentenced to death and executed.\n\nIn 1968, remnants of PKI under its youth leader Surachman and Oloan Hutapea launched small-scale armed rebellion in Blitar, East Java. However, the army quickly crushed this rebellion in Operasi Trisula, killing both Surachman and Hutapea, while capturing many PKI leaders such as Pono (one of G30S plotters), Rewang, Tjugito, and Ruslan Widjajasastra.\n\nBetween 1967-1972, PKI armed units in West Borneo formerly engaged in Malaysian Confrontation along Sarawak border engaged in anti-military insurgency (PGRS-Paraku rebellion) which was supported by the relatively large ethnic-Chinese rural population in that province. By 1972, however, the army had crushed this rebellion, killing its leader, former Pontianak PKI chief Sjarif Achmad Sofyan bin Barabah.\n\nWith this event, Indonesian Communist Party died for the last time.\n\nPICS OF THE CRUSHING OF THE COMMUNISTS\n\nYouth armed to the teeth ready to kill communists at Mount Merapi area, November 1965\n\nPKI headquarters burned down by Muslim Ansor Youth, 8 October 1965\n\nThe military arresting suspected communists in Tangerang, 1965\n\nChinese Embassy in Jakarta was attacked and sacked by anti-communist mob in 1965.
