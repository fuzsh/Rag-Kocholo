        "text": "Our previous book Corruption in the Global Era (Pasculli and Ryder, 2019a) aimed at improving our understanding of the global causes, means, forms of perpetration and effects of corruption through an interdisciplinary dialogue between academics and practitioners, taking advantage also of the partnership between the Financial Crime Research Network (FCRN) at the University of the West of England and the Global Integrity Research Network (GIRN) at the Centre for Financial and Corporate Integrity (CFCI) of Coventry University. This volume complements those studies by focusing on global and local regulatory responses to corruption. It is not a handbook or a commentary, but a research book aimed at advancing the still limited assessment of the effectiveness of anti-corruption laws (cf. Isenring, Chapter 14) and enriching the scarce British literature on corruption and financial crime (cf. Ryder, 2018a: p. 247). Many of the authors are practitioners and the approach is still interdisciplinary: different fields of the law (criminal law, tax law, European law, corporate law, competition law), as well as issues in ethics, criminology, restorative justice, governance and political philosophy are covered. The perspective is international and comparative. The book explores not only international regulations but also their implementation in different countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Italy, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Nigeria. This chapter brings together the findings of this book and formulates recommendations for future policies and research. One of its purposes is precisely to coordinate such findings with those of our previous research. Therefore, remands to our own works are not self- congratulatory, but necessary to avoid reiterating arguments and references already expressed elsewhere. In the first section, we will outline the sources of the current global anti-corruption framework and their limits. In the second section, we will illustrate the shortcomings of negative anti-corruption measures, while in the third we will analyse positive measures. In the fourth section, we will articulate some recommendations. Finally, we will draw our conclusions.\n\nCorruption is perhaps the biggest political and economic challenge of the twenty-first century. It stands at the core of, or closely by to, endemic poverty, political instability, organized crime, international terrorism, civic disaffection, economic decline, and a number of other issues damaging the quality of government and the quality of life of billions of people around the globe. Long gone is the time when it could be swept away as an issue solely affecting poor and underdeveloped nations, or when it was proposed to be functional to certain types of bureaucracies affected by pervasive red tape. Now it is finally recognized for what it is—the cancer of society. Despite the evils its name now conjures, however, public efforts to curb corruption have largely missed the target, and more often than not they have ended up demonstrating a gross level of incompetence, or plain and sheer disinterest. Seemingly contradictorily, the crude political reality of the fight against corruption ...\n\nCorruption serves as a major impediment to development. Resources intended to address the basic development needs of millions of poor people around the world are diverted and misallocated through various forms of corrupt practices. donors are becoming increasingly aware of the relationship between corruption and development and taking measures to mitigate these effects. This concept paper emphasises that a shared consensus between partner countries, policy-makers and academics is critical. donors should situate themselves in a position from which they are able to provide the necessary analysis and support required by partner countries in their own anti-corruption efforts. The main objective of this paper is to provide insights into the current thinking on anti-corruption in developing countries in order to enable the EU staff (at the Commission, EEaS and in EU delegations) : • acquire useful tools to analyse corruption in a given local setting; • Become better equipped to support the implementation of anti-corruption strategies and policies; and • to better identify relevant anti-corruption measures so as to improve the mainstreaming of anti-corruption in European Commission development assistance.\n\nCorruption is now understood to be a common phenomenon among many countries and many organisations. Generally corruption means the abuse of public power for private gain, which can also be seen as a conflict between the obligation to exercise a public power in the public interest and the self-interest of an individual to use or exploit the power for private gain. Corruption is subversive of good governance, stable economic structures, stable legal systems and just and other structures because it replaces the normal rules which determine the outcomes of dealings between individuals, organisations, between organisations and the state and various commercial entities. In this essay it will be discussed tools and instruments for setting up an effective practical anticorruption policy for the UNDP organisation."
