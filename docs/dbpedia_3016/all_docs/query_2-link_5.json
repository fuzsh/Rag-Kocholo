        "text": "PapuaAround.com – The leadership lineup of the Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) now stands out with the presence of three senior generals, each distinguished by their achievements and experience. Kostrad, which serves as the core strength of the Indonesian Army, plays a crucial role in the nation’s defense strategy. Within this organization, rank, and field experience are the primary criteria for determining the roles and positions of its leaders. So, who are the three senior generals occupying key positions in Kostrad?\n\nFirst, Lieutenant General TNI Muhammad Saleh Mustafa, currently serving as the Commander of Kostrad since December 7, 2023. Known as an experienced figure, Mustafa is a graduate of the Military Academy class of 1991. Before assuming the role of Pangkostrad, he served as the Chief of Staff of Kostrad and held various strategic positions such as Pangdam XVII/Cenderawasih and Special Advisor to the Army Chief of Staff for Socio-Cultural Affairs, Human Rights, and Narcotics.\n\nNext, Brigadier General TNI Handoko Nurseta, who has been serving as the Deputy Inspector of Kostrad since April 19, 2022. With an educational background from the Military Academy class of 1990, Handoko Nurseta has made a mark in various key positions, including as the Chief of Staff of Korem 084/Bhaskara Jaya and Kapok Sahli of Pangdam XII/Tanjungpura. His presence contributes significantly to maintaining the quality and discipline within Kostrad.\n\nLastly, Major General TNI Ilyas Alamsyah Harahap, currently serving as the Chief of Staff of Kostrad since March 22, 2024. Ilyas, a graduate of Akmil 1988 B, has accumulated a wealth of experience in his military career. Before assuming his current position, he served as Pangdam XVIII/Kasuari and held positions such as Special Advisor to the Army Chief of Staff for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs and Deputy Commander of Pusterad.\n\nThese three senior generals play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and effectiveness of Kostrad, one of the main components of national defense. With diverse backgrounds and experiences, it is hoped that they will continue to fulfill their duties effectively and make positive contributions to the security and defense of Indonesia.\n\nRead also: Papua Mountain KPU Heads to Jakarta for National Summit\n\nSource: SindoNews."
