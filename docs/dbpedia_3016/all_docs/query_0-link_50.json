In this paper, the term \"Indonesian coup\" is used inter- changeably with \"The 30 September Movement,\" mainly for the sake of variety. It is technically correct to refer to the events in Indonesia as a \"coup\" in the literal sense of the word, meaning \"a sudden, forceful stroke in politics.\" To the extent that the word has been accepted in common usage to mean \"the sudden and forcible overthrow of the government,\" however, it may be misleading. For it now seems clear that the Indonesian coup was not a move to overthrow Sukarno and/or the established government of Indonesia. Essentially, it was a purge of the Army lead- ership, which was intended to bring about certain changes in the composition-of the cabinet. In this sense, it is more correct to refer to the 30 September Movement as a purge, rather than a coup. A word should also be said about the organization of the paper. It is divided into four main sections. The first one treats the actual events of the coup ondl October; the second one traces the movements of the key figures in the coup up to the time of their capture or, in the case of Sukarno, up to March 1966, when he lost de facto control of the government to Gen. Suharto, who assumed full responsibility for restoring law and order; the third one discusses the planning for the coup that vos done in the one month of September 1965; and the last one, perhaps the most important one, reviews the events leading up to the coup, including the decision to stage the coup. This organization was chosen for several reasons. First of all, there was the consideration of the evidence itself. For the most part, the matters that are discussed in the first two sections are matters of established fact; in other words, they are part of the record against which we must examine the words and testimony of the various Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 -individuals who were involved in the coup. Our knowledge of the conspiracy behind the events, which is the subject of the third section of the paper, comes entirely from �the interrogation of the people involved in the conspiracy. Naturally, this kind of evidence must be considered in a slightly different light than the evidence that is pre- sented in the first two sections. The reader is in a better position to make his own judgment, based on the evidence, if he has a clear understanding of the kind of evidence that is involved. The matters that are discussed in the fourth section are much more matters of judgment. The coup can only be understood, of course, against the background of Indonesian politics in 1965. Many of the events that form that back- ground are open to varying interpretation, however. Again, the reader is in a better position to evaluate those events if he can view them from the vantage point of hindsight, as it were, with the events of the coup clearly drawn in his mind. The one difficulty with the arrangement of the paper, with the events of the coup at the beginning, is the possibility of its creating the false impression that the coup was a distinct occurrence, which can be treated apart from the rest of the Indonesian political scene. 4 Of course, it can not. It should be viewed as the culmina- tion of many events over the.years. There has been a deliberate effort in telling the story of the coup to present the evidence in as straight- forward a manner as possible, to let the facts speak for themselves. The purpose of this has been to allow the reader to make his own conclusions as he goes along. A final section at the end of the paper summarizes the con- clusions of the author. All the events that are discussed in the paper, including the events of the coup itself and the major events leading up to the coup, are presented in chrono- logical order in the Chronology of Events. Also included in the Appendix is a brief-discussion of the validity of the Army interrogation reports as evidence.

The report summarized all informa- tion known about the activities of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) as of that date. In particular, it mentioned a report of a plan to assassinate the army's top leadership, giving a list of the Army generals who were to be killed. In conclusion, it stated the Army Intelligence judgment that \"something was going to happen.\" At first, General Parman had been reluctant to accept the judgment of his staff. He was more conserva- tive on the question; in the end, however, he agreed to take the case to General Yani. Yani, in turn, pretented the report to President Sukarno, laying particular stress on the \"assassination list,\" which included the names of three generals--Suharto, Mursjid, and Sukenulo--in addition to the seven generals who were later t be the target of the Indonesian coup of 30 September. The report mentioned September 18 as the date4of the planned attack, and, on that evening, the army took special security precautions; but nothing happened. After that, Yani apparently did not take the report seriously. and no special precautions were observed. Late in September the former military attache in Peking, Brig. Gen. Sudono, told Maj. Gen. M.T. Harjono, a subsequent victim of the coup, that he had learned that a number of Army generals would be abducted within a few days. Although General Harjono did not believe the in- formation, he decided to call a staff meeting at Army headquarters on 30 September since General Sudono was so obviously in earnest. Apparently, PKI intelligence learned about this meeting but drew the wrong conclusions as to the subject under such high-level discussion. At the meet- ing, General Sudono reportedly became \"the butt of laughter\" of everyone present. Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Yet, within a matter of hours of the staff meeting at Army headquarters, exactly what General Sudono said he had heard would happen \"within a few days\" happened that very night. That the Army was totally unprepared for an attack from its political enemies was the most obvious feature of the Indonesian coup. In one night alone, the army was to suffer the staggering loss of six of its most senior generals. Never before, in any of the great wars, have six generals been lost in a single night. 1. ..t Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The Coup At approximately 0400 hours on the morning of 1 October 1965 the leaders of the 30 September Movement launched their surprise attack on the Army leadership in the form of simultaneous raids on the homes of seven gen- erals. In a matter of hours, the military action in- volved in the coup was over; besides the raids, it in- volved only the securing of a few vital objectives--the Presidential Palace in Djakarta, the radio station of Radio Indonesia, the central telecommunications build- ing, and an airbase just outside Djakarta. These purely military aspects of the coup are by now fairly clear. Thus, in beginning with a reconstruction-of the military opera- tion of the coup itself, we can establish certain neces- sary facts about the coup before discussing what we do and do not know for sure about the planning of thek,coup. The Kidnapping of the Generals The staging ground for the attack was an abandoned rubber plantation that was within the confines of Lubang Buaja, a small village or hamlet on the outskirts of Halim Air Force Base, about seven miles from the Presidential Palace in Djakarta. Reached by another road than the main approach to the airbase, Lubang Buaja was a remote area that could easily be sealed off for purposes of security.* *In the tightly structured organization of local govern- ment in Indonesia, Lubang Buaja is properly referred to as a Kompung or \"hamlet,\" which is smaller than a \"village\" or \"town\" or \"city.\" It is the lowest level of local gov- ernment in Indonesia. Usually, a Kompung is set apart by a fence that encloses the whole area of the Kompung. In the case of Lubang Buaja, the only road into the Kom- pung runs parallel to the road into Halim Air Force Base from the main Bogor-Djakarta Highway. A security guard on this road can guarantee the security of the whole area. (See map of \"Djakarta and Vicinity.\") The literal meaning of the name \"Lubang Buaja\" is \"Crocodile's Hole,\" which suggests that the area was once a swamp land. -1- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Early on the morning of 1 October, at about 0400 hours while it was still dark, some 10-15 trucks and buses left Lubang Buaja and began a 30-minute drive into Djakarta. The assortment of vehicles--all of which be- longed to the Air Force--carried 4 fully-armed companies of troops: one company from the special Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard that guarded President Sukarno, one company from the 454th battalion of Central Java, one company from the 530th battalion of East Java, and one company of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Territorial Command. In view of the persistent belief that some civilians, namely Communist party members and sympathizers, particip- ated in the kidnapping raids on the generals' homes, it 1-iou1d be 'emphasized that only regular military officers and men wearing army uniforms, were actually involved. The troops were under the command of Marine Lt. Dul Arief, a direct subordinate of Col. Untung, one of the three battalion Commanders of the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard and the chosen leader for the coup. As it neared the residential area in which the top Army leaders lived, the caravan of trucks broke up into seven separate raiding parties destined for seven differ- ent targets, the homes of seven of the Army's senior gen- erals.* A force of one fully-armed platoon was assigned' to handle each of the following five generals: General Suprapto, General Harjono, General Parman, General Pand- jaitan, and General Sutojo. Special forces of one fully- armed company each were assigned to the homes of Minister/ Coordinator of Defense Nasution and Army Minister/Commander Yani, respectively. Contrary to widespread belief, the *All of the generals except Gen. Pandjaitan lived in an elite residential section of Djakarta called Menteng. Before the caravan of trucks reached this section of town, one or two of the trucks must have turned off in the direction of Kebajoran, where Gen. Pandjaitan lived. As they approached the Menteng area, the others broke up into six separate raiding parties destined for the homes of the six other Army generals. -2- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 coup leaders had not included General Suharto, a former commander of the Central Java Territorial Division (the Diponegoro Division) and the then chief of the army's strategic reserve force (KOSTRAD), with headquarters in Djakarta, in the list of generals to be eliminated as the top leadership of the army. The error of not seizing Suharto, known as a strong and capable officer but ob- viously underestimated and not foreseen to be the man who would quickly and effectively take command of the situation in the crisis hours of the coup was certainly a major error of the coup planners. It was an e:ror in the planning of the coup, not in its execution. Euharto did not escape from would-be kidnappers, as did Nasution. No effort was ever made to capture him. At the various target homes, the attacking parties followed the same general tactics. One-third of the force stood guard on the streets around the house, tone- third surrounded the house itself, and one-third entered the house to bring out the victim. A member of the Tjak- rabirawa Palace Guard told each general that he was wanted by Sukarno at the Palace immediately. It is clear from the reports of the kidnapping oi Harjono and Pandjai7an, that they. at least, suspected that they were being ar- rested on orders of the Palace. Harjono even went soi far as to cry out that he was about to be. murdered. When he resisted further, he was, in fact, the first general shot that morning. A little later, General Pandjaitan was also shot and killed resisting capture. Generals Suprapto, Sutojo, and Parman, quickly overpowered, blind- folded, with their hands tied behind their barks, were forcibly pushed into the waiting trucks and rushed back to Lubang Buaja.* Meanwhile, the larger raiding parties were hand- ling what was expected to be a more difficult assignment --the capture of Generals Yani and Nasution--whose homes .*For a more detailed account of the actual capture of - the generals in their homes, see Indonesian Upheaval by John Hughes, Davis McKay Company, Inc., 1967, pp:�T6-42. -3- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 were normally more heavily guarded. At Yani's house, the attacking troops managed to engage the guards in conver- sation, telling them that they had an urgent message for Yani from the President. Seeing their Tjakrabirawa uni- forms, the guards apparently suspected nothing until the invading group was near enough to overpower and disarm them. Yani himself does not seem to have doubted the story that Sukarno wanted to see him at once. He merely asked for time to bathe and dress. However, when he was told that there was not time for that, he apparently be- came angry and struck one of the men. Thereupon, they opened fire on him. Like the others, his body was car- ried out of the house, put aboard a truck, and taken back to Lubang Buaja. The attack on General Nasution's house was on the largest scale of all, altogether, about one hundred men were involved. That General Nasution--who was in tile house at the time--could have escaped from such an ambush, with 60-70 soldiers surrounding his home and another 20- 30 searching the house, seems almost unbelievable. It was one of those twists of fate that all but re-shape history. The one and only failure in the execution of the coup, it was to prove nothing less than a major disaster for the coup leaders. 4 In part, it was due to mistaken identity. Awakened by the commotion outside, the Nasutions had quickly de- termined that someone was trying to kidnap General Nasu- tion. They locked the door to their first-floor bedroom and, while the troops outside were still struggling with the door, Mrs. Nasution quickly led her husband through the next room, down a corridor and out a side entrance near the wall adjoining the residence of the Iraqi Ambas- sador. In Nasution's own words: I climbed the wall and from the top of the wall I first saw that my daughter Irma had been shot in the back. I was going to come back to face the soldiers that had done it, but my wife prevented me, imploring me to save myself. -4- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The road from Halim to Djakarta, the route travelled by the raiding parties on their mission to kidnap the generals Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 \"...they shall not have died in vain.\" General Yarn - General Harjono General Suprapto General Sutojo General Erman General Pandjaitan Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 It later was determined that my house was closely surrounded. The person guarding the wall was only a few meters away, but I was protected from his view by a dense growth of vegetation near the wall. At the moment I jumped from the wall I was fired at by the Tjakrabirawa troops who were guarding the side of the house, but...none of their bul- lets struck me. I heard the men who were shooting say something like, 'Someone escaped at this side. He wasn't hit.' After jumping from the wall I hid behind a water barrel in the yard of the Iraqi ambas- sador's house.* While hiding there I thought to myself, 'Why is the Tjakrabirawa staging this raid and trying to kill me? The Tjak- rabirawa is the palace honor guard of the President. ...Perhaps the President has listened to slander and ordered the Tjakrabirawa troops *In jumping the wall between his house and that of the Iraqi ambassador next door, Nasution broke his ankle. To some degree, his broken ankle was probably responsible for his removal from the scene in the days immediately after the coup. Of course, the tragic death of his daughter as a result of the wounds she received during the raid on Nasution's home on the morning of 1 October was the main thing that preoccupied Nasution for weeks after the coup. The picture of Nasution hobbling around on crutches at the funeral of the slain generals on 5 October and the funeral of his own daughter several days later will probably never be forgotten by most Indonesians. -5- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 to shoot me in my own house without a hear- ing!' I knew that I repeatedly had been slandered in untrue reports received by the President. I thought of trying to get to the house of Deputy Prime Minister Leimena, which was nearby (across the street from the house where I was hiding). I believed that he would not betray me if I asked for help in contacting the President and asking why � the Palace had ordered the Tjakrabirawa troops to shoot me in my own house. I gave up this idea after considering that I would have to go out on Teuku Umar Street to reach Pak Leimena's house. I knew that the street certainly would be controlled by the Tjakrabirawa. I decided to remain hidden and wait for morning and the chance that help would come from my own troops. ...Prior to the 1 October 1965 incident I had not received at my house, in either an official or unofficial capacity, reports or information that an incident of this type would occur...My escape was not due to any foreknowledge I had of the (coup) plans. It was due solely to the assistance and pro- tection of Almighty God and the help of my wife that I escaped abduction and murder. t. Inside Nasution's house, confusion reigned. Clutch- ing her bleeding child in her arms, Mrs. Nasution hurried to the telephone to call a doctor. A few moments later, she was not prevented from driving away from the house with her wounded daughter and a servant to the Army Hospi- tal. Meanwhile, the soldiers continued to search the large house. By this time, Nasntion's adjutant, Lt. Pierre Tendean, a man of the same general build and ap- pearance as Nasution, though much younger, had had time to put on his chief's uniform-jacket and cap. He went out to the front pavilion to meet the attackers. The detail commander said: \"General Nasution?\" Tendean -6- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 l.

What is it?\" He was immedi- ately overpowered and bundled into a truck, and the con- voy set off for Lubang Buaja. It was just 5:00 a.m. There is one final detail about the kidnapping raids that should be clarified because of the persistent confusion on the point. It concerns the supposed attack on Deputy Prime Minister Leimena's house. When the raid- ing party arrived at General Nasution's home, the troops first moved to disarm any armed guards (assigned to the homes of certain government officials) on the street. It so happened that Leimena's house, two doors down and across the street from Nasution's home, had a three-man guard in recognition of his status of Second Deputy Prime Minister. One of the guards came down the street and was shot by mistake. His was the only death other than those of the generals and Lt. Tendean to result from the coup action in Djakarta that day. No attempt was made to enter Leimena's-house or to trouble him further. The only objective was to prevent the guards at his house from coming to the rescue of Nasution. No doubt, because of the death of the policeman guarding Leimena's house the incident received immediate and perhaps greater at- tention than some of the other raids on the generals' homes. It was assumed that Leimena had been a major target of the coup. In fact, the targets were the seven army generals; no one else. The killing of Leimena's guard was purely accidental. Suharto Takes Command of the Army Besides the heroism of Lt. Tendean in posing as General Nasution, thereby helping to save the life of his chief at the loss of his own, and the calm presence of mind of Mrs. Nasution in a crisis situation, it was the quick thinking of another member of the Nasution household that frustrated the coup plans for a fait accompli--the elimination of the top army leadership-- -7- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 before the.army could react to the first staggering blow. Namdan, an aide of Nasution, contacted the Djakarta gar- rison commander Major General Umar Wirahadikusumah, on the special KOTI communication system, sometime around 0515 hours. General Umar went directly to Nasution's house, arriving there about 0530 hours; shortly thereafter, five tanks he had ordered also arrived. As the vehicles of the raiding party had been seen to at off in the direction of Bogor, General Umar ordered a pursuit by the tanks in tbat direction. The effort was not successful, however, as the tanks were unable to catch sight of any of the fleeing trucks or buses. Nasution, still in hiding next door in the yard of the Iraqi Ambassador's house, heard the commotion of the arrival of the men and tanks under General Umar, but uncertain as to who it was, he dared not come out of hid- ing. Not until about 0630 hours when he saw Col, Hidajat Wirasondjaja, the commander of the headquarters detach- ment of the Armed Forces Staff, near the wall did he ven- ture to reveal himself to anyone. The colonel, one of Nasution's adjutants, and his brother-in-law accompanied Nasution, concealed on the floor of the car, to a safe place not far from KOSTRAD headquarters. .4 General Suharto has given a detailed account of how he first learned about the raids that morning and what actions he took as the senior surviving general of the army (except for Nasution, whose whereabouts were still unknown). About 0530 hours, a neighbor of Suharto arrived at the General's home to inform him that shoot- ing had been heard down the street. (Suharto was head of the neighborhood association that was concerned with law and order in the neighborhood; members were respon- sible for reporting anything unusual that they saw or heard to the head of the association.) Shortly there- after, Suharto received a message from General Umar that a number of Army generals had been abducted by unknown parties. There was no information of the fate of the generals, and it was incorrectly reported that Deputy Prime Minister Leimena had also been taken. -8- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Suharto did not hesitate. In his own words: I concluded that the leadership (of the Army) was paralyzed. I knew that without leader- ship things would become even more confused. I was the senior officer in the Army after the Commander'.of the Army (Yani) and was ordinarily designated to represent him when he went abroad...I decided without hesitation that I would take over the leadership of the Army until something was learned of the fate of its commander. As my driver had not yet arrived, I drove a jeep to KOSTRAD headquarters myself, arriving there between 0630 and 0700 hours....Soon General Umar arrived and was able to provide clearer information as to what had happened... He said that he had gone to several of the generals' homes ' and then to the Palace but was unable to meet with the President. He did see General Supardjo at the Palace, how- ever, which surprised me, since I dia not know he was in Djakarta.* I told General Umar that I was taking over the leadership of the Army; he agreed. I issued my first order to him, which was that all troops be placed on stand-by but Lhat they not be allowed to go out except on my orders. This was done because we did not know who was friend and foe...and we wanted to avoid shooting until we knew. *As Commander of the 4th Combat Command of KOSRAD in West Borneo, General Supardjo should have been at his post near Manggaian in West Borneo. Suharto would have known that he was in Djakarta if he had been there for proper reasons--either official or personal. His presen,!,'! in the capital, unknown to Suharto, was thus immediately suspicious. -9- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The Show of Force in Djakarta Simultaneously with the raids on the homes of the generals, the coup forces had fanned out in the center of Djakarta, seizing control of the most important instal- lations, above all the Palace and the radio station.* The troops used in this phase of the coup were those of the 454th Battalion and the 530th Battalion minus the one company from each that had been sent on the raiding mis- sions. The two battalions mustered about 1,000 men each. As in the case of the army units assigned to kidnap the generals, these troops were dressed in regular army uni- form and armed. There were no civilians, armed or unarmed, among them, as far as we know. By 0600 hours component units of these two batta- lions were stationed at different points around Merdeka Square, in front of the Presidential Palace, and around the radio station. General Umar had seen the troops on his drive to KOSTRAD headquarters to report to General Suharto. He was able to identify them as elements of the 454th and 530th battalions, which had arrived in Djakarta only two days previously to take part in the Armed Forces Day parade on 5 October. Since Suharto kne* that these troops were to have taken part in a rehearsal for the parade that very morning and thus should not have been where they were, he could calculate that he *The location of the Palace, the radio station, the telecommunications building, and the railroad station around one large square, Merdeka Square, in the center of Djakarta made it a relatively easy military operation to seize control of these vital objectives of any coup attempt. In this sense, Djakarta was the ideal city for a coup. All of the coup forces, except those involved in the raids on the generals' homes, were concentrated aibund Merdeka Square.

What was unclear was just who was giving the orders to these units. The Central Command in Djakarta Although Suharto did not know it, the Central Com- mand of the coup had established itself in the Aerial Survey Office building, next to the PENAS film studio, on the main road from Djakarta to Bogor. Situated near the juncture of the Djakarta-Bogor Highway and the road into Halim, the Aerial Survey office was only a few miles from Suharto's KOSTRAD headquarters. The five men who comprised the Command had been there most of the night, having moved there-from Lubang Buaja where the3 had in- spected the troops sometime around midnight.* Of these five men Suharto would have been personally acquainted with three of them--the three who were in the military. He would never have heard of the other two--the two civilians in the group. 1. Lt. Col. Untung, aged 40, was a battalion com- mander of the special Tjakrabirawa Honor Guard that guarcEd President Sukarno. Newly appointed to the .job, he had commanded the 454th Battalion of the Diponegoro (the Central Java Territorial Division) until a few montl-!.. before the coup. Although limited in some respects and politically naive, he was well-thought of as a military officer and was considered to be on his way up in the Army. *One of the men who composed the Central Command, Air Force Major Sujono, had not arrived at the Aerial Survey Office until 0630 hours; the others had come several hours earlier, as soon as they had completed their re- view of the troops at Lubang Buaja. -11- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 2. Air Force Yajor Sujono, aged 45, was Regimental Commander, Air Base Defense Troops (PPP) in command of the troops that were assigned to guard Halim Air Force .Base, a major air base some seven miles distant from Djakarta. 3. Col. Latief was Commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Territorial Command, a post which in- volved control of a number of the mobile battalions in Djakarta. 4. Sjam, aged 42, was a man whose true identity -was known to only a very few people. The military of- ficers involved in the coup knew him only as Sjam--one of his several aliases. They all accepted the fact that he spoke for the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), with- out asking too many questions. Actually, they seem to have had some idea (whether they knew for sure or notL that he represented Aidit, the Chairman of the PKI per- sonally.* Sjam's true identity and function in the PKI or- ganization have now been clearly established. (It must be remembered that we now know more about the secret party organization of the PKI before the coup than we 4 have ever known about most other Communist parties. Be- fore the coup, only a few of the most trusted members of the PKI itself would have known of the secret organi- zation Sjam headed, and even fewer would have known the identity of the man who ran the organization.) Sjam's real namewas Kamarusaman Bin Achmad Mubaidah, and he was *At his trial, Untung testified: \"It is true that Sjam stated that he was a friend of Aidit; on one occasion, he said he was a messenger from Aidit, who had ordered him to attend the meetings in order to be in on the plan- ning of the 30 September Movement. Whether this happened to be true or not, I did not know. My understanding was That he was simply from the PKI.\" Apparently, Sujono and Latief and the others had the same vague understanding of who Sjam really was. -12- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 the Chief of the Special Bureau of the PKI--the clandestine arm of the PKI. Established as a special apparatus for handling those matters that could not be accomplished through the overt PKI organization, the Special Bureau was primarily concerned with military matters, in par- ticular PKI penetration of the Indonesian military organi- zation. Among those in the military whom the Special Bureau -managed\" were Air Force Chief of Staff Omar Dani, Brig. General Supardjo, Col. Untung, Col. Latief, and Air Force Major Sujono.* (Apparently, Sjam personally \"managed\" Brig. Gen. Supardjo, while the others were \"managed\" by subordinates of his in the Special Bureau.) In its operations, the Bureau was apparently entirely free of the control of the politburo and maintained direct contact only with Aidit. 5. Pono, whose real name was Marsudidjojo, was a subordinate of Sjam as the second-ranking membert,of the PKI's Special Bureau. His job was to \"manage\" PKI con- tacts in the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Territorial Command (Latief's brigade), the PPP units guarding Air Force installations (Maj. Sujono's regiment), the Tjak- rabirawa Palace Guard, and the Djakarta Military Police. *These men were not necessarily Communist (in the sense of being Communist party members) because they had regular contacts with important PKI persons connected with the Special Bureau. They all deny being Communists and that may well be true, although it is also possible that one or two--like Dani or Supardjo or Untung--were \"sleepers.\" There are some reports that Untung and Dani were secret party members, but there is no convincing evidence that this was true. Certainly, they were pro-Communist, and, being sympathetic to the party and its aims, they were able to be used by the PKI for ,its own purposes. The PKI \"managed\" them in the sense' of directing their thinking and their actions along certain lines. In carrying out � the coup under PKI direction, they were in fact agents of the PKI, whether they chose to look at it that way or not. -13- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Pono personally \"managed\" both Latief and Sujono.* In addition to the five men of the Central Command whom we know were at the Aerial Survey Office Building from the early morning hours, General Supardjo arrived there abodt 0400 hours while it was still dark; he, too, had visited Lubang Buaja earlier in the night. As com- mander of the 4th Combat Command of KOSTRAD in West Borneo, General Supardjo should have been at his post near Manggaion in West Borneo. He had no official reason to be in Djakarta, and he had not reported his presence there to Army Commander Yani or KOSTRAD Commander Suharto. As we shall see later, only a few persons--int.luding President Sukarno and Chief of the Air Force Dani--knew that he had arrived in Djakarta on 28 September, osten- sibly to visit his sick daughter. In connection with events on the morning of 1 October, he had been given the assignment of contacting the President, with the purpose of informing him of the action that had been carried out against the generals and/or taking him to Halim Air Force Base, where a safe place had been prepared 4 *The third-ranking member of the Special Bureau--Walujo (whose real name is Subono) had the assignment of \"manag- ing\" pici contacts in the Air Force (excluding the Air Force PPP troops that guarded Air Force installations) and the Palace Guard. Thus, he was the PKI contact man for Omar Dani, Untung, General Pranoto, and others. He was not a member of the five-man Central Command of the coup, however; in fact, he is not known to have played any role in the coup or in the planning for it; his only known involvement was his presence at the 29 September meeting of the Central Command that was concerned with last-minute preparations for the coup. Since Walujo had been Untung's contact man from the Special Bureau, Untung had not met either Sjam or Pono before September 1965, when the planning for the coup got underway. He seems to have appreciated the fact that these men were all close associates of Aidit, however. At his trial, he stated that Pono was ''also a buddy of Aidit, just as Sjam was.\" -14- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Supardjo Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The Central Command fral s old 11r11, Sjam Untung I.

There is reason to think that Supardjo actually intended to accompany Sukarno to Halim, although the coup leaders have preferred to explain Supardjo's mission as simply that of informing the President of the coup action that morning. Originally, Police Commissioner Anwas and Air Force Col. Heru were to accompany Supardjo in the party to in- form Sukarno, and they were to await word from Lubang Buaja that all the generals had been taken captive. How- ever, Anwas did not arrive at the Aerial Survey Office and, for some reason, Supardjo left before the Central Command had received a report from Lubang Buaja.* The commanders of the 454th and 530th battalions--Major Su- kirno of the 454th and Major Bambang Supeno of the 530th-- had just arrived at the Aerial Survey Office to report on the successful securing of the Palace and the radio station, and it was decided that they would go wit!? Gen- eral Supardjo and Col. Heru to see Sukarno. The delega- tion arrived at the Palace around 0630 hours. It is important to an understanding of Sukarno's actions that day, as well as to an understanding of the source of the conflicting reports that all of the generals had or had not been captured, that one keep in mind Uhat Supardjo left on his mission to the Palace under the im- pression that the kidnapping raids had indeed been a suc- cess. He was not to learn otherwise until some hours later, when he finally arrived back at Halim Air Force Base and after he had seen Sukarno. *In commenting on the change of plans, Supardjo has said simply: \"It was decided to bring the President after the report that General Parman had been secured was re- ceived\"--without explaining why it was decided not to wait for word about the other generals. Obviously, the coup group was confident of success. And it may be that time was pressing, and they were anxious to have Sukarno safely in their custody. -15- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Sukarno Hears the News The exact whereabouts of President Sukarno and his -actions on the day of the coup have been fairly well estab- lished by a variety of sources. On the evening of 30 September, Sukarno had addressed the National Conference of Technicians at the Senajan Sports Stadium in Djakarta. Apparently, he returned to the palace sometime around 2300 hours. Shortly after that, he suddenly left again to spend the night at his wife Dewi's home, accompanied 011y b} his personal bodyguard. According to Dewi, Sukarno ',leas furious upon arriving at her house to find that she had not yet returned home from a party at the Hotel Indo- nesia. He sent a message for her to return home immedi- ately. Sukarno spent the night at Devi's house, arisiqg early in the morning as was his custom. It seems quite clear that he fully expected to be back at the Palace be- fore anyone might want to see him that morning. At 0600 hours, he was enroute to the Palace when he received a report on the car radio (on the Tjakrabirawa radio com- munication system) that shooting had occurred at the homes of General Nasution, Dr. Leimena, and General Pandjaitaa. Apparently, only the one personal bodyguard who had ac- companied Sukarno to Devi's house the night before knew where he was. Neither Col. Saelan, deputy commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, nor Capt. Suwarno, company commander of Battalion I of the Tjakrabirawa, who were on duty at the Palace that morning had been able to locate him earlier, around 0530 hours, when they first received a report from Chief of Police Sumirat about the kidnappings. It might seem that Sukarno had deliberately put himself out of touch with the rest of the government machinery in order to protect his options as events de- veloped--assuming that he knew beforehand of the coup plans. At other times of crisis in the past, it had been characteristic of him to disappear from the scene and remain incommunicado at some unknown hiding place until the situation cleared. In this case, however, he defi- nitely seems to have been on his way to the Palace and would have been there in time to receive Supardjo if -16- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 everything had gone according to plan. Certainly, Supardjo and the other coup leaders expected to find him there. Col. Saelan and Capt. Suwarno had first looked for Sukarno at the home of Harjati, another of his wives. Not finding him there, they had finally succeeded in con- tacting the President on the car radio. Having learned from Chief of Police Sumirat that the Palace was surrounded by unidentified troops, Saelan ordered the presidential party not to enter the Palace but to proceed to Harjati's home in Grogol. By the time Sukarno arrived there, Saelan had received a later report that General Nasution had escaped his abductors, that the general's aide had been abducted, and that his daughter had been wounded. Saelan reported the news to the President as soon as he came inside Harjati's house. That Sukarno first learned the true story of the raid on Nasution's.home--before Supardjo (who was then at the Palace) heard the news and before Untung and the rest of the Central Command at the Aerial Survey learned the true facts and, apparently, even before those at Lubang Buaja recognized the mistaken identity of Lt. Tendean, certainly before those at Halim Air Force Base were informed--is a crucial fact about the coup that.thas never been mentioned in any account of the coup. It gave Sukarno an advantage of time that the leaders of the coup did not have in considering their course of action in the light of the unexpected escape of Nasution. After Sukarno received Saelan's report, he is re- ported to have said that it came as an \"absolute surprise\" to him. It is unclear whether he meant the news of the action taken against the generals or the news of Nasution's escape. He then asked Saelan: \"What will you do with me?\" On the grounds that Devi's house, Harjati's house and the Palace were not safe, Sukarno made the decision himself to go to Halim Air Force Base, where he would be near an airfield in case of an emergency. Preceded by an escort, the President and his entourage were driven to Halim, arriving there about 0930 hours. He was welcomed at the air base's Operations Command Center by the Ministel/ -17- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Commander of the Air Force, Omar Dani, who seemed to be expecting him. There is an unaccounted-for period of almost three hours from the time that Sukarno arrived at Harjati's house to the time that he must have left for Halim to arrive there at approximately 0930 hours. Apparently, he was at Harjati's house the whole time. He may have been awaiting word on the fate of Nasution. Sometime after 0630 hours, Lt Col. Ebram, the head of the Tjak- rabirawa intelligence section, and several of his men arrived at Nasution's house on the orders of the Presi- dent, they said, to ask about the whereabouts and safety of General Nasution. No doubt. Sukarno did order such an independent check on the report that Nasution had escaped. Col. Ebram was the head escort of the Presi- dential party on the trip to Halim, so he was clearly acting on behalf of Sukarno that morning. He was unaOle to establish the truth regarding Nasution's whereabouts. The Murder of the Generals As already suggested, the Central Command at the' Aerial Survey Office had not heard the news of Nasution's escape. As a matter of fact, they did not learn about the unexpected turn of events until they had disbanded the Command Center at the Aerial Survey office and moved back to Halim Air Force Base. Around 0800 hours, Lt. Dul Arief, who had been in command of the troops on the raids to the generals' homes, arrived at the Aerial Survey Office to report to Untung and Latief in person on the success of his mission. He had just come from Lubang Buaja where he had discharged his final duty in turning over the generals to lir Force Major Gatot Sukrisno, who had been designated to receive them there. As of that moment, it is clear that Arief did not realize the error of the mistaken identity of Lt. Tendean. He reported that four generals (supposing one to be General Nasution) had been captured alive and three had been killed in the process of capturing them. -18- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The well at Lubang Buaja in which the bodies of the generals were found Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 As to the fate of the generals at Lubang Buaja, they were taken inside a tent as each arrived on separate trucks at slightly different times. A reliable witness to the scene has described events as follows: When I entered the tent I saw 7 men treated as prisoners (he must not have realized that three were already dead) who were in a sad condition. Some lay on their backs, soiled and bloody, and two sat down, their hands bound and eyes covered with a red cloth. I heard a member of the Tjakrabirawa say: 'Yani has already been killed.' An officer of the Tjakrabirawa with the name Dul Ariel on his uniform was (issuing orders). The tent was near a small house with an old well close to the kitchen of the house. Att. about half past six in the morning I saw some civilians crowd around the old well scream- ing 'Crush the unbelievers.' I saw then how the persons who had been lying on their backs were carried out of the tent and thrown into the well. This was followed by a burst of fire from an automatic weapon aimed into the well by a member of the Air Force who had two white stripes on his shoulders. Then a hand- cuffed prisoner was taken to the wel:. His eyes were covered before he was thrown head- first into the well, followed by a burst of rifle fire. I was afraid. Then a soldier of the Tjakra- birawa came over to me and said 'You need not be afraid. This killing takes place on the orders of the President because these people are members of the Council of Generals and wanted to kill the President on Armed Forces Day. We are killing them therefore before they can kill the President. You know that it is the task of the Tjakrabirawa to protect the President.' -19- .t Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 I saw how the last prisoner was dragged to the edge of the well, but I could not see his face clearly, as it was scratched and soiled with blood. He was thrown into the well like the others. The civilians piled litter and leaves in the well. and I saw how a helicopter hovered above us, apparently to watch the people work- ing around the well. I could not see who was in the helicopter. The initial Army accounts of the killing of the generals placed great emphasis on the alleged torture and mutilation of the generals by the civilians mentioned above, who were Communist youth and women in military training at Lubang Buaja. This theme found lurid elabora- tion in many instances. Without doubt, these stories suffered from severe inflation. All of the victims except possibly Lt. Tendean were shot without any hint of torture or mutilation. Lt. Tendean may have received several blows from rifle butts before he was shot. There was none of the ghastly mutilation of the bodies that was recounted in the press, however. For the death of the generals and the actual circumstances of the deaths, the military officers at Lubang Buaja--and they alone-- must bear the responsibility, it would seem. There is no convincing evidence that the PKI civilians who were at Lubang Buaja for military training (and who were armed by the Air Force later that morning to serve as \"reserve troops\" for the coup) played any significant role in the murders--except as witnesses to the scene.* *The \"confessions\" of the members of the PKI youth and women's organizations that were implicated in the as- sassinations leave the impression that they were little aware of what was happening and that they might have been used unwittingly. Their accounts of the murder scene differ markedly, so that it is difficult to put much faith, in any of their stories. No doubt many of the \"con- fessions\" were contrived by the army. In other cases, some of the people interrogated may have been in shock at seeing the murders and, later, they were unable to recall precisely what they had witnessed. -20- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The Coup is Proclaimed At precisely the moment that the generals were meeting death at Lubang Baaja, an impatient Captain Suradi was waving a pistol at the announcer of Radio Indonesia who was reading the morning news broadcast. With some 20 of his men standing guard outside the building, the captain, who -was acting as commander of the troops dis- patched to secure the Palace, the radio station, and the telecommunications building, had forced his way into the broadcasting room and threatened the station manager and the announcer if they refused to read a statement over the radio that he wanted broadcast. They agreed to read it at the end of the first news report of the day. And so at 0710 hours the official announcement of the coup was broadcast to the nation. In announcing the fact that a movement \"directed against the generals who are members of the Council of Generals\" had taken place that morning, the statement repeatedly stressed that the action was purely and simply an internal Army affair. Untung, as commander of the movement, assumed full responsibility for what he called \"preventive action against a plot by the Generals' Coun- cil, a CIA-sponsored subversive movement...which planned to stage a coup on 5 October.\" The generals involved were said to have been arrested, and President Sukarno and \"a number of other public figures who would have been targets of the Council of Generals\" were said to be \"safely under the protection of the 30 September Move- ment.\"* *It is to be remembered that at 0710 hours, when this announcement was made that Sukarno was under \"the safe protection of the 30 September Movement,\" the President was still at Harjati's house, and the coup group had not yet made contact with him. Under these circumstances, it was a remarkably confident assertion to make unless the coup leaders had some prearranged understanding with Sukarno that he would be taken to some agreed upon place at a certain time that morning. -21- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The announcement was notable for the absence of the usual perfunctory praise of Sukarno; his name was scarcely mentioned except for the fact that he had been taken to a safe place. It was almost inconceivable that 'anyone staging a coup in Indonesia in 1965 would not have tried to make use of Sukarno's authority to swing public support behind their movement. Regardless of the facts, one would have expected the coup leaders to make a public statement claiming that they were acting on orders from Sukarno, to protect Sukarno from his enemies, to safe- guard the Indonesian revolution. The fact that Sukarno was mentioned only as being \"under the protection of the 30 September Movement\" created a vague impression that the coup might be anti-Sukarno. The only other credible explanation, if this was not the case, ..was that the con- spirators felt that it would look better if Sukarno were not directly associated with the removal of the Generals but were to emerge later to give his blessing to the qpup. In this case, one could hypothesize that Sukarno must have held out the promise of making a subsequent broad- cast announcing his endorsement of the coup; either that, or the coup group must have felt absolutely confident that Sukarno would endorse their movement after the fact, even if he had not given his approval beforehand. The Central Command Moves to Halim The radio announcement was made at a time when the leaders of the 30 September Movement thought their move- ment had succeeded. Shortly afterwards, around 0900 hours, the Central Command moved from the Aerial Survey Office in Djakarta to Halim Air Force Base. This was not a re- treat; it was a move planned in advance as the coup moved into the political stage after the initial military action. Sukarno, Commander of the Air Force Dani and a yet unmen- tioned but important figure in the coup--D.N. Aidit, chair- man of the PKI--were already there or on the way. The principals were not together in one location at Halim; they were at three different places, all within a distance of less than one mile of each other. Couriers -22- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 were sent back and forth with important communications; for instance, General Supardjo served as the main liaison between the President and the Central Command of Untung, Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono. As far as we know, Sukarno never had any direct contact with any of these five men in connection with the coup, either before the coup, the day of the coup, or after the coup. He was in the company of Dani and Supardjo, mainly, while he was at Halim. Similarly, Aidit remained apart from the men actually directing the coup. He communicated with the Central Command only by courier and apparently with Sukarno and Dani not at all. Still, he was near enough to be in close touch with events as they developed, should his lieutenants Sjam and Pono need his advice Major Sujono had personally brought Aidit to Halim, picking him up at his home around 0200 hours that morning. He had made the arrangements himself for the use of the home of one of the enlisted men on the iyase; Aidit and his two bodyguards spent the day there. Dani appears to have spent the night at Halim's Command Opera- tions office, which included sleeping accommodations for the senior Air Force Command Staff. It probably would not have seemed extraordinary for Dani to sleep there. He, too, stayed in the one place the whole day of th(2; coup. Sukarno came directly there when he arrived at the base. The Central Command of the coup was installed in the home of Air Force Sergeant Sujatno, an aide of Major Sujono. Sergeant Sujatno had spent the whole day of the 30th as well as that night at the Aerial Survey Office, on a \"stand by\" order from Major Sujono. � *On the Morning of the 1st Sujono reportedly asked him if he could use his house at Halim Air Force Base for a while as his office. Sujatno drove ahead to get things ready for Sujono. Soon, Latief, Untung, Sjam, Pono and Sujono arrived. Sujatno's description of the five men while they were at his house seems worth quoting, as it gives the flavor of the day at the Central Command. -23- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 I was ordered by Sujono to get something to eat for these gentlemen. So we sat down and had some rice and SOME meat side dishes. When I went to get the rice in my room, I noticed that someone was sleeping in my bed.... It was Col. Latief. We sat eating for about an hour, and then Sujono called me and handed me an envelope, saying that I should take it to Capt. Suradi, who was supposed to be at Radio Republic... (When I got back) I was ordered to cook up some more rice. So I did. I noticed at this time that Untung had been seated in the back of the room, and neither changed his place nor said anything. There were two civilians *there and I asked Sujono about them, and he answered that I didn't need to know. Then, after I had cooked enough rice for them, I was ordered by Sujono to take a sealed envelope to Air Sergeant Suwadi's place, which was located within the complex. When I got there, someone met me at the door; I learned later from Sujono that the man was Aidit. I had to wait three or four minutes there, and then I was given a small envelope containing a reply and was ordered to deliver it. Aidit gave me the envelope; he was wear- ing glasses. 9 General Supardjo had arrived back at Halim only a little while after Untung and Latief and the others. He came from the Palace by helicopter. (Omar Dani had sent the helivopter from Halim to pick up Supardjo after word had been received that the President was not at the Palace.) Dani is reported to have welcomed Supardjo with the exclamation \"Success:'' Then he explained that Sukarno would soon arrive at the air base. Since it would still be a little while before he could report to the President, Supardjo asked Dani for permission to meet with the leaders of the .oup at Sgt Sujatno's house -24- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 in order to obtain the latest information on the develop- ment of the coup from the Central Command. Sgt. Sujatno has confirmed that Supardjo came to his home soon after the other coup leaders arrived and that he joined them at the first meal served that morning. There is no in- formation as to what was discussed, but presumably the formation of the Revolutionary Council was one of the topics. General S.Ipardjo signed the Decree establish- ing the Revolutionary Council while he was at Sgt. Sujat- no's house with the Central Command at this time. The New Order is Announced The Decree was one of three important orders is- sued by the Central Command that morning: Decree No. 1, which was signed by Untung, Supardjo, and Air Force Colonel Heru, concerned the formation of the Revoltition- w ary Council; Decision No. 1, which was signed by Untung only, listed the members of the new council; and Deci- sion No. 2, which was also signed only by Untung, con- cerned ranks and promotions in the military. Untung has said that it was approximately 1000 hours when he signed the Decree and about 1100 hours when he signed DecisWns No. 1 and 2. This would check perfectly with the time, as best we can calculate it, that Supardjo was at the Central Command. We know that he arrived there after Untung and the others did, around 0930 hours; he and Untung could well have signed the Decree at just about 1000 hours, as Untung claims. At 1100, when Untung is supposed to have signed the Decisions, Supardjo had left the Central Command and was with the President.* *There seems to have been a two-hour delay in the case of both the Decree and the Decisions between the time that the orders were signed and the time they were first broadcast on the radio. The apparent disagreement be- tween various sources on the matter of the timing of the broadcasts would seem to result from the fact that the (footnote continued on page 26) -25- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The point to be emphasized in connection with the timing of these orders is that they were signed before Untung and the rest of the Central Command learned of Nasution's escape though they were broadcast after they had finally received an accurate report. Untung seems to have made no attempt to stop the broadcasts after he realized that Nasution had actually escaped, but perhaps there would not have been time to do it, or he may have *.oht that it was already too late to stop them. The importance of settling the matter of the time that these orders were signed and then broadcast lies in the fact that it argues against the thesis that the Decree establishing the Revolutionary Council was an ad hoc deci- sion of the Central Command, a last desperate effort of a failing movement. It has been argued that the coup lead- ers were obviously improvising at this point in the un- foreseen situation of having missed one of the prime tar- gets of the coup and having failed to get the public dnp- port of Sukarno for their undertaking. In support of this hypothesis, it is argued that the rather peculiar assort- ment of names on the Revolutionary Council could only reflect an extemporaneous selection; furthermore, there is the established fact that many, if not most, of the persons on the Revolutionary Council had not been consulted ahead of time. The argument simply does not stand up in the face of what is known to have been the time sequence of the orders. Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence that the Revolutionary Council was always part of PKI plan- ning for the coup, even if some of the major participants (footnote continued from page 25) orders were re-broadcast at regular intervals after they were first announced. Thus, Decree No. 1 was first broad- cast at 1200 and again at 1300 and 1400 and 1430 hours. Untung heard the 1200 broadcast but Sukarno didn't hear the news broadcast about the Revolutionary Council until 1430 hours. The so-called Decisions were first announced at the 1300 hours broadcast. -26- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 pproved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 4.1 coz r, �hoproi 1.110 4.0,1 Of 10 'ft \"0 1�Ont o '19 DOS ,^F�14 �pnr Ow.

Sjam is reported to have brought the original copy of Decree No. 1 out of his briefcase at Sgt. Sujatno's house. According to Untung, \"we took turns reading it, first myself, then Supardjo, and then Lt. Col..Heru. Then we signed it.. .I was (already) acquainted with the contents and purport of the decree.\" The purpose of the Decree was to eliminate the Generals' Council from the Dwikora Cabinet. We didn't mean to eliminate Sukarno from the cabinet. We intended that Sukarno would ap- point a new cabinet, but the Decree said that the Revolutionary Council would appoint it. The precise formulation contained in the Decree was as follows: .With the collapse of state power into the hands of the Indonesian Revolutionary Coun- cil, the Dwikora Cabinet is considered to be decommissioned. Until a new cabinet is formed by the Indonesian Revolutionary Coun- cil, the former Ministers are authorized to conduct routine business, to maintain peace and security within their respective depart- ments, but are prohibited from appointing new officials or taking any actions of con- sequence. *The evidence as far as Sukarno's knowledge of the Revolutionary Council is concerned is contradictory. - For a fuller discussion of this point, see p. 91. -27- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 For the time being, the Indonesian Revolu- tionary Council will be the locus of all authority of the Republic of Indonesia... As agencies of the Indonesian Revolution- ary Council, provincial revolutionary councils will be formed, as well as regency revolutionary councils, district revolu- tionary councils, and village revolutionary councils, with the councils consisting of both civilian and military personnel who support the 30 September Movement unreserv- edly. At the least, the statement is ambiguous. There is ab- solutely no mention of Sukarno in any context--a most curious omission. The office of the Presidency is not even mentioned. It is left entirely to one's own inter- pretation whether there would be any change in the ofice, either in the person holding the office or the power of the office itself. With the announcement of Decision No. 1 of the 30 September Movement, it was clear that Sukarno was not a member of the Revolutionary Council, whether it was pre- sumed that he would continue as President or not. Untung was to serve as Chairman of the Council, and General Supardjo, Air Force Col. Heru, Navy Col. Sunardi, and Police Commissioner Anwas were to be the vice-chairmen. Omar Dani, Air Force Major Sujono, and Col. Latief were among the other 40 members. Thus, with the exception of Sukarno and Aidit and Aidit's two high-level agents, Sjam and Pono, all of the major participants of the coup who were at Halim were included as members of the Council. The coup group may well have intended.that Sukarno's authority remain as before in the new government but may have had special reasons for not wanting to mention his name in connection with the coup. 'As we will see later, this was probably the explanation for the curious omis- sion of any reference to Sukarno in the Decree. It may not have occurred to them that their declaration might be construed .as being aimed at the President rather than simply at the cabinet. Under the circumstances, however, -28- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 of its being absolutely routine to praise Sukarno at length at every occasion, the failure to make any reference what- soever to the President was quite likely to be interpreted as an indication of anti-Sukarno motives. The Decree seemed to convey the impression that the President had been put aside. It is possible, of course, that the coup leaders did not intend that Sukarno continue as President, with undiminished powers. If so, the PKI must have been plan- ning a double-cross of the President and some of the mili- tary leaders involved in the coup who clearly believed that they were acting in support of Sukarno. (This point is examined later, in connection with the testimony of various individuals who were involved in the planning of the coup.) From the point of view of the PKI, the Revolu- tionary Council would have been the perfect Nasakom Cabinet that the party had long been pressuring Sukarno to form.* On the face of it, its membership was representativle of the major power groups in Indonesia. Almost half of the 45 members were government officials, a few of them high- level, like Foreign Minister Subandrio and Deputy Prime Minister Leimena. Among the leading political figures were the top party leaders, either the chairman or the secretary-general, of the seven major non-Communist ppli- tical parties. There was no Communist party leader of equivalent status; of the five known Communists on the Council, three were lesser known members of the PK1 Cen- tral Committee. In the case of the military, which com- posed the other half of the Council, there had obviously been the same deliberate effort to have all four of donesia's armed services--the army, navy, air force, and *As the most immediate goal in its long-range plan to seize power peacefully, the PKI was demanding equal repre- sentation with the Nationalist and Religious parties in Indonesia in a so-called \"Nasakom\" cabinet. The word \"Nasakom\" was a word coined from the first letters of the. Indonesian words NASionalis (nationalist), Agama (religious), and KOMunis (Communist). -29- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 police--represented. Among the Army officers included were 6 Generals �of the Army, one of them being Gen. Umar Wirahadikusumah, the Commander of the Djakarta area who had been first on the scene at Nasution's home, after the raid on his house. Gen. Umar was one of the many Council members who have categorically denied knowing any- thing about the Revolutionary Council before they heard their names read off on the radio as members of the Council. A high-level PKI official has said that even the PKI members on the Council were not informed ahead of time nor was their approval requested. Actually, the Revolutionary Council was the per- fect Communist front organization. With only one-ninth of its membership known to be Communist, it included as many well-known anti-Communists as Communists and pro- Communists together. From what was generally known at the time about its various members, therefore, Communist control of the group was not readily apparent. However, there was a group of middle-level military officers who were almost inconspicuous among the list of well-known figures; this group held the balance of power on the Council. Practically nothing was known about these men, especially their politics. Few people outside the In- donesian military had ever heard of Untung or Heru or , Sundardi or Sujono or Latief. It might be assumed that they were anti-Communist like the majority of the Indon- esian military. Who would have suspected that they were so totally under PKI influence, even if not Communist party members, that they were prepared to do the party's bidding, even to the point of conspiring to murder the top Army leadership? President Sukarno at Halim Soon after signing the Decree establishing the Revolutionary Council, General Supardjo left the Central Command at Sgt. .Sujatno's house and went back to Halim's Operations Command Center, where'the President had arrived at about 0930 hours. Sukarno had received a general report from Omar Dani but was awaiting a detailed report from General Supardjo on the events of the day. -30- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Supardjo's much-delayed meeting with the President, which finally took place about 1030 hours, has been the subject of conflicting stories, many of them pure specula- tion, no doubt. It would certainly be a major factor in determining the role of Sukarno in the coup if we knew for sure what transpired at the meeting. According to Untung (whose testimony on the coup seems to provide the most reliable and complete story of events), after General Supardjo reported on the coup and the kidnapping of the Generals, Sukarno asked two questions: (1) if it was true that General Nasution had been captured, and (2) why was Untung leading the movement. Supardjo replied that it was true that Nasution had been captured and that Untung assumed the leadership because \"he was the one consider- ed most appropriate by the comrades.\" Some reports have claimed that Sukarno also asked Supardjo where Untung was, but apparently it was General Sabur, the Commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard and Untung's0m- mediate superior, who had come to Halim at Sukarno's call, who asked Supardjo that question later in the day.* Ac- cording to the most well-known version of the Sukarno- Supardjo meeting (the official Army version), Sukarno is reported to have patted Supardjo on the back and said in Dutch: \"Good job.\" Although it is quite believable--and it may well be true--that he did this, it can not be troved. Supardjo denies it and Untung is not known to have com- mented on it. Similarly, there is disagreement as to whether or not Sukarno said to Supardjo: \"Now, then, I shall take over the leadership and appoint another Com- mander-in-Chief.\" Untung has denied that Sukarnc said *Apparently, General Sabur arrived at Halim while Supardjo was talking to the President. Once at Halim, General Sabur stayed close to Sukarno, accompanying him to Air Commodore Susanto's house (which was on the base) when the Presidential party moved there from Operations Command soon after 1200 hours. General Sabur remained with Sukarno all afternoon and finally accompanied him to the Presidential Palace at Bogor that evening after the collapse of the coup. -31- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 anything about taking over the leadership. Apparently, the subject of the new Commander-in-Chief of the Army did come up, because Supardjo asked that he be given an op- portunity to consult with his \"comrades\" on the matter. The President answered: \"Yes, all right, but return im- mediately.\" For a second time that morning, Supardjo went to the Central Command at Sgt. Sujatno's house and briefed Untung, Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono on the results of the meeting with the President. After conferring, they decided to recommend to Sukarno that he appoint Maj. _General Pranoto, then third assistant to Army Chief of Staff Yani, as the new Commander of the Army.* *General Pranoto had succeeded General Suharto as Com- mander of the Diponegoro (Central Java) Territorial Divi- sion. Apparently, Nasution had been responsible for his removal as Commander before his normal tour of duty in that command was up. During his years as commander of the Diponegoro Division, he is reported to have done noth- ing to obstruct Communist influence in the military. ' At the time of the coup, Pranoto was director of per- sonnel for the Army, which meant that he had authority in the crucial matter of military assignments. From the point of view of the PKI, he was ideally placed to serve the party's interests. Since the coup, it has been re- vealed that Pranoto was a \"contact\" of the PKI Special Bureau, just like Untung, Latief, Sujono, Supardjo, and Dani. He and Latief were both \"managed\" by Pono, the number two man in the Special Bureau and one of the cen- tral figures in the coup. Pranoto was known to be a close friend of Dani. It was rumored that his relations with Suharto were very cool, for personal as well as political reasons. In Pranoto, the PKI and Sukarno would have had a Commander of the Army as responsive to their wishes as Dani was as Commander of the Air Force. -3 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Apparently, the Central Command still had no defi- nite information that Nasution had escaped,. although by this time they seem to have been alerted to the possibility of this having happened. At both the Central Command and Operations Command there was general confusion and uncer- tainty as to what really had happened, as conflicting reports began to be received. When Supardjo re-appeared at Operations Command, the possibility that General Nasution had eluded his cap- tors was beginning to be seriously considered 'as more and more reports confirmed Sukarno's first information on the subject. For a matter of some hours now the Presi- dent had been in doubt. As early as 0630 hours he had received a report from Col. Saelan that Nasution had escaped. Since that time, he had been trying to verify that report. He had sent Col. Ebram to Nasution's house to check out the information, but the Colonel had ten unable to learn anything definite about Nasution's where- abouts. General Supardjo had assured him that reports of Nasution's escape were not true, but soon thereafter Gen. Sabur arrived at Halim to tell him just the opposite. It is difficult to establish just when Sukarno finally was convinced by the reports that Nasution had, escaped. As long as he continued to receive conflict- ing reports--which was all morning long and into the afternoon--he may simply not have known what to believe. In that case, he--and the rest of the coup group--may have made some of the important decisions of the day in a state of uncertainty, not knowing for sure what had occurred at Nasution's home but aware of the difference it made to their planning whether Nasution had escaped or not. At their second meeting of the day, which took place as soon as Supardjo returned to Operations Command following his conference with the coup leaders on the matter of the appointment of a new Army commander, Sukarno and Supardjo discussed the report that Nasution had escaped. According to Supardjo, the President said to him: \"It is Nekolim that will benefit. Yes, in a -33- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 revolution, such things will happen, and when they do it is Nekolim that benefits.\"* Again according to Su- pardjoiSukarno asked his advice about what to do now. Supardjo replied: \"It depends on Bapak (Indonesian word 'for \"father\" which was commonly used to refer to Sukarno). I have two battalions that are at the President's dis- posal.\" Apparently, Sukarno did not make a decision at that moment. It seems that Nasution's escape--or the possibility of it--had a profound effect on the President. If it was not the main reason, it was certainly a contributing factor in his final decision to stop the movement. We can only speculate.as to the main factor influencing Sukarno's decision. It may have been the failure of the coup to capture Nasution and realization that the coup plans had seriously gone awry. Or it may have been his shock and disapproval over certain aspects of the actlion, such as the murder of the generals, which he may not have anticipated. Or it may have been his concern that Suharto had rallied the army to oppose the coup in a way never anticipated by the coup leaders. Apparently, Sukarno was very much concerned to learn that two battalions of the RPKAD, the paracommando units of the Army under the command of Col. Sarwo Edhy, had arrived in Djakarta and were waiting further orders from Suharto. These two paratroop battalions, which had been stationed just outside the city, had been scheduled to depart for North Borneo several days before the coup. Unknown to Sukarno, their departure had been delayed be- cause of some confusion over transportation. Quite pos- sibly, the coup plans had taken into account the fact that the paratroopers would have departed for Borneo by the time of the coup; apparently, no one had checked to see whether they had actually departed on schedule. Sukarno is reported to have shown great interest in the Nekolim was an acronym for NEokolonialisme-KOLonialisme- IMperialisme, the three evil isms according to Sukarno. -34- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 RPKAD on the morning of the coup. According to a very reliable source, he protested to Supardjo at one point: \"You told me the RPKAD would not be in Djakarta.\" Supard- jo is reported to have assured Sukarno that it made no difference to the coup plans. However, around 1200 hours, Sukarno called Supardjo in to tell him of his decision to stop the movement. Ac- cording to Supardjo, the President asked him to talte care to prevent further bloodshed. Supardjo said that he and the two battalion commanders would see to this. Then, according to Supardjo, the President said: \"If you can't stop the movement, you'll be butchered.\" In the official Army version of events, Sukarno is reported to have said: \"Be careful. If you can't stop the-movement, I'm the butcher.\" If Sukarno ever had any intention of makingta pub- lic statement in support of the coup--as the coup leaders have intimated that he did--he had apparently given up all thought of it now. From the moment that he issued the order to stop the movement, his main concern was clearly to dissociate himself from it; he would hardly have considered anything that would implicate him further. 4 At this point, President Sukarno left the Opera- tions Command Center and moved to the nearby home of Air Commodore Susanto. Earlier that morning, Major Sujono had personally informed Susanto that his house would be occupied by the President at 0800 hours. (This would tend to confirm other indications we have that the coup lead- ers definitely expected Sukarno to join them at the air base that morning, either on his own initiative according to a prearranged plan or as a hostage of the coup group.) Apparently, Sujono had thought that Sukarno would go directly to Susanto's house when he arrived at Halim. Sukarno had asked to go to Operations Command first, how- ever, possibly because he wanted to see Omar Dani. Sukarno was to spend all afternoon at the home of Susanto; he was there until about 2030 hours when he finally left Halim to go to Bogor Palace. Amazing as it might seem under the circumstances he apparently spent -35- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 a good part of his time there just resting and sleeping --and listening to the radio. He was at Susanto's house when he heard the radio broadcast about the Revolution- ary Council. According to some reports, the President was surprised to learn about the establishment of such a Council. After the coup, he was quoted as saying that he disapproved of the Revolutionary Council; but, if that was true, he took no action whatsoever at the time to do anything about it. And the explanation for this would seem not to have been that he was a prisoner or virtual prisoner of the coup group and therefore not able to influence the course of events at Halim. On the contrary, Sukarno seems to have been very much his own free agent from the time that he went to Halim at his own initiative to the moment that he decided to leave for Bogor, several hours after Leimena and others at the airbase had first urgeO him to depart.* His complete independence of .action that day was certainly clear from the fact that he sent his own emissaries back and forth from Halim all afternoon. It was from one of these emissaries that Gen. Suharto at KOSTRAD headquarters first learned that Sukarno was at Halim. Sukarno sent a courier to Nasution as well as *After the coup, Sukarno repeatedly emphasized his \"freedom of action\" throughout the day at Halim and the fact that he had gone there in the first place of his own free will to avoid the threat of \"undesirable events\" in Djakarta and to be near an airplane in case of emerg- ency. It seems that he said this to prevent the Army from using his supposed \"arrest\" by the coup group and \"vicious PKI elements\" to destroy the PKI. He was con- cerned at all costs not to allow the Army to make it look as though the already implicated PKI had taken action against the President rather than against the Council of Generals. Despite his particular motives for stres- sing the point after the coup, it seems that he was not distorting history at all by emphasizing that he was not a-prisoner of anybody while he was at Halim. -36- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Suharto asking them both to come to Halim. Couriers dis- patched by Sukarno were also in touch with Gen. Sabur, Commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, Deputy Prime Minister Leimena, Gen. Pranoto, Navy Commander Martadinata, and Police Commander Sutjipto. The message was the same in every case, that Sukarno wanted to see these men at Halim immediately.* Clearly, Sukarno was under no restraint from the coup leaders in communicating with people outside Halim Air Force Base. One of his most trusted and loyal advisers--First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Subandrio-- with whom Sukarno was also now anxious to confer, was not in Djakarta at the time. He had left town on the morn- ing of the 29th, along with twelve other ministers of the cabinet, for an official inspection tour of Sumatra. (No specific reason for the trip was ever given.) On the *Apparently, Martadinata, Sutjipto, and Leimena checked first with Suharto before deciding to go to Halim. As we shall see, Leimena delivered a message to Sukarno from Suharto that the President should be out of Halim byt1630 hours, as Suharto was considering attacking the airbase if the coup forces had not surrendered by then. Leimena and Gen. Sabur were the only two men of those contacted by Sukarno who went to Halim. Suharto refused to allow Pranoto, Martadinata, and Sutjipto to go, on the grounds that the Army \"had already lost enough generals.\" It is not clear whether Sabur asked Suharto's approval, first, as Leimena did, or whether he went on his own, as soon as he received Sukarno's summons; most likely, it was the latter. It is surprising that Sabur was not with Sukarno when the President went out to Halim in the morning. As Commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, he was usually with Sukarno whenever he went anywhere. The where- abouts of Gen. Sabur had been one of the questions that everyone had been asking all morning. Where was President Sukarno? Where was Gen. Sabur? And why was he not at Halim if Sukarno was there? -37- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 afternoon of the 1st, when Sukarno suddenly had need of his confidant, Subandrio was in Medan. Sukarno ordered his own Presidential jet airplane, which was normally kept at Halim Air Force Base instead of Djakarta's com- mercial airport for reasons of security, to fly up to Medan to pick up Subandrio.* The President may have been in communication with Subandrio earlier in the morning to tell him of the news of the coup, but this is not certain. There is still some confusion about the first communication Subandrio received about the coup. Ac- cording to one story, he received a written note from a courier who said he was acting on instructions of the PKI representative in the North Sumatran National Front; this was about 1000 hours. Apparently, he was not informed that Sukarno's personal plane was on its way up to Medan to get 'him; he does not seem to have realized that until the plane was already there. Sukarno probably did not think of sending a plane for Subandrio until the earlyi. afternoon, when events made Subandrio's presence at Halim suddenly very important to him. Sukarno's independence of action at Halim extended to the use of the coup-controlled radio to broadcast a - Presidential statement to the nation. For everyone listen- ing to the radio that morning the most puzzling phenomenon of the day must have been the fact that the President did not speak. The original Untung.announcement had strongly suggested that he would soon appear and explain to the nation what was going on; but he did not. Finally, at 1330 hours, an announcement was read over the radio that \"Sukarno was alive, safe, in good health, and still in control of the state and the revolution. It was explained that the announcement was made on the authority of General Sabur, the commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential *It is unclear precisely when the Presidential plane left Halim; no one seems to have taken note of the time that they heard a plane overhead,'as they did later that evening when two planes departed Halim--one carrying Aidit and the other Dani--and a third plane landed (it was Sukarno's jet returning from Medan). -38- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Guard. Later, it was announced that Sukarno had tempor- arily taken ever the leadership of the armed forces and that he had appointed General Pranoto as the \"caretaker\" commander of the army \"to carry out the day-to-day busi- ness of the army.\"* In hindsight, the statement authorized by the Presi- dent and issued in the name of Gen. Sabur seems to have been a move by Sukarno to dissociate himself from a fail- ing movement. It may not have seemed that way at the time, however. Certainly, it was not the strong public endorse- ment of the coup by Sukarno that the coup leaders evidently expected him to make. The President carefully avoided committing himself on the coup. It might be presumed, however, that he was in agreement with what had been done since he did not condemn the action taken against the generals that morning. Moreover, in appointing General Pranoto as the \"caretaker\" commander of the army, he definitely was acting in the interests of the coup leaders. *In the opinion of some observers, Sukarno's appoint- ment of a \"caretaker\" commander of the army suggests 4 that he had definite information that the generals were dead. At the time, only the leaders of the coup and those directly involved in the killing of the generals knew this for sure. Sukarno could only have gotten this information from the coup leaders themselves. Suharto and the rest of the world, still in doubt about the fate of the generals, were quick to seize upon the announce- ment of Pranoto's appointment as an indication that Sukarno had inside information on what had happened to the generals; the announcement seemed to confirm their worst fears that the generals were already dead. In Sukarno's defense, however, it seems that this is not conclusive evidence. The President might have appointed a \"caretaker\" command- er of the army if he thought that the generals had simply been kidnapped and were being held some place. The \"care- taker\" commander would be just that; he would take charge of the army temporarily, until there was definite word about the generals. -39- Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 The one thing that seemed clear from he announcement was that Sukarno was not a prisoner of events. The fact that it was an announcement from the President, issued with the authority of his trusted security chief, and not an \"Untung\" announcement seemed to indicate that Sukarno was not the victim of any sort of coup attempt. But though the statement seemed to imply that Sukarno approved of the coup, that was not enough to save it. At a time when a public endorsement by Sukarno--and only that--might well have turned the tide in its favor, Sukarno refused to commit himself on the coup explicitly, publicly. It is quite clear now that the coup leaders felt themselves betrayed by the President, whether they had good reason to expect a public statement of support from the President or not. Col. Latief is reported to have been \"very aggressive\" in urging General Supardjo \"to force Sukarno to give his blessings to the movemer�t.\" He indicated that Supardjo should threaten Sukarno if he refused. It is clear that he had a radio broadcast by Sukarno in mind, as Latief is quoted as saying \"Bring a tape recorder, so that Sukarno's voice can be taped and broadcast,\" Major Supeno, Commander of the 530th battalion, who heard the conversation, drew the conclu- sion that there was a possibility that Sukarno would be., killed if he resisted their pressure. Although it was obviously a mistaken judgment, it suggests the amount of pressure the coup leaders tried to exert on Sukarno to get him to make a public statement of support. At this point, however. Sukarno was not about to be found support- ing a dying movement. He was maneuvering to preserve his independence of action whatever the outcome of the coup; in the statement broadcast over the radio he hoped to re-assert his own authority over the situation without committing himself on the events of the past several hours. This was, Of course, the turning point of the coup. The coup leaders had tried and failed to get Sukarno's support at a crucial stage, when their coup plans had seriously gone awry with the escape of one of the prime targets of the coup and when their last hope lay with Sukarno.

This had been made official in an order-of- the-day signed by Dani himself.* The explanation for what would seem to have been an incredibly poorly timed decision on Dani's part was that he had drafted the order early in the morning--when he apparently felt so sure things were going well that he was willing to commit the entire air force organization to the coup--but it was not broadcast until that afternoon. - Dani has given the following account of his actions that morning: I awoke (he had spent the night at Operation� Command) at .about 0600, bathed, etc.. till 0630. At 0710 I heard the radio news broadcast which mentioned the kidnapping of the army generals. Between 0730 and 0800 I received a telephone call from Major Suparto who said: 'Bapak (the President) will be taken to Halim.' I wanted to pick him up but Major Suparto would 4 not allow me. I called Major Sujono to take care of the President's security because the President was entering Halim. I remained at the Operations Command office and did not go outside. I then drafted the concept of my Standing Order. My custom in drafting an order was to draft points. I gave these points to Major Willyarto so that they could be refined before the order was sent to the Department of the Air Force. I told Major Willyarto not to broadcast the order yet. *Dani's statement appeared in Harlan Rakjat on 2 October, but it was announced over the radio before that, on the - afternoon of 1 October.
