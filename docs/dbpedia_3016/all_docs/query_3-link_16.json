        "text": "The recent suspension of General Wiranto from his cabinet security position has cleared the way for President Abdurrahman Wahid to press ahead with making the military a more professional force firmly under civilian control, according to Indonesian officials and other experts.\n\nMr. Wahid, in his capacity as supreme commander under the constitution, is expected to approve more than 40 changes soon in the top ranks of the armed forces, removing officers of suspect loyalty and consolidating his government's hold over the military.\n\nHe is also expected to reduce sharply the size of the army's special forces, a 6,000-member unit that is widely blamed for many human rights abuses in East Timor, Aceh and other parts of Indonesia.\n\nIn a further sign of change in the military, officials said that the army planned to relinquish all its seats in Parliament in the next elections, The Associated Press reported Friday.\n\nThe armed forces commander, Admiral Widodo Adisutjipto, told a special committee of legislators that the military wanted to give up the 38 seats it has reserved for its appointees in the 500-member Parliament.\n\nHe added that the military would remain neutral in the elections, scheduled for 2004.\n\nGeneral Wiranto was suspended by Mr. Wahid after he was implicated by an Indonesian inquiry into the wave of violence and destruction that followed East Timor's vote for independence from Indonesia last August.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
