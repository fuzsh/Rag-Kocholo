        "text": "The Indonesian military (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI) continues to press for an expanded role in internal security, driven by distrust of civilian politicians, contempt for the police and the conviction that Indonesia is facing hostile powers using proxies to attack it through non-military means. “The TNI’s concept of ‘proxy war’ turns an international threat into a domestic danger and therefore justifies a military role at home ,” says Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC). “Everything from the haze crisis to gay rights advocacy becomes evidence of foreign enemies bent on weakening Indonesian from within.”\n\nThe Indonesian military (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI) appears to be taking advantage of a weak president and unpopular police to try and regain some of the internal security functions that it lost as part of the country’s democratisation process. The government needs to strengthen civil control of the TNI and prevent the creep of military influence into areas unrelated to its core function of defence.\n\nIndonesia is perceived as a natural de facto leader of the International Organization of ASEAN since its establishment in 1967. Myriad factors have contributed towards this highly regarded position in ASEAN, including its persistence towards measures of regionalism, hence positioning ASEAN at the central core of Indonesia‟s foreign policies throughout the years. As one of the founding members of ASEAN, key past foreign policies have reflected an intention to shape the organization in a manner most ideal for Indonesia. Thus it is crucial to further understand in what nature and to what extent has Indonesia led ASEAN in the past, and what are Indonesia‟s prospects in leading ASEAN with the change of presidency that the state faces now. Based on those questions, the paper explores Indonesia‟s leadership role in ASEAN with focus upon Indonesia‟s historical role in conflict management correlated with ASEAN member states, and its capacity in architecting contemporary ASEAN institutions. It argues Indonesia‟s active ad hoc diplomacy in settling various security issues related to the territorial disputes over the Preah Vihear Temple between Cambodia and Thailand, and tensions in the South China Sea. It further argues Indonesia‟s vital role in establishing key institutions and norms including the ASEAN Political and Security Community and the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. Finally the paper focuses on Indonesia‟s ostensible rise, and its prospects in continuing its ASEAN leadership role under the newly elected Joko Widodo, pertinent towards the G20 and policy to reassure neighboring states of its non-belligerent rise\n\nAbstract: The Indonesian military sees itself as the guarantor of national unity, the state's last line of defence against separatist movements. This paper argues that the military's methods for maintaining national unity have been counterproductive. Its counter-insurgency wars in Aceh and Papua have exacerbated the sense of alienation from Indonesia that the people in these provinces have felt. In this post-Suharto era of political reform, the military has been unable to recognise that its old methods have failed, even after its obvious failure in East Timor, whose people, after living under a 24-year military occupation, rejected continued integration with Indonesia in a referendum in 1999. The fact that the politicians in the legislative and executive branches of the state have tended to encourage the military to persist with its old methods suggests that the military by itself should not be faulted. Only political resolutions, such as the Helsinki agreement for ending the conflict in Aceh – an agreement that resulted more from the devastation of the December 2004 tsunami than from the Indonesian military's counter-insurgency warfare – offer any guarantee of national unity.\n\nVarious International Relations works of literature positioned Indonesia as one of the leading countries in Southeast Asia, both formally and informally. Indonesia is considered a driving force behind various regional cooperations that lead to regional progress. This paper also sees that Indonesia is capable of initiating and pushing for cooperation in the peacekeeping area. Peacekeeping cooperation is sensitive in Southeast Asia, considering that one of the norms that mutually agreed upon since the formation of ASEAN is the norm of non-interference. The non-interference norms hinder regional peacekeeping cooperation due to its adoption of interventionist norms. Despite these organizational obstacles, Indonesia has successfully initiated peacekeeping cooperation that in the form of the ASEAN Peacekeeping Centres Network (APCN). The APCN aims to increase the contribution of peacekeeping forces from the ASEAN Member States in the UN Peacekeeping Missions. By looking at the case, this ..."
