        "text": "KARACHI: Chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq has joined the Pakistan squad in Hyderabad, which is set to host their World Cup opener against the Netherlands on Friday.\n\nInzamam reached the central Indian city on Wednesday and, according to the Pakistan media manager, may well be involved with the selection of Pakistan’s playing 11 for the fixture and overall team strategy.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain, who is officially assigned by the Pakistan Cricket Board to pick squads for series and tournaments — the World Cup in this case — would assume the aforementioned duties in the presence of team director Mickey Arthur and head coach Grant Bradburn, along with captain Babar Azam.\n\nInzamam’s involvement, however, will be subjected to the approval of the team management and the captain.\n\n“Depends on the team management and captain. If they want his inputs, why not,” the national side’s media manager told Dawn when inquired if Inzamam would take part in team selection and match strategy. “Of course, Inzi Bhai is a former captain and brings tons of experience,” he added.\n\nInzamam, coincidentally, was the Pakistan chief selector during its previous World Cup campaign and 2019 and had flown to England before getting reportedly in decisions which are ideally left to the team management and the captain.\n\nPakistan failed to make the semi-finals of the 50-over showpiece back then.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 6th, 2023"
