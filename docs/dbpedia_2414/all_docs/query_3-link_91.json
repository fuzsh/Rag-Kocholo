        "text": "Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Sunday raised concerns over the fresh allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch and said that the integrity of the securities regulator has been \"gravely compromised\".\n\nIndia Today has learnt that the CAS are reviewing United World Wrestling's (UWW) reules and regulations as they try to reach a verdict on Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Paris Olympics. Despite securing a place in the Women's 50kg wrestling final, Vinesh was disqualified ahead of the match for being overweight.\n\nMembers of the Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) of Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) staged a candle march from the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to the hospital in the capital on Sunday.\n\nBrazen civic apathy was again on display in Delhi as a 7-year-old boy drowned while playing in a waterlogged park in Rohini on Saturday. The boy, identified as Tarun, was playing in the park when he accidentally fell into the pond formed due to waterlogging and drowned."
