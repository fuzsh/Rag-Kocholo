The panel will submit its report and recommendations to the PCB in an expeditious manner. This was Inzamam’s second stint at the job, as he first held this role from 2016-2019.\n\nBy Tarkesh Jha\n\nFormer Pakistan skipper Inzamam ul Haq has stepped down as the chief selector of the national team after reports claiming he held a stake in a player’s management firm registered with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) surfaced in the media.\n\nThe said agency, named Saya Corporation, has top stars like Babar Azam and Muhammad Rizwan on board, which raised questions about the authenticity of the selection process.\n\nInzamam claims that he has voluntarily asked the PCB to hold an enquiry into the matter and expressed hurt at such allegations being levelled against him. Further, he denied having any involvement with the aforementioned company.\n\nAlso Read: Pakistan vs Bangladesh Preview World Cup 2023: Predicted XI, key players, pitch report, where to watch\n\n“We are cricketers and we are available all the time to serve the country. Since I am facing an inquiry, and as the nature of my job is, I should step down and let them conduct the probe,” Inzamam stated.\n\nHe added, “I am a human and it hurts. I have a 20-year cricket career during which I represented Pakistan. I am not someone who people don’t know. When such allegations are levelled, it hurts.”\n\nMeanwhile, the PCB has established a five-member fact-finding committee to look into the matter. The panel will submit its report and recommendations to the PCB in an expeditious manner. This was Inzamam’s second stint at the job, as he first held this role from 2016-2019.\n\nInzamam and his committee have been under-fire lately for the poor performance of the national team in the World Cup. The Babar Azam-led side has lost four matches in a row, and are now gearing up to take on Bangladesh amidst all this controversy at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on October 31.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
