While the Tramboo brothers clinched a Rs 30 lakh deal on the show for their business idea centered around Kashmir willow bat manufacturing, the established bat manufacturers in Kashmir have raised serious objections against what they perceive as misinformation aired on the Sony Entertainment Television network. The Cricket Bat Manufacturers Association of Kashmir (CBMAK) has come forward, accusing the participants and the television network of disseminating incorrect data about Kashmir willow bats. Fawzul Kabir, the association's spokesperson, emphasized that while they welcome new entrants into the industry, they cannot allow anyone to undermine the hard work and dedication of the established manufacturers. According to Kabir, the main bone of contention lies in the portrayal of the Tramboo brothers as the sole manufacturers of Kashmir willow bats, which is allegedly false. Kabir asserts that the factory shown on the reality show belongs to Alfa Sports, a member of their association, and not to Tramboo Sports as depicted. The CBMAK has issued a legal notice to Sony and the participants, demanding an apology and compensation for the damage caused to the reputation of the indigenous industry. They argue that the misinformation has adversely affected sales and tarnished the image of the industry, putting thousands of livelihoods at risk. However, Saad Tramboo of Tramboo Sports refutes these claims, stating that they never portrayed themselves as the only manufacturers and emphasized the goal of promoting Kashmir willow bats globally. Saad clarifies that Tramboo Sports operates through manufacturing collaborations with multiple facilities, including Alfa Sports. As the controversy rages on, it underscores the importance of accurate portrayal and representation in the media, especially concerning industries vital to local economies like Kashmir's cricket bat manufacturing sector. The outcome of this dispute will likely have significant ramifications for all stakeholders involved. https://lnkd.in/dVwAVzX3 #SharkTankIndia #Kashmir #CricketBatManufacturing #Controversy #MediaRepresentation\n\nüîîSaudi Arabia Eyes Multibillion-Dollar Stake In Indian Premier League Let's take you back to where it all started one of Saudi's first sporting investment started in 2014 when WWE was brought into the country it saw wrestlers like John Senna featuring it and the country has regularly kept pumping in the Moola when it comes to sports Reports say at least 6 billion have been spent on sporting Investments since 2021 and this figure is before the mass Exodus of staford Ballers to Saudi shows now it's a no-brainer if big names are attached to an event it will draw more attraction fans watch sports because their role models are in it it's this strategy that the kingdom is tapping into this massive influx of money into sporting events has caused controversy critics are calling it sportswashing what does that mean when Saudi hosted its first f one Grand Prix in 2021 for example human rights groups accused the country of using these events to clean up its tarnished image in the International Community ... üëá #NoToSaudiSportswashing\n\nNow here‚Äôs an interesting question to ponder upon- Do we need more cricket and less Bollywood? Have you ever thought about whether do we need more cricket and less Bollywood? We just had a long weekend, and many of us would have scrolled through the numerous OTT platforms looking for what to watch-and perhaps , ended up watching cricket either due to- lack of options or patience etc . But, you know what? here‚Äôs an perspective that thinks cricket is becoming more popular than Bollywood. What do you think about that? #cricket#bollywood\n\n#kabbadi Kabaddi is basically a combative sport, with seven players on each side; played for a period of 40 minutes with a 5 minutes break (20-5-20). The core idea of the game is to score points by raiding into the opponent‚Äôs court and touching as many defense players as possible without getting caught on a single breath. One player, chanting Kabaddi!!! Kabaddi!!!! Kabaddi!!!! Charges into the opponent court and try to touch the opponent closest to him, while the seven opponents make maneuvers to catch the attacker. This is Kabaddi, the match of one against seven, known as the game of struggle. The players on the defensive side are called ‚ÄúAntis‚Äù while the player of the offence is called the ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù. The attack in Kabaddi is known as a ‚ÄòRaid‚Äô. The antis touched by the raider during the attack are declared ‚Äòout‚Äô if they do not succeed in catching the raider before he returns to home court. These players can resume play only when their side scores points against the opposite side during their raiding turn or if the remaining players succeed in catching the opponent‚Äôs raider. The origin of the game dates back to pre-historic times played in different forms. The modern Kabaddi game was played all over India and some parts of South Asia from 1930. The first known framework of the rules of Kabaddi as an indigenous sport of India was prepared in Maharashtra in the year 1921 for Kabaddi competitions on the pattern of Sanjeevani and Gemini in a combined form. Thereafter a committee was constituted in the year 1923, which amended the rules framed in 1921. The amended rules were applied during the All India Kabaddi Tournament organized in 1923. The All India Kabaddi Federation was formed in the year 1950 to look after the promotion of the game and the Senior National championship started from the year 1952. The new body, Ama¬¨teur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) came in to existence from the year 1972 affiliated to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) with a view to popularize the game in India & neighboring countries of Asia. After formation of this body, Kabaddi took a new shape and National level competitions started for Junior and Sub-junior boys & girls also #snsinstitutions #snsdesignthinkers #snsdesignthinking\n\nIndian cricketer Hardik Pandya recently took the drastic measure of filing a police complaint against his brother-in-law, Vaibhav Arora, citing a prolonged period of family discord and disturbance caused by Vaibhav's behavior. The complaint led to Vaibhav's arrest, marking a significant development in the matter. Sources close to the family have revealed that Vaibhav's conduct had been a source of tension within the family for an extended period, with reports of heated arguments and disagreements between Vaibhav and Hardik, as well as with other family members. Hardik's wife, Natasa Stankovic, is Vaibhav's sister, and it is believed that Vaibhav's actions had been affecting their marriage as well. The exact nature of the discord is not clear, but it is understood that Vaibhav's behavior was deemed serious enough to warrant a police complaint. Hardik's decision to involve the authorities suggests that the situation had become untenable and that he felt compelled to take action to protect his family. The arrest has generated significant interest in the media, with many speculating about the details of the case. However, the family has not released an official statement, and it is unclear what the next steps will be in the investigation. This incident serves as a reminder that even high-profile individuals like Hardik Pandya, who is widely admired for his cricketing skills, can face personal challenges and family conflicts. It highlights the importance of addressing such issues and seeking help when necessary. Furthermore, this situation may also have implications for Hardik's career, as he is currently an important member of the Indian cricket team. The stress and distraction caused by the family conflict could potentially impact his performance on the field. In conclusion, the arrest of Vaibhav Arora following Hardik Pandya's police complaint marks a significant development in the matter of family discord. While the details of the case are not yet clear, it is evident that the situation had become serious enough to warrant legal action. The incident serves as a reminder that personal challenges can affect anyone, regardless of their status or profession. . . . #MIvsGT #MumbaiIndians #HardikPandya #IPL #Cricket #IndianCricketTeam #CricketNews #SportsNews #pandyabrothers #VaibhavPandyaArrest #tribunetrends"
