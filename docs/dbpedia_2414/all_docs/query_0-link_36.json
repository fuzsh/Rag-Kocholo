One of the other directors of this U.K.-based company is from an agency that represents leading Pakistan cricketers such as captain Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi and Mohammad Rizwan.\n\n“I am stepping down from the post (of chief selector) to offer the PCB an opportunity to conduct a transparent inquiry,” Inzamam said in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board.\n\n“If the committee finds me not guilty, I will resume my role as the chief selector.”\n\nInzamam was appointed chief selector in August then also put in charge of selecting national junior teams this month.\n\nHe was previously chief selector from 2016-19.\n\n___"
