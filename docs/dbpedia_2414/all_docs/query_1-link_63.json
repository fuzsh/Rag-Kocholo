        "text": "While the T20 World Cup 2024’s biggest success story has to be Afghanistan cricket, the biggest talking point for all the wrong reasons is the Pakistan cricket team. From the team’s shambolic performance on the field to former Pakistan cricketers, a lot of them disgruntled if I may add, have been on a tirade against their own players, and have time and again targeted the Indian team as well.\n\nJoining this list is, surprisingly, one of the slightly saner minds in Pakistan cricket, former chief selector and one of the finest batters of his era, Inzamam ul Haq. The Former Pakistan skipper, talking about India’s win over Australia in their final Super 8 Group 1 fixture, raised alarms over Arshdeep Singh managing to reverse the ball in the 15 over itself and went on to add that the Umpires should keep their eyes open to spot these things.\n\n“Arshdeep Singh when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over, Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things,” said Inzamam during a talk show.\n\nAlso in the panel during the talk show was Inzamam’s former teammate Salim Malik and he too chimed saying that when it comes to certain teams eyes remain shut.\n\n“Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained I was fined quite heavily,” said Malik, who was the first player to be banned – from all cricket – for match-fixing, when Justice Qayyum’s inquiry found him guilty in 2000.\n\nInzamam went on to add that if a Pakistani bowler managed to reverse the ball this early, a lot of noise would have been made. “If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue (shor mach jaata). We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO HERE:\n\n“Because for reverse swing … look Bumrah can do it, because of his action; but for some bowlers – their action and their speed, the ball has to be in that perfection condition and prepared well (to reverse). It could be that the wicket was hard and rough, that could be the reason (for the ball getting scruffed up on one side), but these things have to be noticed”."
