As per his agent, Inzamam was stable but under observation.\n\nA family member said that Inzamam felt uneasy and complained of having difficulty in breathing on Monday.\n\nHe was taken to a private hospital where, after several tests, it was revealed that he might have had a minor attack. Doctors advised him to undergo an emergency angioplasty and well-known heart surgeon, Professor Abbas Kazim, performed the procedure.\n\n\"Inzamam is now doing much better and will be released soon from hospital. He is okay now,\" one family member said.\n\nInzamam is Pakistan 's highest run-getter in ODIs with 11701 runs in 375 matches, and the country's third-highest in Tests with 8829 runs in 119 matches. He was also among the country's most successful captains.\n\nInzamam had retired from the International game in 2007 and has since held several positions in Pakistan, as a batting consultant and then the chief selector from 2016 to 2019. He has also worked as head coach of Afghanistan."
