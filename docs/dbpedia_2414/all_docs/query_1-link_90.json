        "text": "Pakistan were led by the talismanic Imran Khan during the 1992 World Cup Down Under and the legendary all-rounder had cherry-picked a talented youngster named Inzamam-ul Haq on a hunch. And on this day back 24 years back, Inzamam repaid that faith in the crucial semi-final against New Zealand in Auckland.\n\nChasing 263, Pakistan seem to be going nowhere until Inzamam and Javed Miandad joined hands and added 87 from 10 overs, with Inzy smashing 60 from just 37 balls. Pakistan pulled off a four-wicket win with six balls to spare and then clinched the title in the final while Inzamam went on to become one of the finest Asian batsman of all time.\n\n1874: Queen’s Park beat Clydesdale 2-0 to win the first Scottish Cup final.\n\n1941: Joe Louis knocks out Abe Simon in 13 rounds for the heavyweight boxing title.\n\n1971: Playing his second Test, India’s Sunil Gavaskar scores the first of his 34 Test hundreds, against West Indies in Guyana.\n\n1973: Frank Mahovlich becomes fifth NHL player to score 500 goals."
