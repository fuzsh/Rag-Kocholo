Just like Nagi was found at fault, looks like Inzi will also be found guilty\n\nFact-finding committee collects details of agents approved by PCB\n\nLAHORE: The five-member fact-finding committee formed by the Pakistan Cricket Board to investigate the allegations of conflict of interest regarding the role of Inzamam-ul-Haq as chief selector, with several players in the Pakistan cricket team on the roster of the same agency, held its first meeting on Tuesday where it collected details of the players’ agents approved by the PCB.\n\nInzamam had resigned from his post on Monday after news of his affiliation with UK-based Yazoo International Ltd came to the fore, with the former Pakistan captain on its board of directors alongside Talha Rehmani, who also manages Saya Corporation which represents superstars like captain Babar Azam, wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan and pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi.\n\nSources told Dawn that the committee will present its report to PCB interim management committee chairman Zaka Ashraf on Nov 6, the last day of his four-month tenure.

Our intention was to venture into business, but unfortunately, we didn't achieve success.\n\nI was informed that Saya Corporation handles cricketers contracts, including my own, and they specialize in brand endorsements. The decision regarding the central contract was reached in June, a period during which I was not present. I arrived in August, by which time the names and categories had already been determined.\n\nFor many months, the central contract was not signed because we couldn't agree on its terms. I had been here for a month, and the board asked me to step in and help resolve the disagreements in the team caused by this contract issue.\n\nI managed to settle the matter in a meeting between Babar Azam and Zaka Ashraf. I advised the team captain not to worry about the ICC revenue for now, as it will likely increase in the future. I believe I should be given credit for solving this problem.\n\nThe board has all the records of the Saya Corporation, and it's not hidden. I'd like to mention that my company has been operating for four years.\n\nDo Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and other cricketers play solely due to my influence? Even when I wasn't the chief selector, they continued to play. Prove how I had controlled the players?\n\nMany people asked why I took the Chief Selector role when others declined. I now regret my decision.I resigned so that proper inquiry should be made."
