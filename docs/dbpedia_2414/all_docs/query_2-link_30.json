        "text": "Younis has a fair bit to go before catching up with Dravid especially if you're a guy who rates overseas performances more.\n\nI rate performances individually as opposed to using blanket terms like home or overseas. Away performance against Sri Lanka or WI mean a lot less than some of the knocks he played against England in the UAE in 2012 series which was played on bowling tracks(check the batting averages for both teams). YK's overseas record is top notch anyway, RSA notwithstanding, it's more an issue of volume since he hasn't played away from home as much as others have but when he has, he has produced the goods. YK, in my book, wins a lot of points for his performance in back to the wall situations where he's head and shoulders above anyone from Pakistan and on that front. The 67* in the fourth innings in RSA in 2007 or the double century at the Oval are truly special knocks and had he been from any other country, he'd be mentioned along the greats of the game based on his fourth innings performance alone.\n\nI rate performances individually as opposed to using blanket terms like home or overseas.

I rate players against best sides of their era, ATG bowlers and overseas knocks.\n\nNot sure how much he has performed against Australia, South Africa of 2000s or Sri Lanka with Murali. Feel he needs to be more consistent overseas. Plays a very good knock in one inning but puts in sub par performances in the other matches of the series. He has always been good in New Zealand, so I'm sure he will do well there. It is against raw pace (mainly because of his unorthodox technique) he has his struggles, will be interesting to see how he goes in Australia. The tracks have been flat over there, still their bowlers (Starc, Cummins, Hazelwood, Pattinson) are top notch imo when fully fit.\n\nFair enough.

The tracks have been flat over there, still their bowlers (Starc, Cummins, Hazelwood, Pattinson) are top notch imo when fully fit.\n\nConsistency isn't an issue so much as lack of overseas games is. He has played few matches abroad but apart from SA and WI, whenever he has played he has performed. In Australia, he has played only one three match series where he averaged 43 against McGrath, Warne and Gillespie in the early 2000s before Australian pitches became replicas of Faisalabad. Out of six innings, he scored under 40 in only two. In 9 matches in England, he averages 51 and in five or six matches in NZ he averages 65. His hundreds are also usually big ones and scoring them in ridiculous, almost hopeless situations is something no other batsman in the last 20 years does as well as him. He has only played 25 tests in the four traditional \"green/bouncy pitch + good pacer\" countries of England, NZ, Australia and RSA, and in those 25 tests he averages 46 with a 50+ average in two countries, 40+ in one and under 40 in only one with a fifty plus score every third innings so he has done well in the few opportunities he has had abroad. His impact on the result of the games is evident too by the fact that in the 6 games Pakistan won out of the aforementioned 25, YK averages 92.\n\nAura, presence and other such intangibles are secondary to producing the goods when it matters and on that front, YK is in a class of his own as far as Pakistani batsmen are concerned. As a frame of reference, from India I'd say Inzamam is somewhere between Dravid and Laxman. YK is basically up there with Dravid and both Inzamam/YK are a notch above Yousuf.\n\nYK is couple of notches below Dravid as a batsman.YK simply doesnt have the volume of runs overseas.Like Dravid does.And Dravid still avgs some points ahead of YK in away avg outside Asia.I am not even bringing the ODI performances.\n\nInzamam is ahead of YK.First there is the ODI performances gap and then there is overall quality gap.Both havent done well in Aus and SA.so we will leave that.Inzamam did well againist the Walsh and Ambroses in WI while YK struggled in WI.Inzamam did as well as YK in India SL or NZ.And he did this with Murali Kumble etc in full flow.\n\nYK did better than Inzy in Eng but than Inzy played in 90s.\n\nAnd Moyo is close to YK because he has a poor away record in most places except WI NZ and ENG.\n\nYK is couple of notches below Dravid as a batsman.YK simply doesnt have the volume of runs overseas.Like Dravid does.And Dravid still avgs some points ahead of YK in away avg outside Asia.I am not even bringing the ODI performances.\n\nInzamam is ahead of YK.First there is the ODI performances gap and then there is overall quality gap.Both havent done well in Aus and SA.so we will leave that.Inzamam did well againist the Walsh and Ambroses in WI while YK struggled in WI.Inzamam did as well as YK in India SL or NZ.And he did this with Murali Kumble etc in full flow.\n\nYK did better than Inzy in Eng but than Inzy played in 90s.\n\nAnd Moyo is close to YK because he has a poor away record in most places except WI NZ and ENG.\n\nLol, there aren't even that many notches. There are essentially three tiers for batsman averaging 45+ in tests, four if you consider Bradman a tier unto his own. At the top you have the Tendulkars, Laras, Viv Richards of the world. Then there are the likes of Dravid, Sangakkara, YK etc. and finally you have the lowest tier for batsmen like Jayawardane, Laxman, Inzamam and Yousuf. The use of sheer volume of runs is a conflict in our methodology because in India, that is actually used as a measure of a player's caliber. In Pakistan, we use averages(Shahid Afridi is an exception because his averages don't support what people want to prove). YK would naturally have fewer runs than Dravid overseas since he has played 65 matches fewer than Dravid in England, Australia, NZ and SA(25 vs 90) but both average about the same (45.8 vs 46.5), score 50+ at the same rate(1 every 3.5 innings vs 1 every 3.4). Both have won about the same percentage of games (24% and 28.8%) but YK's 90 odd average clears Dravid's 59. All said and done, while Dravid may be marginally better, there's no way he's entire notches above YK. At best, he's situationally better by a slight margin.\n\nThere's a reason I didn't bring up ODI performances because if you read my posts in this thread from the beginning, it's clear I'm concerned specifically in tests. When you use the generic term 'batsman', I automatically jump to tests. In my book, a batsman is defined first and foremost by tests. ODIs are secondary. That said, Inzamam is undoubtedly a much better ODI batsman than YK but YK is an entire tier above him in tests(as opposed to Dravid and YK who are generally in the same tier in my book). I don't see where you get the notion that YK hasn't done well in Australia considering he's only played one series there which was against McGrath, Warne and Gillespie, and he ended that series with an average of 43 and four scores of 40+ in six innings. This series was played in 2004, before YK became the YK we know today(that transformation started a year later). Inzamam playing in England in the 90s is no different to YK playing RSA in the 2000s, well after they stopped their 90s policy of making placid tracks for Pakistan tours and Steyn+Philander+Morkel>Donald+Pollock. Besides, England's bowling attack in the 90s was so rubbish that they essentially took the pitch out of the equation. Refer to the 1996 tour of England to see how hard England was in the 90s and compare that with the 2016 tour.\n\nYousuf isn't even in the same league as YK so a comparison there is just pointless.\n\nIndians just get to play more overseas, can't do much about that. The ODI business is really a red herring. YK is a rubbish ODI player we won't need to argue that. But why are we not talking about IT20s then? Did Dravid ever win an IT20 WC for India?\n\nWas never talking about LOIs.\n\nWhile getting to play more overseas is definitely a valid argument, playing overseas is always a test and you never get easy runs there. Anyway, I still rate Miandad as the best ever bat from Pakistan purely because of the bowlers he faced. You can call it a bias or anything else, but I always rate batsmen who performed better in 90s followed by 2000s and this decade the last of them all. It's due to a variety of reasons but to put it simply, 80s, 90s and also 2000s had legendary bowlers along with ATG teams. Whereas in this decade, there isn't an ATG bowler apart from Steyn while South Africa was the only ATG team which was present at the top for a significant period. Also wickets have become a bit flatter as well.\n\nBut above all that, my gripe with Younis is he doesn't dominate a series consistently. I mean, he plays a gem of a knock but switches off in the rest of the series. Also his record against strong teams is very good but not great as well. Australia, South Africa and England were the top 3 teams of the last decade. Australia especially was an ATG team and arguably the strongest team ever.\n\nAverages of batsmen against those 3 sides in the last decade (min 600 runs) are:\n\nMoYo 53.23\n\nSRT 49.47\n\nLaxman 47.65\n\nSehwag 45.74\n\nSanga 45.62\n\nDravid 45.06\n\nInzi 45.02\n\nYK 40.60\n\nAverage of batsmen against those 3 sides \"away from home\" in the last decade (min 600 runs):\n\nSRT 55.60\n\nLaxman 53.57\n\nDravid 50.35\n\nMoYo 46.03\n\nYK 43.08\n\nSanga 41.44\n\nInzi 34.21\n\nSouth Africa was the one truly ATG team of this decade but apart from them, not many teams have been great. Most other teams have been HTBs.\n\nAverages of batsmen against South Africa (till 2014 assuming it as the end of their ATG team):\n\nClarke 80.25\n\nSRT 77.00\n\nLaxman 67.80\n\nMisbah 52.09\n\nSehwag 48.22\n\nSanga 35.20\n\nYK 35.00\n\nHe scored a very good century in South Africa along with Asad but again wasn't too impressive in the other innings. I think Younis is probably at par with Sangakarra atm, he can surpass him by good performances in NZ and Aus. He is an absolute beast in Asia and is one of the batsmen you can depend upon in 4th innings. But think his record against great teams isn't that great. I'm pretty sure he will perform in NZ, he has always been strong there. But will be interesting to see his performance in the tour of Australia as they are a very strong team at home even though they are very weak in Asia.\n\nAs far as Pak's batsmen are concerned, I think Miandad has to be probably their best ever. Inzi had a great talent but underachieved. Younis maybe isn't that gifted like his peers in technique, yet he has overcome many hurdles and is Pakistan's most mentally strong bat ever. Haven't watched much of MoYo honestly, but probably would have finished with a Sanga like career if not for his premature retirement. Younis is Pak's 2nd best test batsman ever imo behind Miandad.\n\nLol, there aren't even that many notches.

Refer to the 1996 tour of England to see how hard England was in the 90s and compare that with the 2016 tour.\n\nYousuf isn't even in the same league as YK so a comparison there is just pointless.\n\nYK is nowhere near Sangakkara or Dravid he is a notch below Inzy let alone Dravid and Sangakkara.\n\nYK avgs 42 outside Asia\n\nhttp://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/en...rderby=default;template=results;type=allround\n\nDravid avgs 52.3\n\nhttp://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/en...rderby=default;template=results;type=allround\n\nYou are comfortably taking out WI because Dravid has done well there while YK has struggled.Not to forget Dravid played againist Walsh Ambrose and Bishop.\n\nCan you post a link to that win percentage thing.\n\nPitches everywhere around the world in 90s were much more bowler friendly then they are now.So Inzy's performance in Eng in 90s is definately comparable to what YK has done in Eng in 2000s.And in 90s England had specific bowlers who would exploit the english conditions better than the tourists.\n\nYK is a notch below Inzy and atleast a couple of notches below Dravid in the peking order.\n\nThe first Test of the three-match series between Australia and Pakistan in 1994 makes for one of the most dramatic and thriller Test matches played between the two countries. For the major portion of the match, Australia were convinced that they will be registering their first win in Pakistan after 35 years. However, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed put up a fine show on the final day to steer their team to a one wicket-victory. The two veterans stitched a crucial 57 run-stand for the tenth wicket, the then highest last-wicket partnership to win a Test.\n\nOne of the greatest Tests between Australia and Pakistan saw Australia opting to bat first and posting 337 runs on the scoreboard. It was a flamboyant batting performance by the visitors as Michael Bevan hammered 82 runs while Steve Waugh returned with a sublime knock of 73 runs.\n\nIn response, Pakistan put up a good show but fell short of 41 runs. The team scored 256 runs on the back of an 85 run-knock by the opening batter, Saeed Anwar. Australia returned with 232 runs in their third innings as Pakistan were given a herculean task of chasing 314 runs in the final innings to record a victory.\n\nThe last innings saw a lot of action and drama as there was a constant shift of momentum between the two sides. The hosts got off to a good start as Anwar smashed 77 runs while Aamer Sohail also added 34 runs to the scoreboard. What followed after that was a collapse of the Pakistan batting unit.\n\nAustralia was asking some tough questions from the opposition and the hosts didn’t have an answer. The Saleem Malik side soon fell to 258 for nine and a historic victory for Australia after 35 years almost looked certain. However, Inzamam, who came to bat at eight, along with the eleventh batter Mushtaq scripted history on the 22-yeard pitch.\n\nThe duo helped Pakistan emerge from the dead by slamming 53 runs in just eight overs. In the end, the equation boiled down to Pakistan needing three runs while Australia wanted just one wicket. Shane Warne provided the wicketkeeper, Ian Healy, a brilliant chance to do stumping and bring another twist in the game. However, Healy missed the stumping chance, and the ball went for four byes. That was an end to the iconic match as Pakistan won the nail-biter by one wicket\n\nhttps://www.news18.com/cricketnext/...-to-win-a-test-against-australia-4271324.html\n\n? VVS has played some clutch knocks but, Inzimam was overall a far superior batsman and his record across the formats will prove that. VVS averages 45 vs Inzimam’s 50 which is a big difference. Laxman scored just 17 100s in 134 test matches. Inziman had 25 in 120. As a bonus not to forget Inzi’s record in ODIs where Laxman was really poor.\n\nI am not sure how its even a comparison let alone saying poor man’s VVS.\n\nI have observed that Indian fans tend to over rate Laxman as a player because of some really good knocks he has played. He was a fine batsman and was decent across the surfaces but, not in the league people try to present him to be in. Happy to debate based upon facts and numbers.\n\nSome clutch knocks? Lol\n\nVVS has played far more clutch and iconic knocks. He has played against the toughest team of his time and bested them on most occasions. Choreographed wins in Australia and South Africa where Inzamam was a passenger all through his career.\n\nSurprised that you are so hung up on numbers and averages where the difference isn't as large as you say - at all. VVS's 46 to Inzamam's 49.xx - a difference of 3.xx runs. The same difference you see between Ponting and Kallis but how many will choose the latter over Ponting?\n\nVVS had lesser centuries because he batted mostly at number 5 and 6 and was almost always batting with the tail. But of course, he more than makes that up with his gritty, impactful runs against the toughest teams of his time.\n\nCannot rate Inzamam as anything but poor man's VVS given how much he sucked against the two of the best teams of his time.\n\nSome clutch knocks?

He is a few leagues above him. Inzamam during his era was arguably the best batsman in the world along with Lara and Tendulkar.\n\nThe world has seen plenty of players like Laxman, Gambhir, Hafeez etc etc\n\nSome clutch knocks?

A player who was the backbone of his team for quite a few years. His fitness was a major obstacle for him to perform even better. But over all, a very good batsman who did very well.\n\nHow highly would you posters rate him?\n\nMy biggest issue is with the people who highlight his run outs and give the impression as if he was a lazy runner!\n\nNo, never!\n\nHe was a pretty quick runner between the wickets. His issue was that, more often than not, he was a wrong judge of a single or a double.\n\nMany at times, he couldn’t correctly calculate the timing of events to accurately assess the risk of taking a single or double. And hence tried to take a run which was never there.\n\nOther than that, he was one of those batsmen whose presence on the crease alone, was dominant and intimidating enough, not only to keep the entire opposition worried but the commentators also could not focus on anything else but Inzi.\n\nOne of the greatest of all time who had a class of his own.\n\nSo for Inzi you went with rounding off to 49 (When his average was 49.61) but for Laxman’s 45.96 you took to to 46 to show the difference is 3 and how its insignificant when in reality any difference above 45 is pretty significant in debates.\n\nTo rest your debate of position impacting VVS’ number of centuries and this its not comparable\n\nInzi played 77 innings at 5 and 6 and scored 9 100s\n\nVVS played 141 innings at 5 and 6 and scored 11 100s (Just 2 more in comparisons)\n\nSo Inzi even at no 5 and 6 was better at conversion and making 100s.\n\nAlso at the same time while defending VVS’ lack of centuries due to position you have completed ignored the fact that batting more at 5,6 he also had more opportunities to remain not out on more occasions which inflated his average a bit more.\n\nAnyways its your opinion but, doubt many neutrals would agree on your statement which you have repeated a few times as well as your conclusion.\n\nSo do you have *any* evidence the so called neutrals rating Inzamam better?\n\nVVS coming in at 5 and 6 isn't the same as Inzamam. Take a look at the batting above them, to compare and their output. Your silly and simplistic way of looking at bald averages and centuries isn't impressing anyone but your own countrymen.\n\nNpbody cares that Inzamam stayed notout against freaking B'Desh in 2000s to force a win. Everyone cares that VVS stayed not out to force a win against the still might AUS. Just one amongst his many, many iconic knocks.\n\nI just had another look. Inzamam has a freaking total of ONE century in 27 tests against AUS and SAf. Tells how absolutely poor he was against pace. Zero ability to play a substantial knock against two of the most competitive and dominant teams of his era.\n\nSo please, forgive me if I rate Inzamam as a poor man's VVS. And I am doing that only because they have more or less similar numbers. In terms of impact, VVS inhabited an entirely different galaxy compared to Inzamam.\n\nPeace."
