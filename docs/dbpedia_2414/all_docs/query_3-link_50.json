But when we are doing good, nobody cares. During the champions trophy, we won else we would have seen some conflict then as well.

I am sure he does.\n\nNo, i dont think in PSL he does anywork, but i could be wrong..\n\nAlso, to what Fakhar has said in the video, i would like to elaborate on this issue.\n\nRizwan, Babar, Shaheen, Inzamam, Haider Ali and many more players are part of that agency. Now when Sandeep had a rape case against him, the Saya Corporation company had Rizwan go to Nepal and have a photoshoot with Sandeep Lamichane, who was an alleged rapist at the time.\n\nThe reason why because Rizwan had developed a good muslim pr image, thus, they wanted Sandeep to do a photoshoot with him and be able to do positive PR for Sandeep. This was exposed on twitter by people.\n\nSo if this management company can go down to such levels, than who knows what else they could had done and what Fakhar is saying could be right that certain players might have been added in the team just so that the PR of that player can improve in getting him good gigs. The England part that Fakhar mention where they can now access the declared assets will reveal more.\n\nMajor\n\nT20I Star\n\nJoined\n\nAug 28, 2013\n\nRuns\n\n31,923\n\nPost of the Week\n\n7\n\nAfter all this, I guess he will do no more analysis.

Ary has a channel A sports and A sports gets rights of ICC broadcasting from the Main broadcaster ( which i think is Star ).\n\nEven for Pakistan matches, A sports doesnt really buy rights and if they do, they will buy the rights from PTV Or Tensports not from PCB directly.\n\nBouncerGuy\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n16,448\n\nIn my opinion, this should not be happening. If the Chief Selector and certain players share the same business manager, it could raise questions about the fairness of player selection. The concern is that the Chief Selector might favor those players with whom they have business dealings, which could compromise the integrity of the selection process. Need to get rid of this or else Pakistan cricket is doomed.\n\nSamNJ\n\nLocal Club Star\n\nJoined\n\nJan 11, 2015\n\nRuns\n\n1,876\n\nNot right in an ideal world.

This is totally in line with global business practices where athletes and their management do many projects of investments together by forming companies. Some of the famous athletes in this regard are Lebron James, Tom Brady, Venus & Serena Williams, David Beckham, Magic Johnson, etc. partnership with their agents and management companies. ChatGPT and internet can confirm this.\n\nThe statement and document being posted also shows Yazoo International, as an e-commerce, mail order company with less than 1100 pounds in assets, was established during the Covid-19 pandemic and did no business, whatsoever. Still, it was reported it in all their tax returns in Pakistan since its inception. Why would they report it in tax returns if they are hiding something under the carpet?\n\nThey also emphasised that no cricket player, whether current or former, has ever held any shares in Saya Corporation Global Sports Group. This fact is verifiable through the SECP Pakistan's data, which includes comprehensive historical records and that it extends to all their offices, both in Pakistan and in partnership with offices in the UK, South Africa, and the USA\n\nSaj\n\nPakPassion Administrator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 1, 2001\n\nRuns\n\n96,088\n\nFrom the management company:\n\nIf Saya Corporation is this powerful and has Inzamam, Babar Azam and everyone in their pocket:\n\n1. Why do Fakhar Zaman, Abrar Ahmed and Zaman Khan on the bench? They are also with Saya.\n\n2. Why did Muhammad Rizwan get dropped from the 2019 World Cup after scoring two centuries against Australia? Inzamam was chief selector at the time.\n\n3. Are they trying to imply that Babar Azam, Muhammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi are not good enough to be in the team?\n\n4. Did Saya go down when Inzamam was not the chief selector?\n\n5. If they got Pakistan players central contract approved, do they get any shares from their central contract or PSL money at all?\n\n6. Did their CEO declared Yazoo International UK in his tax returns in Pakistan from 2021 onwards? If it is declared along with its bank account how come this is the case of fraud?

Why do Fakhar Zaman, Abrar Ahmed and Zaman Khan on the bench? They are also with Saya.\n\n2. Why did Muhammad Rizwan get dropped from the 2019 World Cup after scoring two centuries against Australia? Inzamam was chief selector at the time.\n\n3. Are they trying to imply that Babar Azam, Muhammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi are not good enough to be in the team?\n\n4. Did Saya go down when Inzamam was not the chief selector?\n\n5. If they got Pakistan players central contract approved, do they get any shares from their central contract or PSL money at all?\n\n6. Did their CEO declared Yazoo International UK in his tax returns in Pakistan from 2021 onwards? If it is declared along with its bank account how come this is the case of fraud? Is doing declared investments not in line with international global practices? Some examples are of Lebron James, David Beckham, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, etc.\n\n7.

Shaheen Shah Afridi and Fakhar Zaman are also in line to go to Harvard?\n\nThe reality is that this group is educating Pakistan players and only those who have malicious agenda against Pakistan are spreading the disinformation.\n\n1. The players named on the bench gain international exposure at a global event such as the World Cup. This works for your management.\n\n2. Inzimam was the chief selector, but the management and captain at the time were far more organised. Rizwan was and is still not good enough to play against the best international sides (full strength)\n\n3. The three players have been allowed to play unchecked and unaccounted for 4 years, is the agency going to use near recent performances against low quality sides to justify the three players who have been having a free ride?\n\n4. Saya didn’t need Inzimam only, things worked out perfectly for them with Babar becoming the captain and having a full control over selection.\n\n5. I’m sure Saya most certainly do get a share of their player’s earnings all across. That’s why you represent them, it’s not a free service. The agency always takes a percentage of all earnings.\n\n6. Not sure who is investigating Saya for fraud.\n\n7. Of course other management companies are representing multiple Pakistan players, but it is your management company that is in question because the captain and chief selector are represented by you. Do not try to shift the blame elsewhere. You are in the firing line for this.\n\n8. Whoever took Babar and Rizwan to Harvard need to be investigated for wasting their money. Who has money to dispose/throw away like this?\n\nMenInG\n\nPakPassion Administrator\n\nJoined\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nRuns\n\n217,303\n\nDon't think this will end well for all concerned\n\nThis is anchorperson Mubashir Lucman with his expose:\n\nLast edited: Oct 29, 2023\n\nDeadlyVenom\n\nSenior ODI Player\n\nJoined\n\nJul 17, 2010\n\nRuns\n\n22,105\n\nPost of the Week\n\n1\n\nThis is a non issue\n\nRana\n\nHall of Famer\n\nJoined\n\nJan 18, 2006\n\nRuns\n\n66,975\n\nDon't think this will end well for all concerned\n\nThis is anchorperson Mubashir Lucman with his expose:\n\n@Major\n\nWhat do you have to say about this now?

That is a bigger issue, and I hope someone with HR experience can shed light here.\n\nRest of the stuff that some posters that hate Rizwan are trying to discuss are useless. The topic and issue is something else, but some fans are trying to take this opportunity to create sensationalism as the guy they hate has finally something to be bashed about.\n\nFrom a purely legal and technical point of view and keeping sensationalism aside, the real issue here is conflict of interest.\n\nInzi is a chief selector and he should not have any other business interests tied to any players, so he can selected deselect players purely on merit.\n\nMoreover, Inzi and his partners benefit from the success of the signatories, so it incentivizes selecting signatories.\n\nThis is very concerning that they are all in bed together. We need a chief selector who keeps a distance with players.\n\nMenInG\n\nPakPassion Administrator\n\nJoined\n\nOct 2, 2004\n\nRuns\n\n217,303\n\nNot a fan of Babar’s captaincy. But seems more like a PCB ploy in the aftermath of the team’s performance in the WC and the recent contract negotiations.

The conflict of interest is very concerning.\n\nIf Inzi leaves his post as chief selector, then this is much less of an issue\n\nemranabbas\n\nT20I Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nOct 29, 2013\n\nRuns\n\n6,437\n\nExactly.

At a time when England is handing out three-year contracts to retain players, PCB is using oppressive methods to keep players in check. If the team would’ve been winning right now, all of this would’ve been a non-issue. But right now, the PCB is taking advantage of public sentiment.\n\nIt’s completely okay to be upset with the team’s performance at this tournament, and also support players’ rights to better pay, benefits and revenue sharing. Especially considering their de-facto ban from the IPL and all its affiliated leagues around the world.\n\npersonally, I want a change in captaincy in limited overs. At the same time, this shouldn’t be the way to go about it. For the first time, we had a team which wasn’t always fighting within itself. Apparently that didn’t sit well with the constantly shifting political powers that be at the PCB. There are very few players in this team who wouldn’t have make the team just on merit, especially the players being blamed right now. If Rizwan isn’t Pakistan’s best keeper-batsman right now, I don’t know who is. Poor from the PCB. Back to their backward ways.\n\nFarabi\n\nLocal Club Regular\n\nJoined\n\nJun 11, 2019\n\nRuns\n\n1,429\n\ncan anyone tell me what is happening?\n\nInzi is a chief selector.\n\nHe is also a business partner with Rizwan and another man Talha on a marketing agency firm named Yazoo. The marketing agency has signed 9 of Pakistans main players including Nawaz, Hassan Ali, and Shadab.\n\nThis means, Inzi, Babar have financial stake in the success of nawaz, shadab, and Hassan Ali. They make money if these players do well."
