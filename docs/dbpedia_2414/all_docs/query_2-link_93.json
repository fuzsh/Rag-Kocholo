        "text": "Former skipper Inzamam was installed as the chief selector in August 2023 for a second term ahead of the Asia Cup and the World Cup. The selection committee comprised Mickey Arthur, Grant Bradburn and secretary Hasan Cheema, the former two being included after they voiced a say in selection matters before taking up coaching roles with the side.\n\nFollowing Pakistan’s poor run in the World Cup, Inzamam was embroiled in a conflict of interest debate after it emerged that he reportedly has a stake in a players’ agent’s firm ‘Yazo International Limited’, a company that is owned by Talha Rehmani.\n\nRehmani manages Pakistan’s top players including Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam and Shaheen Afridi. Rizwan is also a co-owner of the company.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Inzamam has resigned from his role, stating the reasons for his decision on Samaa TV. “The kind of allegations against me… I spoke to the board and told them that you could inquire if you doubt me in any way.\n\n“They said, Inzy Bhai, we have made a committee of five people. I said, okay if you have made a committee, I will step down till they complete the investigation so once everything is cleared, I will sit with the PCB. I was a cricketer and am ready for Pakistan always. What shocked me was that if they were inquiring something about me and this is my job, then I should step down and let them inquire without any difficulty.”\n\nThe PCB also confirmed the developments.\n\n“Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process. The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner.”"
