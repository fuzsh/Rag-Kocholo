        "text": "3) Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan)- 100Kg approx\n\nWhen it comes to being unfit, Inzamam’s name will always be taken. Despite all his achievements, the former Pakistani batsman will always be remembered for his weight issues. It is safe to say that he was the heaviest cricketer during the 2000s.\n\nInzi weighed more than 100 kgs. He had a history of being involved in the funniest run-outs in cricket. However, despite his chubby built, the Legend holds a list of records to his name and was right up there in terms of “Legendary Cricketers”\n\nInzi scored 8830 runs in Test cricket at an average of 49.33. He also scored 11739 runs in ODIs at an average of 39.53. He was hungry for not only food but also runs."
