        "text": "Pakistan is really good at making great fast bowlers. They have a secret place where they train them. Some famous fast bowlers from Pakistan are Imran Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Wasim Akram, Younis Khan, Shaheen Afridi, and Saqlain Mushtaq. They also have some amazing batsmen like Inzamam-Ul-Haq, Misbah, Javed Miandad, and Babar Azam. They’ve been dominating cricket since they started playing in 1952.\n\nLet’s take a look at the top 10 cricket legends from Pakistan:\n\n10. JAVED MIANDAD\n\nJaved Miandad did really well in the 1992 World Cup. He got 10th place on the list because he scored 437 runs, which was the most by any Pakistani player. People loved watching him play because he was good at making big scores and hitting powerful shots. He’s considered one of the best batsmen ever. In test matches, he’s the second-highest run-scorer for Pakistan with 8,832 runs, and he’s fourth in all types of cricket matches.\n\n9. MOHAMMAD YOUSUF\n\nMohammad Yousuf was a great cricket player from Pakistan, especially good at batting in the middle of the order. He did really well in both One Day International (ODI) and Test cricket. In ODIs, he scored 9,554 runs, which is the second highest for Pakistan. In 2006, he made a record by scoring 1,788 runs and 9 centuries in Test matches in just one year. Because of his amazing performance, he won the ICC Test Player of the Year award in 2007. He was so good that even famous players like Warne and McGrath found it hard to play against him. Even though he’s not playing anymore, his absence is still felt in Pakistani Test cricket team.\n\n8. YOUNIS KHAN\n\nYounis Khan is really important to Pakistan. He’s known as one of the best middle-order batters in Test cricket. He has scored a lot of runs, 10,099 to be exact, and has hit 34 centuries. He’s the only Pakistani player to reach 10,000 runs. What’s even cooler is that he’s scored a century (100 runs) against every cricket team in the world! He’s also great in T20 cricket. He helped Pakistan win their first T20 title in 2009 by being a good leader.\n\n7. SHOAIB AKHTAR\n\nThe Rawalpindi Express is one of the best bowlers in the world. He’s known for being the fastest bowler ever. In a match against England in 2003, he bowled at a record-breaking speed of 161.3 km/h, which is still the fastest in cricket history. Even though he played alongside other great bowlers like Wasim, Waqar, and Shoaib, he only took 438 wickets in all types of cricket matches for Pakistan. That puts him at 7th place in Pakistan’s list of top wicket-takers.\n\n6. SAQLAIN MUSHTAQ\n\nSaqlain Mushtaq was a really good spinner who invented a special bowling move called the ‘doosra.’ Other famous spin bowlers like Murali and Ashwin use it too, and they thank Saqlain for it. Even though Saqlain only played for 9 years, he got 496 wickets. He was the quickest to get 200 and 250 wickets in One Day Internationals (ODIs). It makes you think how many wickets he could have got if he played longer, like Murali did.\n\n5. INZAMAM-UL-HAQ\n\nInzamam, one of Pakistan’s best cricket players, became famous in 1991. He became even more well-known during the 1992 World Cup. His important 60-run score in a game against New Zealand helped Pakistan reach the finals. He scored a total of 20,541 runs in his career, making him the top run-scorer for Pakistan in one-day international matches.\n\n4. SHAHID AFRIDI\n\nAfridi, also known as “Boom Boom Afridi,” is a powerful cricket player. He’s really good at one-day and twenty20 cricket games, but not as good in Test matches. He once scored a century in just 37 balls! Afridi has taken 538 wickets and scored 11,148 runs in his career. He’s one of the best all-rounders in the world, with over 10,000 runs and 500 wickets. Afridi is definitely a legend in cricket.\n\n3. IMRAN KHAN\n\nImran Khan was a famous cricketer from Pakistan. He was inspired by Denis Lillee. Imran Khan started playing when he was only 18 years old and took 544 wickets during his career. He retired in 1987 but came back and led Pakistan to win their first World Cup in 1992. Imran also helped other players like Wasim Akram, Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Waqar Younis to become great players. His style of playing and teaching changed Pakistan’s cricket for the better.\n\n2. WAQAR YOUNIS\n\nWaqar Younis became famous in 1989 when he started playing cricket with Sachin Tendulkar. He was really good at bowling fast and making the ball swing in a tricky way. People remember him for bowling Yorkers that were hard to hit and for swinging the ball into the batsman. He teamed up with Wasim Akram, and together they were a very strong bowling pair. Waqar is still remembered as the second-best wicket-taker for Pakistan in cricket history, with an amazing total of 789 wickets.\n\n1. WASIM AKRAM\n\nPeople in Pakistan think Wasim Akram is the best at swinging a cricket ball. He’s famous everywhere for being really good at it. He took 916 wickets in his career, which is more than anyone else in Pakistan. His special skill of swinging the ball backwards and his important plays in the 1992 World Cup made him really famous. He’s considered the best fast bowler in one-day international cricket history. Many people still think he’s the best bowler in this type of cricket.\n\nREAD MORE:"
