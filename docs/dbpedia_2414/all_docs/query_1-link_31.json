        "text": "Inzamam ul-Haq still hopes to write a final line in Pakistan cricket's record book.\n\nPlaying in his 119th and last five-day test for Pakistan, against South Africa in Lahore on Wednesday, he was dismissed for 14 runs when he was caught by wicket-keeper Mark Boucher from the bowling of Jacques Kallis.\n\nIf he gets to bat in Pakistan's second innings he will need seven more runs to pass Javed Miandad's all-time record of 8,832 runs for Pakistan in tests. If he goes on to make 74, or at least 24 without being dismissed, he will also have a final career average of 50 runs per dismissal, generally regarded as the statistical threshold for a great batsman.\n\nWhat is not in doubt is that Inzamam, 37, will leave vivid memories. The most recent will probably be the least happy.\n\nIt is little more than a year since he was the captain of the first team in 130 years of test cricket to forfeit a match. His anger when Darrell Hair, an umpire Pakistan had long disliked and distrusted, accused the team of cheating when he imposed a five-run penalty for tampering with the ball at the Oval in London and Hair's inflexibility created the fiasco."
