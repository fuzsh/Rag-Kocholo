        "text": "Inzamam-ul-Haq obstructing the ball threw at stumps | Source: X.com\n\nBangladesh batter Mushfiqur Rahim faced an unexpected dismissal in a rather unconventional manner on Day 1 of the 2nd Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Wednesday, December 6. He became the first Bangladeshi cricketer to be dismissed for handling the ball.\n\nHowever, this isn't the first instance of a cricketer getting out for obstructing the field. Former Pakistan cricketer, Inzamam-ul-Haq, renowned for his explosive batting and also notorious for run-out incidents, had a similar fate in 2006 against India.\n\nIt all happened during the first ODI of the series in Peshawar. Pakistan was chasing a daunting 300+ target, and Inzamam Ul Haq, having just entered the crease, scored 16 when the incident happened. Inzamam pushed a delivery from S. Sreesanth to mid-off after stepping out of the crease.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nThings took an unexpected twist when Suresh Raina directed the ball at the stumps while Inzamam stood outside the crease. Instead of dodging, Inzamam decided to play the ball and made a contact with his bat. The Indian players made an appeal, and Simon Taufel, after consulting with the square leg umpire, declared him out."
