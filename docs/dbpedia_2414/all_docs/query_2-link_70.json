        "text": "Former Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Akhtar once said that being in the Pakistani dressing room during a losing streak was not a pleasant experience. The same sentiment seems to apply to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which has long been entangled in internal political struggles.\n\nThe recent poor performance of the Pakistan team in the ongoing World Cup has evidently started to take a toll on the management as well. In a move that did not come as a surprise to many, the chief selector of the Pakistan team, Inzamam-ul-Haq, tendered his resignation on Monday (October 30).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision was preceded by a series of allegations against Inzamam, suggesting that he held a stake in a player's management company registered with the PCB.\n\nInzamam resigned from his role as chief selector, and the PCB accepted his resignation. However, a significant conflict had brewed between Inzamam-ul-Haq and the PCB in the days leading up to his resignation, indicating an internal turmoil within the PCB.\n\nWhat\n\nThe turmoil within the PCB came to the fore with reports claiming that Inzamam had a stake in a company that manages players.\n\nAllegations surfaced that Inzamam's purported shares in the company might have influenced his player selections for the Pakistani team.\n\nThe company in question is owned by the players' agent, Talha Rehmani, who represents several Pakistani players, including Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam, and Shaheen Afridi.\n\nInzamam vehemently denied these allegations and stepped down, urging the PCB to launch an inquiry into the matter.\n\n\"People are making comments without research. I have no relation with the player agent company,\" Inzamam-ul-Haq clarified to Geo News.\n\nThe role of the player agent company\n\nThe company is primarily involved in negotiating players' contracts with the Board.\n\nHowever, the role of the agent of the company does not include lobbying for the players; rather, it focuses on securing players' roles in franchises, endorsements, and brand ambassadorships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPCB's stance\n\nThe PCB has formed a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate the conflict of interest allegations raised in the media.\n\nThe decision was announced by the Cricket Board on the microblogging website Twitter (formerly X).\n\n\"The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner,\" the board stated.\n\nInzamam's defence\n\nDuring an interview with SAMAA TV's show 'Zor ka Jor' on Monday, Haq disclosed that he had approached the PCB after the allegations surfaced and requested a thorough investigation.\n\nHe further emphasized that he had chosen to step down from his role until the committee concluded its investigation. \"Since I am facing an inquiry, and as is the nature of my job, I should step down and let them conduct the probe,\" Inzamam explained.\n\nExpressing his emotional turmoil, he stated, \"I am a human being, and it hurts. I have a 20-year-old career in cricket during which I represented Pakistan. I am not someone people don't know. When such allegations are leveled, it hurts.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fallout between Inzamam and PCB chief Zaka Ashraf\n\nInzamam ul Haq's resignation from the PCB appears to be partially influenced by his falling out with PCB chief Zaka Ashraf.\n\nThe controversy began when a private WhatsApp conversation between Babar Azam and PCB COO Salman Naseer was allegedly leaked by ARY news during a live telecast.\n\nPakistani news anchor Waseem Badami later admitted the mistake, stating that it was PCB Chief Zaka Ashraf who had not only provided the channel with the screenshot but also instructed them to broadcast it live.\n\nBadami quoted Ashraf saying, \"I am giving you this screenshot, and I am asking you to show it live on screen.\"\n\nBadami acknowledged that he should not have made the private chat public without the consent of the parties involved.\n\nPakistan cricket in a mess\n\nThe Pakistan team's disappointing performance in the World Cup 2023 has highlighted serious concerns regarding the PCB's functioning.\n\nInzamam has also been accused of favoritism, particularly for allegedly favoring his nephew, Imam ul Haq, over other players in the team.\n\nCorruption and mismanagement have long plagued the PCB due to the internal politics within the country.\n\nPCB chief Zaka Ashraf distanced himself from Pakistan's World Cup performance, stating that he had given Inzamam ul Haq and Babar Azam complete freedom in selecting the team for the World Cup.\n\nHaving lost four consecutive matches against India, Australia, Afghanistan, and South Africa, the Pakistan team's chances of reaching the semi-finals appear bleak."
