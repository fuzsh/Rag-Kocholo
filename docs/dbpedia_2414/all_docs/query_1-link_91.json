        "text": "Hai on success!\n\nAli Hai, Pakistan's most successful amateur in recent times, has now sets his sights on earning glory at the cutthroat professional circuit. TNS takes a look at his career and aspirations.\n\nBy Khalid Hussain\n\nAli Hai belongs what is perhaps one of the most successful sporting families in Pakistan. His father Saeed Hai is a legendary tennis player, having captained Pakistan in the Davis Cup besides achieving several other laurels for the country. His mother Rubina is a former national tennis champion while his siblings -- Fatima, Zia and Aliya -- have all made their mark in tennis.\n\nYousuf succumbs to disillusionment\n\nBy Dr Nauman Niaz\n\nThe scapegoat was a goat that was driven off into the wilderness as part of the ceremonies of Yorn Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in Judaism during the times of the Temple in Jerusalem. The word also refers, in modern parlance, to one who is blamed for misfortunes, often as a way of distracting attention from the real causes-in PCB's latest self-defence and self-effacing tactics, their new victim is Mohammad Yousuf, Pakistan's last iconic batsman, a wielder of the bat who could rest his claims to be on the list including Hanif Mohammad, Saeed Ahmad, Mushtaq Mohammad, Zaheer Abbas, Asif Iqbal, Javed Miandad, Salim Malik and Inzamam-ul-Haq; Yousuf was presumably Pakistan's last of the Mohicans. With him ends a lineage that could compete with world's elite and how coarsely and chaotically he has been dismantled by people who have been complete embarrassment for the Pakistani game.\n\nAsia yearns for World Cup glory\n\nAs the World Cup draws nearer, and with the excitement building up all across the world, Asia's participating nations at the finals too are hoping for a performance that would make them a part of the showpiece's glorious history\n\nBy Umaid Wasim\n\nIf you add up the viewership in each of its editions, it is the biggest sporting tournament in the World with even the Olympic Games coming a distant second. And as the FIFA World Cup 2010 comes closer, and with hosts South Africa finalising preparations for the showpiece, it promises to be a real spectacle. With the World Cup coming to Africa for the first time, Asian teams would be hoping for a role reversal -- similar to that of Senegal in the 2002 edition.\n\nJohann Koss and Imran Khan\n\nBy Aamir Bilal\n\nSports history is full of great athletes, who won laurels for themselves and their countries, and are worshiped as heroes and idols by sports crazy fans throughout the world. Stardom is an addiction, but it's a harsh reality that life of athlete is short and intense. New sport heroes are born in every mega event and old ones, fade away in the dust of time. Yet few are remembered in the annals of history as great ones, who not only achieved personal brilliance in sport but managed to leave behind a legacy that continues to change the lives of many for a better cause. Johann Olav Koss and Imran Khan are two such brilliant athletes of their time who have great fan following in respective countries and are remembered as true ambassadors of sport and goodwill around the globe.\n\nThe fall of a hero\n\nBy Khurram Mahmood\n\nIn the 1990s, Pakistan produced two world-class middle-order batsmen, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf. Both played a vital role in the Pakistan batting line-up for a long time, however, following the retirement of former skipper Inzamam after the 2007 World Cup Pakistan find themselves with only two regular dependable batsmen -- Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan.\n\nHai on success!\n\nAli Hai, Pakistan's most successful amateur in recent times, has now sets his sights on earning glory at the cutthroat professional circuit. TNS takes a look at his career and aspirations.\n\nBy Khalid Hussain\n\nAli Hai belongs what is perhaps one of the most successful sporting families in Pakistan. His father Saeed Hai is a legendary tennis player, having captained Pakistan in the Davis Cup besides achieving several other laurels for the country. His mother Rubina is a former national tennis champion while his siblings -- Fatima, Zia and Aliya -- have all made their mark in tennis.\n\nBut Ali chose golf as his career very early in his life and is currently the most successful amateur on the national golf circuit. Recently, he made headlines by winning the Bangladesh National Amateur Championship in Chittagong and then went on to clinch the national crown in Lahore in the same month.\n\nAli has clinched almost 100 tournaments at the Karachi level but more importantly he has won the Chief of Naval Staff Open four times, Sind Amateur title three times and the Sind open title on two occasions. He holds the course record at the Karachi Golf Club (63) as well as the course record at the Arabian Sea Country Club (64).\n\nAt the international level, he has represented Pakistan in major events like the World Amateur Championships in Cape Town (South Africa) and Adelaide (Australia). He has featured in the prestigious Nomura Cup in Japan and South Korea. Finshed runner-up at the Sri Lankan Amateur Championship in Kandy in 2008 and also barely missed the title at the Florida invitational and Stetson Open in the United States. Last month, he was over the moon after winning the Bangladesh crown in a thrilling manner.\n\nAli studied and played for South Carolina University as its number one for four consecutive years and made history for the institution by finishing the lowest scoring average for the year (70.33).\n\nIn an interview with 'The News on Sunday', the ambitious Ali Hai spoke about his love for golf and his hopes for the future. Here are the excerpts.\n\nTNS: Your father and most of your other family members have been associated with tennis. Why did you choose golf?\n\nAli Hai: I started off with tennis as well and won a few tournaments as well as a junior. My father had been a member of the golf club for a long time and one day I just accompanied him there and hit a few balls on the driving range. I fell in love with the game and haven't looked back since. Hence I gave up tennis for golf.\n\nTNS: When did you start playing golf?\n\nAH: I started playing the game at the age of 12.\n\nTNS: Tell us about your progress in golf?\n\nAH: As a junior I had the lowest handicap of 0. I represented Pakistan as a junior in Malaysia and Singapore when I was 13 and finished among the top-5 in both tournaments. After that I left for the USA on a full golf scholarship at South Carolina. Upon my return I have represented Pakistan in two world amateurs (Cape Town and Adelaide), two Nomura Cups (Japan and South Korea), Asian Games at Doha, the Asian Amateur in China. Apart from this I have also represented Pakistan in a number of other international tournaments.\n\nTNS: Do you think golf is a better game than tennis?\n\nAH: Golf is definitely a better game than tennis in the sense that one can play competitive golf till a very late age. The prime examples are Jack Nicklaus winning the Augusta Masters when he was 45 and Tom Watson almost winning the British Open last year at the age of 59. Also golf is a much more popular game than tennis all over the world and money wise much more lucrative.\n\nTNS: Do you think that the national golf circuit is competitive enough?\n\nAH: Definitely our golf circuit is very competitive. In the amateur section we have a few very good players who represent Pakistan internationally. In the Professional circuit we have the likes of Shabbir Iqbal and Muhammad Munir who are world class players. They played the golf World Cup last year which is a huge achievement for us.\n\nTNS: You've done well on the amateur circuit in the recent past. Have you brought any changes in your game to achieve better results?\n\nAH: No certain changes in my swing but definitely my workout regime. I have started working out and am in much better shape than before therefore even during four rounds of competitive golf I don't feel tired anymore and can concentrate much better. This can be seen in my recent results by being the only Pakistani to have won both the Pakistan and the Bangladesh titles in the same year.\n\nTNS: You recently won the Bangladesh amateur title. Tell us about that victory?\n\nAH: The tournament was played at the Bhattiary golf club in Chittagong. It is a beautiful and hilly golf course with 30 out of bounds in 18 holes. The Pakistan team was in Bangaldesh two weeks prior to this for the SAF Games where we did not do to well. Everything was dominated by the Bengali golfers. All medals were won by them therefore to beat them there this time was a feat in itself. I was six behind the leader in the last round after the first three holes but I never lost confidence in myself. By the grace of god my putter went hot and I made seven birdies after that, six in the last 11 holes and shot a 69 (3 under par). Also for the past decade all champions of this championship have been Bengalis and therefore the victory was much sweeter. Our manager Major Arshad also had confidence in me from the start of the tournament and always encouraged me which really motivated me.\n\nTNS: Do have any plans to turn pro? Are you serious to pursue a career in professional golf?\n\nAH: I would like to turn pro by the end of the year and play on the Indian circuit and then move on to the Asian tour which is very lucrative. I am very serious about being a professional as I have devoted my life towards golf.\n\nTNS: Not many Pakistani pros have done well at the international circuit. Do you feel confident that things will be different for you?\n\nAH: There have been Pakistanis who have done well on the international circuit. Some prominent ones are Taimur Hassan, Taimur Hussain and now Shabbir Iqbal and Munir. Things will hopefully be better for me as I have played a lot of international golf as well as golf in the USA for five years. Experience wise I am there and just need a good break and Inshaallah I will make the tour one day.\n\nTNS: How much help have you received from your father, Saeed Hai, who is a Pakistan tennis legend?\n\nAH: I have received immense help and support from my father as well as my mother who was also the ladies tennis champion of Pakistan. From the start both of them encouraged me and took me to the golf club religiously. Financial support has always been there from my father without which one cannot take up such an expensive game.\n\nTNS: Any other personalities who've helped you better your game?\n\nAH: When I was a junior our family friend Mr Amin Currimbhoy always supported me. After that till now it has been Mr Asad I A Khan who has always encouraged and motivated me. He has always been by my side through thick and thin and has done a great job in promoting golf in Sindh.\n\nTNS: Do you think golf has a future in Pakistan? What steps do you think are needed to be taken to promote the game here?\n\nAH: It definitely does as you can see there are so many golf clubs coming up all over Punjab as well as a couple in Karachi. What we lack are sponsors and financial support. If we can get a helping hand from these large companies golf will have a bright future in Pakistan. We need to promote the game at the grass roots level. We need to get more juniors and expose them to international tournaments. Also we need schools to promote golf. All over the USA schools have a golf team. I believe that Pakistan can have a bright future in international golf if players here are given proper financial support.\n\nBy Dr Nauman Niaz\n\nThe scapegoat was a goat that was driven off into the wilderness as part of the ceremonies of Yorn Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in Judaism during the times of the Temple in Jerusalem. The word also refers, in modern parlance, to one who is blamed for misfortunes, often as a way of distracting attention from the real causes-in PCB's latest self-defence and self-effacing tactics, their new victim is Mohammad Yousuf, Pakistan's last iconic batsman, a wielder of the bat who could rest his claims to be on the list including Hanif Mohammad, Saeed Ahmad, Mushtaq Mohammad, Zaheer Abbas, Asif Iqbal, Javed Miandad, Salim Malik and Inzamam-ul-Haq; Yousuf was presumably Pakistan's last of the Mohicans. With him ends a lineage that could compete with world's elite and how coarsely and chaotically he has been dismantled by people who have been complete embarrassment for the Pakistani game.\n\nSo Yousuf's thirteen years of flirtation with cricket's big time is ending, and perhaps, regrettably, he departs the scene not with a parp, a shrug, and one eye on where his sin was at, but with all guns blazing.\n\nGiven much of what has happened since Ijaz Butt took over as chairman of the PCB in October 2008, few have been surprised that Yousuf failed to retain his status of greatness. That he failed as captain in Australia, and also not purely an angel, since he had been party to intrigues, part of the power-players and he wasn't ever bigger than the game but he was powerful as a batsman -- he explained to a Pakistani game heading to ruin exactly where it had made its wrong turns, he stitched together his vision and nine hundreds in a calendar year were not only vast in enormity but delineated the magnitude of his presence on the Pakistan team.\n\nHis cricket was filled with objectivism. He left everyone in a trance, with his swift straight and poetic cover-driving, grace in him was much more than Inzamam, a complete batsman.\n\nAs he collected 24 Test hundreds, he nailed the key to what was really glorious and inspirational about Pakistan -- this was Yousuf, the batsman of the highest pedigree.\n\nUnlike Younis Khan, he wasn't rigid and innocuous as captain, but he couldn't readily deliver a precis of his philosophy while standing meekly: objective reality. He was meek and unassuming yet power-passionate, a non-ideological captain, and most significantly he didn't have the appeal, and wasn't purely classical; and he failed comprehensively, leg-pulled, conspired into defeat, clumsy man-management, inability to thwart intriguing senior players in the rest room and also he couldn't philosophically demonstrate that to live for one's own rational self-interest, to pursue one's own goals, to use one's mind in the service of one's team and its happiness, is the noblest, the highest, the most moral of human activities speaking to the unnamed, un-championed, beating heart of his new land, and his wasn't the glory.\n\nYousuf was never a captain and why was he initially appointed depicts the heart-wrenching incapacity of the players of the PCB; it wasn't his, but it was the Board's failure. And then was enacted the 'scapegoat' phenomenon. He couldn't lead men he led his country with the bat. He knew from the beginning that the glory had as much, if not more, to do with individual creative striving as with cricket politics per se. He was the type who was in the centre of action, battled and played marvelously, a complete batsman though when Inzamam was at the roost, he was part of the politics ridden culture. Politics did matter, of course-and no one dramatized that in a career better than Younis, but he was son of a lesser God when he intended to break the power-driven mores; that wasn't his domain.\n\nYousuf, no matter failed as captain of Pakistan on an arduous tour of Australia, though he wasn't self-appointed, still the decision to ascend him to the captaincy scaffold was faceless, malign, or the just ignorant PCB's top tier lead to dire effects in the game's environment. At least thrice he was hard done by the PCB. Dropped from the line-up of the first Twenty20 Pakistan team to the World Cup in South Africa in 2007, he was disillusioned as much as a ripe strawberry dropped from a tree wasn't taken on the platter.\n\nHe defected to the ICL, the illegitimate league in India. Lacking mettle and presumably with paucity of ability to differentiate between right and wrong, he counterfeited the contract and lured into another lucrative IPL assignment, he joined them and was never called-up to represent his franchise. It was humiliating but he reflected only being an indecisive man.\n\nI would like to stand up to Ijaz Butt and ask? Why was he tested beyond his domain? Why was he wasted in a role that never belonged to him? Who is going to replace Yousuf in the Test line-up? What was the thematic idealisation in mind when Yousuf was banned for an indefinite period? What was the need to create such a fuss about Yousuf and Younis? And if they are going to represent Pakistan in England versus England and against Australia then what was the message that Butt was trying to give in to the newer generation? Who is Yousuf's replacement -- I am afraid it isn't Yawar Saeed, Wasim Bari, Zakir Khan or Butt himself?\n\nYousuf, like Inzamam, never stood up on principles and during this period, we saw real-world conformation of his notions in the grim, constrained deprivation that has been gripping Pakistan cricket through much of Butt's tenure, and on a smaller scale in the PCB where any number of dreams and lives were destroyed by eminent domain and local zoning and regulations.\n\nYousuf leaves the stage primarily due to the treatment meted out to him and also largely because of PCB's enormous idiocies -- he leaves when Pakistan cricket isn't on track, and there is a lot of bullying, commands and a huge skin off the top. That can seem abstract, especially in Pakistan Cricket.\n\nYousuf has lost it prematurely with still at least two years of Test cricket left in him, and equally short-sighted as his superiors at the PCB, he contemplates resigning and ending his career when he was required to demarcate that mental toughness, standing up to the wrong doings of the PCB, and complete faith in his abilities -- he didn't need to succumb or subjugating to the whims of the powerful. Butt is in a trance and his PCB regime couldn't really last. Yousuf should have bided his time.\n\nYousuf's resignation prior to the tour of Pakistan to England later in the year reflects that there is a common misunderstanding based on the use of the phrase 'the virtue of selfishness', his decision is by no means purely selfish in the sense that he wants only himself to retaliate, himself to be satisfied and happy -- at what cost\n\nIntrigues if he proliferated within the Pakistan team and infighting with Younis, then Butt should have resigned being the calling shots? Why should have Yousuf been penalized? Where was the team management when there were, reportedly, people standing up to him in Australia? It was just a leaf out of cricket's constitutional mess.\n\nYousuf shouldn't be impetuous and wait for the PCB regime to change; he should have appealed against the decision and shown constrain? He should play for Pakistan in Tests whenever called upon to do so, illustrating a sense of deep compassion for decent humans are injured in the world that follows wrong premises motivated what his detractors see as horribly uncharitable contempt of people who could destroy the values of an ill-driven culture.\n\nAsia yearns for World Cup glory\n\nAs the World Cup draws nearer, and with the excitement building up all across the world, Asia's participating nations at the finals too are hoping for a performance that would make them a part of the showpiece's glorious history\n\nBy Umaid Wasim\n\nIf you add up the viewership in each of its editions, it is the biggest sporting tournament in the World with even the Olympic Games coming a distant second. And as the FIFA World Cup 2010 comes closer, and with hosts South Africa finalising preparations for the showpiece, it promises to be a real spectacle. With the World Cup coming to Africa for the first time, Asian teams would be hoping for a role reversal -- similar to that of Senegal in the 2002 edition.\n\nThe World Cup came to Asia for the first time in 2002 when it was co-hosted by Korea and Japan and it started with an African shock. France, the defending champions, were stunned by a Papa Bouba Diop strike as the unheralded Senegalese won the match 1-0 -- a result that in the end proved too costly for the French.\n\nThis time around, Asia's four representatives would be hoping for something of the same. Japan, North Korea (Korea DPR), South Korea (Korea Republic) and Australia will be the continent's flag-bearers. Incidentally, Australia, who last time qualified for the World Cup from the Oceania region, only recently decided to switch their alliance to the Asian zone and come under Asia's football governing body AFC as according to them there was little competition in the Oceania zone. And hence, the Aussies had to play in the AFC World Cup qualifiers.\n\nAsia's World Cup qualifying has two groups of five teams who come through to the final group phase after playoffs in which all of Asian countries participate. The top two teams from each group qualify automatically for the World Cup while the third-placed teams from each group end up in a playoff battle with the winner of that facing the winner of the Oceania qualifiers for a place in the World Cup. Bahrain faced New Zealand for a place in the 2010 showpiece and it was the Kiwis who came out on top.\n\nWith the World Cup almost two months away, here is a review of Asian teams' chances in South Africa, the players to watch out for and the big matches for them.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia are in Group D for the finals along with Germany, Ghana and Serbia. A tough group sees the Aussies face the Germans in their first match of the tournament. Germany are the favourites for the group which means there would be a three-way contest for second place. Australia face Ghana in Rustenberg on June 19 and Serbia in Nelspruit on June 23 -- matches which would be crucial to their aspirations for the World Cup.\n\nAustralia's impressive performance at the World Cup in 2006 would give them the impetus to drive forward this time around. The Soceroos lost to eventual winners Italy and that too on a controversial penalty. They topped AFC group 1 in the 2010 World Cup qualification and became one of the first nations to qualify for the finals tournament without losing a match and only conceding one goal and that too after having played Asian powehouses Japan, a rising Uzbekistan, Qatar and Bahrain.\n\nIn a squad which is comprises of mostly European-based players, Australia have a good chance of going at least to the quarters at the World Cup. And having players like Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, Galatasaray winger Harry Kewell, Everton midfielder Tim Cahill and Palermo's attacking midfielder Marc Bresciano would certainly aid the Australian ambition.\n\nJapan\n\nThe Japanese finished second to Australia in their AFC qualifying group and are paired with Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon in Group E for the finals. Netherlands and Samuel Eto'o's Cameroon are bookies favourites to progress but Japan would not be easy to roll over.\n\nThis is the fourth consecutive time that they have qualified for the World Cup and if their experience of performing at the big stage is anything to go by, they would be a force to reckon with.\n\nAfter matches against Netherlands and Cameroon, Japan face Denmark in their final game in Rustenberg on June 24 -- a match that could probably be the decider for the group.\n\nAce free-kick taker, Shunsuke Nakamura would be key to the Japanese cause. He has recently returned to the J-League after a spell in Spain with Espanyol and he carries their main attacking potent. He along with CSKA Moscow's Keisuke Honda and Catania's Takayuki Morimoto would have to be on top form if they are to carry Japan to the next round.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nCo-hosts and semifinalists eight years ago, Korea are the only Asian team ever to have made it into the semifinals of the World Cup. They topped Group 2 of AFC qualifying and were unbeaten in their eight matches with a return of four wins and four draws. Their group contained bitter rivals North Korea, Asian heavyweights Saudia Arabia and Iran as well as a resurgent United Arab Emirates.\n\nAnd having been drawn into a group that has the unpredictable Argentina, Euro 2004 champions Greece and Nigeria, the Koreans would favour their chances of progressing into the next round of the showpiece. Their clash with the Albiceleste is sandwiched in between their opening match with Greece in Port Elizabeth on June 12 and Nigeria in Durban on June 22. The 2010 finals would be their eighth appearance in the tournament and they have the artillery to pose a decent threat to the other competing nations.\n\nInspirational captain Park Ji Sung would be their main man and the Manchester United midfielder would be looking to propel the Koreans to the nest round and probably even further.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nTheir qualification from AFC group 2 came as a surprise. North Korea came out of the group behind South Korea and ahead of Saudia Arabia, Iran and UAE. They are the surprise package for the World Cup and featre in the Group of Death along with Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast. Little could be expected of them since even their qualification to the finals was a remarkable achievement. Their match against the Brazilians at Ellis Park in Johannesburg would be the highlight of their campaign. The clash is on June 15.\n\nJohann Koss and\n\nImran Khan\n\nBy Aamir Bilal\n\nSports history is full of great athletes, who won laurels for themselves and their countries, and are worshiped as heroes and idols by sports crazy fans throughout the world. Stardom is an addiction, but it's a harsh reality that life of athlete is short and intense. New sport heroes are born in every mega event and old ones, fade away in the dust of time. Yet few are remembered in the annals of history as great ones, who not only achieved personal brilliance in sport but managed to leave behind a legacy that continues to change the lives of many for a better cause. Johann Olav Koss and Imran Khan are two such brilliant athletes of their time who have great fan following in respective countries and are remembered as true ambassadors of sport and goodwill around the globe.\n\nKoss was born in 1968 and is a former speed skater from Norway, considered to be one of the best in history. He is the current assistant coach of Norway's speed skating team. He won the European all-round Championships in 1991 and finished second in the next three editions. Koss had a total of 23 World Cup wins, broke a total of eleven world records, while winning four overall World Cup titles (the 1,500m in 1990 and 1991, and the combined 5,000/10,000 m in 1991 and 1994).\n\nIn 1994, the final year of his speed skating career, Koss gained fame outside the speed skating world by winning three gold medals at the 1994 Winter Olympics in his native Norway, winning all races in new world records, two of which would remain unbeaten until the clap skate era. For his performance, he was named Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year in 1994, together with Bonnie Blair. In addition, he received the Oscar Mathisen Award three times: in 1990, 1991, and 1994.\n\nHe was declared \"One of the 100 future leaders of tomorrow\" by Time Magazine and one of \"1000 Global leaders\" by the World Economic Forum. It is for sure that in times to come someone, somewhere, in the world will smash his insurmountable records, and Johann will not be remembered as the most successful winter athlete of all time, but his great work as a leader in Sport for Development and the legacy that he leaves behind in the form of Right To Play would keep the candle burning for ever.\n\nImran Khan, the darling of Pakistani young hearts needs no introduction. A shy boy in his youth, Khan descends from Niazi Shermankhel tribe of Mianwali. His maternal family includes successful cricketers such as Javed Burki and Majid Khan. Imran was educated at Aitchison College, the Cathedral School in Lahore, and the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at Cricket. In 1972, he enrolled to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Keble College, Oxford.\n\nKhan made a lacklustre first-class cricket debut at the age of sixteen in Lahore. By the start of the 1970s, he was playing for his home teams of Lahore A (1969-70), Lahore B (1969-70), Lahore Greens (1970-71) and, eventually, Lahore (1970-71). Khan was part of Oxford University's Blues Cricket team during the 1973-75 seasons. At Worcestershire, where he played county cricket from 1971 to 1976, he was regarded as only an average medium pace bowler.\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford and finishing his tenure at Worcestershire, he returned to Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent place on his native national team starting from the 1976-77 season. Following his first Australian series, he toured the West Indies, where he met Tony Greig, who signed him up for Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. His credentials as one of the fastest bowlers of the world started to establish when he finished third in a fast bowling contest at Perth in 1978, behind Jeff Thomson and Michael Holding, but ahead of Dennis Lillee, Garth Le Roux and Andy Roberts.\n\nKhan achieved the all-rounder's triple (securing 3000 runs and 300 wickets) in 75 Tests -- second fastest record behind Ian Botham's 72. He is also established as having the second highest all-time batting average of 61.86 for a Test batsman playing at position 6 of the batting order. He played his last Test match for Pakistan in January 1992, against Sri Lanka at Faisalabad. He ended his career with 88 Test matches, 126 innings and scored 3807 runs at an average of 37.69. As a bowler, he took 362 wickets in Test cricket, which made him the first Pakistani and world's fourth bowler to do so. In ODIs, he played 175 matches and scored 3709 runs at an average of 33.41.\n\nImran Khan's high point as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.\n\nFor more than four years after retiring from cricket in 1992, Khan focussed his efforts solely on social work. By 1991, he had founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust. As the Trust's maiden endeavour, Khan established Pakistan's first and only cancer hospital, a great accomplishment indeed. Inspired by the memory of his mother who died of cancer, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, a charitable hospital with 75 percent free care, opened in Lahore on 29 December 1994. Khan currently serves as the chairman of the hospital and continues to raise funds through charity and public donations.\n\nOn 27 April 2008, Khan's brainchild, a technical college in the Mianwali District called Namal College, was inaugurated. Currently, Khan is building another cancer hospital in Karachi.\n\nOn 25 April 1996, Khan founded his own political party called the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) with a proposed slogan of \"Justice, Humanity and Self Esteem.\" Khan, who contested from 7 districts, and members of his party were universally defeated at the polls in the 1997 general elections. Khan has credited his decision to enter politics with a spiritual awakening, influenced by his conversations with a mystic from the Sufi sect of Islam that began in the last years of his cricket career. \"I never drank or smoked, but I used to do my share of partying. In my spiritual evolution there was a block,\" he explained to the American Washington Post.\n\nKhan told Britain's Daily Telegraph, \"I want Pakistan to be a welfare state and a genuine democracy with a rule of law and an independent judiciary.\"\n\nIn 2009, at International Cricket Council's centennial year celebration, Khan was one of fifty-five cricketers inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.\n\nImran Khan strongly believes that in order to bring any meaningful change in the country and society and also to mend its deep politically rooted sport and Cricket affairs, he must raise to the power corridors. He believes in top to bottom approach, but so far his efforts to achieve any worthwhile success in politics have withered.\n\nBoth Imran and Koss are blessed with fame and fortune. However the latter decided to turn his strength of sport fame, in to a mass movement of sport and play for development and helping the disadvantaged children of the world through the tool of sports.\n\nOn the contrary, Imran's cancer hospital has given relief to millions of poor and needy patients suffering from the anguish of monster called cancer. But so did the other trust hospitals like Sir Ganga Ram and Gulab Devi. In my humble opinion Imran should have dreamed beyond the immediate. He had the persona and following in Pakistan amongst the youth like Koss had in Canada, Europe, America and Africa. Had Imran thought to initiate a mass movement of sports for development in Pakistan, he would have given the greatest gift of much needed \"life skills\" to the youth of country, and opened the door of employment for millions of young Pakistanis.\n\nI am sure that had Imran realised his strength he would not only had achieved his personal goals, but could well be knocking at power corridors and brought the much needed change in the over all, as well as sports culture of Pakistan.\n\nAamir Bilal is a qualified coachsdfsports@gmail.com\n\nThe fall of a hero\n\nBy Khurram Mahmood\n\nIn the 1990s, Pakistan produced two world-class middle-order batsmen, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf. Both played a vital role in the Pakistan batting line-up for a long time, however, following the retirement of former skipper Inzamam after the 2007 World Cup Pakistan find themselves with only two regular dependable batsmen -- Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan.\n\nA dejected Yousuf announced his retirement from international cricket after receiving an indefinite ban from PCB after the disastrous tour of Australia earlier this year.\n\nYousuf's major strength was his consistency during his 12 year career.\n\nYousuf is the third highest run-getter in Pakistan Test cricket with 7431 runs after Javed Miandad (8832) and Inzamam (8829) runs while he is Pakistan's second highest scorer with 9624 runs in One-day Internationals after Inzamam's 11739 runs.\n\nIt is a surprising incident that all Pakistan's three great batsmen left the game with a heartbreaking way.\n\nMiandad announced his retirement after Pakistan lost the World Cup 1996 quarter-final against India.\n\nInzamam left the field with tears in the 2007 World Cup at the West Indies when Pakistan exited the tournament after getting unexpectedly beaten by Ireland in the first round.\n\nYousuf, 35, still has some cricket left in him.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, Yousuf is one of the most important players of the Pakistan Test and one-day squad. But he should accept that he is not a fast mover in the field and not a quick runner between the wickets who can convert singles into doubles.\n\nThe PCB should also rethink about their ban on Yousuf and Younis and should call them for the upcoming important tour of England where Pakistan will play against Australia.\n\nOn English conditions Pakistan needs some experienced players who have the skill and the experience to handle the world champions.\n\nYousuf's performance in the middle order was better than from all his countrymen. His average of 55.83 is only bettered by Greg Chappell, Jacques Kallis and Sachin Tendulkar.\n\nHe is a stylish world-class batsman. He gathers his runs through traditional, composed stroke-play. He is particularly strong driving through the covers and flicking off his legs and has shone in both versions of the game.\n\nHe secured top spot in the ICC Test batting ranking for the first time in his career in 2007 ousting his compatriot Younis from the top position in the rankings. It was the first time that two Pakistani batsmen -ñ Yousuf and Younis -ñ held the top two positions.\n\nYousuf is the only Pakistan batsman to cross the 900-point mark in the ICC points system. Yousuf is also the second in the list of Pakistani batsman with most centuries with 24 hundreds. Inzamam is ahead of him with 25 centuries.\n\nYousuf was also named international cricket's Test Player of the Year at the ICC Awards in Johannesburg in 2007. It was the first time that any Pakistani player won this award.\n\nDuring August 9, 2006 to August 8, 2007 Yousuf played six Tests in which he scored 944 runs at an average of 94.40 with the help of five hundreds and two fifties.\n\n2006 has been the most memorable year in the career of Yousuf. After scoring 124 runs in the second innings of the third Test at Karachi, his tally went up to 1788 runs for the calendar year as he surpassed Sir Vivian Richards' 30-year-old record of 1710 runs in the year 1976.\n\nA record ninth century in 2006 was also his fifth in successive matches and he became only the third batsman to put up a streak of five hundreds in successive Tests after Don Bradman, with six, and Jacques Kallis with five.\n\nkhurrams87@yahoo.com"
