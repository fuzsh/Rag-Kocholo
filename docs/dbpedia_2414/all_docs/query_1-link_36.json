        "text": "Sport in Pakistan is a significant part of Pakistani culture. Cricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan.[1] Football has also gained popularity in recent years, and is the second most popular sport in the country.[2][3] Field hockey is the national sport, and was popular for several decades, with some of Pakistan's greatest sporting accomplishments having taken place in this sport, along with squash.[4] Polo and traditional sports like kabaddi and other well-known games are also played.[1]\n\nIn cricket, the country has had an array of success in the sport over the years, and has the distinct achievement of having won each of the major ICC international cricket tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20, and ICC Champions Trophy;[5] as well as the ICC Test Championship.[6] The Pakistan Super League ranks among the top T20 leagues globally.[7]\n\nFootball in Pakistan is as old as the country itself. Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief.[8] The highest football division in Pakistan is the Pakistan Premier League. Pakistan is known as one of the best manufacturers of the official FIFA World Cup ball.[9][10]\n\nIn field hockey, Pakistan is one of the most successful national teams with a record four Hockey World Cup wins, eight Asian Games gold medals, three gold medals in the Olympic Games, and the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy, with three championships.[1][11][12]\n\nSquash player Jahangir Khan is widely regarded as the greatest squash player of all time, followed by Jansher Khan.[13][14][15][16] From 1981 to 1986, Jahangir was unbeaten and during that time won 555 consecutive matches – the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sport as recorded by Guinness World Records.[17][18]\n\nIn Northern Pakistan, the annual Shandur Polo Festival at Shandur Top is an international event attended by enthusiasts from all over the world.[19] The Shandur polo ground at Shandur Pass is the world's highest, at approximately 3,734 metres (12,251 ft).[20]\n\nPakistan's sporting prowess has declined sharply in recent years, while cricket remains widely popular, other sports have suffered due to neglect from both the government and sporting authorities.[21][22][23][24][25] The corporatization of sports in Pakistan has led to a lack of investment in nurturing talented athletes and providing adequate facilities and training.[26] Government patronage and funding for sports are at an all-time low, resulting in outdated equipment, obsolete training methods, and dilapidated sports infrastructure.[27] The focus on cricket has overshadowed other sports, exacerbating the decline across various disciplines.[28][29]\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board was established in 1962 as a corporate body to promote and develop uniform standards of competition in sports in Pakistan, and regulating and controlling sports in Pakistan on a national basis. The Pakistan Sports Board is supported by the Pakistan Sports Trust, which assists hard-up players and associations so they can continue participating in sports in the Olympic Games, Asian Games, World Games, and Commonwealth Games.\n\nNational participation\n\n[edit]\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, had a great love for the sport and fully realized the vital role it played in the development of nations and the inculcation of discipline among the masses. In a meeting with the Organizing Committee of the First Pakistan Olympic Games held at Karachi, Jinnah told the first President of the Pakistan Olympic Association, Ahmed E.H.:\n\nDedicate yourself to sports promotion, for when you and I are gone, leadership will go into the hands of Youth, and Youth is our wealth, a raw material, that must be hammered into shape, into burnished steel to strive and smite in defense – the defense of the integrity and solidarity of Pakistan – the defense of the ideology of Pakistan.\n\nThe first National Games were held at Polo Ground, Karachi from 23 to 25 April 1948. Sportsmen and officials from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and all the integrated Provincial units of West Pakistan took part in these games. The total number of athletes was 140. No competitors were, however, invited from any foreign country. Competitions were held in basketball, boxing, cycling, track and field, volleyball, weightlifting, and wrestling.\n\nOver the years, Pakistan has been held back due to the lack of funds placed in sports. Many facilities are substandard, causing Pakistan to fall behind other nations. In its early years, the young state had been able to compete with much success, but during the late 1970s, with the government no longer investing in athletics, the country could no longer compete.\n\nHowever, since the late 1990s, this trend has changed. Money is now being placed into sports, and many of the federations are now managed by people who are trying to push Pakistani sportsmen and -women forward. International tournaments are now hosted in the country, and the nation sends athletes to compete abroad. There has also been a restructuring of national tournaments, and new facilities and equipment are being provided. This has seen overall results improve.\n\nOn March 3, 2009, 12 militants with guns, grenades, and rocket launchers attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka national cricket team to a match at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan. Six Pakistani policemen escorting the team and two civilians were killed while seven Sri Lankan players and an assistant coach were injured. Since the terrorist attacks, no foreign cricket teams toured Pakistan until 2015 when Zimbabwe toured for an away series. A month after the attack on the Sri Lankan team, the International Cricket Council relieved Pakistan of co-hosting duty for any 2011 Cricket World Cup games. Pakistan has tried to make the best of the situation by offering to host its \"home\" matches on neutral territory in the United Arab Emirates.[30] However, due to a decrease in terrorism in Pakistan over the past few years, as well as an increase in security, many teams have toured Pakistan since 2015.[31] These teams include Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh, South Africa, Australia and an ICC World XI team. In addition, the Pakistan Super League has seen games hosted in Pakistan.[32][33][34][35][36]\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board is a government institution whereas the Pakistan Olympic Association is working under the shelter of the International Olympic Committee. Due to government interference, the Pakistan Olympic Association is very close to getting a ban from participation in the Olympic Games. Due to the Cold War, Pakistani sports is also suffering but, there is no hope of resolving this problem due to government-level dictatorship. [37]\n\nTeam sports\n\n[edit]\n\nCricket\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cricket in Pakistan\n\nSee also: Pakistan Cricket Board\n\nCricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan. Pakistan has won international cricket events, which include the 1992 Cricket World Cup, the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy besides finishing as runner-up in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2022 T20 World Cup. Pakistan also won the ACC Asia Cup in 2000 and 2012 and all three versions of the Austral-Asia Cup.\n\nPakistan's cricket teams take part in domestic competitions such as the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, the Patron's Trophy, ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup, and the ABN-AMRO Champions Trophy. Pakistan Cricket Board also organize a franchise based T20 cricket league known as the Pakistan Super League.\n\nInternational Test and one-day matches are played between the Pakistan national cricket team and foreign opponents regularly. Women's cricket is also very popular, with Kiran Baluch holding the current record for the highest score in a women's test match with her innings of 242. The Pakistan Cricket Board controls both the men's and women's games. The 2020 Pakistan Super League events was hosted entirely by Pakistan.[38]\n\nNotable cricketers from Pakistan include Aaqib Javed, Ramiz Raja, Babar Azam, Shoaib Akhtar, Younis Khan, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Abdul Qadir, Wasim Akram, Zaheer Abbas, Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Yousaf, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Waqar Younis, Shahid Afridi, the Mohammad brothers (Hanif, Mushtaq, Sadiq and Wazir) and Imran Khan. Imran Khan has been named in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Saeed Anwar's 194 runs against India remained the record for most runs by a batsman in an ODI for 11 years which was broken by Fakhar Zaman's 210 against Zimbabwe in 2018. Shoaib Akhtar holds the record of delivering the fastest delivery in the history of cricket. Shahid Afridi holds numerous records i.e. the 3rd fastest century in ODIs, and the highest number of sixes in international cricket. Wasim Akram at the time of his retirement had taken the most wickets in ODIs. Muhammad Yousuf has scored the most Test runs in a calendar year.\n\nField hockey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Field hockey in Pakistan\n\nThe Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) is the national governing body of field hockey in Pakistan. The Pakistan Hockey Federation Women Wing (PHFWW) is the official organization of women's field hockey in Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistan national field hockey team has won 3 gold medals at the Olympic Games, and lifted the Hockey World Cup 4 times, being the country with most World Cups till the present. It has also won the most Asian gold medals and is the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy with 3 titles. It used to be consistently ranked among the top teams in the world. However, lately, there has been a decline in results, with the national team failing to qualify for both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. The hockey team also failed to qualify for the 2023 World Cup.[39] Also, because of the PHF's poor economy, there were two years without any international matches between 2019 and 2021. PHF secretary lamented over lack of funding could even ban Pakistan hockey team.[40] As of December 2022 the team is ranked 16th in the world.[41] Notable players include World-Record holder Waseem Ahmad, Mohammed Saqlain, and Sohail Abbas.\n\nIn May 2024, Pakistan qualified for the final of the 30th Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey 30th Sultan Azlan Shah Hockey Cup 2024 trophy 2024 trophy in Ipoh, Malaysia. [42]\n\nMain article: Football in Pakistan\n\nSee also: Pakistan Football Federation\n\nPakistan is known as the manufacturer of the official FIFA World Cup ball. The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body in Pakistan.\n\nThe origin of football in Pakistan can be traced back to the mid-nineteenth century when the game was introduced during the British Raj. British evangelist Theodore Leighton Pennell played a crucial role in introducing football to the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) in the last decade of the nineteenth century.[43] Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief.[44]\n\nIn its early years, football in Pakistan was mainly concentrated to a few areas, including Balochistan and the locality of Lyari.[45] From 1948 to 2003, the National Football Championship was held in Pakistan. After 2003, it was replaced by the Pakistan Premier League. However, due to the lack of professional football clubs, football was mainly held on amateur basis. As the global popularity of football surged, the sport’s standing in Pakistan deteriorated. Some of the reasons for this decline was the administration’s lack of attention to football and the departmental system running in Pakistan, which was abolished in other countries after the 1960s.[45] The Pakistan Football Federation also faced several bans by FIFA during the years.[45] Nonetheless, the sport gained popularity in the 21th century.[2][3][45]\n\nThe Pakistan National Football Challenge Cup is the national \"knockout\" cup competition in Pakistani football, run by the Pakistan Football Federation. The Pakistan National Women's Football Championship is the annual women's championship.\n\nAustralian rules football was established in Pakistan in 2014 with support from the Australian High Commission.[46] The governing body is the Australian Rules Football Federation of Pakistan.\n\nTeams were established in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Multan, and Gujranwala.[46] It is currently strongest in the Swat Valley, where a large competition operates and draws large enthusiastic crowds. A women's team was formed in 2017. A major national tournament was organized in 2018.[47] Australia sent a coach to assist Pakistan in 2019 however the sport's rapid growth in popularity was greatly outpacing local officials ability to support it.[48] 10 of Pakistan's more than 15 clubs contested the 2021 AFL Pakistan National Championships in Islamabad.[49]\n\nPakistan sent a team to the Asian Championship in 2022, however met some roadblocks to participation due to funding.[50] Despite challenges sending a team, it won the Division 3 title.[51] In 2022 AFL Asia reported that Pakistan was the largest and fastest growing nation for the sport in Asia with over 5,000 players with a 45% annual increase in participation.[52] The Pakistan national side are known as the Dragoons.\n\nBall hockey\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Pakistan national ball hockey team is primarily composed of Canadian Pakistanis, born in Canada or with links to that nation. The sport is growing in the South Asian community there. Pakistan competed for the first time at the World Championships in 2009. They finished 3rd out of 4 in Group B behind only Bermuda and ice hockey giants Finland, and ahead of Cayman Islands. In the next world championships, they also participated and were champions of their group after defeating France in extra time. The Pakistan national ball hockey team is developing and improving, and in 2013 were awarded Pool A status, competing for gold in St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nBaseball\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pakistan national baseball team\n\nPakistan Federation Baseball has hosted the Asian Baseball Cup several times,[53] with the national team also winning the tournament in several editions.[54][55] The team won the first SAARC Baseball Championship in 2011.[56] The team qualified for the World Baseball Classic qualifier round for the first time where they lost 0–10 against Brazil and 0–14 while competing against Great Britain in 2016.[57]\n\nBasketball\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Pakistan national basketball team\n\nBasketball was introduced to Pakistan around 1900 and is especially popular in Lahore and Karachi. The Pakistan Basketball Federation has been part of FIBA since 1958. Six teams play in the Pakistan first division. The National Women's Basketball Championship is the Women's Basketball tournament.\n\nHandball\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Pakistan Handball Federation\n\nHandball was first played in 1984 in an exhibition event, and was taken up by the Pakistan Olympic Association. The Pakistan Handball Federation is a member of the Asia Handball Federation.\n\nThe Pakistan men's national handball team is one of the most successful handball team of South Asia, winning 2 gold and 1 silver medal at the South Asian Games. Pakistan won gold in the 2010 and 2019 edition of the South Asian Games beating India by 37–31 and 30–29 respectively.[58][59] In the 2016 edition, Pakistan unfortunately lost to the hosts India, score being 32–31.[60]\n\nBeach Handball\n\n[edit]\n\nIn beach handball, Pakistan has won the Asian Championship in 2007 and Asian Beach Games in 2008.

Pakistan applied for membership but the congress postponed it until it had a better structure. However, Pakistan has deep roots in ice hockey in the northern parts of Gilgit-Baltistan province.[61]\n\nThe first hockey game in Pakistan took place in December 2018 in Naltar between the Pakistan Air Force and Gilgit Scouts.[61] Baltistan Ice Hockey Championship 2022 was held in Skardu on January 25-26, with teams named after glaciers, to raise awareness about climate change.[62][63]\n\nRugby union\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rugby union in Pakistan\n\nThe Pakistan Rugby Union was formally established in 2000 and gained memberships with the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2000. In 2003, Pakistan fielded a national team for the first time, participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka. In November 2004, it participated in the 19th Asian Championship in Hong Kong. The Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the International Rugby Board (IRB).\n\nThere are three major clubs in Pakistan, which include Islamabad Rugby Football Club (IRFC) also known as the \"JINNS\", Lahore Rugby Football Club (LRFC), and Karachi Rugby Football Club (KRFC).\n\nThe latest landmark for Pakistan rugby is that universities like Lahore University of Management and Sciences (LUMS) and Bahria University Islamabad have formed teams as well.[64]\n\nVolleyball\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Pakistan Volleyball Federation\n\nVolleyball enjoys huge popularity in small towns and villages across Pakistan, particularly in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[65][66] Most players of the Pakistani volleyball team hail from this region.[65]\n\nThe team is ranked within the top 50 volleyball nations by FIVB and has won two Central Asian titles, and a bronze medal at the 1962 Asian Games.[67] Pakistan Volleyball Federation is the governing body of Volleyball in Pakistan.\n\nEquestrian sports\n\n[edit]\n\nEquestrianism had traditionally been limited to the upper-echelon of Pakistani society up until the end of the 20th century. This resulted in private sponsorship and government funding (PST) for the sport. Pakistan Eventing was launched in July 2005 in partnership with The Equestrian & Tent Pegging Federation of Pakistan in an attempt to qualify Pakistan for its first Olympic equestrian qualification.\n\nPolo\n\n[edit]\n\nPolo is believed to have originated in Persia, and continues to be an important sport within the country with several large annual competitions.\n\nThe annual Shandur Polo Festival at Shandur Top in Chitral District is an international event attended by enthusiasts from all over the world.[19] The Shandur polo ground at Shandur Pass is the world's highest, at approximately 3,734 metres (12,251 ft).[20] The governing body of polo in Pakistan is the Pakistan Polo Association.
