        "text": "Pakistan have won two and lost four of their first six matches of the tournament, leaving them with an outside but unlikely chance of qualifying for the semi-finals.\n\nAnd the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Monday that Inzamam has stepped down from his role with the team pending an internal investigation.\n\n\"I am stepping down from the post to offer the PCB the opportunity to conduct a transparent inquiry about the conflict of interest allegations raised in the media. If the committee finds me not guilty, I will resume my role as the chief selector.\"\n\nThe legendary Pakistan captain and batter was previously the men’s chief selector between 2016 and 2019, and returned to his role ahead of the Asia Cup earlier this year.\n\nIn his previous tenure as the chief selector, Pakistan won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy by beating arch-rivals India by 180 runs at The Oval. He also picked the squad that won five out of the nine league games at the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England and Wales but failed to make it to the knock-out stage.\n\n“It's really unfair to start a witch hunt, certainly on Babar Azam, on Inzi, on our coaches, on the management team,” Arthur said.\n\n“What I do know is the boys have tried and the effort of the coaching staff, the effort of the players has been first-class. If they would see the amount of effort that the players and staff put in, they would be amazed.”"
