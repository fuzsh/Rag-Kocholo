        "text": "Pakistani batting maestro Inzamam-ul-Haq has ignited a new controversy by accusing Team India of tampering with the ball during their T20 World Cup Super 8 match against Australia on Monday, June 24. Inzamam made this statement after India’s decisive 24-run triumph over Australia at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St. Lucia.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain’s allegations center on the unusual reverse swing left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh was getting in his second spell in the 16th over of Australia’s Inning. Inzamam stated that reverse swing typically occurs with an older ball and questioned how the Indian bowlers managed to achieve it with a ball that remains relatively new for the duration of an innings in a T20 game.\n\n“When Arshdeep Singh was bowling the 15th over (16th), he was getting reverse swing. With a (relatively) new ball, is it too early to reverse swing? Was the ball ready for reverse swing by the 12th or 13th over? Because when he came to bowl, the ball started reversing. Umpires ko aankhein khuli rakhni chahiye (the umpires should keep their eyes open),” Inzamam said while talking on a Pakistani TV channel.\n\nIn their match against Australia, India posted a formidable total of 205-5 in their 20 overs, thanks to captain Rohit Sharma‘s blistering 92 off 41 balls and Suryakumar Yadav‘s rapid 31. India’s innings was further strengthened by the contributions of Hardik Pandya (27 not out) and Shivam Dube (28).\n\nIn answer to this, Australia managed just 181-7 in their 20 overs. Travis Head top-scored with 76. The Indian bowlers held the Australian batsmen in check, especially Arshdeep (3-37) and Kuldeep Yadav (2-24)."
