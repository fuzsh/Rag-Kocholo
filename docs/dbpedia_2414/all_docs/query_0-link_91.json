        "text": "Pakistan had failed to make it to the semifinal of the ODI World Cup 2023. Inzamam ul Haq was the chairman of the selection committee that formed the squad for the tournament.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nFormer Pakistan skipper Inzamam ul Haq put the blame on their national cricket board's outgoing top boss Zaka Ashraf for their disappointing performance in the ICC Men's ODI World Cup in 2023 in India. Zaka declared his resignation as the Chairman and a member of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after being named as the head of an Interim Management Committee to run the affairs of the body in July.\n\nInzamam, was in fact, removed after the end of the tournament on allegations of 'Conflict of Interest' that he is managed by the same UK-based management firm that also looks after business interests of some of the active players.\n\nTroubled mindset of players in World Cup\n\n\"Can you imagine the mindset of the players when during an important event like the World Cup in India they hear that the PCB Chairman is saying the team selected was not done by the board but by the captain and chief selector only,\" Inzamam said on a Pakistani television channel.\n\nInzamam was referring to a press release issued by PCB at Zaka's behest after Pakistan lost few games in World Cup, completely disowning any responsibility about the selected team along with hints that skipper Babar Azam will be sacked after the tournament.\n\nAlso Read: BCCI Awards: Gill named Cricketer of the Year, Shastri honoured with Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n\"Just think what must be going through the players mind when they hear that an inquiry committee has been formed against the chief selector and he has resigned,\" he said.\n\n\"Where does this happen?,\" the normally cool Inzamam thundered.\n\n\"Still waiting for inquiry committee report\"\n\nZaka formed an inquiry committee to look into Conflict of Interest allegations against the former skipper.\n\n\"I am still waiting for that report of the inquiry committee against me which was formed to probe whether I had committed a conflict of interest while being the chief selector,\" he said sarcastically.\n\nInzamam said everyone had a clear idea of how the PCB management was under Zaka.\n\nInzamam also felt that the PCB and Pakistan cricket shouldnâ€™t be run on an ad-hoc basis anymore.\n\n\"These changes affected the performance of the team and just imagine when they can put pressure on a world class performer like Babar Azam what would the other players be thinking. The team was struggling in the World Cup and they needed to be given full confidence but this didn't happen.\" He also expressed surprise how quickly PCB got rid of Babar and head coach Mickey Arthur hours after Pakistan's exit from World Cup.\n\n\"What does this mean? That the PCB had already decided in advance what they wanted to do? Inzamam said he still believed that the Pakistan team had good players who just needed to be given confidence.\n\n\"There is no problem with the team, they just need confidence and backing,\" Inzamam added.\n\n(With PTI inputs)\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
