        "text": "Pakistan's chief of selectors Inzamam-ul-Haq resigned from his post on Monday over allegations of a conflict of interest linked to the team's poor performance at the World Cup in India.\n\n“Inzamam-ul-Haq has resigned as the chairman of the national men's selection committee and junior selection committee. He was appointed as the chairman of the national men's committee on 7 August 2023 and was also appointed chairman of the junior men's selection committee earlier this month,” PCB said in a post on X.\n\nInzamam said: “I am stepping down from the post to offer the PCB the opportunity to conduct a transparent inquiry about the conflict of interest allegations raised in the media. If the committee finds me not guilty, I will resume my role as the chief selector.”\n\n\"Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process. The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner,\" PCB Media posted from its official handle on X.\n\nPakistan are on the verge of crashing out of the ongoing World Cup in India, having lost four of their six matches.\n\nThey face Bangladesh in Kolkata on Tuesday and not only need to win all their remaining three matches but also hope other results go in their favour in order to reach the semi-finals.\n\nHe said it was painful hearing people pass comments on his job without any evidence.\n\n\"I am a human and it hurts. I had an over 20-year cricket career during which I represented Pakistan at the highest level. I am not someone who people do not know. When such allegations are levelled, it hurts,\" Inzamaam was quoted as saying in the show, according to Dawn.\n\nInzamam played 120 Tests, 386 ODIs and a single T20I in an international career between 1991 to 2007 and was part of the team which won the 1992 World Cup."
