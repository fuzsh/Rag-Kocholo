        "text": "Inzamam-ul-Haq has described the ICC's decision to reinstate Darrell Hair to the elite umpiring list as a \"shocker\" and asked for the issue to be reviewed. Inzamam, the former Pakistan captain who has now retired from Test cricket, was given a four-match ban for misconduct for his role in the forfeited Test at the Oval in 2006.\n\nHair and fellow official Billy Doctrove penalised the Pakistan team five runs for ball-tampering on day four and Inzamam and his men consequently refused to leave their dressing room after tea in protest. Pakistan were later cleared of ball-tampering charges by an ICC review, but Hair was relieved of his international umpiring duties. Hair has now been given the go-ahead to umpire Test matches and one-day internationals after a two-day ICC board meeting in Dubai. \"It has come as a shocker to me,\" Inzamam told Indian news agency PTI. \"Especially after all that happened in the Oval Test and afterwards. What more proof is required [that] Hair was not fit to stand in international matches?\n\n\"I don't know what happened in this ICC meeting. I don't know the details but what I know is that after the Oval Test, it was clear Hair should not supervise international matches. Why that has changed is surprising to me. Our board still needs to review this issue.\"\n\nShaharyar Khan, who was president of the Pakistan Cricket Board at the time of the row, concurred with Inzamam over Hair's return. \"I just don't understand it,\" he said. \"Fifteen months ago this man was not fit for umpiring but now all of a sudden the ICC has changed its decision.\"\n\nBut England one-day captain Paul Collingwood disagrees with the viewpoint of Inzamam and Khan. \"The times Darrell has actually umpired us I thought he has done a very good job,\" said Collingwood, \"He's good to talk to on the pitch, he's very good with the players, Darrell does get the majority of the decisions right on the pitch which is what you want.\""
