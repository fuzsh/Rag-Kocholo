After playing I have not been involved in any way so this is the first time.\n\n\"I will try to make the right outcome. I want to thank the Afghanistan board for allowing me to come back for national duty. My effort and hope will be that I will be allowed to work independently.\n\nCricket\n\nStokes hits record half-century as England beat West Indies in third Test\n\n28/07/2024 at 15:26\n\n\"For the England tour, I will try and select and give the best players. The work is not easy. Let's not be hurried, lets work with patience and the results will come.\n\n\"There is no magic wand to solve all problems.
