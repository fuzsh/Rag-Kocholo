        "text": "The situation in Pakistan cricket took a turn for the worse on Monday, amidst their disappointing performance in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 in India, as chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his resignation in the middle of the tournament. This development occurred shortly after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a statement expressing support for captain Babar Azam and criticising the \"media scrutiny,\" in which Inzamam was mentioned.\n\nPakistan team faced a new low when they suffered their fourth consecutive loss in the ongoing World Cup last Friday. After a promising start with victories against the Netherlands and Sri Lanka, Pakistan faced defeats against India, Australia, Afghanistan, and South Africa. This marked the first time Pakistan had ever lost four consecutive matches in World Cup history.\n\nWith the team hoping to turn the tide and stage a miraculous comeback to secure a spot in the World Cup semifinals, they were dealt another blow with Inzamam's resignation as chief selector.\n\nHowever, this development also comes amid reports of a potential conflict of interest. Inzamam has been accused of having a stake in \"Yazo International Limited,\" a company owned by Talha Rehmani, who serves as an agent for players like Babar, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi.\n\nLater on Monday evening, after Inzamam's resignation, the PCB announced that they have formed a five-member committee to investigate the media allegations concerning the conflict of interest.\n\n‘These Kinds Of Accusations Hurt Me’\n\n\"The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner,\" the PCB statement stated.\n\nInzamam, while confirming his resignation to Cricket Pakistan, dismissed the allegations, stating that he has no connection with the mentioned company.\n\n\"People speak without research. Questions were raised about me, so I decided it was better to resign. If PCB wants to investigate me, I am available. People are talking about me without any proof, and if there is any proof, they should bring it. I have asked the PCB to do the same. I have no connection with the player agent company, and these kinds of accusations hurt me,\" he explained."
