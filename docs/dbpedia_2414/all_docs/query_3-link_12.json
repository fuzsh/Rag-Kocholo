        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan cricket captain and legendary batter Inzamam-ul-Haq was appointed as the chief selector of the national men’s selection committee for a second time on Monday, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement.\n\nHaq, widely regarded as one of the best middle-order batters to have ever played cricket, scored 8,830 runs from 120 Test matches and 11,739 runs from 378 ODIs. He served as Pakistan’s chief selector from August 2016 until July 2019. It was during his tenure as chief selector when Pakistan won the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 after beating India in the final.\n\nHaq has plenty on his plate, with his first assignment being the selection of the national men’s squad for the three-match One-Day International series against Afghanistan, set to begin from August 22 in Sri Lanka till August 26. Pakistan will then play the Men’s Asia Cup 2023, which commences from August 30 in Multan before heading to India for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in October.\n\n“Member of the 1992 World Cup winning squad and former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has been appointed as the chief selector of the national men’s selection committee,” the PCB said in a statement. It added that the committee includes Pakistan Team Director Mickey Arthur, Head Coach Grant Bradburn and Secretary Hasan Cheema.\n\n“It is an honor for me to be appointed as the chairperson of the national men’s selection committee,” Haq said. “We had famous victories with the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 being the highlight, but my most important achievement is that around 70 to 80 percent of the cricketers – selected back then – form the core of today’s sides.”\n\nHaq said he would have his work cut out for him with the Asia Cup and the 50-over ODI World Cup just around the corner.\n\n“But, I know I can deliver in this role and I will try to do better than I did the last time,” he said. “Despite the paucity of time, we will announce the best possible sides.”\n\nThe PCB announced Haq had withdrawn from a high-profile Cricket Technical Committee (CTC) constituted by the board on August 2, which included former captains Mohammad Hafeez and Misbah-ul-Haq as well. Misbah was nominated as the head of the committee, which has been tasked with providing recommendations on cricket-related matters, including, but not limited to the overall domestic structure, scheduling, playing conditions, and appointment of the national selection committees, and coaches."
