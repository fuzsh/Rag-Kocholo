        "text": "The result provided a fitting end to the glittering career of captain Inzamam-ul-Haq who was retiring from one-day internationals after this match.\n\nTwo defeats before this had ensured the 1992 champions' early elimination from the tournament.\n\nPakistan lost the toss and scored 349 in their 50 overs. Zimbabwe replied with 99 all out after being handed a revised target of 193 in just 20 overs following a two-and-a-half-hour rain delay.\n\nCricket\n\nLift stops play - Boxing Day Test held up after umpire gets stuck in an elevator\n\n28/12/2023 at 08:42\n\nThe result means that Zimbabwe were also eliminated from the tournament after Pakistan crashed out on Saturday. Hosts West Indies and debutants Ireland meet on Friday and both also progress to the Super Eights stage.\n\nIn an emotion-filled morning, after a one-minute silence following the death of coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday and then a guard of honour send-off for Inzamam, Nazir dominated.\n\nHis 121-ball innings included 14 boundaries and a joint World Cup record eight sixes. Only Australia captain Ricky Ponting has scored as many at a World Cup, in the 2003 final.\n\nNazir was by far the mainstay of Pakistan's innings with the next highest scorer Inzamam with 37 in his final innings in a one-day international and as captain. Inzamam left the field in tears after being saluted by both teams.\n\nThe 25-year-old Nazir was fortunate to survive when he was on 31 after Gary Brent trapped him on the crease and television replays suggested he should have been lbw.\n\nHe also skied Brent to deep backward square leg when on 81 but Friday Kasteni dropped a straightforward catch and Nazir picked up a single. But he deserved his luck with some exhilarating stroke play.\n\nWhen past three figures Nazir crashed left-arm spinner Sean Williams for six over midwicket and then showed enough composure to dab the next ball to the vacant third man boundary for four.\n\nNazir's previous highest score was 105 not out, his only other one-day century, also made against Zimbabwe seven years ago. Pakistan's total was also the eighth-highest in World Cups.\n\nZimbabwe were never in the game, either side of the rain break. They were 30-3 before the rain came and soon capitulated when given their arduous revised target.\n\nAll-rounder Elton Chigumbura's innings of 27 from 11 balls, including four sixes of which three in a row were hit off Danish Kaneria, was the highlight.\n\nKaneria finished with figures of 2-48 from four overs, while Shahid Afridi claimed 3-20 in his first match back after a four-game ICC ban for prodding a spectator with his bat in South Africa.\n\nMohammad Yousuf bowled the final over and took his first international wicket with his opening ball. Fittingly, Inzamam took the catch to close the game.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nEngland sign off World Cup campaign with win over Pakistan, Australia beat Bangladesh\n\n11/11/2023 at 18:26\n\nWorld Cup\n\nPakistan keep semi-final hopes alive by eliminating Bangladesh\n\n31/10/2023 at 16:11"
