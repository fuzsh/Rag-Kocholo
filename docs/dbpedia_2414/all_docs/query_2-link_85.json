        "text": "Sachin Tendulkar is the kind of a man who left such an impact on the cricketing world through his 24-year-long career of playing the game at its highest level that he will be recognised as the ‘God of Cricket’ forever and there is nobody in the current era, or probably even in the eras to come, who can replace him for that glorious spot.\n\nHe has no enemies, all his rivals from back in the day looked up to the brilliant cricketer and the kind of a man he was and continues to be. Be it England, Australia or our neighbouring arch rivals in Pakistan, against whom Tendulkar has had numerous praise-worthy innings, people despised bowling to the master blaster but cherished watching him create magic with his bat.\n\nOn February 24, the world celebrated the 10th anniversary of Tendulkar’s unbelievable knock against the South Africans in Gwalior during which he became the first batsman in international cricket to smash a double century in One-Day Internationals.\n\nReliving the moment on the internet, some of the biggest stars came forward to congratulate him for this wonderful achievement which continues to be one of the most difficult feats to chase.\n\nHowever, there is one man, a legend of his own, whose words left a lasting impact on all the Tendulkar fans for a variety of reasons - former Pakistan captain, Inzamam-Ul-Haq.\n\nIn what can be considered the ultimate tribute to the Indian legend, Inzamam shared a video on YouTube in which he spoke about the his greatness at the crease at length:\n\n\"I will talk about one player who was born to play cricket. I always had this feeling that he and cricket were made for each other. I am talking about ever-great Sachin Tendulkar,\" Inzamam said in a video on his YouTube channel.\n\n\"What surprises me the most is Sachin came in at a tender age of 16-17 years and played cricket at the international level and gave such incredible performances over the years which is only possible if the player is an extraordinary talent. In fact, if there is anything above extraordinary Sachin Tendular is that player,\" he added.\n\nRemembering Sachin’s first tour to Pakistan, Inzamam spoke about the challenge he took to smash leggie Abdul Qadir for a four and a six in a single over.\n\n\"It's easier said than done. It was his first international tour and he faced great bowling attack comprising Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Imran Khan, among others, and left everyone shocked with his batting skills, especially considering he was so young,\" said the former Pakistan skipper.\n\n\"He played in the same era as me and in our era nobody used to think about scoring so many runs. Most batsmen used to end their career after scoring 8,000-8,500 runs. Before Sachin, only great Sunil Gavaskar had scored 10 thousand runs and everybody but Sachin thought it will remain invincible. Now I'm waiting to see who will break Sachin's outstanding milestones,\" said Inzamam.\n\n\"I have never seen more fan following of a cricketer than Sachin's. He had fans all around the world. Every time he used to come out to bat he used to be under tremendous amount of pressure to score runs but that didn't keep him from scoring runs.\n\nHe was not a bowler but even then he was such a genius cricketer that he could bowl leg-spin, off-spin, medium pace. I had faced many great leg-spinners, never had troubles in reading their googlies but it was only Tendulkar who gave me troubles and got me out many times,\" he added."
