He is the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, after Younis Khan and Javed Miandad. He was described by the BBC as \"one of the most recognisable figures in cricket\" and \"one of the finest batsmen around\",[5] while former Pakistan captain Imran Khan said that he was \"as talented as Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar\".[6]\n\nInzamam made his Test debut against England at Edgbaston, Birmingham, in June 1992.[7] His first Test century came a year later against the West Indies at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua.[8] His score of 329, against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, in May 2002, is the second-highest total by a Pakistan batsman in Test cricket and the fifteenth-highest overall.[9][10] He also scored a century in his 100th Test match, becoming only the fifth player to do so.[11][note 1] Inzamam made a century in each innings of the second Test match of England's tour of Pakistan in 2005–06, to become Pakistan's leading century-maker with 24 centuries, breaking Miandad's record.[12][note 2] His 119 against India during the second Test of the home series in January 2006 made him the tenth player to score 25 or more centuries in Test cricket.[13] Inzamam scored Test centuries at 18 cricket grounds, including 13 at venues outside Pakistan.[14][15] As of January 2019, he is joint twentieth (with Virat Kohli) among players with most hundreds in Test cricket.[1]"
