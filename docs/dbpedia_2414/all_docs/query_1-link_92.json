        "text": "Inzamam has been hurt by the reaction of Pakistan's supporters\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has denied that members of his team may have been involved in match-fixing.\n\nInzamam hit back at the team's critics during a news conference in Lahore, which followed their first round exit from the Cricket World Cup.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the manner of their defeats by West Indies and Ireland in the Caribbean.\n\n\"I can assure you that there is no truth at all in such allegations,\" the 37-year-old commented.\n\n\"The loss to Ireland was the most difficult day of my life. I take all the responsibility.\"\n\nInzamam accused the Pakistan media of \"unnecessarily tarnishing\" the team's image.\n\n\"No-one knows what the team went through after the loss to Ireland. Players live in fear of what happens if we lose. The media knows only how to attack us and not support us,\" he said.\n\nIt has been a tough time for me and my family\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board has responded to the team's early elimination from the World Cup by suspending the players' central contracts - which will be replaced by performance-based deals for future series and competitions.\n\nDepsite that, PCB chairman Dr Naseem Ashraf said it was \"not the time to panic or overreact\" even though people were \"angry and disgusted\" by the team's results.\n\nA three-man performance evaluation committee of former Test players Ijaz Ahmed, Salim Altaf and Salahuddin Ahmed has been set up and will report to the board within 30 days.\n\nInzamam, meanwhile, is still hoping to continue his international career despite deciding to give up the captaincy.\n\nAlthough he has retired from one-day internationals, he wants to continue playing for the team in Test matches, although that will depend on a new selection committee which has yet to be appointed after the previous three-man panel resigned.\n\n\"I took the decision to retire from one-dayers before the World Cup. One-day cricket has become a very fast game. I am only human,\" he explained.\n\nAshraf was persuaded to stay in post by the national president\n\n\"All I wish is that my Test career ends on a happier note than my one-day career.\"\n\nYounis Khan is favourite to take over but Ashraf ruled out a \"hasty decision\".\n\nAshraf said they would probably look for a replacement from within Pakistan, but continued: \"It will take some time to find a suitable man. We don't want to rush into things and regret it later.\"\n\nPakistan is to send two senior police investigators to Jamaica on Monday with a view to them helping in the hunt for Woolmer's killer.\n\n\"If we can't assist, the investigators will remain there as observers,\" Ashraf added."
