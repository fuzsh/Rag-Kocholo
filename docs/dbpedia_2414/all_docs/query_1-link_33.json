        "text": "Former Pakistan cricketer Inzamam ul Haq has responded to India captain Rohit Sharma saying that he doesn’t have to teach them about the art of reverse swing. Notably, Inzamam and Salim Malik had hinted at some foul play by the Indian bowlers during their Super 8 clash against Australia as left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh was able to reverse the ball in the 15th over of the second innings.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSharing their thoughts on the matter on a Pakistan news channel, Salim and Inzamam implied that Indian bowlers were doing something with the ball as it’s not possible for reverse swing to come into play after just 15 overs. The duo had also accused the on-field umpires of favouring India.\n\nRohit was asked to comment on the allegations in the pre-match press conference ahead of the second semi final against England. The Indian skipper stated that the dry conditions in the West Indies aid reverse swing and they need to apply their brain to understand it.\n\nHowever, Rohit’s comments didn’t go down well with both former Pakistan cricketers who took a jibe at the Indian captain with a prompt response. Inzamam said that our observations are correct as Rohit has also admitted it and he doesn’t have to teach us how reverse swing happens.\n\n“Dimag to hum zarur apna khole lenge (We will surely apply our brain). First thing is that he (Rohit) has admitted that it's happening. So it means what we observed is correct. Second thing, Rohit Sharma ko humein batane ki zarurat nahi padni chahiye ke reverse swing kis tarah hota hai, kitni dhoop mei hota hai, kis pitch pe hota hai. Jo sikhane wale hain unko nahi yeh cheez sikhaya karte (there is no need for Rohit to tell us how reverse swing happens, under how much sun, on what pitch; you don't teach something to someone who actually taught it to the world),\" said Inzamam on a Pakistan news channel.\n\nT20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats\n\n\"The reporter asked the wrong question. I gave a suggestion to the umpires, to keep their eyes open because the ball is reverse-swinging in the 15th over. Still my advise to the umpires is the same, keep your eyes open as well as your mind. He (Rohit) just talked about mind, I am saying keep both eyes and mind open,\" he added.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nNotably, Pakistan bowler Haris Rauf was also able to reverse the ball against USA during their group fixture. Meanwhile, India have qualified for the semi final of the T20 World Cup 2024 after beating defending champions England by 68 runs in the second semi final. They will next take on South Africa on Saturday, June 29 at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados."
