        "text": "Congressional Membership and Appointment\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nAuthority to Advisory Commissions, Boards,\n\nJacob R. Straus\n\nand Groups\n\nSpecialist on the Congress\n\nCongress statutorily establishes a wide array of commissions, boards, and advisory\n\nbodies to provide it with assistance in meeting various legislative, investigative, and\n\nadministrative responsibilities. Some of these entities are temporary and created to serve\n\nspecific functions, such as studying a discrete policy area or performing one-time tasks. Others are permanent,\n\nserving an ongoing purpose, such as overseeing an institution or performing a regular administrative function.\n\nThe majority of these congressional bodies provide that Members of Congress, particularly the leadership, be\n\ninvolved in the appointment process. Leadership involvement generally occurs either through direct service or by\n\nappointing or recommending candidates for membership.\n\nThe choice of a particular mechanism for membership appointment may have implications for the ability of these\n\nentities to fulfill their congressional mandates. Several common approaches to membership selection exist. Each\n\nalternative schema has its advantages. For example, a commission or board composed entirely of Members might\n\npermit a high degree of congressional control, but also might not be well differentiated from internal\n\ncongressional organizations. Bodies composed mainly of qualified private citizens or executive branch appointees\n\nmay provide a broader expertise than Member-only bodies, but exist outside of congressional control.\n\nAssemblages of mixed membership could provide some of the advantages of both Member- and citizen-only\n\nappointment schemes.\n\nThis report contains a compilation of existing commissions and boards that demonstrates the range of alternative\n\nmembership-appointment structures. It includes any statutorily created advisory entity (e.g., boards, advisory\n\npanels, task forces) whose membership scheme mandates the participation of Members of Congress either as\n\npotential members or as participants in the appointment process. This report provides information on the purpose,\n\nduration, appointment structure, and term of appointment for each entity. Additionally, a series of tables provides\n\ninformation on the involvement of Members of CongressâHouse and Senate leaders, committee chairs, and\n\nranking minority membersâin the appointment process.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\nlink to page 7 link to page 7 link to page 8 link to page 8 link to page 8 link to page 9 link to page 9 link to page 10 link to page 10 link to page 11

Hundreds of statutory entities\n\nhave been created to study, advise on, coordinate, or monitor matters of particular interest to\n\nCongress. These entities vary in several dimensions, including their official designation, purpose,\n\nlifespan, membership, and membership appointment mechanisms.\n\nEntities created to study, advise on, coordinate, or monitor policy matters can have a variety of\n\nnames, including commissions, boards, advisory committees, or task forces. This report refers to\n\nall of these entities as âcongressional advisory bodies.â Sometimes these groups address a single\n\npurposeâto study a discrete policy issue or to attend to one-time or recurring administrative\n\nfunctions. Often, they have a well-defined mandate, which typically includes the submission of a\n\nfinal report with detailed findings and recommendations. Although some have a specific lifespan,\n\nothers provide ongoing support and advice (e.g., the boards of visitors for the U.S. military\n\nservice academies).\n\nThe statutory provisions creating a substantial proportion of congressional advisory bodies\n\nprovide for a particular role for Members of Congress. This can include Members serving on the\n\ncommission; choosing members; or making recommendations to an appointing authority, often\n\nthe President. This report addresses only those statutory groups whose membership involves\n\ncongressional participation in one or more of these forms. It provides selected background\n\ninformation on these groups and specific information relating to the role of Members of Congress\n\nin the appointment process.\n\nThis report includes information to inform Members of Congress of their specific appointment\n\nresponsibilities and to make them aware of their opportunities to serve as members of\n\ncongressional advisory bodies.\n\nScope\n\nThis compilation attempts to identify all current advisory bodies on which Members of Congress\n\nserve directly, or for which they make appointments or recommend potential members to another\n\nappointing authority (e.g., the President). It includes any statutorily created advisory entity (e.g.,\n\nboards, advisory panels, task forces) whose membership scheme mandates the participation of\n\nMembers of Congress, either as potential members or as participants in the appointment process.\n\nThis report omits entities created by Congress that have neither congressional membership nor\n\ncongressional involvement in the appointment process.1 Boards and commissions for which the\n\nSenate has âadvise and consentâ authority are also omitted, unless Members of Congress\n\notherwise participate in the appointment process.\n\nAlso excluded are ad-hoc commissions and advisory groups empaneled by individual\n\ncongressional committees under their general authority to procure the âtemporary servicesâ of\n\nconsultants to âmake studies and advise the committee with respect to any matter within its\n\njurisdiction,â pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Â§4301 or under chamber rules or resolutions. This report also\n\n1 See, for example, the membership appointment scheme for the Advisory Commission on Drug Free Communities (21\n\nU.S.C. Â§1543), established by P.L. 105-20 (111 Stat. 232 [1997]). The President statutorily makes all appointments to\n\nthe commission without congressional involvement.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n1\n\nlink to page 10\n\nexcludes congressional member organizations (i.e., caucuses), observer groups, or working\n\ngroups created by means other than statute.\n\nTracking the provisions of law that create congressional advisory bodies is an inherently inexact\n\nexercise. Although Congress creates many advisory bodies in easily identifiable freestanding\n\nmeasures, others are contained within the statutory language of lengthy omnibus legislation.2 It is\n\nalso sometimes difficult to determine when entities have ceased operations,3 as termination dates\n\nare not always included in the organic statute, Congress sometimes amends the entitiesâ authority\n\nto provide additional time, or termination dates might be tied to ambiguous conditions, such as\n\nthe commissionâs first meeting.\n\nMembership Composition\n\nWhen making appointments to congressional advisory bodies, Members of Congress may be\n\nempowered to act independently or in concert with other Members. Structurally, variations in the\n\nauthority of appointment officials fall within several common patterns.\n\nDirect Designation\n\nThe statutory scheme may mandate that membership of a congressional advisory body be made\n\nup in whole or in part by specifically designated Members of Congress, typically members of the\n\nHouse and Senate leadership or the chair or ranking member of specified committees.\n\nIn most such cases, leadership service is limited to bodies concerned with the internal\n\nadministrative functions of the House and Senate. For example, the Congressional Commission to\n\nAppoint the Architect of the Capitol includes\n\nâ¢ the Speaker of the House;\n\nâ¢ the minority leader of the House;\n\nâ¢ the majority and minority leaders of the Senate; and\n\nâ¢ the chairs and the ranking minority members of the Committee on House\n\nAdministration, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, the House\n\nAppropriations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee.4\n\nAppointment\n\nSelected House and Senate leaders, often with balance between the parties, may appoint\n\ncongressional advisory body members, who may or may not be Members of Congress. For\n\nappointments made by congressional leaders, the statute generally mandates that leaders from\n\nboth parties appoint commission members. Sometimes majority and minority leaders make an\n\n2 For example, provisions for the establishment of 12 separate advisory bodies were included in the text of the FY1999\n\nOmnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681 [1998]).\n\n3 In at least one instance, a commission mandated by law never formally organized. Membership selection for the\n\nCommission on State and Private Forests (16 U.S.C. Â§1601 note; P.L. 101-624; 104 Stat. 3548 [1990]) was not\n\ncompleted, apparently due to presidential reservations about the appropriateness of the appointment scheme (see\n\nâSeparation of Powersâ below).\n\n4 P.L.118-31, Â§5702 (2023); 2 U.S.C. Â§1801a.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n2\n\nequal number of appointments.5 In other instances, the majority party appoints a greater number.6\n\nIn a few cases, the majority/minority ratio of appointments to a commission varies, depending\n\nupon whether the President is of the same party as the majority in the House or the Senate.\n\nOne possible component of statutory appointment schemes for certain congressional advisory\n\nbodies is the requirement that Members of Congress serve on the panel. For example, certain\n\nbodies, such as the British American Parliamentary Group, are composed entirely of Members of\n\nCongress. In other instances, a statute may require that a certain specified number of Senators or\n\nRepresentatives be selected.7 Conversely, some statutes prohibit Members of Congress from\n\nserving.8\n\nIn instances where the statute provides for appointments by the President pro tempore of the\n\nSenate, the law specifies involvement of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate.9\n\nRecommendation\n\nSelected House and Senate leaders, again often with balance between the parties, may be\n\nauthorized to recommend members, who may or may not be Members of Congress, for\n\nappointment to a congressional advisory body. Congressional leaders may make\n\nrecommendations either in parallel or jointly, and the recommendations may be made to other\n\ncongressional leaders, such as the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate,\n\nto the President, or to a cabinet official.\n\nQualification Provisos\n\nSome statutory provisos may have the effect of limiting the degree of autonomy a Member of\n\nCongress has in appointing or making recommendations of individuals for congressional advisory\n\nbody membership. For example, the statute might specify that the appointing official select\n\nmembers who are specifically qualified by virtue of their education, knowledge, training,\n\nexperience, expertise, distinguished service, or recognized eminence in a particular field or\n\nfields.10 In other instances, appointments are expressly limited to individuals occupying specific\n\n5 See, for example, the Congressional Award Board. The majority and minority of the House and the Senate each are\n\ngiven the authority to appoint 12 members. 2 U.S.C. Â§803 (P.L. 96-114; 93 Stat. 852 [1979]).\n\n6 Under the appointment scheme for the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, for example, the majority party\n\nenjoys a three-to-two advantage in making appointments to the commission (P.L. 106-173; 114 Stat. 15 [2000]).\n\n7 For example, the law creating the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission (P.L. 107-202; 116 Stat. 739 [2002])\n\nprovided that 8 of the 15 members of the commission be appointed by congressional leaders, and that at least two\n\nSenators and two Representatives be among those selected.\n\n8 For example, the Antitrust Modernization Commission (P.L. 107-273, 116 Stat. 1856 [2002]) prohibited Members of\n\nCongress from serving on this temporary advisory committee.\n\n9 2 U.S.C. Â§199. The statute states âAny provision of law which provides that any member of a commission, board,\n\ncommittee, advisory group, or similar body is to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate shall be\n\nconstrued to require that the appointment be made-(1) upon recommendation of the Majority Leader of the Senate, if\n\nsuch provision of law specifies that the appointment is to be made on the basis of the appointeeâs affiliation with the\n\nmajority political party, (2) upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the Senate, if such provision of law\n\nspecifies that the appointment is to be made on the basis of the appointeeâs affiliation with the minority party, and (3)\n\nupon the joint recommendation of the Majority Leader of the Senate and the Minority Leader of the Senate, if such\n\nprovision of law does not specify that the appointment is to be made on the [basis of the] appointeeâs affiliation with\n\nthe majority or minority political party.â\n\n10 For example, P.L. 109-58 (119 Stat. 594 [2005]) prescribes that nominees for the United States Commission on\n\nNorth American Energy Freedom must be âknowledgeable on energy issues, including oil and gas exploration and\n\nproduction, crude oil refining, oil and gas pipelines, electricity production and transmission, coal, unconventional\n\n(continued...)\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n3\n\nfederal, state, or local government positions, representing a particular occupation, or serving as\n\nhead of a particular public or private sector institution or organization.\n\nSeparation of Powers\n\nIn many instances, the executive and legislative branches share the authority to appoint members\n\nto the entities covered in this report.11 When the President (or other executive branch official) and\n\nMembers of Congress share statutory appointment authority, questions about implementation of\n\nthe appointment scheme have sometimes prompted the President to comment on separation-of-\n\npowers issues raised under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. For example, in the\n\nsigning statement accompanying the creation of the Commission on Interoperable Data Sharing,\n\nPresident George W. Bush noted that methods of selection included in the Appointment Clause of\n\nthe Constitution include âappointment by the President with Senate consent, or by the President\n\nalone,â but not by the President âfrom a pool of persons selected by congressional leadership.â12\n\nSimilarly, in a statement accompanying the signing of legislation creating the Brown v. Board of\n\nEducation 50th Anniversary Commission,13 President Bush made it clear that he would not be\n\nbound by the Houseâs and Senateâs membership recommendations required by the statute, but\n\nwould rather âwelcome, as a matter of comity, the suggestions of the congressional leadership for\n\nthose positions.â14\n\nOrganization of the Report\n\nThis report includes information on each CRS-identified, currently functioning congressional\n\nadvisory body. The report divides commissions into two groups: temporary advisory commissions\n\n(i.e., those with a statutory end date) and permanent entities.
