The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 2:48 p.m., in room 2141, Rayburn Office Building, the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, (Chairman of the Committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Goodlatte, Coble, Smith of Texas, Bachus, King, Franks, Poe, Marino, Gowdy, Amodei, Holding, Collins, DeSantis, Conyers, Scott, Johnson, and Garcia. Staff present: (Majority), Shelley Husband, Chief of Staff & General Counsel; Allison Halataei, Parliamentarian & General Counsel; David Whitney, Counsel; Branden Ritchie, Deputy Chief of Staff & Chief Counsel; Kelsey Deterding, Clerk; (Minority) Perry Apelbaum, Minority Staff Director & Chief Counsel; Danielle Brown, Parliamentarian; Susan Jensen, Counsel. Mr. Goodlatte. The Judiciary Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. The Ranking Member has stepped out, as has the gentleman from Virginia, for two different missions. I expect them both to return, and we are grateful to have the gentleman from Florida with us, but we think we will go ahead and proceed with the hearing, and I will recognize myself for an opening statement, and then Mr. Conyers when he returns. On June 4, the President nominated three individuals to a single circuit court. These nominations, together with the recent confirmation of another, are intended to pack the D.C. Circuit to its absolute capacity of 11 authorized judgeships. Given that, first, each judgeship costs taxpayers more than a million dollars a year; second, that there are eight vacancies designated as emergencies on our nation's circuit courts and the President has not submitted a nomination for the majority of these positions; the D.C. Circuit's workload has steadily dropped over the years; and the court has six active senior judges who contribute substantially to its work; it is appropriate to ask whether filling these judgeships is the highest and best use of limited taxpayer dollars and to consider alternative explanations as to why the President has decided to pursue such an aggressive and virtually unprecedented strategy with respect to these vacancies. In announcing his nominations, the President asserted, ``If we want to ensure a fair and functioning judiciary, our courts cannot be short-staffed.'' So is this court in need of a dramatic expansion? In absolute numbers, it has the lowest number of total appeals, with 1,193. That is down more than 13 percent from 2005. Measured by the number of oral arguments heard per active judge, it dropped from 99 cases in 2003-2004 to 81 recently. In terms of signed written decisions per active judge, the court averages 17, less than one-third the national average of 58. The court clearly has the lowest caseload in the country, and we aren't even considering the work of the six senior judges on the D.C. Circuit who are estimated to do the work of three-and-a-quarter full-time active judges. If the court isn't short-staffed, why are the President and his allies so determined to fill it up? But before examining that, let's review the Keisler standard for the D.C. Circuit vacancies articulated by eight Democratic senators in a July 27, 2006 letter. At the outset they stated, ``Mr. Keisler should, under no circumstances, be considered, much less confirmed, by the Committee before we first address the very need for that judgeship and deal with the genuine judicial emergencies identified by the Judicial Conference.'' They asserted, ``by every relevant benchmark, the caseload for that circuit has only dropped'' and insisted ``before we rush to consider Mr. Keisler's nomination, we should look closely at whether there is even a need for this seat to be filled and at what expense to the taxpayer.'' What criteria did those Democratic senators endorse to measure the judicial workload? One, written decisions per active judge; two, number of appeals resolved on the merits per active judge; and three, total number of appeals filed. Since 2005, these numbers are significantly down in two out of three categories for the D.C. Circuit. In closing, they emphasized the letter reflected the unanimous request of Democratic senators. So the Keisler standard is the standard of ``all Democratic senators.'' That standard, when applied honestly and consistently, leads to one conclusion: the D.C Circuit doesn't need additional judges. So our colleagues in the other body took a firm position. Or did they? Consider one Senate Democrat's recent comments about the D.C. Circuit, who told an audience in March, ``Our strategy will be to nominate four more people for each of those vacancies.'' And, ``we will fill up the D.C. Circuit one way or another.'' That doesn't sound like he is concerned about the court's caseload. A few months later, some groups united behind this effort, complaining that a majority of the court's senior judges, who still can and do decide cases, were appointed by Republican presidents. That doesn't sound like they are concerned about the court's ability to function, either. But sadly, this isn't the first time the President and his allies have packed a circuit court with unneeded judges at a time when its workload is declining. The Fourth Circuit has actually canceled argument dates for two successive months because the court ``did not have cases needing argument on Friday in October or December.'' As recently as December 2007, there were only 10 active judges on that court. Today, there are 15. Of that number, six were nominated by the President and confirmed by the same Democratic senators who wrote so earnestly about their regard for taxpayers shortly before. The Fourth Circuit's total appeals filed are down 7 percent since 2006. Twelve judges handled the higher caseload back then. Since that time, there has been a 25 percent increase in judges. Looking at the caseload, that doesn't explain this. Maybe the President and Senate Democrats see judicial authorizations as a floor, not a ceiling. Maybe also their view is that the courts exist not merely to resolve cases and controversies but to advance their political agenda. When the Senate Majority Leader said, ``We're focusing very intently on the D.C. Circuit'' and ``We need at least one more. There's three vacancies. And that will switch the majority,'' he clearly wasn't referring to the court's needs. The campaign to politicize our courts and to specifically target the second-highest court in the land risks not merely wasting scarce public funds but something more valuable, public confidence in the judiciary's independence. The evidence is clear: this campaign has nothing to do with fair and functioning courts. It has everything to do with ideology and power politics. And the Ranking Member now being present, I will ask the gentleman from Florida if he would like to be recognized. Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just for a moment. I would like to ask for unanimous consent to submit a few things into the record. The first is a Constitutional Accountability Center letter to Chairman Coons, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, regarding caseloads and the need for judges worldwide. The second is the People for the American Way's ``The D.C. Circuit's Caseload: Countering the GOP's Hypocrisy and Distortion'' claims it is too light to justify having more than 8 of its 11 seats filled. Number three, the statement from retired Chief Judge Patricia Wald before the Senate Bankruptcy Committee. And the fourth is a statement from Timothy Tymkovich, chair of the Committee on Judicial Conference before the Senate Bankruptcy Committee of September 10, 2013. Mr. Goodlatte. The Chair thanks the gentleman. Without objection, those documents will be made a part of the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Goodlatte. We are expecting Senator Grassley, one of our four witnesses, to arrive, but his schedule is complicated, as are the House Members'. Therefore, we will proceed with the witnesses who are already present, and we will welcome Senator Grassley when he arrives. If the witnesses would all rise, we will, as is the custom of this Committee, begin by swearing in the witnesses. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you very much. Let the record reflect that the witnesses responded in the affirmative. I will now proceed by introducing first Ambassador C. Boyden Gray, former White House Counsel to President George H.W. Bush and current founding partner of the D.C.-based law firm Boyden Gray & Associates, LLP. Ambassador Gray was appointed Special Envoy for European Affairs by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in January of 2008. He was appointed as the United States Ambassador to the European Union by President George W. Bush in January of 2006. Ambassador Gray currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Counsel, the European Institute, and FreedomWorks. He received his J.D. from the University of North Carolina School of Law and his Bachelor's degree from Harvard University. We are now joined by Senator Grassley, so I will go back to the beginning and introduce him, and then come back and introduce Ms. Aron and Ms. Severino, and then we will come back to the senator for his testimony. So our first witness today is the Honorable Charles E. Grassley, senior United States Senator representing the State of Iowa for over 30 years. Senator Grassley currently serves as Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and also serves on the Finance, Agriculture, and Budget Committees. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Senator Grassley served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981, and the Iowa House of Representatives from 1969 to 1975. Senator Grassley earned his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Northern Iowa, and pursued a Ph.D. at the University of Iowa. Our third witness is Ms. Nan Aron, Founder and President of Alliance for Justice, a national association of public interest and civil rights organizations. In her role, Ms. Aron has a particular focus on the judiciary. In 1985, she founded the Judicial Selection Project through Alliance for Justice. Prior to AFJ, Ms. Aron served as an attorney for the ACLU's National Prison Project. She also taught at Georgetown and George Washington University Law Schools. Ms. Aron received her J.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Law and her B.A. from Oberlin College. And our fourth and final witness is Ms. Carrie Severino, Chief Counsel and Policy Director of the Judicial Crisis Network. In her position, Ms. Severino speaks and writes regularly on judicial issues, the Federal nomination process, and state judicial selection. She has also testified before Congress and briefed elected officials on these judicial and constitutional issues. In addition, Ms. Severino has experience as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas of the United States Supreme Court and to Judge David Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She received her J.D. cum laude from Harvard Law School and a B.S. in biology summa cum laude from Duke University. Welcome to all of you. Senator Grassley, it is particularly great to have you on this side of the Capitol, and you are welcome to give your testimony. Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. I ask that each witness summarize his or her testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help you stay within the time, there is a timing light on your table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you will have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals that the witness' 5 minutes have expired. Senator Grassley? Senator, if you don't mind, in keeping with the custom of this Committee, we have sworn in the other three witnesses before you arrived, and I neglected to do that. So if you are willing to be sworn in, as we always do with all of our witnesses in our hearings, do you swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? [Witness sworn.] Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you. Let the record indicate the witness answered in the affirmative, and now he is welcome to give his testimony. TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA, AND RANKING MEMBER, SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, and Members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity. Mr. Goodlatte. Senator, I think you may need to press that button. Senator Grassley. I have tremendous respect for the Federal judiciary. We need to preserve, protect and strengthen it. As legislators, we also have an obligation to be good stewards of the taxpayer's money. The Federal Government shouldn't expect a good result from simply throwing additional money at an issue, especially during these trying fiscal times. Fortunately, one of the best ways to strengthen the judiciary also happens to be the most cost-effective. I have been committed to reallocating judicial resources in more efficient ways for many years of the 33 years I have served on the Judiciary Committee. During the 1990's when I was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I led a multi-year effort to study the allocation of court resources, including an examination of court caseloads and the allocation of judgeships. There has been some controversy over the years regarding the D.C. Circuit, and some of that controversy has centered on the D.C. Circuit's caseload. My work on the court study ultimately led to a successful effort during the Bush Administration to remove a seat from the D.C. Circuit and reallocate to the 9th Circuit. There are two important points about that effort. First, Republicans--that is my party--worked to remove a seat from the D.C. Circuit while a Republican occupied the White House. Second, although the D.C. Circuit seat was removed immediately, the new seat in California did not take effect until January of 2009. In other words, we took away from President Bush the opportunity to make that nomination. But we did not give him the opportunity to make an additional nomination to the Ninth Circuit. Instead, we delayed that authority until a new President could make that nomination. For additional context, I would like to remind people in 2006, the other side--meaning the Democrats--argued that we should not fill any more than 10 seats on the D.C. Circuit based upon that caseload, and we have letters that will show that. So, they successfully blocked Mr. Keisler on that basis. Since that time in 2006, the caseload statistics have declined even further. They have fallen so much during the last few years that the caseload per active judge today, with 8 active judges, is nearly the same as it was back then, with 10 active judges. In fact, Chief Judge Garland, a Clinton appointee to the D.C. Circuit, recently confirmed that the caseload has continued to fall. According to Chief Judge Garland, the number of cases scheduled for oral argument per active judge has fallen steadily over the last 10 years. In 2006, there were 90 cases scheduled for oral argument per active judge. By the 2012 to 2013 term, the number had declined to 81. Moreover, other judges on the court confirm that the caseload simply doesn't merit additional judges. As one judge wrote to me, ``I do not believe the current caseload of the D.C. Circuit or, for that matter, the anticipated caseload in the near future, merits additional judgeships at this time. If any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be enough work to go around.'' That is a current judge on the court saying, and so I say again, if any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be enough work to go around. Who is in a better position to know the workload than the judges themselves? Given that it seems so clear additional judges aren't needed, why then would this President nominate not one, not two, but three more judges to this court? Why would the President make an aggressive push to confirm judges that aren't needed? Remember, these judgeships come at a cost of roughly $1 million per judge, per year, and these are lifetime appointments. So that is $1 million per year, for a lifetime appointment. Unfortunately, we know the answer. The other side hasn't been shy about the reasons. Four of the active judges on the court were appointed by Republican presidents, and four were appointed by Democrat presidents. But senior Members of the Senate majority have said they need to ``switch the majority'' on the court. So why is that? Why would they be intent upon switching the majority? Well, as one of the President's prominent allies put it, ``The President's best hope for advancing his agenda is through executive action, and that runs through the D.C. Circuit.'' And we have all heard the President pledge that if Congress doesn't act, then he will simply go around it through executive order. But, of course, that strategy works only if the D.C. Circuit rubber stamps those executive actions. So, Mr. Chairman, that is a cynical and ideologically driven approach to one of our nation's most respected courts. And it is not how we should be making decisions to spend millions of dollars on lifetime appointments. I have offered a fair solution to this problem. The Court Efficiency Act would remove one seat from the D.C. Circuit entirely, therefore saving the taxpayers money. It would then reallocate two other seats to circuits where they are needed, the Second and the Eleventh. Importantly, unlike in 2008, this legislation would take effect immediately. In practical terms, this means that President Obama would still be able to make these appointments. He simply makes them to circuits where they are, in fact, really needed. Mr. Chairman, you titled this hearing, ``Are More Federal Judges Always the Answer?'' Based upon the objective criteria that I have discussed here today, the answer to that question is clearly no. For that reason, instead of focusing on confirming judges who aren't needed, and in the process wasting millions of dollars in taxpayer money, we should be looking for smart ways to reallocate our judicial resources. So, thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley follows:] Prepared Statement of the Honorable Charles E. Grassley, a U.S. Senator from the State of Iowa, and Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Conyers, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here.

Depending on your schedule, you are welcome to stay or go, because I know you have a number of other commitments. But if you can remain to take questions, we would love to have you stay. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Mr. Goodlatte. But we will leave that to your discretion. Senator Grassley. I have to go. Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Senator. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Mr. Goodlatte. Ambassador Gray, welcome. Let me say to the other Members of the Committee, Ambassador Gray has testified before this Committee on a number of other occasions, and I had the honor of meeting with him when I led a congressional delegation to Europe, to Brussels, and met with him when he was our ambassador to the European Union. So, it is good to see you again. TESTIMONY OF C. BOYDEN GRAY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, GEORGE W. BUSH, BOYDEN GRAY & ASSOCIATES PLLC Ambassador Gray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to address this question of the D.C. Circuit. I am not going to talk about the caseload numbers that Senator Grassley just referred to. I think Carrie Severino is going to look at that more carefully. I do want to point out, though, the answer of one of the D.C. Circuit judges to a question posed in a questionnaire by Senator Grassley. ``If any more judges were added now, there wouldn't be enough work to go around.'' I think it is pretty clear that the view on our side is that this is an attempt to tilt the outcomes of this court, and that is not good for the kind of impartiality that the public is entitled to. But I wanted to devote a little bit of time and what my testimony addresses are the other ways in which adding judges when they are not needed in a way that politicizes the process undermines the collegiality which is necessary for reasoned decision-making and careful thought. Now, you may ask me for a definition of collegiality, and of course it is working through issues in a common fashion, but perhaps it might be contrasted with what happens when you don't have it, and that is what the D.C. Circuit was like when I first came to Washington. It was, as Felix Frankfurter observed, ``a collectivity of fighting cats.'' Judge Harry Edwards, who rescued--a Democratic nominee who rescued the D.C. Circuit from this collectivity of fighting cats has written that it was not uncommon when he first arrived for one of his colleagues to say, ``Can I count on your vote?'' It sort of evokes what Senator Reid said, that we need one more on the D.C. Circuit, one more from his side, as it were. I think that this is a bad thing to get back into. Judge Edwards changed the rules, worked to improve collegiality. He was very successful, and it was followed with great success by Judge Ginsberg later, Judge Sentelle now, Judge Merrick Garland. It is marked in part by a lack of en banc reviews where you have a lot of second-guessing. The D.C. Circuit discourages that because they like to think that the panels can get it right and the panels don't matter in terms of the make- up of the political appointment. Judge Edwards has written that he witnessed occasions when ideology took over and effectively destroyed collegiality because the confirmation process promoted ideological commitment. This is what I think your Committee is wise to point out should not be allowed to reassert itself after so many years of settled administrative law-making. The Federal Judicial Center has identified nine as about the limit of how big a court should be. Beyond that, you have fragmentation. You have the law of the panel rather than the law of the circuit. It is very hard as a practitioner to understand exactly how to shape behavior, how to recommend, how to advise on behavior if you have an unpredictable court, and too many judges makes for unpredictability and lack of coherence. I think that Senator Schumer I think hit the nail on the head when he said we will fill up this court in one way or another, but it is based on the premise that somehow this court, the way it has operated, has overruled or reversed or blocked the current White House more than previous White Houses, and this is just an erroneous assumption. The data show quite clearly that President Bush in his 8 years was overruled at a higher rate than Obama was in his first term, President Obama was in his first term, 16.7 percent. And this reversal rate has been pretty steady over the last two or three decades, and I don't think it is worth risking the collegiality and the reasoned decision-making that we have enjoyed. Witness Judge Tatel's very nice comments about Judge Sentelle on his retirement. The only point can be to change the end result, and that is not a permissible reason for making appointments. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Gray follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Coble [presiding]. Thank you, Ambassador Gray. Ms. Aron, you are recognized.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to address a very important topic: the ability of our Federal courts, the envy of the world, to efficiently, effectively, and fairly administer justice for the people of the United States. The Committee has posed the question, ``Are More New Judges Always the Answer?'' I am not sure I can speak to the word ``always,'' but I can say without hesitation that today, with more than 1 of 10 judgeships vacant, with caseloads rising rapidly, and with the complexity of litigation increasing, the answer to your question is yes, more judges are the answer. In fact, we strongly concur with the judgment of the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Chief Justice of the United States that additional judgeships should be created in many parts of the country in order to ensure that the Constitution's promise of justice is fulfilled. But the need for Congress to create new judgeships aside, we believe the first step in resolving the crisis in our courts is to fill all the existing district and circuit court seats. As of today, there are 91 total vacancies. Astonishingly, there are more empty judgeships now than when President Obama took office almost 5 years ago. In fact, just among the states that are home to Members of this Committee, there are a total of 66 open seats. Strikingly, 34 of those seats are considered judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, meaning these courts are so overwhelmed they cannot function properly. This crisis has real-world consequences for real people. When your constituents go to court, they face a judicial system that is overburdened, overworked, understaffed, and underfunded. Cases are delayed interminably. Decisions are rushed. Because of burgeoning criminal caseloads, which must take priority, civil actions are shoved aside. Small businesses can't get resolution to problems that tie their enterprises into knots. Contract disputes go unresolved. Individuals seeking justice for discrimination, or fraud, or disputes with banks or business or the government, are left hanging, often for years. Every American deserves his or her day in court. In the circuit courts of appeals, cases are bigger, the stakes are higher, and the consequences for all of us are more significant, and that fact is doubly true for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. There are currently three vacancies out of 11 seats on the court that is often described as the second most important court in the country. The court shouldn't be forced to do its job with 27 percent of its seats empty. It is like telling a football team they can only use eight players on Sunday, instead of 11. The court can ill-afford to have this critical component of our judicial system send less than a full team to the game. These are the facts. With the unique responsibilities to oversee the actions of Federal agencies, the D.C. Circuit handles some of the most complex, lengthy, sensitive litigation in the Federal courts. Because of this unique caseload, when there were only eight seats filled in 2003, Senator Orrin Hatch called this a crisis situation. But in addition to the special nature of its cases, the plain fact is that this court's workload has increased significantly in recent years. With only eight of 11 seats filled, the caseload is currently at 185 cases per active judge. In 2003, when John Roberts was confirmed to the Circuit, that left 111 cases per active judge. In 2005, the confirmation of Judges Brown and Griffith resulted in 119 cases per active judge. Even if all three seats were filled tomorrow, the cases per active judge would be 134. Given the stresses on the D.C. Circuit and the importance of its legal mission, we are pleased that President Obama has put forward a full slate of outstanding, well-qualified nominees. When there are vacancies on the Federal court, the president is required to nominate new judges, subject, of course, to the advice and consent of the Senate. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution is crystal clear on this matter. The President cannot ignore his constitutional obligations, and neither should the Senate. Mr. Chairman, new judges, whether those named to fill existing vacancies or those chosen to serve in entirely new seats, are indeed the answer if the question we ask is: Will justice be done in the United States of America? Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Aron follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Coble. Thank you, Ms. Aron. Ms. Severino, you are recognized. TESTIMONY OF CARRIE SEVERINO, CHIEF COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK Ms. Severino. Thank you. I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and the distinguished Members of the Committee for the opportunity to speak here today. This June, the President took the unusual step of staging a Rose Garden announcement highlighting his simultaneous nomination of three individuals to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The President portrayed the D.C. Circuit as a court in crisis. He suggested that the D.C. Circuit was short- staffed, threatening our ability to maintain a fair and functioning judiciary. But the numbers tell a different story, and it is a story that is broadly recognized by those familiar with the D.C. Circuit. They show it to be the most underworked court in the country, with a caseload that has dropped significantly over the past decade. There are many ways to measure a court's workload, but they all tell the same story in this case. The most relevant statistic, and the one that forms part of the Administrative Office of the Courts' own formula to gauge workload for determining judicial emergencies, is the number of annual filings per judge. With its current complement of eight active judges, equally balanced between Republican and Democratic nominees, the D.C. Circuit has the lowest number of new filings per judge of any circuit court. This is three to four times fewer than the busiest courts. The number of cases disposed of per judge is another metric by which to gauge workload. Once more, the D.C. Circuit is the court with the lowest numbers, and the highest numbers are three to four times as many. One can also look at the number of cases disposed of on the merits. This is an even better gauge of the type of cases that take up the most time for judges. And once again, the D.C. Circuit is dead last. Circuits, including the Eleventh Circuit, have up to five times as many cases as the D.C. Circuit. Ms. Aron has pointed to the numbers of pending cases on the Circuit. I am happy to talk more about the reason that is not a relevant statistic later, but it broadly just points to the amount of time it takes a case to work through the court, not the amount of time the court itself is spending on it but just the overall length of time. Every circuit court has a unique balance of types of cases, and the D.C. Circuit is no exception. Its role in hearing many administrative challenges means it does get more than its fair share of complicated regulatory issues, but that hardly makes up for the heavily skewed absolute numbers of cases. The average administrative law case may take longer to work through than the average criminal case, but not three to five times as long. The statistics cited previously all presume that only the eight active judges are carrying the court's caseload, but that is far from accurate. According to the Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit, the six senior judges who hear oral arguments together carry a workload equivalent to 3.25 active judges. Adding that to the eight active judges, those are the full-time equivalent of 11.25 judges serving on the D.C. Circuit currently. That is more than the number of authorized seats on that court. The judges responding to Senator Grassley indicated that those senior judges were fairly young and healthy on the average and could be expected to serve for another decade. On an anecdotal level, this all confirms my experience on the D.C. Circuit, which was that we are much less busy than my friends clerking at other circuits at the time. The President was correct about one thing in his Rose Garden speech: there are courts that are truly short-staffed and in crisis. The Administrative Office of the Courts, taking into account the number and types of cases each circuit hears, has identified eight appellate seats that constitute judicial emergencies. But the D.C. Circuit is nowhere on that list. The question, then, is: Why did the president choose to make such high-profile nominations to a court that barely has enough work to go around at a time when almost 70 percent of Federal vacancies, including 75 percent of the judicial emergencies, had no nominee? There is no neutral principle that explains his move, suggesting that the timing and manner of the three D.C. Circuit nominations was simply due to politics. The D.C. Circuit enjoys a unique role as the court that hears the lion's share of cases addressing administrative law and regulatory agencies. Its position as a check on government power puts it in the crosshairs of a president whose governing style is characterized by aggressive use of administrative agencies and an avowed desire to push the envelope to achieve his goals when he has been stymied by Congress. Key Democratic Senators have acknowledged this motivation behind the D.C. Circuit nominations. We heard references to Senator Schumer's comments about filling the D.C. Circuit up one way or another. Senator Harry Reid has also pointed to political reasons to move forward on the president's nominations to the D.C. Circuit, complaining that the court was wreaking havoc in the country. He said, ``We are focusing very intently on the D.C. Circuit. We need at least one more. There's three vacancies, we need at least one more and that will switch the majority.'' Our nation is struggling to get its financial house in order, and our judiciary is laboring in many places with a shortage of judges. This is not the time to increase the burdens on taxpayers for a court that doesn't need new judges or to divert scarce resources from where they are needed most. The D.C. Circuit has been regularly canceling hearings. We need judges where there are real judicial emergencies. Congress should instead act to shield the American people from the unnecessary financial burden of funding additional judges simply to facilitate the President's aggressive policy agenda. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Severino follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Goodlatte [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Severino. We will now begin the questioning under the 5-minute rule, and I will begin by recognizing myself. Ms. Severino, in her testimony, Ms. Aron argued that the court needs more judges because it has more pending cases than it did a decade ago. I note that in his response to Senator Grassley, Chief Judge Merrick also included a stat that shows the number of pending cases. Can you briefly explain the distinction between appeals filed per active judge, appeals pending, and appeals terminated, as well as offer your understanding of which caseload measures the Administrative Office relies upon as most accurately reflecting the workload of individual judges? Ms. Severino. Certainly. Appeals filed is obviously the number of appeals coming in per active judge, the number of appeals being filed each year, and that is the circuit actually that the Administrative Office of the Courts uses as its baseline for determining whether a judicial emergency exists. So they clearly view that as the most relevant statistic. The number of cases disposed also is a measure of how many cases are being decided. So you can see, are the judges being forced to work through more cases than another circuit. Pending cases is, I think, doesn't make a lot of sense here unless you are trying to find the one statistic in which the D.C. Circuit isn't dead last compared to the other circuits. Not that its numbers are even unusually high in terms of pending cases. It is eighth out of the twelve circuits considered. But it doesn't say anything meaningful at all about the court's caseload. Pending cases are simply those that haven't yet been terminated by the court and are making their way through the process. So we would expect a fair amount of cases simply because not every case is going to be decided within 1 year, and a court could have a large number because of true backlog reasons. If the court was short-staffed and couldn't schedule hearings, we might see that pending cases would say something about backlog. But, in fact, in this case, the D.C. Circuit is actually canceling hearings regularly. I will say it again: they are actually canceling hearings for lack of cases to be heard in oral argument. Thus, this number is clearly not pointing to the fact that the court is overburdened in getting to these cases. There are a lot of other reasons that I think explain the pending cases number better in this case, including the fact that it may just take a long time for parties to get their motions going back and forth. Cases can disappear for a long period of time because of dispute resolution. Cases can also just be failure to prosecute and the court never finds out, and after a certain number of years they just take them off the docket. So I think in this case, it is clear that the pending cases statistic is not very meaningful and doesn't illustrate a lot about what is going on in the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, and I will direct this question to you as well. Ms. Aron made much of former Chief Judge Wald's representation of the complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over regulations that she said characterized the court's docket. You acknowledged that the court has ``more than its fair share of complicated regulatory issues,'' but concluded ``that hardly makes up for the heavily skewed absolute number of cases.'' Can you elaborate on the evidence that your opinion is based on? Ms. Severino. Having worked there, I certainly see that these cases do take a longer period of time. Administrative appeals run a broad range of types of issues. They can include simple things like Board of Immigration appeals, up to complex regulatory matters. But the simple fact is that while it may take a longer period of time than criminal cases, which are not as prevalent in the D.C. Circuit, they don't take three times or five times as long. In addition, the case numbers used by the Administrative Office of the Courts to determine judicial emergencies do take into account the type of cases that are used. They are weighted numbers. And again, the D.C. Circuit is nowhere on that list, and I think that illustrates the judgment of the Administrative Office in terms of what numbers are relevant in terms of caseload. Mr. Goodlatte. Ms. Aron, do you think the standards laid out in the Senate Democrats' letter of 2006 regarding the appointment of additional judges to the D.C. Circuit were fair then? And regardless of whether you agreed with them at that time, how is it fair for the public to expect these same standards to not apply when the Democrats control the Senate and the White House? Ms. Aron. Well, first of all, I think we have to start with what the Constitution actually says about judgeships, and it is important to note that President Obama is simply carrying out his constitutional task, an obligation of filling judgeships. That is set out in the Constitution. He is only carrying out his constitutional duty, and the Senate ought to confirm them as soon as possible. With the situation---- Mr. Goodlatte. So you don't agree with the Senate Democrats' letter of 2006. Ms. Aron. Well, I should say that with respect to the nomination of Peter Keisler, it was an incredibly controversial nomination. For one thing, Peter Keisler had worked in the White House, and the White House---- Mr. Goodlatte. Right, but they weren't making their argument based upon his qualifications or his potential position on any judicial decisions he might have to make. They were making their decision solely based upon the lack of need to fill the judgeship based upon the workload of the court. Ms. Aron. Right. Well, that was a situation where we already had the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats filled, and then John Roberts was nominated to the Supreme Court. It was only after several months that Peter Keisler's name came up, and interestingly and for the record, it is important to point out that the Republicans failed to move Peter Keisler's nomination forward. They never held a Committee vote on his nomination, and therefore never reported him out. So, in essence, Republicans---- Mr. Goodlatte. Maybe there was merit to that Senate Democrat standard that caused them to determine--and, in fact, as Senator Grassley noted, it was in the same timeframe that one seat was removed from the D.C. Circuit. Ms. Aron. I think it is important to note now that Judges Silverman, Doug Ginsberg, the Chief Justice, John Roberts, Judge Timothy Tymkovich of the 10th Circuit, are all unanimous in saying that given and because the workload of the D.C. Circuit is so large, so important, so complicated, all of these seats need to be filled. No one, no one questioned that except senators---- Mr. Goodlatte. Well, let me interrupt because my time has expired. But that would be even though the court has a smaller caseload today and more judges to handle the cases when you count both the active judges and the six senior judges, who are carrying a considerable workload on the court. Ms. Aron. Well, I would just say to that point that President George W. Bush filled the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats on the court when the caseload per active judge was lower than it is today. I would also point out that Senator Grassley and his colleagues recently confirmed a judge to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, with caseloads lower than the D.C. Circuit. So, in effect, filling---- Mr. Goodlatte. Let me ask you one more question here. In May, the New York Times quoted you as saying that the D.C. Circuit had ``frustrated the President's agenda.'' It sounds as if you are suggesting that it is proper for judges to decide cases based on subjective factors such as political ideology or affinity to the person who nominated them rather than the rule of law, and can you possibly justify that view? Ms. Aron. Well, those were my views and still continue to be. But the fact remains that presidents have an obligation to fill existing vacancies regardless of what my views are on the matter. Mr. Goodlatte. Even if it wastes taxpayers' money? Ms. Aron. I don't view access to the courts as wasteful of taxpayers' money. In fact, I would view it as a priority. Mr. Goodlatte. Well, access to the courts certainly would be a priority, but if the court has been historically able to function with fewer judges, it is not up to the Congress, including the United States Senate with its advise and consent power, to needlessly fill positions on the court when those positions are not necessary to handle the caseload that has been handled in the past and is not superior to that right now. My time has expired, and the Chair will recognize the gentleman from Georgia for 5 minutes for his questions. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would first ask that a letter from Thomas Sussman, Director of Governmental Affairs for the American Bar Association, dated October the 29, 2013, addressed to yourself, I would ask that it be entered into the record. Mr. Goodlatte. Without objection, so ordered. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Mr. Goodlatte. And while we are doing that, I will also seek unanimous consent to put in the record Senator Arlen Specter, at the time chairman of the Senate--I'm sorry. It is a letter signed by Senators Patrick Leahy, Chuck Schumer, to Senator Arlen Specter, at that time Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated July 27, 2006, setting forth the so- called Senate Democrats' letter standards. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] __________ Mr. Goodlatte. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to point out before I begin that the entire budget of the Federal judiciary makes up less than 1 percent of our entire Federal budget. It is not driving budget deficits and debt, and we know that this is not, this failure to adequately staff our judiciary is not about saving taxpayer dollars. It is really about forming a judiciary that has certain ideological views, and it is my friends on the other side of the aisle that seem to have that aspiration and have been working on that for some time. There is a serious need to fill judicial vacancies on the Federal bench throughout this country. District court vacancy rates are at historically high and unsustainable levels. The number of vacancies that qualify as judicial emergencies due to their high volume of case filings, the length of the vacancy or, if it is a court with only one judgeship, is without precedent. According to one of our witnesses today, according to the Alliance for Justice, over 10 percent of all judges-- excuse me--over 10 percent of all judgeships in Federal trial and appellate courts are unfilled. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law likewise reports that these have been recently higher than at any point since 2002. These vacancies are hurting districts with the greatest need because district court workloads are at record highs. But due in large part to the Republican obstructionism, nominees to the Federal bench face record wait times from nomination to current confirmation in the Senate as compared to other recent Administrations. Senate Republicans have blocked a historic number of district court nominees during this particular presidency. In my own state of Georgia, the Northern District, there are three district court vacancies and two Eleventh Circuit Court vacancies, both Georgia positions. Because we have two Republican senators in Georgia, I think it is no surprise that we have had these vacancies that have been unfilled for years now. A couple of those district court appointments are judicial emergencies, and still, instead of giving deference to the President to nominate candidates of his choosing, we have bargaining going on by our senators trying to install their picks in exchange for allowing the President to get one pick confirmed. So it is almost like it is a game. And who is suffering? It is the American people who have business before the court. Justice delayed is justice denied, and it is really incredible to me to think that we would look at our third co- equal branch of government as a step-child and keep it from doing what is fundamental in our Constitution, in our preamble to the Constitution, to establish justice. I mean, that is the first thing that is mentioned, and we are treating our judiciary as if it were a step-child and something that we can just lord over. It is wrong. Is there any other explanation for the failure to confirm judges for the Federal bench throughout the nation other than what I have stated today? Does anyone want to answer that question? Is there any other reason? Ms. Severino. Congressman, I think there is that clear additional reason, one that is identified by Russ Wheeler of the Brookings Institution, no conservative apologist, and that is the President's failure to move quickly to make nominations to these seats. He identified that---- Mr. Johnson. All right. Well, let me stop you right there. Ms. Aron, you apparently have some---- Ms. Aron. I would differ from the other witness. In fact, 90 percent of the vacancies today are due to the fact that Republican senators, either two senators in some states or one senator in other states, are blocking the progress of candidates. The delay is due almost entirely to Republican senators, and I am pleased to say that the President has actually picked up the rate of nominations and now has out- paced President Bush, and I think President Clinton in terms of number of nominations. So it is not the number of nominations. It is the fact that they cannot get through the states, and once they are on the floor, they are blocked by Republican senators. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Franks [presiding]. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Coble for 5 minutes. Mr. Coble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. I want to revisit the New York Times quote. Ms. Aron, it sounds to me as if you were suggesting that it is proper for judges to decide cases based upon subjective factors such as political ideology or affinity to the person who nominated them rather than the rule of law. I find that irregular. Ms. Severino, can you illuminate in this irregular darkness in which I sit, responding to Ms. Aron's response? Ms. Severino. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? Mr. Coble. I said it appeared to me from the New York Times quote that Ms. Aron was more concerned about ideology and loyalty to the person doing the nominating than the rule of law. This comes down irregular to me. Now, what am I missing? Ms. Severino. Unfortunately, I have to agree with you. I think her quote saying that we need to restore balance to the court by filling empty seats and pointing to the fact that the majority has made decisions frustrating the President's agenda I think clarifies the reason that these seats are being filled right now. All the discussion of judicial emergencies is obviously not what is going on in the D.C. Circuit here. I absolutely agree that judicial emergencies should be filled. But given the fact that there is no such emergency in the D.C. Circuit and that Ms. Aron has pointed to the President's agenda as a reason to fill the seats, I think it is clear that that is what is going on, not a real concern for filling the seats in that circuit. Let's fill the judicial emergencies first. Mr. Coble. Well, the circuit has the lowest workload in the nation. Am I correct? Ms. Severino. That is correct, whether you look at appeals filed, appeals disposed of, appeals disposed of on the merits, virtually any statistic. Mr. Coble. Mr. Chairman, and I say to the witnesses, and the panel, this seems to me to be an ideal case of where prudence should prevail. Savings could be realized and no one would be penalized. Am I missing the mark? Hopefully not. I miss the mark from time to time. Ms. Severino. Even if it is a small percentage of the Federal budget, it seems like a good use of taxpayer money to be prudent and not over-spend where we don't need it. Mr. Coble. As Senator Grassley indicated, if we got more judges, there wouldn't be enough work for them to go around. He explained that one of the sitting judges stated that. Ambassador--by the way, it is good to have North Carolina exposure here, you and Ms. Severino. You didn't make the cut on that, Ms. Aron, or did you? Did you have Carolina connections? Ms. Aron. No. Mr. Coble. We will forgive you. Ms. Aron. A New Yorker. Mr. Coble. We will hold you harmless for that. Ms. Aron. Through and through. Mr. Coble. We will hold you harmless for that. I was going to ask the Ambassador one question, Mr. Chairman, if I can find it. Ambassador, I noticed that you relied heavily on quotes from now-Senior Judge Harry Edwards. What makes his perspective so persuasive to you? Ambassador Gray. For two reasons. First, he did, as I indicated in my testimony, rescue the D.C. Circuit from really a fractious period, and launched it on what has been a two- or three-decade-long period of stability and predictability, and this is something which every judge finds to be an incredibly important component of his or her work there, to provide predictability for the regulated community in this country. That is why I quote him so extensively, because he has thought about it and seen it and overseen the shift from, as Frankfurter called it, ``the collectivity of fighting cats'' to one of, if not the most, collegial court in the country. It also happens to be that he was a Democratic nominee, so this is not a partisan pitch on my behalf. Mr. Coble. Well, I thank you both, all three of you, for being here. Ms. Aron, I didn't give you a chance to respond to the New York Times. I assume that you were correctly quoted. Ms. Aron. I was correctly quoted, and I stand by the quote. But I think that certainly the D.C. Circuit has, in a number of instances, gone out of its way to invalidate many of the President's critically important initiatives, and that is a result of Republican court-packing of the D.C. Circuit. But put that aside because we are not talking about court packing and ideology at this hearing. As I understand it, this is a hearing on filling vacancies on the court, and ideology-- there is nothing in the Constitution regarding ideology and filling vacancies. Put simply, this President has an obligation, an obligation that has been honored and revered over time by every other president, and he is simply carrying out his constitutional duty to fill existing vacancies. In fact, if you look at the three candidates who have been put forth for the D.C. Circuit, you will find three supremely qualified candidates. I would never expect that any of them would upset the current collegial climate on the court. In fact, all three are well known. One is currently a district court judge who was unanimously confirmed to the district court just a few years ago. So I hardly think---- Mr. Coble. My time has run out, so if you will wrap up. Ms. Aron. Okay. I think I am done. Mr. Coble. I assume that you don't agree with my irregular stand from your response, and we can respectfully disagree on that. The people to whom you referred--and I will be through in just a minute, Mr. Chairman--may well be qualified, but they are not needed. The tasks are being performed without their presence there. So with that, I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Franks. I thank the gentleman. The Chair will now recognize himself for 5 minutes for questions. Ambassador Gray, if it is all right, I will begin with you. It appears some of our friends on the left have concluded that the court is irretrievably biased against their perspective and that the only remedy, even though the court seems to be evenly split, as it appears, but their only remedy is to stack the deck against those who challenge the expansion of the administrative state. What evidence do you have that they have misdiagnosed the problem and are overreaching in their attempts to reverse outcomes with which they disagree? Ambassador Gray. I don't see any evidence of bias in favor or against the current Administration. What the data show very clearly are that the reversal rates work the other way. That is to say the current Administration has been reversed less than the predecessor Administration of George Bush, and I would take just a minute, if I may, to use as an example one of the cases that Senator Schumer complained about when he said we are going to fill up the D.C. Circuit one way or the other. He was talking about--this is a technical case. Some of you may be familiar with it, the cross-state pollution rule which the D.C. Circuit rejected. Now, the interesting thing about that is that is the follow-on case to an earlier rule, the same rule basically, that the D.C. Circuit threw out after it had been issued by President Bush. So the origin of this case that Senator Schumer is complaining about is an anti-Bush case, not an anti-Obama case. I can't really think of an example that more disproves Senator Schumer's case better than that one instance. Mr. Franks. Thank you, sir. Ms. Aron, I would like to follow up with Ambassador Gray's comments. He cited Federal court statistics that show that the court reversed administrative agencies in only 16.7 percent of the cases it decided during the 2009-2012 reporting period, and that compares with 18.8 percent of the time during the Bush years. It sounds as if the numbers don't back up the assertions that the judges on the court, including the ``Republican- appointed majority,'' are biased against the Administration. Besides anecdotes, what is your evidence to the contrary? Ms. Aron. Well, I think what we ought to consider and what has been considered by the Judicial Conference of the United States, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, is pending cases per active judge, not filings, not completions. It is interesting. In 2012, the D.C. Circuit was only operating with seven out of twelve judges. How could you look at completions when the number of judges was down? I would say anybody that has looked at this issue, Republican and Democrat alike, has concluded that pending cases per active judge is the standard. And again, as I have said, President George W. Bush, when he filled the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats, the active caseload per judge was lower than it is today. This is not an issue of caseloads. Mr. Franks. Let me--sorry about that. Let me go ahead and speak to that and ask you about this. Ms. Severino noted that the court has had to cancel sittings in recent years due to the lack of cases scheduled for oral argument. Indeed, in 1985, the court adopted a case management plan that required judges to sit in 4-day sessions and hear oral arguments in 112 cases per year. For years now they have sat in 3-day sessions only and had been scheduled to hear oral arguments in 72 cases a year. So how does that square with these facts--these facts, how do they square with the claims on your part that the court's workload has significantly increased in recent years? And also, how do you reconcile this reduction in workload with your support for 138 percent increase in active judges? Ms. Aron. Well, I cannot base my answer on anecdotal information. Mr. Franks. Well, these are not anecdotal. This is not anecdotal information at all, Ms. Aron. Ms. Aron. I can only base it on active pending caseload. Mr. Franks. These are the statistics. This is not anecdotal. I am asking you, other than anecdotal information, what information do you have, what evidence do you have that the court has somehow become more activist against this president than the previous president? What evidence do you have that their workload has increased that would require 138 percent increase in judges? Ms. Aron. Okay. So, those are two separate questions. Mr. Franks. They are. Ms. Aron. All right. Mr. Franks. You have made assertions in both areas. If you would just give me evidence in either one of them, I would be happy. Ms. Aron. Okay. Well, let's deal with the ideological part first. Mr. Franks. All right. Ms. Aron. And then we can deal--I think I just responded-- with the caseload. If you look at the results in cases coming out of the D.C. Circuit, whether it is environmental protections, the D.C. Circuit struck down an EPA rule that was intended to control air pollution across state lines. That rule, had it gone into effect, would have prevented from 13,000 to 24,000 premature deaths. Worker rights. This court of appeals invalidated three of President Obama's nominees to the National Labor Relations Act. This court invalidated an FDA cigarette warning label a few years ago. This court struck down a regulation that was promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank that would have made it easier for shareholders to propose their own nominees to corporate boards of directors. Mr. Franks. Thank you, Ms. Aron. Ms. Aron. But again, as I have said, as I have said, my views and what this court has done has relatively little relevance to the issue about which we are here today, which is filling existing vacancies, and our position is that it is critically important. In fact, it is the constitutional task for the President and the Senate to confirm judges to the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Franks. Thank you, Ms. Aron. And I will now recognize Mr. Bachus for 5 minutes. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. I think in 2006--and I don't know if you have a copy, Ms. Aron, of a letter that Senator Joe Biden and Patrick Leahy and Chuck Schumer and Ted Kennedy and four other Democratic, or five other Democratic senators sent to then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter. They urged them to tend to actual judicial emergencies before moving forward with nominees to the D.C. Circuit. Do you think they were right to do that? Ms. Aron. Well, I am reading this letter, and I would say that the---- Mr. Bachus. Look at the next-to-the-last paragraph, ``we should turn to nominees first and emergency vacancies should clearly take priority over a possibly superficial one, and that is the need to fill an eleventh seat on the D.C. Circuit.'' Ms. Aron. I am looking at the paragraph before that, and I have---- Mr. Bachus. But tell me about that one, and then we will go to the one before that. Ms. Aron. Well, I certainly can see the reason that Senators Schumer, Leahy and others wanted to---- Mr. Bachus. Joe Biden, Vice President Joe Biden. Ms. Aron [continuing]. Wanted to maintain some process. Mr. Bachus. No, I am not talking about that paragraph. Ms. Aron. It looks to me like what was happening at that point, in 2006, is that---- Mr. Bachus. Well, they said their caseload wasn't sufficient. But look at that next-to-the-last paragraph. Would you do that? I don't know if you can read that, but they said that emergency vacancies should clearly take priority over what they described as superficial---- Ms. Aron. Sir, I think that last paragraph has to be read in context, not alone. And it looks to me---- Mr. Bachus. They were asking him not to appoint someone to the D.C. Circuit because---- Ms. Aron. No. What they were doing in this letter, as I read this letter, is they were saying do not rush this nomination through before--and there is a very important point made in this letter--before the American Bar Association has an opportunity to evaluate this nominee. They shouldn't rush this nominee through. Mr. Bachus. But they also said emergency--they clearly said emergency appointments should be made first. Ms. Aron. Well, I see that. But I am just saying there is a larger context here. The information wasn't in on Mr. Keisler. No one could really vote, and we wouldn't want to vote on nominees to the Circuit Court before we know what their records are. That is what this letter is saying. Mr. Bachus. No, it is not. The next-to-the-last paragraph says they ought to give priority to the emergency vacancies. That is exactly--I am going to read it. ``Emergency vacancies should clearly take priority, and we have 34 of those.'' That is what it says. Let me ask you this. When school children come up here, we talk to them about the Constitution. We show them the three branches of government. We talk about checks and balances. Do you think that a consideration for who sits on a circuit court or an appeals court ought to be whether they rule in favor of the executive branch? Do you think that ought to be even part of the equation? Ms. Aron. No. I think we should select nominees based on qualifications of intellect, analytical skills, judicial temperament, honesty. Mr. Bachus. But you said in the New York Times, you talked about they keep ruling against the Administration, you need to appoint someone that will---- Ms. Aron. Well, it is my belief that we must--and I think the Administration has done an exemplary job of selecting---- Mr. Bachus. Listen, I realize that you totally support this Administration. I mean, for the record, I totally acknowledge that. What about Mr. Gray's testimony and the numbers? Is there anything wrong with these numbers, that this court turned down almost 19 percent, 18.8 percent of the Bush--reversed the Bush Administration administrative agency rules, and only 16.7 percent during the Obama Administration? So this court has not been more adverse, or is there something wrong with those numbers? Ms. Aron. I don't believe there is something wrong with those numbers. I just don't think those are the relevant numbers to consider at this hearing, and they certainly aren't the numbers that have been considered by the Judicial Conference. Mr. Bachus. What about the fact that the court has gone from 4 days a week to 3 days a week in their sessions, and they have had to cancel hearings? Were you aware of that? Ms. Aron. I do not actually believe, one, that that is accurate; and two, I think---- Mr. Bachus. Ms. Severino, it was your testimony that they had gone from 4-day sessions and heard oral arguments on 112 cases, and for years now they have had 3-day sessions only and been scheduled to hear oral arguments in 72 cases a year. Is that correct? She said she didn't believe it. Ms. Severino. As far as I am aware, that is correct. I believe that was something Mr. Franks was quoting from a different source. It was from the Administrative Office or the Clerk of the Court. Mr. Franks. We also have statistics here that show that in 2006, the average per-judge cases was 90. That is when the letter was written. And today it is 81. So there is a marked decrease rather than an increase. Mr. Bachus. But, I mean, she said that she didn't think those figures were accurate. Was your testimony inaccurate? Ms. Severino. I think the statistics are quite clear on all of these issues. It is just a matter of whether you want to pick and choose them to find the one statistic that shows--for example, she has picked the pending cases and said at the time of these earlier nominations the court was less busy than it is now. But actually, if you look at any other statistic you will see that despite the decrease in number of active judges, from 10 judges to 8 judges, now we have almost equivalent striking the way the court creates law has remained the same, and in some cases gone down. It depends on what statistic you look at, cases filed per active judge, cases disposed of per active judge, cases disposed of on the merits, cases disposed of after oral argument, cases scheduled for oral argument per judge. All of these show either the cases have remained almost identical or have actually gone down in several of these. So you can point to this one, pending cases, but I think there are a lot of good reasons that the other issues make more sense. Those are the statistics I would rely on. Mr. Bachus. Ms. Aron, in the New York Times you made the point pretty vocally that this court has frustrated the President's agenda. But if they believe that those rulings violate the law, isn't their job to be a check on the executive branch? Ms. Aron. Absolutely, absolutely. Mr. Bachus. Thank you. Mr. Franks. I thank the gentleman. And I would now recognize Mr. Holding for 5 minutes. Mr. Holding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Severino, I have read with interest the Virginia Law Review article regarding the D.C. Circuit written by John Roberts, and several advocates for packing more judges into the D.C. Circuit have cited this lecture or article written by the Chief Justice in their support of their effort. What do you think is a fair reading of the article, and what is the main take-away from it? Ms. Severino. I think it is actually ironic that they cite this article because, if anything, the main take-away point is--it is really a historical piece, first of all. It is not talking about the caseload of the courts. But his main take- away point is the unique role of the D.C. Circuit in reviewing decisions of the national government, and he actually points to the reason that that makes it particularly vulnerable. He relates a story from the 19th century, from President Lincoln actually, who eliminated the court entirely because he wasn't happy with its rulings. And while we are not hearing calls today to have the court completely eliminated, we are hearing a very similar type of argument pointing, as Ms. Aron did, to the results of the cases, not actually to the legal standing. Maybe someone who is a fan of a particular EPA regulation would like to see it upheld, but that is not the court's question that they are considering. They need to consider is this regulation within the authority of the statute. Similarly with the NLRB appointments. It is not would we like more commissioners on the NLRB, are we pro or against workers' rights. That wasn't any issue in the case. The case was how is the recess appointments power to be interpreted. These are the issues that the judges should be looking at. They shouldn't be--Republican or Democrat nominees should not be looking at whether it is a policy result they should want. They should be looking simply to keep the court within its constitutional and legal boundaries. That is their unique role, as the Chief Justice pointed out in this article, and it does make them vulnerable to political attacks, but I am hoping that the D.C. Circuit will be able to maintain its role because we certainly need that check to maintain our checks and balances. Mr. Holding. Well, it is a fascinating article. I want to turn away from the D.C. Circuit for a moment. My frame of reference is the Eastern District of North Carolina, where I used to practice, which has been ranked as the number- one most efficient district court in the nation. It dispenses with more cases in a more efficient manner than any other court, and I think it far out-ranks number two. One of the ways that the chief judge in the Eastern District has been able to clear backlogs and keep up with a robust docket is having visiting judges come in from around the nation, either senior judges or judges from other districts that have a very light caseload. I wonder if there has ever been a study done that looked across all districts and saw where there was excess judicial capacity in other districts and said that, well, we can apply that excess judicial capacity to districts that are over-worked or have higher caseloads, if there has ever been a concerted effort to do that, to any of you all's knowledge. Ambassador Gray? Ambassador Gray. I am not aware of any study that has been comprehensive about this, but the practice of inviting in judges to alleviate shortages is not unheard of. I mean, it does happen, and senior judges do move around where they are most needed, including Supreme Court retirees. Ms. Aron. I would just say I think the Judicial Conference takes into account numbers of judges and pending cases being argued. I just want to mention, though, that the Eastern District of North Carolina has the longest standing district court vacancy in the country. Mr. Holding. And I would point out that being the most efficient district in the country may indicate that they have enough judges. But, Ms. Severino, you were going to add a comment. Ms. Severino. Certainly. The Administrative Office of the Courts actually does keep statistics on this, and it actually lines up in some ways with the workloads of the circuits. You will see the Eleventh Circuit has--I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but it has a very large number of visiting judges that come in. That is clearly the busiest circuit right now by almost any statistic that you look at, sometimes five times more busy than the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit, however, at least in the past year, and I am not aware of any time in recent history that it has had any visiting judges, simply again because there is not the need for it at all. There is barely enough work to go around, as the judges have mentioned. So that is another good indicator of the need for judges on a court. Mr. Holding. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Gowdy [presiding]. I thank the gentleman, the former United States Attorney from North Carolina. The Chair would now recognize a former United States Attorney, Mr. Marino. Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman, and I apologize. I had some people that were waiting in the hall, and I didn't want them standing out there that long. I am sure they have other important things to do. Ms. Aron, I have some questions, and I hear you making your argument based on the Constitution. Am I correct in that? You are looking at this from a constitutional point of view. Ms. Aron. The Constitution, and I would say standard operating procedures. This is what every president does, is fill vacancies. Mr. Marino. Okay, but there has still been a lot of standard operating procedures here in D.C. that have taken place over the last 50 years in both parties that have put us $17 trillion in debt. I clerked for a Federal judge, I was a prosecutor for 18 years, and I worked in a factory until I was 30 years old, and I know what it is like to stretch a paycheck from week to week and how my wife stretches a buck still today, particularly with kids in college and the whole nine yards. Let's set the constitutional argument aside for a moment. I think the President has a responsibility, every president. And, by the way, every president for the last, I think it is the last 40, maybe even 50 years, they have contributed to the debt. Every single president has added to the debt. It is just getting in bigger numbers over the last 50 years. So enough blame to go around. But I think the President has a responsibility to the taxpayers as well. He or in the future she is the CEO and has to watch the bottom line. Now, there was a statement made, and I do agree with this because I read it somewhere before, that judges annually cost about $1 million with salaries, benefits, their staff, the whole nine yards. So did I miss or did you not bring up in your opening statement when you were talking about so many cases per judge? I didn't hear you bringing up senior judges. So correct me if I am wrong. You based that division of cases on what we refer to as sitting or full-time judges, correct? Ms. Aron. Correct. Mr. Marino. Okay. Now, where I came from, the Middle District of Pennsylvania, we have six sitting judges or ``full- time'' judges, but we also have seven senior judges that are still costing the taxpayers $1 million a year, okay? So I think it was--I think you should have not left out that those senior judges, at least what I am familiar with in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, are carrying near or full caseloads. And I know, because I have tried cases as a U.S. Attorney myself in front of not only the sitting judges but the senior judges. So there is some misconception there. I think it is skewed, and if you are going to divide the cases, you need to divide them with the sitting full-time judges and the retired judges. Just so the public knows, first of all, the circuit courts don't hear trials. They hear appellate cases. They hear when someone doesn't like the decision, whether it is the plaintiff or it is the defendant, or whether it is the government, they hear legal arguments as to whether a person should get a new trial or a new sentencing. So that is very different from hearing trials, hearing cases, going to trial, taking guilty pleas, sentencing, the whole nine yards. District courts are very busy. So if there is anywhere, if there is anywhere that we should be looking to increase Federal judges, it should be in the district court area because of the numbers of cases. When I was a U.S. Attorney, and I still communicate with my colleagues, the same number of judges are there, six sitting full-time and seven seniors. When one of those seniors dies, that increases the caseload. Thank goodness, at least in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, we have seven great senior judges that are there. So that is a misconception, and I am disappointed that you didn't factor that in. Ms. Aron. May I respond? Mr. Marino. Please. Ms. Aron. Okay. First of all, we are looking at active Federal judges. You know from your time as a clerk and U.S. Attorney that a senior judge can leave the bench at any time he or she wants. They don't serve---- Mr. Marino. Okay. Let me---- Ms. Aron. They are not there for life. Mr. Marino. Let me stop you right there, though. But they don't. They don't. Ms. Aron. But they can. Mr. Marino. But they are still there. They are still there collecting full pay and full benefits. Ms. Aron. But they can opt out of the very complex regulatory cases if they---- Mr. Marino. They can. Okay. Why don't we wait until that point? Why don't we wait until that point when they opt out and say I don't want to do this any longer, and then assess the situation? Ms. Aron. Okay, here is the answer why. Mr. Marino. Okay. Ms. Aron. Because just like the Administration, the Judicial Conference has to plan, has to take into account what the caseload will likely be in the future, and in taking into account caseloads and in planning ahead, it is very difficult, almost impossible, to know what a senior judge is going to do or not do. Mr. Gowdy. The gentleman's time has expired. I am going to let the gentleman get an answer to his final question. I would just note for Judge Poe and Mr. Collins, votes are probably going to be called in the next 15 or 20 minutes. Mr. Marino. You brought up just a moment ago what if you can't make any statements based on what may happen. Well, the caseloads have actually gone down with the same number of judges, and I think the figures that you were citing are very misleading. And with that, I yield back. Mr. Gowdy. I thank the gentleman. The Chair would now recognize a former state court judge from Texas, Judge Poe. Mr. Poe. I thank the Chairman. Thank you all for being here. Ms. Aron, if I understand your testimony, the bottom line is they need more judges on the D.C. Circuit. Is that right? Ms. Aron. My testimony is that the President has an obligation to fill existing vacancies, and certainly it is in the interest of the public that our courts be fully staffed. Mr. Poe. So is that a yes? Ms. Aron. Did you say you were in Texas? We have eight vacancies now on the district courts in Texas. Mr. Poe. Just answer my question. Do you believe that the issue is they need more judges on the D.C. Circuit? Ms. Aron. Yes. Mr. Poe. That is either a yes or it is a no. Ms. Aron. Yes, I think that court ought to be fully staffed. Mr. Poe. All right. Don't you think a fairer thing to do, to any Administration, be it Republican or Democrat or whatever, that if they need more judges on a circuit court, that the law take effect at the next term of whoever president it is, to set aside any political philosophy? If it is really the need for judges, not need for progressive judges, conservative judges, if it is the need for judges, would not the fairer thing to do to be that the law would take effect for new judges at the next term of whoever is president? Yes or no? Ms. Aron. But that is not what the Constitution says or requires in Article 2, Section 2. Mr. Poe. That is not my question. Ms. Aron. So the answer is no. Mr. Poe. That is not my question. Ms. Aron. The answer is no. Mr. Poe. So it is no. Don't you believe, or do you believe that judicial appointments in Federal court are political? Ms. Aron. Some are, some aren't. Sure. I mean, let's look at--I won't go there. Mr. Poe. But you have your choice, you have your choice. Ms. Aron. Of course some are, some aren't. But that is not the point here. The point---- Mr. Poe. Well, it is the point here. You want a political appointment to serve a certain philosophy of the current president. That has been the history of other presidents as well. Ms. Aron. I would---- Mr. Poe. Excuse me. Ms. Aron. I am sorry. Excuse me. Mr. Poe. It would be fairer that if you need more judges on a particular court, that the next term would allow that, not the current term of the sitting president, to avoid the appearance of political partisanship. That is my point. Ms. Aron. So my response would be I think you would be surprised. Mr. Poe. I would be surprised. Ms. Aron. If you looked at the judges that have been appointed by President Obama, 86 percent of those judges come from corporate backgrounds, come up from state courts, or come from U.S. Attorney offices. In fact, the vast majority of his appointments have been exemplary, have been individuals that enjoy respect from both sides of the political aisle. Mr. Poe. But that is not the issue we are talking about. We are talking about more judges on the D.C. Court. We are not talking about political appointments by the President of the United States in general. We are talking about the D.C. Court and stacking a particular court to meet a certain philosophy. That is really the issue that we are talking about today. Federal judges, in my opinion, are political appointments, political appointments. In other states, or in states, like Texas, we have political elections to determine who judges are. It works for us. We are accountable, of course, to the public. We are elected, but it is still political. Political appointments, to get appointed through the political process to be a Federal judge, it is political. I have talked to a lot of Federal judges. It is very political. That is just the system that we operate under. As far as needing more judges, I have no sympathy for the workload of the D.C. Circuit Court. I was a trial judge. My opinion is nobody should serve on an appellate bench unless they have been a trial judge, or at least a trial lawyer. That is a different issue. But I was a trial judge, and we tried a lot of cases. Appellate courts seem to be the same in my opinion. They want more help, but do they really need it? Maybe not. They have the luxury of hearing a case and then spending time--weeks, months--to make the decision. Trial court judges don't have that luxury. We hear a case, sometimes capital murder cases that I heard, you have to rule right then. You have to make a decision, and then those cases are reviewed. So I don't buy the argument that we need more Federal judges on the D.C. Circuit no matter who the president is. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gowdy. I thank Judge Poe. The Chair would now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, let's just finish up here with the bang that we started with. I am glad that you are here. I am glad the witnesses are here. It is really interesting to see because in just a moment we are going to get to what I call in North Georgia, and maybe around the world, we are going to call a duck a duck. Okay? We have been dancing it the whole time. So we are going to talk about this. What is amazing right now for me is that there seems to be a theme this week, and I am going to tie it together. There seems to be a theme that has developed today and this week really with an Administration and a president who seems to not know what he does and what he doesn't know. I mean, we don't seem to have anyone from the Administration here to shed light on the approach to the courts, and that is probably okay because just like they don't know if they were spying on our allies or building a website that worked, or probably wouldn't know if they were stacking the courts or not, or at least put out a press release to say, you know, we are not sure about that, I didn't know about it. You know, it is a long way fall for a Democrat president who is highly respected who said the buck stops here, to now knowing, well, I don't know anything, I didn't know about that. So let's not worry about what we don't know, because that seems to be the theme from the Administration. Let's do what we do know. We know that there are currently eight judges on the D.C. Circuit evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, and that is a problem. We know that there are three vacancies. We know that the D.C. Circuit Court averaged 41 fewer signed decisions compared to the national average. We know that the D.C. Circuit caseload is the lowest in the nation, less than half the national average. We know that the President and Members of the Senate and, frankly, you, Ms. Aron, have a vested interest, or at least an interest in ensuring that the court has a central role in litigation affecting national U.S. policy and laws, is filled with persons ascribing to his political views. The reason I know that today is because I sat here and listened. I have listened to you, and also read from your article in which you attributed to and said yes, that you agree that you stand by your quote that balance must be restored on that court, the empty seats must be filled. You have stated today that you don't like some of the decisions, and it was in a question-and-answer session where you said we have got to bring back balance because of the decisions that have overturned this Administration that come from a Republican court-packing scheme. And this was your own words from today. In looking at this right here, you also made an interesting question. I want to deal with two things. It is not necessarily the political philosophy which I believe we have, and let's call the duck a duck. There is a political philosophy here that is being played out. But we also have the allocation of resources. Ms. Aron, you have been eloquent in your position, and I respect that--we just have a difference of view here--in saying that it is the constitutional responsibility of the President to fill these vacancies. Well, there are eight emergency slots, and five have not been filled. So would you be on record right now in saying that the President is negligent in his responsibilities? Ms. Aron. No, not at all. Mr. Collins. Why not? You said he has a responsibility, that he has an overwhelming responsibility. You have said it on multiple occasions. So if he has a responsibility to the Constitution, and he has not even named nominees to eight very emergency slots, but yet he has named three to a political slot, wouldn't that be negligence, or asleep at the wheel? Ms. Aron. First of all, I don't think you can distinguish political slots from other judicial slots. But I would say---- Mr. Collins. Well, stop right there. I apologize. I apologize, because you just said something very interesting, distinguishing political slots from non-political slots. In the conversation with the gentleman from Texas, you just basically said, well, some are and some are not. Let's describe that. Are judges political appointments or not? Ms. Aron. They are, but let's take your state of Georgia, for instance. Mr. Collins. Okay. Ms. Aron. You have had a number of vacancies in the state for years, and---- Mr. Collins. Then let's focus on Georgia and not the D.C. Circuit where you just don't like the opinions. Ms. Aron. We should be focusing on all of them, but the topic for today's hearing is the D.C. Circuit. Mr. Collins. So I go back to that, reallocation of assets. If you don't like the result, you want to get your political opinion here. That is the part that--I guess we danced around it long enough. I am bringing it out. You may or may not like it, and that is fine. But it is a political issue. You stated it on several occasions. But this is not about filling a caseload that needs filling. I can agree with you in Georgia. I can agree with you in other places. My friend from North Carolina points out the most efficient court, and they are doing it with a unique perspective. But let's at least get to the point here where I believe that with the other things going on in our country, with the other things with our court system--and I am an attorney as well, and access to justice is an issue--then let's at least be honest with it. Instead of saying, well, it may or may not be, the President appointed these folks because he didn't like what was coming out. It doesn't need to be pushed forward at this point. This is not the court to deal with. Let's deal with the five he has not appointed, because I do believe it is either asleep at the wheel or negligent. Which is it? Ms. Aron. Well, it is neither, sir. Mr. Collins. How can it not be? Ms. Aron. It is neither. I think you have to look at the critical importance the D.C. Circuit holds in our judiciary. It is the crown jewel of the system. It hears the most complex cases. It has judges and has always had judges who have superior analytical skills. It is the court that provides the farm team for the Supreme Court. Four justices on the Supreme Court came from the D.C. Circuit. And I would say to you, talking about politics, that the reason that Senator Grassley and some of his colleagues do not want to fill those seats is solely not due to caseload, because even John Roberts and Timothy Tymkovich disagree with him, and those aren't guys you want on the other side. You want them on your side. They don't want them on the D.C. Circuit because they understand the critical importance the D.C. Circuit has on all of our lives. Mr. Collins. And you just made my case. The President wants the crown jewel. Mr. Gowdy. The gentleman's time has expired. Ms. Aron. No, he wants to fill vacancies, as every other president has. Mr. Gowdy. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair would now recognize himself as the last questioner. I was heartened to hear my friend from Georgia, not Mr. Collins but Mr. Johnson, long for the old days where politics and agenda didn't involve themselves with D.C. Court of Appeals appointments. It made me wish that Mr. Johnson had been around when Miguel Estrada was nominated for the D.C. Court of Appeals, because I think the analysis was a little different then, and it certainly is a little different in South Carolina. I know that Bill Nettles is not a Federal judge. He is the United States Attorney, so that would be a political appointment, with the word ``political'' modifying the appointer and not the appointee. Bill Nettles is an Obama appointee, and he is politically to the left of Chairman Mao. He has done a phenomenal job in South Carolina. I would not hesitate to appear before a Senate panel and recommend that he be re-upped for another 4 years. Bill Traxler is the"
