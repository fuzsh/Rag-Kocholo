        "text": "Following is a list of all Article III United States federal judges appointed by President Abraham Lincoln during his presidency.[1] In total Lincoln appointed 32 Article III federal judges, including 4 Associate Justices and 1 Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the United States district courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office.\n\nIn 1863, the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, which had existed since 1801, was abolished. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) was established in its place with 1 Chief Justice and 3 Associate Justices, all 4 positions being filled by Lincoln. These 4 positions are included in the 27 District Judges appointed by Lincoln.\n\nLincoln appointed 4 judges to the United States Court of Claims, an Article I tribunal. He later laterally reappointed 1 of those judges as Chief Justice of the same court.\n\nSalmon Portland Chase was Lincoln's choice to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nJohn Jay Jackson, Jr. was appointed to what was then the Western District of Virginia - which became the District of West Virginia. He remained on the bench until 1905.\n\nAppointed by Lincoln to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Henry Clay Caldwell was later elevated by President Benjamin Harrison to sit on the Eighth Circuit.\n\nUnited States Supreme Court justices\n\n[edit]\n\n# Justice Seat State Former justice Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Began\n\nactive service Ended\n\nactive service 1 6 Ohio January 21, 1862 January 24, 1862 January 24, 1862 January 24, 1881 2 4 Iowa July 16, 1862 July 16, 1862 July 16, 1862 October 13, 1890 3 8 Illinois December 1, 1862 December 8, 1862 October 17, 1862[2] March 4, 1877 4 9 California Seat established March 6, 1863 March 10, 1863 March 10, 1863 December 1, 1897 5 Chief Ohio December 6, 1864 December 6, 1864 December 6, 1864 May 7, 1873\n\nDistrict courts\n\n[edit]\n\n# Judge Court\n\n[Note 1] Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice 1 D.
