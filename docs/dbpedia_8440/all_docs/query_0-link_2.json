The Solicitor General is appointed by the President and reports directly to the United States Attorney General.\n\nThe Solicitor General's office argues on behalf of the federal government in almost every Supreme Court case in which the United States is a party and also represents in most cases in which the government has filed a brief as amicus curiae. In the United States courts of appeals, the Solicitor General's office reviews cases decided against the United States and determines whether the government will seek review in the Supreme Court. The Solicitor General's office also reviews cases decided against the United States in the United States district courts and decides whether the government will file an appeal.\n\nElizabeth Prelogar has served as Solicitor General since October 28, 2021.\n\nComposition of the Office of the Solicitor General\n\n[edit]\n\nThe solicitor general is assisted by four deputy solicitors general and seventeen assistants to the solicitor general. Three of the deputies are career attorneys in the Department of Justice. The remaining deputy is known as the principal deputy, sometimes called the political deputy and, like the solicitor general, typically leaves at the end of an administration.\n\nThe solicitor general or one of the deputies typically presents the most important cases in the Supreme Court. Other cases may be argued by one of the assistants or another government attorney. The solicitor general tends to argue six to nine cases per Supreme Court term, while deputies argue four to five cases and assistants argue two to three cases each.[2]\n\nSignificance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe solicitor general, who has offices in the Supreme Court Building as well as the Department of Justice headquarters, has been called the \"tenth justice\"[3] as a result of the close relationship between the justices and the solicitor general (and their respective staffs of clerks and deputies). As the most frequent advocate before the Court, the Office of the Solicitor General generally argues dozens of times each term. Furthermore, when the Office of the Solicitor General endorses a petition for certiorari, review is frequently granted, which is influential given that only 75 to 125 of the over 7,500 petitions submitted each term are granted review by the Court.[4]\n\nThe solicitor general is considered an influential and knowledgeable member of the legal community with regard to Supreme Court litigation.[citation needed] Six solicitors general have later served on the Supreme Court: William Howard Taft (who served as the 27th president of the United States before becoming chief justice of the United States), Stanley Forman Reed, Robert H. Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Elena Kagan. Some who have had other positions in the Office of the Solicitor General have also later been appointed to the Supreme Court. For example, Chief Justice John Roberts was the principal deputy solicitor general during the George H. W. Bush administration and Associate Justice Samuel Alito was an assistant to the solicitor general. The last former solicitor general to be successfully nominated to the court was Justice Elena Kagan.[5] Only one former solicitor general has been nominated to the Supreme Court unsuccessfully, that being Robert Bork; however, no sitting solicitor general has ever been denied such an appointment. Eight other solicitors general have served on the United States Courts of Appeals.[citation needed]\n\nWithin the Justice Department, the solicitor general exerts significant influence on all appeals brought by the department. The solicitor general is the only U.S. officer who is statutorily required to be \"learned in the law\".[6] Whenever the DOJ wins at the trial stage and the losing party appeals, the concerned division of the DOJ responds automatically and proceeds to defend the ruling in the appellate process. However, if the DOJ is the losing party at the trial stage, an appeal can only be brought with the permission of the solicitor general. For example, should the tort division lose a jury trial in federal district court, that ruling cannot be appealed by the Appellate Office without the approval of the solicitor general.\n\nCall for the views of the solicitor general\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen determining whether to grant certiorari in a case where the federal government is not a party, the Court will sometimes request that the solicitor general weigh in, a procedure referred to as a \"call for the views of the solicitor general\" (CVSG).[7] In response to a CVSG, the solicitor general will file a brief opining on whether the petition should be granted and, usually, which party should prevail.[8]\n\nAlthough the CVSG is technically an invitation, the solicitor general's office treats it as tantamount to a command.[8] Philip Elman, who served as an attorney in the solicitor general's office and who was the primary author of the federal government's brief in Brown v. Board of Education, wrote, \"When the Supreme Court invites you, that's the equivalent of a royal command. An invitation from the Supreme Court just can't be rejected.\"[9][10]\n\nThe Court typically issues a CVSG where the justices believe that the petition is important, and may be considering granting it, but would like a legal opinion before making that decision.[9] Examples include where there is a federal interest involved in the case; where there is a new issue for which there is no established precedent; or where an issue has evolved, perhaps becoming more complex or affecting other issues.[9]\n\nAlthough there is usually no deadline by which the solicitor general is required to respond to a CVSG, briefs in response to the CVSG are generally filed at three times of the year: late May, allowing the petition to be considered before the Court breaks for summer recess; August, allowing the petition to go on the \"summer list\", to be considered at the end of recess; and December, allowing the case to be argued in the remainder of the current Supreme Court term.[8]\n\nThe Supreme Court has also occasionally invited a state attorney general to express a view on a petition related to that state. In 2009, for the first time, the invitation was directed instead to a state solicitor general,[11] James Ho of Texas, earning the request the nickname \"CVSG-Texas.\"[12]\n\nTraditions\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral traditions have developed since the Office of Solicitor General was established in 1870. Most obviously to spectators at oral argument before the Court, the solicitor general and his or her deputies traditionally appear in formal morning coats,[13] although Elena Kagan, the first woman to hold the office on other than an acting basis, elected to forgo the practice.[14]\n\nDuring oral argument, the members of the Court often address the solicitor general as \"General,\" Some legal commentators such as Michael Herz and Timothy Sandefur have disagreed with this usage, saying that \"general\" is a postpositive adjective (which modifies the noun \"solicitor\"), and is not a title itself.[15][16]\n\nAnother tradition is the practice of confession of error. If the government prevailed in the lower court but the solicitor general disagrees with the result, the solicitor general may confess error, after which the Supreme Court will vacate the lower court's ruling and send the case back for reconsideration.[17]\n\nList of solicitors general\n\n[edit]\n\nImage Name Start End President October 11, 1870 November 15, 1872 December 11, 1872 May 1, 1885 May 1, 1885 August 5, 1886 July 30, 1886 May 29, 1889 May 29, 1889 January 19, 1890 February 4, 1890 March 20, 1892 March 21, 1892 May 28, 1893 April 6, 1893 January 30, 1895 February 6, 1895 July 1, 1897 July 6, 1897 March 16, 1903 February 25, 1903 March 31, 1909 April 1, 1909 September 9, 1910 December 12, 1910 July 15, 1912 July 16, 1912 March 11, 1913 August 30, 1913 November 26, 1918 November 27, 1918 May 23, 1920 June 1, 1920 June 30, 1921 June 1, 1921 May 11, 1925 June 4, 1925 March 5, 1929 May 27, 1929 April 16, 1930 March 22, 1930 May 4, 1933 May 5, 1933 March 24, 1935 March 25, 1935 January 30, 1938 March 5, 1938 January 17, 1940 January 22, 1940 September 4, 1941 November 15, 1941 September 27, 1945 October 4, 1945 October 7, 1946 July 30, 1947 August 15, 1952 December 2, 1952 March 1, 1953 February 10, 1954 July 19, 1956 August 4, 1956 January 23, 1961 January 24, 1961 July 31, 1965 August 11, 1965 August 30, 1967 October 12, 1967 June 25, 1973 June 27, 1973 January 20, 1977\n\nActing January 20, 1977 March 4, 1977 March 4, 1977 January 20, 1981 August 6, 1981 June 1, 1985 June 1, 1985\n\nActing: June 1, 1985 – October 23, 1985 January 20, 1989\n\nActing January 20, 1989 May 27, 1989 May 27, 1989 January 20, 1993\n\nActing January 20, 1993 June 7, 1993 June 7, 1993 June 28, 1996\n\nActing June 28, 1996 November 7, 1997 November 7, 1997 January 20, 2001\n\nActing January 20, 2001 June 13, 2001 June 13, 2001 July 13, 2004 July 13, 2004\n\nActing: July 13, 2004 – June 13, 2005 June 2, 2008 June 2, 2008\n\nActing: June 2, 2008 – October 2, 2008 January 20, 2009\n\nActing January 20, 2009 March 20, 2009 March 20, 2009 May 17, 2010\n\nActing May 17, 2010 June 9, 2011 June 9, 2011 June 25, 2016\n\nActing June 25, 2016 January 20, 2017\n\nActing January 20, 2017 March 10, 2017\n\nActing March 10, 2017 September 19, 2017 September 19, 2017 July 3, 2020\n\nActing July 3, 2020 January 20, 2021\n\nActing January 20, 2021 August 11, 2021\n\nActing August 11, 2021 October 28, 2021 October 28, 2021 present\n\nNote: Some terms overlap because the incumbent remained in office after a successor was named.
