        "text": "Young\n\nAll right, we’re ready to begin. We understand that this recorded session of the Bush Oral History Project is conducted under strict ground rules of confidentiality. We don’t report what is said in here outside the room, and the transcript of the proceedings goes first to the respondent, Governor Sununu, who will determine the uses of this transcript for research purposes and for archiving purposes. We do this in order to encourage candor and to assure you that we are not journalists looking for a story or running out to write a book, carrying words out of the room. That’s your privilege—you can report what you say here to anybody, but we cannot. With that said, let’s begin. If you’d like, you can start us off, John Sununu, or we would certainly like to hear early today about how you came to join George Bush in the administration and how you thought things should work there and tried to make them work in the White House.\n\nSununu\n\nLet me start at the early end of the chronology. I met George Bush in 1980 when he was running for President against Ronald Reagan. In New Hampshire everybody meets everybody running for President at least once or twice. It so happened that my wife was chairman of the Republican Party in New Hampshire at the time, and so we got to meet them all under very warm and intimate conditions as they tried to convince us to break the rules—to convince her to break the rules of non-commitment in a primary and somehow signal her support. I was a Reagan supporter and if any rules were broken they were broken on my part, by giving advice to the Reagan folks, and I suspect Nancy [Sununu] also leaned that way, but did a much better job of hiding her preference and maintaining her neutrality.\n\nWe got to meet George Bush, we got to meet Barbara Bush and the clan and I liked them, although I really felt at the time that ideologically and on issues, Ronald Reagan was a better choice for the Republican Party in 1980. I went on to run for the U.S. Senate. I was one of a field of eleven running for the U.S. Senate against John Durkin. Frankly, I wanted to run because I always thought the bumper sticker I would use was If you want to keep a jerk in, vote for Durkin. Everybody knew Durkin was vulnerable, so we had the attorney general of the state, Warren Rudman, we had former Governor Wesley Powell, we had, I think, the Senate president and the speaker of the House and the former Senate president and a former speaker and a couple of key legislators and an encyclopedia salesman named Smith and somebody named Sununu who decided to run.\n\nIt was interesting because Wesley Powell the former Governor was from the same county I was in, the second largest population county at the time, Rockingham County. I ended up coming in second to Warren Rudman by about 3,000 votes or something like that and Wesley Powell took 25,000 votes, I think, and most of them from our county, so I managed to scare Warren. And then, since he was the only liberal in the primary, I agreed to serve as his state chairman and try and hold the Republican conservatives, because in those days we had a three party system in New Hampshire: the Democrats, the liberal Republicans, and the conservative Republicans. When a liberal Republican won, the conservatives sat on their hands and vice versa. I told Warren I’d be willing to serve as his chairman, we held the conservatives and Warren won.\n\nI bring that up because there is a lot of New Hampshire politics in what we are going to talk about later and that’s an important period of time. The next year I thought I had had my glorious political experience, coming in second in a Republican primary for U.S. Senate. I went back to my engineering consulting business and teaching on the faculty at Tufts and they all came—not all, but Jimmy Cleveland in particular, who was the sort of senior Republican in the state at the time. He was a Congressman and asked me to run for Governor against the incumbent Democrat Governor, and I said it sounded like too much work. It was not going to be a good Republican year, and I thought Governor took too much time. Finally they convinced me. I ran for Governor. I won a very heated primary against the Senate president and then came into—our primaries are in September, so I came out of this heated primary exhausted and broke and ready to run against an incumbent Governor and needed to raise money quickly.\n\nSo I picked up the phone and called a gentleman I had met about a half a dozen times in 1980 and asked him to come up and do a fundraiser for me; the Vice President of the United States, George Bush. This was like the 10th of September, it was the primary, I don’t remember the exact date. He agreed and eleven days later we held what turned out at that time to be the largest single fundraiser ever held in the state. We raised $200,000 to $300,000, which was significant money in a New Hampshire gubernatorial campaign at the time, and I actually went on to defeat an incumbent Democrat in ’82. I think I was the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democratic Governor in ’82. So, you remember somebody who on short notice came up and made a difference for you. You develop a relationship, you get to know each other well over a period of time. I was serving then as Governor, he was the Vice President of the United States. Governors interact with the President and Vice President often.\n\nNew Hampshire Governors find their phone calls returned quite quickly (laughter). I took full advantage of that.\n\nMilkis\n\nWhy is that?\n\nSununu\n\nThe Vice President was gracious. He and Mrs. Bush entertained Nancy and me when we went down there. A couple of times we stayed with them in the vice presidential residence and we developed a good personal relationship. I found out that on critical issues of economy and free enterprise in the market, George Bush was actually a lot more conservative than I had perceived him to be originally. Frankly, we just evolved into a relationship where it was, at least in my mind, almost a foregone conclusion that I would support him if he chose to run for President in 1988.\n\nI’ll apologize now for what I’ve described to you already as my senior moments. I don’t remember the dates quite well and we might have to go back and check dates, but I believe in October of ’86, Lee Atwater came up and talked to me. I had gotten to know Lee over the years and he had committed to run the Vice President’s campaign for President. Atwater came up to basically ask me to support the Vice President in a formal way as early as possible. I told Lee I would do that if we could put a strategy together that made sense to win the nomination. So over a period of phone conversations and meetings, Atwater and I put together what was really a Governors-based strategy.\n\nIt was the first time, I think, that anybody in Washington put that kind of strategy together. The conventional wisdom is that the political power of America was in the Congress, in the Senate in particular, and that Senators ran their states so to speak. I don’t know why. Everybody has now discovered how foolish that is, since Governors live amongst the constituents and dispense all the patronage. That’s what politics is all about, working with constituents and, to be very blunt about it, sharing the rewards of the political process with those who like to be involved politically.\n\nAnyway, we did that. I was either about to be or had become—and I don’t remember what had happened, chairman of the Republican Governors Association—so Lee and I decided to use that as a vehicle to work all the Republican Governors. By the time it became obvious to Bob Dole what was happening, George Bush had lined up virtually all, if not all, but one or two Republican Governors as endorsers. In particular, he came out to an RGA, Republican Governors Association, meeting in, I believe it was Albuquerque, New Mexico. There Atwater and I shoveled, one at a time, two, three, four at a time, Republican Governors over to the Vice President’s room at the hotel and locked up the endorsements. So that process evolved, got involved in trying to set the stage that way. Then of course he asked me to co-chair with Senator [Judd] Gregg the New Hampshire effort for the primary.\n\nThey went—and I’ll try to short cut it and then you can ask the questions you want—into Iowa. They were running the Iowa campaign with the old Washington operatives. It worked in ’80, where they did extremely well in Iowa because nobody paid attention to Iowa and anybody who did anything had two legs up. But the same people just had no nose for the politics at the grass roots in the state level and when it was an even playing field. The process they used in ’80 just did not work in ’88. The Vice President came out of Iowa, as everybody knows, I think he came in third. Pat Robertson came in second and Dole won. But again, you guys are making the facts correct, I’m not here to present the facts.\n\nYoung\n\nYou got it right.\n\nMilkis\n\nFinally somebody who understands it.\n\nSununu\n\nAnd he came into New Hampshire exactly where New Hampshire Governors like their candidates to come in, wounded and ready to be saved. I’ll give you a couple of anecdotes because I really think they begin to explain part of the political process and George Bush and perhaps our political involvement, my political involvement. I’m a great believer, even at the national level, in what I call see me, touch me, feel me campaigning. You have to create a personalized, if not personal, relationship with the voters. The master of that is sitting in the White House today. Let me give a context to that.\n\nGovernor [William] Clinton was chairman of the National Governors Association when I was the vice chairman. I then became the chairman the next year; he chaired the executive committee. I know the President quite well. I know how good he is at local politics and I know how smart he was at taking local politics to the national level. We can talk about that later. But anyway, I tried to bring to the Bush campaign, in the year before the primary, an understanding that campaigning in New Hampshire in particular—even though I believe it applied everywhere, it was particularly true in New Hampshire—you had to connect with the voters. The New Hampshire voters take their responsibility very seriously. And they want the candidates to take the campaign seriously. Not themselves seriously, or life seriously, but the fact that this is a serious business and they’re there to make a decision and they want you to be available to them to evaluate.\n\nOur goal in the year before was to get George Bush to shake as many hands as possible. We estimated that he shook about 60,000 hands in the year before the primary. We estimated that we took about five to seven thousand Polaroid pictures of the President and somebody. It is based on my personal theory that if you have a picture of yourself and the Vice President on the mantle, you’ll work awfully hard to make it a picture of yourself and the President. And believe me, that’s what politics is all about. So we did that. We did a couple of things that seemed really strange at the time that in retrospect were probably the best things we could do.\n\nOn New Year’s, in cold Concord, New Hampshire, and it was cold that night, we borrowed a furniture store. Concord has a First Night kind of a structure where people wander around the streets to different events. We took a furniture storefront and moved all the furniture around so that it looked like a homey living room and set up a hot chocolate line. People could come in and have their picture taken and shake hands with the Vice President of the United States and his wife and a couple of his kids and daughters-in-law and so on.\n\nThat night I believe the number is correct, about 3,500 people came through. The Governor of the state was out front handing out hot chocolate and the Senator was handing out hot chocolate and everybody got their picture taken with the Vice President that night. It was cold. People stood in line for a long time, but I think it established a warm feeling that this is where George Bush spent his New Year’s Eve. We went out at the State House steps at midnight, watched the fireworks. In the Reagan vision of photo ops, it was a great photo op.\n\nThe second thing that might give you a feeling for New Hampshire style politics and the feeling I have that politics is a process of investments of time and effort and commitment that eventually, in unseen ways, produce results. In ways you may not anticipate when you do it. Some time in, I believe, early January of the primary year, the President was in Kennebunkport, after they came in on New Year’s Eve. We wanted them to come down, I think the next weekend, to do an interview with Channel 9. It really was an hour and a half ride and he wasn’t very excited about doing it. He wanted to spend time with his family, and, in ways that state chairmen are wont to do, I insisted.\n\nSo the Vice President came down with Mrs. Bush and I think a couple of the kids came, although I’m not positive. As is his style, he was warm and gracious, walked around the TV station, shook hands with everybody, did not only the half hour interview, but gave them some extra interviews for the news that night and just was George Bush—gracious as he really is, of all the political people I’ve run into, just the warmest. After we left, he said, Now tell me again why I did all this? I said, Mr. Vice President, I don’t know, but one day I will tell you.\n\nIf you go through the analysis of that difficult primary, you will remember that it came time to put what was known as the straddle-ad on television. That decision was made, I believe, late Friday, and all the TV stations, particularly channel nine in New Hampshire, had closed their books for the weekend. Well, I picked up the phone and called David [Zamatch], the general manager, who had brought his grandchildren in to have their picture taken with the Vice President and whom the Vice President spent time talking to, and giving out vice presidential pens or whatever it is to the grandchildren and so on. I called David and said, We’ve got to re-open the books and put on a new ad on television, can you? And David got in his car, drove down to the TV station, allowed us to put the ads on Channel 9, which was the most important television station for this weekend.\n\nAfter we finished all that and the ad started running, I had a chance to be with the Vice President and I said, Oh, by the way, you asked me last month why you came down—that’s why. And he nodded his head and understood immediately that again, investing some of his time and his charm and his real friendliness to people made a difference in a way that is hard for people to identify at the time but in retrospect is easily understandable.\n\nAnyway, we developed a very strong relationship. I think he developed a lot of confidence. He came into the state really feeling down. I sat down with the Vice President and Mrs. Bush and my wife, and I said, Mr. Vice President, relax, it’s in the bag, it’s an eight to ten point win. Go to sleep and we’ll go out in the next few days and make it happen. And, as Mrs. Bush was gracious enough to say later, it really made her feel like it was going to happen.\n\nWhat he did in the next five or six days, again, was typical George Bush. We put him in a context where the personal warmth and all the personal see me, touch me, feel me context of the past year were merely reinforced in people’s minds. So they saw that the man that they had met over the past year really was that man and not the man as reported out of Iowa. I think the press talked about it. We put him in a 12-wheeler, we took him to two or three breakfasts a day at Wendy’s and McDonald’s. The press, the Washington press corps and all the Washington consultants were there saying, This is crazy, there are only five or six or ten people in McDonald’s. We’ve got to get him out amongst big crowds. And our message was, No, we’re taking him just to New Hampshire places. We went to a couple of malls, we did town meetings, the whole gamut. But it was an effort to just re-convey the warmth of the Vice President to the people who had already met the Vice President.\n\nHargrove\n\nCan I ask you a question?\n\nSununu\n\nPlease do.\n\nHargrove\n\nI’ve used the word authenticity for what you’re talking about. It’s hard to pin down, but it’s the sense of: I’m a real person.\n\nSununu\n\nYes.\n\nHargrove\n\nYou can connect with me.\n\nSununu\n\nBut it’s not enough. Authenticity is not sufficient because—I shouldn’t say that, it’s not necessary. And I’m going to say something that sounds snide, but I don’t mean it. There is authenticity that has permanence—\n\nHargrove\n\nRight.\n\nSununu\n\n—and there is an authenticity of the second, in which somebody creates an authentic empathy for that second and five minutes later it’s gone, they’re off to something else. President Clinton is a master of the latter. The instant authenticity, the walking down, seeing the cameras are on him and putting the tear in the eye. You know when, I forget, that famous TV clip of the President showing remorse and sorrow, instantaneously on and off? That’s authenticity. People don’t understand it. For that split second, Bill Clinton wasn’t faking sorrow, but he’s able to turn it on and turn it off.\n\nWith George Bush it’s a permanence of empathy that quite often is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. And we can talk about that later on in terms of some of the personnel, but with Bill Clinton its shortness is a great strength, without the attendant weakness. It’s an odd phenomenon that is, in my opinion, an important difference between the two of them, and yet not often understood.\n\nAnyway, we developed a good relationship. We had talked about a lot of the details of what we had to do and why we had to do it and what the net effect would be and, Mr. Vice President, this is the kind of campaign you have to run for the next week. For example, we had made the poor Vice President go to the rural parts of New Hampshire more than other candidates thought necessary. In fact, there was a snowstorm in New Hampshire in the middle of that primary season and we drove to Wolfboro, I believe it was Wolfboro, for a big three or four thousand person rally at the high school, through the snowstorm, stopped at an ice fishing competition that the press thought we were really loony about, and then drove up to Wolfboro to meet these three or four thousand people and back. Of course, the Washington press corps thought that was the dumbest thing they ever heard of, but that’s okay, we got there. If you go back and look at George Bush’s margins, county by county, he got 38 percent in New Hampshire; but in the north country he got between 40 and 50 percent. In fact, his margin of margin all came from the north.\n\nSo it didn’t have that many votes, but it had that many incremental votes that made the difference. Contrast that with Bob Dole in ’96 coming into New Hampshire and never campaigning more than a half hour away from his hotel in Manchester and losing heavily to Buchanan in the north country. You will understand that the campaign was right, but more importantly, George Bush looked at all these strange things and had a feeling, I think, that here were some people who understood politics. And Atwater reinforced everything. I had a great working relationship with Atwater. In fact, I mentioned last night that I think Atwater’s death in the analogy of the nail in the shoe of the horse of the rider probably changed history more than any incidental event I can ever think of, and we’ll talk about that at the appropriate time.\n\nYoung\n\nYes, we really should.\n\nSununu\n\nI bring out all these details here though because it really provided an opportunity for the Vice President, to his credit, to accept the fact that somebody else was going to be responsible for this set of issues, if you will, the campaign. Explain to him how it was going to happen, why it was going to happen and what was going to happen, and I think he was rather pleased and satisfied that the results came out as advertised. You know, people say, How did you ever end up being Chief of Staff? Well, you know, the conventional wisdom is that we delivered New Hampshire. But the point I want to make it is not that we delivered New Hampshire, it is how New Hampshire was delivered that I think meant a lot to George Bush.\n\nIf we had predicted he was going to lose by one point, if we said, We can only hold the loss to one point and this is how it’s going to happen, I think it would have had the same effect. What he was looking for was technical competence in a task.\n\nMilkis\n\nEspecially coming out of Iowa, because the campaign was in such disarray at that point.\n\nSununu\n\nWell it wasn’t in disarray; it was only arrayed in the wrong place. Disarray is not the problem in politics; it is being completely organized and arrayed wrongly that is the problem. They sent Bond up to—\n\nHargrove\n\nChris Bond? No, no.\n\nMasoud\n\nRich Bond.\n\nSununu\n\nRich Bond had done a great job in ’80 in Iowa, went up and tried to do again in Iowa what he had done in ’80, and it was just the wrong campaign at the wrong time. Pat Robertson and Dole went in there. Robertson ran grass roots politics, retail style, in Iowa. Went out and touched everybody’s hand, organized on a personal basis, found an issue that a chunk of Iowa cared about and controlled the caucuses. Dole had a geographic affinity there that cut off a lot of the personal relationships that had been established because nobody else had gone up there in ’80 except Bush. It’s easy to establish personal relationships when nobody is competing with you, but Dole had this geographic affinity of Kansas and Iowa. People said, How come Dole winning in Iowa didn’t make a difference? And I said, Iowa picks corn, New Hampshire picks Presidents.\n\nKaraagac\n\nWhere was Atwater in New Hampshire politics?\n\nSununu\n\nLee was there all the time. Lee understood everything that was going on and if Lee needed reinforcing to put on ads that identified the difference between the President and Dole at that time on taxes, I reinforced that. If I needed Lee to reinforce the fact that he had to jump behind a 12-wheeler or go to three breakfasts or go north on a snowy day, Atwater would support that. Atwater understood. Atwater probably was the best political mind in America of his generation.\n\nI can give you an Atwater anecdote. After Atwater became chairman, I went down to his office one day, he was RNC [Republican National Committee] chairman and I walk in and the television is on and there are two guys in a ring wrestling on television. I say, Atwater, why are you watching that stuff? That’s fixed. He said, What do you mean? I said, You’re watching wrestling. He said, I’m not watching wrestling. I said, You’ve got two half naked guys in a ring, groping each other, that’s called wrestling. He said, I’m not watching wrestling. I said, What are you doing? He said, See the audience? That’s the swing vote in November. And he really believed that the wrestling audience and the stock car racing audience epitomized the swing vote in America. And this is a guy that understood, maybe only Bill Clinton understands as well as he did. And maybe only the three of us believed in see me, touch me, feel me politics as much as Lee. But he understood completely what we were doing in New Hampshire and really just reinforced everything.\n\nYou have to give George Bush credit. George Bush came into New Hampshire tired, exhausted, and beaten in Iowa. And all of his other Washington pollsters and consultants thought that they had to run a campaign that catered to the Washington press corps. Atwater didn’t. I certainly didn’t. Judd Gregg and Hugh Gregg certainly didn’t. The New Hampshire people certainly didn’t. And he has to make a decision, Whom do I go with? Do I listen to the non-conventional wisdom or do I go with all these expensive Washington consultants? And George Bush made the right decision.\n\nHargrove\n\nCan I interject once more?\n\nSununu\n\nYes.\n\nHargrove\n\nI get the impression he did not insist on being his own strategist. That he relied on—\n\nSununu\n\nHe insisted on understanding his own strategy and if there were components in it he didn’t like, he voiced his concerns. For example, he argued vehemently for a long time against the straddle ad and then accepted the recommendation—particularly Atwater’s recommendation at that time and I supported Atwater—that this would be okay to run. The key to that was Barbara Bush finally came in and said, I don’t really think it’s that bad, and so we went with it. But he wasn’t, neither as President nor as candidate did you just hand him something—\n\nHargrove\n\nNo, I understand.\n\nSununu\n\nHe wanted to know why. Why am I coming from Kennebunkport to do this? I had to give him an answer. I honestly couldn’t give him an answer and I said, Mr. President, I can’t tell you why, but it’s the right thing to do. That was okay with him. If I had made up an answer it wouldn’t have been okay with him. In fact, he was probably pleased that I didn’t know why, but he was riding my gut instinct and taking it. That’s the way he did a lot.\n\nHargrove\n\nLater on.\n\nSununu\n\nLater on too. Tell me why, ask a question. Like the answer, don’t like the answer. Can be moved and changed, never rigid, but once he became rigid, stayed rigid. Okay, but like good Jell-O, you can move the fruit around in it until it became solid, but once it became solid, you ruined the dessert by moving the fruit around. Anyway, I bring all of that up because I really do think that year and that week established between us a respect that made me comfortable when he asked me to be Chief of Staff. I knew the kind of person I’d be working with, and I think made him comfortable. I’m trying to remember some of the incidences if I can.\n\nThere were incidences where he disagreed on things we would do and finally, when he said, No, I don’t want to do it because— I said, Okay, fine, we’ll find another way to get the same result. I didn’t come back to try and twist his arm to do something that he finally made a decision that he didn’t want to do. We found another way to achieve the same result. I think that was important for him, that here again, in our relationship—I’m trying to define the relationship for you—here was somebody who felt strongly about things but if he finally indicated, No, it isn’t going to be that way, moved on to find another solution to the same problem. I think that was very important to him.\n\nYoung\n\nCan you give us an example of that?\n\nSununu\n\nYes, the process of going after Mike Dukakis. As you know, Mike Dukakis loved to brag about Massachusetts. Poor Governor Dukakis never realized that of all the six New England states, Massachusetts was the poorest performer, not the best performer. In fact, nobody realized it. The press in Massachusetts just—and I finally came up with all these statistics that identified the laggard nature of Massachusetts in the New England economy. I had a pretty tough set of presentations. The Vice President let me know a couple of times that he didn’t mind my communicating the data, but let’s do it in a kinder, gentler way. And I did. I notched it down until he felt comfortable with what I was doing and then went on with that. And the point is that after he notched it down to where he liked it, he noticed it never went past. In other words, we found an accommodating level of aggressiveness that was consistent with what he wanted the campaign to be seen as. And he felt very confident, I think, that once he drew the line, the line would be respected.\n\nAnyway, that’s how I developed two very important comfort factors—the Vice President I think became comfortable with my full commitment to his agenda and I really felt very comfortable with George Bush’s agenda. And secondly, I became comfortable that here was somebody who was smart enough to know what he had to do and wanted to do and if he felt he couldn’t do things one way was smart enough to say, Now go find me another way I feel comfortable with and let’s do it. And we did it.\n\nMilkis\n\nHow did you understand his agenda at that point in the campaign?\n\nSununu\n\nGeorge Bush really had two agendas. One is he understood completely the criticality of the point in history the world was at, and really and truly felt that it had to be handled by somebody who understood what was happening, that what was going on inside the Soviet Union at the time was so complicated—and it was complicated—that it needed an understanding hand. Not necessarily that he thought he was the only one who could do it, but he thought he was the only one who could pick a good enough team to do it. And frankly at that time, I think the Vice President had in his head that it was critical that the Bush, [James] Baker, [Brent] Scowcroft, Tower team—and I think he had John Tower in mind—was the team that had to deal with the international transition that was taking place. That was his principal agenda.\n\nBut his second agenda which he had in mind—and I will argue executed better than any other President of the twentieth century except [Franklin] Roosevelt’s first term—was a domestic agenda to put into place legislation that dealt with critical needs—the environment, education, the role of the government vis-à-vis the states, the change in technology that was influencing energy policy. A whole host of domestic issues that he understood were timely—perhaps in some cases, like clean air, overdue—and if we let the pressure build up, would be done in the wrong way. George Bush had a very strong commitment to the capitalist free market structure of this country. George Bush came out of a business environment, understood and had a very deep commitment towards the fact that there were people in Washington who didn’t understand and were moving government policies in the wrong direction. And that was a very big part of why he wanted to be President.\n\nMilkis\n\nDid you get a sense, Governor Sununu, about his feelings towards the Reagan Presidency, its accomplishments and his role in history compared to that?\n\nSununu\n\nHe was one of the few people who understood how historic Ronald Reagan’s Presidency was. He kind of bristled at people’s perception of Ronald Reagan as the actor in the White House. He had a tremendous respect for Ronald Reagan as a leader. He understood Ronald Reagan’s style of simplified leadership: identify big issues, target on them, give them an image, and characterize them for what you want to accomplish. And repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat until everybody follows.\n\nHargrove\n\nWas that reciprocated, that response?\n\nSununu\n\nYes. I got to know President Reagan quite well as a young man. In fact, he came up two or three times to New Hampshire. Ronald Reagan was deeply in debt to New Hampshire as you know the story. Mrs. [Nackey Scripps] Loeb is a great friend of Ronald Reagan’s. So, I had great entrée to the Reagan Presidency and got to know President Reagan quite well. When I was making up my mind what to do, I had been up there to talk to President Reagan about some gubernatorial problem and I told him I was probably going to support Vice President Bush for President and his response was warm and enthusiastic and made it very clear to me that this was what he wanted. So I had no doubt about that, no doubt at all.\n\nYou know, Ronald Reagan understood, and George Bush understood, and most people after they’re President understand, that the most important thing you need out of the Vice President, beyond their capacity to serve in that role, is loyalty and commitment and support and, believe me, when that goes in both directions, it establishes a bedrock of a relationship, and it was there.\n\nWhere am I?\n\nHargrove\n\nWell, go to Washington.\n\nSununu\n\nLet me talk about the process of selection. I honestly—\n\nMilkis\n\nAre you going to talk about the general election?\n\nHargrove\n\nOh, well, yes.\n\nSununu\n\nLet me go ahead.\n\nMilkis\n\nThat’s a big jump. And they only have your support. They don’t need the other states.\n\nSununu\n\nHow many are there, 49?\n\nHargrove\n\nAnd they all grow corn.\n\nSununu\n\nNo, no, no, they pick corn. By the way, I’m not pretending to be neutral here. As you know, the campaign was a tough campaign and I made a commitment to the Vice President and I tried to live up to it. I went down to Washington about a day a week, had an office in the campaign down there, talked to Atwater four or five times a day, and frankly Atwater, [Roger] Ailes, and I developed a very close political relationship. And frankly, as immodest as it sounds, I think the problem in ’92 is that Atwater had died, I had left, and Ailes had gone on to be president of—NBC?\n\nMasoud\n\nNo, it was Fox news.\n\nSununu\n\nAnd really, there was no sensitivity to the voter left in the campaign. It was a sterile campaign in the sense it was being run by people who had never had to shove their hand in front of an unwilling voter and ask them to vote for them, or had never had to position a candidate to do that or had never had to cut an ad to convey the warmth of the candidate to people, it was all gone.\n\nHargrove\n\nYou’re talking about ’92?\n\nSununu\n\nYes. I’m saying that’s the difference between ’88 and ’92. So the three of us conversed almost on a daily basis. I conversed with Atwater on a daily basis and with Roger almost on a daily basis, had an office down there. Again, the general election was built on the Governors’ strategy. Let me jump ahead. One of the things missing in ’92 was that we had laid the groundwork for a Governors’ strategy in ’92 before I left. We worked our tails off to get [John] Engler elected in Michigan, to get a Governor re-elected in Illinois, to get a Governor elected in Ohio.\n\nThat election and this coming election—by the way, and I’ll tell you ahead of time, this election is going to be decided in five states, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania, and whoever wins three or four of those states is going to win the election. It was clear to us we built from Michigan all the way down to Texas, a road block, if you would, of Republican Governors in the heartland. The strategy was going to be again a Governors’ strategy based on the theory that politics is based on constituency contact and patronage in the nicest sense of the word. Governors have that access.\n\nI’ll give you another anecdote out of New Hampshire. Other than the U.S. dollar, the second most important currency in the state of New Hampshire are license plates, low digit license plates: two-digit plates, three-digit plates, and four-digit plates. When I became Governor, I sat down with the commissioner of motor vehicles and I said I wanted none of those issued without my personal signature. And I accumulated, over five years—again, not knowing why but instinctively—a collection of two-, three-, and four-digit plates that were un-issued. You only get them when somebody dies and they come back into the package. As we were putting together the Bush organization we would run into somebody who wanted to be town chairman who wasn’t quite decided between Bush and Dole, but if it’s Bush and a three-digit plate, there’s no question.\n\nBut that’s what politics is all about, and that’s why Governors have currencies, in the plural, that make for political strength in campaigns. That’s why we recognize that this north to south roadblock of Republican Governors was a tremendous asset in the ’92 campaign. The guy that used Governors best in ’92 after I left was Bill Clinton. The Washington focused campaign in ’92 couldn’t even name the Republican Governors, that’s an aside.\n\nThe ’88 election comes; we use the Republican Governors really quite, quite well. California was tremendous. In a quiet way, but again, using gubernatorial tentacles behind the scenes is what makes a difference. The issue in ’88 really was Dukakis riding high up through June with this image of a miracle maker in Massachusetts, and the campaign really was all about saying, Hey look, they’re a poor sixth out of six in New England. All Dukakis has done is ride the tide of New England prosperity. And eventually, if not the specific facts, the sense of there’s no magic here, was really, to me, the heart and soul of the change that took place there.\n\nAgain, with all due respect, I think the press gets it wrong. They all talked about Willie Horton. Al Gore brought up Willie Horton. Al Gore found Willie Horton in the Lawrence Eagle Tribune. Two young ladies wrote an article on Willie Horton and won the Pulitzer Prize for it, attacking Mike Dukakis, his policy on releases. Gore brought it up and an independent group, not even our campaign, cut the Willie Horton ad. I don’t think it made that much difference in the sense that I really do think that Dukakis really sowed the seeds of his own destruction. The tank ad, if you remember that, was self-inflicted.\n\nI did get overruled in the campaign by Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes: I wanted music in that ad, I wanted them to be playing in the background Tanks for the Memories. But I lost. I do think that the campaign identified the weakness, stressed the fact that you’re not getting a miracle maker out of Mike Dukakis. George Bush has the experience, the world is poised to deal with a historic set of occasions, and the priorities at that time for the Presidency still had foreign policy at the top. That’s how it was won.\n\nHargrove\n\nHe articulated those themes, the positive themes.\n\nSununu\n\nYes.\n\nHargrove\n\nPrimarily foreign policy, less domestic.\n\nSununu\n\nNo, he articulated domestic themes too. We took, if you remember, his commitment to the environment and went to the Boston harbor and made the Boston harbor environmental speech and incidentally reminded people that Dukakis did not start to clean the harbor up until there was a federal court order. There were positive themes on what he was going to do but always hooked to a Dukakis failure on domestic items. Almost always.\n\nOn jobs we pointed out that the Reagan administration had created—and again, I’m going to give you a number I’m not positive of—three and a half million manufacturing jobs in America, and Massachusetts had lost 4% of its manufacturing jobs at the same time. I’m not positive of either of those two numbers, but it is basically the context. So he emphasized, We are going to keep growing our manufacturing capacity. We’re going to do this for the environment. We have a commitment towards deregulation. We talked a little bit about that. It was a lot of gubernatorial—health care proposals, we talked about that. Restructuring the health care system, a lot of Medicare issues, he talked about giving the states more flexibility. It was a federalism oriented—\n\nHargrove\n\nYes.\n\nSununu\n\nIn spite of Neal Peirce’s probably the third or fourth dumbest political article I’ve ever seen, one of the ones you sent me, Bush ran—\n\nMasoud\n\nWe tried to choose the stupidest.\n\nSununu\n\nNo, I’m glad you sent that one, it reminded me. I had read it when Peirce wrote it originally and it reminded me how absolutely stupid the man is, because he belittled the fact that the Governors at that time were talking about devolution of power back to the states and a federalism approach, and that’s exactly what both Bush and Clinton have committed themselves to. Clinton was absolutely committed to that. In fact, there’s an interesting anecdote, [Mario] Cuomo tried to—I was chairman, I had selected federalism and came out with a bunch of federalism resolutions. Usually, the last meeting you chaired, the National Governors Association endorses them on a pro forma basis and sends them on as an agenda for Congress.\n\nCuomo thought—since I was chairman of the Bush campaign by that time (he still had visions of perhaps running at that time)—he’d stick it to Bush and got about a dozen of the Democratic Governors to start protesting on this thing. It probably would have lost if a Democratic Governor didn’t stand up and enunciate his commitment to the federalist principles, and that Governor was Bill Clinton. It’s an interesting—\n\nHargrove\n\nI don’t want to rush ahead, but no new taxes was a part of the campaign.\n\nSununu\n\nAnd it was part of George Bush’s philosophy. He really believed that the tax structure was too high at the time and—\n\nHargrove\n\nWere you present when Peggy Noonan and [Richard] Darman had a little tiff?\n\nSununu\n\nI wasn’t present but I knew about it. And that’s a very important tiff, because when we come back and talk about the breakfast meeting, the [George] Mitchell, [Thomas] Foley, Bush, Darman, [Nicholas] Brady, Sununu, breakfast meeting, remind me of that.\n\nHargrove\n\nYes, we will.\n\nSununu\n\nI think there is a historic legacy of that tiff that screwed George Bush. But anyway, it was taking issues like Medicare and healthcare reform, the environment, deregulation, and incentives for job creation. There are some secondary issues that he talked about and actually delivered on child care, concern about agriculture reform and reforming the federal subsidy structures. They were all touched on, and yet touched on I think in ways that reflected the Governors’ perspectives. We had two or three meetings in Kennebunkport while he was there during the summer, where we brought Republican Governors in to talk about domestic issues. Really, the President bought into what I would call an RGA agenda, a Republican Governors Association agenda. The RGA had a list of its goals and we basically built on that. And he campaigned state-by-state, being embraced wherever we had a Republican Governor by the Republican Governor, on the issues as enunciated for that state by the Governor. I’ve lost where I was. Oh, the campaign.\n\nWe go through the campaign. Somewhere in May I decided I couldn’t afford to be Governor any longer, to be honest with you. I had served three terms. There had only been two other three-term Governors in New Hampshire, we only have two-year terms. Nobody had ever served four terms. The ego says run for a fourth term, popularity was very high, the pocketbook says don’t. I made my announcement.\n\nWhen the press said, How come you’re not going to run for a fourth term? I said, When you send $20,000 a year to MIT and $20,000 a year to Stanford and $20,000 to the IRS, it doesn’t leave much room in a $60,000 salary. So I was going to go back to the private sector. You think about going to Washington and I had made the decision, unless it was something that really was an opportunity to make a difference, I wasn’t going to go down.\n\nAbout October, I had come down to Washington for a briefing, and for some reason that particular briefing had a big foreign policy component to it. Scowcroft was there. I think John Tower came in for a few moments. Afterwards the Vice President asked me to stay and he said, Look, I haven’t made up my mind yet, but if I decided to ask you to be Chief of Staff—I don’t want you to give me an answer, but I want you to think about it.\n\nI said, Well, I have to go home and get permission, but I’ll let you know. About November first, he asked me again if I had talked to Nancy and I said I had. He said, Well, how are you leaning? I said, I think I can get a note, and so I said okay. Never made a commitment per se but basically said that.\n\nAfter the election he was in West Palm Beach at Will Farish’s home in Palm Beach and it just so happens my mother was living in Del Ray. I think he knew that and he called me up and he said, Why don’t you come down and visit your mother and oh, by the way, when you do that, stop by and see us at Will Farish’s. So obviously I did. I knocked on the door at Will Farish’s and the President and Farish opened the door. The President turned to Will and said, I’d like to introduce you to my Chief of Staff. So that’s how I knew the President had made up his mind.\n\nMasoud\n\nThis was shortly after the election?\n\nSununu\n\nYes, maybe the weekend after.\n\nKaraagac\n\nThat was one of Bush’s favorite famous surprises, was it? Announcing things sort of in line with the kind of—\n\nSununu\n\nYou know, I’ve heard that phrase used before but we’ve never, from the inside, never thought of them as surprises. His processes in selecting—if you remember the climate in Washington was that there was going to be a troika—[Robert] Teeter and [Craig] Fuller each wanted to be Chief of Staff. Deciding that they couldn’t be Chief of Staff, and now in the way that is peculiar to Washington, the only people who really thought there could be a troika were Fuller, Teeter, Ann Devroy and David Hoffman. And that is the process of creating this. The President never had it in his mind, never thought about it, never considered it, never evaluated it, had told them both that they weren’t going to be, had made up his mind, and yet the stories persisted.\n\nBasically all I did was just ignore them, because when the President looks you in the eye and says, That’s going to be it, that’s going to be it. But it’s a very good example of Washington thinking for about a week that there were discussions of this nature taking place, and there were none, none at all. The only people who had this in mind were Fuller and Teeter. And they would sit down with their favorite reporters, Hoffman and Devroy, and put it out there and so Maureen Dowd has to pick it up and they all pick it up and they all call, and the Fuller friends and the Teeter friends are in on it. So Teeter says, Well, don’t just believe me, call so-and-so, and you have a story created out of whole cloth.\n\nThe only discussion I ever had about it was that I offered Teeter the position of Deputy Chief of Staff, subject to the President’s approval. He thought about it for a week and Hamleted about it for a week and then decided not to.\n\nMasoud\n\nYou had also been considered, or at least you had been proposed, as a vice presidential candidate.\n\nSununu\n\nI never took it seriously, for two reasons. One, whether I believe or don’t believe that my birth in Cuba disqualifies me—I was born of American parents. By the way, so was Lowell Weicker, he was born in Paris and tried to run for President. George Romney was born in Mexico City and ran for President. So there is this question, and I suspect with all the kids born of American servicemen overseas, the Supreme Court would say that natural born means that you’re born of American parents. I could have argued that till I was blue in the face. I was also smart enough to know that when you raise an ambiguous issue in a presidential campaign, it does nobody any good. So I never took it seriously, but I was certainly flattered by it.\n\nMilkis\n\nWere you involved at all in the selection of Senator Quayle?\n\nSununu\n\nNo, because as one of the ones in the mix—\n\nMilkis\n\nOh, I see, you couldn’t.\n\nMasoud\n\nBut had you given any thought as to where you would want to be in this administration?\n\nSununu\n\nYes, I would only have gone down for Chief of Staff. I wouldn’t go down for anything else.\n\nMasoud\n\nNo Cabinet position?\n\nMilkis\n\nI thought I read that there were two positions you were willing to take.\n\nSununu\n\nI may have said two, but really only meant one. You know, if I said only one, they would have said, Which one? One out of two, one or two is an honest answer that has enough softness in it.\n\nHargrove\n\nIt’s a big job, but did you also think it fitted your talents?\n\nSununu\n\nYes, I had been Governor. I’m not a modest person. I know how to make things work, I mean, I made a living making things work for people. I was a consultant to Xerox, to General Motors, to Westinghouse. I only came in on crisis jobs where they’d spend a lot of money and a lot of time so that I could charge exorbitant amounts of money for a quick solution, and made a nice living out of it. And as Governor, I made a commitment to take a state with a deficit and not raise taxes and turn it into a surplus. In a year we went from an 8% deficit to a 6% surplus. So I believed I could make the trains run on time and do it in a way that understood the political needs of the people and responded to a political agenda and made the system better. You know, you can make the trains run and not make the system better. I knew the difference between just making the trains run and making the system better.\n\nHargrove\n\nBecause you had become a politician. Engineer first, then politician.\n\nSununu\n\nYes, look, I took a state that was in serious trouble and by the time I left, it may be a Michael Dukakis statistic, but I think the unemployment rate was under 2%. We had the fastest growth rate in New England. We stole tons of businesses from poor Mike who didn’t know what was happening. We had a huge surplus in the state. I had the last term literally struggled to find one-time spending items to put in the budget so there was not a momentum for spending for the future. We bought tons of land, created a rainy day fund, all these things to stash money away because it was coming in faster than I could hide it and I didn’t want the legislature, Republican as it was, to spend all of the money.\n\nSo by that time I thought I understood the nuances of government and the role of the executive branch. I also thought I was beginning to understand the process of making decisions in the public sector versus the private sector, which is the hardest thing that you have to learn, by the way. In the private sector you are rewarded for being able to make quick decisions and implementing them quickly. In the public sector you have to drag out the minuet so that everyone gets a chance to dance and lead the band.\n\nSometimes when you know what the decision is going to be, it’s agonizing to sit through the consultations. So I developed what I called the spaghetti theory of decision-making. You get everybody who wants to be in on the decision, you get them in the room, you let them talk for as long as they want and eventually, at some point in there the spaghetti criss-cross is exactly the way you want it and you say Okay, I’m going to take your recommendation, that’s exactly what we’re going to do, and you go on. That’s an art form that took a long time to learn.\n\nWhen I was first Governor I made a lot of mistakes about doing private sector kind of decision-making rather than public sector kind of decision-making. We have a unique institution in New Hampshire called the Governor’s Council. It was always told to me that previous Governors hated it. I came into it hating it as an institution because I could make no decision without approval of council. No contract gets issued without—there’s a public meeting once a week, or maybe once every two weeks, two or three hundred items on the agenda. You go through them all, every contract in the state, every appointment in the state, every promotion in the state, and it has to have three votes out of five. There were days in which the council would vote no on everything the Governor asked for, so you’re stymied.\n\nI went to the council and suggested to them that it was really the Governor and the council against the legislature. I reminded them that we ought to work as an executive branch and in an effort to convince them—as you know, highway patronage is one of the great patronage tools in state politics. State legislatures put highways where significant legislators want them. I created, by fiat, the Governor’s highway commission, which consisted of the five councilors and the Governor, and we put a ten-year highway plan together, held public hearings around the state, got tremendous support for our highway plan. In essence dictated to the legislature where the highways were to go, gave these councilors whose only contribution in government was saying no an opportunity to say yes, and frankly, created a whole new working relationship with the council.\n\nI became the councilors’ favorite Governor. Some of them had served with three or four or five Governors and they just loved it. Frankly, I think it is one of the great tools in America now. It requires a public hearing for everything, it’s what keeps New Hampshire government so clean and open. If somebody is going to get a contract and some citizen doesn’t like it, they come to that hearing room and stand up and protest the contract. It’s agonizing to go through, but it’s an amazing system and I had to learn how to use it. I had to learn to be open. I had to learn to share power with these councilors. I had to learn that they care about their district and I’d better distribute my appointments accordingly.\n\nHargrove\n\nHow are they chosen?\n\nSununu\n\nThey are elected district wide. It’s the last vestige of colonialism, but boy, I think it is fantastic, I really do. The hardest job you have as Governor in my opinion is pardons, and the Governor and council approve the pardons. I have to tell you, nothing I did as Governor was harder than dealing with pardons. You don’t know whether you are being conned. You don’t know how to be empathetic. You don’t know how to be generous. You don’t know how to be tough. You don’t know how to be strict. But the council was in on that and we worked out a set of ground rules that made them comfortable and made me comfortable. But those were the kind of power sharing things in public life that I thought I had learned, that I was willing to take down there.\n\nAnd I also knew I liked this President. This was a guy I believed in, in terms of his capacity to make a difference in the word, whose agenda I agreed with, and who was sometimes just too nice a person to be President. I figured if I went down there I would have to serve a role in which I probably had to be the tough guy in the administration.\n\nHargrove\n\nDid he perceive that, do you think?\n\nMilkis\n\nDid you guys talk about that? The role of the Chief of Staff? What Sherman Adams did?\n\nSununu\n\nNo, but I did talk to every living Chief of Staff and I read Sherman Adams’ book. I came to the conclusion, I didn’t really sit down and discuss it with the President, the role of Chief of Staff is a very simple role, it is whatever the President wants it to be. If you want to be a good Chief of Staff, that’s what you go down to do, you do what the President wants you to do. Sometimes he tells you, sometimes you get it by osmosis. If you can’t do that, you leave. And there is nothing wrong with leaving.\n\nMilkis\n\nWith President Bush, did you get it mostly by osmosis since you didn’t really discuss this explicitly?\n\nSununu\n\nNo, we didn’t discuss that, but my relationship with the President, as Chief of Staff, was the following: I never, never freelanced a single thing, and he knew it and was comfortable with that. Now, in order to accomplish that I had to ask him questions, sometimes important questions, like, Are you for or against civil rights?\n\nMilkis\n\nWhat was the answer?\n\nSununu\n\nAnd sometimes trivial questions like, Can so and so use the tennis court? because we had a spat or something. But I asked him everything. We had our morning meeting, which we will get into, in which 90 percent was decided, and then probably 30, 40, 50 times a day I would go down the hall and ask him. Nothing was too important and nothing was too trivial. And I think he appreciated the fact that when I didn’t know, if it was trivial and I didn’t know, I didn’t guess. To this day I think he understands that there is not a single thing that I did as Chief of Staff that I freelanced. We never talked about it, but that was our implicit contract and the way we functioned.\n\nIt’s the same way I ran the campaign. I never put out stuff in the campaign, or Atwater never put out stuff, which we didn’t tell him. We got his feelings on things and tried to live with them. As I said earlier, when he draws the line, you don’t go beyond the line, and he had confidence in that. So that was basically it. I would go to him and say, I’m going to do this, and I’m going to do that. If he didn’t like it he’d tell me. If he didn’t care, you wouldn’t get an answer, just go ahead and do it, and if he did like it, really liked it, he might say, Do more of this. But it was always, always, always—the structure of the White House, the process in the White House was very simple, we did what the President wanted and we made sure we didn’t do what he didn’t want.\n\nI got that rule from having been Governor. I want my Chief of Staff or my staff to do what I want and I don’t want them to do what I don’t want. And if I put an envelope around something, don’t you dare step outside of it, because I, the elected official, have to report to the people and so on. That’s what your job is. And I really believe that the Cabinet officials should have functioned that way and so on. I also understood the problem of the executive and it is the following problem. If he doesn’t want to have coffee with Bob Mosbacher tomorrow, and he doesn’t mind Mosbacher knowing it, when Mosbacher calls and asks, he tells him, I can’t have coffee with you. But if he tells me, I can’t have coffee with Bob Mosbacher tomorrow, it means, Hey, I don’t want to have coffee with Bob Mosbacher and I don’t want Bob Mosbacher to know I don’t want to have coffee with him, so you get me out of this, and you take the blame.\n\nHe doesn’t say that, but that’s what the job is. I knew that, not because he said it, I knew that because I’d been Governor. And those are the kinds of things—I wanted to be the Chief of Staff to George Bush as I would have wanted the Chief of Staff to serve me. And that’s basic ground rules, and that’s basically—we never discussed it, never discussed process or personnel. There were some people he wanted in positions and so, by definition, they were there. He wanted [Marlin] Fitzwater to be his Press Secretary, he wanted Brent Scowcroft to be his National Security Advisor, he wanted John Tower to be Secretary of Defense, Jim Baker to be Secretary of State, Nick [Brady] to be at Treasury. But there were some he didn’t care about, so the process of selection came to him with recommendations.\n\nMilkis\n\nHow about your staff? Did you have carte blanche to put your own staff together?\n\nSununu\n\nAlmost. He wanted Tim McBride to be his aide to begin with. He wanted Gregg Petersmeyer to be in and so we found a position as director of Points of Light. There were some people he wanted to bring in and you don’t have any problem because frankly good people can do almost anything and you assume he’s going to appoint good people.\n\nYoung\n\nBoyden Gray was—\n\nSununu\n\nSure, Boyden was there by designation so to speak.\n\nHargrove\n\nRoger Porter told me that he had accepted the job in Treasury and you called him and asked him to come to the White House instead.\n\nSununu\n\nI really wanted somebody who’d been around a while to lead the domestic policy side because frankly, you’ll hear me say it over and over again, this President wanted certain results domestically and I wanted somebody who was smart enough to go and sit down and work out details. I knew the devil was in the details of the legislation. I’ll give you an anecdote: I got elected with a huge deficit in the state. I convinced the legislature that I was crazy enough that they should give me my budget because they were convinced it wasn’t going to work and didn’t want to share the blame with me.\n\nSo I’m convinced this budget is going to solve things, but I’m looking for insurance. New Hampshire had the lowest tobacco tax in New England. As you know, we have no sales tax or income tax in New Hampshire, so we have a lot of interest in revenue sources. We were tied with Vermont as the lowest tobacco tax and a lot of people used to come from out of state and buy tobacco in the state. I’m looking for insurance. The next highest state was about 20 cents a pack, we were 13. So as a rider I convinced the legislature to tack onto the appropriations bill, at the very last moment, two hours before I accepted what the committee in conference was going to bring in, a provision that said New Hampshire’s tobacco tax stays at 13 cents unless Vermont raises theirs, and up to 5 cents of increase in Vermont, we will match their increase. Now the Vermont legislature had adjourned and gone home, so they figured this Governor is insane.\n\nI knew Dick Snelling was smart and I knew Snelling was having revenue trouble, so I convinced them to put this in. I signed the bill. Two days later, I never talked to him, Snelling called his legislature back, raised the tobacco tax 5 cents and I had my insurance.\n\nMilkis\n\nBefore we proceed ahead with your role as Chief of Staff, we slid over the convention so quickly, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to put more that’s important on the record. Perhaps you would want to talk more about the Quayle selection and what followed—\n\nMasoud\n\nYour role in the convention.\n\nMilkis\n\nYou said you didn’t have a role in selecting him, but you certainly were there as a witness to the reaction.\n\nSununu\n\nI have to tell you, I think Dan Quayle is the smartest politician in terms of policy implementation, policy and dealing with in Congress and in America today, and I supported him for this nomination. I know he gets a bad rap in the press. I thought he was an excellent choice then. He was a great Vice President for the President. Again he brought to it all the loyalty that was important, but functionally he was a great Vice President for the President. When we had a problem in the House or the Senate, the go-to guy was Quayle. When we had a tough political discussion, the guy who got into it and said the hard things was Quayle.\n\nIt’s amazing to me that that is such a difficult thing today. I didn’t know him well, I had met him two or three times before he was selected. I was as surprised as everybody. I got the official call that it wasn’t me about an hour before the announcement—it wasn’t a surprise. Everybody got it like that. I wasn’t told who it was, watched it on television and then wandered down and met him after the nomination. I met him, I spent about two or three minutes with him just before that tough news conference and then a little time with him afterwards, and let it go at that.\n\nMasoud\n\nDid you play any role in the convention at all?\n\nSununu\n\nYes, I was in charge of the platform. I did the platform. And it was going to be a convention in which the press said the abortion issue was going to divide the Republican Party, that there was no way the Republican Party could take the Reagan position on abortion. Then there were four or five other issues. But I ran that and basically tried to run a hearings process down there in which you just let everybody talk themselves to death. We did that and got exactly the platform the President wanted.\n\nThe only issue we had trouble on was one foreign policy issue. It had to deal with missiles and one of those arcane missile issues but we finally worked that out in a back room as is always done, with some ambiguous language. I don’t remember what the issue was. John Tower had to come down and work out something with some of the Republicans who wanted something different. But basically, with everything else—\n\nAnd afterwards, one of the nice moments for me, because I was very strongly pro-life and the President wanted a strong pro-life client, is we got that with Nancy Johnson and Lowell Weicker, who were leading the charge against. They came up and thanked us all for the process and thought they had an opportunity to speak their say and didn’t feel it was stacked against them. They were gracious enough to go out and make those sentiments felt and it turned out to be a nothing issue at the convention. I talked to Lowell, I talked to Nancy, I talked to the others and said, If you tell me whom you want to speak to, as long as you don’t filibuster this thing to death, take all the time you want. You can raise any of the issues you want, you can have any motions you want. They gave me a list of about five or six and I said, Why don’t you combine these two? You know, we worked out the agenda ahead of time on how they would do it and what they would want. They got everything they asked for in terms of procedure and opportunity to raise it, and it just went smoothly.\n\nWe included all those things we talked about, the environmental commitment, the civil rights. I don’t remember the platform. But all these things that were supposedly so controversial, the President got exactly what he wanted and we moved on. I think that was another reason he felt very comfortable, because what was supposed to be a huge—the press was down there, ready to take prisoners and it turned out to be bland and dead.\n\nMasoud\n\nDo you have any insight into the President’s commitment to the pro-life position?\n\nSununu\n\nThe President came to his pro-life position late and is absolutely committed to it, and is committed to it primarily, I think, because of the death of his daughter. He says that, You know, if somebody had told us she was going to die early and we could have an abortion and avoid it, I would not have given up the opportunity to have her. I think it was a true, deep commitment. I think he is troubled by the political difficulty the commitment causes. He doesn’t like the conflict generated by that position, but there is no ambivalence on the position. We’ll get into it later. One of the toughest issues we had to sustain vetoes on were pro-life provisions—pro-choice, pro-life conflicts in legislation. He never lost a veto while I was Chief of Staff. He lost one after I left.\n\nMilkis\n\nWhat was that? Cable TV?\n\nSununu\n\nRight. But even with that loss, it is the most amazing veto sustaining record. Nobody ever had a record like that and I’m just irritated that two of his fat, soft, pitch down the middle—we could have figured out a way to do it. It may have cost a few equivalent license plates or something, but that veto should have been sustained. Just to keep a clean record. But his personal commitment to the issue is pretty strong and sincere and I have talked to him about it.\n\nYoung\n\nThe second convention.\n\nSununu\n\nI wasn’t there.\n\nYoung\n\nI know, but that was by contrast, very much of a contrast with the first.\n\nSununu\n\nLook, the President had a campaign run by the people who wanted to run the President’s campaign, and the majority of them would have trouble running a one-car funeral.\n\nMasoud\n\nGo back to the last question about Quayle, the last question I have about that. If you read the [Herbert] Parmet biography of President Bush, there is a quote from President Bush’s daily diary—\n\nSununu\n\nThat’s taken out of context. What the President was referring to was the mistake in the handling of the reaction after the selection. I know that. I can tell you that unequivocally.\n\nMasoud\n\nWould you care to elaborate, what did the President think should have been done and what was done incorrectly? Was it the surprise springing of the selection—\n\nSununu\n\nI don’t know whether he has an idea of what should have been done, I just think he obviously looks at eggs and eggshell on the floor and says, We shouldn’t have dropped the eggs.\n\nHargrove\n\nQuayle never recovered, I don’t think.\n\nSununu\n\nNo, I don’t think so. It really is part of the problem that he has and I think he would have recovered. I think it would have been an interesting race this time if he had had enough money to go through New Hampshire. I can tell you that I'm 99.9 percent sure he would have been endorsed by the Union Leader. I am 90 percent sure he would have won New Hampshire. He would have been [John] McCain in New Hampshire, with the advantage that he had an agenda and a philosophy and appeal to Republican voters which McCain did not have. McCain forgot he was running in a Republican primary and Quayle would have had that momentum going into South Carolina, which would have been ideal for him. So it could have been a very different structure. The only way he could overcome the image of not winning was by winning and that’s what would have had to happen there.\n\nMilkis\n\nCan we go back to the—\n\nMasoud\n\nEntering the administration?\n\nHargrove\n\nI had one question which I forgot to ask you. When the administration was putting together the White House office and the Cabinet, was there much discussion about the relationship between the White House and the Cabinet, whether in this administration there was going to be more emphasis on the Cabinet than previous ones?\n\nSununu\n\nThose things don’t get discussed. I don’t care who, in retrospect, ever tells you those were discussed, they’re not. What you’re interested in doing at that time is getting people that have talent to serve in the office, loyalty to the President and a similar agenda, at least a sufficient overlap in the agenda that it is tolerable. I mentioned some of the positions that were kind of lined up. The hard position—HHS [Health and Human Services] was very hard. The President wanted Lou Sullivan. Lou was going to be in charge of the agency that would have the greatest impact on the pro-life, pro-choice issue.\n\nLou had never been involved in politics, did not understand that the press would take three words of a phrase to make him believe the story, and so, trying not to appear dogmatic on a couple of presentations, he made it sound like he was waffling on the life issue and all the conservative groups got up in arms. I had to go and talk to Lou and see where he really stood, then convey that to the conservative groups. I finally got that calmed down and got him to the point where conservative Republicans in Congress, in the Senate, gave him their approval and support. But those are the kinds of things you go through, not, What is our general philosophy of interacting with the Cabinet?\n\nQuayle and I lobbied very hard for [Jack] Kemp and [William] Bennett, because I really wanted the President to have a comfort factor with the conservative wing of the party, and he had no problem with accepting it. He was a little bit concerned about Kemp and probably rightly so, but I thought we could handle Kemp and we did for the most part up until the end. Trying to remember some other Cabinet—what were the tough Cabinet questions.\n\nHe had Lynn Martin and Mrs. [Elizabeth] Dole, to provide some women in the Cabinet. He had black representation in the Cabinet. I mean he really was a President who believed in both being and being seen as being an administration that was open.\n\nMasoud\n\nEducation, was that—\n\nSununu\n\nLauro [Cavazos] was a hold over. The President wanted to hold it open. What happened? Let’s follow that down to its completion. Lauro never was ready to take the lead on some of the transitional things that the President wanted to do on education. He wanted to talk about and focus on K through 12. Lauro had come out of the university environment at Tufts with me. I knew Lauro from Tufts. He was Dean of the Dental School while I was Associate Dean of the College of Engineering. Eventually the President kind of felt Lauro wasn’t doing a good job and I had to convey to my old friend the fact that the President wanted his resignation. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Lauro got very upset. From that meeting to this day I have not seen Lauro Cavazos.\n\nMasoud\n\nWas this just a general impression the President had built up over time or was there a precipitating incident?\n\nSununu\n\nNo, it wasn’t an incident, it was a lack of incidents, a lack of—we wanted to have the education summit, we wanted to do a couple of things and lead with them. Lauro would put out news releases but not create the resonance that the President wanted on the issue and didn’t pick up the slack on education, and it was an issue the President cared a lot about. And Lauro—look, Presidents don’t come to those conclusions alone. Roger Porter had a disillusionment with him. The domestic policy group wasn’t getting out of Lauro what they thought they had to deliver for the President on education so they conveyed their feelings.\n\nYou know, the President doesn’t sit alone in a corner and say, I need a replacement. He gets a consensus of feeling, so that he finally says, You know, you’re right, we have to get somebody else. So we went out and got Lamar [Alexander] and recommended him to the President. The President met with Lamar, he knew Lamar. Lamar was aggressive and articulate on education and I think did a great job.\n\nMasoud\n\nWhen you were appointed Chief of Staff, was there any going over of flow charts and thinking about how you wanted to organize the White House staff?\n\nSununu\n\nNo, the White House staff is organized the way the President wants it to be. But it must evolve, because the President doesn’t know day one what he wants the structure to really be. So you start with a structure and you curve it slightly as you go along. What we did know was the general organization of the Reagan White House in terms of major responsibilities.\n\nThe Reagan White House had a troika. Jimmy Baker didn’t become Chief of Staff until about the last year of the first term. He was only Chief of Staff for ten or eleven months before he switched with Don Regan at the end of the first term, he became Secretary of Treasury and Regan became his Chief of Staff. But it was [Edwin] Meese, [Michael] Deaver and Baker. And I think the President knew that that’s not what he wanted. He saw all the problems that caused, the infighting. That’s why I can tell you that troika of Fuller and Deaver had no chance.\n\nSo he knew he wanted a Chief of Staff. He knew he was going to have to have someone limit flow, because there is no way he can do everything. So he, I think, picked two people he trusted. That he felt would not alter his agenda and would do only what he wanted done and not do what he did not want done. That’s why Scowcroft and I—the major component was Scowcroft’s selection and my appointment, and then from that, the next layer was basically the same as the next layer in all administrations before that, the Press Secretary, somebody in charge of communications, somebody in charge of the Counsel’s office, somebody in charge of the administration of the White House, I forget that whole list but you can go through it. So that was it.\n\nNow, did the President have in mind that everything would go through the Chief of Staff? I don’t think he ever thought about it. I recognized my responsibility to the President to make sure that what he wanted got done and what he didn’t want to get done didn’t get done. There was only one way I felt that that could happen, and that was to have everything come through a single point. My Deputy Chief of Staff was Andy Card, somebody who’d been with the President all along, whom the President trusted implicitly and whom I trusted implicitly. So basically I said, Look, we’re going to have to handle it. If we can’t, we’ll add in this office. But everything will have to come through this office.\n\nRemember, in a White House, what you have to do is negotiate competing interests. The Secretary of Treasury wants this, and HUD [Housing and Urban Development] wants that, and you have to negotiate the difference. The last thing in the world you want to do is take every tough decision and have the Secretary of Treasury sit here and the Secretary of HUD sit here and the President have to say, I’m with you on this one and I’m with you on that one. You find out what the President wants the result to be and then you make the result go to where he wants it. The only way you can guarantee that is by requiring all decisions to come to the place that knows what the President wants.\n\nNow, if the President wants to share his feelings with ten, twelve, fifteen people, that’s one thing, but that wasn’t this President’s style. Because if you’re sharing your feelings with ten or twelve people, this guy will know that the President picked him this time and the President picked him that time or her this time and that lady that time. You can’t do that. The art of the job is to make sure the President gets credit for everything good that happens and everything that everybody is happy about, and to make sure that everything that everybody is angry about is blamed on the Chief of Staff. That is the job.\n\nMilkis\n\nAnd this is the job you wanted?\n\nSununu\n\nIf you’re really going to take a chunk of your life and go through the agony of the job, you want to do something important, and that’s how you do something important, and yes, that is.\n\nMilkis\n\nDid you have any sense of—you knew you were going to make enemies.\n\nSununu\n\nI suspected I’d be there six months. I think I figured out the half-life of the Chief of Staff was ten and a half months. Baker was there a year. Sherm Adams was actually the most successful Chief of Staff, he was there over a term. But after Sherm Adams, I don’t think anybody was there over two years and I think the half-life is about eleven months. I figured I would be there about six months. I thought I could get everything organized and everything put in place correctly and a process that would have some momentum, and, if I got lucky, a little longer. But I knew the definition of the job was that eventually, unless I got awfully, awfully lucky, somebody else would be in there. That’s history. You resign yourself to that and go on.\n\nHargrove\n\nYou are the custodian of the President’s choices in the sense that you want to be sure he heard a diversity of points of view.\n\nSununu\n\nOh yes, right.\n\nHargrove\n\nBut to what degree can somebody in a job like that also be an advocate for positions?\n\nSununu\n\nTo the degree you can get away with it, and the President lets you get away with it, and the President wants you to get away with it. Look, this President knew that I came with some very strong feelings about issues. New Hampshire had been the first state to pass acid rain legislation—he knew that I had a commitment to the environment, but in a way that was consistent with his commitment. You do good environmental things without destroying the economy and you don’t let environmental issues become surrogates for anti-growth.\n\nHe knew I had very strong feelings on education, that the keystone to education is the parent-teacher-student relationship, and he believed in it, and that money is not a solution to education. He heard all the statistics, that if you really do a statistical analysis of performance and funding in education, for other reasons, you will find an absolutely negative correlation. Why? Because the most expensive schools are in New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles, where the results are lousy. It is for other reasons, but if you just do a statistical correlation, you can’t convince yourself that money solves education. That there is an incentive process and in parental control, he’d like that educational policy.\n\nOn issues of energy, America ought to become more energy independent, that deregulation was hurting the system. He liked where I was coming from. So on the issues that he felt I might stick my nose into with a personal agenda, it was his agenda and he knew that where he told me no, I wouldn’t do it. So I wasn’t doing anything he didn’t want done and I wasn’t doing anything in a broad sense that wasn’t the process he wanted.\n\nHargrove\n\nThe press sometimes didn’t get that right, for example, global warming. Here’s this scientist who thinks he knows everything and he cuts this off, don’t you remember the stories? They were unfavorable.\n\nSununu\n\nSure I do, and let me tell you how silly it was. I asked the global warming people to come in. They said, We have these predictions from these computer models. I said, Gee, I like modeling, let’s talk about it. They had these two-dimensional weather models that were designed primarily for short-term predictions that they were using for long-range predictions. Now, I raised one issue. I said, Gee, global warming is associated with the thermal response of the atmosphere. There is a thermal capacity of the atmosphere. Let me do a calculation. I said, Gee, how is this model coupled to the oceans? Well, it’s not. I said, Gee, the thermal capacity of the top meter of the ocean is equal to the thermal capacity of the entire atmosphere. Now, we know the top hundred meters of the ocean are well coupled thermally to the atmosphere, so you are ignoring something which dominates by a factor of 100 the thermal response of the system.\n\nThose idiots put out that I thought that by putting a simple one-dimensional model that included the ocean, it was as good as theirs. The point was, their model was garbage. And garbage in, garbage out. I said, You want us to make trillion dollar decisions based on using the wrong model to do the wrong thing and ignoring the most significant parameter? Now, they have since put models in there, but they don’t know which is cause and effect. But that’s the kind of discussion we would have. In Washington, if you force somebody to get to the point where they admit they don’t know what they are talking about, they merely attack the one who has asked the question. That’s what happened on global warming.\n\nBy the way, [James] Hanson has since changed his mind on global warming, and that was the original NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] scientist that pushed it. I haven’t pursued the global warming issue. I saw something very interesting about six months ago which correlates the droughts and the hot spells in the country to the sunspot cycle, and we are going through the worst sunspot cycle in ages now. But my point was, you don’t make trillion dollar decisions using hoaxed up models. And we increased the funding for global warming studies by—again I’m not sure of the number—I think three hundred million dollars, saying that if you’re going to make these decisions, you ought to know what you’re doing. There was never immediacy. You know, you ought to do something but you didn’t have to do it in a year or ten years, you had to do something, sometime, if it would change. And you would ask such simple questions as, Gee, the bulk of the heating in this century occurred before the emissions got too high. Well, you’re not supposed to ask those questions.\n\nSo, yes, on the wetlands there was an issue of no net loss. The law was written and the congressional history of the legislation that had no net loss in it discussed the fact that compensatory provisions would be allowed. That if you took this piece of wetland, you could go and create a compensating piece of wetland. But the environmentalists and [Bill] Reilly wanted to write regulations in which the compensatory piece was not permitted. But when you questioned that, you were accused of being anti-environment.\n\nI knew that the President’s feeling was that if the law said compensatory, you included compensatory. And he wanted somebody to go and argue his position and maintain his position. He didn’t mind anybody fighting for his position. Whether it happened at the Chief of Staff level or Roger Porter—and Roger did a wonderful job in dealing with these issues—or their staff, or the congressional staff going to Congress, didn’t make any difference. It had to be dealt with by his White House, and if I happened to have enough interest and experience in an issue that I could argue it, he never minded that, never minded that at all.\n\nMasoud\n\nWhat were some of the other issues that you took a special interest in?\n\nSununu\n\nWell, let me do it this way. This President, as I said earlier, got more domestic legislation passed by a factor of ten to President Clinton and more than, I think, any other President except Roosevelt’s first term, and, if you want, the all encompassing one or two pieces of legislation that Lyndon Johnson got passed for the Great Society. He passed a clean air bill that had been stalemated for thirteen years and did it in such a way that it has worked magic. I’m talking about the childcare bill that was based on vouchers and built into the legislation. The civil rights bill—his way. A crime bill that really was the first comprehensive bill that started to recognize the focusing of resources back to the communities with discretionary spending by the communities. Energy deregulation, which is the heart and soul of the reduction in energy costs in this country, electric bills going down and so on. An agriculture reform bill that for the first time made significant reductions in the subsidies without hurting the family farmer. The Americans with Disabilities Act, a piece of legislation that as originally drafted was absolutely impossible to administer and the President said, Go in and fix it, and he got it done his way for the most part.\n\nEven in the heated budget bill, we restructured the congressional budgeting structure with constraints that put discipline into the system that is still there. And, in fact, I was reading the material you sent me, I’m quoted in an article saying that with this, by about 1993 or 1994 there’d be a $65 or $70 billion surplus, so I was off by about $20 billion.\n\nHargrove\n\nNow, in many of these cases he worked with Democrats in the Congress?\n\nSununu\n\nSure, he had to.\n\nHargrove\n\nNecessarily.\n\nSununu\n\nA hundred and seventy-four members of the House and forty-five members of the Senate were Republicans.\n\nMilkis\n\nHistoric lows.\n\nSununu\n\nHistoric lows. To work the legislation agenda he wanted, domestic legislation agenda he wanted, it included the first chunks of welfare reform, which were very important. It included an expansion of the responsibilities for decisions to the states being devolved from the federal government, the federalism aspect. Certainly the legislation on fixing savings and loans fast, and taking the political consequences. That was his domestic agenda that was passed. When I asked the Clinton people what their domestic agenda is, they point to two bills, the Family Leave Act and the tax increase in ’93. They don’t call it that. But that is what Bill Clinton has managed. He has signed, after vetoing twice, the welfare reform bill, but that’s not his bill.\n\nHargrove\n\nNo.\n\nSununu\n\nHe didn’t craft it. So I maintain that George Bush has had the best domestic record of any modern Presidency, and doesn’t receive credit for it.\n\nHargrove\n\nWere there disappointments, particularly in dealing with the Democrats?\n\nSununu\n\nThere were nuance disappointments in the legislation. We would have liked to have fixed the budget issue better. On the tax side, we were disappointed in not getting a capital gains tax cut. I’m trying to remember what else, you tell me.\n\nMilkis\n\nWere there any concerns about the Clean Air Act agencies, nuance disappointments?\n\nSununu\n\nThere were nuance disappointments, but the biggest problem with the Clean Air Act was the rules and regulations written, trying to be written by EPA [Environmental Protection Association] to recapture what had not been included in the legislation. The Clean Air Act as it finally came out was a pretty good bill. It included provisions—you know the market trading on emissions, which is probably one of the best things we ever did and something that Porter and I just fought Congress for the President’s sake over and over and over on and finally got in there. It was estimated—again, my numbers may be wrong—but it was estimated that to get a ton of emissions would cost a thousand dollars and they were traded at about a thousand dollars. I think they’re trading at eighty dollars or ninety dollars now, because it has really shoved the reduction of the emissions into the cheapest solutions, and so we are getting a tremendous bang for our buck nationally out of the Clean Air Act. The deregulation on electricity—big, big—undid some of the constraints that had been imposed by PERPA [Political, Economic Reporting and Public Affairs] under the Carter administration. The President knew the energy side cold.\n\nDisappointments? He was very disappointed in not being able to do anything about ANWR [Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] and opening up the mineral exploration to some of the areas that had been shut off. I think he really sensed that the country was cutting itself off in the long run from being a major oil and gas producer to some extent, and that we were tying our hands unnecessarily, that technology was there to do things in an environmentally sound way and we were just reacting and over-reacting. I think that was a disappointment.\n\nHargrove\n\nYou think you won on civil rights? All of the fuss about quotas and so on, or was it really just a—\n\nSununu\n\nI have to tell you, that is the hardest issue for me to judge, because it is a lawyer’s gambit issue. I tried very hard to understand the nuance of the language that [Richard] Thornburgh and Boyden [Gray] were battling for. Let me tell you something interesting. I developed a group of very interesting friends. Probably one of my closest friends in the Senate now is Ted Kennedy, and we battled civil rights and ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] to a fare-thee-well, some real shouting matches and so on. But he always came prepared, he always knew what he was talking about, and he always knew enough about the issue to try and sucker you into winning. And I don’t have a problem with that.\n\nI bring that up in this context because it was a language issue. Ted would always come with two or three variations of the language and he understood how to play with the words to try and win it. And I respect—I have no problem, absolutely no problem with it. I never understood all the nuances involved in every perturbation of that language. Boyden finally told us that they had come up with some language that made it a non-quota bill. And that’s what the whole battle was—to have language that would not be interpreted by the courts as allowing a quota structure to be implemented in the system.\n\nI have since been told by some folks like [Bradford] Reynolds that maybe the language wasn’t everything that we thought it was, but at the time we thought we got what we wanted, we thought we found a compromise that made sense. I don’t know the answer. It is the one piece of legislation, I have to admit, that is going to be decided by legal nuances that I don’t understand.\n\nMcCall\n\nI’m going to actually ask the same question. We’re talking a lot about—\n\nSununu\n\nExcuse me, let me just go back to that point, because if there is something that I am going to keep emphasizing, it is how successful Bush was domestically.\n\nMasoud\n\nAnd we have a lot of questions to follow up—\n\nSununu\n\nAnd to me, the most important contribution you can make on the historical side is to help us identify the factual basis associated with all of that.\n\nMcCall\n\nThis actually goes into that. What we want to ask is, we’re talking about the individual trees in the forest of the domestic policy. Clean Air, ADA, et cetera.\n\nSununu\n\nYes.\n\nMcCall\n\nWhat I want to get into a little bit is the rhyme and reason to it. You talk a little bit about divining what the President’s intent was in terms of what his agenda was, in terms of individual policies. Did you ever figure going in, about where this was coming from, where his priorities were going to be and why? For instance, why ADA? You talked a little bit about abortion and a couple of other things—\n\nSununu\n\nThis is a President that believes in a set—and it is very much reflected in what George W. is doing—of fundamental conservative principles of minimizing government involvement, of free market, capitalism-oriented economy, of an unleashing of the growth potential of the country, of not over constraining it, of fixing problems, and of a kinder, gentler (remember that phrase?) set of policies that deal with individual needs and recognizing that different people have different needs. That was the President’s broad philosophy. It is embodied in what we did in the Clean Air Act, fixing the environment without handcuffing the economy. It is embodied in what we did in the energy bill—deregulating so prices are cut without creating a system that destroys the strength of the energy-producing side of the country. It is embodied in ADA, recognizing that a segment of our society wasn’t able to participate because of handicaps and trying to give them an avenue to participate without creating a club or a sword that is used to hamper the capacity of the private sector to function.\n\nA civil rights bill that addresses a slice of a problem that was not addressed by previous legislation but does it in a way that doesn’t create this quota structure that is anti-growth, anti-expansion and anti-fair, that combination of commitment to minimizing the role of government while using government just enough to protect the rights of individuals and to help people as individuals.\n\nMcCall\n\nWhere does the resonance issue come in—one of the problems has been, in talking about the Bush domestic record, is it wasn’t always that—\n\nSununu\n\nBut it’s all woven together, it really is. It’s woven together on the economic strength and opportunities side. The Clean Air Act fixes a problem while keeping the economy strong. The energy act does the same thing. ADA takes care of a personal need without going so far as to have an unintended consequence associated with it. Same thing with the Civil Rights Act. All of them are designed to solve problems, but have in them a recognition that you can over-empower government and begin to have unintended consequences. Go and fight that the change is taken right to the line and no further. And he took unfinished issues—the Clean Air bill had been hanging there thirteen or fourteen years: Go do it. We can do this, we can make it work, we can meet our own conditions and find a compromise with Congress that meets our agenda and their agenda. I think that’s the theme. He took all these unfinished issues and really brought them to a head and closed.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd all of them were done with Democratic majorities.\n\nSununu\n\nAll of them were done with huge Democratic majorities, run by two nice men, Foley and Mitchell, who were the most partisan congressional leaders the country has ever seen. Absolutely partisan. No question in my mind that George Mitchell created an environment that allowed Bill Clinton to win by being so partisan.\n\nYoung\n\nThat also has something to do presumably with the passage of legislation and statutes.\n\nSununu\n\nOh yes, but most of that was done with committee chairmen.\n\nYoung\n\nI’d love to get into how it was done, because one of the questions that you put your finger on—\n\nHargrove\n\nCould I ask a question before that that might be germane?\n\nYoung\n\n—is that you have an opposition Congress, and a very effective domestic policy, which I think is already more recognized than you realize.\n\nHargrove\n\nYou remember Jimmy Carter was criticized for being too diffuse, not having priorities. The Reagan people learned from that to do a few things. Did the Bush people have a first year strategy?\n\nSununu\n\nYes. The first year strategy for the President was to do what had to be done, to take advantage of what was happening in the Soviet Union. That was his absolute first priority.\n\nHargrove\n\nOkay.\n\nSununu\n\nThere is no question about that. But on the domestic side, there were two things that were a priority: Number one, let’s start doing something about the budget and the deficit, had to get a hold of that. And number two, start to create the interactions on issues like clean air, like energy deregulation, like the crime bill, like civil rights and ADA, that gets us to the point where we get them passed. We may not pass them this year, but you have to start this year. And we started getting our groups together in the White House and in the departments and the agencies developing those themes. I had many meetings with Reilly trying to define the envelope in which the environmental legislation would be acceptable. Many meetings re-defining the envelope in which the environmental legislation would be acceptable, and then a follow up meeting defining the envelope in which environmental legislation would be acceptable. That was his agenda, and it was clear, and we were trying to do it all at the same time.\n\nKaraagac\n\nYou talk about Boyden Gray’s and Thornburgh’s finessing of the issues in legal terms—\n\nSununu\n\nIt was only five words. That whole legislation was tied up over five words and I don’t remember what they were.\n\nKaraagac\n\nBusiness necessity was one of them—\n\nSununu\n\nYes, business necessity and how you define it, but five words. So it was finding a phrase to replace this handful of words that were battled over that met everybody’s needs. I mean, 40 pages of legislation and five words is the fight. So they would propose the cat is big and we would say the dog is small and you go back and forth, and I don’t know the difference between the cat is big and the dog is small. I’ve got to get the five civil rights lawyers at the Justice Department to come in and parse it. You ask the question nine times and you get nine slightly same, but slightly different answers, and so you say, Boyden, go up and do it. I can’t sit there.\n\nI mean, I would go there when they had an impasse and I’d sit down with Kennedy and I’d say, Senator, let’s try and do this, but I could never do it without either Boyden or Thornburgh at my side. I’m smart enough to know what I don’t know. And so they would say da-da and I would very modestly turn to Thornburgh and say, Dick. And they would come back and Kennedy’s guys would say, Don’t you understand this and this and this? And I’d say, Dick, can you do this. I mean, you try and negotiate it. You try awfully hard to do it. And then you pass papers back and forth. But we were negotiating five words.\n\nKaraagac\n\nIn some sense is that symptomatic of something about the Bush administration, that you people passed a lot of really technically accomplished and sophisticated things that somehow were in some ways perhaps, hard to mesh with the larger presidential agenda?\n\nSununu\n\nIt’s because we were overshadowed by two minor events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Gulf War. I mean, that’s not hard to imagine. Heaven forbid that as important as ADA was, that ADA becomes more visible than the collapse of the Soviet Union. I mean, that’s what it comes down to. And by the way, the President wasn’t just witnessing the collapse of the Soviet Union, and we’ll go into that in a while, this was an artfully managed, tempered, controlled, hour-by-hour reaction, determined process. And so that took a lot of time.\n\nThe amazing thing is that while the Soviet Union is being artfully taken apart, you are putting together the resources that did two things. One, addressed the immediate need of saying this aggression will not stand, and getting Saddam [Hussein] out of Kuwait, and number two, never talked about any more, eliminating forever the post Vietnam syndrome. Where would the world be today with one superpower hobbled by a perception in the world that the country is unwilling or unable to project power? That is the most important single result of the Gulf War; that a single superpower no longer is perceived by every tinhorn in the world as being unable to project power. The world could not function as it is functioning today if there had not been the Gulf War. And that’s why all these domestic issues, probably rightly so, took second and third seat. But second and third seat, if you put a play on Broadway and it’s second to Hamlet, it’s not bad.\n\nMasoud\n\nThe interesting question here as you described it, the very impressive domestic agenda, but—\n\nSununu\n\nDomestic performance. Everybody can have a good domestic agenda, not everybody can have good domestic performance.\n\nMasoud\n\nWhy didn’t anybody know about this, though?\n\nSununu\n\nBecause as I said, for the election, because it was written by the wusses of Wash"
