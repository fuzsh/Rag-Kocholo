It is also the only federal court named specifically in the Constitution, which states that,\n\n“The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court.”\n\nBeyond that, however, the Constitution tells us little about the make-up or organization of the court; it gives no qualifications for holding seats on the court, and doesn’t establish how many justices will be on the court."
