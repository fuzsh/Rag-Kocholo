        "text": "If I could briefly describe 2019 with respect to the year in science traveling it would be – Started with a “C.” Mostly this was in a good way, but unfortunately it also includes cancellation. While I still had a great traveling year, it didn’t go quite the way I expected.\n\nAs with 2018, 2019 got off to a slow start. The first two weeks of January shuffled in with a commitment to jury duty, which didn’t actually result in me sitting on a jury, but nevertheless blocked out that period of time from doing anything else. I made up for it by going to Costa Rica the end of the month for nine days, a fun trip that gave me plenty to write about. February and March once again kept me local with Lincoln-related events, including participation in the annual ALI Symposium at Ford’s Theatre.\n\nIn April I merged my Lincoln and travel with another “C” location – Charleston, South Carolina. There I saw Fort Sumter, the harbor fort where a bombardment by Confederate cannons marked the official start of the Civil War. I also visited the Hunley, a Confederate submarine that was lost immediately after sinking a Union ship and only recently recovered and is being restored. Then there was the die-hard Confederate.\n\nMay started with a visit to the U.S. Capitol Building where the Lincoln Group of DC helped officially dedicate the “Lincoln Room” where Abraham Lincoln used to hang out between sessions during his one term as a U.S. Congressman. The end of May took me to another “C” – Cuba. Such a fascinating country with limited opportunities for Americans to visit, especially since four days after our return the current administration applied even more stringent roadblocks.\n\nJune started a rather trying few months. Mid-month I headed out for my Chasing Abraham Lincoln, Part 3 road trip (another “C”). After stops in Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana I made my way into Illinois for a week of exploring Lincoln sites. One highlight of the trip was to join the Looking for Lincoln crew for their LEAD: Spirit of Lincoln Youth Academy. The LEAD group has given my book to all the participants (40 students and 8 mentors) for the last two years and this year they asked me to speak to them directly about leadership. The trip went well, including a foray into Wisconsin, but ended abruptly. I found out my father had gone into the hospital; ten days later he passed away. I spent the end of June and early July on a road trip up to Massachusetts for his funeral. Three months later my uncle, who had been a pillar of strength for the family at my Dad’s passing, had suddenly passed away himself, a victim of the rare disease, EEE.\n\nJuly and August were light on travel, in part because of local commitments and the need to do more writing. September took us to Chicago (there’s that “C” again) for several Lincoln-related activities and the chance to see the musical Hamilton. October and November were light until mid-month when I attended the annual Lincoln Forum in Gettysburg, PA.\n\nThen there was an unexpected “C.” We had booked a Caribbean Cruise on Windstar many months in advance and were looking forward to two weeks in such places as Curacao, Colombia, and Colon, Panama, in addition to other Caribbean islands. But those “C”s were enough it seems; literally one week before our departure I received an email saying the ship had major engine trouble and would be forced out of service – the trip was Cancelled. We were not amused. So instead of being warm and toasty sipping tropical drinks on the deck of a sailing ship in the Caribbean, we drove to Massachusetts and huddled over hot cocoa for a chilly Thanksgiving with my mother and other family. It was great to join my Mom for her first Thanksgiving since my Dad’s passing, but it wasn’t even a “C” location. There were plenty of other “C”s, including a trip to Coatesville (PA), some Civil War stops, and Ru’s multiple trips to China.\n\nOverall, 2019 was much less than I had anticipated but still reasonably busy with science traveling. The 2020 travel prospects are the most uncertain we’ve had in years. As of now there is absolutely nothing booked and only some general plans for what we want to do. With some key decisions up in the air, we’ll have to wait a few weeks more before deciding where to go, or even if we can go, or if alternative plans are necessary to go. While I admit that sounds rather cryptic, I’m hedging because there is a great deal of uncertainly extant, plus I don’t want to jinx things that are in the works. You’ll have to check back later for something more concrete. I promise to post a further update when I can.\n\nUntil then, happy traveling.\n\nDavid J.

I was incredibly busy this year even though I finished no new books. As I look back on what I wrote for 2018, I realize that 2019 was also transitional. Whether that can be considered good or not is debatable.\n\nThis was the second year in a row with nothing new in the bookstores. I’ve been writing, and writing a lot, but too often spread out on several new ideas along with the current work(s) in progress. That’s great for creativity, not so great for finishing any individual project. More on that shortly.\n\nMy three previously published books (not counting the two e-books) hit a wall in 2019, in part due to a private equity firm buying out Barnes and Noble stores and taking them private. Like many brick-and-mortar stores, B&N has been struggling to compete against online booksellers and secondary sellers via the likes of Amazon and eBay. No longer publicly traded, the new CEO of B&N is rethinking how their stores work. They probably will close some locations and retool others, much like the new CEO did when he took over the British bookseller Waterstones. So why does this affect me? Mainly because my publisher is affiliated with B&N and has effectively been put on hold while B&N figures out its future. The stock of my books is essentially frozen: no new printings, limited numbers of books in stores and in the warehouse, and stiff competition from those secondary sellers (for which I receive zero benefit). I did sell some additional foreign rights, but at this point I need new books on the market to maintain even a semblance of royalties.\n\nMy writing life was busy in other respects. I was the keynote speaker at the annual Lincoln-Thomas Day commemoration at Fort Stevens in Washington, D.C. in September. I co-instructed a “Lincoln’s Campaign for the Nomination, 1859-60” at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church. And I attended the LEAD: Spirit of Lincoln Youth Academy in Illinois. The LEAD group has given all of the students in the program a copy of my book for the last two years; this year they asked me to come out and speak to them directly.\n\nI also was interviewed and/or mentioned in a variety of outlets in 2019. One 8th grader interviewed me on Lincoln and Emancipation (this was my fourth such interview by students, the first three about Tesla). I was also interviewed on Facebook Live by filmmaker Annabel Park, mentioned in online and print articles, and even made the acknowledgements of a prominent scientist’s book.\n\nWhile no books made it out the door, my writing appeared in print. Two book reviews were published in Civil War Times magazine. Eight book reviews were published in The Lincolnian. I also entered three writing contests (two didn’t win and one is still in review).\n\nSo what is the plan for 2020?\n\nOver the last few months I’ve refocused my writing with the goal of finishing my long-researched new Lincoln book. That is my main objective in 2020, but it isn’t my only one. I’m also now in the initial planning stages of a collaborative travel perspective book that should be fleshed out in the coming month. I have several other books I had been working on piecemeal; the goal is to keep one of them moving while likely punting on the others until 2021.\n\nIn addition I will be putting more emphasis on magazine publishing in 2020. I plan to do more book reviews for Civil War Times, the Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, and the Lincoln Herald. I’ll also be pitching longer format articles for these journals and, for other magazines, non-Lincoln topics. The goal is to pitch two ideas a month while also entering one writing contest per month.\n\nMy speaking schedule increased in 2019 and will increase more in 2020 (and even more in 2021 when I expect to be doing a book tour). When I’m not writing or preparing talks I’ll continue with my 75 books per year reading schedule. If I can squeeze it in, I’ll also get back to developing my photography skills.\n\nAll this means is 1) 2020 will be a busy year, and 2) I’ll have to be more efficient than I was in 2019. One thing is certain: I love this writing life.\n\nHappy New Year to all!\n\nDavid J.

My average number of new books acquired has been a fairly consistent 58 books over each of the last five years. This year was 82. While that’s a big jump from my average, it still falls short of the 98 I acquired back in 2013.\n\nPart of the reason was that I started receiving books from publishers because of my book reviews. I write two book reviews per quarter (eight per year) for The Lincolnian, the Lincoln Group of DC‘s newsletter. I’ve also had two reviews published in Civil War Times this past year and expect to have more next year. The magazines, journals, and newspapers in which I publish reviews should expand in 2020. I also received books as part of my responsibilities for the Abraham Lincoln Institute book award evaluation committee. Still, most of the books I purchase through various bookselling outlets, including the onsite bookstore at the annual Lincoln Forum.\n\nOf the total acquired in 2019, 18 are new books published this year. Ten books on the list are signed, most directly to me by the author (e.g., during this year’s Lincoln Forum or when they are guest speakers for the Lincoln Group of DC’s monthly dinners). While many of the books are new, most go back in time. The oldest acquired this year is a 1944 pamphlet style book by Isaac Frost comparing Oliver Cromwell and Abraham Lincoln. The next oldest is a classic book by Lincoln scholar J.G. Randall called Lincoln: The Liberal Statesman, published in 1947. There are also important reference works like Fehrenbacher’s Recollected Words of Abraham Lincoln and Boritt’s book of Lincoln quotations.\n\nWith over 15,000 books on Lincoln extant, this seemed to be the year for books on peripheral figures close to Lincoln. Newspapermen were well covered, including books on Horace Greeley, Charles A. Dana, Noah Brooks, and Lincoln’s private secretary, John G. Nicolay. Books ranged from blockbuster’s like Sidney Blumenthal’s All The Powers of Earth to the lesser known but important Timothy Good’s We Saw Lincoln Shot. Books also covered Abe’s Youth in Indiana and Lincoln and the Blackhawk War in Illinois. On the more technical side was the most recent assessment of Lincoln’s use of Euclid in his speeches by David Hirsch and Dan Van Haften called The Tyranny of Public Discourse.\n\nSince I’m a big fan of both, one of my favorite books acquired this year is Abraham Lincoln Crossword Puzzles, although I have as yet not figured out how to do the puzzles but leave the book unblemished.\n\nCollecting all these books means I do a lot of reading. While I can’t claim to have read all of them, I have read many of them and plan to read the rest over time. And, of course, acquire even more. Note to publishers: I’m always open to receiving books in return for an honest review via my various venues, including Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nSee the 2019 list showing author/title/publication date below my signature blurb below.\n\nDavid J.

She would go on to become one of the most broken-hearted, and often reviled, women in history.\n\nThe fourth of seven children, Mary Todd was born into a wealthy slave-holding family. Her mother died when she was only 6 years old. Within two years her father, Robert Smith Todd, remarried and had another nine children with his new wife. Mary Todd and her siblings all had difficult relationships with their stepmother, who essentially ignored them while favoring her own growing brood. Despite these difficulties, Mary grew up in comfort and privilege. The celebrated statesman Henry Clay owned a plantation called Ashland down the road from the Todd household. When she was 13, Mary rode her new pony to Ashland, and Clay, the perennial presidential candidate, noted to his guests, “If I am ever President I shall expect Mary Todd to be one of my first guests.” The precocious Mary said she would enjoy living in the White House.\n\nRobert Todd was rather progressive for a nineteenth-century southern slave owner, and he encouraged his daughters as well as sons to get an education. In part because her stepmother wanted her out of the way, 14-year-old Mary was sent to live at Madame Mantelle’s finishing school for young ladies. There she received a classical education that concentrated on French and literature. She became fluent in French and also studied dance, drama, music, and, of course, the social graces needed to attract a suitable husband. Unlike most women of the time, she also took a keen interest in politics, becoming both knowledgeable and ambitious—and Whiggish. But like all women, politically she had to live vicariously through her husband.\n\nIn the fall of 1839 Mary moved from Kentucky to Springfield to live with her older sister Elizabeth, who had married Ninian W. Edwards, son of the former Governor of Illinois. The Edwards home was the center of Springfield’s social scene, and given that the city had far more single men than eligible women, their home was the place to shop for a well-heeled husband. Mary was in her element. Her advanced education gave her the advantage of choosing which of her many suitors she might spend time with, among them Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAlthough Lincoln’s six-foot-four-inch lankiness towered over Mary’s five-foot-two-inch roundness, the two began courting over the winter of 1839–40. The courtship was somewhat one-sided. Lincoln remained a rough, uncouth, awkward man who alternated between sitting quietly and blurting out inappropriate faux pas. He was charmed by Mary’s knowledge and wit, often staring at her in apparent awe as she led the conversation. Still, she saw something in him and their unlikely courtship blossomed…and eventually became engaged.\n\nA Hiatus\n\nAnd then they stopped. Somewhere between late 1840 and early 1841 they abruptly, although mutually, called off the engagement. Many agreed that Lincoln backed out, fearing he could not suitably meet any wife’s needs as a husband because of his distracted nature. Whatever the reason, they were no longer courting throughout 1841 and into 1842.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nSometime in 1842 Mary and Lincoln began secretly courting again. To the astonishment of the Springfield social set, Lincoln and Mary suddenly decided they would get married—that night. Elizabeth Edwards claimed the wedding occurred with only two hours’ notice, and indeed the marriage license was issued that very day. Lincoln had a “deer in the highlights” look as he approached the hurried ceremony in the Edwards parlor. According to friends, when Lincoln was dressing for ceremony he was asked where he was going, to which he replied, “I guess I’m going to hell.” At least one Lincoln scholar believes Mary may have seduced Lincoln the night before into doing something that obligated him to marriage. Whatever the reason, they were married on November 4, 1842. A week later he seemed resigned to the fact, closing a business letter with, “Nothing new here except my marrying, which to me, is matter of profound wonder.”\n\nA Sad Life\n\nMary lived a life of recurring sadness. Her husband spent six months out of every year on the circuit, traveling from town to town as a lawyer…that is, when he wasn’t away as a state legislator, then U.S. Representative, or stumping for other candidates. Their son Eddy died as a toddler. Willie would die in the White House. And then the tragedy of having her husband assassinated next to her as they watched Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theatre. [Tragedy would extend to their companions that night: Major Henry Rathbone would later kill his then-fiancée, Clara Harris and spend the rest of his days in an insane asylum.] Mary would find herself in an asylum as well, put there by her only remaining son, Robert, as her life spiraled out of control. Eventually she would settle with her sister in Springfield, where she would die of a stroke on July 16, 1882, passing away in the very same house where she and Abraham Lincoln had been married so many years ago.\n\nBy the way, Mary never went by Mary Todd Lincoln. She was Mary Lincoln or Mrs. Lincoln. Only after her death did her family, the still influential Todds of Kentucky, start referring to her at Mary Todd Lincoln in an effort to firmly connect the wealthy family to the Lincoln name.\n\n[Adapted from Lincoln: The Man Who Saved America]\n\nDavid J.

I’m reminded of this today because on December 6, 1864, Lincoln nominated former Treasury Secretary, and constant foil, Salmon P. Chase to be the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Chase was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, and thus ended the nearly 30 year reign of the recently deceased Roger B. Taney.\n\nAs much as Chase had been an irritant while sitting in Lincoln’s “team of rivals” cabinet, Taney had been a major thorn, twisting the wounds as much as he could possibly do. As Commander-in-Chief during a time of insurrection, Lincoln felt he could take drastic steps to save the Union, including the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus when necessary. Taney disagreed, and in his duel role as circuit court judge ruled against Lincoln. Lincoln ignored Taney but did get Congress to pass the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act to officially legalize his actions.\n\nTaney’s earlier Dred Scott Decision in 1857 had an even greater impact on Abraham Lincoln’s career. This widely despised decision played center stage in the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, and while Lincoln lost that Senate race on the vagaries of state-legislature-picked Senators, it set him up as the Republican party’s leader on the slavery question. In a sense, it helped make him President.\n\nEven earlier, Lincoln had tried two cases in the U.S. Supreme Court to go along with his 175 cases pled at the Illinois State Supreme Court.\n\nBut Lincoln also had another major influence on the U.S. Supreme Court while President. The two dissenting judges on the Dred Scott case needed to be replaced (one died within weeks of Lincoln’s inauguration while the other had quit the court in disgust after the Dred Scott decision). One of the majority judges in the Dred Scott case also needed replacement; he quit the court after Lincoln’s inauguration and became the Confederate Assistant Secretary of War. So Lincoln filled three Supreme Court judgeships with Noah Haynes Swayne, Samuel Freeman Miller, and David Davis.\n\nAh, but this is where it gets interesting. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to determine how many Supreme Court justices will sit. That number had ranged from five to nine during our history, but Congress decided to deal with the many leftovers from the Dred Scott case by adding a tenth justice. Lincoln thus was able to appoint an extra new justice to the court, which he did in 1863 with Steven Johnson Field. It should be noted that Congress, in order to keep Lincoln’s successor, Andrew Johnson, from appointing pro-slavery justices to the court, reduced the number of justices down to seven. Immediately after Johnson was out of office, Congress reset the number once again to nine, so since 1869 that number has been the standard up to today.\n\nWith Salmon P. Chase’s appointment as Chief Justice, Lincoln put a total of five judges on the Supreme Court, one of the most prolific appointer-in-chief in our history.\n\nDavid J.
