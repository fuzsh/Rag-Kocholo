        "text": "Analysis: If Kagan is worried about one state making the national decision, that's the game\n\nAlthough the Republican-appointed justices were all skeptical of Colorado’s position, we also heard skeptical questions from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, too.\n\nThat could be a sign that there’s a consensus building for one of the “off-ramps” that would let justices avoid deciding if Trump is or isn’t an “insurrectionist” — although it’s not clear which of the procedural arguments have the most support.\n\nKagan asked Jason Murray, the attorney for the Colorado voters, why one state should get to decide who runs for president nationally.\n\nIf that’s what Kagan is worried about, it’s hard to see even two votes for affirming the decision — let alone five.\n\nJustice Gorsuch asks if \"insurrectionist ban\" applies to running for office or holding office\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch asked a key question to the anti-Trump challengers, about whether the “insurrectionist ban” applies to running for office or holding office.\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment says no person “shall be” an officeholder “or hold any office” if they are an oath-breaking insurrectionist.\n\nThe challengers – and Colorado’s top election official – say this means the ban applies to candidates because states have an interest in making sure that only qualified candidates appear on their ballots.\n\nIf the court were to conclude that the ban applies to potential officeholders, and not office-seekers, then that would open the door to a scenario where Trump wins in November, but then lawsuits are filed to block him from being sworn in next year.\n\nA trio of legal scholars, including a top GOP election lawyer, warned the justices about that doomsday scenario in a friend-of-the-court brief filed last month.\n\n“The chance that there would be no clear answer come Inauguration Day 2025 — and that the country thereby would be thrown into a possibly catastrophic constitutional crisis — is disturbingly high,” they wrote.\n\nHere's what to know about the initial arguments made by Trump's lawyer\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell concluded his initial arguments before the Supreme Court justices after nearly an hour.\n\nHere are some of the key things that happened:\n\nPower of states: Several of the justices from both ideological sides pressed the Trump lawyer about stripping states of their ability to exclude candidates from power, including whether an “admitted insurrectionist” could be removed from the ballot.\n\nMitchell argued that it was the role of Congress to determine whether someone should be disqualified — so even if a person admits to being an insurrectionist, states have no basis to act. “Even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, Section 3 (of the 14th Amendment) still allows the candidate to run for office, and even win election for office, and then see whether Congress lifts that disability after the election,” Mitchell said in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe role of Congress: Mitchell argued that Colorado’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot was improper because, among other reasons, the state disqualified Trump before Congress explicitly gave it the power to do that.\n\nThe debate over the term “officer”: The justices pressed Mitchell over whether the framers of the 14th Amendment believed the president is an “officer of” the United States, and therefore subject to the “insurrectionist ban” under Section 3. The argument is a central focus of the former president’s legal team, which believes that when the amendment’s framers wrote “officer,” they meant lower federal officials appointed by the president – not the president himself.\n\nThat discussion led to this particularly intense exchange:\n\nWhat happens next for Trump’s legal team: Mitchell will have an opportunity to make brief rebuttal arguments to the justices at the end of the hearing, after lawyers for the Colorado voters and secretary of state finish presenting their case.\n\nJustices ask why a single state should able to decide who can be on the ballot in a national election\n\nJustice Elena Kagan pushed the attorney for the Colorado voters over why a single state should have the power to decide which candidates can be on the ballot for a national election.\n\n“I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be President of the United States,” Kagan asked attorney Jason Murray.\n\n“Why should a single state have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but also for the nation,” she asked, saying that “seems quite extraordinary.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett echoed the concerns, adding “it just doesn’t seem like a state call.”\n\nIn response, Murray argued that each state would still have the ability to determine what appears on their own ballots, despite what officials in another state might decide.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nAnalysis: Justices are shying away from the violence of January 6 despite lawyer's efforts\n\nJason Murray, arguing for the Colorado voters, is challenging the justices to grapple with the legal definition of insurrection — arguing the January 6, 2021, riot was such an unprecedented attack.\n\nBut many of the justices have been focused on more pedestrian issues in this case that would take them away from the facts of the attack, such as how and if states determine ballot eligibility — related to anything from ballot eligibility or even residency or age.\n\nJustices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh specifically challenged Murray on the ability of states to dictate who can hold federal office.\n\nMuch of the questioning of former President Donald Trump’s attorney Jonathan Mitchell also revolved around similar sweeping questions of state power and how the 14th Amendment could allow for Colorado to do what it has done on its 2024 primary ballot.\n\nThomas asks whether there are examples of states disqualifying candidates under 14th Amendment\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas asked why there weren’t more examples of states disqualifying candidates under the 14th Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nJason Murray, who is arguing on behalf of the Colorado voters, pointed to one example of a disqualified candidate, saying it was not surprising there weren’t more because elections then were often decided by parties or as write-ins without ballots.\n\nThomas appeared skeptical, however. “There were a plethora of confederates still around, there were any number of people who would continue to either run for state offices or national offices, so it would seem — that would suggest there would at least be a few examples of national candidates being disqualified,” Thomas said.\n\n“There were certainly national candidates disqualified by Congress refusing to seat them,” Murray said.\n\n“I understand, but that’s not this case. States disqualify them – that’s what we’re talking about here,” Thomas responded.\n\nRoberts signals skepticism over key argument from Trump's challengers\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, a key vote to watch in the case, suggested one of the main arguments raised by challengers was “at war” with the history of the insurrection ban at center in the case.\n\n“The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Roberts said. “On the other hand, it augmented federal power.”\n\nRoberts suggested the idea that the amendment would give states power to remove candidates under the provision would be “at war” with the whole thrust and history of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe challengers claimed the 14th Amendment lets states bar insurrectionists from the ballot – which means in simple terms that Congress was providing some very strong powers to the states. But Congress wrote and ratified that amendment during the Reconstruction Era, when they were trying to reign in rogue Southern states after the Civil War and reassert federal powers over civil rights.\n\nEarly signs from Supreme Court arguments look promising for Trump\n\nThere were signs from the first hour of arguments that things were going decently for former President Donald Trump — notably questions posed by a number of centrist justices that appeared to signal support for his position.\n\nIt’s still early, and oral arguments often are misleading because only one side is arguing at a time. But here are a few themes that have developed early.\n\nAn 1869 case takes center stage Several of the justices – notably Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – have asked a lot of questions about a post-Civil War lower court decision that held that the insurrection ban cannot be enforced without action from Congress. The focus on that decision is a good sign for Trump, who raised the ruling extensively in his briefing.\n\nLiberals appear cautious. The court’s three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – have asked tough questions, but they too have focused on narrow provisions, avoiding broad questions about whether the president engaged in an insurrection. There has been speculation the court may try to avoid deciding if there was an insurrection in its final ruling.\n\nTrump himself was rarely a talking point. The justices have not said much about what happened on January 6, 2021. Instead, in the first hour of arguments, they focused on technical matters about whether the insurrection ban in the 14th Amendment applies.\n\nNearly 1,000 US Capitol rioters have been convicted or pleaded guilty\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been charged in connection to the January 6, 2021 US Capitol insurrection, according to Justice Department statistics.\n\nProsecutors have secured guilty pleas or convictions for more than 930 of those people, from low level misdemeanors for trespassing on Capitol grounds to assault charges for brutal attacks on law enforcement.\n\nMore than half of the defendants who have been sentenced already received jail time – the longest of which is a 22 year prison sentence given to former Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio.\n\nAmong the convicted individuals are dozens of members of far-right organizations, including groups like the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys. Leaders of those organizations were convicted of seditious conspiracy – the first federal convictions of the charge in more than a decade – for attempting to lead their followers in failed plots to stop Joe Biden from becoming the president.\n\nInvestigators are still searching for hundreds of individuals they say were involved in the attack, including the person who placed pipe bombs near the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters the night before the riot.\n\nSenate Judiciary chair says Justice Thomas should have recused himself from Trump's ballot case\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin told reporters that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should have recused himself from today’s 14th Amendment case, as the Court considers whether former President Donald Trump should be barred from the ballot.\n\nDurbin added that “it remains to be seen” if the justices can rule fairly in this case.\n\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine told CNN’s Manu Raju that he believes the Court will reject the 14th Amendment argument.\n\n“The Supreme Court is going to decide it, and, I think, probably not accept the claim,” said Kaine, noting that his belief is “based on the way the court has handled matters in the past.”\n\nRemember: Durbin’s remarks join others in their call for Thomas to recuse himself from the case. Eight Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Thomas last month as the court was still considering whether to take up Trump’s appeal. They said Ginni’s role in the January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally that she attended made it “unthinkable” that the justice could be impartial in deciding whether the event constituted an insurrection.\n\nTrump lawyer argues January 6 was a \"riot,\" not insurrection\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s lawyer Jonathan Mitchell argued that the events of January 6 were “shameful, criminal, violent” – but not an insurrection.\n\nThe definition of insurrection is crucial to the case because if January 6 doesn’t reach that high bar, then Trump couldn’t have “engaged in insurrection,” which would disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment.\n\nMitchell made these comments while being questioned by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was the only justice to ask him sharp questions about the definition of “insurrection” that touched on Trump’s conduct on that day.\n\nNotably, Mitchell’s comments condemning January 6 are different than what his client, Trump, regularly says in interviews and on the campaign trail, and even on that day. He has repeatedly praised his supporters and bemoaned the fact that hundreds of them are now being subjected to criminal prosecution for their actions.\n\nSotomayor questions Trump lawyer on argument Trump was never a sworn officer\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Donald Trump’s attorney on whether his argument that the former president is not covered by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment because he is not an “officer” of the United States.\n\nAs part of that argument, Trump’s lawyers have argued that Trump has never taken an oath as an officer of the United States. Sotomayor pointed out that he’s the only president that this applies to — because all past presidents either took that oath as lawmakers or as military officers.\n\nTrump is the first president to have never held office — civil or military — before ascending to the presidency.\n\n“I certainly wouldn’t call it gerrymandered,” Trump’s lawyer responded, saying it should not be considered nefarious.\n\nTrump accuses his challengers of pursuing an \"anti-democratic\" legal case against him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday urged the Supreme Court to keep his name on Colorado’s ballot, accusing his challengers of pursuing an “anti-democratic” legal case against him.\n\nTrump’s attorneys compared the litigation seeking to remove him from the ballot to anti-democratic efforts in Venezuela.\n\n“Yet at a time when the United States is threatening sanctions against the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela for excluding the leading opposition candidate for president from the ballot,” they claimed, the voters who brought the case are asking the Supreme Court “to impose that same anti-democratic measure at home.”\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments Thursday in the blockbuster challenge to Trump’s ballot eligibility because of his role in the events that led to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. A group of Colorado voters claim those actions amounted to an insurrection and that the Constitution bars him from holding office.\n\n2 states have removed Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment and January 6 riot\n\nAdvocacy groups and critics of former President Donald Trump are trying to remove him from the 2024 presidential ballot based on the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which says public officials who have “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from ever serving again.\n\nTwo states – Colorado and Maine – have determined that this ban applies to Trump, because of his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Both states stripped him from the Republican primary ballot, though those decisions were paused on appeal. The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Colorado case on Thursday.\n\nBut the attempts to block Trump from the ballot fell flat in several other key states, where lawsuits were dismissed on procedural grounds and never reached the questions about Trump’s actions on January 6. This includes Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois, and elsewhere.\n\nCNN is tracking the major decisions on Trump’s eligibility. See where the major anti-Trump ballot challenges stand across the United States.\n\nHere's what the 14th Amendment says — and why it is at the center of Colorado's case against Trump\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday in the historic efforts to disqualify former President Donald Trump from office because of his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The case revolves around the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban,” a relic of the Civil War that hasn’t been touched in more than a century until the Trump-fueled attack on the US Capitol.\n\nWhat does the 14th Amendment say? The 14th Amendment says Americans who take an oath to uphold the Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection” are disqualified from holding future public office.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban. And there is an open legal debate over how some of the terms in the vague provision should be defined. For instance, the amendment doesn’t explain what level of political violence is tantamount to “insurrection.”\n\nThe US Supreme Court is reviewing a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court, which said in a landmark 4-3 ruling in December that the “insurrectionist ban” applies to Trump.\n\nTrump expected to stay away from SCOTUS arguments after turning past court appearances into campaign stops\n\nAfter turning several recent trials and court hearings into campaign stops, Donald Trump is not expected to be in the room when the highest court in the land takes up the question of his ballot eligibility, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump’s lawyers will appear at the US Supreme Court for arguments over a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court to throw Trump off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding public office. Trump currently doesn’t plan to be there. Instead, he’ll be at Mar-a-Lago in Florida before traveling to a Nevada caucus victory party in Las Vegas.\n\n“There is no upside to him attending these arguments,” one source close to the legal team tells CNN. “Trump understands how serious this is – the stakes could not be higher.”\n\nTrump’s decision not to attend the historic Supreme Court arguments in the case – which would determine his ballot eligibility nationwide – is an indication of how carefully his team is handling the case before the court where Trump appointed one-third of the justices on the bench to create a conservative supermajority.\n\nThe arguments come as the Supreme Court is also expected to consider a more perilous legal question for Trump – whether he is immune from criminal prosecution for his actions following the 2020 election. Trump may feel more strongly about attending those arguments, according to another source familiar with his legal strategy.\n\nWhile many legal experts believe Trump could prevail on the ballot challenges issue, his appearance could be considered disruptive to the normally staid and above-the-fray decorum of the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump and his team have treated various court appearances as opportunities for him to cry “election interference,” call out who he deems “Trump-hating” judges and attack the system as rigged “political persecution.” His presence and the attendant\n\nKeep reading here about how Trump is juggling the campaign and courtroom.\n\nAnalysis: Supreme Court may not emerge unscathed from its latest date with Trump\n\nFew critical US democratic institutions have escaped unsullied from a tangle with Donald Trump.\n\nNow, the US Supreme Court faces its greatest test so far from the former president.\n\nOn Thursday, the nine justices will hear a case with critical implications for the 2024 election – over the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to remove Trump from the ballot over the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist” clause.\n\nHow Trump works the refs: Even though Trump is not expected to attend Thursday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court, the justices know what’s coming.\n\nThe prospect of being dragged into the hyper-politicized arena of a presidential election is a nightmare enough for Chief Justice John Roberts, who has often sought to guard the high court against reputational damage from the country’s raging politics.\n\nBut an election case involving Trump, in a time of far greater partisan fury than the bitter aftermath of the 2000 election, could be an even graver matter – especially if any of the court’s rulings eventually go against Trump.\n\nHow Trump leans on judges: Any judge that delivers verdicts contradictory to Trump’s view risks becoming a target. The former president’s attack on a district judge that ruled against the Trump administration in an asylum case prompted Roberts in 2019 to try to insulate the judiciary from politics. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts wrote in an extraordinary statement that did not name Trump, but clearly had him in mind. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”\n\nRead more about how few critical US institutions have emerged unscathed from an encounter with Trump.\n\nYour guide to today's Supreme Court arguments — and who will be speaking before the justices\n\nThe Supreme Court has set aside 80 minutes for arguments in today’s historic dispute over whether former President Donald Trump disqualified himself from the ballot for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nIn reality, the debate will carry on for much longer.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, is expected to kick off the arguments a little after 10 a.m. ET with a brief opening statement and will then field a barrage of questions from the bench. Jason Murray, representing the Colorado voters who challenged Trump, will present next. Finally, Shannon Stevenson, Colorado’s top appellate attorney, will speak on behalf of Secretary of State Jena Griswold.\n\nEach attorney will first take questions from the justices in something of a free-for-all format. Then, Chief Justice John Roberts will permit each justice to ask a few questions in order of seniority.\n\nAt the end of the arguments, Mitchell will return to the well of the courtroom for a short rebuttal.\n\nArguing before the Supreme Court involves an enormous amount of preparation, from nailing the intricacies of an argument to anticipating hypothetical questions from justices.\n\nMitchell arranged two moot courts to practice before the justices took their seats. Murray had planned four. Such sessions are designed to expose the weaknesses in a case, devise solutions and refine its strong points. The tougher the moot – the adage goes – the smoother the actual argument.\n\nRead more about how the arguments are expected to unfold.\n\nWhat to know about Norma Anderson — the Colorado Republican leading the 14th Amendment challenge against Trump\n\nNorma Anderson, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office, is a lifelong Republican who has had a storied political career, including stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.\n\n“I’m an old-fashioned Republican that believes in strong defense, supporting business, and helping those who don’t know how to help themselves, and less government, and a fair tax base,” Anderson said.\n\nHere are some highlights of her career:\n\nShe spent 12 years in the statehouse, before having to leave due to term limits. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of majority leader in 2003.\n\nHer record: While serving in the Colorado statehouse, Anderson helped enact legislation to improve child literacy and lower the cost of in-state colleges and established a home nursing program with funds from a landmark lawsuit against the large tobacco companies.\n\nBattling Trump – especially in court – comes with acclaim in some circles, and vitriol in others. Anderson said she has received a lot of support from friends and family, except for one or two holdouts who are still die-hard Trump supporters. She said most of her friends weren’t surprised that she got involved in the case.\n\n“I was born four months before FDR was elected,” Anderson said. “I’ve lived through a lot of presidents. Some I liked, some I didn’t. But not one of them caused an insurrection, until Donald Trump.”\n\nLearn more about Anderson’s life, work and stances here.\n\nYour questions about the Supreme Court and Trump's many legal cases, answered\n\nThere is a dizzying array of court cases related to former President Donald Trump. Only one is headed to the US Supreme Court this week. It is a Colorado case in which Trump was declared ineligible for the state’s 2024 ballot for violating the Civil War-era insurrection clause in the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nWhen we asked CNN readers for their questions about the Supreme Court case, it quickly became clear in the hundreds of responses that a lot of people are struggling to keep all of Trump’s legal issues separate.\n\nFor instance, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Thursday in the 14th Amendment case – the same week that an appeals court in Washington, DC, clarified that, no, Trump does not enjoy “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFor an excellent, shorter version of what might happen at the court this week, listen to this “One Thing” podcast with CNN’s Supreme Court expert Joan Biskupic.\n\nIn answering readers’ questions, we’ve tried to delineate between the multiple cases involving Trump. We’ve also edited the wording in some questions for grammar and style.\n\nRead our answers’ to readers’ questions.\n\nUS Capitol Police officers say Trump’s January 6 speech isn’t protected by the First Amendment\n\nA group of current and former US Capitol Police officers who defended the iconic building on January 6, 2021, want the court to reject Trump’s argument that his speech that day is protected by the First Amendment.\n\n“Mr. Trump’s explicit instructions to a vast crowd to assault the Capitol and disrupt the proceedings of Congress — is precisely the kind of speech that is excluded from the First Amendment’s protections,” the group of current and former officers argued in a friend-of-the-court brief.\n\nTrump’s attorneys say, among other things, that his speech that day is shielded by longstanding First Amendment precedents because he wasn’t trying to incite imminent violence.\n\nThe group of five current and three former Capitol Police officers behind the brief brought a civil lawsuit against Trump and several of his allies in 2021. The officers were at the Capitol during the riot and, according to court documents, were violently attacked by members of the mob.\n\n“Attackers breached the Capitol’s defenses, forced entry, and temporarily obstructed Congress’s electoral vote count, ” the brief said. “In the process, the attackers violently assaulted (the officers who filed the brief) and other Capitol Police officers, striking them and spraying them with toxic chemicals.”\n\nRetired conservative federal judge wants Trump disqualified from office\n\nA former conservative federal appellate judge is among those asking the Supreme Court to keep Donald Trump off the ballot, arguing the ex-president’s effort to cling to power after his 2020 election loss was “broader” than South Carolina’s secession from the US that triggered the Civil War.\n\n“Mr. Trump tried to prevent the newly-elected President Biden from governing anywhere in the United States. The South Carolina secession prevented the newly-elected President Lincoln from governing only in that State,” J. Michael Luttig, a former judge on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, told the justices in a friend-of-the-court brief.\n\n“In doing so, Mr. Trump disqualified himself under Section 3 (of the Constitution).”\n\nLuttig has long been one of the most high-profile conservatives to argue that Trump engaged in an insurrection following his loss in 2020 and that he should as a result be barred from holding office. He played a critical role in the heated fight over the certification of the 2020 presidential election, providing in a series of tweets legal ammunition to help then-Vice President Mike Pence defy Trump’s attempt to overturn the election.\n\nRead more.\n\nLead plaintiff in Trump ballot case is a Republican who would support Nikki Haley\n\nNorma Anderson already earned her spot in the Colorado history books before becoming the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from office.\n\nThe standoff with Trump is one final chapter in the 91-year-old’s storied political career, which includes stints as the first-ever woman majority leader in both chambers of the Colorado legislature.\n\nAnderson, who still identifies as a Republican, spent 12 years in the state house. While there, from 1997 to 1998, she was the majority leader of the lower chamber. After that, she won a seat in the state Senate, and spent seven years there. She similarly reached the post of Senate majority leader in 2003. She was the first woman to hold both senior positions.\n\nRead more about Anderson and how the case got to the Supreme Court.\n\nCNN Poll: Americans are skeptical of SCOTUS’ ability to rule on election cases\n\nMost Americans have less than total confidence in the Supreme Court to handle any election-related legal cases, according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nJust 11% say they have a great deal of trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on any cases related to the 2024 election, with 31% expressing a moderate amount of trust, 35% just some, and 23% none at all.\n\nRoughly half (52%) of Republicans express a great deal or moderate amount of trust, with 17% saying they don’t trust the Supreme Court at all on the issues. Doubts are higher among Democrats: just 36% have at least a moderate amount of trust in the court to handle election-related cases, with 27% saying they have no trust at all.\n\nTiming is key as well.\n\nAbout half of all Americans, 48%, say they think it’s essential that a verdict is reached before this year’s election on the federal charges Trump faces related to election subversion in 2020 before this year’s presidential election.\n\nRead more about CNN’s poll."
