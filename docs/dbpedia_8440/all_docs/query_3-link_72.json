        "text": "The share of Americans with a favorable opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to its lowest point in public opinion surveys dating to 1987.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the federal judges President Joe Biden has appointed so far are women, and the same share are members of racial or ethnic minority groups.\n\nAmericans express highly negative views of President Joe Biden, congressional leadership in both parties and Congress more broadly. Views of the economy remain overwhelmingly negative, and there has been a sharp rise in the share who say the country cannot solve many of its important problems.\n\nThere has been a jump in the share of U.S. adults who see the Supreme Court as “friendly” toward religion.\n\nBut they hold differing opinions about what that phrase means, and two-thirds of U.S. adults say churches should keep out of politics.\n\nAmericans’ ratings of the Supreme Court are now as negative as – and more politically polarized than – at any point in more than three decades of polling. And nearly two-thirds of Democrats (64%) now say the Supreme Court has too much power, almost three times the share who said this in August 2020 (23%).\n\nOpinion on the legality of abortion has changed little since before the court’s decision, with 62% now saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases."
