        "text": "* Notwithstanding the Vice President salary of $284,600 for 2024 listed by the Office of Personnel Management, the amount payable to the Vice President has been frozen since 2019.\n\n* The payable salary of the Vice President has been subject to a pay freeze since 2014 but was increased this year by an act of Congress. The official 2019 Vice President salary in the Executive Schedule ($246,900) is higher than the payable amount. This amount is annually adjusted as a ceiling on the salary of certain federal employees. A pending FY 2019 appropriations may allow for a requested increase in salaries for Supreme Court Justices."
