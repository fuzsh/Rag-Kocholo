The Chief Justice of the United States is the senior judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.

He has no more powers than any of the other judges of the Supreme Court, who are called Associate Justices. The Chief Justice is responsible for organising the Court's schedules and administration.

By tradition, the Chief Justice administers the oath of office to the President when the president starts his time as president. The only time this has not happened is when Calvin Coolidge became president.
