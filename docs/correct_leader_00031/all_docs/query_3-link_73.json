        "text": "Bassel al Assad (23 March 1962 â€“ 21 January 1994) was the eldest son of the former Syrian President Hafez Assad. Bassel Assad was born on 23 March 1962. He was trained as an engineer. However, he chose a military career. He rapidly became a major and then commander of a brigade in the Republican Guard. From a young age, Bassel Assad was groomed to fill the role of President by his father, Hafez Assad. He organized a highly publicized anti-corruption campaign within the regime, and frequently appeared in full military uniform at official receptions, signaling the regime's commitment to the armed forces. He was also head of Syria's computer association. Since his last election victory in 1991, then President Hafez Assad was publicly referred to as 'Abu Basil' (Father of Bassel). The Baath Party press in Syria long ago eulogised Bassel Assad as 'the golden knight' due to his prowess in horsemanship.[5] He first emerged on the national scene in 1987, when he won several equestrian medals at a regional tournament. He also had a reputation for his interest in fast cars. It was said by officials in Damascus, Bassel Assad was uncorrupt and honest. His friends and teachers describe Bassel as charismatic and commanding. Assad is said to have spoken French fluently. He was being introduced to European and Arab leaders at that period, and he was a close friend of the children of King Hussein of Jordan. He had been also introduced to King Fahd and then Lebanese leaders of all sects. Death On 21 January 1994, driving his Mercedes at high speed through fog to Damascus International Airport for a flight to Germany in the early hours of the morning, Bassel is said to have collided with a motorway roundabout, and he died instantly. It was reported that his cousin, Hafez Makhlouf, was with him and hospitalized with injuries after the accident. Bassel Assad's body was taken to Assad University hospital. Aftermath After his death, shops, schools and public offices in Syria closed for three days, and luxury hotels suspended the sale of alcohol in respect.[3] Bassel Assad was elevated by the state into the martyr of the country, the martyr of the nation and the symbol for its youth. Numerous squares and streets were named after him. The new international swimming complex, various hospitals, sporting clubs and a military academy were also named after him. His statue is found in several Syrian cities, and even after his death he is often pictured at billboards with his father and brother. He is buried in Qardaha, his father's village of birth,[5] in a large mausoleum, where Hafez al-Assad was laid to rest beside him in 2000. Consequences\n\nBassel Assad's death led to his lesser-known brother Bashar Assad, then undertaking sub-speciality training in ophthalmology in London, assuming the mantle of President-in-waiting. Bashar Assad became President following the death of Hafez Assad on 10 June 2000. Bassel Assad's posters and his name were also used to secure a smooth transition after Hafez Assad through the slogan \"Basil, the Example: Bashar, the Future.\""
