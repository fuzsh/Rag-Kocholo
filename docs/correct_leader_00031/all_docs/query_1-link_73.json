He had been in effective control of the country for four months already since as Defence Minister, he seized power in November 1970 and assumed the premiership. Since then, the 58-year-old president has strengthened his position at home and played an increasing role in Middle East politics through his unswerving support of the Palestinian cause. His relations with other Arab leaders have fluctuated over the years. On coming to power, Assad took steps to align his country with Egypt but relations deteriorated following Cairo's agreement with Israel. President Assad has maintained close links with the Soviet Union, on which he depends for the equipment and training of his army. Meanwhile, Western powers have come to recognise his vital role as mediator in Middle East conflicts, notably in Lebanon, where his military involvement brought him close to all-out war with Israel, a major political foe.\n\nSYNOPSIS: Religious imbalances in Syria have long been reflected in the country's leadership. Assad's rule is based on the minority Alawite sect, a situation that has led to sporadic unrest. Early in 1979, 50 military cadets were murdered in Aleppo. Most of them were Alawites. There have been similar incidents in later years, but President Assad, now in his third term of office, is one of the longest ruling heads of state in the Middle East.\n\nAfter an initial rapprochement with Anwar Sadat, relations were damaged when Egypt made two agreements with Israel in the aftermath of the October War in 1973. However, Syria herself made one agreement, which restored Kuneitra to her rule. President Assad personally raised the flag over the ruined town to mark the end of seven years of Israeli occupation.\n\nIsrael's invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 brought yet another confrontation with Syria, who had some 30,000 troops there. This, Assad claimed, was necessary for Syria's own security against the Israeli threat. The risk of war was narrowly averted with a ceasefire agreement on June 11.\n\nIn August, agreement was reached on the evacuation of PLO and Syrian forces from Beirut but the relative positions of Syrian and Israeli forces in the rest of Lebanon did not alter.\n\nPresident Assad opposed US-sponsored diplomatic initiatives in 1983 and rejected outright an agreement with Israel for the withdrawal, within three months, of all foreign troops from Lebanon. This created a stalemate with the Israelis, who said they would not leave Lebanon unless the Syrians and the PLO did so first. Israel withdrew from Beirut in September 1983 by Syria's army remained entrenched in Lebanon. Assad continued to support Druze and Shi'ite factions against the government of President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon. He was also backing Palestinian rebels against PLO leader Yasser Arafat, whom they blamed for the Palestinian retreat -- and humiliation, of 1982.\n\nPresident Assad was re-elected for a third seven-year term in 1985. By then, the existence in Lebanon of a government of national unity including Druze and Shi'ite representation was a testimony to the extent of Syrian influence in the country's affairs. Israel, forced by domestic pressures, had withdrawn unilaterally from Lebanon in the latter half of 1984. The Syrians, however, were back in West Beirut by the beginning of 1987, to try and disarm feuding factions. Although they have failed to impose peace, their presence has given President Assad a major role to play in any future diplomatic effort to solve the Lebanese problem.\n\nPresident Assad's visit to Moscow last year was his second since 1985. Syria is the Soviet Union's closest Middle East ally, and diplomats say Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was keen to see Assad iron out his differences with Yasser Arafat. Gorbachev is also said to have urged Assad to soften his anti-Egyptian stance to pave the way for an international conference on the Middle East ... an item which dominated the Amman Summit in November .. The presence of two bitter political foes -- Sadam Hussein of Iraq and Assad of Syria was a first step towards Arab unity. The presence of Amin Gemayel of Lebanon was also significant: Assad had boycotted Gemayel, a Christian, since he refused to endorse a Syrian-sponsored peace accord in 1986.\n\nIsrael's recent problems in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories have prompted renewed diplomatic initiatives from the US. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir welcomed US Secretary of State George Shultz on March 4:\n\nBut he later dismissed the US peace plan as 'unacceptable'. The plan calls for an international conference and an interim period of self-rule for Palestinians in Israeli-Occupied Territories. Israel is opposed to PLO representation at such a conference. Syria and most Arab countries insist on the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO. however, Assad has not rejected the US plan. His cautious response is undoubtedly that of a seasoned politician, confident in his role of mediator in the intricacies of Middle Eastern questions.\n\nCopyright Holder: FILE REUTERS (CAN SELL)\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2014.
