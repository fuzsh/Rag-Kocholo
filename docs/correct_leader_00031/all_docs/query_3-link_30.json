        "text": "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Hafez Assad, Syria's autocratic president who dreamed of Arab unity but watched his neighbors sign peace deals with Israel, died Saturday before he was able to win back the treasured Golan Heights he lost to the Jewish state 33 years ago. Assad, 69, had been suffering from heart problems.\n\nThe death of the skillful and ruthless leader could deal a blow to Mideast peace prospects by ushering in a prolonged period of instability, but it could also mean an opportunity for Syria to forsake at least part of its implacable enmity toward Israel.\n\nThe Syrian parliament moved to clear the way for Assad's son, Bashar (left, in lower photo), to assume the presidency, amending the constitution to lower the minimum age for presidents to 34 -- Bashar's age. Then parliament adjourned until June 25. No funeral plans were immediately announced.\n\nAs word spread in Syria, a few hundred people gathered in the streets near the presidential palace, chanting \"With our souls, with our blood, we will protect you, O Bashar.\" More police than usual were on the streets in this heavily policed state.\n\nSyria's red-black-and-white flags were lowered to half-staff. Stores closed. Secondary school exams, scheduled this weekend, were postponed until next week. Loudspeakers at government buildings, hotels and other establishments resounded with verses from the Koran, Islam's holy scriptures.\n\n\"This is a day of sadness and sorrow in every home, school, university, farm, factory and quarry,\" an announcer on state-run television said. \"Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and child. ... The legacy of his accomplishments and ideas is a planet that will shine not just on this generation, but also on coming generations.\"\n\nThe United States and Israel, two countries with which Syria often is at odds, expressed sorrow, and condolences poured from the Middle East and capitals around the world.\n\n\"We had our differences, but I always respected him,\" President Clinton said.\n\nAssad, a career air force officer who took power in a bloodless coup in 1970, has been grooming Bashar for future leadership, but the British-educated ophthalmologist has held no major political office.\n\nInstead, Bashar has been going abroad as his father's special envoy. At home, he has been waging an anti-corruption campaign. He was expected to be brought into the ruling Baath Party leadership at a congress to open June 17.\n\nSyria's constitution provides for a vice president to take over if the presidency is vacated. Syria currently has two vice presidents Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Zuheir Masharqa. Khaddam is first vice president, but reportedly fell out of favor in the past two years as Bashar's star rose.\n\nIt was not known whether Assad specified that Masharqa take over in an interim period. He has been in charge of political and Baath Party affairs and is thought to have little influence with the military.\n\nAssad had suffered from heart problems, lymphoma and kidney failure, according to a Lebanese heart surgeon close to the Assad family. The surgeon, who insisted on anonymity, said Assad died of heart failure.\n\nSyrian television showed members of the nation's parliament standing, heads bowed in the chamber for a moment of silence, wiping away tears. Soon after, the television switched to Koranic recitations, a standard practice in the Muslim world following a leader's death.\n\nWithin hours, somber new posters showing the late president with Bashar appeared on car windows; black ribbons were tied to car radio antennas.\n\nLebanese President Emil Lahoud, in a letter to Bashar, wrote that he was the last to speak to the Syrian leader. \"The last phrase he told me was that our fate is to build for our children an assuring future and it is our duty to make sure they inherit better than what we inherited,\" Lahoud said in a letter distributed by his office. \"Then there was a sudden silence and the line broke off.\"\n\nThe country Assad led was isolated and economically troubled. But Syria's president for three decades never hinted he saw himself as a man defeated.\n\nA case in point were on-again, off-again negotiations with archenemy Israel. Analysts had said the 1999 election of moderate Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was Assad's last chance to win back the strategic Golan Heights captured in 1967, when Assad was defense minister.\n\nWhen his army regained a slice of the Golan in 1973 fighting, Assad went himself to raise the Syrian flag there, demonstrating the area's political importance.\n\nBut Assad was not to be hurried or pressured in talks that resumed in December after a hiatus of nearly four years.\n\nThe negotiations were suspended in January when Syria insisted Israel commit to returning to prewar 1967 borders. Israel sought lines closer to the 1923 colonial border and insisted on retaining sovereignty over a strip of land also claimed by Syria along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, a key water source.\n\nThe wily Assad often succeeded by keeping both foes and friends guessing, reversing course suddenly when he saw an advantage.\n\nSyria put aside enmity with the United States to join the U.S.-led coalition against its longtime rival Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. Assad sent troops to help drive Iraq out of Kuwait, and later reaped diplomatic and financial benefits that included $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.\n\nAssad could never be discounted in the Middle East equation. \"The Lion of Damascus\" -- his family name means lion in Arabic -- was one of the Middle East's longest serving leaders.MIDEAST LEADERSHIP\n\nA look at Mideast leaders and the transition to a new generation Prime Minister Ehud Barak, 58, won May 1999 elections with a mandate to move the peace process forward. But in recent weeks, his coalition government has shown cracks among parties hesitating at compromises he has proposed. Yasser Arafat, 70, has led the Palestinians' struggle for statehood for four decades. No clear successor has emerged, though speculation for now centers on Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. EGYPT President Hosni Mubarak, 71, recently named his younger son Gamal, who is in his 30s, as a member of the general secretariat of his ruling National Democratic Party. Mubarak is Egypt's longest serving leader, in power since 1981. SYRIA With the death of President Hafez Assad, his son Bashar is the apparent successor. An eye doctor, Bashar has only recently taken a public role in Syria, acting as his father's personal envoy to meet foreign leaders. JORDAN King Abdullah, 38, has followed the legacy of his late father, King Hussein, in taking an active role in Middle East peacemaking. He took power in February 1999. MOROCCO King Mohamed VI, 36, took power in July 1999 following the death of his father, Hassan. While Hassan played an important role in the peace process. Mohamed has concentrated on domestic issues. IRAQ Saddam Hussein, 63, took power in a 1968 coup. Saddam's oldest son, Odai, 36, and younger son Qusai, 34, rival one another to succeed the Iraqi president. Saddam has consistently opposed any peace with Israel. LIBYA Moammar Gadhafi, 58, took a leading role in the coup that ended the monarchy in 1969 and has supported the Palestinian cause. His sons Al-Saadi and Seif al-Islam have been assuming larger public roles, standing in for their father at some public occasions."
