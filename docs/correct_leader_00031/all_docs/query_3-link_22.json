        "text": "Many things seemed to unite them — from their humble rural background to their parallel career in the Ba'ath party and armed forces, as well as their mutual admiration for Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser after he successfully nationalised the Suez Canal Company in 1956 and fought off what was then coined the \"Tripartite Aggression\" by Britain, France, and Israel.\n\nA slew of foreign posts\n\nDouba's career progressed rather uneventfully until the Ba'ath Party staged a coup, coming to power in Syria on 8 March 1963. Syria's new president Amin al-Hafez appointed him deputy head of internal security and, in 1964, named him military attaché at the Syrian Embassy in London.\n\nHe steered clear from internal party politics that led to a coup on 23 February 1966, staged by army chief-of-staff Salah Jadid against President Amin al-Hafez. Jadid kept Douba abroad, transferring him to the Syrian embassy in Bulgaria – also as military attaché – a post that he held until 1968.\n\nHe missed the Six-Day War with Israel, which led to the occupation of the Syrian Golan, and, in 1968, was recalled to Syria and appointed director of military intelligence in Latakia.\n\nIn January 1970, he was named to the same post in Damascus and it was in that capacity that he joined ranks with Hafez al-Assad – who by then had become defence minister – helping him stage a military coup on 17 November 1970.\n\nRising in ranks under al-Assad\n\nFrom heron, Douba's career would move from one height to another. In 1971, he was named deputy head of the military intelligence branch in Syria and, in 1973, took over its full command. In 1978, he was voted into the central committee of the Ba'ath Party, at the start of a showdown between the Syrian government and the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nDouba was charged with destroying the Brotherhood's underground network and arresting its members, who had tried – and failed – to stage a revolt against the Ba'athists since 1964. They re-emerged with target assassinations starting in 1976 and Douba was prime on their hit list.\n\nHis name was permanently associated with the massive crackdown against their cadres, leading to a military confrontation in Hama in February 1982. Thousands were killed and the Muslim Brotherhood was successfully eradicated from Syria, at the expense of the city itself and a large number of innocent civilians, estimated in the thousands.\n\nUnlike other senior members of Hafez al-Assad's inner team, however, Douba was never seen in public and rarely left his office. He had no political ambition and no other life than that of his career at Syrian intelligence.\n\nRifaat coup attempt\n\nIn 1984, Douba sided with al-Assad during what British journalist Patrick Seale described as the \"Brothers War\" an attempted coup by the president's younger brother Rifaat, then commander of a special unit known as the Defence Corpse.\n\nDouba's troops took up positions throughout Damascus, with finger on trigger, ready to shoot at Rifaat's forces if ordered to do so by al-Assad, who managed to successfully defuse the crisis by naming his brother vice-president, and then sending him into open exile, first in Moscow and then to Europe.\n\nDouba played a monumental role in three major turning points. First was siding with al-Assad on the night of his coup in 1970, followed by supporting him in the showdown with the Muslim Brotherhood, and finally, in his confrontation with Rifaat al-Assad.\n\nHis unwavering loyalty led to him staying at his post and being promoted to the rank of \"imad\" in January 1993, only to be retired in January 1999 as part of a sweep that al-Assad carried out during the final months of his life, to secure a smooth transition for his son and successor, Bashar.\n\nWhen Hafez al-Assad died after 30 years in power on 10 June 2000, Douba was already a retired man at 68, but he made sure to pledge full allegiance to Syria's new 34-year-old president.\n\nHis name would re-emerge after the start of the Syrian conflict, when the EU erroneously described him as an advisor to the Syrian president and imposed sanctions on him on 24 August 2011.\n\nIn truth, Douba never returned to office after the year 1999, as his health went into a steady slump that prevented him from taking on any future duties until his death on 21 January 2023."
