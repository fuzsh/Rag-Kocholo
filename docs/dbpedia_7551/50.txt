Facebook users in Nicaragua in 2022

Data published in Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 3.45 million users in Nicaragua in early 2022.

However, Meta made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data at the end of 2021 – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here are not directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.

To learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.

The company’s revised audience figures mean that Facebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 51.2 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.

However, Facebook restricts the use of its platform to people aged 13 and above, so it’s also worth highlighting that 68.2 percent of the “eligible” audience in Nicaragua uses Facebook in 2022.

For additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 116 percent* of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2022.

At the start of 2022, 49.3 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Nicaragua was female, while 50.7 percent was male.

Note: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.

*Advisory: we’re aware that usage rates in excess of 100 percent of the population, “eligible” population, and / or internet users may seem implausible, but we’ve elected to republish source data “as is”, to enable readers to make their own judgments. Please see our detailed notes on data to learn more about these anomalies.

Data published in Meta’s advertising resources indicate that ads on Facebook Messenger reached 1.85 million users in Nicaragua in early 2022.

However, Meta made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data at the end of 2021 – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook Messenger – so the figures shown here are not directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.

To learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.

The company’s revised audience numbers suggest that Facebook Messenger’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 27.4 percent of the total population at the start of the year.

LinkedIn users in Nicaragua in 2022

Figures published in LinkedIn’s advertising resources indicate that LinkedIn had 480.0 thousand “members” in Nicaragua in early 2022.

However, note that LinkedIn’s advertising tools publish audience reach data based on total registered members, rather than the monthly active users that form the basis of the ad reach figures published by most other social media platforms.

As a result, these LinkedIn figures are not directly comparable with the figures for other social media platforms published on this page, or in our Digital 2022 reports.

The company’s advertising reach figures suggest that LinkedIn’s audience in Nicaragua was equivalent to 7.1 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.

LinkedIn restricts the use of its platform to people aged 18 and above though, so it’s also helpful to know that 10.8 percent of the “eligible” audience in Nicaragua uses LinkedIn in 2022.

For additional context, LinkedIn’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 16.1 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) at the start of the year.

However, Twitter restricts the use of its platform to people aged 13 and above, so it may be helpful to know that 4.2 percent of the “eligible” audience in Nicaragua uses Twitter in 2022.

For additional context, Twitter’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 7.2 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) at the start of the year.

Note: due to anomalies in the source data, we regret that we’re currently unable to provide insights into Twitter’s ad audience by gender.

Mobile connections in Nicaragua in 2022

However, note that many people around the world make use of more than one mobile connection – for example, they might have one connection for personal use, and another one for work – so it’s not unusual for mobile connection figures to significantly exceed figures for total population.

GSMA Intelligence’s numbers indicate that mobile connections in Nicaragua were equivalent to 121.7 percent of the total population in January 2022.

The number of mobile connections in Nicaragua increased by 340 thousand (+4.3 percent) between 2021 and 2022.
