Nicaragua population 2024

During 2024 Nicaragua population is projected to increase by 80,356 people and reach 6,977,877 in the beginning of 2025. The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 111,878. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 31,522 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Nicaragua to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).

Population change rates in 2024

According to our estimations, daily change rates of Nicaragua population in 2024 will be the following:

397 live births average per day (16.53 in an hour)

90 deaths average per day (3.76 in an hour)

-86 emigrants average per day (-3.60 in an hour)

The population of Nicaragua will be increasing by 220 persons daily in 2024.

Demographics of Nicaragua 2023

As of 1 January 2024, the population of Nicaragua was estimated to be 6,897,521 people. This is an increase of 1.17 % (79,431 people) compared to population of 6,818,090 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 110,589. Due to external migration, the population declined by 31,159. The sex ratio of the total population was 0.978 (978 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.

Nicaragua population density

Nicaragua population density is 52.9 people per square kilometer (137.0/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Nicaragua divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Nicaragua. The total area of Nicaragua is 130,370 km2 (50,336 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .

Nicaragua age structure

As of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Nicaragua had the following population age distribution:

31.7 63.8 4.5

- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+

In absolute figures (estimate):

2,183,479 young people under 15 years old ( 1,112,501 males / 1,070,978 females)

4,403,653 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 2,122,436 males / 2,281,217 females)

310,388 persons above 64 years old ( 141,399 males / 168,989 females)

We prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.

65+

15-64

0-14

male female

Note: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.

As we can see the Nicaragua population pyramid has an expanding type. This type of pyramid is common for developing countries with high birth and death rates. Relatively short life expectancy, as well as low level of education and poor health care are also describe such kind of population age distribution model.

Age dependency ratio

Dependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.

This ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.

The total dependency ratio of population in Nicaragua is 56.6 %.

What does this value mean? It shows that the dependent part of population is more than a half of the working part. It means that the working population (labor force) in Nicaragua must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons (this population is more than a half of working population). The value of more than 50% shows that the pressure on productive population in Nicaragua is relatively high.

Child dependency ratio

Child dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.

Child dependency ratio in Nicaragua is 49.6 %.

Aged dependency ratio

Aged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.

Aged dependency ratio in Nicaragua is 7 %.

Life expectancy

Life expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.

Total life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Nicaragua is 71.9 years.

This is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).

Male life expectancy at birth is 69.8 years.

Female life expectancy at birth is 74.1 years.
