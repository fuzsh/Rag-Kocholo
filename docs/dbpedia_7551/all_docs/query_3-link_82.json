        "text": "Data from the first six months from January to June of parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans shows that the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to expanding lawful pathways as an alternative to irregular migration has yielded positive results. The parole processes announced by President Biden on January 5th, building upon the successful parole process established for Venezuelans in October 2022, has significantly reduced irregular migration and denied smugglers the opportunity to exploit nearly 160,000 individuals who have instead benefitted from safe, orderly and humane pathways. Since these processes and new enforcement measures began, unlawful encounters at the Southwest Border of individuals from these countries have reduced from a seven-day average of 3,453 encounters in mid-December, to a seven-day average of 394 at the end of June, an 89 percent drop.\n\nLawful Pathways Work\n\nUp to 30,000 individuals per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) who have a U.S.-based financial supporter, pass vetting and background checks, and meet other established criteria, may be eligible to come to the United States for a period of two years and receive work authorization.\n\nThrough the end of June 2023, nearly 160,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans had arrived lawfully under the parole processes. This includes:\n\nMore than 38,000 Cubans have been vetted and approved for travel, and more than 35,000 have arrived.\n\nMore than 63,000 Haitians have been vetted and approved for travel and more than 50,000 have arrived.\n\nMore than 29,500 Nicaraguans have been vetted and approved for travel, and nearly 21,500 have arrived.\n\nMore than 58,000 Venezuelans have been approved and more than 48,500 have arrived.\n\nPotential supporters must submit a Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, on behalf of eligible CHNV nationals at uscis.gov/CHNV.\n\nIndividual supporters and representatives of organizations seeking to apply as supporters must have a lawful presence in the U.S., declare their financial support for the duration of the beneficiary’s parole period, and pass security background checks to protect against exploitation and abuse.\n\nThere are Consequences to Irregular Migration\n\nSmugglers lie to migrants, withholding information about the dangers of crossing the Darien, the dangers of extreme heat, and the consequences of trying to cross into the United States illegally.\n\nIndividuals who irregularly cross into Panama, Mexico, or the United States after May 11, 2023 are ineligible for the parole process.\n\nUnder U.S. immigration laws, consequences include a minimum 5 year bar on re-entry, losing eligibility for lawful pathways, and prosecution for repeat offenders.\n\nMexico accepts returns of up to 30,000 CHNV nationals who fail to use these lawful pathways per month.\n\nChildren under the age of 18 traveling without their parent or legal guardian are not eligible for advance authorization to travel or parole under these processes.\n\nCubans or Haitians who have been interdicted at sea after April 27, 2023 are ineligible for these processes.\n\nDHS is Calling on Partners to Help Migrants Avoid Exploitation\n\nDetails for potential supporters to submit a Form I-134A, are available at uscis.gov/CHNV.\n\nThere are no fees to be a supporter or a beneficiary for parole processes. See uscis.gov/avoid-scams for more information.\n\nMore information on protection and other lawful pathways can be found on movilidadsegura.org.\n\nRoughly half of the monthly total considered for parole processes are selected regardless of filing date, from all of the pending forms submitted for review. The other half of the monthly total is selected based on when the case was submitted under the first-in, first-out method, which prioritizes the oldest Forms I-134A for review. This is intended to maintain a meaningful and equitable opportunity for all who have a sponsor and are awaiting travel authorization through the process.\n\nMore information about the process is available in:\n\nEnglish\n\nSpanish\n\nCreole\n\nTopics\n\nBorder Security\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services\n\nKeywords\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration Reform\n\nImmigration Statistics\n\nMigration\n\nSouthwest Border\n\nSouthwest Border Coordination Center (SBCC)\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\n\nWestern Hemisphere Strategy\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nThis page was not helpful because the content\n\nhas too little information\n\nhas too much information\n\nis confusing\n\nis out-of-date"
