        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought a civic-military coalition, spearheaded by the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas led by Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador prompted the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. After losing free and fair elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA was elected president in 2006, 2011, and most recently in 2016. Municipal, regional, and national-level elections since 2008 have been marred by widespread irregularities. Democratic institutions have weakened under the ORTEGA administration as the president has garnered full control over all branches of government, especially after cracking down on a nationwide antigovernment protest movement in 2018.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean, between Costa Rica and Honduras\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 00 N, 85 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 130,370 sq km\n\nland: 119,990 sq km\n\nwater: 10,380 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 99\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Pennsylvania; slightly smaller than New York state\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,253 km\n\nborder countries (2): Costa Rica 313 km, Honduras 940 km\n\nCoastline\n\n910 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\ncontinental shelf: natural prolongation\n\nClimate\n\ntropical in lowlands, cooler in highlands\n\nTerrain\n\nextensive Atlantic coastal plains rising to central interior mountains; narrow Pacific coastal plain interrupted by volcanoes\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 298 m\n\nlowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Mogoton 2,085 m\n\nNatural resources\n\ngold, silver, copper, tungsten, lead, zinc, timber, fish\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 42.2% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 12.5% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 2.5% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 27.2% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 25.3% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 32.5% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,990 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population resides in the western half of the country, with much of the urban growth centered in the capital city of Managua; coastal areas also show large population clusters\n\nNatural hazards\n\ndestructive earthquakes; volcanoes; landslides; extremely susceptible to hurricanes volcanism: significant volcanic activity; Cerro Negro (728 m), which last erupted in 1999, is one of Nicaragua's most active volcanoes; its lava flows and ash have been known to cause significant damage to farmland and buildings; other historically active volcanoes include Concepcion, Cosiguina, Las Pilas, Masaya, Momotombo, San Cristobal, and Telica\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ndeforestation; soil erosion; water pollution; drought\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nlargest country in Central America; contains the largest freshwater body in Central America, Lago de Nicaragua\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n6,085,213 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 111\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Nicaraguan(s)\n\nadjective: Nicaraguan\n\nEthnic groups\n\nmestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 69%, white 17%, black 9%, Amerindian 5%\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish (official) 95.3%, Miskito 2.2%, Mestizo of the Caribbean coast 2%, other 0.5% (2005 est.)\n\nnote: English and indigenous languages found on the Caribbean coast\n\nReligions\n\nRoman Catholic 50%, Evangelical 33.2%, other 2.9%, unspecified 13.2%, none 0.7% (2017 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nDespite being one of the poorest countries in Latin America, Nicaragua has improved its access to potable water and sanitation and has ameliorated its life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and immunization rates. However, income distribution is very uneven, and the poor, agriculturalists, and indigenous people continue to have less access to healthcare services. Nicaragua's total fertility rate has fallen from around 6 children per woman in 1980 to below replacement level today, but the high birth rate among adolescents perpetuates a cycle of poverty and low educational attainment.Nicaraguans emigrate primarily to Costa Rica and to a lesser extent the United States. Nicaraguan men have been migrating seasonally to Costa Rica to harvest bananas and coffee since the early 20th century. Political turmoil, civil war, and natural disasters from the 1970s through the 1990s dramatically increased the flow of refugees and permanent migrants seeking jobs, higher wages, and better social and healthcare benefits. Since 2000, Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica has slowed and stabilized. Today roughly 300,000 Nicaraguans are permanent residents of Costa Rica - about 75% of the foreign population - and thousands more migrate seasonally for work, many illegally.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 26.65%(male 827,585 /female 794,086)\n\n15-24 years: 20.67%(male 632,847 /female 624,811)\n\n25-54 years: 41.04%(male 1,186,467 /female 1,310,957)\n\n55-64 years: 6.19%(male 173,674 /female 202,765)\n\n65 years and over: 5.46%(male 147,324 /female 184,697) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 54.1 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 46.3 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 7.8 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 12.8 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 26.2 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 25.3 years\n\nfemale: 27.1 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 150\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.97% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 113\n\nBirth rate\n\n17.5 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 101\n\nDeath rate\n\n5.2 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 191\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-2.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 172\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the population resides in the western half of the country, with much of the urban growth centered in the capital city of Managua;

GDP growth of 4.5% in 2017 was insufficient to make a significant difference. Textiles and agriculture combined account for nearly 50% of Nicaragua's exports. Beef, coffee, and gold are Nicaragua’s top three export commodities.The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement has been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export opportunities for many Nicaraguan agricultural and manufactured goods.In 2013, the government granted a 50-year concession with the option for an additional 50 years to a newly formed Chinese-run company to finance and build an inter-oceanic canal and related projects, at an estimated cost of $50 billion. The canal construction has not started.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$36.4 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$34.71 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$33.17 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 124\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$13.81 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n4.9% (2017 est.)\n\n4.7% (2016 est.)\n\n4.8% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 54\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$5,900 (2017 est.)\n\n$5,600 (2016 est.)\n\n$5,500 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 165\n\nGross national saving\n\n24% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n23.2% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n23.6% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 69\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 69.9% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 15.3% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 28.1% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 1.7% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 41.2% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -55.4% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 15.5% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 24.4% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 60% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoffee, bananas, sugarcane, rice, corn, tobacco, cotton, sesame, soya, beans, beef, veal, pork, poultry, dairy products, shrimp, lobsters, peanuts\n\nIndustries\n\nfood processing, chemicals, machinery and metal products, knit and woven apparel, petroleum refining and distribution, beverages, footwear, wood, electric wire harness manufacturing, mining\n\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n3.5% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 88\n\nLabor force\n\n3.046 million (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 103\n\nLabor force - by occupation\n\nagriculture: 31%\n\nindustry: 18%\n\nservices: 50% (2011 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n6.4% (2017 est.)\n\n6.2% (2016 est.)\n\nnote: underemployment was 46.5% in 2008\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 95\n\nPopulation below poverty line\n\n29.6% (2015 est.)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share\n\nlowest 10%: 1.8%\n\nhighest 10%: 47.1% (2014)\n\nDistribution of family income - Gini index\n\n47.1 (2014)\n\n45.8 (2009)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 27\n\nBudget\n\nrevenues: 3.871 billion (2017 est.)\n\nexpenditures: 4.15 billion (2017 est.)\n\nTaxes and other revenues\n\n28% (of GDP) (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 97\n\nBudget surplus (+) or deficit (-)\n\n-2% (of GDP) (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 106\n\nPublic debt\n\n33.3% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n31.2% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\nnote: official data;
