In this context, detailed and contemporary datasets accurately describing the distribution of residential population in the region are required for measuring the impacts of population growth, monitoring changes, supporting environmental and health applications, and planning interventions. To support these needs, an open access archive of high-resolution gridded population datasets was created through disaggregation of the most recent ofcial population count data available for 28 countries located in the region. These datasets are described here along with the approach and methods used to create and validate them. For each country, population distribution datasets, having a resolution of 3 arc seconds (approximately 100 m at the equator), were produced for the population count year, as well as for 2010, 2015, and 2020. All these products are available both through the WorldPop Project website and the WorldPop Dataverse Repository.\n\nDesign Type(s) data integration objective database creation objective time series design\n\nMeasurement Type(s) population\n\nTechnology Type(s) census\n\nFactor Type(s)\n\nSample Characteristic(s)\n\n1Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, Higheld Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.\n\n2Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Higheld Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK. 3GeoData, University of Southampton, Higheld Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK. 4Department of Geography and Geosciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA. 5Lutte biologique et Ecologie spatiale (LUBIES), Universit Libre de Bruxelles, CP 160/12, 50 Avenue F.D.

Its population, which increased by 1.5 times over the last 25 years, is expected to grow by another 25% and further urbanize by 2050, with 86% living in urban areas1.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organization2, health and demographic indicators highlight that, although with signicant variation from country to country and to a far lower degree than Africa and central Asia, the region is characterized by relatively high maternal and infant mortality rates, and a lack of access to health facilities and services for a large part of its population. In addition, many endemic infectious diseases are also present and include malaria, dengue, chikungunya, chagas, and leishmaniasis3,4. Furthermore, low and middle income countries located in the region are highly vulnerable to and affected by natural and man-made disasters5 and, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change6, the frequency and intensity of weather- and water-related hazards are expected to rise in the upcoming decades, both globally and regionally, as a consequence of climate change. Finally, the rapid development of the region and its ongoing urbanization is expected to further exacerbate problems related to the rapid land-use change and deforestation in rural areas7 and the growth of informal settlements in urban areas8.\n\nIn this context, contemporary, spatially detailed, and comparable datasets that accurately depict the distribution of the residential human population are a fundamental prerequisite for measuring the impacts of population growth9, monitoring changes10, supporting environmental and health applications11,12, and planning interventions13. Nevertheless, for the majority of these countries, and especially for those most severely and disproportionately affected by both natural disaster and infectious disease morbidity, contemporary, spatially detailed, consistent, and open data on population distribution are often unavailable or difcult to obtain.\n\nFor these reasons, since the mid-1990s, there has been an increasing effort to create spatially-explicit population datasets by using a range of approaches, assumptions, and input data to disaggregate administrative unit-based population counts to a regular grid of xed spatial resolution14. Current global gridded datasets depicting the distribution of human population across the Latin America and the Caribbean region include various versions of the Gridded Population of the World (GPW)1518, the\n\nGlobal Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)19, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's LandScan20, and the United Nation Environment Programme Latin American and Caribbean Population Database21.\n\nHowever, these datasets present certain limitations due to their spatial resolution ranging between 30 and 150 arc seconds (approximately 1 and 5 km at the equator, respectively), the age and coarse spatial detail of the input population count data, or the lack of details on the input data and modelling approach used to produce them22,23.\n\nIn the framework of the WorldPop Project (http://www.worldpop.org\n\nWeb End =www.worldpop.org), an open access archive of high-resolution gridded population distribution datasets for the Latin America and the Caribbean region has been created using the most recent and nest level census and ofcial population estimate data available at the time of writing, along with a range of ancillary geospatial datasets depicting factors known to relate to human population presence and densities. Following the Random Forest (RF)-based dasymetric mapping approach developed by Stevens et al.24 (Fig. 1), population count data and ancillary datasets for 28 countries (Tables 1 and 2) were identied, collected, assembled, and exploited in order to produce gridded population datasets with a spatial resolution of 3 arc seconds (approximately 100 m at the equator). These datasets were produced for the population count year, as well as for 2010, 2015, and 2020 using the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) rural and urban growth rates25; with national totals for 2010, 2015, and 2020 both remaining unadjusted and being adjusted to match UNPD estimates25.\n\nMethods\n\nRandom forest-based dasymetric population mapping approach\n\nThe dasymetric disaggregation of population counts from administrative units into grid cells was undertaken using a population density weighting layer generated by a RF algorithm. RF is a non-linear and non-parametric ensemble learning method that generates a large collection of unpruned decision tree models and aggregates their predictions. Each tree is independently generated by bagging (i.e., by bootstrapping with replacement)26, and each node of each tree is split using the optimal split among a randomly selected subset of covariates27. Outputs of all tree models are then aggregated by calculating either their mode or average, depending on whether the decision trees are used for classication or regression.\n\nThe RF method is robust to overtting27 and not very sensitive, in terms of affecting prediction accuracy, to the three parameters required to be set for tting the model28, namely (i) the number of covariates to be randomly selected at each node, (ii) the number of observations in the terminal nodes of each trees, and (iii) the number of trees in the forest. Furthermore, it is possible to accurately estimate the prediction error of the RF model. This can be done by averaging all mean squared errors calculated using the out-of-bag (OOB) data that represent one third of the observations withheld from the bagging iteration process for each tree in the forest27. The OOB error can be also used to evaluate the importance of each covariate by considering how much the OOB error increases when only the OOB data for that given covariate are permuted28,29.\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 2\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\nExtract population counts from the most recent official population census, estimate, or projection\n\nMatch the extracted population counts to their corresponding administrative units\n\nCalculate population density at the administrative unit level\n\nCalculate covariate values at the administrative unit level\n\nSupplement and/or replace default covariates with additional and/or better country-specific covariates\n\nProcess a number of global default datasets highly correlated with population density into a set of default raster covariates\n\nFit a Random Forests model using population density and covariates both calculated at the administrative unit level\n\nPredict population density at the grid cell level using the fitted Random Forests model and the raster covariates\n\nUse the predicted population density to dasymetrically disaggregate population counts from administrative units into grid cells\n\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the Random Forest (RF)-based dasymetric mapping approach used to produce the WorldPop Americas datasets (modied from Stevens et al.24). The preparation of the response variable and covariates is described in the yellow and orange panels, respectively, the RF modelling steps are outlined in in the green panels, and the disaggregation of the input population counts from administrative units into grid cells is described in the blue panel.\n\nIn the RF-based dasymetric population mapping approach developed by Stevens et al.24, a RF algorithm is used to generate gridded population density estimates that are subsequently used to dasymetrically disaggregate population counts from administrative units into grid cells. The same approach was used to produce the WorldPop Americas datasets described in this article. Initially, a population density response variable and a suite of covariates were calculated at the administrative unit level, and then used to t a RF model for predicting population density at the grid cell level (i.e., to generate the dasymetric weighting layer) with those raster-based covariates having a spatial resolution of 100 m (Fig. 2).\n\nTo reduce processing time during the prediction phase, the multi-stage RF estimation technique developed by Stevens et al.24 was used. This technique rst ts a model using all available covariates and the (log) population density of each administrative unit as the response. Then, a very conservative covariate selection process is performed to reduce the number of covariates that will be used for both the RF model tting and prediction. To do this the variable importance of each covariate27 is extracted and each covariate that has a score equal to zero is removed before re-tting the RF model. This process is then iterated until only covariates with positive scores remain and thus results in the elimination of both redundant covariates and covariates that could negatively impact the prediction.\n\nAs in Stevens et al.24, the RF model tting was performed by generating 500 trees in the forest and setting the number of observations in the terminal nodes equal to one. The tted RF model was then used to predict population density using only the same reduced set of covariates. For each grid cell, each regression tree in the forest was used to predict a population density value and the average of all predictions was assigned to it as its estimated population density value. If there were not enough observations (i.e., not enough administrative unit population counts) to t a RF model for a given country, another country located in the same ecozone30 was identied and used to t an appropriate RF model for predicting population density at the grid cell level31.\n\nSubsequently, in both cases, the population density weighting layer was used to dasymetrically disaggregate the administrative unit-based population counts32 and produce two gridded population datasets depicting the estimated number of people per grid square and per hectare for the population count year. These datasets were then projected to 2010 (Fig. 3), 2015, and 2020 using UNPD rural and urban growth rates25 and also adjusted to match the most recent UNPD estimates at the time of writing25.\n\nAll tasks described above were entirely performed using the WordPop-RF code (Data Citation 1) described in the Code availability section below and publicly available through the gshare repository. In particular, the code relies on the R statistical environment (version 2.15) and the randomForest package (version 4.67) for tting the RF model at the administrative unit level and predict at the grid cell level, and on the Python programming language (version 2.6; http://www.python.org\n\nWeb End =www.python.org ) and ArcGIS 10.1 arcpy package for performing the Geographic Information System (GIS)-specic spatial operations required for\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 3\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\nPopulation data source Units data source\n\nATG 436 81,799 2011 8 Parish/1 2.6 Census Ofce GADM ARG 2,804,771 40,117,096 2010 526 Department/2 3.2 INDEC IGN BLZ 21,918 312,971 2010 16 Subdivision/1 9.3 Statistical Institute of Belize Meerman BOL 1,069,327 10,027,262 2012 112 Province/2 9.2 INE GADM BRA 8,233,131 190,732,694 2010 5565 Municipality/3 0.6 IBGE IBGE CHL 756,096 16,341,929 2012 297 Municipality/3 2.9 INE-CELADE GADM COL 1,141,261 47,661,787 2013 1115 Municipality/2 1.0 Departamento Administrativo\n\nNacional de Estadstica\n\nISO code Area (sqkm) Total population Year No. of units Unit name/level Average spatial\n\nresolution\n\nGADM\n\nCRI 51,100 4,301,712 2011 469 District/3 0.5 INEC GADM CUB 109,884 11,167,325 2012 168 Municipality/2 2.0 ONE GADM DOM 48,070 9,445,281 2010 155 Municipality/3 1.4 ONE GADM ECU 257,320 14,483,499 2010 978 Parish/4 0.5 INEC GADM SLV 21,045 5,744,113 2007 267 Municipality/2 0.5 Direccin General de Estadstica y Censos GADM GUF 83,534 231,167 2010 21 Municipality/3 13.8 Insee GADM GTM 108,201 15,073,375 2012 335 Municipality/2 1.0 INE GADM GUY 214,999 751,223 2002 116 Council/2 4.0 Statistics Guyana GADM HTI 26,964 9,923,243 2009 570 Section/4 0.3 IHSI GADM HND 112,457 8,045,990 2010 298 Municipality/2 1.1 INE GADM JAM 10,991 2,697,983 2011 14 Parish/1 7.5 Statistical Institute GADM MEX 19,67,138 112,336,538 2010 2456 Municipality/2 0.6 INEGI Valle-Jones NIC 120,340 6,071,045 2012 139 Municipality/3 2.5 INIDE GADM PAN 741,77 3,405,813 2010 77 District/2 3.5 Direccin de Estadstica y Censo GADM PRY 406,752 3,725,789 2002 247 Municipality/2 2.6 Direccin General de Estadstica,\n\nEncuestas y Censos\n\nTable 1.

Table 1 also provides summary information about the input population count data and administrative unit datasets used to produce the WorldPop Americas datasets.\n\nIt is well known that human population density is highly correlated with environmental and physical factors35 that can plausibly impact the spatial distribution of population and/or be related to it. These may include continuous variables such as intensity of night-time lights36, energy productivity of plants37, topographic elevation and slope38,39, and climatic factors40, as well as categorical variables such as land-cover type41 and presence/absence of roads42, waterways and waterbodies43, human settlements and\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 4\n\nGADM\n\nPER 1,294,681 30,135,875 2012 194 Province/2 5.9 INEI GADM PRI 13,790 3,725,789 2010 78 Municipality/1 1.5 U.S. Census Bureau GADM SUR 163,820 541,638 2004 62 Resort/2 6.5 Algemeen Bureau voor de Statistiek GADM TTO 5127 1,328,019 2011 14 Municipality/1 5.1 Central Statistical Ofce GADM URY 175,016 3,286,314 2011 19 Department/1 22.0 INE GADM VEN 913,982 28,946,101 2011 344 Municipality/2 2.8 INE GADM\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\nDefault dataset Default derived covariate Temporal coverage Type Format Resolution Source Suomi NPP-VIIRS 2012 Continuous Raster 15 arc seconds NOAA\n\nNight-lights intensity 2012 Continuous Raster 100 mMODIS Net Primary Production 2014/2015 Continuous Raster 30 arc seconds NASA\n\nPlants energy productivity 2014/2015 Continuous Raster 100 mWorldClim (BIO ) 19502000 Continuous Raster 30 arc seconds Hijmans et al.\n\nAnnual Mean Temperature 19502000 Continuous Raster 100 mWorldClim (BIO ) 19502000 Continuous Raster 30 arc seconds Hijmans et al. .\n\nAnnual Precipitation 19502000 Continuous Raster 100 m HydroSheds (3 s GRID: Void-lled DEM) 2000 Continuous Raster 3 arc seconds WWF\n\nElevation 2000 Continuous Raster 100 mSlope 2000 Continuous Raster 100 mMERIS GlobCover 2009 Categorical Raster 10 arc seconds ESA\n\nPresence/absence of class # 2000/2009 Categorical (binary) Raster 100 m Distance to class # 2000/2009 Continuous Raster 100 m Proportion of class # 2000/2009 Continuous Raster 100 m Presence/absence of built-up areas (BLT) 2000/2009 Categorical (binary) Raster 100 m Distance to built-up areas (BLT) 2000/2009 Continuous Raster 100 m Proportion of built-up area (BLT)\n\nMODIS 500 m Global Urban Extent 2000/2001 Categorical (binary) Raster 15 arc seconds Schneider et al.\n\nPresence/absence of urban areas 2000/2001 Categorical (binary) Raster 100 mDistance to urban areas 2000/2001 Continuous Raster 100 mProportion of urban area 2000/2001 Continuous Raster 100 mWorld Database on Protected Areas 2012 Categorical Vector UNEP-WCMC & IUCN\n\nPresence/absence of protected areas 2012 Categorical (binary) Raster 100 m Distance to protected areas 2012 Continuous Raster 100 m Proportion of protected area 2012 Continuous Raster 100 m VMAP0 populated places/roads/\n\nrivers/waterbodies\n\nPresence/absence of populated places/roads/\n\nrivers/waterbodies\n\nTable 2.

For illustrative purpose, only 4 out of the 74 covariates considered for Puerto Rico are shown here (the uninhabited Puerto Rican islands of Mona, Monito, and Desecheo are not shown).\n\nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Vector Map Level 0 (VMAP0) dataset60 was used to obtain features representing populated places, roads, rivers, and waterbodies.\n\nWhere available, additional country-specic datasets were used to integrate and/or replace the default datasets outlined above and the corresponding default covariates in the analysis. For example, for most of the countries, the Landsat TM-based EarthSat GeoCover-LC raster dataset61,62 was combined with the\n\nGlobCover raster dataset to rene the extent of urban areas and identify rural settlements. Similarly, OpenStreetMap (OSM) vector datasets63 were regularly used to integrate the VMAP0 settlement dataset and account for land-use types, building sites, and locations of points of interest that may be strongly correlated with population presence (e.g., health clinics, schools, and police stations). Furthermore, OSM road and river data were often deemed to be more complete than the corresponding VMAP0 data and, thus, were used to increase the precision and accuracy of the gridded population outputs64.\n\nFor each country, all assembled vector and raster datasets, including the country specic ones, are described in the metadata le accompanying the corresponding gridded population datasets and viewable in any web-browser (refer to the Data Record section below for a more detailed description of the metadata le content).\n\nData preparation\n\nFor each country, the vector dataset representing its administrative units, used to match to population counts, was projected using the most appropriate country-specic projected coordinate system that minimized linear and areal distortion. It was then buffered by 10 km, and rasterized at a spatial resolution of 100 m. This was done in order to (i) generate a dataset representing the population density response variable, (ii) obtain a raster dataset, representing the study area, for co-registering all raster covariates, and (iii) produce a number of raster distance to covariates that were unaffected by edge effects due to the fact that the study area is articially bounded while spatial processes are not65. The population density response variable was obtained through dividing population counts by the area of the corresponding administrative units, and log-transforming the results to normalize the response variable distribution.\n\nCovariates for input to the RF method were derived as follows. First, a continuous raster dataset representing the spatial variation of topographic slope was derived from the USGS HydroSheds dataset (Table 2). Then, all raster datasets representing continuous variables, including the latter, were projected, resampled to 100 m resolution, co-registered and matched to the rasterized buffered study area. For all covariates, NoData grid cells overlapping the rasterized buffered study area were lled with the values of the nearest neighbours (using the Nibble tool available in ArcGIS 10.1). All vector and raster datasets representing categorical variables were projected, rasterized to or resampled to 100 m resolution, co-registered, matched to the rasterized buffered study area, and converted into a number of binary raster covariates, representing presence/absence of a given feature, that were subsequently used to produce continuous distance to and proportion of raster covariates (Table 2); with the latter representing, within a 500 m buffer from each grid cell, the proportion of grid cells where the given feature is present.\n\nA special case of a categorical raster dataset is the land-cover data. Indeed, in this case land-cover classes must be aggregated (if needed) and recoded to match the ten WorlPop Americas classes derived\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 6\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\n1200'0\"W\n\n1100'0\"W\n\n1000'0\"W\n\n900'0\"W\n\n800'0\"W\n\n700'0\"W\n\n600'0\"W\n\n500'0\"W\n\n400'0\"W\n\n1:3,500,000\n\nPeople per grid cellHighest\n\nLowest\n\n300'0\"N 200'0\"N 100'0\"N 00'0\" 100'0\"S 200'0\"S 300'0\"S 400'0\"S 500'0\"S\n\nb)\n\n1:8,800,000\n\na)\n\n1:13,000,000\n\n1:22,500,000\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n1:6,000,000\n\n1:26,000,000 0 2,000\n\n1,000\n\nKm\n\nFigure 3.

The grid cell resolution is 3 arc seconds (approximately 100 m at the equator) and coordinates refer to GCS WGS 1984. For illustrative purpose, the color ranges used are country-specic.\n\nfrom the GlobCover dataset (i.e., from class 11 to 230 in the 4th column of Supplementary Table 1). By default, the recoded GlobCover dataset was Nibbled, to ll in any missing grid cell, and then mosaicked with the MODIS 500 m Global Urban Extent dataset to delineate the extent of urban and non-urban built-up areas (i.e., class 190 and 240 respectively in Supplementary Table 1). When using the GeoCover-LC dataset, it was rst recoded and mosaicked with the GlobCover dataset, to ll missing grid cell, and with the MODIS 500 m Global Urban Extent dataset. Similarly to the other raster datasets representing categorical variables, the processed land-cover raster dataset obtained as described above was projected, resampled to 100 m resolution, co-registered, matched to the rasterized buffered study area, and converted into twelve binary raster covariates including the combined built-up areas class (BLT) obtained by combining classes 190 and 240. Binary raster covariates were subsequently used to produce continuous distance to and proportion of raster covariates (Table 2). Finally, average and modal values for continuous and binary covariates, respectively, were calculated for each administrative unit and used for tting the RF model.\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 7\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\nThe preparation of the population density response variable and raster covariates was entirely performed using the WordPop-RF code (Data Citation 1) described in the Code availability section below and publicly available through the gshare repository. In particular, the code relies on the Python programming language (version 2.6; http://www.python.org\n\nWeb End =www.python.org ) and ArcGIS 10.1 arcpy package for performing the GIS-specic spatial operations required for preparing both the response variable and raster covariates (refer to the Supplementary File 1 for a technical description of how the GIS-specic spatial operations are implemented). For each country, all derived covariates are listed in the metadata le accompanying the corresponding gridded population datasets (refer to the Data Record section below for a more detailed description of the metadata le contents).\n\nCode availability\n\nThe WordPop-RF code (Data Citation 1), used to produce the WorldPop Americas datasets, as well as the metadata and the KML les associated with them (refer to the Data Records section for a description of the latter), is publicly available through the gshare repository. The code consists of two Python (version 2.6; http://www.python.org\n\nWeb End =www.python.org ) and four R (version 2.15.3) programming language scripts that must be run sequentially in the following order: 1) 01.0Conguration.py.R; 2) Metadata.R; 3) 01.1Data Preparation, R.r; 4) 01.2Data Preparation, Python.py; 5) 01.3More Complex Random Forest Regression, Full Covariate Set and Data Preparation.r; 6) 01.4Process Density Weights to Population Maps.py; 7) 01.5Generate KML.r; 8) 01.6Generate Metadata Report.r.

The OOB error and the percentage of variance explained are provided for all 28 countries while the RMSE, the %RMSE, and the MAE values are provided for six countries. RF and SAW, in the 2nd column, indicate that, for that specic country, the population counts at the administrative unit level were disaggregated using the RF-based dasymetric mapping approach and the simple areal-weighting approach, respectively.\n\nSCIENTIFIC DATA | 2:150045 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.45 9\n\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\n\nbased, (ii) its prediction error, (iii) the relative importance of each covariate, (iv) the prediction intervals using the OOB data (refer to the Methods section for additional information about the latter features).\n\nTechnical Validation\n\nRoot mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)\n\nSix countries, located in different parts of the Latin American and the Caribbean region were selected to assess the increased accuracy of the RF-based dasymetric mapping approach with respect to a simple areal-weighting (SAW) approach66 (Table 4). For each selected country, population counts were aggregated within the next coarser administrative level boundary than the nest for which they were available (e.g., if admin level 4 population count data were available, these were aggregated to admin level 3). The coarser, aggregated population counts were then used to produce gridded population count datasets, with a resolution of 100 m, using both the SAW and the RF approach outlined here. Finally, the two different population estimates produced using these approaches within each of the nest administrative unit were calculated, and compared with observed population gure referring to the same higher resolution unit.\n\nResults, summarized in Table 4, show how both the RMSE, the %RMSE (RMSE expressed as a percentage of the average population of the nest administrative unit level), and the MAE values (5th, 6th, and 7th column of Table 4, respectively) calculated using the RF-based outputs are consistently lower than the corresponding values calculated for the SAW outputs. These statistics can be used to compare the accuracy of the two approaches when downscaling the estimates.\n\nOut-of-bag (OOB) error estimation\n\nThe OOB error estimate (3rd column of Table 4), as already briey described in the Methods section, is internally calculated during the RF model tting and can be considered a robust and unbiased measurement of the prediction accuracy of the model itself27.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that since the RF model is tted at the administrative unit level and then is used to predict at the grid cell level, the OOB error estimate should not be interpreted as the prediction error at the grid cell level. Similarly, it does not represent the prediction error that could be expected to be observed at the administrative unit level by summing all nal grid cell values within each administrative unit and comparing it to the observed population count referring to the same administrative unit. However, referring to the six countries mentioned in the previous section, by comparing the OOB error estimates calculated at the aggregate lower administrative unit level than the highest available (3rd column of Table 4) with the corresponding RMSE and MAE values (5th and 7th column of Table 3, respectively), it is reasonable to expect that higher accuracy of predicted values at the administrative unit level results in a higher accuracy of the nal gridded population distribution datasets24.\n\nUsage Notes\n\nThe WorldPop Americas datasets can be used both to support applications for planning interventions, measuring progress, and to predict response variables intrinsically dependent on the population distribution. However, considering that they represent modelling outputs generated using ancillary covariate datasets in the disaggregation process, to avoid circularity, they should not be used to make predictions or explore relationships about any of these ancillary datasets14. Thus, before using WorldPop Americas datasets in correlation analyses against factors which are included in the process of their construction (e.g., correlating population distribution with land-cover), ideally the population modelling process should be re-run using the WordPop-RF code (Data Citation 1) with the covariate of interest being removed to avoid issues relating to endogeneity.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
