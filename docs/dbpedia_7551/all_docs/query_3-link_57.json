        "text": "Pre-trial/remand prison population: trend\n\nThe table below gives an indication of the recent trend in the pre-trial/remand prison population. The final row shows the latest figures available.\n\nIt consists of the number of pre-trial/remand prisoners in the prison population on a single date in the year (or the annual average) and the percentage of the total prison population that pre-trial/remand prisoners constituted on that day.\n\nThe final column shows the pre-trial/remand population rate per 100,000 of the national population.\n\nNICARAGUA\n\nIt should be noted that the number of pre-trial/remand prisoners fluctuates from day to day, month to month and year to year. Consequently the above figures give an indication of the trend but the picture is inevitably incomplete.\n\nThe pre-trial/remand population rate is calculated on the basis of the national population total. All national population figures are inevitably estimates but the estimates used in the World Prison Brief are based on official national figures, United Nations figures or figures from other recognised international authorities."
