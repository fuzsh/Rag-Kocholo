        "text": "The first missionaries arrived in Nicaragua in 1953. The first convert was baptized the following year. In September 1978, civil war forced missionaries to leave the area. Work resumed in the late 1980s. In 1987, a group of Church members traveled by bus to visit the Guatemala City Temple.\n\nMembership was approximately 3,500 when the Nicaragua Managua Mission was organized in October 1989. Membership increased to 8,000 by December 1990.\n\nFor Journalist Use Only"
