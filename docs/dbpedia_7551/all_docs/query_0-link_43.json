BANK CREDITS TO FOREIGNERS 361 o utstanding foreign credits of banks in the United States rose by more than $2 billion last year, almost twice as much as in any other recent year. After the summer, the outflow accelerated. Net extensions of short-term loans and acceptance credits rose to rates that were above the peaks of late 1960 and of late 1961, and net extensions of long-term credits climbed further above the record rate of 1963. Moreover, beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing into early 1965, commitments on new long-term loans were being made at nearly double the rate of the first half of the year. These commitments pointed to a continuation of extraordinary outflows of long-term loans. CHART 1 Outstanding BANK LOANS AND ACCEPTANCES to f o r e i g n e r s rise s h a r p l y i n ' 6 4 ; a t y e a r - e n d t h e y t o t a l e d $ 9 billion BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUAL CHANGES — 2 TOTAL — 1 LONG-TERM SHORT-TERM 1962 1963 NOTE.—Long-term bank loans and short-term loans and acceptance credits by banks in the United States. (Other short-term claims on foreigners of these banks were approximately $1 billion at end of 1964.) The change in outstanding long-term loans in 1961 has been adjusted to exclude one transaction included in the balance of payments as direct investment. The very large increase in foreign lending after mid-1963 occurred in an environment of sustained expansion in domestic output and of a U.S. monetary policy that provided for a moderate but steady growth in commercial bank reserves. Although reserves were supplied a little less freely beginning last summer, the impact on foreign lending of this modest shift in emphasis of monetary policy was outweighed by strong foreign demand pressures and by the growing interest of U.S. banks in such lending. Demands for short-term credits have been particularly strong from Japan and less developed countries. At the same time, European industrial countries as well as Japan have shown increasing interest in obtaining long-term credits from U.S. banks. FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 362 After the proposal for an interest equalization tax on foreign securities in mid-1963, borrowers in industrial countries—apart from Canada, for which an exception was made under the tax law —ceased their efforts to obtain long-term U.S. funds through offerings of new bond issues to U.S. investors. In a general sense, long-term loans from U.S. banks have substituted for these foreign bond issues. Even though the individual borrowers from banks were not necessarily the ones that had been offering bonds, their countries still obtained both foreign exchange and long-term funds. Moreover, late in 1964 an increasing portion of these term loans appeared to be direct substitutes for bond financing. But for most countries the growing amounts obtained through long-term bank loans have far exceeded the amounts they had previously obtained through bond issues in the United States. Mushrooming foreign demands for long-term bank credits in late 1964, and especially during the first 6 weeks of this year, represented in part efforts to obtain funds before the expected issuance of a Presidential order making such credits subject to the interest equalization tax, as provided in the Gore amendment to the tax law. The flood of lending abroad by U.S. banks was a major element in the record $6 billion outflow of U.S. private capital in 1964. The upsurge in capital outflows offset an increased export surplus on goods and services and prevented any improvement in the U.S. payments position ifr the first 9 months of the year over the level of the second half of 1963. And the large fourth-quarter outflow, only part of which was attributable to temporary factors, brought the over-all payments deficit for the year 1964 to $3 billion, little lower than in the previous year. In this situation, President Johnson sent to the Congress on February 10 a message proposing a balance of payments program to achieve a substantial reduction in the deficit in 1965 and further improvement in 1966. The program called for intensive efforts by Government and by the business and banking communities. GROWING FOREIGN ACTIVITY BY BANKS _,, , „ £ f , t. . ., credit extensions to residents of foreign countries has been accounted for by the large U.S. banks that have long been active in the foreign field—accepting foreign official and private deposits, making investments in this country for foreign customers, and extending credit abroad. But since the early 1960's an increasing number of banks have been developing their international business. As a result foreign lending has become somewhat more widely distributed throughout the banking system and the country than in earlier years. Evidence of the widened interest of U.S. banks in foreign lending is found in the number of banks that have established sub- BANK CREDITS TO FOREIGNERS sidiary corporations, under Sections 25 and 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, to engage in international banking or finance. At the end of 1961, there were 10 commercial banks operating such subsidiaries (termed Edge Act or Agreement corporations). Six of these banks were in New York City. Within 2 years, the number of banks had increased to 19, and last year 3 more banks established Edge Act subsidiaries. All but one of the banks that have formed Edge Act subsidiaries since 1961 have their head offices outside New York City. Moreover, some banks that have not established Edge Act subsidiaries have increased the number of officers in their international departments relatively as much as have those with such subsidiaries. As banks have enlarged their international staffs, they have increased both their ability to develop foreign business and their interest in securing a larger volume of such business. Expanded international departments have acquired a greater voice in the allocation of funds available to commercial banks, and some foreign loans that might once have been regarded by bank officers as marginal have been given a higher priority. As the number of banks active in foreign lending has increased so too has competition, and this has stimulated efforts to attract new foreign customers, as well as to retain old ones. The spread of foreign lending through the banking system in the past 2 years has been greater for short-term loans and acceptance credits than for long-term loans. Banks in the New York Federal Reserve District, whose activities have contributed importantly through the years to the role of New York City as the leading international financial center, accounted for three-fourths of the total outstanding short-term claims on foreigners reported by banks in the United States at the end of 1962, but for only a little more than half of the increase in 1963 and 1964. They accounted for more than three-fourths of the outstanding long-term loans at the end of 1962, and for only slightly less than this proportion of the marked expansion in these credits since that time. LONG-TERM LOANS A sharp upsurge in long-term bank lending to foreigners in 1963 marked a shift in the pattern of such lending. In earlier years net outflows of long-term loans had been moderate—in the range of $100 million to $200 million annually—and credits had been distributed among both industrial and less developed countries. But in the second quarter of 1963—before announcement of the interest equalization tax on foreign securities could have increased foreigners' incentives to seek bank financing—the outflow spurted to an annual rate of about $600 million, and the 363 364 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 increase represented primarily a rise in credits to industrial countries in Europe and to Japan. The rate of outflow on these credits advanced somewhat further over the balance of 1963 and early 1964, with wide quarter-toquarter variations. And in late 1964, after passage of the interest equalization tax law, there was yet further growth in the outflow on credits to industrial countries. This most recent increase was coupled with a new increase in net outflows to less developed countries. Moreover, information received through early 1965 from commercial banks on their commitments to make long-term loans indicated that these outflows were likely to continue at extraordinarily high levels. CHART 2 W I T H U P S U R G E I N C O M M I T M E N T S , d i s b u r s e m e n t s on l o n g - t e r m b a n k loans to f o r e i g n e r s show sharp rise MILLIONS OF DOLLARS — 800 1964 QUARTERS NOTE.—Commitments on long-term bank loans are U.S. Treasury data. Foreign demands. Demands of borrowers in foreign industrial countries for long-term funds from sources outside their own countries have been strong and persistent in recent years. Before the proposal for the interest equalization tax in July 1963, European and Japanese governmental institutions and private companies were offering an increasing volume of new bond issues in the U.S. market. After the tax proposal effectively eliminated their interest in tapping U.S. funds through security issues in this country, there was accelerated development of the market for external bond issues in European countries, some of which were denominated in dollars and some in foreign currencies. BANK CREDITS TO FOREIGNERS However, U.S. banks have been the largest single external source of medium- and long-term funds for foreign industrial countries (except Canada) during the past 2 years. The increased outflow of term loans to Europe and to Japan after mid-1963 more than offset the decline in U.S. purchases of new foreign security issues. Almost every European country has been an important borrower of long-term U.S. bank funds. Italy alone has borrowed $340 million net since the beginning of 1963. In fact, it accounted for almost one-third of the total increase in outstanding credits to Europe. Norway, traditionally a heavy borrower to finance shipbuilding, has continued to draw substantially on U.S. bank credits, but in the past 2 years it has increased its long-term debt to U.S. banks less than has Austria, Belgium, Germany, or Sweden. Some countries that have stepped up their borrowing from U.S. banks—notably Italy and the Scandinavian countries—have also borrowed large amounts of foreign funds through new security offerings placed with investors in other European countries. Among developed countries outside Europe, Japan has been by far the heaviest borrower of long-term credits from U.S. banks; in the last 2 years it increased its debt by $260 million. At the same time it has been the largest borrower through external issues offered in Europe. But Australia too has borrowed sizable amounts from U.S. banks. Among less developed countries, Mexico has been a steady borrower in this country, both from banks and through bond issues. The Philippines, another country that has used long-term bank credit from the United States, recently has also sold bonds here. Some indication of the factors contributing to developed countries' demands for long-term funds may be obtained from data on commitments on long-term U.S. bank loans, classified according to purpose of loan, as shown in Chart 3. Although these reports apply only to loan commitments made during 1964, they are probably reasonably representative of the purposes of longterm loans utilized by foreign countries during 1963 and 1964. More than half of the commitments to borrowers in developed countries have been to provide for plant expansion or working capital or to refinance debt. For European countries the figure was just under half. Most credits to Europe and to other developed countries have been to private companies, including some affiliates of U.S. companies, rather than to governments or governmentrelated enterprises, as was customary in the case of foreign bond issues in the United States. European companies of prime credit standing are able to obtain short-term credits through banks in Europe, frequently through the Euro-dollar market, at rates that compare favorably with those 365 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 366 charged by U.S. banks. But the limited availability of mediumand long-term funds in European financial markets has created strong incentives for European companies to obtain long-term financing from U.S. banks to the maximum extent possible. By so doing they have been able to hold down the already high share of short-term financing in their total debt. These incentives were doubtless reinforced during 1963-64 by the policies of monetary restraint pursued by authorities in many European countries. U.S. BANKS' COMMITMENTS on long-term loans to developed countries in '64 were to finance a variety of transactions U.S. EXPORTS- THIRD-COUNTRY TRADE SHIPBUILDING OTHER NEW CAPITAL & REFINANCING DEVELOPED COUNTRIES NOTE.—U.S. Treasury data: developed countries, $1,150 million; Europe, $700 million. Only about 15 per cent of total long-term loan commitments to developed countries last year were made for the purpose of financing U.S. exports. Moreover, only 6 per cent of the commitments for loans to Europe were for this purpose. This was less than the total to Europe for financing trade among foreign countries. A somewhat higher proportion of commitments to less developed countries represented financing of U.S. exports. Some of these no doubt reflect credits extended under the guarantee and insurance programs of the Export-Import Bank. These programs have been designed to ensure adequate financing facilities for U.S. exports. U.S. supplies. In the past, term loans to foreigners have represented a very small part of total commercial and industrial term loans by U.S. banks. However, according to all available evidence, the amount of such loans outstanding has risen faster than the total during the past decade. And with the growth that began in early 1963, these loans have assumed still more importance in the BANK CREDITS TO FOREIGNERS total of term loans outstanding and in net extensions of credit to commercial and industrial businesses. For example, in the year to mid-1964, perhaps two-thirds of the increase in outstanding commercial and industrial term loans of New York City banks represented lending to foreigners. Banks active in the foreign field have customarily found foreign lending a means of developing customer relationships that could bring other foreign business to the bank. But the attractiveness to banks of foreign long-term loans in recent years may well lie at least as much in the immediate profitability of the credit as in the potential long-run advantages. Foreign term loans compare favorably with mortgages and municipal bonds as investment outlets for funds placed with banks on time deposit. Many foreign loans are made at interest rates of about 5Vi per cent for prime foreign borrowers, and the gross return to the bank may reach 6 per cent or more after allowance for the compensating balance maintained by the borrower. The relatively short maturity of these loans—averaging about 4 years, but generally with amortization payments over the last half of the period—makes them reasonably liquid. The rapid growth in term lending to foreigners has followed close behind the rapid growth in foreign time deposits in U.S. banks, principally those of foreign governments and central banks. Outstanding term loans to foreigners have increased by $1.5 billion and foreign official time deposits by about $1.75 billion since September 1962, just prior to the passage of legislation permitting U.S. banks to pay rates of interest on such deposits without regard to ceiling rates applicable to other deposits. Although there is no reason to presume that there is a close relationship between growth in foreign deposits and growth in foreign term loans for all banks, there doubtless is such a relationship for some banks. Moreover, the banks that have engaged most actively in making these term loans are among the largest and best known, and they are able to compete effectively with other U.S. banks in obtaining domestic funds through negotiable time certificates of deposit. Thus, the growth in foreign term lending of these banks has reflected efforts to find profitable investment outlets for domestic as well as foreign funds placed with them on time deposit, in much the same way that, beginning earlier, a much wider range of U.S. banks expanded their holdings of mortgages and municipal securities with the growth in their domestic time deposits. SHORT-TERM CREDITS At various times in recent years U.S. banks have extended large amounts of short-term loans and acceptance credits to foreigners. 367 368 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 The increase in the outflow of these credits to peak rates last year, approached only in late 1960 and in 1961, differs from the earlier build-up in that more banks throughout the country participated. Marked fluctuations in the outflow of short-term bank credit in recent years have reflected mainly variations in foreign demands for credits in an environment of a U.S. monetary policy that provided for moderate but steady growth in the reserve base. The availability of expanding reserves may have contributed to the spread of interest among U.S. banks in foreign lending, but during the past few years changes in the emphasis of monetary policy, toward firmer short-term interest rates and somewhat less ease in credit markets, have not been reflected in variations in short-term outflows of bank credits.

Until mid-1963, acceptance credits were not reported separately, and the figures are estimates. Latest figures, fourth quarter 1964. Most short-term U.S. bank credits have been to Japan and to less developed countries—countries where credit has regularly been in short supply and hence relatively expensive. Outflows of such credits to other industrial countries have been relatively small. Much of the trade among industrial countries is financed by suppliers on an open-book basis, and many of the short-term credit demands of European borrowers of prime standing are financed from European sources, including the Euro-dollar market. However, at times there have been some temporary outflows of U.S. bank funds to Europe, mainly through the banks' European branches, to meet midyear or end-of-year liquidity pressures. Moreover, some U.S. short-term nonbank funds have been supplied indirectly to European credit markets through deposits of BANK CREDITS TO FOREIGNERS 369 these funds in Canadian banks, as well as directly through deposits in Europe. And more generally, European countries have been able to increase their foreign exchange reserves through favorable payments balances with less developed countries more readily than would have been possible in the absence of the credit outflow from the United States to the latter countries. Heavy Japanese drawings on credits from U.S. banks have generally paralleled changes in economic activity in that country and in the level of its imports from the United States. At the same time Japan has used large amounts of Euro-dollar credits. In fact, a modest part of the U.S. short-term credit outflow to Japan last year represented funds initially obtained by Japanese banks in the Euro-dollar market and routed to Japan through offices of Japanese banks in the United States. Similarly, the increase in the outflow of short-term credits by U.S. banks to Latin America during 1964 accompanied improvement in economic conditions in some countries in that area and growth in their purchases from the United States. Some part of the expansion in credits to Latin America may have helped finance the increase in U.S. exports. LIMITING BANK LENDING ABROAD II w a s a g a i n s t t t l i s background of rapidly expanding short- and long-term credits to foreigners that the President's balance of payments program, as one of its major elements, called for the limitation of foreign lending by banks. An outline of the entire program appeared in the BULLETIN for February 1965, pages 256-57. Structural differences in credit and capital markets here and abroad, which are not fully reflected in prevailing differentials in interest rates, have contributed importantly to the strong foreign demands for U.S. bank credits. The major role of these foreign demands in the outflow last year—and in particular in the accelerated outflow in the second half, which occurred in the face of slightly firmer money and credit market conditions in the United States—emphasized the difficulty of attempting to bring about a substantial reduction in bank credit outflows through general U.S. monetary policy actions alone. The President's balance of payments message included three main elements relating to bank lending to foreigners: (1) imposition of the interest equalization tax (under the Gore amendment) on bank loans with maturities of 1 year or more, (2) a call on the Federal Reserve System—in cooperation with the Treasury—to work with all banks to limit lending to foreigners, and (3) legislation to provide immunity from antitrust laws for specific voluntarily agreed programs, if such programs are needed with respect to foreign loans by banks. FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 Imposition of the interest equalization tax on long-term bank loans raises the cost of such credits to foreign borrowers in developed countries by approximately 1 per cent per annum. The tax applies to all loan disbursements made after February 10, 1965, except loans for which firm commitments existed before August 5, 1964. The law makes exceptions for loans to finance U.S. exports and for all loans to less developed countries. The increased cost of long-term bank loans to foreign borrowers in developed countries tends to reduce the demand of these borrowers and eliminates their incentives to seek funds through long-term U.S. bank loans in preference to bond sales. In carrying out its responsibilities under the President's program, the Federal Reserve System has requested all banks to limit their credits to foreigners so that, in general, they will not exceed 105 per cent of the amount outstanding at the end of 1964. Within this guideline, the banks are expected to give absolute priority to bona fide export credits. With respect to nonexport credits, they are expected to give highest priority to loans to less developed countries, and to avoid policies that would place undue burdens on Canada, Japan, or the United Kingdom. The System's guidelines for banks are published on pages 37175 of this BULLETIN, and the guidelines for foreign lending by nonbank financial institutions on pages 375 and 376. The program envisages a sharp reduction in the outflow of bank credit in 1965, and this should provide substantial relief for the U.S. payments position. The total extension of bank credit to foreigners contemplated in the guidelines, while much lower than the extraordinary rate of last year, would nevertheless be a higher rate of outflow than occurred in 1962 and the first half of 1963. 370 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM Guidelines For Banks and Nonbank Financial Institutions On February 10,1965, the President sent to the Congress a message on the U.S. balance of payments in which he presented a program aimed at achieving quickly a substantial improvement in our balance of payments position. This program is of major importance since the balance of payments deficit is a serious national problem. A major responsibility in carrying out the President's program was placed on the Federal Reserve System and on the banking and financial community. The System has already taken the first measures in carrying out the program. On the day the President delivered his message, the Federal Reserve Banks issued a circular soliciting the cooperation of the commercial banks and outlining specific steps to be taken by the banks.1 On February 18, in Washington, Chairman Martin and Governor Robertson, who is coordinating the System's activities in this matter, discussed the request in detail with representatives of the banking and financial community, following a meeting of these representatives with the President. The Board of Governors has now issued guidelines to be followed by banks and by nonbank financial institutions in their foreign lending activities. The guidelines for each group are printed below. Guidelines for Banks The following guidelines, designed for use in implementing President Johnson's program for the voluntary curtailment of foreign credit by banks, will be in effect until modified or supplemented. However, they may be changed from time to time in the light of new circumstances and in the light of the experience gained as the program goes forward. The guidelines should be helpful to individual banks as they play their own particular part in the achievement of the President's over-all balance of payments program, and each bank should feel free ^ h e President's program and the statement issued by the Federal Reserve Banks were published in the BULLETIN for February 1965, pp. 256-57. at any time to discuss its problems with the Federal Reserve Bank of its district. It is clear that banks, in undertaking a voluntary role in the program, are being called upon to make sacrifices. In restraining the growth of their loans to foreigners they will be foregoing some of the gains that would otherwise have accrued to them. But, if a voluntary program is to be effective, decisions on future specific loan transactions must be made primarily with an eye to the national interest rather than profits. The achievement of the President's goal will be in the long-term interest not only of the nation, but also of the individual institutions 371 372 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 which are now being called upon to forego immediate advantage or gain. (1) Establish a target base for an individual bank The objective of the program is that outstanding bank credit to nonresidents of the United States not rise above the amount outstanding at the end of 1964 by more than 5 per cent, subject to the conditions set forth in guideline (3). The following steps are involved in calculating the base, and the amount of credit outstanding on any particular date, for an individual bank: 1. Take outstanding claims of U.S. banking offices on foreigners as of December 31, 1964, as required to be reported on Treasury Department foreign exchange forms B-2 and B-3. Contingent accounts, such as unused balances of letters of credit and commitments to lend, are excluded from the base. (For further information, reference is made to the instructions printed on forms B-2 and B-3.) 2. Subtract from this amount any claims for account of customers included on the forms, as well as any participations in individual loans arranged by the Export-Import Bank or made with ExportImport Bank guarantees. 3. Add any claims not reportable on forms B-2 and B-3, such as long-term foreign securities and permanent capital invested in foreign branches and subsidiaries. 4. Compensating balances, or any other claim on the lending bank of the debtor or of any other person by arrangement or understanding with the debtor, should not be deducted from loans or other claims on foreigners for purposes of determining the base. 5. It is expected that a simplified form for making the above calculations, and for making monthly reports on foreign credits, will be furnished to the banks within a short time. Banks that are exempted from reporting on the Treasury forms because their foreign credits are below the minimum reporting requirement are nevertheless included in the program. (2) Participations in Export-Import Bank loans and loans guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank Participations in individual export loans arranged by the Export-Import Bank, loans with Export-Import Bank guarantees or insurance, and holdings of \"Export-Import Portfolio Fund\" participations are excluded from the 5 per cent target. The role of the Export-Import Bank within the framework of the President's program will be coordinated by the National Advisory Council for International Monetary and Financial Problems. (3) Banks in excess of 5 per cent target It is clearly recognized that some banks may currently be above the 5 per cent target because of loans made prior to February 11, 1965, or may subsequently be brought above the target as a result of (a) binding commitments entered into before February 11, or (b) the extension of bona fide export credits, or (c) the extension of credits at the specific request of an agency of the U.S. Government. A bank in such circumstances would not be considered to be acting in a manner inconsistent with the program; however, it should reduce its claims on foreigners to 105 per cent of the base as quickly as possible. Even in the most extreme case, this GUIDELINES FOR BANKS reduction should be accomplished within the next 12 months. Such a bank will be invited periodically to discuss with the Federal Reserve Bank of its district the steps it has taken and proposes to take to bring about the reduction of its claims on foreigners consistent with these guidelines. Banks with bona fide commitments are clearly not being asked to refuse to honor such commitments, even if honoring them involves a temporary excess of lending above the target. However, banks would be expected to seize every opportunity to withdraw or reduce commitments, including credit lines, that are not of a firm nature, and to ensure that drawings under credit lines are kept to normal levels and usage. At time of renewal, all credit lines should be reviewed in light of their consistency with the voluntary foreign credit restraint program. Proposed extensions or renewals of existing bona fide commitments should be reviewed in the same manner. (4) Loan priorities Within the 5 per cent guideline, absolute priority should be given to bona fide export credits. Credits that substitute for cash sales or for sales customarily financed out of nonbank or foreign funds are not entitled to priority. With respect to nonexport credits, banks should give the highest priority to loans to less developed countries and should avoid restrictive policies that would place an undue burden on countries such as Canada and Japan, which are heavily dependent on U.S. financing, and on the United Kingdom, which is suffering from balance of payments difficulties. Given the probability of some expansion of the end-of-1964 volume of loans for fi- 373 nancing exports and the priorities established for the less developed countries, as well as the need to avoid restrictive practices with regard to Canada, Japan, and Britain, it is expected that nonexport credit to the other advanced countries will be cut back to the extent needed to achieve the goal of the President's program. Without attempting to specify all types of loans that will need to be restricted, it is obvious that credits to developed countries that can be cut back with benefit to our balance of payments and with the least adverse side-effects include: credits to finance third-country trade; credits to finance localcurrency expenditures outside the United States; credits to finance fixed or working capital needs; and all other nonexport credits to developed countries that do not suffer from balance of payments difficulties. (5) Bank sales of foreign assets to U.S. residents In general, banks should not expand their lending abroad by selling to U.S. residents (including U.S. banks) claims on foreigners existing as of the base date and replacing such assets with other loans to foreigners. Sales to U.S. residents of foreign securities owned on the base date, which would be free of the interest equalization tax, or of loan participations, could assist an individual bank to stay within the 5 per cent target, but would clearly not benefit the U.S. payments position. Therefore, in the event of any such sales the bank's base should be reduced by an amount equivalent thereto. (6) Banks with no foreign loans outstanding on December 31, 1964 In general, banks with no previous foreign lending experience would be expected not to make foreign loans during 1965. However, 374 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 bona fide export loans to foreigners may be made in reasonable amounts, provided this financing does not represent a shift from previous U.S. or foreign sources of financing.

Pension funds, including dents for purposes of the program. 375 GUIDELINES FOR BANKS (11) Problems of Edge Act Corporations Edge Act and Agreement Corporations are included in the voluntary credit restraint effort. The foreign loans and investments of such a corporation may be combined with those of the parent bank for the purposes of the program, or separate targets may be set for the parent bank and the subsidiary. An Edge Act Corporation that has not yet undertaken any significant volume of loans and investments may take as a base, alone and not in combination with its parent, its paid-in capital and surplus, up to $2.5 million, even though an equivalent amount of foreign loans and investments had not yet been made as of December 31, 1964. (12) U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks Branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States are requested to comply with the principles of the program of credit restraint applicable to domestic banks. (13) Substitution of export credit for credit for other purposes Banks should be on the alert to avoid granting credit to domestic customers if the result would be to aid the latter in making foreign loans or investments inconsistent with the program. Even export credit to foreigners, if it supplants credit previously obtained from foreign sources and thus frees the foreign funds for other uses, may be detri- mental to the U.S. payments position. This is obviously a difficult area and one in which there is considerable room for possible damaging substitution of domestic for foreign financing, and for substitution of export credits to foreigners for other credits to foreigners. In general, success will depend on the ability of banks to identify loans that are inconsistent with the program and on the application of the Department of Commerce program with respect to foreign credit and investment by nonfinancial firms. (14) Management of a bank's liquid funds Banks that have placed their own funds abroad for short-term investment purposes, including U.S. dollar deposits outside the United States or the acquisition of non-U.S. money market paper, should refrain from increasing such deposits and investments and should, in a reasonable and orderly manner, seek to reduce them. Since such funds are ordinarily placed outside the United States solely to provide a slightly higher rate of return, they are strong candidates for reduction under the program. This guideline applies equally to deposits and investments payable in foreign currencies and to those payable in U.S. dollars. This guideline does not call for a reduction in necessary working balances held with foreign correspondents, although such balances are also considered claims on nonresidents for the purposes of the program. Tentative Guidelines Nonbank Financial Institutions (1) Deposits and money-market instruments Holdings of liquid funds abroad should be limited to the 1964 year-end total, and the longer-term objective is to reduce such in- vestments in a gradual and orderly manner to the December 31, 1963, level. Included in this category of liquid investments are dollar-denominated deposits held in foreign 376 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks; short-term securities of foreign governments and their instrumentalities; foreign commercial paper, finance company credits and bankers' acceptances; and all other negotiable instruments maturing in 1 year or less. Foreign bank deposits denominated in local currencies may be maintained to the extent needed to support ordinary business operations in that country. (2) Foreign credits with original maturities of 5 years or less Holdings of investments other than those listed above, and written to have final maturities in 5 years or less, should not be increased by more than 5 per cent during calendar 1965. Included in this category are securities, mortgage and other loans, and credits of all other types. The 5 per cent growth ceiling is to be measured against the total of all such holdings at the end of 1964, without regard to type of instrument or country of origin. Priority should be given to credits that directly finance U.S. exports, however, and special care should be taken to avoid the extension of credit to borrowers who would have been accommodated by commercial banks in the absence of the voluntary restraint program. (3) Foreign credits with original maturities over 5 years In the area of long-term financing, there would seem to be no present need for a guideline under the voluntary restraint pro- gram. Developments in the long-term credit area will be followed closely, however, so that we may be alert to excessive foreign financing demands if they should materialize. The issues of industrialized countries are subject to the interest equalization tax, and have been very small in volume since that tax became effective. Borrowing by the less developed countries has been relatively light also, and in any event should not be substantially restricted in view of our national policy encouraging productive investment in these countries. In the case of Canada and Japan, separate agreements will serve to limit aggregate financing in United States capital markets. (4) Direct investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries Some types of financial institutions may conduct operations abroad through foreign offices, branches, and subsidiaries. In such cases, institutions are urged to limit their additional investment in these operations to the fullest extent practicable during 1965. Particular care should be taken to restrict any increase in net loans and advances outstanding to foreign branches and subsidiaries; ordinarily, expansion in such credit during 1965 should be held within 5 per cent. In the case of insurance carriers doing business abroad, these guidelines are not applicable to holdings of foreign investments in amounts up to 110 per cent of foreign policy reserves. Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations This sixth joint interim report reflects the Treasury-Federal Reserve policy of making available additional information on foreign exchange operations from time to time. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York acts as agent for both the Treasury and the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System in the conduct of foreign exchange operations. This report was prepared by Charles A. Coombs, Vice President in charge of the Foreign Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Special Manager, System Open Market Account, It covers the period September 1964-February 1965. Previous reports were published in the BULLETINS for September 1962 and for March and September 1963 and 1964. As noted in the previous report covering the period March-August 1964, the Federal Reserve had completely liquidated its outstanding swap drawings by the end of June, while drawings made by other central banks amounted to no more than $65 million. Such diminished use of international credit facilities reflected a reduced deficit in the U.S. balance of payments and a general narrowing of payments imbalances throughout the world. This general movement toward international payments equilibrium suffered a setback during the second half of 1964, however, mainly owing to the eruption of the sterling crisis, heavy outflows of U.S. bank credit and long-term investment, and the continuation and even further tightening of the credit squeeze in continental European markets. The risk of sudden, heavy strains upon the gold exchange system had been well anticipated by the central banks and treasuries of the major industrial countries, but the severity of the pressures developing in late 1964 required a further reinforce- ment of intergovernmental defenses against currency speculation. During the reporting period September 1964-February 1965, the Federal Reserve swap network was strengthened by increases in the swap arrangement with the National Bank of Belgium from $50 million to $100 million and in the arrangement with the Bank of England from $500 million to $750 million. The swap network now covers reciprocal credit lines totaling $2,350 million, as shown in Table 1 on page 389. The short-term credits extended to the Bank of England by the central banks of Europe, Canada, and Japan in November 1964 provided further impressive evidence of the solidarity of central bank defenses when confronted with a currency crisis. Also during the period, the authority of the International Monetary Fund to borrow from its member countries was invoked for the first time, and much progress was made toward the scheduled 25 per cent increase in IMF quotas during 1965. This process of challenge and timely response will no doubt con- 377 378 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 tinue to guide the further evolution of the international financial system. The sterling emergency necessitated sizable drawings by the Bank of England upon the Federal Reserve, which more or less concurrently drew heavily upon its swap lines with the continental European central banks in order to cushion the impact of heavy dollar inflows arising from both the British and U.S. deficits. Bank of England drawings on the Federal Reserve swap line rose to a peak of $700 million on November 27 but have subsequently been greatly reduced. To absorb part of the dollar flows to the continental European central banks, the Federal Reserve made drawings upon the swap lines with the central banks of Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy and with the Bank for International Settlements. Of these drawings, $380 million remained outstanding as of the end of February 1965. Further assisting the financing of both British and U.S. payments imbalances, the central banks and governments of other countries provided short- and medium-term financing through accumulations of dollars, extension of credits to the United Kingdom, purchases of U.S. Treasury foreign-currency securities, and provision of credit through the IMF. In addition to central bank swap operations, both the Treasury and Federal Reserve also engaged in forward operations in Netherlands guilders and Swiss francs in order to calm market fears and encourage an outward flow of short-term funds from Amsterdam and Zurich. The Swiss National Bank took steps to help cushion the effects of anticipated year-end pressures on the Swiss franc. The German Federal Bank also made available swap facilities to German commercial banks for investments in U.S. Treasury bills in order to reduce or offset temporary pressures on the exchange market resulting from short-term capital flows. Similarly, extensive use of forward operations was made by the Bank of England in December 1964 fo reassure the market and relieve pressure on the spot rate. The foreign currency bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury rose from $1,035 million outstanding on August 31, 1964, to $1,137 million as of early March 1965 as shown in Table 2 on page 389. Additional issues of $50 million were made to the German Federal Bank and $50 million to the Austrian National Bank to absorb surplus dollars on the books of these central banks. While these central bank and intergovernmental credit operations provided partial and temporary financing of the payments imbalances developing during the period, gold continued to play its traditional role. During the third and fourth quarters of 1964, sales of gold by the U.S. Treasury amounted to $442 million, against gold purchases of $338 million. The international financial system was thus confronted with a major challenge in late 1964 that was successfully countered. The unprecedented mobilization of $4 billion of international liquidity in defense of sterling was a striking illustration of the strength and flexibility of the central bank and IMF defenses against currency crises. Perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that the international defense of sterling was accomplished in the face of a serious deterioration in the balance of payments of the other major reserve currency center, the United States. Such a rallying of governmental and central bank support for the present system depended, however, upon one basic assumption: that both the British and the U.S. Governments would quickly put in motion force- FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS ful corrective programs to eliminate their payments deficits. These corrective programs are now under way and, if pursued with determination, will soon relieve the international financial mechanism of the enormous pressures generated by simultaneous deficits in the two major reserve currency countries. Under such conditions, the gold exchange standard, adapting as it has in the past to changing world conditions, can efficiently facilitate a continuing growth of world trade and payments. The successful response to the challenge of the sterling crisis has unfortunately been marred by the widespread and exaggerated publicity given to the French Government's call for a return to the gold standard and for the elimination of dollars and sterling from official reserves. This approach has found no support among central banks and treasuries of other countries. The main effect has been to stir up some previously dormant private speculation in the London gold market to the detriment of official acquisitions of newly mined gold. Sterling. Early in 1964 sterling showed weakening tendencies as a result of the deteriorating trade position of the United Kingdom, and various uncertainties connected with the general election to be called sometime during the year. A timely increase of the Bank of England discount rate from 4 to 5 per cent in late February temporarily relieved market pressures, while delay of the general election until October induced some short covering by commercial interests. Late in May, however, tight conditions in several continental money markets exerted new pressure on sterling. These pressures became strong toward the end of June because of heavier-than-usual midyear windowdressing by continental banks. To temper the impact of these movements of funds on 379 official reserves, the Bank of England on June 30 drew $15 million against its $500 million swap line with the Federal Reserve; it repaid the drawing on July 13. As the credit squeeze in the continental money market centers extended into July, moderate selling of sterling continued, and the spot rate moved downward with a minimum of official support to a low for the month of $2.7874 on July 20. The decline in the spot rate was taken in stride by the market without any speculative reaction developing. Indeed, market confidence in the sterling parity at that time was such that the discount on forward sterling tended to narrow as the spot rate declined. As the discount on forward sterling was reduced, the covered interest-arbitrage differential on Treasury bills in favor of London became correspondingly more attractive and by July 13 had reached 0.44 per cent per annum. To forestall private covered outflows in response to this arbitrage inducement, the Federal Reserve, with the agreement of the Bank of England, intervened in the market to reduce the arbitrage differential. This intervention, amounting to a total of $54 million equivalent in mid-July and again in late August, was accomplished by swap transactions in the New York market, with the Federal Reserve buying sterling spot and selling sterling forward against U.S. dollars. These operations had the dual effect of protecting the dollar against shortterm flows of funds from New York to London while at the same time lending useful support to the spot rate on sterling. In September, sterling came under increased pressure, owing mainly to increasingly widespread recognition of the mounting balance of payments deficit of the United Kingdom, which became further aggravated by the usual seasonal weakness during the 380 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 autumn and early winter months. Uncertainties connected with the general election called for October 15 further unsettled the sterling exchange market, and the problem of maintaining confidence in sterling seemed likely to become increasingly difficult. In anticipation of reserve losses, the Bank of England in mid-September made timely arrangements to supplement the $500 million swap line with the Federal Reserve by another $500 million of short-term credit facilities with other central banks in Europe and with the Bank of Canada. This reinforcement of the British reserve position cushioned the impact of recurrent, and increasingly forceful, waves of selling during September and October. Net drawings by the Bank of England on the Federal Reserve swap line and on short-term facilities provided by other central banks rose to $415 million by the end of October. The new Labor Government elected on October 15 was thus immediately confronted with a grave balance of payments situation. The announcement on October 26 of emergency surcharges of 15 per cent on a wide range of imports brought only brief relief as critical reactions appeared among Britain's trading partners world wide, more particularly the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) group. In a formal budget presented to parliament on November 11, the Government proposed certain new welfare benefits, to be financed by tax increases, and announced that it intended to introduce a capital gains tax and to substitute a new corporation tax for the existing application of the income tax to corporations. These proposals created uncertainty in business circles, in part because the immediate deflationary influence of the increased tax on fuel and of the import surcharge was to some extent obscured by the other measures. These uncertainties in domestic financial markets were in turn communicated to the exchange market. During this period the exchange market began to anticipate action on the discount rate on each successive Thursday, and thus a pattern developed of a strengthening of sterling prior to Thursday of each week, followed by a major selling wave on Friday as the discount rate remained unchanged. When the bank rate remained unchanged on Thursday, November 19, reserve losses by the Bank of England on the following day reached such proportions that action could no longer be postponed. On Monday, November 23, the Bank of England raised its discount rate from 5 to 7 per cent. Perversely enough, market reaction to such forceful use of monetary policy by the Labor Government quickly degenerated into fears that the threat to sterling must have reached a truly crisis stage. Whether these reactions might have been averted by earlier discount rate action, more particularly on the usual Thursday date for discount rate announcements, may be debated for some time to come. In any event, the market seized on rumors that the $1 billion of short-term central bank credits at the disposal of the Bank of England in September had now been exhausted; that the $1 billion standby credit from the IMF secured by the British Government in August had accordingly been fully committed to repayment of such central bank credits; and, hence, that the United Kingdom would have to fall back in defense of sterling upon its reserves of roughly $2 billion. (The still substantial unused drawing rights on the IMF would have required longer to mobilize than events at that time allowed.) This situation assumed increasingly grave FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS significance on the London afternoon—and the New York morning—of November 24 when a virtual avalanche of selling developed. If sterling were to be rescued, it was clear that a major package of international credit assistance would be required. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Federal Open Market Committee—meeting through a telephone conference—committed itself to an increase in the Federal Reserve-Bank of England swap line from $500 million to $750 million if credit assistance on a roughly corresponding scale could be secured from other central banks. That evening the Export-Import Bank gave assurance of a $250 million standby facility. Beginning early on the morning of November 25, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the central banks of other major countries were in almost continuous telephone communication. At 2 p.m., New York time, it was announced that a $3 billion credit package provided by 11 countries and the BIS was at the disposal of the Bank of England. As a result of the heavy reserve losses, not only were the $500 million Federal Reserve swap and the additional $500 million of other central bank credit facilities made available to the Bank of England in September fully exhausted, but also immediate drawings of $200 million on the new credit facilities were required. From the end-ofOctober figure of $415 million, recourse by the Bank of England to central bank credit facilities thus rose by $785 million during November to a total of $1.2 billion. Of this total, the Federal Reserve share was $675 million. In early December the British Government drew the full amount of its $1 billion standby facility with the IMF and so repaid an equivalent amount of the central bank 381 credits outstanding, including $500 million of the Federal Reserve credit. At the same time Switzerland, which, although not a member of the IMF, is associated with the General Arrangements to Borrow, provided the United Kingdom with a 3-year credit of $80 million; $50 million of the Swiss credit was used to repay an earlier loan from Switzerland, outstanding from the sterling crisis of 1961. With its exchange reserves thus heavily reinforced, the British Government could face with confidence further temporary pressures on sterling during December. Selling was particularly heavy just prior to the long Christmas week end, and during the month the Bank of England increased its use of short-term central bank credit facilities from the $200 million outstanding early in December to $525 million at the year-end. Of this $325 million increase, $25 million was secured by an increased use of the Federal Reserve swap line, raising the total outstanding from $175 million to $200 million, while $300 million was drawn from other central banks. Beginning in late November heavy selling of sterling appeared in the forward market, mainly by commercial interests insuring their future exchange transactions. This selling threatened to move the forward sterling rate to an excessive discount and hence intensify sales of sterling in the spot market. Accordingly, the Bank of England gave firm support to the forward rate. This support not only served to lessen the drain on reserves from spot transactions at the time, but more generally helped to buttress confidence in sterling by providing official reassurance that the sterling parity would be maintained. The operation was comparable to the determined stand taken in the forward market by other central banks in 382 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 recent years, and it promised to achieve the same useful results. After the turn of the year, both the spot and forward markets for sterling returned to a more balanced position. Since then, sterling has shown an increasingly buoyant trend. On February 10 it was announced that those of the central bank credit facilities made available last November which were shortly due to expire would be replaced by new facilities, available to the end of May, thus reconstituting the entire $3 billion credit package. By the end of February the Bank of England was able to start repaying its debts. In addition to direct swap transactions with the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also moved into the market at various times during the autumn months to purchase sterling for both System and Treasury account. These acquisitions were made on both an outright and a swap basis; the particular technique used was determined by market conditions at the time, in consultation with the Bank of England. Swiss franc. At the beginning of 1964, Federal Reserve swap drawings of Swiss francs under the swap lines of $150 million equivalent with both the Swiss National Bank and the BIS amounted to $220 million equivalent. By the end of June, these drawings had been completely liquidated through gold sales of $30 million to the Swiss National Bank, purchase from the Bank of Italy of the Swiss franc proceeds of a $100 million equivalent lira-Swiss franc swap, issuance by the U.S. Treasury of a $70 million equivalent Swiss franc bond to the BIS, and purchases of Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank. U.S. Treasury market commitments in forward Swiss francs were reduced during the course of the year from $121 million to $51.5 million. At the outset of 1964, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve also had outstanding a combined total of $53 million in swaps of third currencies into Swiss francs. These contracts had been reduced to $15 million by the end of February 1965. Despite the progress thus made in liquidating Treasury and Federal Reserve commitments in Swiss francs incurred in late 1963, new problems arose when sizable short-term funds—mainly repatriated Swiss assets—again flowed into Switzerland, both at midyear and particularly toward the close of the year as the pound sterling came under pressure. During the spring of 1964, interest rates in Switzerland continued to rise as the heavy demands imposed on the Swiss money and capital markets by the continuing high level of economic activity further squeezed the liquidity position of Swiss banks and firms. The interest rate on 3-month deposits reached 3.50 per cent in June, an increase of about 0.75 per cent per annum over the previous year, while the average yield on government bonds moved up to 4.05 per cent, compared with 3.15 per cent a year earlier. To relieve the squeeze on their liquidity positions, and to satisfy midyear window-dressing needs, the Swiss commercial banks made sizable repatriations of funds during June. These commercial bank operations caused the Swiss National Bank once again to take in substantial amounts of dollars. In July the reversing of some window-dressing operations and an easing of the Swiss money market brought about only a partial reversal of the previous inflows. In these circumstances the U.S. Treasury issued to the Swiss National Bank on August 4 an additional Swiss franc bond in the amount of FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS $52 million equivalent and used the proceeds to absorb an equivalent amount of dollars on the books of the Swiss National Bank. (This issue brought the outstanding amount of U.S. Treasury securities denominated in Swiss francs to $327 million equivalent.) Generally easier conditions prevailed in the market for Swiss francs from midAugust to mid-October, and the Swiss franc declined from its ceiling for a while, only to firm again in late October as the Swiss money market tightened. Then in the early part of November, funds began to move into Switzerland in quantity—some directly out of sterling, some through the Euro-currency markets in response to the general uneasiness that pervaded the exchanges. Throughout the rest of the year, sizable increases occurred in the dollar holdings of the Swiss National Bank. To absorb part of this intake of dollars, the Federal Reserve reactivated its $150 million swap with the BIS in early December by drawing $100 million of Swiss francs, which was simultaneously employed to purchase dollars from the Swiss National Bank. A further Swiss franc drawing of $60 million equivalent on the Swiss National Bank was made on January 19 for the same purpose. In addition, to calm the market and to encourage Swiss banks to invest abroad dollars that they might otherwise have sold to the Swiss National Bank, the Federal Reserve began in December to sell Swiss francs forward to the market through the Swiss National Bank. By January 8, 1965, such forward sales reached a peak of $32.5 million equivalent. Most of these contracts had been paid off by the end of February through spot purchases of Swiss francs. (The Swiss franc began to ease shortly after the year-end as Swiss banks, finding them- 383 selves liquid, started to place funds abroad.) During the second half of 1964 the dollar acquisitions of the Swiss National Bank were further reduced by purchases of $51 million of gold from the U.S. Treasury. Netherlands guilder. At the beginning of 1964 Federal Reserve commitments in guilders amounted to $80 million equivalent, all in the form of outstanding swap drawings. These were fully repaid by early April, as earlier inflows of funds into the Netherlands were reversed. In May the Netherlands money market began to tighten, and in early June the Netherlands Bank raised its discount rate from AtoAVi per cent. In July Netherlands commercial banks began to repatriate funds in substantial amounts. Moreover, the Netherlands balance of payments strengthened, owing to a better trade balance and an inflow of long-term capital. By November the intensified pressures on sterling and the ensuing movement of some funds out of sterling and into guilders helped push the guilder to its ceiling. Meanwhile, the Netherlands Bank had been taking in dollars in an effort to moderate the rise in the guilder rate. During the first week of August the Federal Reserve drew $20 million equivalent of guilders under the swap line and immediately used the guilders to absorb some of the Netherlands Bank's accruals of dollars. Further Federal Reserve drawings and sales of guilders followed in rapid sequence, and by mid-October the $100 million swap facility had been fully drawn. Additional dollars were purchased by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury from the Netherlands Bank in September and December with guilders acquired through 3-month swaps of sterling for guilders with the BIS, for a total of $50 million equivalent. As intensi- 384 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 fied buying pressures on the guilder developed in late December, a temporary swap arrangement for $35 million between the Netherlands Bank and the U.S. Treasury was agreed upon and fully employed. In mid-December recourse was also had to forward operations in Netherlands guilders for both Federal Reserve and Treasury account in order to provide reassurance to the market and induce covered capital outflows from the Netherlands. These operations, together with Netherlands provision of dollar credits to the Bank of England and purchases of gold from the U.S. Treasury, reduced the dollar holdings of the Netherlands Bank sufficiently to permit complete liquidation of the Treasury-Netherlands Bank $35 million swap by early January and repayment of $30 million of the Federal Reserve swap drawings in early February. As of the end of February, Federal Reserve drawings upon the swap line with the Netherlands Bank had thus been reduced to $70 million equivalent. During the second half of 1964, gold purchases by the Netherlands Bank from the U.S. Treasury amounted to $60 million. German mark. During 1963 and early 1964, there had been almost continuous upward pressure on the German mark. This pressure reflected a substantial increase in the German foreign trade surplus, large inflows of long-term capital, and occasional inflows of short-term funds in response to tight money market conditions or hedging operations. To ease the strain, the German Federal Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Treasury jointly conducted various spot and forward exchange operations, as outlined in previous reports in this series. On March 23, 1964, an important turning point occurred as the German Government announced its intention to propose to parliament the imposition of a 25 per cent withholding tax on income from German fixed-interest securities held by nonresidents. This action not only checked the long-term capital inflow, but also actually induced liquidation of a considerable volume of foreign investments in fixed-interest securities. Earlier surpluses on trade account also diminished as the year progressed, and this helped to restore a stable equilibrium in the exchange markets. The effect on the exchange market of these basic shifts in the German balance of payments was reinforced by a number of technical measures initiated by the German authorities to reduce temporary pressures on the exchange market resulting from shortterm capital flows. The special swap facilities made available by the German Federal Bank to German commercial banks for investments in U.S. Treasury bills were used flexibly throughout the second half of the year, with maturities providing the banks with liquidity at the year-end. In addition, under a special temporary arrangement in December, German commercial banks were permitted to borrow against collateral from the central bank at an effective cost lower than the posted rate. Nevertheless, the sterling crisis led to some inflow of funds to Germany in late December. Consequently, the Federal Reserve reactivated its $250 million swap facility with the German Federal Bank by drawing $50 million equivalent of marks in order to absorb $50 million of German dollar reserves. This drawing was reversed in late January 1965, as short-term outflows from Germany combined with German military purchases in the United States enabled the Federal Reserve to acquire $50 million of marks from the German Federal Bank. Another small drawing of $15 mil- FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS lion equivalent was made by the Federal Reserve on February 4 to help control any speculative tendencies resulting from President de Gaulle's press conference on the same date. During the 6-month period through February, the U.S. Treasury issued to the German Federal Bank in October 1964 a $50 million equivalent mark-denominated bond. This latest issue raised the total of such mark bonds outstanding to $679 million equivalent. The mark proceeds of this bond, together with $7 million of Treasury mark balances remaining from U.S. drawings of marks from the IMF, were sold to Canada to enable that country to make an IMF repayment. Subsequently, in early December when the U.S. Treasury drew $125 million equivalent of marks from the IMF, it used $50 million equivalent to purchase excess dollars from the German Federal Bank, in effect compensating for the fact that marks derived from the earlier bond issue had been used in conjunction with Canada's repayment to the IMF. Italian lira. Italy's balance of payments deficit had assumed major proportions in the fall of 1963, and the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury joined forces with the Bank of Italy in defense of the lira. As outlined in the previous report, Federal Reserve and Treasury operations in the autumn of 1963 and the first quarter of 1964 cushioned the decline in the Bank of Italy's reserves to the extent of some $350 million and thereby helped to restrain speculative pressures against the lira. During the week of March 9 through March 14, 1964, an Italian delegation headed by Governor Carli of the Bank of Italy visited Washington to discuss with the World Bank and the IMF various possible sources of financing for Italy's longer-term 385 investment requirements and its expected further balance of payments deficits. In the midst of these discussions, the lira was suddenly struck by a burst of speculation. This brought heavy pressures not only on the spot rate but also on the forward rate, which for a 3-month maturity moved to a discount of 7 per cent per annum. In this dangerous situation, an immediate and massive reinforcement of the Italian reserve position was clearly called for. Within 48 hours the Italian authorities were able to announce that they had arranged for approximately $1 billion of external assistance provided by the United States, the Bank of England, and the German Federal Bank. One of the most satisfactory aspects of this display of international cooperation in beating back a speculative attack on the Italian lira was that the provision of massive credit assistance to Italy more or less coincided with a turning point in the Italian economic and financial scene. During the first quarter of 1964 the Italian balance of payments had registered a deficit of $436 million. A surplus of $226 million was recorded in the second quarter, as corrective policy measures initiated by the Italian authorities began to take effect and as a reversal in the leads and lags in payments brought about the covering of short positions in lire. In early July, a governmental crisis generated a temporary speculative flurry, but operations in force in the forward market by the Bank of Italy through the agency of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provided reassurance and the speculation quickly subsided. Italy continued to run a payments surplus during the third and fourth quarters of 1964, and by the year-end Italian official reserves, which had dipped $233 million during the first quarter, were $389 million higher than 386 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 at the outset of 1964. The reappearance of political uncertainties in the late summer triggered some selling of forward lire, and discounts for 3-month maturities tended to widen at times to 4 per cent per annum. In such instances, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York again intervened for account of the Bank of Italy to support the forward lira in the New York market and thus helped to relieve market uncertainties. By early October the discount on the 3-month forward lira had narrowed to less than 1 per cent per annum. Continuing heavy flows of dollars to Italy in the closing months of 1964 and early 1965 may have partially reflected the sterling crisis. To absorb part of these dollar inflows, the Federal Reserve on January 22 reactivated its $250 million swap arrangement with the Bank of Italy by drawing $50 million equivalent of lire. Canadian dollar. The spot market for Canadian dollars was relatively quiet through the first half of 1964, but there was considerable activity in the forward market as a result of grain sales to the Soviet Union beginning in the previous autumn. These sales generated heavy demands on the part of grain dealers for Canadian dollars for future delivery against U.S. dollars. In order to offset some of these pressures, the Bank of Canada sold U.S. dollars spot and purchased them forward, thus providing some counterpart to the commercial banks' swap needs, while the Federal Reserve also intervened on a small scale. By the end of July, Canadian grain shipments to the Soviet Union had been fairly well completed, and pressures on the forward market eased. In August, heightening tensions in Vietnam generated some buying of spot Canadian dollars by continental interests, and as the spot rate rose in a thin market, Cana- dian exporters began to sell out U.S. dollar balances. New grain purchases by several eastern European countries exerted further upward pressure on the spot rate. At about the same time there was a tightening of the Canadian money market, which induced a temporary flow of short-term funds into Canada from the United States on a covered basis. Substantial Canadian long-term borrowings in the U.S. market, the sterling crisis, and fiscal-year-end positioning by Canadian banks in October and November pushed the spot rate for the Canadian dollar to its effective ceiling by November. As the Canadian dollar strengthened, the Bank of Canada intervened to moderate the rise in the rate, with the result that Canadian reserves increased by $210 million during the August-November period despite repayments of $107 million to the IMF in September and October. By December the market had returned to a more balanced position. In early February the Canadian dollar softened, as press discussion of prospective U.S. balance of payments measures led to some apprehension in the markets that Canada might be unfavorably affected. The U.S. balance of payments program, announced on February 10, made it clear that there was no U.S. intention to deprive the Canadian economy of essential inflows of capital. Nevertheless, the Canadian dollar weakened somewhat further in the second half of the month—reportedly reflecting Canadian commercial buying of U.S. dollars and unfavorable seasonal factors. Belgian franc. Early in July 1964 the Belgian franc strengthened, following the announcement of new measures designed to curb the growth of credit in Belgium. On July 3 the National Bank of Belgium raised its discount rate by V2 percentage point to FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS 4% per cent and announced that, effective August 17, it would impose a cash reserve requirement against commercial bank deposits for the first time. Tighter money market conditions developed and—in conjunction with long-term investment in Belgium, an improved trade balance beginning in the third quarter and the sterling crisis later in the year—contributed to substantial dollar inflows into Belgium. Early in August the Federal Reserve used $7.5 million equivalent of Belgian francs drawn under the $50 million swap arrangement to absorb dollars on the books of the National Bank of Belgium. By mid-October the entire $50 million equivalent of franc balances had been so utilized. Effective October 22 the Federal Reserve and the National Bank of Belgium expanded the existing $50 million swap facility with an additional $50 million arrangement to be available on a standby basis. As dollars continued to flow into Belgium, the Federal Reserve made further drawings on this additional swap and by the end of November had used the full amount. The Federal Reserve was able to reduce its swap commitments to Belgium to $25 million equivalent in early December, when the National Bank of Belgium purchased $75 million from the Federal Reserve to make special outpayments. On December 30, however, the Federal Reserve again drew $20 million equivalent of francs in order to absorb further inflows of dollars into Belgium, and further utilization of $40 million equivalent under the swap arrangement became necessary in January and February 1965. As of the end of February, total Federal Reserve use of the $100 million swap arrangement with the National Bank of Belgium amounted to $85 million equivalent. Meanwhile, during the second half of 1964, 387 the National Bank of Belgium had purchased $40 million of gold from the United States. Japanese yen. On April 30 the Bank of Japan drew $50 million under the $150 million swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve in order to cushion a decline in Japanese reserves. This drawing was renewed on July 30, as reserve pressures continued, and a further drawing of $30 million was made on July 31. In August, however, domestic restraint measures began to take effect: import demand diminished and, with a continued growth in exports, the trade balance improved considerably. With this improvement in Japan's balance of payments and reserve position, the Bank of Japan began repaying its swap obligations at the end of September, and by early November it had liquidated them in full. Austrian schilling. There were no System operations in Austrian schillings during the period. Although the Austrian balance of payments registered a considerable deficit in the last quarter of 1964, the figures for 1964 as a whole continued to show a surplus. Therefore, on February 23 and March 3, 1965, the Treasury issued to the Austrian National Bank two $25 million equivalent 18-month bonds denominated in Austrian schillings, using the proceeds to absorb some of that bank's dollar holdings. These issues brought the outstanding total of U.S. Treasury bonds denominated in Austrian schillings to $100 million equivalent. Swedish krona and French franc. There were no Federal Reserve or Treasury operations in Swedish kronor or French francs during the period under review. U.S. drawing on the international monetary fund. Over the course of several years before 1964, foreign countries had been repaying more dollars to the IMF than the IMF had 388 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 been paying out in new drawings. As a result, the IMF's dollar holdings rose to a point where they equaled the amount that the United States had paid into the IMF as part of its quota. At this point the IMF, under its rules, could no longer accept dollars in repurchase, and countries having repurchase obligations could make repayments only with gold or with other eligible convertible currencies. So as to be able to sell such currencies to countries having repurchase obligations, the U.S. Treasury on February 13 and June 1, 1964, made two drawings on the IMF—predominantly in German marks and French francs—in the amount of $125 million equivalent each under the $500 million standby agreement with the IMF announced by President Kennedy in July 1963. By September 1, the bulk of these currencies had been sold to various countries effecting repayments to the IMF. On July 23, 1964, the original standby arrangement expired, and the Treasury announced that it had made a further standby arrangement with the IMF for another year. This restored the amount available to $500 million. The first drawing under the new standby arrangement was made on September 1, when the United States drew $50 million in five European currencies. Unlike the first two drawings under the original arrangement, which were used to cover a number of transactions that took place during ensuing weeks, this drawing was occasioned by Italy's repurchase of $65 million equivalent of lire from the IMF. Again, on September 30, the U.S. Treasury drew equal amounts of Dutch guilders and German marks totaling $100 million equivalent, half of which was immediately sold to Canada in connection with a repayment to the IMF. The remaining balances were disbursed in subsequent weeks. On December 7 a third drawing of $125 million equivalent was made, this time solely in German marks. Since this program was initiated, the U.S. Treasury has drawn $525 million equivalent in seven continental European currencies, of which some $15 million equivalent remained undisbursed as of the end of February 1965. The effect of these drawings on the U.S. position in the IMF has been offset to a considerable extent, however, by drawings of dollars by other countries. The largest single dollar drawing was $200 million, under the $1 billion equivalent multicurrency drawing in December by the United Kingdom. As a result the U.S. repayment obligation to the IMF as of the end of February 1965 had been reduced to $256 million. The gold market and U.S. gold transactions. Throughout the first 8 months of 1964 the London gold market was generally stable, with the gold-fixing price ranging between $35.06 and $35.10. With the improvement in the U.S. balance of payments, and consequent strengthening of confidence in the dollar, speculative demand for gold receded, and as new production increased, the Gold Pool regularly absorbed surpluses of output reaching the market. The Pool took in further sizable amounts of gold from Russian sales, which were concentrated over a few weeks' span in late March and early April. Over the closing months of 1964, various political and financial disturbances tended to rekindle speculative buying of gold. International tensions arising out of the Vietnam conflict continued to generate market apprehension. But renewed speculation in the gold market was also attributable to the increasing pressures on sterling during the latter part of the year. In addition, the sharp deterioration in the U.S. balance of payments during the closing 389 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS months of 1964 contributed to market uncertainties, especially after the turn of the year. In February, various pronouncements emanating from Paris further stimulated speculative buying of gold by private interests. Both the United Kingdom and the United States have now taken forceful action to deal with their balance of payments deficits, and if these corrective programs are vigorously pursued, speculative pressures in the gold market may be expected to subside. The Bank of England, on behalf of the Gold Pool, continued to exert a stabilizing influence on the market and to moderate price movements. Although private demand for gold increased during the closing months of 1964, over the year as a whole the Pool once again acquired and distributed to its members more than $600 million. During the fourth quarter of 1964, continental central banks took in sizable amounts of dollars, and several sold part of their acquisitions to the U.S. Treasury for gold. These conversions, as well as the continued French purchases of gold each month, more than offset U.S. acquisitions from other sources. As a result, the United States became a net seller of gold in its international monetary transactions after having been a net purchaser earlier in the year (see Table 3). For 1964 as a whole, taking into account sales of about $89 million to domestic users, total U.S. gold holdings—including Stabilization Fund holdings as well as the Treasury gold stock—declined by $125 million. During the first 2 months of 1965, the Treasury gold stock declined by an additional $450 million.

The new series, which begins with January 1964 data, appears in this issue of the BULLETIN on page 440. This revision, the first major change in the series since March 1953, incorporates three innovations designed to make the series a more useful indicator of current economic and financial developments: 1. The geographic coverage for most reporting centers has been increased from the city to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). 1 2. Figures for the revised series reflect estimated universe totals for the SMSA's rather than reported figures only. 3. Monthly debits and deposit turnover for the national aggregate series are being published on an annual rate basis adjusted for seasonal variations and differences in calendar composition of days of the week in each month. Expansion of reporting to the SMSA basis has increased the deposit coverage of the series by 19 per cent and debits coverage by about 12 per cent on a national basis. Most of this increase results from the expansion of geographic coverage, but the conversion to estimated universe totals also accounts for 1 Geographical limits for individual SMSA's are those defined by the Budget Bureau (along county lines except in New England). NOTE.—This article was prepared by Lowell M. Glenn and Theodore Vander Noot of the Financial Statistics Section of the Board's Division of Data Processing. part of the increase. Demand deposits in the series continue to include commercial bank demand deposits of individuals, partnerships, and corporations, and of States and political subdivisions, and to exclude U.S. Government, interbank, and all time deposit accounts. As before, the series reflects debits arising from checks drawn on these accounts as well as from other charges against such accounts, that is, for U.S. Government security purchases, utility payments, service charges, and loan payments that are made directly from these accounts. SMSA REPORTING BASIS In the past few years the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area has become increasingly important as a geographical unit for statistical measurement. The SMSA is a more meaningful area for analyzing both debits and turnover because the cities represented in the old series frequently reflected arbitrary legal boundaries having little relationship to the economic structure of the urban areas. For these reasons, and in order to correlate the debits and deposit turnover series with other economic indicators that are available on the SMSA basis, this series has been converted to that basis. The number of reporting areas has been reduced to 225 from the 344 formerly covered.2 This reduction results from the combining of cities into larger Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the elimination 2 Seventeen cities or counties that are not SMSA's are included among the 225 reporting centers for purposes of regional coverage or because SMSA designation is likely in the future. 390 REVISION OF BANK DEBITS AND DEPOSIT TURNOVER SERIES of a number of smaller reporting centers that are not SMSA's. The current number of 225 centers will be maintained for at least a year. After that, additional areas may be included periodically as new SMSA's are designated or as data for older ones become available. Figures for the new series reflect estimated totals for all commercial banks in the SMSA rather than totals for reporting banks only as did the former series.3 Reporting banks hold, in the aggregate, 91 per cent of the deposits of all banks in the SMSA's covered in the series. The proportions of the deposits covered for individual Federal Reserve districts vary from a low of 88 per cent to nearly complete coverage. No SMSA or center having less than 70 per cent reporting coverage has been included. No attempt has been made to estimate an historical series on a SMSA basis because of problems of estimating data for the added suburban banks, which may have characteristics different from \"core\" city banks. The resulting discontinuity in the debits series limits its usefulness for long-term analyses, but it cannot be avoided. In any event, debits data are generally recognized to be more useful as a short-term economic indicator. SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES Different methods are used to compute seasonally adjusted data for debits and for turnover. Debits. In the revised debits series, separate seasonal adjustment factors are computed for each of the 225 areas. Seasonally adjusted debits for each grouping of centers (that is, 6 leading, 218 other, and so forth) are aggregates of the data for each of the component areas after seasonal adjustment. 3 A variety of local conditions affect each area, and the technique for expanding the reporting sample data to universe area levels for all commercial banks was determined on an individual basis by the Federal Reserve Banks. 391 An annual rate is obtained by multiplying the seasonally adjusted monthly figures by twelve. In the previous series, no adjustment was made for seasonal influences at individual centers; only groups of centers were adjusted. For the new series, in the absence of historical data from the individual SMSA's, it was necessary to compute seasonal adjustment factors for each central city, based on data from the previous series, and to assume that the same factors could apply to the corresponding SMSA's. Calculation of individual seasonal adjustment factors for each reporting area takes into account the diverse seasonal influences on debits activity in various sections of the country and in individual SMSA's. Seasonal variations arise from differences in crop marketings, production peaks and valleys, some tax payments, and similar seasonal influences that may differ from one part of the country to another. In addition, month-to-month variations in debits stem from two other sources. One is the length of the month—28, 29, 30, or 31 days. The other is the calendar or day-ofthe-week composition of the month—the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, and so forth. The first of these sources of variation has generally been part of any seasonal adjustment procedure, but it has been necessary to estimate calendar-composition differences by the use of such arbitrary devices as \"business days.\" A new seasonal adjustment computer program prepared by the Census Bureau takes into account in a single operation both sources of variation.4 4 Allen Young, \"Census Trading Day Adjustment Method,\" Bureau of the Census, Technical Papers and Background Materials. This paper is available from the Chief Economic Statistician, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20244. It is expected that specifications for the X-ll version of the Census Bureau's method II program for seasonal adjustment will be available from the same source. 392 FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN • MARCH 1965 Whether these seasonal patterns will be influenced by the addition of data for suburban areas can be answered only after observation of data covering a longer period. In any event, seasonal factors will be subject to revision following yearly re-evaluation of the SMSA debits data. Neither unadjusted monthly debits nor the seasonal adjustment factors for the national series will be released at this time. Turnover. The revised turnover rates have been derived from aggregate data for the groups of centers for which turnover rates are shown. In deriving the seasonally adjusted rates for each group of centers, the monthly universe estimates for total unadjusted debits of the component SMSA's were first adjusted for the calendar and workingday structure of the individual month, by use of the Census Bureau's X-l 1 trading-day adjustment procedure, and then converted to annual rates. The resulting debits, after allowance for trading days, were then divided by the universe estimates of demand deposits for the component SMSA's, that is, by the average of deposits for the current monthend and the previous month-end. Finally, the resulting turnover rate was adjusted for seasonal variation by use of the Census Bureau's X-9 procedure. STATISTICAL EFFECTS OF THE REVISION Table 1 compares the revised debits totals with the old debits totals on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis. The new series shows a level 11.6 per cent higher than the old series.
