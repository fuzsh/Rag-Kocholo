Digital 2022 report on Nicaragua in the “full report” section below, but let’s start by taking a look at the essential headlines for digital adoption and use in Nicaragua this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNicaragua’s population in 2022\n\nNicaragua’s total population was 6.74 million in January 2022.\n\nData show that Nicaragua’s population increased by 77 thousand (+1.2 percent) between 2021 and 2022.\n\n50.7 percent of Nicaragua’s population is female, while 49.3 percent of the population is male.\n\nAt the start of 2022, 59.6 percent of Nicaragua’s population lived in urban centres, while 40.4 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nNicaragua’s population by age\n\nThe median age of the population in Nicaragua is 27.2.\n\nFor additional context, here’s a look at how the population in Nicaragua breaks down by age group:\n\n9.5 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 0 and 4.\n\n15.4 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 5 and 12.\n\n9.2 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\n12.1 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\n16.8 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\n14.4 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\n9.8 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 45 and 54.\n\n6.7 percent of Nicaragua’s population is between the ages of 55 and 64.\n\n6.1 percent of Nicaragua’s population is aged 65 and above.\n\nNote: percentages may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInternet use in Nicaragua in 2022\n\nThere were 2.98 million internet users in Nicaragua in January 2022.\n\nNicaragua’s internet penetration rate stood at 44.2 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.\n\nKepios analysis indicates that internet users in Nicaragua increased by 238 thousand (+8.7 percent) between 2021 and 2022.\n\nFor perspective, these user figures reveal that 3.76 million people in Nicaragua did not use the internet at the start of 2022, meaning that 55.8 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, issues relating to COVID-19 continue to impact research into internet adoption, so actual internet user figures may be higher than these published numbers suggest (see here for further details).\n\nFor the latest insights into internet adoption and use around the world, follow our regular Global Statshot reports.\n\nGo global: see how Nicaragua’s current “state of digital” compares with connectivity in other countries by reading our flagship Digital 2022 Global Overview Report, which includes hundreds of slides of global digital data, and our in-depth analysis of what these numbers might mean for you.\n\nInternet connection speeds in Nicaragua in 2022\n\nData published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Nicaragua could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2022:\n\nMedian mobile internet connection speed via cellular networks: 15.51 Mbps.\n\nMedian fixed internet connection speed: 26.60 Mbps.\n\nOokla’s data reveals that the median mobile internet connection speed in Nicaragua increased by 3.05 Mbps (+24.5 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Ookla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Nicaragua increased by 14.03 Mbps (+112 percent) during the same period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSocial media statistics for Nicaragua in 2022\n\nThere were 3.80 million social media users in Nicaragua in January 2022.\n\nThe number of social media users in Nicaragua at the start of 2022 was equivalent to 56.4 percent of the total population, but it’s important to note that social media users may not represent unique individuals (see our detailed notes on data to learn why).\n\nKepios analysis reveals that social media users in Nicaragua increased by 300 thousand (+8.6 percent) between 2021 and 2022.\n\nGet fresh insights: our handy social media overview page helps you stay up to date with social media trends, offering essential headlines for social media adoption, as well as the latest user figures for the world’s most widely used social media platforms.\n\nFacebook users in Nicaragua in 2022\n\nData published in Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 3.45 million users in Nicaragua in early 2022.\n\nHowever, Meta made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data at the end of 2021 – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here are not directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.\n\nThe company’s revised audience figures mean that Facebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 51.2 percent of the total population at the start of 2022.\n\nHowever, Facebook restricts the use of its platform to people aged 13 and above, so it’s also worth highlighting that 68.2 percent of the “eligible” audience in Nicaragua uses Facebook in 2022.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 116 percent* of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2022.\n\nAt the start of 2022, 49.3 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Nicaragua was female, while 50.7 percent was male.\n\nNote: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\n*Advisory: we’re aware that usage rates in excess of 100 percent of the population, “eligible” population, and / or internet users may seem implausible, but we’ve elected to republish source data “as is”, to enable readers to make their own judgments. Please see our detailed notes on data to learn more about these anomalies.\n\nLooking for more Facebook stats?
