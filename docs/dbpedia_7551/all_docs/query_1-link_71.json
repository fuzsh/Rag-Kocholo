        "text": "This page contains all the latest data, insights, and trends you need to help you understand how people in Nicaragua use digital devices and services in 2023.\n\nIf you want to check whether this is our most up-to-date report on Nicaragua, or if you’re looking for data on digital trends and behaviours in Nicaragua for previous years, you can find our full collection of reports on Nicaragua by clicking here.\n\nYou’ll also find the complete Digital 2023 report on Nicaragua in the “full report” section below, but let’s start by taking a look at the key numbers for Nicaragua this year.\n\nThe state of digital in Nicaragua in 2023\n\nHere are the essential headlines for digital adoption and use in Nicaragua in early 2023:\n\nThere were 4.00 million internet users in Nicaragua at the start of 2023, when internet penetration stood at 57.1 percent.\n\nNicaragua was home to 3.45 million social media users in January 2023, equating to 49.3 percent of the total population.\n\nA total of 8.43 million cellular mobile connections were active in Nicaragua in early 2023, with this figure equivalent to 120.5 percent of the total population.\n\nThese headline stats offer a great overview of the “state of digital” in Nicaragua, but in order to make sense of how digital trends and behaviours are evolving, we need to dig deeper into the data.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what the latest numbers tell us, starting with some valuable context relating to Nicaragua’s population.\n\nNicaragua’s population in 2023\n\nNicaragua’s total population was 7.00 million in January 2023.\n\nData shows that Nicaragua’s population increased by 99 thousand (+1.4 percent) between 2022 and 2023.\n\n50.7 percent of Nicaragua’s population is female, while 49.3 percent of the population is male.\n\nAt the start of 2023, 59.7 percent of Nicaragua’s population lived in urban centres, while 40.3 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nNicaragua’s population by age\n\nThe median age of Nicaragua’s population is 25.2.\n\nHere’s how Nicaragua’s total population breaks down by age group:\n\n9.9 percent is between the ages of 0 and 4.\n\n15.8 percent is between the ages of 5 and 12.\n\n9.4 percent is between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\n12.9 percent is between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\n17.4 percent is between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\n13.4 percent is between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\n9.7 percent is between the ages of 45 and 54.\n\n6.1 percent is between the ages of 55 and 64.\n\n5.4 percent is aged 65 and above.\n\nNote: percentages may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\nInternet use in Nicaragua in 2023\n\nThere were 4.00 million internet users in Nicaragua in January 2023.\n\nNicaragua’s internet penetration rate stood at 57.1 percent of the total population at the start of 2023.\n\nKepios analysis indicates that internet users in Nicaragua increased by 56 thousand (+1.4 percent) between 2022 and 2023.\n\nFor perspective, these user figures reveal that 3.00 million people in Nicaragua did not use the internet at the start of 2023, suggesting that 42.9 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, complexities associated with the collection and analysis of internet user data mean that it can often take several months before research is ready for publication. As a result, the latest published figures for internet use invariably under-represent reality, and actual adoption and growth may be higher than the figures shown here suggest. Please see our comprehensive notes on data for further details.\n\nDig deeper: for the latest insights into internet adoption and use around the world, follow our regular Global Statshot reports.\n\nGo global: see how Nicaragua’s current “state of digital” compares with connectivity in other countries by reading our flagship Digital 2023 Global Overview Report, which includes hundreds of slides of global digital data, and our in-depth analysis of what these numbers might mean for you.\n\nInternet connection speeds in Nicaragua in 2023\n\nData published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Nicaragua could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2023:\n\nMedian mobile internet connection speed via cellular networks: 18.37 Mbps.\n\nMedian fixed internet connection speed: 41.41 Mbps.\n\nOokla’s data reveals that the median mobile internet connection speed in Nicaragua increased by 2.89 Mbps (+18.7 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Ookla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Nicaragua increased by 14.81 Mbps (+55.7 percent) during the same period.\n\nSocial media statistics for Nicaragua in 2023\n\nThere were 3.45 million social media users in Nicaragua in January 2023.\n\nThis figure might seem quite different to the values that we published in previous years, but please note that the sources we use to inform and calculate our social media user numbers have made important and wide-ranging revisions to their data over recent months.\n\nThese adjustments to source data mean that our latest numbers are not comparable with equivalent figures that we published in previous years, and readers should not regard any differences in these numbers as an actual change in social media use.\n\nIndeed, our analysis of various data points from trusted third parties such as GWI and data.ai shows that there has been no discernible drop in overall social media use, and in almost all countries, social media use continues to increase.\n\nAs a result, readers should view any such differences as “corrections” in the data, and not as an indication that social media adoption has declined.\n\nThe number of social media users in Nicaragua at the start of 2023 was equivalent to 49.3 percent of the total population, but it’s also important to note that social media users may not represent unique individuals (see our detailed notes on data to learn why).\n\nMeanwhile, data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 3.05 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Nicaragua at the start of 2023, which was equivalent to 67.2 percent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.\n\nMore broadly, 86.3 percent of Nicaragua’s total internet user base (regardless of age) used at least one social media platform in January 2023.\n\nAt that time, 50.7 percent of Nicaragua’s social media users were female, while 49.3 percent were male.\n\nNote: due to significant revisions in source data, we regret that we’re currently unable to provide reliable figures for the year-on-year change in social media users in Nicaragua. We recommend that readers do not compare our latest figures for social media use with figures published in our previous reports, because such comparisons will deliver inaccurate results.\n\nGet fresh insights: our handy social media overview page helps you stay up to date with social media trends, offering essential headlines for social media adoption, as well as the latest user figures for the world’s most widely used social media platforms.\n\nFacebook users in Nicaragua in 2023\n\nData published in Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 3.25 million users in Nicaragua in early 2023.\n\nHowever, Meta has made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data over recent months – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here may not be directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.\n\nFacebook user growth in Nicaragua\n\nFigures published in Meta’s own tools indicate that Facebook’s potential ad reach in Nicaragua decreased by 200 thousand (-5.8 percent) between 2022 and 2023.\n\nFor more recent context, the same data show that the number of users that marketers could reach with ads on Facebook in Nicaragua decreased by 250 thousand (-7.1 percent) between October 2022 and January 2023.\n\nHowever, it’s important to stress that these advertising reach figures are not the same as the monthly active users figures that Meta reports in its investor earnings announcements, and they should not be interpreted as such.\n\nAs the company states within its ad planning tools,\n\n“Estimated audience size is not a proxy for monthly or daily active users, or for engagement. Estimates aren’t designed to match population, census estimates or other sources, and may differ depending on factors such as how many accounts across Meta technologies a person has, how many temporary visitors are in a particular geographic location at a given time, and Meta user-reported demographics.”\n\nAs a result, changes in ad reach may not necessarily indicate any change in the platform’s overall user base.\n\nBut despite these caveats, Meta’s ad reach data still offers valuable insights into how Facebook use is evolving.\n\nFacebook adoption in Nicaragua\n\nFacebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 46.4 percent of the total population at the start of 2023.\n\nHowever, Facebook restricts the use of its platform to people aged 13 and above, so it’s worth highlighting that 62.5 percent of the “eligible” audience in Nicaragua uses Facebook in 2023.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Nicaragua was equivalent to 81.3 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2023.\n\nAt the start of 2023, 50.0 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Nicaragua was female, while 50.0 percent was male.\n\nNote: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\n▶ Looking for more Facebook stats?
