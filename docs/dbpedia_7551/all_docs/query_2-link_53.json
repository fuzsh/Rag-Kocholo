        "text": "MIRPS in Costa Rica\n\nCosta Rica has a long tradition of providing asylum and protection to refugees and asylum seekers. However, its national asylum system is under pressure because of displacement situations in the region, particularly cross border movements from Nicaragua. The country hosts approximately 102,335 persons in need of international protection, this figure represents 2% of Costa Rica total population. Of those, 92,209 are asylum seekers (mostly Nicaraguans â€“ 79,286) and 9,927 are refugees. To address the situation, Costa Rica has been part of the MIRPS since 2017 and has made progress in the implementation of its national commitments in support of protection and solutions for the forcibly displaced. At the same time, support from the international community in the areas of protection, jobs and livelihoods and social protection will be needed to address the needs of the thousands of people seeking safety in the country."
