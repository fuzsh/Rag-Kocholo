        "text": "Plant and animal life\n\ninNicaragua inLand\n\nAlthough Nicaragua’s forests suffer from poorly regulated commercial exploitation and the increasing human footprint of the country’s burgeoning population, they are still the largest in Central America. Covering more than one-third of the country, they vary considerably in terms of elevation and rainfall. Nicaragua’s forests contain valuable cedar, mahogany, and pine timber as well as quebracho (axbreaker), guaiacum (a type of ironwood), guapinol (which yields resin), and medlar (which produces a crab-apple-like fruit).\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Nicaragua\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Daniel Ortega\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 6,875,000\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nunitary multiparty republic with one legislative house (National Assembly [921])\n\nOfficial Language:\n\nSpanish\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 8:29 PM ET (AP)\n\nBrazil expels Nicaraguan ambassador in retaliation as rift between leaders grows\n\nAlthough rapidly being depleted, Nicaragua’s fauna includes mammals such as pumas, jaguars, ocelots, margays, various monkeys, deer, and peccaries; birds range from eagles to egrets to macaws to pelicans; reptiles include crocodiles, snakes, turtles, and lizards; and a variety of toads, frogs, fishes, mollusks, and insects are also found. Fauna, like the flora, varies considerably from one ecosystem to another.\n\nPeople\n\nEthnic groups\n\nThe majority of Nicaraguans (between three-fifths and two-thirds of the total population) are mestizos—persons of mixed European and indigenous (Indian) ancestry. Whites, of European descent, constitute less than one-fifth of the total population, while people of African descent, indigenous people, and other groups collectively constitute nearly one-fourth of the total population.\n\nThe indigenous groups are split into two regions: the west coast has a small number of Monimbó and Subtiava groups, as well as the Matagalpa (whose language is extinct), who live in the west-central city of the same name, while the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama reside on the east coast. Also living in the eastern region are the Garifuna (formerly called Black Caribs), who are descendants of the Carib people and Africans exiled from British colonies in the eastern Caribbean (Lesser Antilles) in the 18th century, and Creoles, English-speaking blacks mainly from Jamaica. Spanish-speaking mestizos constitute the largest single group on the east coast, however.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe vast majority of Nicaraguans speak Spanish. It is the sole official language in all but the east coast regions where, under the 1987 constitution and the Atlantic Coast Autonomy Law enacted the same year, Miskito, Sumo, Rama, and Creole English have equal status with Spanish. On the west coast, indigenous languages have disappeared, even though their influence remains in place-names and many nouns in Nicaraguan Spanish.\n\nReligion\n\nThere is no official religion in Nicaragua, but about one-half of Nicaraguans adhere to Roman Catholicism. Since the 1980s Evangelical Protestantism has grown considerably, particularly among the poor, and it is the religion of about one-third of the population. There are small Moravian and Anglican communities on the Caribbean coast. A very small Jewish community exists in larger cities.\n\nSettlement patterns\n\nThe western volcanic mountains and surrounding lowlands and lakes contain the majority of the country’s population, most of its cities, and the bulk of its industry. The valleys of the western central mountains contain a substantial population. In the second half of the 20th century, many former inhabitants of the western region migrated to the large but sparsely populated eastern region to farm, raise cattle, or exploit timber resources. The area remains an agricultural centre, though some light industry has emerged.\n\nNearly three-fifths of Nicaragua’s population is urban. By far the largest city is Managua, on the southeastern shore of Lake Managua. Other important urban centres include León, Granada, Masaya, and Chinandega, all in the west. Matalgalpa, Estelí, Juigalpa, and Jinotega are among the largest cities of the central mountains. Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas (Bilwi) are the largest towns on the Caribbean coast.\n\nDemographic trends\n\nDespite the loss of nearly 30,000 people who were killed in the country’s civil war, and the hundreds of thousands who took refuge abroad, Nicaragua’s population increased from 2.5 million to nearly 4 million during Sandinista rule (1979–90). Declining infant mortality and a wartime “baby boom” are possible explanations. The war also spurred internal migration and a rapid expansion of cities. These factors, along with high fertility rates, have left the country with a young population. In the late 2010s more than three-tenths of the population was under age 15. Moreover, a restrictive abortion policy adopted in the first decade of the 21st century, which outlawed the procedure even in cases of rape or a life-threatening pregnancy, was expected to further increase the population.\n\nEconomy\n\nNicaragua is one of Latin America’s poorest countries and suffers from high unemployment rates and a large external debt. Remittances from Nicaraguans living abroad and foreign assistance are the country’s main sources of foreign income, though income from tourism has increased since the 1990s. A large proportion of Nicaraguans live in poverty.\n\nDuring the 1980s the cost inflicted by the revolution that overthrew the Somoza dictatorship and by the defense against counterrevolution worsened the country’s plight. The Sandinista policy of developing a mixed economy (about 60 percent private and 40 percent public) resulted in growth from 1980 through 1983; however, public spending on many state enterprises combined with continued price controls and subsidies led to economic problems. A trade embargo declared on Nicaragua by the United States in 1985, along with economic mismanagement by the Sandinista government, brought about economic decline, service shortages, war-driven inflation, and a growing foreign debt that lasted throughout the decade. In the late 1980s the Sandinistas implemented an austerity program featuring some privatization and sharp reductions in public employment.\n\nThe post-Sandinista government sought to remove most state control of the economy and accentuated austerity policies introduced by the Sandinistas. Privatization was accelerated, and government spending aimed at the country’s poor majority was curtailed. By the end of the century, with renewed U.S. assistance and aid from international lending agencies, inflation had been brought under control and minor growth was being achieved. However, the government’s implementation of austerity and structural-adjustment programs reduced or eliminated most government welfare and led to further impoverishment of the country’s poorest citizens.\n\nThe return to power of the Sandinistas and Daniel Ortega in 2007 brought the reintroduction of means-tested welfare programs, funded in large measure by foreign aid from Venezuela. Ortega’s government oversaw what it called the “popular economy,” under which worker-run and cooperative ventures that had emerged in the mixed economy and struggled but survived during the post-Sandinista transition to neoliberalism adapted to the Sandinistas’ newfound embrace of the free market. In many respects, Ortega allowed business in general a relatively free hand even as he was tightening his grip on civil society. The economy grew steadily, and poverty was reduced during the first 10 or so years of renewed Sandinista rule. However, the social upheaval occasioned by widespread protests in 2018 and the deleterious economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that reached Nicaragua in 2020 combined to put the economy back into a downturn."
