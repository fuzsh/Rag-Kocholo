        "text": "Travel Plug Adapter for Nicaragua\n\nThe electrical outlets used in Nicaragua are type A. You will therefore need a US to type A/B adapter in order to plug in your appliances.\n\nJump to our Recommended Adapters\n\nPlease be aware that whilst a travel adapter will allow you to physically plug a US plug into a different outlet it will not change the voltage or frequency of the supply.\n\nVoltage - The mains voltage in Nicaragua is 120 V which is compatible with all US appliances (US voltage is currently specified as 120 V + /- 5%).\n\nFrequency - The frequency is 60 Hz which is the same as the US.\n\nNeed another travel adapter? Search by Country\n\nPopular Travel Accessories\n\nJump to our Recommended Adapters\n\nMore Information\n\nFind loads of useful info about Nicaragua on wikitravel\n\nGovernment travel advice\n\nGlobal travel advisory map\n\nTravel weather\n\nLocal time in Nicaragua\n\nToday's exchange rates\n\nInteractive map - Zoom and pan to any country in the world.\n\nPlease note that while we take great care to give the best advice available our recommendations may not always be the most suitable for your particular circumstances. When you travel as much as we do you come to realise that some countries just don't know how to stick to the rules! Please use our recommendations responsibly and do some extra research on the particular area that you are travelling to if necessary.\n\nTip: If you are not located in the UK or USA just click on the picture that shows your domestic plug or socket / outlet type and we'll know what you need.\n\nAlternatively if we do not support your specific plug / socket types yet you can close this and view the site with default settings.\n\nYou can change your preference at any time by clicking on the flag icons at the top of the page."
