Nicaragua has successfully incorporated reproductive rights in its health and education laws and policies, and made headway in reducing maternal mortality. But key challenges remain, including a high adolescent pregnancy rate. UNFPA strengthens capacities to provide high quality maternal health and newborn care, comprehensive sexuality education for young people, and investments in the country’s “demographic dividend”. It also backs measures to prevent and respond to gender-based violence.\n\nPlease wait...\n\nProgramme Activities\n\nSelect Year:\n\nAll resources\n\nCore\n\nNon - core\n\nNicaragua 2014 Programme
