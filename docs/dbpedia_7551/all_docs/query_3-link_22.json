Geographic coordinates: 13:00 North, 85:00 West.\n\nPopulation\n\nNicaragua’s population of 6.3 million is concentrated mostly in the western regions of the country. The largest ethnic population is mestizo, or mixed European and indigenous, with smaller groups of whites, blacks of Jamaican origin, and other indigenous minorities.\n\nThe culture of Nicaragua reflects the mixed Ibero-European and Indian ancestry of the majority of its people.\n\nArea\n\n130,668 sq. km. (50,451 sq. mi.). Slightly larger than the state of New York, Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America.\n\nThe extensive Atlantic coastal plain rises to the central interior mountains, which drop off to a narrow Pacific coastal plain interrupted by volcanoes. Highest elevation: Mogotón 2,107 m. (6,912 ft.). Nicaragua claims the largest expanse of tropical rainforest north of the Amazon, covering much of the northern and eastern regions. The mountains and the western part of the country are somewhat more arid. There are many lakes and rivers accounting for some 9,240 sq. km. (3,568 sq. mi.) of the country’s total surface area. Lake Nicaragua, Central America’s largest, covers more than 8,000 sq. km. (3,089 sq. mi.), while Lake Managua reaches more than 1,000 sq. km. (386 sq. mi.).\n\nCurrency\n\nCórdoba (C).
