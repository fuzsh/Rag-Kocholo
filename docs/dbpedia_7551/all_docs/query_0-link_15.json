We offer low cost and high quality travel insurance to Nicaragua and most of the world.\n\nDirect Travel Insurance Guide to Nicaragua\n\nNicaragua is a Spanish-speaking country in Central America, home to just over six million people. The population is multi-ethnic, including indigenous peoples, Europeans, Africans, Asians, and people of Middle Eastern origin. Many native tribes on the east coast of the country speak their own languages.\n\nThe capital city, Managua, is nicknamed Novia del Xolotlán (“The Bride of Xolotlán”), as it sits on the southwest shore of Lake Xolotlán (also known as Lake Managua). 2,100 year old footprints have been discovered preserved in the volcanic mud on the shores of Lake Managua, and are known as the Ancient Footprints of Acahualinca.\n\nThe rainy season in Nicaragua runs from May to November, and the country can be affected by hurricanes during this time. Much of Western Nicaragua, including the capital, has a tropical climate. Temperatures throughout the year average between 28 and 32 degrees. Temperatures are highest in March, April, and May, at an average of 34 degrees.\n\nBanks in Nicaragua cannot change sterling (GBP) currency. You can exchange US dollars in cash or travellers cheques. ATMs will allow you to withdraw US dollars or Cordobas.\n\nThere is no British Embassy in Nicaragua. You should contact the British Honorary Consul in Managua via the British Embassy, Costa Rica, if you need emergency consular assistance.\n\nBritish nationals can visit Nicaragua for up to three months without a visa, however, you may be asked to provide proof of your onward travel. There is an arrival tax, which should be paid in cash. Passports should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date of entry into Nicaragua."
