A value below 2.1 will cause the native population to decline\n\nLife Expectancy in Nicaragua\n\nSee also: Countries in the world ranked by Life Expectancy\n\nInfant Mortality Rate and Deaths of Children under 5 Years Old in Nicaragua\n\nNicaragua Urban Population\n\nCurrently, 58.0 % of the population of Nicaragua is urban (4,011,856 people in 2024)\n\nPopulation Density\n\nThe 2024 population density in Nicaragua is 57 people per Km2 (149 people per mi2), calculated on a total land area of 120,340 Km2 (46,464 sq. miles).\n\nLargest Cities in Nicaragua\n\nSee also\n\nPopulation of Nicaragua\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) of Nicaragua\n\nDemographics of Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nWorld Demographics\n\nDemographics\n\nPopulation\n\nSources\n\nWorld Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision - United Nations Population Division\n\nWorld Urbanization Prospects - Population Division - United Nations\n\nGeoNames\n\nUnited Nations Statistics Division\n\nWorld Bank\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n\nDefinitions\n\nPopulation Pyramid\n\nA Population pyramid (also called \"Age-Sex Pyramid\") is a graphical representation of the age and sex of a population.\n\nTypes:\n\nStages:\n\nDependency Ratio\n\nThere are three types of age dependency ratio: Youth, Elderly, and Total. All three ratios are commonly multiplied by 100.\n\nYouth Dependency Ratio\n\nDefinition: population ages 0-15 divided by the population ages 16-64.\n\nFormula: ([Population ages 0-15] ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100\n\nElderly dependency ratio\n\nDefinition: population ages 65-plus divided by the population ages 16-64.\n\nFormula: ([Population ages 65-plus] ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100\n\nTotal dependency ratio\n\nDefinition: sum of the youth and old-age ratios.\n\nFormula: (([Population ages 0-15] + [Population ages 65-plus]) ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100\n\nNOTE: Dependency Ratio does not take into account labor force participation rates by age group. Some portion of the population counted as \"working age\" may actually be unemployed or not in the labor force whereas some portion of the \"dependent\" population may be employed and not necessarily economically dependent."
