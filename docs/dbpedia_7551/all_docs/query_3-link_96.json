USCIS continues to accept Form I-134A; however, no requests will be confirmed until the review of the supporter application process is complete. Beneficiaries who have already received an ATA should check their myUSCIS account for updates before making travel arrangements and prior to travel. Individuals with a valid ATA are permitted to travel. ATA processing will restart as soon as possible once this thorough review concludes.\n\nAlert Type info\n\nALERT: You are likely eligible to apply for an employment authorization document (EAD) to legally work in the United States if:\n\nYou were recently paroled into the United States and that parole remains valid; or\n\nYou have applied for asylum and that application has been pending for at least 150 days.\n\nIf you have not already started the EAD application process, you can begin here by creating a USCIS account online and filing Form-I-765. We will mail your work permit to the address you provided in your application if your application is approved. If necessary, you can file a paper application for Form I-765 instead.\n\nAlert Type info\n\nALERT: Updated Review Process for the Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans\n\nThe U.S. government may grant advance travel authorization to up to 30,000 noncitizens each month to seek parole on a case-by-case basis under the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. Due to high interest in these processes, we are updating the review process effective May 17, 2023. Under the new review process, we will randomly select about half of the monthly total of Forms I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, regardless of filing date, from the entire pending workload to review. We will review the other half of the monthly total of Forms I-134A based on when the case was submitted under the first-in, first-out method, which prioritizes the oldest Forms I-134A for review. This is intended to maintain a meaningful and equitable opportunity for all beneficiaries of a Form I-134A to move forward through the process and seek advance travel authorization. For more information, see our web alert.\n\nAlert Type info\n\nALERT: Access to the processes is free. Neither the U.S.-based supporter nor the beneficiary is required to pay the U.S. government a fee to file the Form I-134A, be considered for travel authorization, or parole. Beware of any scams or potential exploitation by anyone who asks for money associated with participation in this process.\n\nDHS has announced processes through which nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and their immediate family members, may request to come to the United States in a safe and orderly way. Qualified beneficiaries who are outside the United States and lack U.S. entry documents may be considered, on a case-by-case basis, for advanced authorization to travel and a temporary period of parole for up to two years for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. To participate, eligible beneficiaries must:\n\nHave a supporter in the United States;\n\nUndergo and clear robust security vetting;\n\nMeet other eligibility criteria; and\n\nWarrant a favorable exercise of discretion.\n\nIndividuals participating in these processes must have a supporter in the United States who agrees to provide them with financial support for the duration of their parole in the United States. The first step in the process is for the U.S.-based supporter to file a Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, with USCIS for each beneficiary they seek to support, including minor children. The U.S. government will then review the supporter information provided in the Form I-134A to ensure that they are able to financially support the beneficiaries they are agreeing to support.\n\nSee below for additional information on the processes and country specific eligibility requirements. Additional information is also available on our Frequently Asked Questions About the Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans page.\n\nEligibility\n\nTermDefinitionSupporter\n\nAn individual who holds lawful status in the United States or is a parolee or beneficiary of deferred action or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) who has passed security and background vetting and demonstrated sufficient financial resources to receive, maintain, and support the individual(s) whom they commit to supporting for the duration of their stay in the United States.\n\nExamples of individuals who meet the supporter requirement include:\n\nU.S. citizens and nationals;\n\nLawful permanent residents, lawful temporary residents, and conditional permanent residents;\n\nNonimmigrants in lawful status (who maintain their nonimmigrant status and have not violated any of the terms or conditions of their nonimmigrant status);\n\nAsylees, refugees, and parolees;\n\nIndividuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS); and\n\nBeneficiaries of deferred action (including deferred action for childhood arrivals) or DED.\n\nBeneficiary\n\nA national of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela (or their immediate family member of any nationality) who is outside the United States and who may be considered for parole under these processes.\n\nImmediate family members of any nationality in these processes include:\n\nA spouse or common-law partner; and\n\nUnmarried child(ren) under the age of 21. NOTE: If a child is under 18, they must be traveling with a parent or legal guardian in order to use this process.\n\nWho May be Considered for Advance Travel Authorization\n\nIn order to be eligible to request and ultimately be considered for an advance authorization to travel to the United States to seek parole under these processes, beneficiaries must:\n\nBe outside the United States;\n\nBe a national of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela; or be an immediate family member (spouse, common-law partner, and/or unmarried child under the age of 21) who is traveling with an eligible Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan;\n\nHave a U.S.-based supporter who filed a Form I-134A on their behalf that USCIS has vetted and confirmed;\n\nPossess an unexpired passport valid for international travel;\n\nProvide for their own commercial travel to an air U.S. port of entry and final U.S. destination;\n\nUndergo and pass required national security and public safety vetting;\n\nComply with all additional requirements, including vaccination requirements and other public health guidelines; and\n\nDemonstrate that a grant of parole is warranted based on significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons, and that a favorable exercise of discretion is otherwise merited.\n\nAn individual is ineligible to be considered for parole under these processes if that person is a dual national or permanent resident of, or holds refugee status in, another country, unless DHS operates a similar parole process for the country’s nationals. This requirement does not apply to immediate family members (spouse, common-law partner, or unmarried child under the age of 21) of an eligible national of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela with whom they are traveling.\n\nIn addition, a potential beneficiary is ineligible for advance authorization to travel to the United States as well as parole under these processes if that person:\n\nFails to pass national security and public safety vetting or is otherwise deemed not to merit a favorable exercise of discretion;\n\nHas been ordered removed from the United States within the prior five years or is subject to a bar to admissibility based on a prior removal order;\n\nHas crossed irregularly into the United States, between the ports of entry, after the date the process was announced (for Venezuelans, after Oct. 19, 2022; for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, after Jan. 9, 2023), except individuals permitted a single instance of voluntary departure pursuant to INA § 240B, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c or withdrawal of their application for admission pursuant to INA § 235(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(4) will remain eligible;\n\nHas irregularly crossed the Mexican or Panamanian border after the date the process was announced (for Venezuelans, after Oct. 19, 2022; for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, after Jan. 9, 2023);\n\nIs Cuban or Haitian and has been interdicted at sea after April 27, 2023; or\n\nIs under 18 and not traveling through this process accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nImportant Note about Venezuelan Passports\n\nThe beneficiary must have a valid, unexpired passport. Certified extensions of passport validity serve to meet this requirement. If a beneficiary's passport validity has been extended, the expiration date of the extension should be reflected as the passport expiration date. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will not authorize travel if the beneficiary's passport or extension is expired.\n\nSpecific to Venezuelan passports, consistent with the National Assembly decree of June 25, 2024, Venezuelan passports issued before the date of this decree remain valid for ten years beyond the expiration date printed in the passport or beyond the expiration date of the last passport extension (\"prórroga\"), whichever is later.\n\nUnaccompanied Children\n\nChildren under the age of 18 arriving without their parent or legal guardian are not eligible for advance authorization to travel or consideration for parole under the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. If a child under age 18 arrives at a U.S. port of entry and is not traveling with their parent or legal guardian, they may be placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as required by law under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. For more information, please visit the HHS Unaccompanied Children webpage.\n\nChildren under age 18 who are not traveling with a parent or legal guardian, but who are coming to the United States to meet a parent or legal guardian, may instead seek parole through the standard Form I-131 parole process. In the standard Form I-131 parole process, children under age 18 who travel without a parent or legal guardian will need, among other evidence, written permission from all adults with legal custody of the child (that is, their parents or legal guardians) to travel to the United States.\n\nAdditional evidence submitted with the Form I-131 should include:\n\nThe duration of their stay in the United States; and\n\nEvidence of relationship between the child under age 18 and the parent or legal guardian that the child is traveling to reunite with in the United States (see Step 5, below).\n\nIf the legal guardian is providing the written permission, the requestor must include proof of legal guardianship issued by the appropriate government authority. In addition, the application should include a statement about the relationship of the child to the person filing the Form I-131, and whether they intend to provide care and custody of the child in the United States or reunite the child with a parent or legal guardian in the United States. For more information, please see our Guidance on Evidence for Certain Types of Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole page, which has information about the requirements for requesting parole for children.\n\nYou may request a fee waiver when submitting a Form I-131 for a child as described in the above paragraph. For more information on how to request a fee waiver, please see the Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, webpage.\n\nPathway for Children Under Age 18 Outside the United States Who Have Parents or Legal Guardians in the United States\n\nIf a child’s parents or legal guardians have lawful status in the United States, are parolees (including a parolee under the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans), or are beneficiaries of deferred action or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), and the parents or legal guardians have documentation or authorization to reenter the United States after returning from a trip outside the United States, they may be eligible to travel outside the United States to accompany their child to the United States. The child must otherwise be eligible for consideration for parole under the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, or Venezuelans.\n\nTo request consideration under the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, or Venezuelans, a supporter must submit a Form I-134A on behalf of the child under age 18 seeking to reunite with their parent or legal guardian in the United States. The parent or legal guardian of the child may file Form I-134A on the child’s behalf if the parent or legal guardian has lawful status in the United States, is a parolee, or is a beneficiary of deferred action or DED. However, the U.S.-based supporter does not need to be related to the beneficiary for whom they have filed Form I-134A.\n\nAfter we have confirmed the Form I-134A, the supporter should follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Log in to their online account.\n\nStep 2: From the top of the webpage, select the My Account drop-down menu and select Inbox.\n\nStep 3: Click on the New Message button.\n\nStep 4: For the subject, select “Other” from the drop-down menu, and for the case receipt number, select the receipt number for Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support.\n\nStep 5: In the message field, write “CHNV Child Reunification” and state that they are contacting USCIS on behalf of a child under age 18 who is eligible for the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, or Venezuelans, and who has a parent or legal guardian who can depart and reenter the United States to accompany their child so the child can use the processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, or Venezuelans. In addition, the supporter should upload in their online account this supporting documentation:\n\nEvidence of the parental relationship or legal guardianship of the child. (Evidence may include a birth certificate for the child and identity documents for the parent or legal guardian. Generally, evidence of legal guardianship requires a legal or administrative process involving the courts or other recognized government entity. A power of attorney or written or notarized statement is not a formally recognized arrangement.)\n\nEvidence that the parent or legal guardian has documentation or authorization to reenter the United States. This documentation may include proof of U.S. citizenship, a Green Card, or an Advance Parole Document (Application for Travel Document, Form I-131).\n\nA signed statement affirming that the parent or legal guardian will accompany the child to the United States and provide care and physical custody of that child in the United States.\n\nWho Can be a Supporter\n\nU.S.-based supporters will initiate an online request on behalf of a named beneficiary, by submitting a Form I-134A to USCIS for each beneficiary, including minor children. Supporters can be individuals filing independently, filing with other individuals, or filing on behalf of organizations, businesses, or other entities. There is no fee required to file Form I-134A. The supporter will be vetted by the U.S. government to protect against exploitation and abuse and to ensure that they are able to financially support the beneficiary they are agreeing to support.\n\nTo serve as a supporter, an individual or individual representing an entity must:\n\nBe a U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident; hold a lawful status in the United States such as Temporary Protected Status or asylum; or be a parolee or recipient of deferred action or Deferred Enforced Departure;\n\nPass security and background vetting, including for public safety, national security, human trafficking, and exploitation concerns; and\n\nDemonstrate sufficient financial resources to receive, maintain, and support the individual(s) they are agreeing to support for the duration of their parole period.\n\nSupporters who file Form I-134A on behalf of a beneficiary under these processes must be willing and able to receive, maintain, and support the beneficiary listed in Form I-134A for the duration of their parole. Examples of the types of support for beneficiaries that supporters should keep in mind when considering their ability to meet this commitment include:\n\nReceiving the beneficiary upon arrival in the United States and transporting them to initial housing;\n\nEnsuring that the beneficiary has safe and appropriate housing for the duration of their parole and initial basic necessities;\n\nAs appropriate, helping the beneficiary complete necessary paperwork such as for employment authorization, for a Social Security card, and for services for which they may be eligible;\n\nEnsuring that the beneficiary’s health care and medical needs are met for the duration of the parole; and\n\nAs appropriate, assisting the beneficiary with accessing education, learning English, securing employment, and enrolling children in school.\n\nSupporters must include the name of the beneficiary on Form I-134A. Supporters may not file a Form I-134A on behalf of an unnamed beneficiary. A supporter may agree to support more than one beneficiary, such as for different members of a family group, but must file a separate Form I-134A for each beneficiary.\n\nSupporters must file a separate Form I-134A for each beneficiary, even minor children. Multiple supporters may join together to support a beneficiary. In this case, a supporter should file a Form I-134A and in the filing include supplementary evidence demonstrating the identity of, and resources to be provided by, the additional supporters and attach a statement explaining the intent to share responsibility to support the beneficiary. These supporters’ ability to support a beneficiary will be assessed collectively.\n\nOrganizations, businesses, and other entities can play a critical role in providing support for beneficiaries arriving through this process. Although an individual is required to file and sign the Form I-134A, they can do so in association with or on behalf of an organization, business, or other entity that will provide some or all of the necessary support to the beneficiary. Individual supporters filing with or on behalf of an organization, business, or other entity should submit evidence of the entity’s commitment to support the beneficiary when they file the Form I-134A. This can be demonstrated through a letter of commitment or other documentation from an officer or other credible representative of the organization, business, or other entity describing the monetary or other types of support (such as housing, basic necessities, transportation, etc.) the entity will be providing to the specific beneficiary. Individuals who are filing in association with an organization, business, or other entity do not need to submit their personal financial information, if the level of support demonstrated by the entity is sufficient to support the beneficiary.\n\nOrganizations outside of the government may be able to help potential supporters and beneficiaries to prepare for this process. Two organizations that specialize in providing the public with information about providing welcome to newcomers and resources to support participation in these processes are listed below.\n\nWelcome.us provides information on welcoming and supporting newcomer populations.\n\nCommunity Sponsorship Hub has established the Sponsor Circle Program, which can provide resources and ongoing guidance to supporters.\n\nThis information is provided for informational purposes only. DHS does not endorse these entities. Using these entities in lieu of any other entity does not give any parolee preferential treatment in the adjudication of their application.\n\nProcess Steps\n\nBeneficiaries cannot directly apply for these processes. A supporter in the United States must first complete and file Form I-134A with USCIS on behalf of a beneficiary and include information about them and contact details, such as an email address. If we deem the Form I-134A sufficient, in our discretion, we will send the beneficiary information about the next step in the process to be considered for authorization to travel to the United States and parole consideration at an airport of entry.\n\nOnce beneficiaries receive their travel authorization, they should arrange to fly directly to their final destination in the United States. Upon arrival at the interior port of entry, individuals will be inspected by CBP and required to submit additional information, to include fingerprints, for further biometric vetting, and then be considered for a discretionary grant of parole. Those who attempt to enter the U.S. at land ports of entry will not be considered for parole through this process and will generally be denied entry.\n\nThe key steps in the processes include:\n\nStep 1: Financial Support\n\nA U.S.-based supporter will submit a Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, with USCIS through the online myUSCIS web portal to initiate the process. The Form I-134A identifies and collects information on both the supporter and the beneficiary. The supporter must submit a separate Form I-134A for each beneficiary they are seeking to support, including immediate family members and minor children.\n\nWe will then vet the supporter to ensure that they are able to financially support the individual they are agreeing to support and to protect against exploitation and abuse. USCIS, in our discretion, must vet and confirm supporters before they move forward in the process.\n\nStep 2: Submit Biographic Information\n\nIf we confirm a supporter, the listed beneficiary will receive an email from us with instructions on how to create a USCIS online account and other next steps. The beneficiary must confirm their biographic information in myUSCIS and attest to meeting the eligibility requirements.\n\nAs part of confirming eligibility in their online account, individuals who seek authorization to travel to the United States must confirm that they meet public health requirements, including certain vaccination requirements.\n\nStep 3: Submit Request in CBP One Mobile Application\n\nAfter confirming biographic information in their online account and completing required eligibility attestations, the beneficiary will receive instructions through myUSCIS on how to access the CBP One mobile application (PDF, 771.55 KB). The beneficiary must enter their biographic information into CBP One and provide a photo.\n\nStep 4: Advance Travel Authorization to the United States\n\nAfter completing Step 3, the beneficiary will receive a notice in their online account confirming whether CBP will, in its discretion, provide them with advance authorization to travel to the United States to seek a discretionary grant of parole on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIf approved, this authorization is valid for 90 days. Beneficiaries are responsible for securing their own travel via air to the United States. Approval of advance authorization to travel does not guarantee entry or parole into the United States at a U.S. port of entry. Parole is a discretionary determination made by CBP at the port of entry, based on a finding that parole is warranted due to urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\n\nStep 5: Seeking Parole at the Port of Entry\n\nWhen a beneficiary arrives a port of entry, CBP will inspect them and consider them for a grant of discretionary parole on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs part of the inspection, beneficiaries will undergo additional screening and vetting, to include additional fingerprint biometric vetting consistent with the CBP inspection process. Individuals who are determined to pose a national security or public safety threat, or otherwise not warrant parole as a matter of discretion upon inspection, will be processed under an appropriate processing pathway and may be referred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nStep 6: Parole\n\nIndividuals granted parole under these processes generally will be paroled into the United States for a period of up to two years, subject to applicable health and vetting requirements, and will be eligible to apply for employment authorization under existing regulations.\n\nIndividuals granted parole may request work authorization from USCIS by filing a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, either online or via mail.\n\nWhat to Expect After Filing Form I-134A\n\nAfter the supporter files the Form I-134A with USCIS, we will review the form and supporting evidence to ensure that the supporter has sufficient financial resources to support the beneficiary for the duration of the parole period and conduct background checks on the supporter. We will determine whether the Form I-134A is sufficient, and we may request additional evidence to make our determination. If approved, beneficiaries will receive an email from USCIS with instructions on how to set up a USCIS online account and other next steps. Individuals should check their email, including spam and junk folders, for important messages from USCIS.\n\nIf the Form I-134A is Sufficient\n\nIf we confirm in our discretion that the Form I-134A is sufficient, the beneficiary will receive an email from USCIS with instructions on how to set up a USCIS online account and other next steps. The beneficiary must confirm their biographic information on myUSCIS and attest to completion of all requirements, including:\n\nAn attestation affirming that\n\nyou are not a permanent resident or dual national of any country other than your country of nationality, and that you do not currently hold refugee status in any country, unless DHS operates a similar parole process for the country’s nationals; or\n\nyou are the spouse, common-law partner, or unmarried child under the age of 21 and traveling with an eligible national;\n\nAn attestation to certify understanding of the family relationship requirements for children under 18; and\n\nAn attestation that you have completed vaccine requirements or are eligible for an exception to vaccine requirements for measles, polio, and the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine approved or authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Emergency Use Listed (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, the beneficiary must attest to receiving a medical screening for tuberculosis, including an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test, within 90 days.\n\nFind more information on vaccine requirements on the preview of the vaccine attestation page .\n\nIf the Form I-134A is Insufficient\n\nIf we are unable to confirm the Form I-134A is sufficient, that decision is final. The beneficiary will receive an email from USCIS notifying them that we determined the Form I-134A filed on their behalf was insufficient. We will not consider the beneficiary for parole under this parole process based on the insufficient Form I-134A. However, the supporter may file a new Form I-134A on behalf of the same or another beneficiary, or a different supporter may file a Form I-134A on behalf of the beneficiary.\n\nAuthorization to Travel to the United States\n\nOnce the beneficiary has confirmed their biographic information and attested to completing all other requirements, we will process their case further. Beneficiaries will receive an email instructing them to check their online account in myUSCIS for the result of their authorization to travel. This authorization is valid for 90 days.\n\nIf the beneficiary has been authorized to travel to the United States, they must arrange and fund their own travel. Beneficiaries must arrange to fly to the United States by air directly to an interior port of entry and their final destination.\n\nAfter the Beneficiary is Paroled into the United States\n\nApplying for Employment Authorization\n\nAfter you are paroled into the United States, you are eligible to apply for discretionary employment authorization from USCIS. To apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), you must submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, using the (c)(11) category code with the required fee, or apply for a fee waiver.\n\nTo file Form I-765 online, eligible applicants will access their USCIS online account at my.uscis.gov.\n\nYou can find the filing fee for Form I-765 by visiting our Fee Schedule page.\n\nApplicants who are requesting a waiver of the Form I-765 filing fee must submit Form I-765 by mail with Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver.\n\nObtaining a Social Security Number and Card\n\nWe encourage you to apply for a Social Security number (SSN) using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and following the form instructions. If you request an SSN in Part 2 (Items 13.a-17.b) of your Form I-765, and we approve your Form I-765, we will electronically transmit that data to the Social Security Administration (SSA), and SSA will assign you an SSN and issue you a Social Security card. SSA will mail your Social Security card directly to the address you provide on Form I-765. SSNs generally are assigned to people who are authorized to work in the United States. SSNs are used to report your wages to the government and to determine your eligibility for Social Security benefits.\n\nIf you do not request an SSN on your Form I-765, you can apply for an SSN after you receive your EAD from USCIS using the instructions on SSA’s Social Security Number and Card webpage.\n\nAddress Updates\n\nIf you are residing in the United States longer than 30 days, you must report your physical address in the United States. If your address changes after you enter the United States, you must notify us within 10 days of the change, by either:\n\nUsing our online change of address form; or\n\nThrough your existing USCIS online account (if you have an account). For more information on how to create an online account, visit the How to Create a USCIS Online Account.\n\nChanging your address online will update the address on file with USCIS for each pending application, petition, or request for which you provide a receipt number when filling out the Online Change of Address form. It is important to include the receipt number for any cases pending with USCIS in your address change request, so that we can update the address associated with those cases. We will mail secure documents to the address on file. You can find the receipt number on the receipt notice (Form I-797C, Notice of Action) that we issued after you filed your application, petition, or request. We send receipt notices to the address listed on the application, petition, or request.\n\nTerminating Your Parole\n\nIf you have already been paroled into the United States, your parole will automatically be terminated if:\n\nYou depart the United States (without an Advance Parole Document before traveling outside the United States); or\n\nYour parole period expires.\n\nDHS may also decide to terminate your parole at its discretion for other reasons, such as violating any laws of the United States. We expect you will leave the country when your parole expires. If you stay in the United States after your parole expires, officials who encounter you may refer you to ICE for immigration proceedings.\n\nLeaving the United States\n\nIf we grant you travel authorization, you may present it only once for travel to the United States to seek parole at the U.S. port of entry. After you are paroled into the United States, if you want to leave the United States and then return as a parolee, you must request an Advance Parole Document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, before traveling outside the United States. If you leave the United States without getting an Advance Parole Document, your parole will be terminated when you depart.

Neither the supporter nor the beneficiary is required to pay the U.S. government a fee for the Form I-134A. Beware of any scams or potential exploitation by anyone who asks for money associated with the Form I-134A or participation in these processes.\n\nDHS recommends the following actions to avoid intimidating situations:\n\nAvoid individuals who promise to “get you to the United States quickly” if you pay an exorbitant sum of money.\n\nKeep your passport and other identity documents in your possession at all times.\n\nIf you are concerned that the individual who filed Form I-134A on your behalf is not a legitimate organization or entity or legal representative, see the Scams, Fraud, and Misconduct webpage.\n\nCall the 24-hour National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or report an emergency to law enforcement by calling 911.

In the United States, there are laws that may help you avoid or escape an abusive situation.\n\nDomestic Violence is a pattern of behavior in a relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner, parent, or child. Domestic abuse can involve physical, sexual, emotional, financial, or psychological abuse or threats.\n\nForced marriage is a marriage that takes place without the consent of one or both people in the marriage. Consent means that you have given your full, free, and informed agreement to marry your intended spouse and to the timing of the marriage. Forced marriage may occur when family members or others use physical or emotional abuse, threats, or deception to force you to marry without your consent. For additional information on forced marriage, please visit the Forced Marriage webpage.\n\nHuman Trafficking involves exploiting someone to compel a commercial sex act or forced labor. Generally, this exploitation must involve force, fraud, or coercion to be considered human trafficking. However, if someone under 18 years old is induced to perform a commercial sex act, that is considered human trafficking even if there is no force, fraud, or coercion.\n\nIf you have experienced or fear forced marriage, domestic violence, human trafficking, or other abuse, please contact the resources below to receive free help in your language:\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline: 800-799-7233, 800-787-3224 (TTY), www.ndvh.org\n\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children: 800-843-5678, www.missingkids.com\n\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime: 800-394-2255, 800-211-7996 (TTY), www.victimsofcrime.org\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline: 888-373-7888, Text: 233733\n\nFor more information and additional resources related to gender-based violence, see the DHS Gender-Based Violence Pamphlets.\n\nProtect Yourself from Immigration Scams\n\nWe do not want you to become the victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or accredited representative working for a Department of Justice recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.\n\nSome common scams to be aware of include:\n\nGovernment impersonators: Look out for individuals who pose as USCIS officials. USCIS will only contact you through official government channels and will not contact you through your personal social media accounts (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).\n\nMisleading offers of support: Look out for individuals who attempt to contact you online or through your social media accounts to offer to be your supporter or connect you to a supporter in exchange for a fee or other form of compensation. Similarly, look out for individuals seeking biographic information from you, such as your passport number or date of birth, through your social media accounts, to offer to support you for parole. Supporters should be able to provide financial support to beneficiaries for up to a 2-year period of parole. Beneficiaries are not obligated to repay, reimburse, work for, serve, marry, or otherwise compensate their supporter in exchange for the potential supporter submitting Form I-134A, Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support, on their behalf or for providing financial support while they are in the United States.

Make sure the website address ends with .gov.\n\nPayments by Phone or Email: We will never ask you to transfer money to an individual. We do not accept Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, or gift cards as payment for immigration fees.
