        "text": "Understanding Population Growth Rate: How Births, Deaths, and Migration Impact Population Size of Nicaragua\n\nPopulation growth rate is defined as the annual average rate of change of population size, for a given country, territory, or geographic area, during a specified period. It is considered an international standard for measuring population change. The United Nations uses population growth rate as one of the key indicators for measuring population trends, and for forecasting future population size. Part of that data is used on this page to visualize and explore historic and future population growth rate over time.\n\nWhat is Population Growth Rate?\n\nPopulation growth rate is a measure of how quickly a population is increasing or decreasing in size over time. It is expressed as a percentage of change over a time period. Most commonly, its typically messured on a yearly basis, allowing you to evaluate percentage on year over year basis. However, population growth rate can be applied and calculated on any timeframe.\n\nPopulation growth rate is used to indicate population increase or decrease in size over time.\n\nIt is measured as a percentage of change, from previous to current population size.\n\nIt is often expressed as a yearly rate, but can be applied to any timeframe.\n\nA positive population growth rate indicates that a population is increasing.\n\nA negative population growth rate indicates that a population is decreasing.\n\nBirth rate, death rate, and migration affect the population growth rate.\n\nA high birth rate and low death rate will result in a high population growth rate.\n\nA low birth rate and high death rate will result in a low population growth rate.\n\nNet migration also affect the population growth rate of Nicaragua.\n\nPopulation growth rate is an important metric for demographic, environmental and economic forecasting.\n\nHow is Population Growth Rate calculated?\n\nThe population growth rate indicates the increase or decrease of a population in percent (%). The formula to calculate population growth rate can be used on any timeframe. In this case it indicates the population growth reate year over year, where a negative population growth rate is presented with red coloring and positive with green. The population growth rate of Nicaragua is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.\n\nPopulation Growth Rate Formula\n\nPopulation Growth Rate = New Population - Original Population / Original Population * 100\n\nWhat Causes Population Growth Rate to Increase or Decrease?\n\nJust like any other country or region, Nicaragua's population growth rate is influenced by a variety of factors that causes it to increase or decrease.\n\nBirth Rate\n\nThe number of births per 1,000 individuals in a population over a specific period of time affects population growth. Higher birth rates contribute to population growth, while lower birth rates slow down growth.\n\nDeath Rate\n\nThe number of deaths per 1,000 individuals in a population over a specific period of time also influences population growth. Higher death rates can reduce population growth, while lower death rates contribute to growth.\n\nTotal Fertility Rate\n\nThe average number of children born to women of childbearing age is known as the total fertility rate. Higher fertility rates can lead to population growth, while lower fertility rates can result in slower growth or even population decline.\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nThe average number of years a person is expected to live affects population growth. Higher life expectancy can result in population growth, as people live longer and contribute to the population for a greater duration.\n\nImmigration and Emigration\n\nMigration patterns, including immigration (inflow of individuals from other countries) and emigration (outflow of individuals to other countries), can significantly impact population growth rates. Higher immigration rates can contribute to population growth, while high emigration rates can slow down growth.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nGovernment policies related to family planning, healthcare, immigration, and social welfare can also influence population growth rates. For example, policies promoting contraception and family planning can lead to lower birth rates and slower growth.\n\nSocioeconomic Factors\n\nFactors such as economic development, education, and urbanization can affect population growth rates. Higher levels of education and economic opportunities often correlate with lower birth rates and slower population growth."
