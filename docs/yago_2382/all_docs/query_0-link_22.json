We first met when we were cast in a really terrible play.\n\n\"She was just a nice person who was just as bored of the play as I was. Pru is known for the many characters she has played on screen.\n\n\"When I first met Pru I was married with a young daughter, but the relationship was falling apart. Pru and I stayed in touch and we started writing letters to each other, we loved letters.\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nJohn Cleese’s pal Timothy West concerned about Fawlty Towers remake [LATEST]\n\nPrunella Scales’ husband shares heartbreaking update on her dementia [INSIGHT]\n\nAll Creatures Great and Small star details ban on famous parents [WATCH ]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We are very happy and very fortunate really.\"\n\nThe One Show airs weeknights from 7pm on BBC One."
