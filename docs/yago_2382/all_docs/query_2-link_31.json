Her first taste of employment came as an assistant stage manager at the Old Vic, but she craved a career in acting.\n\nBest known for playing Sybil Fawlty in the 1970s BBC sitcom Fawlty Towers, her long list of television credits includes roles in Pride and Prejudice, Champion Road, The Secret Garden, The Marriage Lines, Lucky Feller, Mr. Big, S.W.A.L.K., Mop and Smiff, Mapp & Lucia, After Henry, The Rector's Wife, Signs and Wonders, Searching, Silent Witness, Casualty, Where the Heart Is, The Shell Seekers and The Royal.\n\nFilm roles include Laxdale Hall, Hobson's Choice, The Crowded Day, Waltz of the Toreadors, On the Margin, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Boys from Brazil, Consuming Passions, Howards End, Wolf, Mad Cows, The Ghost of Greville Lodge, Johnny English and Run for Your Wife.\n\nNumerous stage credits include productions of Traveller Without Luggage, The Prodigious Snob, The Lady's Not for Burning, The Matchmaker, The Iceman Cometh, The Man-Eaters, The Trigon, Hay Fever, Breezeblock Park, What the Butler Saw, An Englishman Abroad, Single Spies, The Birthday Party, The Cherry Orchard, A Woman of No Importance and Carrie's War.\n\nPrunella is married to the actor Timothy West, who appeared on Coronation Street as retiree Eric Babbage in February 2013. Together, the couple presented ten series of the Channel 4 documentary Great Canal Journeys. Several years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the curtain came down on her almost seven-decade television career in early 2020, due to deteriorating health.\n\nRoles in Coronation Street[]\n\nExternal pages[]"
