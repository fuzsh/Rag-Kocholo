        "text": "Timothy West discusses Prunella Scales's 'memory problem'\n\nTimothy West, 88, has opened up about his wife Prunella Scales’ battle with dementia.\n\nSpeaking to Saga Magazine, Timothy shared the challenges that the couple have faced following her diagnosis.\n\nHe said: “For someone like Pru with any form of progressive dementia, the prognosis is not that cheerful.\n\n\"But she seems to manage incredibly well with things, as I try to, but surely she must sometimes wonder whether she is going to be allowed to end her days in this house that has been so dear to us.\n\n\"Not recognising me hasn’t been a problem, but it will come, I’m sure.”\n\nREAD MORE Inside Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas' age gap, split and health woes [LATEST]\n\nPrunella, 91, who is best known for her role as Sybil Fawlty in the hit BBC comedy Fawlty Towers, was diagnosed with dementia in 2014.\n\nTimothy also told the magazine: “There’s a lot of time you have to spend making sure Pru knows where she is and where I am. But we share a bed together, we get up, come downstairs, have breakfast and chat.”\n\nBefore going on to say: “Now that her condition has worsened, I miss Pru’s companionship as my best friend.”\n\nDon't miss...\n\nThis Morning star Dr Uchenna Okoye's cause of death confirmed [UPDATE]\n\nMelanie Sykes' Keith Lemon complaints 'ignored by TV bosses' [INSIGHT]\n\nAmanda Owen's son in show move without famous family as he joins Helen Skelton [TV]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nTimothy also spoke about how he misses visiting the theatre or concerts with his wife and discussing the performances afterwards, as her condition means she’s often forgotten who she’s seen.\n\nHowever, he confirms the pair are still as happy as ever as he says: “Now we live life to the full but stay very much in the moment. Pru doesn’t have much awareness of time so when she joins me in the living room, her face lights up as if we’ve been apart for days. The look on her face makes me realise how much I love her.”\n\nTimothy and Prunella married in 1963 after meeting on the set of a TV costume drama. The couple share two sons Sam West who is an actor, and Joseph West, a translator.\n\nPrunella continued to work after her diagnosis, hosting the Channel 4 TV show, Great Canal Journeys, with her husband. She appeared in over 30 episodes of the show, which ran for 12 seasons over seven years.\n\nIn 2020, they were forced to quit the show due to her ailing health, with Celebrity Gogglebox duo Gyles Brandreth and Sheila Hancock taking over.\n\nYou can read the full interview with Timothy West on Saga Exceptional."
