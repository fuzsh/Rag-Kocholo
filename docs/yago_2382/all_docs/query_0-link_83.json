        "text": "Fawlty Towers star Prunella Scales has quit presenting Great Canal Journeys alongside her husband Timothy West amid her ongoing battle with Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe 87-year-old and Timothy, 85, filmed their final episode for Channel 4 in 2019 and will be replaced by Shelia Hancock and Gyles Brandeth who proved popular as a duo on Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\n‘It’s not a decision Pru and Tim have taken lightly but they’re delighted it’s Gyles and Sheila,’ a source told The Sun.\n\nPrunella became a national treasure as the long-suffering wife of Basil Fawlty (John Cleese), Sybil, in Britain’s beloved comedy Fawlty Towers.\n\nIn a statement, the couple wished their successors nothing but the best.\n\n‘Good luck Gyles and Sheila. Enjoy the countryside and the pubs,’ they enthused.\n\nPrunella and former EastEnders actor Timothy first began their canal journey adventure in 2014 and have since explored Europe, India and Egypt in narrowboats.\n\nPrunella’s husband of almost six decades, Timothy will, however, pass the mantle over to Shelia and Gyles during their first episode expected to air later this year.\n\nThe actress first opened up about her memory loss in 2013, revealing she forgot the year she married her husband, which was 1963.\n\nTim later explained to The Independent: ‘The sad thing is that you just watch the gradual disappearance of the person you knew and loved and were very close to.\n\n‘If you live day to day it is manageable.\n\n‘It is when you start thinking of the past and you think, “Oh what a shame she can’t do that anymore”, or you can’t talk about this anymore. Then it is sad.’\n\nMetro.co.uk have reached out to Prunella and Timothy’s representatives for comment as well as Channel 4.\n\nGreat Canal Journeys is expected to return to Channel 4 later this year.\n\nMORE : Timothy West speaking openly about wife Prunella Scales’ dementia is heartbreaking"
