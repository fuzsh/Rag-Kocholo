        "text": "Description\n\nPre-order the paperback now and discover the heartwarming, first-hand account of one of the most celebrated partnerships in the history of British entertainment, the 60-year marriage of Timothy West and Prunella Scales\n\n__________\n\nTimothy West and Prunella Scales are – first and foremost – actors. Over seventy years they have delighted millions, portraying a host of larger-than-life characters that the nation has taken to our hearts.\n\nBut their finest roles, it turns out, have always been as husband and wife – in the extraordinary and enduring double act that is Tim and Pru.\n\nIn Pru and Me, Timothy West charts the course of their lives, from the years before they met – treading the boards in the 50s – to their secret courting, marriage and settling in Wandsworth. And then together as they established themselves at the heart of British theatre, television and film over the next seventy years, in some of the nation’s favourite shows, such as Fawlty Towers and Brass.\n\nCrammed full of stories which are funny, poignant, jaw-dropping and occasionally painful, Pru and Me also vividly recounts the late blaze of glory that introduced the world to the real Tim and Pru, via Great Canal Journeys. Here, the couple charmed the nation while at the same time charting Pru’s gentle struggle with dementia."
