        "text": "Timothy West has given an update on his wife Prunella Scales' dementia diagnosis as he admits it \"Isn't going to get better\".\n\nBBC Breakfast visited the couple at their home to discuss their careers and a long-running relationship with one another.\n\nThe pair have been together for 60 years, which left Timothy to admit: \"It hasn't really been hard work has it?\"\n\nPrunella fiercely agreed and said: \"No, he is the person I love and I enjoy being with...\" to which he quipped: \"That is about it I think!\"\n\nThinking back to when he first noticed something was wrong with Prunella, Timothy explained: \"I came to see a play that Pru was doing in Greenwich.\n\n\"I went to see the first night and it was good, much enjoyed by the audience and then I went to see it again and I thought 'She's not totally with it'.\n\n\"We went to see a specialist and he said I am sorry this is just something that happens to you when you get older. It is not going to get any easier but we cope with it and we manage.\"\n\nThe pair also discussed whether their relationship had changed over the years and since she received her diagnosis.\n\nTimothy exclaimed: \"I don't think it has changed at all...\" to which Prunella agreed and added: \"I have got to know him better and better and better.\"\n\nHe added: \"I know that things are going to change a little bit, but it has been a long time and we have managed pretty well really. I don't think we ever think 'Oh no'.\"\n\nPrunella exclaimed: \"I have been asked to live the rest of my life with somebody I respect very much and agree with a lot of things and argue with about a lot of things quite happily.\"\n\nTimothy and Prunella first met during a play they were both starring in, but have always claimed it was a \"terrible\" one.\n\nAfter falling in love, the pair would exchange two to three letters a day to keep in contact with one another.\n\nPrunella praised: \"He writes lovely letters, marvellous letters.\"\n\nBBC Breakfast airs everyday from 6am on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."
