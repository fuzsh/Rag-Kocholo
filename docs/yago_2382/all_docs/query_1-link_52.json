        "text": "Timothy West and Prunella Scales are first and foremost actors. Over seventy years they have delighted millions, portraying a host of larger-than-life characters that the nation has taken into their hearts. But their finest roles, it turns out, have always been as husband and wife in the extraordinary and enduring double act that is Tim and Pru.\n\nIn Pru & Me, Timothy West charts the course of their lives, from the years before they met treading the boards in the 50s to their secret courting, marriage and settling in Wandsworth. And then together as they established themselves at the heart of British theatre, television and film over the next seventy years, in some of the nation's favourite shows, such as Fawlty Towers and Brass. Crammed full of stories, often funny, sometimes poignant and occasionally jaw-dropping, Pru & Me also vividly recounts the late blaze of glory that introduced the world to the real Tim and Pru via Great Canal Journeys.\n\nHere, the couple charmed the nation while at the same time charting Pru's gentle struggle with dementia. An honest, charming and above all uplifting story of twin souls who, once they found one another, clung together through thick and thin. Pru & Me is a joyous portrait of a very, very special love story.\n\nAuthor(s): West, Timothy,\n\nBinding: Hardback,\n\nDate of Publication: 28/09/2023,\n\nPagination: 352 pages,\n\nSeries: N/A,\n\nImprint: Michael Joseph Ltd,\n\nPublished By: Penguin Books Ltd,\n\nBook Classification: Biography & True Stories,\n\nISBN13\\EAN\\SKU: 9780241629550"
