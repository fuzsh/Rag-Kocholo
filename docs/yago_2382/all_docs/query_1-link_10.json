        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe actress was diagnosed with the condition in 2014, but Timothy had noticed signs as far back as 2001, during the opening night of a theatre production. Although the show went smoothly, the former EastEnders actor observed that Prunella seemed \"a bit strange\" and \"not totally with it\" during that time.\n\nTimothy West has said that things won't get better for his wife Prunella Scales following her dementia diagnosis.\n\nThe actress received a diagnosis of the condition in 2014, but Timothy had observed signs as early as 2001, during the opening night of a theatre production. Despite the show proceeding flawlessly, the former EastEnders actor noted that he found Prunella \"a bit strange\" and \"not totally with it\" at the time.\n\nWith a partnership spanning 60 years, the 89-year-old Not Going Out actor opened up about their future and Prunella's condition in a rare interview, acknowledging that it \"isn't going to get better.\"\n\n\"It hasn't really been hard work has it?,\" he said, as his 91-year-old wife added: \"No, he is the person I love and I enjoy being with...\" to which West replied: \"That is about it I think!\" Discussing first noticing his wife's deterioration, he said: \"I came to see a play that Pru was doing in Greenwich.\n\n\"I went to see the first night and it was good, much enjoyed by the audience and then I went to see it again and I thought 'She's not totally with it'. We went to see a specialist and he said I am sorry this is just something that happens to you when you get older. It is not going to get any easier but we cope with it and we manage.\"\n\nWest doesn't believe their relationship has changed since his wife's dementia diagnosed, as she said: \"I have got to know him better and better and better.\" Timothy added: \"I know that things are going to change a little bit, but it has been a long time and we have managed pretty well really. I don't think we ever think 'Oh no'.\"\n\nPrunella added: \"I have been asked to live the rest of my life with somebody I respect very much and agree with a lot of things and argue with about a lot of things quite happily.\" During a chat with the BBC ahead of the release of his upcoming book, Timothy was asked about Prunella's vascular dementia diagnosis and admits that \"somehow\" they have \"coped\", before adding: \"Pru doesn't really think about it.\"\n\n\"What about?,\" he inquired before Timothy clarified that Prunella doesn't dwell on her condition. \"Well I think elderly people get it anyway, don't they?\" she asked.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
