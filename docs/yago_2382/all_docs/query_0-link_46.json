They seem to go well.'\n\nTimothy, who says he first noticed changes in his wife, 91, in 2001, says that the condition is now 'part of their lives' as they adapt to accomodate her needs.\n\nTimothy insists that the couple are 'coping' with Prunella's dementia and receive help in the form of a carer, from Zimbabwe, called Catherine.\n\nPrunella, best known for playing Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, ended her 67-year acting career in early 2020 following her diagnosis.\n\nPrunella and Timothy were forced to quit their Channel 4 TV show, Great Canal Journeys due to her ailing health in January 2020."
