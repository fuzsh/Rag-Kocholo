        "text": "Give a heartwarming and cosy tale in this first-hand account of one of the most celebrated partnerships in the history of British entertainment, the 60-year marriage of Timothy West and Prunella Scales 'Heartening and heartfelt' The Times, Books of the Year 2023 'Deeply moving, poignant and enthralling' Mail on Sunday __________ Timothy West and Prunella Scales are – first and foremost – actors. Over seventy years they have delighted millions, portraying a host of larger-than-life characters that the nation has taken into their hearts. But their finest roles, it turns out, have always been as husband and wife – in the extraordinary and enduring double act that is Tim and Pru. In Pru & Me, Timothy West charts the course of their lives, from the years before they met – treading the boards in the 50s – to their secret courting, marriage and settling in Wandsworth. And then together as they established themselves at the heart of British theatre, television and film over the next seventy years, in some of the nation’s favourite shows, such as Fawlty Towers and Brass. Crammed full of stories, often funny, sometimes poignant and occasionally jaw-dropping, Pru & Me also vividly recounts the late blaze of glory that introduced the world to the real Tim and Pru via Great Canal Journeys. Here, the couple charmed the nation while at the same time charting Pru’s gentle struggle with dementia. An honest, charming and above all uplifting story of twin souls who, once they found one another, clung together through thick and thin. Pru & Me is a joyous portrait of a very, very special love story. __________ 'A joyous portrait of a unique partnership — uplifting, highly moving and packed with stories of the highs and lows of showbusiness, from what happened when Fawlty’s Sybil appeared nude to how he saw off his love rival Peter Sellers. But above all, it really is a love story like few others. Riveting' Daily Mail 'A beautiful, witty, moving and joyful portrait of marriage' Red 'A memoir laden with laughter and love' Daily Mail"
