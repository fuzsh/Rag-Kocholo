        "text": "If they can afford to pay for 24 hour nursing care involving at least two people and get the adaptations to the house that will be needed then they should be able to remain in their home.\n\nLots of people don’t realise that nearly all dementia patients who live to the advanced stages of the disease end up in care homes - most of them because families simply cannot afford the enormous cost of replicating that level of care at home.\n\nThe other thing is the layout of the West’s house may be too dangerous for her to remain there - lots of stairs and fall hazards.\n\nLooking after someone in the advanced stages of dementia is like caring for a toddler with simply no sense of danger nor understanding of even the most obvious of hazards. They have to be watched all the time. And it is so much worse in a big, old, house with stairs and numerous other potential issues.\n\nI know because I cared for my Mum at home until it became absolutely impossible to continue to do so. Fortunately we found a fabulous care home where I visited her every day. And she was very content there - the only other home she could remember living in was the one from her childhood over 80 years ago.\n\nIt’s a truly horrible illness.\n\n3\n\nWell, I'll say that for Tim....he's stayed faithful to the 'in sickness and in health' part of his vows. Prunella has probably stayed as 'well' and as active as she has because of his care for her but it's clearly getting tougher by the day. I know they've been able to afford it but they've done incredibly well to keep the quality in their lives.\n\n4"
