        "text": "Timothy West has told how wife Prunella Scales is living life to the fullest while battling dementia - including a lavish 90th birthday party and going Greek island-hopping.\n\nThe couple have plenty to celebrate as Prunella turned 90 earlier this year - in which they had a swanky bash for 150 guests - and next year marks their 60th wedding anniversary\n\nPrunella, who starred as Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2014, which devastatingly put an end to her 67-year acting career.\n\nBut her devotes husband Timothy says her spirit has not waned.\n\n“She enjoys life, which is essential really,” he says. “She likes doing things.\n\n“We’ve just been on a little boat trip around the Greek islands - it was just us enjoying ourselves with no cameras.”\n\nThe couple - who have two sons together - have previously filmed their stunning river boat cruises for Channel 4 ’s Grand Canal Journeys, but Prunella, who turned 90 in June, had to quit filming in 2020 when she became ill.\n\nSpeaking about their celebrity filled bash this summer, Timothy continues: “We had a party - quite a big party. About 150 people came.\n\n“I’ve been looking at a book of photographs that were put together by my son.\n\n“I’m ashamed to say I don’t know who they are - I’m sure they’re terribly famous and wonderful.”\n\nSpeaking during a rare appearance for the couple at the Oldie of the Year Awards, at London’s National Liberal Club, Timothy spoke of continuing working into his late 80s, and has recently been collaborating on a new film project with his son Sam.\n\n“I’ve been doing a strange film which we made in Amsterdam,” he says. “I’ve just been over to see that. It’s about ageing, trying to cope with things.\n\n“I’m doing it on film and Sam my elder son is on stage doing the dialogue.\"\n\nThe role has plenty of depth, which Timothy notes can be lacking in older characters depicted in a lot of film and TV projects.\n\n“I think there is a feeling that once you get to a certain age you’re given a slot,” he explains. “This is what we expect and this is what we know is going to happen. It’s not true of course.\n\n“We know some wonderful people who are much older than we are.”\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
