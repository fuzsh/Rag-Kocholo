        "text": "I knew Prunella Scales first as the acidic Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers (1975-9), and any time I encounter the herb “basil,” I am compelled to screech “BAAAASIIIL” like her character. I also love her name, it seems so quintessentially English. Then I noticed she was in frock flicks like Mapp & Lucia and my beloved Howards End. Plus she’s married to actor Timothy West, and their son Samuel West is quite the frock flicker too. I recently watched the series Great Canal Journeys that Prunella and Timothy did, exploring mostly English canals. When that show started, they announced that Prunella Scales was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. She continued to work up until January 2020, and is now surrounded by family, even enjoying All Creatures Great and Small with her son. She’s given me decades of laughter and beautiful performances, so here’s my toast to such a great lady!\n\nLydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (1952)\n\nVicky Hobson in Hobson’s Choice (1954)\n\nMrs. Sandman in The Littlest Horse Thieves (1976)\n\nMistress Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1982)\n\nLady Kingsclere in The Wicked Lady (1983)\n\nMiss Elizabeth Mapp in Mapp & Lucia (1985)\n\nMoira O’Neill in The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987)\n\nAnnie Parker in When We Are Married (1987)\n\nH.M.Q. in “A Question of Attribution,” Screen One (1991)\n\nAunt Juley in Howards End (1992)\n\nSara Turing in Breaking the Code (1996)\n\nMiss Bates in Emma (1996)\n\nAunt Agnes in Stiff Upper Lips (1997)\n\nQueen Victoria in Looking for Victoria (2003)\n\nWhat’s your favorite historical costume movie or TV role by Prunella Scales?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMore Frock Flicks"
