        "text": "So do we then decide that no one wants to see how embarrasing it is to live to live with a dementia sufferer, or is it a way to show that someone with all the problems of dementia can still enjoy life and so can their carer?\n\nThis needs to be thought about. How about not showing anyone with a disability say Downs syndrome. This could, at the extreme end up with people feeling embarrased to see \"those sort of people\" out in public.\n\nIf a person is unable to give permission for filming and what is being filmed is something which that person would, prior to their illness, be unlikely to want filmed, (e.g. being bathed or receiving personal care), then I think that is wrong.\n\nI haven't watched the canal journey programme but have seen clips of it. It doesn't seem to me to be unduly intrusive and I'm sure Prunella Scales' husband wouldn't agree to it if it were.\n\nIt seems to me that if we never see elderly people in the media, even if they are a little \"dishevelled\", then that is making ageing something slightly shameful that must be hidden away. The same could be said for people with mental and/or physical disabilities who look a bit different.\n\nIf we want to be remembered as we were in our youth, then we would have to hide away at home.\n\nI watch these programmes and Prunella Scales seems perfectly fine to me. The only problem seems to be that Timothy keeps saying 'Pru isn't what she was' or such like. She was reciting poetry and Shakespeare on the Venice one and she was great. He obviously cares very much for her but I sometimes feel like shouting at the TV 'stop harping on about it'.\n\nI think the way she gets on with some of the stuff he expects her to do is amazing, however, I don't think Timothy West should be allowed to take out those larger narrow boats because he's dreadful at steering!\n\nI also think that Pru is quite proud of herself, and well done to them both for getting the trips on tv, I love them.\n\nDementia is not necessarily a 24/7 out of it situation. Many people for a long time drift into hours of dementia and hours of being themselves when they can make informed choices.\n\nPrunella Scales has given interviews since her dementia was diagnosed where she sounds rational and completely with it. I suspect she is still in that stage of dementia so is quite capable of giving consent and fully understanding exactly what she is doing in this series - earning a living by entertaining the public, which is what she has done all her life.\n\nPersonally I think she is a delight, she is showing that dementia doesn't mean an end to normal living that even with a mental impairment you can still continue to enjoy life. This I am sure is an eye opener to many people, both those with dementia or feeling it breathing down their back and those too young to fear it.\n\nShe has aged so well, remained so slim and fit and always looks so much younger and fresher than Joan Collins, the other thespian, still regularly in the news (apart from Judy Dench who is in a class of her own)\n\nWould those who object also object to someone with another disabling condition?\n\nI have chosen the expression 'disabling condition' carefully to mean anything that hinders a person's ability to do stuff they used to do with ease or a condition that limits them physically or mentally in any way. It covers a very broad spectrum from having a temporary illness or a broken limb, for instance that disables someone for a relatively short time to a disability that someone has had since birth and which is usually \"obvious\" to someone else, and of course it covers all the disabilities that no-one else can see, which are very common.\n\nAnd I ask because I think one can look at dementia as a disabling state to be in, intermittent at first perhaps but then permanent.\n\nI think it's a good idea for everyone to see how people with disabling conditions, including dementia, live and manage their lives.\n\nWhy would someone who's had a long successful career object to being remembered as having dementia as they got older? What is there to mind about \"being remembered in that way\"? It's an terminal (in the sense that people don't seem to recover from it, not that it actually kills them) illness. That's all.\n\nWhen I was a child I live a street away from a house where a person was kept indoors , no one was invited in, my g grandfather who was their minister was allowed to visit several times a week. The person was a downs child, thrn grew into s downs man as they do. In my g grandfathers journals I read his opinion of this persons home life, only child, deeply loved, parents fearful he would say or do something he shouldn't and be taken from them . I hope Pru keeps enjoying her canal adventures, she looks so happy as does Tim, why should he keep her out of sight, why shouldn't he speak of her dementia , if she had an accident and was confined to a wheelchair it would be acceptable for him to speak of this.\n\nI love their adventures and am in awe of their energy\n\nI think she seems to be able to say if she didn't like being filmed, although I do get fed up with TW 'going on' about it. Similarly I remember a stage show he was in when he said she was in the audience \"again\" but \"that doesn't matter, because she won't remember any of it.\" She was there and I felt humiliated on her behalf. Filming is a bit different, because I'm assuming she sees it before it goes out and is able to consent. If she wasn't, then there would be Safeguarding issues and, hopefully, her GP or whoever is responsible for her care, would say something.\n\nI watched the last programme and thought the way Timothy West looked after his wife was very touching. I enjoyed seeing them and while she can contribute to life and living, I see no reason why she can't be on T.V. I was particularly touched when she said, at the end of the programme, that she would go anywhere, as long as it was with him. Lovely couple!"
