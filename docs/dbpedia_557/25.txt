While Muhammad Ali has been the subject of countless articles and books written by sports historians and journalists, rhetorical scholars have largely ignored him.

Full Text Available O estudo analisa a carreira do boxeador Muhammad Ali segundo as formulaÃ§Ãµes sobre as relaÃ§Ãµes de poder em configuraÃ§Ãµes apresentadas por Norbert Elias. O propÃ³sito foi compreender como um atleta que foi contra questÃµes tÃ£o profundas da sociedade estabelecida obteve sucesso profissional. Tratou-se de um estudo documental, tendo como fonte livros, artigos e reportagens publicadas sobre a trajetÃ³ria do lutador. Concluiu-se que apesar de Ali ter se posicionado contra padrÃµes estabelecidos de sua Ã©poca em questÃµes como a religiÃ£o, o racismo e o patriotismo, a sua habilidade tÃ©cnica acima da mÃ©dia, o seu poder de autopromoÃ§Ã£o e a sua capacidade de participar do jogo no contexto configuracional de que fazia parte, lhe deram condiÃ§Ãµes de sobrevivÃªncia no mundo do boxe e conseqÃ¼ente sucesso profissional.

Full Text Available This article explores the significance of the Muhammad Ali Center as a site where meanings associated with âraceâ and âreligionâ are constructed, contested and potentially transformed. The Muhammad Ali Center is examined as an example of an increasing number of cultural institutions (i.e., cultural centers, museums, arts spaces etc. engaged in the strategic re-presentation of issues of cultural difference and socio-political conflict, towards the ends of promoting social justice and/or human rights. The article draws upon theories and methods in cultural studies, religious studies, and museums studies in order to explore the significance of the representational and curatorial strategies of such cultural institutions for understanding alternative approaches to influencing and/or intervening in public discourses and practices surrounding issues of racial injustice and religious intolerance.

Greater self-enhancement in Western than Eastern Ukraine, but failure to replicate the Muhammad Ali effect.

Kemmelmeier, Markus; Malanchuk, Oksana

2016-02-01

Based on the cross-cultural research linking individualism-collectivism and self-enhancement, this research examines regional pattern of self-enhancement in Ukraine. Broadly speaking, the western part of Ukraine is mainly Ukrainian speaking and historically oriented towards Europe, whereas Eastern Ukraine is mainly Russian speaking and historically oriented towards the Russian cultural sphere. We found self-enhancement on a "better than average" task to be higher in a Western Ukrainian sample compared to an Eastern Ukrainian sample, with differences in independent self-construals supporting assumed regional variation in individualism. However, the Muhammad Ali effect, the finding that self-enhancement is greater in the domain of morality than intelligence, was not replicated. The discussion focuses on the specific sources of this regional difference in self-enhancement, and reasons for why the Muhammad Ali effect was not found.

The similarity of Ali (as and Jesus (PBUH in Islamic tradition

Full Text Available According to the teachings of the Shia, Imam Ali (AS has unique features by which he earned the merits of becoming the successor to the Prophet (pbuh as the Imam and Wali. One of the most important of his features is his similarity to the Jesus as one of the greatest prophets before Prophet Muhammad (pbuh. This similarity was first mentioned in some Islamic traditions, especially the ones narrated through Shiite Isnad in interpretation of the verses 57-59 of the Surta Az-Zukhruf. In these traditions, the Prophet has regarded the Position of Imam Ali (AS in his nation the same as Jesus's Position among the Israel. The Quran has cited the inimical arguments of the Arab infidels against this prophet's saying: they considered the worshiping of their own gods better than accepting Prophet's remark in equating his cousin with Jesus (pbuh. By resorting to this remark, the infidels regarded worshiping their own gods more preferable than deifying a man. Therefore, the first and most prominent similarity between Imam Ali (AS and Jesus Christ (pbuh is attributing divinity to Imam Ali (AS, at least by some of his extreme lovers. The Quranic command saying: "Do not Exaggerate about your religionâ¦ .(Quran 4:17 refers to the Christian extremism in deifying Jesus, But soon word Ghali was borrowed from this verse and used to refer to Shiite extremists. Moreover, the Quran (4: 159, talks about the advent of Jesus Christ to his followers before their death .The same concept has been mentioned in Shiite traditions about Imam Ali (AS, according to which, he is believed to be present beside every dying Muslim individual. This appearance of Imam Ali (AS would remind us the idea of Imam Ali's (AS return to this world. Thus, the return of Imam Ali (AS to this world is the third similarity between Imam Ali (AS and Jesus Christ (PBUH.

Full Text Available Los grandes genios religiosos son JesÃºs, Buda y Muhammad. Ni JesÃºs ni Muhammad quisieron crear una religiÃ³n, sino corregir la primitiva revelaciÃ³n, que se habÃ­a desviado. Muhammad ha creado una religiosidad que ha dado alimento espiritual durante muchos siglos a millones de fieles, y una mÃ­stica fabulosa que ha durado mÃ¡s de 1.000 aÃ±os. Tor Andrae seÃ±ala influjos de la iglesia y del monacato sirio. D.J. Sahas indica influjo fuerte del monacato sirio en el CorÃ¡n. Se comparan en este trabajo puntos fundamentales de la religiosidad del CorÃ¡n con el del monacato palestino: infierno, Juicio Final, DemonologÃ­a, AngeologÃ­a, el ParaÃ­so, OraciÃ³n, Ayunos, Limosna, prohibiciÃ³n de alimento, EucaristÃ­a, etc. Muhammad es un hereje cristiano para S. Juan Damasceno, que viviÃ³ muchos aÃ±os en la corte de los Omeyas y desempeÃ±Ã³ altos cargos. Muhammad admite que Cristo es el MesÃ­as, un grandÃ­simo profeta, la palabra de Dios y el enviado de Dios. Niega que sea Dios, ni la redenciÃ³n, ni la crucifixiÃ³n, que es sÃ³lo aparente; acepta la resurrecciÃ³n y la subida a los cielos. No admite la Trinidad. Los grandes investigadores protestantes, Harnack, Schlatter, Wellhausen, en el siglo XX, afirman que era un ebionita, o sea, un judeo-cristiano heterodoxo, que vivÃ­an en Palestina y Siria, tesis que aceptÃ³ el gran teÃ³logo catÃ³lico H. KÃ¼ng, partidario de un diÃ¡logo con el Islam. Muhammad llevÃ³, al principio, una vida en la montaÃ±a, muy parecida a la de los monjes cristianos. En el arte musulmÃ¡n hay pinturas que representan a Muhammad con monjes que Ã©l conocÃ­a de sus viajes a Siria. No se puede dudar de un fuerte influjo del monacato palestino y sirio en la religiosidad de Muhammad, como indica D.J. Sahas, excelente conocedor de S. Juan Damasceno.

Full Text Available Shaykh Muhammad Rif`at is one of the famous reciters in Egypt in the era of the 90's. His stature continues evident after officially been invited as a qari to the opening ceremony of Qari al-Misriyyah Idha`at in 1934. During his involvement in the world of Quranic recitation, Shaykh Muhammad Rif`at had recited the Quran in the mosque of Fadil Basha for 25 years. His determinations to deliver and spread Holy Quran with an intermediate reading in mosques, haflah-haflah and maâtam also have strongly influenced the next generations of qurraâ. Many of the reciters like Shaykh Mustafa Isma`il, Shaykh Abu al-`Aynin Sha`isha', Shaykh `Abdul Fattah and others recognize that he has the greatness and uniqueness of its own in the art of reading the Quran. This is evidenced by some of the titles given to him as Amir al-Qurraâ, Qitharah al-Samaâ and Sawt al-Malaikah by his contemporary reciters. After Shaykh Muhammad Rif`at died in 1950, then relics of his recited turath were uncovered which compiled by his friend, Zakaria Basha and compatriot Muhammad Khamis, as they managed to gather a total of 278 cds contains 19 chapters with the duration of 21 hours.

Full Text Available In 1976, Kaplansky introduced the class JB*-algebras which includes all C*-algebras as a proper subclass. The notion of topological stable rank 1 for C*-algebras was originally introduced by M. A. Rieffel and was extensively studied by various authors. In this paper, we extend this notion to general JB*-algebras. We show that the complex spin factors are of tsr 1 providing an example of special JBW*-algebras for which the enveloping von Neumann algebras may not be of tsr 1. In the sequel, we prove that every invertible element of a JB*-algebra is positive in certain isotope of ; if the algebra is finite-dimensional, then it is of tsr 1 and every element of is positive in some unitary isotope of . Further, it is established that extreme points of the unit ball sufficiently close to invertible elements in a JB*-algebra must be unitaries and that in any JB*-algebras of tsr 1, all extreme points of the unit ball are unitaries. In the end, we prove the coincidence between the Î»-function and Î»u-function on invertibles in a JB*-algebra.

His success in daâwa activities was contributed by his social roles as well as the revelation that he brought. This article tries to explain that both the revelation and the social factors greatly supported his daâwa. Beside his positives, the existence of Quran as a revelation contributed the social legitimacy that Muhammad was considered as a figure to be followed in spite of his contrary values to the cultures of his time.

PERSONALITY EDUCATION ACCORDING TO ALLAMA MUHAMMAD IQBAL

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Imam Bahroni

2015-12-01

Full Text Available Â Â Â Â Â This paper is aimed at discussing the concept of Personality Education according to Allama Muhammad Iqbal. In relation with the concept, Muhammad Iqbal (1873-1938, emphasized the proper development of the individuality of man. He maintained that an individual should be exposed to all kinds of formative and challenging experiences; otherwise his individuality will shrink and wither[1]. Iqbal underscored the importance of freedom, which allowed for experimentation with the environment, for the exercise of choice and discrimination in the use of methods and substance, and for learning by direct, firsthand experience. Despite his emphasis on the individual, Iqbal did not ignore the role of the community and its culture in the give-and-take dynamics with the individual. Iqbal also subscribed to the view that there must be harmony between the material and spiritual elements in man, which educational theory should consider. He valued intellect, but he criticized contemporary thought for overstressing it at the expense of intuition or love. From Iqbal's writings, the characteristics of the good man could be inferred. First, the good man is creative and original, for creativity is the most precious and distinctive gift of man. He must be able to use his intelligence to harness the forces of nature for his own good and also to increase his knowledge and power. Secondly, the good man lives his life in the name of the Lord, dedicating his powers and knowledge to working out His purpose and thereby deserving himself for the position of God's vicegerent on earth.[1] K.G.

Bacillus anthracis is one of the most homogenous bacteria ever described. Some level of diversity. Bacillus anthracis 17JB is a laboratory strain It is broadly used as a challenge strain in guinea pigs for potency test of anthrax vaccine. This work describes genetic characterization of B. anthracis 17 JB strain using the SNPs and MLVA genotyping. In SNPs typing, the originally French 17JB strain represented the A.Br. 008/009 subgroup. In Levy's genotyping method, 843, 451 and 864 bp long fragments were identified at AA03, AJ03 and AA07 loci, respectively. In the vaccine manufacturer perspective these findings are much valuable on their own account, but similar research is required to extend molecular knowledge of B. anthracis epidemiology in Persia.

The ability of Paenibacillus polymyxa to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli generic ATCC 25922 (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) and to adhere to monolayers of the enterocyte-like human cell line Caco-2 was evaluated. P. polymyxa JB-0501 (P. polymyxa JB-0501), found in a livestock feed probiotic supplement, was compared to P. polymyxa reference strain ATCC 43685 and ATCC 7070 (P. polymyxa ATCC) in terms of carbohydrate utilization and resistance to lysozyme, acid, bile salts, and hydrogen peroxide. JB-0501 grew at pH 4.5 and at H2O2 concentrations less than 7.3Â Î¼g/ml and presented a higher affinity to hexadecane and decane. Bile salts at 0.2Â % inhibited the growth of all three strains. P. polymyxa JB-0501 and P. polymyxa ATCC 43865 adhered to Caco-2 cell monolayers. The percentage of cells that adhered ranged from about 0.35 to 6.5Â % and was partially proportional to the number applied. Contact time (from 15Â min to 1Â h) had little impact on adhesion. P. polymyxa JB-0501 inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922, as proven by the diffusion tests in agar. Taken together, these results suggested that P. polymyxa JB-0501 has the potential probiotic properties to justify its consideration as a livestock feed supplement.

ALI is secondary limit. The method of calculating ALI, changes of some parameters used in calculation of ALI and their influences on ALI were discussed. A comparison between old and new ALI was made. The most part of the ratios of old ALI/new ALI (about 75%) ranges from 2 to 4. Reduction of annual dose limit from 50 mSv to 20 mSv seems to be the main reason causing reduction of values of new ALI

1. The histamine H2-receptor antagonistic activity and antisecretory and antiulcer effects of JB-9315 were studied in comparison with the standard H2 blocker ranitidine. 2. In vitro, JB-9315 is a competitive antagonist of histamine H2 receptors in the isolated, spontaneously beating guinea-pig right atrium, with a pA2 value of 7.30 relative to a value of 7.36 for ranitidine. JB-9315 was specific for the histamine H2 receptor because, at high concentration, it did not affect histamine- or acetylcholine-induced contractions in guinea-pig isolated ileum or rat isolated duodenum, respectively. 3. JB-9315 dose dependently inhibited histamine-, pentagastrin- or carbachol-stimulated acid secretion and basal secretion in the perfused stomach preparation of the anesthetized rat. In the pylorus-ligated rat after intraperitoneal administration, total acid output over 4 h was inhibited by JB-9315 with an ID50 of 32.8 mg/kg, confirming its H2-receptor antagonist properties. 4. JB-9315 showed antiulcer activity against cold stress plus indomethacin-induced lesions with an ID50 of 6.8 mg/kg. 5. JB-9315, 50 and 100 mg/kg, inhibited macroscopic gastric hemorrhagic lesions induced by ethanol. In contrast, ranitidine (50 mg/kg) failed to reduce these lesions. 6. These results indicate that JB-9315 is a new antiulcer drug that exerts a cytoprotective effect in addition to its gastric antisecretory activity.

In the fall of 1992, the TAC Team was presented with a Request for Proposal (PFP) for a mid-size (250-350 passenger) commercial transport. The aircraft was to be extremely competitive in the areas of passenger comfort, performance, and economic aspects. Through the use of supercritical airfoils, a technologically advanced Very High By-pass Ratio (VHBR) turbofan engine, a low overall drag configuration, a comparable interior layout, and mild use of composites, the JB-300 offers an economically viable choice to the airlines. The cents per passenger mile of the JB-300 is 1.76, which is considerably lower than current aircraft in the same range. Overall, the JB-300 is a technologically advanced aircraft, which will meet the demands of the 21st century.

AliEn - EDG Interoperability in ALICE

CERN Document Server

Bagnasco, S; Buncic, P; Carminati, F; Cerello, P G; Saiz, P

2003-01-01

AliEn (ALICE Environment) is a GRID-like system for large scale job submission and distributed data management developed and used in the context of ALICE, the CERN LHC heavy-ion experiment. With the aim of exploiting upcoming Grid resources to run AliEn-managed jobs and store the produced data, the problem of AliEn-EDG interoperability was addressed and an in-terface was designed. One or more EDG (European Data Grid) User Interface machines run the AliEn software suite (Cluster Monitor, Storage Element and Computing Element), and act as interface nodes between the systems. An EDG Resource Broker is seen by the AliEn server as a single Computing Element, while the EDG storage is seen by AliEn as a single, large Storage Element; files produced in EDG sites are registered in both the EDG Replica Catalogue and in the AliEn Data Catalogue, thus ensuring accessibility from both worlds. In fact, both registrations are required: the AliEn one is used for the data management, the EDG one to guarantee the integrity and...

Advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI, body mass index [BMI] x serum albumin/neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [NLR]) has been shown to predict overall survival (OS) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). CT enables skeletal muscle to be quantified, whereas BMI cannot accurately reflect body composition. The purpose was to evaluate prognostic value of modified ALI (mALI) using CT-determined L3 muscle index (L3MI, muscle area at L3/height2) beyond original ALI. L3MIs were calculated using the CT images of 186 consecutive patients with SCLC taken at diagnosis, and mALI was defined as L3MI x serum albumin/NLR. Using chi-squared test determined maximum cut-offs for low ALI and low mALI, the prognostic values of low ALI and low mALI were tested using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Finally, deviance statistics was used to test whether the goodness of fit of the prognostic model is improved by adding mALI as an extra variable. Patients with low ALI (cut-off, 31.1, n = 94) had shorter OS than patients with high ALI (median, 6.8 months vs. 15.8 months; p ALI and low mALI (z = 0.000, p = 1.000) and between high ALI and high mALI (z = 0.330, p = 0.740). Multivariable analysis showed that low ALI was an independent prognostic factor for shorter OS (HR, 1.67, p = 0.004), along with advanced age (HR, 1.49, p = 0.045), extensive disease (HR, 2.27, p ALI using BMI. ALI is a simple and useful prognostic indicator in SCLC.

A novel pyridine derivative, 8-{4-[(6-methoxy-2,3-dihydro-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-b]pyridine-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-butyl}-8-aza-spiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione hydrochloride, termed JB-788, was designed to selectively target 5-HT(1A) receptors. In the present study, the pharmacological profile of JB-788 was characterized in vitro using radioligands binding tests and in vivo using neurochemical and behavioural experiments. JB-788 bound tightly to human 5-HT(1A) receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells with a K(i) value of 0.8 nM. Its binding affinity is in the same range as that observed for the (+/-)8-OH-DPAT, a reference 5HT(1A) agonist compound. Notably, JB-788 only bound weakly to 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(2A) receptors and moreover the drug displayed only weak or indetectable binding to muscarinic, alpha(2), beta(1) and beta(2) adrenergic receptors, or dopaminergic D(1) receptors. JB-788 was found to display substantial binding affinity for dopaminergic D(2) receptors and, to a lesser extend to alpha(1) adrenoreceptors. JB-788 dose-dependently decreased forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in HEK cells expressing human 5-HT(1A), thus acting as a potent 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (E(max.) 75%, EC(50) 3.5 nM). JB-788 did not exhibit any D(2) receptor agonism but progressively inhibited the effects of quinpirole, a D(2) receptor agonist, in the cAMP accumulation test with a K(i) value of 250 nM. JB-788 induced a weak change in cAMP levels in mouse brain but, like some antipsychotics, transiently increased glycogen contents in various brain regions. Behavioral effects were investigated in mice using the elevated plus-maze. JB-788 was found to increase the time duration spent by animals in anxiogenic situations. Locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine in mouse, a model of antipsychotic activity, was dose-dependently inhibited by JB-788. Altogether, these results suggest that JB-788 displays pharmacological properties, which could be of interest in the area

1. JB-9322 is a selective histamine H2-receptor antagonist with gastric antisecretory activity and mucosal protective properties. 2. The affinity of JB-9322 for the guinea-pig atria histamine H2-receptor was approximately 2 times greater than that of ranitidine. 3. In vivo, the ID50 value for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats was 5.28 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally. JB-9322 also dose-dependently inhibited gastric juice volume and pepsin secretion. In gastric lumen-perfused rats, intravenous injection of JB-9322 dose-dependently reduced histamine-, pentagastrin- and carbachol-stimulated gastric acid secretion. 4. JB-9322 showed antiulcer activity against aspirin and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions and was more potent than ranitidine. 5. JB-9322 effectively inhibited macroscopic gastric haemorrhagic lesions induced by ethanol. Intraperitoneal injection was effective in preventing the lesions as well as oral treatment. The oral ID50 value for these lesions was 1.33 mg kg-1. By contrast, ranitidine (50 mg kg-1) failed to reduce these lesions. In addition, the protective effect of JB-9322 was independent of prostaglandin synthesis. 6. These results indicate that JB-9322 is a new antiulcer drug that exerts a potent cytoprotective effect in addition to its gastric antisecretory activity.

Comamonas sp. JB was used to investigate the cometabolic degradation of dibenzofuran (DBF) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) with naphthalene as the primary substrate. Dehydrogenase and ATPase activity of the growing system with the presence of DBF and DBT were decreased when compared to only naphthalene in the growing system, indicating that the presence of DBF and DBT inhibited the metabolic activity of strain JB. The pathways and enzymes involved in the cometabolic degradation were tested. Examination of metabolites elucidated that strain JB cometabolically degraded DBF to 1,2-dihydroxydibenzofuran, subsequently to 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxo-3'H-benzofuran-2'-yliden)but-2-enoic acid, and finally to catechol. Meanwhile, strain JB cometabolically degraded DBT to 1,2-dihydroxydibenzothiophene and subsequently to the ring cleavage product. A series of naphthalene-degrading enzymes including naphthalene dioxygenase, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase, salicylate hydroxylase, and catechol 2,3-oxygenase have been detected, confirming that naphthalene was the real inducer of expression the degradation enzymes and metabolic pathways were controlled by naphthalene-degrading enzymes.

Mounting evidence supports the influence of the gut microbiome on the local enteric nervous system and its effects on brain chemistry and relevant behavior. Vagal afferents are involved in some of these effects. We previously showed that ingestion of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) caused extensive neurochemical changes in the brain and behavior that were abrogated by prior vagotomy. Because information can be transmitted to the brain via primary afferents encoded as neuronal spike trains, our goal was to record those induced by JB-1 in vagal afferents in the mesenteric nerve bundle and thus determine the nature of the signals sent to the brain. Male Swiss Webster mice jejunal segments were cannulated ex vivo, and serosal and luminal compartments were perfused separately. Bacteria were added intraluminally. We found no evidence for translocation of labeled bacteria across the epithelium during the experiment. We recorded extracellular multi- and single-unit neuronal activity with glass suction pipettes. Within minutes of application, JB-1 increased the constitutive single- and multiunit firing rate of the mesenteric nerve bundle, but Lactobacillus salivarius (a negative control) or media alone were ineffective. JB-1 significantly augmented multiunit discharge responses to an intraluminal distension pressure of 31 hPa. Prior subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolished all of the JB-1-evoked effects. This detailed exploration of the neuronal spike firing that encodes behavioral signaling to the brain may be useful to identify effective psychoactive bacteria and thereby offer an alternative new perspective in the field of psychiatry and comorbid conditions.

AliEn - GRID application for ALICE Collaboration

AliEn (ALICE Environment) is a GRID framework built on top of the latest Internet standards for information exchange and authentication (SOAP, PKI) and common Open Source components. AliEn provides a virtual file catalogue that allows transparent access to distributed data-sets and a number of collaborating Web services which implement the authentication, job execution, file transport, performance monitor and event logging.The ALICE experiment has developed AliEn as an implementation of distributed computing infrastructure needed to simulate, reconstruct and analyze data from the experiment. The sites that belong to the ALICE Virtual Organisation can be seen and used as a single entity - any available node executes jobs and access to logical and datasets is transparent to the user. In developing AliEn common standards and solutions in the form of Open Source components were used. Only 1% (25k physical lines of code in Perl) is native AliEn code while 99% of the code has been imported in form of Open Sources packages and Perl modules. Currently ALICE is using the system for distributed production of Monte Carlo data at over 30 sites on four continents. During the last twelve months more than 30,000 jobs have been successfully run under AliEn control worldwide, totalling 25 CPU years and producing 20 TB of data. The user interface is compatible to EU DataGrid at the level of authentication and job description language. In perspective AliEn will be interfaced to the mainstream Grid infrastructure in HEP and it will remain to serve as interface between ALICE Offline framework and external Grid infrastructure.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to grow TixAlyN and TixAlyC thin films using trimethylaluminum (TMA), titanium tetrachloride and ammonia as precursors. Deposition temperature was varied between 325 Â°C and 500 Â°C. Films were also annealed in vacuum and N2-atmosphere at 600-1000 Â°C. Wide range of characterization methods was used including time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-ERDA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray reflectometry (XRR), Raman spectroscopy, ellipsometry, helium ion microscopy (HIM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 4-point probe measurement for resistivity. Deposited films were roughly 100 nm thick and contained mainly desired elements. Carbon, chlorine and hydrogen were found to be the main impurities.

Phytoremediation combined with suitable microorganisms and biodegradable chelating agents can be a means of reclaiming lands contaminated by toxic heavy metals. We investigated the ability of a lead- and cadmium-resistant bacterial strain (JB12) and the biodegradable chelator ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) to improve absorption of these metals from soil by tall fescue and red clover. Strain JB12 was isolated from contaminated soil samples, analysed for lead and cadmium resistance, and identified as Burkholderia cepacia. Tall fescue and red clover were grown in pots to which we added JB12, (S,S)-EDDS, combined JB12 and EDDS, or water only. Compared with untreated plants, the biomass of plants treated with JB12 was significantly increased. Concentrations of lead and cadmium in JB12-treated plants increased significantly, with few exceptions. Plants treated with EDDS responded variably, but in those treated with combined EDDS and JB12, heavy metal concentrations increased significantly in tall fescue and in the aboveground parts of red clover. We conclude that JB12 is resistant to lead and cadmium. Its application to the soil improved the net uptake of these heavy metals by experimental plants. The potential for viable phytoremediation of lead- and cadmium-polluted soils with tall fescue and red clover combined with JB12 was further enhanced by the addition of EDDS.

Web Services are an XML based technology that allow applications to communicate with each other across disparate systems. Web Services are becoming the de facto standard that enable inter operability between heterogeneous processes and systems. AliEn2 is a grid environment based on web services. The AliEn2 services can be divided in three categories: Central services, deployed once per organization; Site services, deployed on each of the participating centers; Job Agents running on the worker nodes automatically. A security model to protect these services is essential for the whole system. Current implementations of web server, such as Apache, are not suitable to be used within the grid environment. Apache with the mod s sl and OpenSSL only supports the X.509 certificates. But in the grid environment, the common credential is the proxy certificate for the purpose of providing restricted proxy and delegation. An Authentication framework was taken for AliEn2 web services to add the ability to accept X.509 certificates and proxy certificates from client-side to Apache Web Server. The authentication framework could also allow the generation of access control policies to limit access to the AliEn2 web services.

To compare the changes in the insulin reaction of Holstein dairy cows and Japanese Black cows (JB) during the periparturient period, the insulin resistance test in vivo and lymphocytes proliferation with insulin in vitro were performed. Ten healthy Holstein dairy cows (Holstein group) and 10 healthy JB cows (JB group) used in this study were observed on days 60, 40, and 20 before calving and days 7 and 20 after calving. In insulin resistance reaction in vivo and in vitro, a low insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate and lymphocyte proliferation with insulin were observed in the Holstein group compared with the JB group during the experimental period. An analysis of the lymphocytes cultured with insulin showed that the percentage of CD4+CD45R- T cells in the Holstein group was significantly lower than that of the JB group before day 20. These findings indicate that T cells reaction to insulin in healthy periparturient Holstein cows is lower than that in Japanese Black.

Full Text Available Abstract Background Sesquiterpene lactones (SL are plant secondary metabolites that are known for their anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. Considering that several SL-derived drugs are currently in cancer clinical trials, we have tested two SL molecules, 3-Î²-methoxy-iso-seco-tanapartholide (Î²-tan isolated from Achillea falcata and salograviolide A (Sal A isolated from Centaurea ainetensis, for their anti-tumor properties. We used the mouse epidermal JB6Pâ+âcells as a model for tumor promotion and cellular transformation. Key players that are involved in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis are the AP-1 and NF-ÎºB transcription factors; therefore, we assessed how Î²-tan and Sal A modulate their signaling pathways in JB6Pâ+âcells. Methods The effects of Î²-tan and Sal A on the growth of normal and neoplastic keratinocytes and on the tumor promotion-responsive JB6Pâ+âcells were determined using the MTT assay. Anchorage-independent cell growth transformation assays were used to evaluate the anti-tumor promoting properties of these SL molecules in JB6Pâ+âcells and dual luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis were used to investigate their effects on tumor promoter-induced AP-1 and NF-ÎºB activities and protein levels of key AP-1 and NF-ÐºB target genes. Results Î²-tan and Sal A selectively inhibited tumor promoter-induced cell growth and transformation of JB6Pâ+âcells at concentrations that do not affect JB6Pâ+âand primary keratinocytes basal cell growth. In addition, both molecules reduced basal and tumor promoter-induced NF-ÎºB transcriptional activities, differentially regulated basal and tumor promoter-induced AP-1 transcriptional activities, and modulated key players of the AP-1 and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways.

Loss of retrovirus production in JB/RH melanoma cells transfected with H-2Kb and TAP-1 genes.

JB/RH1 melanoma cells, as well as other melanomas of C57BL/6 mice (B16 and JB/MS), express a common melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) encoded by an ecotropic melanoma-associated retrovirus (MelARV). JB/RH1 cells do not express the H-2Kb molecules due to down-regulation of the H-2Kb and TAP-1 genes. When JB/RH1 cells were transfected with the H-2Kb and cotransfected with the TAP-1 gene, it resulted in the appearance of H-2Kb molecules and an increase in their immunogenicity, albeit they lost expression of retrovirus-encoded MAA recognized by MM2-9B6 mAb. Loss of MAA was found to result from a complete and stable elimination of ecotropic MelARV production in the H-2Kb/TAP-1-transfected JB/RH1 cells. Northern blot analysis showed no differences in ecotropic retroviral messages in MelARV-producing and -nonproducing melanoma cells, suggesting that loss of MelARV production was not due to down-regulation of MelARV transcription. Southern blot analysis revealed several rearrangements in the proviral DNA of H-2Kb-positive JB/RH1 melanoma cells. Sequence analysis of the ecotropic proviral DNA from these cells showed numerous nucleotide substitutions, some of which resulted in the appearance of a novel intraviral PstI restriction site and the loss of a HindIII restriction site in the pol region. PCR amplification of the proviral DNAs indicates that an ecotropic provirus found in the H-2Kb-positive cells is novel and does not preexist in the parental H-2Kb-negative melanoma cells. Conversely, the ecotropic provirus of the parental JB/RH1 cells was not amplifable from the H-2Kb-positive cells. Our data indicate that stable loss of retroviral production in the H-2Kb/TAP-1-transfected melanoma cells is probably due to the induction of recombination between a productive ecotropic MelARV and a defective nonecotropic provirus leading to the generation of a defective ecotropic provirus and the loss of MelARV production and expression of the retrovirus-encoded MAA.

Malaria is a serious disease, caused by the parasite of the genus Plasmodium , which was responsible for 440,000 deaths in 2015. Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is one of the main clinical complications in severe malaria. The murine model DBA/2 reproduces the clinical signs of ALI/ARDS in humans, when infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. High levels of HO-1 were reported in cases of severe malaria. Our data indicated that the HO-1 mRNA and protein expression are increased in mice that develop malaria-associated ALI/ARDS (MA-ALI/ARDS). Additionally, the hemin, a HO-1 inducing drug, prevented mice from developing MA-ALI/ARDS when administered prior to the development of MA-ALI/ARDS in this model. Also, hemin treatment showed an amelioration of respiratory parameters in mice, high VEGF levels in the sera, and a decrease in vascular permeability in the lung, which are signs of ALI/ARDS. Therefore, the induction of HO-1 before the development of MA-ALI/ARDS could be protective. However, the increased expression of HO-1 on the onset of MA-ALI/ARDS development may represent an effort to revert the phenotype of this syndrome by the host. We therefore confirm that HO-1 inducing drugs could be used for prevention of MA-ALI/ARDS in humans.

Histological techniques are critical for observing tissue and cellular morphology. In this paper, we outline our protocol for embedding, serial sectioning, staining and visualizing zebrafish embryos embedded in JB-4 plastic resin-a glycol methacrylate-based medium that results in excellent preservation of tissue morphology. In addition, we describe our procedures for staining plastic sections with toluidine blue or hematoxylin and eosin, and show how to couple these stains with whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. We also describe how to maintain and visualize immunofluorescence and EGFP signals in JB-4 resin. The protocol we outline-from embryo preparation, embedding, sectioning and staining to visualization-can be accomplished in 3 d. Overall, we reinforce that plastic embedding can provide higher resolution of cellular details and is a valuable tool for cellular and morphological studies in zebrafish.

Therefore, among the scholars at the same time Muslim intellectuals in the Islamic world when it started thinking to bounce back and catch up with the Islamic world experienced such a variety of ways that may be carried out according to the conditions at that time. Among them was Sheikh Muhammad Abduh. In the course of his life, Abduh has done ijtihad and renewal through the various ideas put forward ideas or even gets serious challenges from various parties, including the scholars of al-Azhar itself. But all of that does not make him despair and retreat, so that his ideas had a great influence for the next generation. Abduh brilliant ideas include the fields of education, legal, social, administrative, political and others. This article only focuses his discussion on his thoughts about education which would still be relevant to observe in order to be an afterthought for students of education in this country. Abduh's ideas include the following educational objectives, curriculum, methods and the importance of education for women.

Prophage vB_LdeS-phiJB (phiJB) was induced by mitomycin C and UV radiation from the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SDMCC050201 isolated from a Chinese yoghurt sample. It has an isometric head and a non-contractile tail with 36,969 bp linear double-stranded DNA genome, which is classified into the group a of Lb. delbrueckii phages. The genome of phiJB is highly modular with functionally related genes clustered together. Unexpectedly, there is no similarity of its DNA replication module to any phages that have been reported, while it consists of open-reading frames homologous to the proteins of Lactobacillus strains. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that its late gene clusters, integration/lysogeny modules and DNA replication module derived from different evolutionary ancestors and integrated into a chimera. Our results revealed a novel chimeric phage of commercial Lb. delbrueckii and will broaden the knowledge of phage diversity in the dairy industry.

The Ali observatory, Tibet, is a promising new site identified through ten year site survey over west China, and it is of significance to establish rules of site protection during site development. The site protection program is described with five aspects: site monitoring, technical support, local government support, specific organization, and public education. The long-term sky brightness monitoring is ready with site testing instruments and basic for light pollution measurement; the monitoring also includes directions of main light sources, providing periodical reports and suggestions for coordinating meetings. The technical supports with institutes and manufacturers help to publish lighting standards and replace light fixtures; the research pays special attention to the blue-rich sources, which impact the important application of high altitude sites. An official leading group towards development and protection of astronomical resources has been established by Ali government; one of its tasks is to issue regulations against light pollution, including special restrictions of airport, mine, and winter heating, and to supervise lighting inspection and rectification. A site protection office under the official group and local astronomical society are organized by Ali observatory; the office can coordinate in government levels and promote related activities. A specific website operated by the protection office releases activity propaganda, evaluation results, and technical comparison with other observatories. Both the site protection office and Ali observatory take responsibility for public education, including popular science lectures, light pollution and energy conservation education. Ali Night Sky Park has been constructed and opens in 2014, and provides a popular place and observational experience. The establishment of Ali Observatory and Night Sky Park brings unexpected social influence, and the starry sky trip to Ali becomes a new format of culture

MPC and ALI: their basis and their comparison

International Nuclear Information System (INIS)

Kennedy, W.E. Jr.; Watson, E.C.

1981-03-01

Radiation protection regulations in the United States have evolved from the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In 1959, the ICRP issued Publication 2 which contained specific recommendations on dose rate limits, permissible body burdens, metabolic data for radionuclides, and maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) in air or water. Over the next 20 years, new information became available concerning the effects of radiation, the uptake and retention of radionuclides, and the radioactive decay schemes of parent radionuclides. To include this newer information, the ICRP issued Publication 30 in 1978 to supersede Publication 2. One of the secondary limits defined in Publication 30 is the annual limit of intake (ALI). Radionuclide specific ALI values are intended to replace MPC values in determining whether or not ambient air and water concentrations are sufficiently low to maintain the dose to workers within accepted dose rate limits. In this paper, we discuss the derivation of MPC and ALI values, compare inhalation committed dose equivalent factors derived from ICRP Publications 2 and 30, and discuss the practical implications of using either MPC or ALI in determining compliance with occupational exposure limits. 6 references

A serious of experiments were designed and the results were represented in this paper, in which 2mm thickness cooper shells were impacted by explosives named JB-9014 with different densities, and the surface velocities of the OFHC shells were measured. The comparison of experimental data shows the free surface velocity of the OFHC shell increase with the IHE density. Numerical modeling, which occupied phenomenological reactive flow rate model using the two-dimensional Lagrange hydrodynamic code, were carried out to simulate the above experiments, and empirical adjustments on detonation velocity and pressure and Pier Tang's adjustments on EOS of detonation products were both introduced in our numerical simulation work. The computational results agree well with that of experiments, and the numerical results with original parameters of products and the adjusted ones of JB-9014 could describe the density effect distinctly.

Biosorption of heavy metals and dyes is a promising technology that involves the removal of toxic metals from industrial wastes. The present study aims to screen the bacterial strains isolated from soils and polluted pond for their potential biosorption of both cationic dye and cadmium. Bacillus catenulatus JB-022 strain removed 58% and 66% of cationic basic blue 3 (BB3) and cadmium (Cd(II)) at the respective concentrations of 2000 mg/L and 150 mg/L. The biosorption equilibrium data were well fitted by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the kinetic studies indicated that the biosorption followed the pseudo-second-order model. The biosorption kinetics showed that the equilibrium was reached within 10 min and 5 min for BB3 and Cd(II), respectively. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum uptakes of BB3 and Cd(II) by the JB-022 biomass were estimated to be 139.74 and 64.28 mg/g, respectively. To confirm the surface morphology and functional groups, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were carried out, and the results revealed that the biomass of JB-022 has carboxyl and phosphonate groups as potential surface functional groups capable of binding to cationic pollutants. In conclusion, B. catenulatus JB-022 is proposed as an excellent biosorbent with potentially important applications in removal of cationic pollutants from wastewaters.
