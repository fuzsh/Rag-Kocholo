However, you will have around 30 boosted stories that you can enjoy during that time frame.\n\nLast two weeks, many new writers joined us. I introduce them at the end of this story so you may start exploring their profiles and stories. New writers need support. I also encourage new writers to review some of these exceptional stories and learn from the skills of experienced writers to increase their chances for further distribution and build their audience faster.\n\nIn this episode, I present around 30 new boosted stories. We spend significant time reviewing them, guiding writers, editing/formatting, and nominating them. It is a labor of love among writers and editors. Medium also invest in them to give a great reading experience to members."
