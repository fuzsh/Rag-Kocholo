At the heart of this series is the historical evolution of linguistic and cultural policies, internal as well as external, and their relationship with linguistic and cultural identities. The series takes an interdisciplinary approach to a variety of historical issues: the difffusion, the supply and the demand for foreign languages, the history of pedagogical practices, the historical relationship between languages in a given cultural context, the public and private use of foreign languages – in short, every way foreign languages intersect with local languages in the cultural realm.

Where Greek names have long-established equivalents in English or French (Athens/ Athènes, Greek Royal names such as Otto/Othon), these have been retained. Moreover, as we could not ignore, for historical reasons, the way nineteenthcentury authors signed their own names in the Roman alphabet, nor how places and authors’ names were referenced in nineteenth-century texts, we preferred, in such cases, to preserve the historical forms (for example, Bikélas/Bikelas) or to give both the historical and the established anglicised form of given names (for example, Jean Psichari/Giannis Psycharis). The reader can find all the alternative forms in the index to this book. We decided to give all quotations from and titles of Greek works in monotonic orthography. We anglicised the punctuation in the chapters written in French; for example, we used English quotation marks and removed the space that is normally present in French (such as before a colon or semi-colon, after and before a quotation mark, etc.).\n\nList of figures\n\nFigure 1.1.

This was a far cry from the time when Byron and Chateaubriand had marvelled at the ruins of Hellas and the Western world had unanimously saluted the courage, bravery and heroism of the Greeks in their struggle against the Ottomans. If in 1822 Percy Shelley exclaimed ‘we are all Greeks’1 and Benjamin Constant added three years later ‘the cause of the Greeks is ours’,2 further into the nineteenth century the enthusiasm created by the philhellenism of its first three decades, which had reached its peak in the times of the Greek Revolution of 1821, seemed to have diminished.3 The reasons were both ideological and political. For, as the romantic and neoclassical dreams cultivated by philhellenism and the desire for a return to antiquity weakened, simultaneously Greece no longer appeared in the eyes of European diplomacy as a necessary political and religious bulwark against the Muslim East. However, if ‘true philhellenism, so to speak, historical philhellenism had lasted as long as the war of independence’, as Dimitrios Bikelas wrote,4 and had perished with the foundation of the independent Greek state in 1830, during the second half of the nineteenth century an interest in things Greek 1 Shelley, ‘Preface’, iii. 2 Constant, Appel aux nations chrétiennes en faveur des Grecs, 15. 3 Basch, Le Μirage grec. 4 Bikélas, ‘Le Philhellénisme en France’, 363.\n\nGotsi, G. and D. Provata (eds.), Languages, Identities and Cultural Transfers: Modern Greeks in the European Press (1850–1900).

These were triggered by the military and political adventures and national claims of the small Greek state, and were further strengthened by events in Crete and later in Macedonia. More specifically, the second half of the nineteenth century, marked by geopolitical tensions over control of the Eastern Mediterranean, was a period of profound political, economic and social change for Greece. Greek political life and, more generally, society, popular culture and the literary world were dominated by the ‘Great Idea’, a term first used in 1844 by Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis to express the irredentist Greek ideal. While the small kingdom that had been born in the aftermath of the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) remained under the control of the three allied powers (Great Britain, France and Russia), Greek aspirations for territorial enlargement and the desire to unite all Greeks in one state were powerful. In the course of the nineteenth century this dream of national unification took different forms depending on political circumstances and points of view. It either referred to the ‘redemption’ of Greeks living in Ottoman territories and the restoration of the Eastern Empire with Constantinople as its national centre, or to the geographic expansion of the Greek kingdom with Athens as its national capital, or even (in the early 1870s) to the establishment of a ‘Greco-Ottoman’ state involving the political, financial and cultural takeover of the Ottoman Empire by the Greek nation.5 In several cases during the second half of the nineteenth century this irredentist tendency led Greece into armed conflicts against the Ottomans and other peoples of the Balkan Peninsula. In the irredentist spirit of mid-century, King Otto and his government welcomed the Crimean War (1854–1856) and stood by Russia in the hope that the ‘Great Idea’ could be fulfilled. The Crimean War defined a climactic moment of hostility in Greece’s relations with the European imperial powers. The Greek government’s sympathy towards Russia and the uprisings in the Turkish provinces of Thessaly and Epirus, which the royal couple openly encouraged, provoked the reaction of the Franco-British coalition forces, which occupied Piraeus and Athens between 1854 and 1857.6 Indeed, the failure of Otto’s irredentist policy only served to highlight the weakness of the Greek government in drawing up an effective claims policy, accentuating 5 See chiefly Skopetea, Το ‘πρότυπο βασίλειο’, esp. 257–271. Also Holland and Markides, The British and the Hellenes, 4, on the ‘geographical plasticity of the Great Idea’. 6 See, for example, Skopetea, Το ‘πρότυπο βασίλειο’, 223, 287–289, and Dertilis, Ιστορία του ελληνικού κράτους, 368–370.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n13\n\nGreece’s dependence on the great powers. As the ‘Great Idea’ clashed with the national claims of other Balkan nations, geopolitical tensions continued to mark Greek history in the following decades and underline its importance to European countries in their antagonism with Russia. The climate of mutual political distrust generated by the Crimean War led to a marked decline of the earlier fervent sentiments of European philhellenism.7 The publication of Edmond About’s La Grèce contemporaine (1854), a work whose success extended beyond his native France, only served to underline the new context within which European countries now perceived Greece. Indeed, La Grèce contemporaine confirmed what European public opinion had been feeling for some time: concern for Greece was an outdated matter, the prestige that had fascinated the philhellenes had almost vanished. ‘Nobody much believes in the Turks, but the old Phil-Hellenism is dead, and cannot be revived’, declared the Conservative British Foreign Minister Lord Stanley in the late 1860s.8 Worse, philhellenism had given way to scepticism, even to a certain anti-Hellenism or mishellenism. In the eyes of many Europeans, the Greeks were increasingly perceived as a degenerate and despised race, while the backwardness of the Greek kingdom was commented upon. Hellenic antiquity, which had nourished generations of Europeans, had been desacralised. In 1863, Greece, newly rid of the unpopular Bavarian monarchy, welcomed with enthusiasm the incoming King George I. The title he adopted, King of the Hellenes rather than King of Greece, was interpreted as a sign of a certain political change. Although George I was the second monarch imposed on Greece, the country now appeared to be more credible as a state; hopes were raised that political stability would result. The annexation of the Ionian Islands in 1864 fed this euphoric feeling: the first step towards the unification of the country was taken and the expectations of the Christian Cretans to be reunited with the mother country Hellas were revived. Unlike the Ionian Islands, however, Crete did not enjoy the support of the great powers who, for political reasons and in order to protect their interests in the East, were unwilling to further its cause. In August 1866, the General Assembly of the Cretans declared union with Greece. The siege of the monastery of Arcadi, followed by the holocaust of friends and enemies, in which defenders of the monastery preferred to blow up the women and children who had sought refuge in the powder magazine rather than hand 7 Skopetea, Το ‘πρότυπο βασίλειο’, 163–170. For a more recent overview of nineteenth-century philhellenism, see Tolias, ‘The resilience’. 8 Quoted in Newton, Lord Lyons, 1, 163.\n\n14\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nthem over to the Ottomans, provoked great emotional reaction in Greece and abroad. Philhellenic committees were set up, articles drawing attention to the new struggle were published in Europe and the United States, and volunteers landed on the island. The philhellenic movement underwent a revival which was comparable to the one which shook the West from 1821 to 1827, nonetheless, without ever acquiring the same force. Even if the steadfastness of European public opinion had not effectively pressured European leaders, even if the ardent appeals of the great Victor Hugo had not led to intervention by the European powers and tested the patriotism of George I, these philhellenic reactions succeeded, nonetheless, in enhancing Greece’s international visibility. In the following three decades, the Eastern Question flared up more than once. Most markedly in the context of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, different scenarios concerning the fate of the Balkans in the event that the Ottoman Empire should dissolve took Greece into account; these were in turn fanned by Greek irredentist visions in the East and hopes for the incorporation of territories and populations under Turkish rule within the Greek kingdom. Thessaly was finally annexed in 1881, but the question of Crete and Macedonia became more acute. The economic growth evident especially from 1882 with the coming to power of Charilaos Trikoupis, and realised in the construction of railways, paved roads and the opening of the Isthmus canal of Corinth (connecting the Gulf of Corinth with the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean), contributed to projecting a positive image of a modern state abroad. However, the failure of Trikoupis’s economic policy, which led the country to bankruptcy in 1893, and Greece’s involvement in new conflicts in the Balkan region had negative results for the country. By the turn of the century, the Greek government supported the outbreak of unrest in Crete, which was once again calling for union with Greece. Between 1895 and 1897 the persistence of troubles connected with the so-called ‘Cretan question’ provoked European interference in the island’s affairs and revived philhellenic feelings, especially among the Italians and the French, as sentiments of ideological and religious solidarity among their peoples were supported by the idea of a common Mediterranean civilisation.9 The GrecoTurkish War of 1897, which ended with Greece’s humiliating defeat, forced the government to accept the conditions imposed by the European powers, cease hostilities and withdraw its troops from the island. The annexation was delayed, but Crete succeeded in achieving an autonomous regime in 1898. 9\n\nPécout, ‘Amitié littéraire et amitié politique méditerranéennes’.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n15\n\nObjectives Perceived either as a fundamental Western agent in controlling Slavic expansion in the Balkans or as an Orthodox Christian country intricately bound to Russia’s interests in the East, Greece was under the diplomatic eye of the Western powers. Events before and after the Russo-Turkish War, the Cretan Revolutions of 1866 and 1895–1896 and a series of uprisings in Epirus, Thessaly and southern Macedonia brought modern Greece to the forefront of European political discourse. Therefore, the country was once again in the international spotlight, especially in the last quarter of the century, when armed conflicts became a feature of illustrated weeklies and major popular dailies and war correspondents began sending their reports from the front.10 These historical circumstances nurtured the rhetoric of philhellenic discourse, which found a renewed occasion to express liberal ideas that opposed subjection to oppressive powers and sought to project modern Greeks as a force for progress and stability in the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean more generally. Philhellenic manifestations supported mechanisms of cultural transfer, which in their turn contributed to the shaping or the modification of the perception of modern Greek peoples in Europe. At the same time, modern Greece – debatably the cultural offspring of ancient Hellas – provoked Europe’s scholarly interest by means of an intense preoccupation with the development of European civilisation, well manifested in literary periodicals addressed to the cultivated European public. In their historical context, questions of modern Greece’s cultural condition, its social and material progress as increasingly portrayed in the era’s print media, were essentially of a political nature. If today it is timely to examine philhellenism over the long term and as a transnational phenomenon,11 especially in light of the reverently conceived bicentenary celebrations of 1821 in Greece, an examination of philhellenism specifically in the second half of the nineteenth century may also be fruitful. Our overall aim is to study the image(s) of Greece emerging through the pages of the press. We seek to better understand how European public opinion appropriated those elements which forged the physiognomy of modern Greece in the second half of the nineteenth century. We are especially interested in how European societies captured and depicted historical 10 Kalifa, ‘Faits divers en guerre (1870–1914)’. 11 Espagne and Pécout (eds.), Philhellénismes et transferts culturels dans l’Europe du XIXe siècle; Barau, La cause des Grecs; Maufroy, Le philhellénisme franco-allemand.\n\n16\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nevents involving Greece by projecting their expectations or (often nostalgic) collective imagination; we are equally attentive to the ways Europeans approached medieval and modern Greek civilisation as part of an extended study of the Hellenic world. To what extent, and in what ways did European societies sustain their concern with the fate of this small nation-state and its people, whose independence they had so recently guaranteed? The present volume encompasses a long period of time and press coverage by five different countries (France, England, Germany, Holland and Italy), all central, each in its way, in the European cultural realm. Up to now, the study of cultural interaction between Europe and Greece has been variously pursued: consider the rich discussion of the philhellenic phenomenon in its multiple dimensions; the examination of commentaries on Greece provided by various groups of travellers to the country; the examination of historiographic dialogues between European and Greek intellectuals; the research into philosophical, ideological and political influences exercised by significant intellectuals and major literary works (Byron’s poems, for instance) on Greek self-perception. To date, while advancing to some extent beyond the narrow national context, such investigations of themes and personalities have been largely restricted either to the period spanning the Enlightenment and the first half of the nineteenth century when the Greek state was consolidated, or to particular case studies. More recent work, often produced by scholars who contribute to this volume, has attempted to chronologically expand these research areas to the second half of the century or even beyond. Thus, several investigations have focused on the question of intellectual and cultural interaction between Greece and other European countries with primary emphasis on particular intermediaries,12 while certain others have examined either scholarly networks and the individuals involved in them or cultural practices activated by the transfer of images of modern Greece to Europe.13 The volume seeks to account more fully for the mediation of modern Greece to Europe by examining the print media and their functioning as a singularly important channel for the dissemination of ideas across Europe. All nine essays collected here share as their common research focus the public European print space of the second half of the nineteenth century; 12 For instance: Karathanasis, Η αρχή των νεοελληνικών σπουδών; Provata, ‘Η συμβολή του Δημητρίου Βικέλα στις διαπολιτισμικές σχέσεις Ελλάδας-Γαλλίας’; Mitsou, ‘Négoce et transfert culturel’. 13 For instance: Gotsi, ‘Οι Νεοέλληνες στον καθρέφτη του ξένου’; Mitsou, ‘Δίκτυα (νεο)ελληνιστών και πολιτισμικές μεταφορές στα τέλη του 19ου αι’; Katsigiannis, ‘Η παρουσία Γάλλων ελληνιστών στο Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον του Μαρίνου Παπαδόπουλου Βρετού (1863–1871)’, and Athini, ‘Τα προεπαναστατικά φιλολογικά περιοδικά’ on journals as means of cultural exchange.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n17\n\nmore specifically of the period from the Crimean War (1853–1856) – with its exceedingly unfavourable outcome to Greece – to the Greco-Turkish War (1897) which ended with another severe defeat for the country contributing to its image in Europe as a dysfunctional state in the Balkans. The book’s overall purpose is to investigate aspects of medieval and modern Greek civilisation and society disseminated in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, a time when attention to Greece’s modern culture was more varied than is generally realised. Separately and as a whole, its chapters point to a signif icant European interest in the language, literature and culture of the modern Greeks in the f ive decades under examination. More particular issues explored here involve the factors determining the specific elements of Greek culture that were singled out for mediation, the circumstances of their reception and the political ramif ications of the cultural transfer in each case, as well as the mediating activities of certain individuals with special relationships with the press. Some of the information collected and analysed here may already be known to specialists through other studies in the continuously developing field of cultural transfers; many others are dealt with for the first time. Although each of the case studies featured in the present volume traces particular aspects of modern Greece’s projection to European audiences, most of the authors recognise that the ‘civilisation of the press’,14 by its very nature, fermented conditions for linguistic border-crossing and recontextualisation: more often than not, items on modern Greece were recycled between various print media, constituted translations, summaries or reports of materials initially produced within a distinct cultural and national frame of reference, or were products of collaboration between individuals of different nationalities. What is more, in many instances perceptions of modern Greek history and culture which appeared in European print media were the outcome of networks of international discourse which shared knowledge, concepts and ideas on modern Greece. In other words, they were already products of a multilateral exchange of thought. This collective work endeavours to contribute to transfer studies as well as to European historical and literary studies, especially by exploring intellectual networks, an area that has recently aroused the interest of researchers of modern Greek cultural history and transfers between Europe and the Greek world. Despite, or thanks to, its complexity, the study of networks makes it possible for one to grasp concretely the circulation of 14 For the term, see Kalifa et al. (eds.), La civilisation du journal.\n\n18\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nideas and information within the circles of European Hellenists, intellectuals, illustrious representatives of the Greek diaspora and even, occasionally, of travellers. Indeed, the processes by which these transfers were carried out and the forms of contacts between particular actors who were engaged in them demonstrate that this was an ideological trade that went far beyond the framework of bilateral relations to extend over several national entities, notably Greece, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and the Netherlands. Also, it allows us to observe the bonds of literary or political friendships. Yet, the scope of the proposed investigation is by no means exhausted in the following pages, nor do the studies here included give a comprehensive picture of the networks of the friends of Greece formed in the second half of the nineteenth century. They do, however, provide a better understanding of how they were built and what kind of activities they undertook. Written in English and French, by researchers in various disciplinary fields, they explore several theoretical and methodological perspectives offering a wide image of current research in the field of cultural transfers between Greece and Europe through the press: images, representations and stereotypes, transfers and mediations, circulation of individual personalities and knowledge, cultural mediators and networks are all avenues that have been explored in order to highlight questions of bilateral and transnational cultural relations.\n\nThe press In recent years, researchers all too often look into the phenomenon of the ‘rise of periodical studies’.15 As it has been noted, nineteenth-century magazines, periodicals and newspapers constituted the main means through which contemporary issues and cultural manifestations, both domestic and foreign, reached not only a ‘small and elite intellectual community’ who had access to books, but also a diverse general public.16 Indeed, as mass media, newspapers and magazines of the period were aimed at all types of readers, their audience could be said to approximate the image of a social cross-section of the population. Specifically, it was periodicals that played a broad and active role as cultural mediators between social strata, regional and national entities,17 endorsed the passage of ideas between disciplines 15 Latham and Scholes, ‘The rise of periodical studies’. 16 See the informed discussion with relation to science in Cantor et al., ‘Introduction’, xvii. 17 Loué, ‘Les passeurs culturels au risque des revues’.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n19\n\nand facilitated the transmission, popularisation and in some cases the vulgarisation of scholarly views, scientific knowledge and technological discoveries.18 However, to date limited attention has been devoted to the exploration of the European press in relation to Greece. Addressing this research need, six chapters in this book undertake to demonstrate the agency of particular periodicals that formed a key part in European scientific and intellectual exchange, in the dissemination across Europe of ideas and judgements concerning medieval and modern Greece. A common methodological thread runs through the examination of the Dutch multilingual journal Ελλάς/Hellas by Lambros Varelas, the Italian Nuova Antologia by Francesco Scalora, the French Revue des Deux Mondes by Ourania Polycandrioti, the Nouvelle Revue by Despina Provata and the British Academy by Georgia Gotsi. It involves the systematic and meticulous examination of the journals’ contents, a process that helps to unearth and highlight aspects of modern Greek culture engaging the attention of cultivated contributors and audiences. With the same methodological rigor, but from a different perspective, Alexandros Katsigiannis delves into a scholarly journal, the Annuaire de l’Association pour l’encouragement des études grecques en France, as a place of encounter for intellectuals devoted to the study of Greek culture. Taken together, their analysis shows that interest in things Greek in the second half of the century expanded well beyond the realm of politics, embracing areas of the humanities: the history of language and literature, folklore, history and literature itself. The curiosity of the learned public to which these journals were primarily addressed is reflected in the kind of critical articles, reviews and translations included in their pages. Through their comparative assessment we are better able to identify the vital aspects of the intellectual interaction of European thinkers with Greece: 1) their strong interest in the historical linguistic development of the Greek language and in its dialects; 2) their efforts to establish modern Greek katharevousa (an archaic, purified form of Greek) as a global means of communication and to institutionalise the adoption of the modern Greek pronunciation in the teaching of ancient Greek in Europe; 3) the importance they attributed to modern Greek poetry, especially to folk songs and to poems written in various forms of the vernacular, considered to express the authentic spirit of the Greek people; 4) their recognition of certain poets (principally Aristotelis Valaoritis, but also Athanasios Christopoulos, Dionysios Solomos, Georgios 18 For examples, see the essays collected in Henson et al., Culture and Science in the NineteenthCentury Media; also Chapman, ‘Transnational connections’.\n\n20\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nZalokostas, Georgios Vizyinos and Georgios Drosinis) and prose writers (such as Dimitrios Bikelas) as authoritative representatives of modern Greek national literature, as well as accomplished writers worthy of wider European appreciation. Furthermore, as Christophe Charle has noted, the powerful influence of the press not only informed and affected but also created and disseminated new cultural forms.19 In this instance it not only provided information about various aspects of Greek cultural activity but also played a major role in shaping public attitudes towards the ever-present question of Greece’s cultural development since the post-classical era and its progress since the foundation of the young Greek kingdom. These issues informed the larger controversy concerning the position of the modern Greeks in European civilisation and, by extension, their national aspirations for territorial expansion as well as cultural and political predominance over other Balkan nations. Commentators were far from unanimous, while their stance regarding the modern Greeks, which varied from overtly expressed attitudes to implicit statements, was largely dependent on political preoccupations expressed in their native countries. The newspaper press, although by its nature less prominent than specialised periodicals as a cultural forum, is also included in the scope of this research; under certain circumstances, especially during wartime, newspapers had a wider and more direct impact upon the public mind in shaping the reception of the foreign. Widely distributed newspapers were also more representative of public opinion than periodicals. Alceste Sofou examines such a case. Her chapter looks into the ways French newspapers covered the Cretan Revolution of 1895–1896 leading to the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, which ended with the humiliating defeat of the Greek army and the subjection of the country to international financial control in 1898. She argues that, for the most part, the French press lacked compassion with the suffering of the Christian insurgents in the cause of Crete’s union with Greece. Serving as a powerful organ for the expression of French politics in the East, which supported the preservation of the status quo in the Balkans, it gave voice to feelings of disillusionment with a country unable to respond to Western expectations for a ‘model state’ in the East or for the revival of ancient Greece. Against this background, and offering a varied approach to the question of ‘late’ philhellenism, Sofou interprets public gestures of material and moral support towards the rebelling Cretans as more indicative of a short-lasting ‘crétomanie’ than a reignition of philhellenism. 19 Charle, Le siècle de la presse.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n21\n\nFrancesco Scalora similarly attests to the waning and changing nature of Italian philhellenism in a later period, when different geopolitical interests and irredentist aspirations were diluting the traditional sympathy between the two countries. If in the first phase of the Italian unification movement (up until the early 1860s) Italian philhellenism drew on the appositeness of the Greek Revolution of 1821 as a moral and political template for a country sharing a classical past and also seeking its national independence,20 in the following decades that inspiration persisted more as a cultural rather than as an ideological attitude. Turning his attention to accounts of the modern Greek world in the three decades between the Cretan Revolutions of 1866 and 1895–1896, Scalora attests to the contradictory or ambiguous nature of writing on modern Greece. Looking into the contents of Nuova Antologia di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, first published in 1866 in Florence as a continuation of the illustrious Antologia Vieusseux (1821–1832), a journal instrumental in the development of the Italian philhellenic phenomenon, Scalora discerns both negative criticisms of the Greek state’s political instability and corruption as well as a genuine, albeit inconsistent and idiosyncratic, interest in the history of modern Greek literature, in Byzantium as well as in contemporary Greek cultural production. Symptomatic of this sporadic engagement with Greece was the journal’s outbursts of philhellenic enthusiasm occasioned by a reactivated Risorgimento spirit during the Cretan Revolution of 1895–1896. In this late period, nonetheless, can be found a small number of European high-culture periodicals whose engagement with medieval and modern Greece intended or managed to sustain a positive view of modern Greeks in a period when their ‘true’ identity was under close scrutiny. This positive attitude was often articulated as a confirmation of the common cultural essence linking Greek antiquity with Greek modernity and through this an acknowledgement that the vital intellectual energies of the Greek nation were not exhausted but continued to bear poetic fruits and scholarly products through medieval and into modern times.21 As Georgia Gotsi shows in her investigation of the generalist Victorian periodical The Academy (1869–1916), alongside miscellaneous informative pieces on modern Greece, this publication hosted a series of detailed book reviews which familiarised 20 On the particular nature of Italian philhellenism, see Pécout, ‘Philhellenism in Italy’. 21 Juliette Adam’s perception of Greek poetic genius as a token of national continuity (Basch, Le Mirage grec, 228), or Eugène Yéméniz’s thought on the presence of the ancient spirit (‘génie antique’) in the Greek race as a factor securing its intellectual renaissance (Polycandrioti, Chapter 2 in this volume) are indicative of such a perception.\n\n22\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nmiddle-class readers with the latest Western European and Greek research on the language, literature and history of the Greeks in medieval, early modern and recent times.22 Although contributors to the Academy refrained from expressing explicit political views, and despite certain contested ideas regarding the social and cultural conditions in Byzantium and modern Greece, the periodical’s sustained discussion of the development of the Greek language and the Greek language question, of vernacular creations since the twelfth century, plus contemporary Greek intellectual activities extended the Victorians’ mental exposure to Hellas. The Academy’s perspective went beyond reverence for classical Hellas while at the same time not succumbing to contemporary views which tended to belittle the bankrupt condition of Greece. Most of the scholarly pieces featured in the Academy instilled in its readers an awareness of Greek cultural continuity from antiquity to the present and were instrumental in cultivating, on the basis of such an awareness, a positive welcome for modern Greeks as a people able to assume their rightful place in modern European civilisation. The case of the Revue des Deux Mondes, explored by Ourania Polycandrioti, is quite distinct as this journal was in itself a cultural institution which produced symbolic values for its audience.23 Polycandrioti remarks that the image of Greece reflected by the journal was changeable over its long period of publication from 1829 to 1899 but was always informed by the journal’s classicist character, its idealisation of ancient Greece and its attachment to institutionalised French attitudes, all of which led to biased perceptions of modern Hellenism. Until the middle of the century, modern Greece was seen as part of the Western world which shared the precious heritage of Greek antiquity, whereas its depiction in travel narratives and items on the Eastern Question corresponded to the interests of French diplomacy in the Mediterranean. In the second half of the century, and especially in the 1870s, when French foreign policy took a special interest in the inflamed situation in the Balkans, modern Greece was viewed more as part of the composite Balkan world and the cultural genealogy of its inhabitants was questioned, whereas its present reality falling short of its exalted antiquity was often treated as an anticlimax. Philhellenic writings in the journal that countered such criticism continued to orbit within the tradition of European romanticism, searching for living traces of the ancient spirit in folk poetry as well as in a ‘bucolic’ Greek landscape. 22 On the valuable role of book reviews in cultural transfer, see Thomson and Burrows, ‘Introduction’, 10–11. 23 Loué, ‘Les passeurs culturels au risque des revues’, 205.\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n23\n\nAs Marilisa Mitsou also argues, Europe’s ardent devotion to Hellas had not necessarily excited a corresponding interest in modern Greece. Although the literary philhellenism24 of the early nineteenth century had foregrounded the oral traditions of the Greek folk, it had not succeeded in changing the predominant focus of Western European literati who for a long time continued to meditate solely on Greece’s ancient past. Although Mitsou, for her part, stresses the reverence of the French for the classical tradition, one, nonetheless, did not have to wait too long for the initiatives undertaken by certain Hellenists before modern Greece, its language and literature could become subjects of enquiry in the 1860s; even then, however, the study of Greek civilisation conformed to the concept of its diachronic unity from ancient to modern times. Such a shift of disposition seems to have been more difficult in Germany, where the ‘obsession’ with the Greek ideal ‘had become part of the national patrimony’.25 In the country of Winckelmann, as Mitsou explains, the dominant neo-humanism prevented, even up to the 1870s, any autonomous approach to modern Greece, although a number of German scholars had published works relating to the language and folk poetry of the modern Greeks. The reorientation was made possible mainly thanks to the works and teaching of the Byzantinist Karl Krumbacher, founder of the Byzantinische Zeitschrift. Concentrating on the period from the end of antiquity to the modern age, the journal played a major role in the treatment of Byzantine and neo-Hellenic studies as an autonomous scholarly field. Innovative both in conception and in its contents, this journal sought the connecting links between medieval times and the contemporary era. Its scholarly nature was confirmed by its international character and the variety of subjects treated, covering as they did a vast research area in the Byzantine and modern period. Strongly defined by its founder’s personality, the Byzantinische Zeitschrift published in its pages articles by numerous European and erudite Greek scholars who shared Krumbacher’s views, but inevitably lost its concern for modern and contemporary Greece shortly after his death (1909). Scholarly journals such as the Byzantinische Zeitschrift, much more than just meeting points of individual research itineraries, were fruitful places for intellectual exchange. In certain cases, as we discuss below, they further promoted the interaction between members of groups and networks with correspondent aspirations. Founded around common interests – or even shared projects – these elective affinities gave rise to learned associations 24 Tolias, ‘The resilience’, 55. 25 Marchand, Down from Olympus, xix.\n\n24\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nwhich strove to diffuse Greek studies in Europe. While in Germany, as Mitsou points out, it took up until World War I for the creation of the first Greco-German association (1914) in other countries, such as France, the ground had been more fertile.\n\nSocieties and individual agents The periodical press offers much evidence for tracing the function of formal and informal scholarly networks as forms of connectivity between individuals and discourses across geographical space. Societies of intellectuals constituted an institutionalised manifestation of such networks and, because of their scholarly status and multinational character, operated as effective cultural agents in disseminating ideas across language boundaries. The role of societies in the process of cultural transfer is best illustrated by the three ‘philhellenic’ associations studied in this volume: they were products of joint scholarly ventures, f inanced by ethnic and diaspora Greeks as well as philhellenes, and registered members from different national and diaspora milieux. All three testified to the need for cooperation among European Hellenists, philhellenes and Greeks. Alexandros Katsigiannis sheds light on the networks of scholars and merchants who were members of the Association pour l’encouragement des études grecques en France (founded in 1867 in Paris) and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies (founded in 1879 in London). Since the late 1850s, the revival of study of Greek folk songs and the rediscovery of Byzantium by European and Greek scholars had supported arguments for Greek historical continuity and had led to the production of many studies and editions of older texts written in the vernacular. Members of the French organisation published in the Annuaire de l’Association pour l’encouragement des études grecques en France (its yearbook, 1868–1887) a series of articles united in their shared goal to promote not only the study of ancient Greece and Byzantium but also that of modern Greek language and literature from the fifteenth century to the present. Articles published by members of the British organisation in its philological organ, the Journal of Hellenic Studies, reveal an intense interest in archaeological research and classical studies, despite the fact that the journal had intended to study Greek civilisation in its diachrony from antiquity to its ‘neo-Hellenic’ stage. Mainly due to the efforts of the French network’s members and their extensive contacts with Greek and other European scholars, modern Greek studies gradually emerged in Europe as an autonomous research field, independent from the study of ancient Greece.\n\n25\n\nIntroduc tion\n\nThese two widely and internationally subscribed societies acted as models for the Philhellenic Society of Amsterdam, founded in 1888, and its multilingual organ, the journal Ελλάς/Hellas (1889–1897). The Society’s main aspiration, the establishment of modern Greek katharevousa (an archaic, purified form of Greek used for official and literary purposes) as a global scientific language, adapts a plan previously developed in the circles of Greek and French intellectuals (see Provata below) responding to the era’s needs for a means of international communication. Lambros Varelas, in his comprehensive treatment of the profile and the objectives of the Society and its journal, discusses the leading role of H.C. Muller in their operation. Similar to other cultural mediators discussed in the present volume (Athini, Provata), Muller mobilised his writing skills, his access to numerous European publications and his network of personal contacts and correspondents to promote this central objective, an integral component of his belief in the regenerative role of Helleno-Christian Greece in the Eastern Mediterranean. The journal was in essence a forum of European-wide exchange as it involved an array of Greek and European scholars who expressed themselves on Greek linguistic and cultural issues and offered a considerable number of literary translations from modern Greek. The inglorious decline of the Society’s project indicates the resistance cultural transfer is prone to meet when it is constrained by circumstances and forced to comply with multiple objectives, as the international intersects with the national and the local. Muller’s advocacy of katharevousa Greek as a world language proved to be detrimental to his own objectives since it generated conflict with the supporters of the demotic (the vernacular Greek). The examination of these societies’ journals highlights the particularity of the latter based as it was on one person’s and not a team’s inspiration. Still, all three cases illustrate how positive representations of modern Greece were created and diffused, running counter to other network-generated patterns such as the disdain for contemporary Greece as a backward country, or as an entity separate from the exquisite admirable civilisational paradigm of antiquity. *** Cultural transfers designate movements that take place across space and time but also particular acts performed by certain mediators or passeurs culturels, shaped by their individual preoccupations and managed by their communication strategies. Thus, a privileged way to gain insight into transfer activities is to focus on the agents, i.e. the cultural mediators who undertake them. As Stefanie Stockhorst stresses, ‘the significant processes, especially in\n\n26\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\nthe field of translation, are always carried out and formed by individuals’26 and as Ann Thomson and Simon Burrows recognise, ‘we are still mainly at the stage of studying individual “egocentric” networks, generally centred on particular figures, which provide a valuable insight into their functioning and show their interconnectedness and the ramifications to many different parts of Europe’.27 In this line, this volume combines the analysis of periodicals as collective agents of the transmission of images with the study of the role played by specific intellectuals committed to the promotion of a positive mindset towards modern Greece in the third and fourth quarters of the nineteenth century, respectively. Stesi Athini and Despina Provata bring to the foreground two well-known but lesser-studied mediators around whom networks, formal or informal, were woven: the Greek Marinos Papadopoulos Vretos (1828–1871) and the French Juliette Adam (1836–1936), respectively. The mediating activities of a few others, such as the Greek diaspora intellectual Dimitrios Bikelas who collaborated with Adam, and the British classicist and geographer H.F. Tozer, are also discussed in some of the volume’s essays. As their cases demonstrate, unlike formal networks such as the scholarly associations discussed by Katsigiannis and Varelas, informal networks were often organised around a central personality acting as a ‘go-between’ among individuals with common interests. The place and status of each member in these networks as well as the particular exchanges between different agents deserve to be the subject of another study. Still, it is interesting to note that Vretos and Adam, as also Bikelas and Krumbacher, were also members of transnational networks. Exactly by linking bodies and materials derived through different channels, they succeeded in spreading favourable images of Greece in France, when modern Hellenism was met with suspicion, and through France in Europe. Stessi Athini, more specifically, investigates Vretos’s versatile mediating activity as editor of multiple print media and diverse printed publications in French in his capacity as a journalist and diplomatic representative of the Greek state in France. A multilingual public intellectual, Vretos was mainly active in the 1850s and 1860s, a period in which the reception of modern Greece in Europe suffered from the ‘miso-philhellenic’ climate generated by the Crimean War, and by the hostile reports of French travellers and journalists following Edmond About’s devastating account of the country in his La Grèce contemporaine (1854). Athini describes Vretos’s endless 26 Stockhorst, ‘Introduction: Cultural transfer through translation’, 25. 27 Thomson and Burrows, ‘Introduction’, 7.\n\n27\n\nIntroduc tion\n\nefforts through a series of print vehicles and via different writing genres to improve the image of modern Greeks by demonstrating the distortions in foreigners’ limited perception of Greek social reality, by mobilising French intellectuals in supporting Greek national causes, by documenting the cultural, educational, commercial and material progress of contemporary Greece and by promoting its literary production, arts and crafts. The author, republican and feminist Juliette Adam offers a comparable example of a conscious cultural mediator, who made strategic use of the socially powerful members of her salon, her own writings as well as of the Nouvelle Revue (the well-read international journal she founded) for political purposes. Adam’s deep affection for an idealised ancient Greece, portrayed in her novels, ignited her love for modern Greece, which found political expression in her defence of Hellenism and advocacy of Greek irredentist ambitions via the pages of the Nouvelle Revue. Despina Provata, in a systematic investigation of the periodical’s contents in the years between 1879 and 1899, when it was edited by Adam, reveals its pro-Greek inclinations. Promoting the idea of modern Greece’s civilising mission in the Balkans, the journal argues for the country’s rapid cultural, economic and political progress, placing it among modern European nations. The rehabilitation of Byzantium as an important middle phase in the Greek nation’s continuous historical development, affirms its long historical presence (and rights) in this geographical region. The Nouvelle Revue also showed an interest in the Greek language question supporting through the pen of Psycharis (Jean Psichari) the use of the demotic as the only vehicle suitable for the construction of a national literature. More forceful was the promotion of modern Greek literature in its pages as a testimony to the unadulterated cultural continuity of the Greek nation. The advertising promotion of Greece as an attractive place with public amenities worth visiting by the common tourist offered yet one more means for promoting its modern character. *** Europeans in the second half of the nineteenth century did not share a common view of Greece. Their reactions to it depended on a variety of particular national, political and social affiliations. The print publications here discussed offered platforms for advancing the study of modern Hellenism and representing the Greeks as people who possessed qualities of character inherited from antiquity and also practical abilities to be allowed a place in modern European civilisation. This book argues that the process of cultural transfer enacted through the print was often an expression of\n\n28\n\nGeorgia Gotsi and Despina Provata\n\na ‘late’-nineteenth-century philhellenism: a phenomenon which, in this light, could be analysed as a relational system owing to historical factors but rather more to the exchanges of a number of Hellenists, neo-Hellenists, linguists and archaeologists engaged with modern Greece. The discussion of the subject is far from exhaustive and the methods applied to its study vary according to the particularities of the specific topics under examination. Nonetheless, in their multiple links, the chapters of the book bring to the fore a hitherto unnoticed dimension of Europe’s perception of Greece. They illustrate a shared will in certain European intellectual circles to adhere to an affirmative approach to modern Greece, which despite everything remained the provenance of Western civilisation all the while aspiring towards the Western model of progress.\n\nBibliography Athini, Stessi, ‘Τα προεπαναστατικά φιλολογικά περιοδικά: εκδοχές διαλόγου με τις ξένες γραμματείες’ [The Greek pre-revolutionary literary journals: Aspects of a dialogue with foreign literatures], Σύγκριση/Comparaison/Comparison, 13 (2002), 156–176.

Through a variety of print media (Greek, French or bilingual), he sought to inform the French-language public about the cultural identity of modern Greeks and to confute the distorted image provided by travel literature. Thanks to his excellent education in French, he managed to penetrate the French press, writing about Greek issues. He mobilised around him a network of French philhellenes, Hellenists and journalists who rebroadcasted his positions. Through his Greek-language Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον [National Almanac], he ‘coordinated’ an important discussion on the language question, preparing the road for the foundation of the Association pour l’encouragement des études grecques.

Born in British-occupied Corfu in 1828, he lived for most of his life in France. His father was the scholar, bibliographer and diplomat Andreas Papadopoulos Vretos (1800–1876), well-known in French intellectual circles. From 1836 to 1841, Vretos, residing in Paris, studied at French schools, acquiring in this way an important asset for his future course: an excellent knowledge of the French language. He received a degree from the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Athens (1849) and went on to study law at Pisa. In 1852, thanks to Queen Amalia, he won a three-year scholarship to continue his studies in Paris, where he remained until the summer of 1855. For the next five years, he lived in Athens. Between 1860 until the start of 1869, he again resided in Paris, followed by short stays in Livorno and Marseilles (1870). In this important centre of the Greek diaspora, he fell ill. Following his brief recuperation in a hospital in Nice and Montpellier, he ended up in Paris at the mental hospital of the Greek doctor Xenophon Rotas in 1871. His three-year stay in the French capital (1852–1855) during the critical years of the Crimean War was decisive. He made a series of acquaintances with French Hellenists, philhellenes and journalists – some of whom had visited Greece and retained some interest in Greek affairs – that he would make use of in the aftermath. From the older generation of Hellenists, from the circle of Claude Fauriel and Adamantios Korais, he met J.F. Boissonade (1774–1857), professor of the chair of ancient Greek language and letters at the Collège de France (1828–1855), 4 and the Hellenist Wladimir Brunet de Presle (1809–1875). Boissonade introduced him to ‘his student’, Prosper Mérimée (1803–1870), writer, archaeologist, historian and, now, academic, who had journeyed through Greek regions from 1840 to 1842. Among his acquaintances was also the well-known philhellene Abel-François Villemain 1 Basch, Le Mirage grec, 35–128. 2 For the phases of philhellenism, cf. Tolias, ‘The resilience’. 3 See Verschaffel et al., ‘Towards a multipolar model’. 4 For Vretos’s circle of acquaintances, cf. Dimopoulou, ‘Autour de Marino Papadopoulo-Vreto’, and H.A., ‘Marinos Papadopoulos Vretos’.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n35\n\n(1790–1870) and the diplomat and Hellenist Marie-Louis Jean André Charles Demartin du Tyrac, Count of Marcellus (1795–1861).5 He developed close relations with the academic and journalist Saint-Marc de Girardin (1801–1873), who had travelled in Greece in 1839, Edmond About (1828–1885),6 who had been a member of the École d’Athènes, and others. Vretos’s network of acquaintances would serve to rebroadcast his views within the French press.7 Vretos was basically bilingual, as attested to by his self-translations (French and Greek). But aside from his excellence in French (he is often compared to the classical scholar Henri Estienne), he also had a good knowledge of English and Italian. He was a very active member of the Greek community of Paris. Together with the physician Dimitrios Zambakos,8 he founded, in 1864, the first Greek philanthropic organisation, the Association de bienfaisance grecque de Paris, while somewhat later, he would be recorded as one of the founding members of the Association pour l’encouragement des études grecques en France. Thanks to his connections with Paris’s journalistic world, the Greek state repeatedly assigned him, officially, or semi-officially or secretly, the role of mediator abroad, a matter that he never ceased to seek and to promote in his writings. Initially, he assumed the position of unpaid secretary of the Greek Committee in the Paris International Exhibition (1855) and in 1859 he was sent on a secret mission to the French capital to discover the authors of anti-Greek articles. He was appointed secretary of the Greek general consulate in Paris (1863–1867) by the counsellor to King George I, Count Sponnek, in order to promote Greek interests and afterwards consul to Livorno (1869) and Marseilles (1870). For his role as a mediator, he was given a medal by King George I on New Year’s Day, 1866. Vretos, as mentioned in a self-satirical apologistic note, passed his life ‘scribbling on paper’,9 writing articles for newspapers and correcting essays amid the odours of printing ink. He began his journalistic career during the 1840s publishing original writings, translations and a variety of articles in Athens newspapers and periodicals. He is regarded to be among the first to introduce into Greek literature the ‘urban mystery novel’ and the feuilleton. His texts in Greek had remained until recently dispersed in 5 See Van Steen, Liberating Hellenism; Politis, ‘Η δημόσια ανάγνωση των Περσών’. 6 See Samiou, L’Image des Grecs. 7 The publications referring to Vretos’s work in the foreign press were often republished by him in his Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον and elsewhere (Le Moniteur Grec, Mélanges néohelléniques). For my research in the French press, I used the digital libraries Gallica and Retronews. 8 Papadopoulou, Les Grecs à Paris, 130, 145. 9 Vretos, ‘How to scribble on paper’, 486.\n\n36\n\nStessi Athini\n\nnewspapers and periodicals.10 During the time of his scholarship and studies in Paris (1852–1855) – a period not at all friendly to Hellenism – thanks to his acquaintances, he began to work with the French press, mainly on issues of cultural and social interest. He collaborated with the publications Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel, Bulletin de la Société de géographie, L’Athenaeum français, Revue française, L’Illustration: journal universel and later with Journal pour tous, Revue moderne,11 Annuaire encyclopédique,12 and others, under the name of Marino Vréto or Marino P. Vréto or Vretos.13 He quickly gained a reputation as a reliable source of information in France on Greek issues,14 and in 1858 was included in the Dictionnaire universel des contemporains by G. Vapéreau. He was the publisher of two French-language newspapers, an annual almanac (in Greek), brochures and reprints. To avoid having his work lost in the ephemera of the day, he republished many of his French articles in independent volumes. He also issued an album on Athens, a travel guide and a book of dialogues in four languages. The primary motivation for his French-language works was to encourage interest in modern Hellenism, improve its image and defend it against charges and criticism, as articulated in newspapers and travel narratives. His consistent ambition was to show the distortions in the negative views of foreigner observers, which he often attributed to ignorance or to a lack of understanding of Greek realities. Characteristically, he noted: Do not accept blindly, my friend, the narratives of travellers to foreign lands in which they have only stayed for a brief time and were not able to become familiar with the mores, customs and languages of the inhabitants, particularly, indeed when they deal with the moral standing of a nation, since nothing is more difficult and arduous.15\n\nHe assumed the role of the knowledgeable expert on Greek matters by reason of his nativity. 10 Cf. Varelas, Μαρίνος Παπαδόπουλος Βρετός. The introduction to the volume presents extensively the biographical-bibliographical data on which I have relied. 11 Of particular interest are the historico-political surveys ‘Othon I. Roi de Grèce’ and ‘Le conflit turco-grec’. 12 See the entry ‘Grèce’. 13 For reasons of consistency, we use everywhere the name Marinos P. Vretos. 14 ‘Mouvement littéraire et scientifique en Grèce’. 15 ‘Μην αποδέχου, φίλε μου ουδέποτε, τυφλοίς όμμασι, τας διηγήσεις οδοιπόρων, περί ξένων τόπων, εις ους δεν διέμεινον παρ’ ολίγον χρόνον και ούτω δεν εδυνήθησαν να προσοικειωθώσι με τα ήθη, έθιμα και γλώσσαν των κατοίκων· προ πάντων μάλιστα, όταν αύται διαπραγματεύωνται την ηθικήν κατάστασιν ενός έθνους, επειδή ουδέν δυσκολώτερον και επιπονώτερον’ (Vretos, ‘Αι Αθήναι’).\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n37\n\nEvery time I read a narrative about France, I demand that the author be French, about England, an Englishman. If our own people write erroneously, how much more so do foreigners! They would provoke laughter when they mention the incomprehensible silliness of their narratives.16\n\nWe will try to show Vretos’s multifaceted work as a publisher and writer in the realm of the printed word of the nineteenth century and the issues that he promoted, which he recycled, rewove and distributed through various printed vehicles, and, at the same time, follow the dialogue that he provoked. We will focus on the French-language publications, making a short diversion for his Greek-language almanac, the Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον [National Almanac],17 which belongs to the ‘allophone’ Parisian press.\n\nThe attempt to mobilise French intelligentsia During the time of the Crimean War and the British-French occupation of Piraeus and Athens (1854–1857), and a year after the publication of La Grèce contemporaine (1854) by Edmond About, a work to which was attributed the spread of ‘miso-philhellenism’,18 Vretos sought to mobilise the French through the publication of the miscellaneous volume, La Grèce et les Grecs: pages inédites des MM […] recueillies et publiées par un Grec. There he brought together articles in the French press critical of About’s book and commissioned articles on specific topics which, understandably, rebutted his views. They would be signed by Hellenists, philhellenes or persons knowledgeable about Greece. His publishing plans failed, but we know about the volume’s contents and his collaborators from indirect sources. Aside from the names of Vretos’s acquaintances whom we have already mentioned (Boissonade, Saint-Marc de Girardin, Count Marcellus, Mérimée, Brunet de Presle, and others), also participating were Maxime Du Camp, Flaubert’s travelling companion in Greece, Jean-Jacques Ampère and Charles Lenormant, travelling companions of Mérimée, Charles Lévêque, former member of the École d’Athènes, while approaches had been made to Victor Cousin and Saint-Beuve. Current 16 ‘Οσάκις αναγιγνώσκω διατριβήν περί Γαλλίας απαιτώ να είναι ο συγγραφεύς Γάλλος, περί Αγγλίας Άγγλος. Εάν οι ίδιοι περί των εδικών μας γράφοντες σφάλλομεν, πόσον μάλλον οι ξένοι! θα σε επροξένουν γέλωτα, εάν σε ανέφερον τας ακατανοήτους ανοησίας των διηγήσεών των’; ibidem. On the distorted picture provided by foreign travelers, cf. Politis, ‘Αναζητώντας το αντικειμενικό’. 17 Hereafter, ΕΗ with reference to the year number. 18 Basch, Le Mirage grec, 79–128.\n\n38\n\nStessi Athini\n\npolitical events do not seem to have taken priority. The articles focused on the economic and social situation of Greece, its Ottoman past, its future, the history of Greeks in the West from the fall of Constantinople to the present era. There were to be biographical notes about political figures (Kapodistrias, Kolettis), scholars and poets (Korais, Christopoulos), and issues like Greek hospitality. The book cover for the volume would illustrate King Otto (there was a dispute over whether he would have Greek or European clothing) and Queen Amalia. There were to be pages about the royal couple who had drawn commentary from travellers for the bad taste of their court, which the wife of the former ambassador to Greece, the fervent philhellene Théobald Piscatory, had committed to contribute. The publication of the multifaceted volume in 1855, which attempted to improve the image of Otto’s Greece by means of a French pen, was not realised. The publisher attributed the failure to his transfer from Paris to Athens.\n\nVretos as newspaper publisher a. Le Moniteur Grec (Athens, 1855–1857) Vretos made his first move in the world of the press with the publication of the newspaper Le Moniteur Grec,19 on assignment by the Greek government. It belonged to the French-language newspapers that expressed the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the aim of informing public opinion abroad about Greek issues.20 In this way, Vretos assumed the role of a semi-official mediator for the Greek state. Vretos was chosen for this task – which brought with it a very high salary – due to his excellent knowledge of French, his experience in the French press, the recognition he enjoyed in journalistic circles in France and the network of contacts he had developed. The publication of the weekly newspaper lasted for a year and a half (4 December 1855–1 January 1857). It ended after Vretos’s resignation due to pressures from government officials. The registration of subscribers had been undertaken by a Parisian bookstore and Greek general consulates abroad. The newspaper was read by philhellenes and Hellenists (Brunet de Presle, Boissonade, Count Marcellus, Saint-Marc de Girardin), 19 Εγκυκλοπαίδεια του ελληνικού Τύπου, 4, 434. 20 The birth of the French-language Greek press is dated from the time of the Greek Revolution. Cf. Provata, ‘La presse francophone grecque’.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n39\n\nwho in fact esteemed it for its nonpartisan stance. It was also used as an authoritative source by the French press.21 Royal decrees, parliamentary speeches, and excerpts from the Civil Code were published in its official, condensed section. News items from Greek regions, excerpts from foreign newspapers, statistical charts, useful information and issues of sociopolitical interest were published in the unofficial section, as, for instance, the ‘Résultats déjà obtenus des mesures prises pour la répression du brigandage’, an acute issue within French public opinion and a headache for the Greek state.22 It also carried information about cultural and educational activities (theatre criticism, book announcements, the programme of the University of Athens, reports on the conservation of archaeological monuments, and others). Many of its articles on literary and folkloric issues promoted the relations between modern Greek and ancient traditions, with biographical notes about the intellectual progenitors of modern Hellenism, views on the modern Greek language, and other issues. The articles were signed by Vretos using the initials Ω.Ω., and some of them were later republished in his volume Mélanges néohelléniques (1856). b. The Semaine Universelle (Brussels, 1862–1863) The promotion and defence of the Greek cause through a political, militant and cosmopolitan publication lay behind Vretos’s initiative in establishing the weekly newspaper La Semaine Universelle, which went into circulation on 1 September 1862. The newspaper was edited in Paris and printed in Brussels. The choice of the Belgian capital was due to the legal ban on foreigners publishing newspapers in France. At the same time, the autocratic policies of Napoleon III and interference with the press in the 1850s and 1860s had led many journalists to take refuge in Belgium.23 Announcements about future issues and commentaries in the French24 and Greek press25 as well 21 Cf. characteristically the republication of the article about the visit of the sculptor David d’Angers to Greece and the mistreatment of the statue of Markos Botsaris, which is signed by Saint-Marc de Girardin, Journal des Débats, 1856. 22 Le Moniteur Grec, September 1856. Vretos returns repeatedly to the brigandage, sometimes to criticise travellers for the fantasies (‘Types de voyageurs en Grèce’) and sometimes to assign responsibility to the lack of natural borders with Turkey and the narrow boundaries of the Greek state imposed by European diplomacy (Deux mots aux détracteurs de la Grèce). 23 Sartorius, Tirs Croisés. 24 Cf. indicatively: Le Temps, 8 September 1862; Le Papillon.

In Vretos’s judgement the newspaper should not be devoted exclusively to the Greek or Eastern Question or lavishly promote it. In conformity with its subtitle, Revue politique, littéraire, artistique, scientifique, commerciale, industrielle, financière, its content was multi-thematic. Its publication was supported by donations from the Greeks of Paris, who shared in the cause of the existence of a Greek-owned newspaper in Europe that would defend Greek interests and the rights of the peoples of the East, and would shed light on the Eastern Question. It was expected that, through the collaboration of important French journalists and public affairs intellectuals, the newspaper would construct a European profile, attract a large number of subscribers and begin to pay for itself. This goal was not achieved and the publishing venture ended after a year. Contributing to this was a ban on circulation in France at the end of 1862 and the strict controls that existed on the French-Belgium border that prevented articles from reaching Brussels. Repeated rumours circulated about its ceasing publication, requiring Vretos to issue denials in the French press in order to reassure its subscribers. Many of its collaborators engaged in anti-regime activity, with philhellenic intentions, but also a desire to cultivate a dialogue between West and East. Among them we find the militant journalists Auguste Vermorel (1841–1871) and Henri-François-Alphonse Esquiros (1812–1876), self-exiled in Brussels, Antonin Proust (1832–1905), who had recently travelled in Greece and a few years later participated in the Paris Commune, the well-known philhellene Saint-Marc de Girardin, but also Edmond About. Vretos had been convinced that charges of ‘miso-philhellenism’ against him were hyperbolic and groundless.27 There were many articles about the Eastern Question and Greece (‘La question grecque’, ‘Les colonies grecques en Angleterre’, ‘À propos de certains Grecs’, ‘La Confédération orientale’, and others). Particular coverage was given, also, to the Risorgimento and likely for this reason Vretos was decorated by Victor Emmanuel (1866). The Semaine Universelle gained the respect of a portion of the French press for its criticism of the policies of Napoleon III. It was characterised as 26 ΕΗ 1863, 288. 27 H.A., ‘Marinos Papadopoulos Vretos’, 767–770; Cf. also Vretos, ‘Ο Φιλέλλην Αβούτ’. The view that About’s criticism aimed to show the mistakes of the Greek state and poor administration was advanced by many in France. Cf. Basch, Le Mirage grec, 101, and Grodent, ‘Edmond About’.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n41\n\n‘une sorte de tribune internationale’, as a ‘journal quelque peu multicolore dans ses opinions, et qui les professe à peu près toutes, tour à tour et souvent même à la fois’.28 Moreover, the French press of Paris as well as the provinces, in addition to the Greek-language press, used it as a source for their own coverage of international issues of the day and more.29 Vretos’s decoration for his contribution to the French-language newspaper by King Frederick VII of Denmark, allows for the conjecture that the Semaine Universelle supported the nomination of Prince William for the Greek throne. Under the pseudonym M. Duvray, Vretos published Les Grecs modernes in serial form in the Semaine Universelle. In this text Vretos sustained a dialogue with earlier narratives of French travellers30 as well as with Edmond About’s La Grèce contemporaine, presenting his own ‘more authentic’ version of modern Greek society. Through the genre of physiologies – an early form of the sociology of knowledge31 which found fertile ground within the European press – Vretos offered an anatomy of Greek society, providing an abundance of quantitative and factual data, through representative categories: the seaman and the merchant, the private man, the scholar; the books; the newspapers; the teachers and students; the statesman; the klepht; the priest. This series of sketches – published also as a stand-alone brochure (1862) in editions of the newspaper – offered a documented image to the descendants of the ancient Greeks, proposing that they be re-evaluated. c. Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον [National Almanac] (Paris, 1861–1871) Vretos’s longest-lasting publishing project belongs in the category of both the French foreign-language press and the Greek diaspora press. The Εθνικόν Ημερολόγιον [National Almanac] (hereafter ΕΗ) appeared in Paris annually from 1861 to 1871,32 thanks to the sponsorship of well-heeled Greek merchants, diplomats and subscribers acquired by representatives in many cities of Greece, the Ottoman Empire and the diaspora. Due to its diverse content, it was reminiscent of the French Almanach du magazin pittoresque. Its purpose was to serve as a nexus for all Greeks, as indicated by the use of the noun ‘national’ in its title. Most of its articles came from Vretos’s pen, a large portion of which were his own translations into Greek of his articles 28 29 30 31 32\n\nEscande, ‘Nouvelles de Pologne’. La France. Reynald, ‘Les Grecs Modernes’; Du Camp, ‘Les Grecs modernes’. Lauster, ‘Introduction’. Εγκυκλοπαίδεια του ελληνικού Τύπου, 2, 52–53.\n\n42\n\nStessi Athini\n\npublished in French.33 In that way, it likely sought to transmit to the Greeks the same image of Greece that he projected to the French public. It was richly illustrated, with particular space given to portraits of Greek scholars, military leaders of the War of Independence, politicians, and benefactors as well as foreign Hellenists and philhellenes, accompanied at the back of the volume by short biographical notes. Next to this pantheon of personages, which projected the roots of modern Hellenism, the producers of the Greek revival and national reconstitution, as well as the contribution of foreigners, there were illustrations of archaeological sites, Orthodox churches, and newly constructed Athenian buildings, as well as illustrations that referred to the Cretan Revolution. The readership was in large part Greek-speaking. However, it also reached the hands of foreign Hellenists and whomever were interested in the East and Greece.34 Likely contributing to this effect were the ample illustrations, which ‘translated’ for those who did not know Greek well the elements constituting the identity of the Greek nation. Vretos used this lavish and artful publication as a means for promoting the Greek cause, as well as himself personally. He managed to receive the congratulations of the emperor of Russia, the successor to the throne of England and the emperor of France, to whom he had sent the volumes with a personal dedication. Moreover, for this Greek publication that came out in the heart of France, he was decorated by Napoleon III in 1867. The foreign and mainly French press responded positively to the venture, as well as the image of modern Hellenism that it conveyed, often leaving room for political criticism. The ΕΗ was well regarded since, avoiding political issues that caused displeasure from the French public due to frequent changes of government, it highlighted the particular physiognomy of modern Greeks and provided an image of their productive activity. It established an understanding of modern Hellenism that transcended the political choices of governments.35 It has been received as evidence of the modern Greek language, demonstrating the changes it had undergone from antiquity, while not discouraging whomever wanted to learn it.36 Extensive published articles from the German37 and English38 press made it appreciated as the connecting link for all members of the dispersed Greek family, while at the 33 For reasons of economy, I will avoid quoting in French articles translated into Greek for the ΕΗ. 34 Queux de Saint-Hilaire, ‘La presse’. 35 Girardin, Journal des Débats, 1868. 36 Aubert, ‘Variétés’. 37 ‘Ein Griechischer Kalender’. 38 ‘Reviews. A Greek national kalendar’.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n43\n\nsame time it was recognised for its contribution to whomever desired to get to know Greece. It was considered to be a systematic projection of Greece, thanks to its illustrations and its emphasis on describing modern Greeks.39 A presentation in an English publication, 40 after placing Greece among the few small countries that persistently sought to attract the attention of foreigners, stressed that the ΕΗ did not simply advertise, like a travel guide, a destination that, in any case, was not ideal due to the presence of brigands, but instead an entire nation. It was an advertisement for all of Hellenism and less so for the kingdom, making implications about the political situation. Vretos’s close interlocutor, Saint-Marc de Girardin, 41 saw in him a sober and grounded intermediary for Hellenism within Europe, who had succeeded, with an almanac, disproportionately large for a small state, to make his aspirations understandable, avoiding provocative rhetoric as the new times required with the passing of philhellenism. He managed to show the privileged status of Greece in the East as a country which surpassed the narrow horizons of the small kingdom established by European diplomacy. In the context of this discourse on the superiority of Greece in the East, the following view of a member of the British Parliament earned a respectable place in French and English publications: lorsque messieurs les Turcs publieront un livre comme le vôtre pour l’instruction de leurs concitoyens, et que de tels livres seront appréciés et compris de la nation turque, alors je commencerai à croire à la régénération de cette race; mais pas avant. 42\n\nThe invitation to travel Between the arrival of Kapodistrias and the withdrawal of King Otto, visits to Greece had become more frequent. Along with the steady interest in ancient Greece an interest in the present, newly constituted state and its inhabitants was manifest. An elementary knowledge of the Greek language was essential for travellers, but also for the members of the École d’Athènes who remained in the capital for one or two years, journeying within the\n\n39 ‘Literature’. 40 ‘Reviews. The Greek almanac for 1866’. 41 Girardin, Journal des Débats, 1864. 42 Reproduced by Bonneau, L’Opinion nationale, 1864.\n\n44\n\nStessi Athini\n\ncountry. 43 With the goal of enabling foreign visitors to Greece to gain an elementary understanding of the language so that they would be able communicate with the locals and, generally, to encourage the learning of the Greek language (something not greatly favoured by the ‘Athéniens’44), Vretos published the four-language Le nouveau guide de conversations modernes ou dialogues, usuels et familiers en quatre langues. The addition to the title of the terms ‘nouveau’ and ‘modern’ demonstrate Vretos’s intention to supply the traveller with the new vocabulary which the modernisation in the means of transportation imposed. Recognising also the increased French interest in Athens after the founding of the École d’Athènes and, apparently, the corresponding interest of the Greek community and the diaspora in the new capital, he published in 1860 the bilingual travel guide Αι Νέαι Αθήναι/Athènes moderne that was included in the publication series ‘Bibliothèque du voyageur en Grèce’. It belonged to the new genre of travel books of a useful nature, which came to replace travel narratives, signifying the beginnings of mass tourism. The start had come from England (Murray’s Handbooks for Travellers), which was followed in France by the famous Guides Joanne by Hachette (starting in 1855). Vretos’s publishing venture which, at least regarding Athens, preceded by a year what has until now been considered the first Hachette guide for Greece45 is, in many ways, worthy of notice. It provided authoritative and up-to-date information from the pen of a native who did not need to rely on travel narratives by foreigners, as other authors of travel guides needed to do, submissively and intentionally reconstructing their commonplace advice and observations. As could be expected, it dedicated much space to the Acropolis, to the ‘new’ Parthenon as had been revealed through the excavations of Charles Ernest Beulé, and to numerous other ancient monuments and archaeological finds. But it also proposed many tours through the new city, which was in the process of rebuilding, upgrading and emergent industrial development, without effacing its Byzantine past. The guide included a wealth of detailed information about shops, recreational spots, goods, services – with an emphasis on modernisation and coordination with European tastes – prices for means of transportation, exchange rates, and boat schedules. It included everything that a local ‘tour guide’ should 43 Valenti, ‘L’École française d’Athènes’. 44 For a brief review of the way Greek was taught, the available tools and the reluctance of the members of the school, cf. Basch, Le Mirage grec, 50–69. 45 This is about the Itinéraire descriptif, historique et archéologique de l’Orient by Adolphe Johanne-Émile Isambert (Paris: Hachette, 1861), 1, xv, cf. Basch, Le Mirage grec, 101.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n45\n\nhave in mind for the foreign visitor in order to make his stay safe, pleasant and free from attempts at deception or profiteering which were the typical complaints of travellers. This useful tool sought to show Athens to be a high-quality travel destination – until then it was not the first stop on a journey to the East – which was worth a stay of many days, beyond the one-day visit to the Acropolis.46 As a result, it encouraged a fuller familiarity of the foreign traveller with the capital and its inhabitants.\n\nAspects of modern Greek culture 1. The letters and the arts a. Folk literature Contes et poèmes de la Grèce moderne constitutes the most coherent literary example of modern Hellenism among Vretos’s French-language works. He first published them in French periodicals in 1854, 47 collected them into a volume in 1855 and in an expanded edition in 1858. This consists of prose texts which he himself created, using oral materials. As he notes: Dans mes excursions à travers la Grèce j’avais été vivement frappé de la forme poétique et de la beauté des expressions employées par les gens du peuple; elles sont restées dans ma mémoire, et j’essayai de les reproduire en leur donnant pour cadre quelques récits populaires; mais dans ce travail de mosaïste, tantôt les matériaux, tantôt les dessins me faisaient défaut; j’ai dû alors recourir à ma propre invention, en m’inspirant des souvenirs et du génie national de la patrie. 48\n\nThus its objective was the promotion of ‘la forme poétique’ and ‘la beauté des expressions’ of the ‘gens du peuple’ but also the ‘génie national de la patrie’. Behind these words, we can seek the precedent of Fauriel: a literary event, the publication of Chants populaires de la Grèce moderne (1824–1825), had contributed to the politicisation of philhellenism during the years of the Greek Revolution and opened discussions about the relationship between ancient Greek poetry and the recent poetry of the people. Vretos obviously also knew about the recent case of Count Marcellus, who – promoting 46 Politis, ‘Αναζητώντας το αντικειμενικό’, 242; cf. Gebhardt, Souvenirs, 258. 47 Vretos, ‘Contes et poèmes’, ‘Le pont d’Arta’. 48 Vretos, ‘Envoi. À mon ami Nicolas A. Mavrocordatos’, Contes et poèmes, without pagination [5].\n\n46\n\nStessi Athini\n\nhimself as the successor to Fauriel through the adulterated and plagiarised compilation of Chants du peuple en Grèce in 1851 – had managed to reignite popular interest, attracting the orientalist view of the average Frenchman, but also the linguistic attention of the important Hellenist Charles-Benoît Hase. 49 In writing the introduction to the independent edition of this ‘mosaic’ of prose pieces, Vretos acquired the endorsement of the archaeologist, writer and academic Prosper Mérimée,50 a figure knowledgeable about Greek matters and admirer of the klephtic song and its language, upon which he had in part depended for learning Greek.51 Mérimée recognised in folk poetry ‘un certain art de composition et […] une élévation de sentiments qu’on ne s’attendrait pas à rencontrer dans un état de civilisation peu avancée’ and evaluated the venture favourably through the prism of an archaeologist of culture, ‘que l’on conservât les restes de la poésie populaire, comme on conserve les ruines d’un temple dont on a chassé le dieu’.52 However, those ‘nouveaux fragments de cette muse populaire’ appear to have functioned rather as a pretext for a discussion of the Greek language. Stressing that ‘le Romaïque [the language of the people] a eu sa littérature qui n’a pas été sans gloire’ expressed his interest in the ‘phénomène de linguistique curieux’ observed in Greece and concerned the replacement of foreign-language loans for the new meanings, which had been introduced through the spread of European ideas, with ancient terms. He anticipated the danger of ‘une langue écrite assez bizarre dont Démosthène reconnaîtrait tous les mots, mais que probablement il aurait peine à comprendre’.53 In such views, we are able to detect the simmering opposition to Hase and his criticism of the compilation of Count Marcellus, who was positive about the Greek language’s path towards refinement. In any case, the views of both indicated that in the circle of French Hellenists in mid-century, the ‘anthropological interest in Greek had transposed from historical events and the discussion about the nation and the soul of the people to the apolitical research of the language’.54 Within the French press, in any case, the publication of Contes et poèmes de la Grèce moderne was not connected exclusively to the language phenomenon. It turned the discussion to the ancient past, as well as the unjust devaluation of the present, since it provided evidence that contemporary 49 Mitsou, ‘Στα χνάρια του Φωριέλ’. 50 Vretos, Contes et poèmes, 7–16. 51 See Tsaliki-Milioni, ‘Ο Προσπέρ Μεριμέ’. 52 Vretos, Contes et poèmes, 7–16. 53 Ibidem. 54 Mitsou, ‘Στα χνάρια του Φωριέλ’, 38.\n\nMarinos Papadopoulos Vre tos\n\n47\n\nGreece enjoyed an original poetic virility, by no means inferior to that of its illustrious ancestors.55 It was celebrated as a gift to Western literature, since it brought to light the authentic simplicity of the songs of Greece ‘disdained and misunderstood’, which tried to walk honourably in the footsteps of poets who continued to have the admiration of the entire world for the last 30 centuries.56 The people once more showed themselves to be the true poets of modern Greece. The collection merited the attention of serious readers, since no one could now assess Greek antiquity without studying the new Greece.57 b. Learned literature Contemporary written literature holds a low place in Vretos’s Frenchlanguage publications from the middle of the 1850s. Our research discovered only two book reviews of recent publications: the poetic collection Αρματωλοί και Κλέπται [Armatoloi and Klephts] by G.Ch. Zalokostas58 and Kolokotronis’s memoirs of 1852.59 The book presentation of Zalokostas is not lacking, certainly, in criticism for his poetry, but since the themes of both books are drawn from recent Greek history, the preparation"
