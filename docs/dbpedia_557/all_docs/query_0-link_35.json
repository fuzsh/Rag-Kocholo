Tourists to North Cascades National Park will not only have the chance to see black bears and soon grizzly bears, but also get deer, marmots, otters, mountain goats, and even wolves.\n\nWe headed back to Bellingham, and we ended up riding and did some moves that had only recently put down on the big bike. And even hit one move I had never done yet.\n\nIn the end, North Cascades National Park in Washington state came out on top with a rating of 89.7 out of 100.

North Cascades came in just short of 90, with an 89.65.\n\nIf you don’t have to, why would you spend more money on flying to your travel destination rather than shopping, taking an excursion or treating yourself to a nice dinner? We are noticing an increasing number of travelers driving across the Canada-US border to fly out of Bellingham International Airport (BLI), and we think they are on to something.\n\nMy favorite, which I can not shut up about, was the Portofino at Storia Cucina with gin, lemon, tonic, celery bitters, and a little salt that drew the refreshing qualities of the vegetable. I had some other vibrant drinks, but this one has stayed on the tip of my tongue because of the delicate dance of each flavor note\n\nDecided to take a little roadtrip up to some greenery and visit the Transition crew in Bellingham, WA! It was nice to escape the dry desert for a few days and ride some of the best trails around. Will hopefully be back up that way soon in the search of more gems to ride.\n\nI’d like to encourage you to view Bellingham as more than a brief break in your journey, as it’s a destination worthy in and of itself.

While hiking solo, it can also be comforting to know other people are around in case something goes wrong.\n\nAccording to a recent permit filing, Bry’s Filipino Cuisine will soon open a brick-and-mortar in Bellingham at 1151 N State St. \"Bry’s will have traditional and modern-style Filipino food with a nice ambiance and a bunch of specialty cocktails.

After gradually ascending through the forest, the trail bursts into the alpine with views of jagged granite ridgelines, streaming waterfalls, and glacier-carved valleys.\n\nDay 6: North Cascades National Park\n\nThe fact that North Cascades National Park is free to enter doesn’t mean it isn’t still worth at least one full day of enjoyment.

Mount Baker Scenic Byway\n\nWe may be cheating a little bit, but every mile of the Mount Baker Scenic Byway is filled with remarkable scenic vistas and incredible overlooks.

This byway actually contains some of the most photographed landscapes in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn December 1998, Jeff Hambelton graduated from Western Washington University with big plans: to become a snowboard bum for the winter. His timing was perfect: During the 1998-99 snow season, Mount Baker received 95 feet of snow, setting the national and world record for the most snowfall in a year. The mark stands 25 years later. No annual total has since come close, at Mt. Baker or any other ski hill on the planet.\n\nBirch Bay\n\nBirch Bay is a thriving bayside town on the Canadian border. The crystal waters with far-off islands make for excellent rural views in this small town. Visitors can relax on Cottonwood Beach and watch the sunset over the water.

The massive snowfall is also well-known.\n\nMount Baker rests at 10,786 feet above sea level. It has a prominence of 8,812 feet and is listed as North America’s 28th most-prominent peak. It is also one of the ten highest peaks in the entire Cascade Range.

Baker Ski Area\n\n“Our focus is on the home mountain experience,” says CEO Gwyn Howat. That means no advance sales with variable pricing, just sub-$100 day tickets and limited season pass sales. With steep slopes on the shoulder of Mount Shuksan (Baker itself is a few miles away) and record-breaking snowfall from marine air, beginner terrain is limited; out-of-bounds powder slopes are legendary.\n\nBistro Estelle - Bellingham, Washington\n\nIt’s not that it took a trio of EMP alums to put Bellingham, Washington—a small city north of Seattle and just shy of the Canadian border—on the map. That happened back in 1903 when it was incorporated. But the culinary credentials of the chef and his partners undoubtedly make the town more delicious.

It’s best known for summit climbs like the Beckey Route and Liberty Crack on Liberty Bell, the closest tower to the road. But the super-short approach from State Route 20—short by alpine standards anyway—along with a selection of great half-day climbs and some primo bouldering, make this an awesome destination for rock climbers as well.\n\nNorth Cascades National Park\n\nThe North Cascades National Park may be one of the least-visited national parks, but that's just part of the appeal: no long lines, and plenty of peace and quiet.
