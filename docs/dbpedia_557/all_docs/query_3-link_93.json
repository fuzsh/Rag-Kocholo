        "text": "At the Prova Theater we will enjoy from Saturday, December 2, 2023 and every Friday - Saturday and Sunday, the hilarious comedy by Chrysa Spiliotis entitled \"Scottish Shower».\n\nDirected by Sotiris Tsogas\n\nThe comedy of the year at the PROVA THEATER\n\nFrom Saturday 2 DECEMBER 2023 and every Friday – Saturday and Sunday\n\nSotiris Tsogas, inspired by the text, of which he also signed the theatrical adaptation, with his directorial masterful eye, interactively puts us in the atmosphere of the creation of a theatrical performance, from the dressing rooms to the stage.\n\nComedic scenes to the point of tears unfold before the eyes of the viewer, who sometimes, unintentionally or intentionally, becomes part of the show, in which Mary Razi, Sotiris Tsogas, Kostas Darlasis, Antonis Ziogas, Katerina Zacharioudaki and Emilia Giakoumopoulou star.\n\nA few words about the project:\n\nA...\"scandalous erotic\" troupe is rehearsing for \"Lysistrata\". Fotos, the director, envisions his show traveling beyond borders by ridiculously adapting Aristophanes while taking advantage of his position by flirting with all the ethereal beings of his theater.\n\nAt the same time, his arrogant actors each follow their own vain path. His wife, Marili, has supported her faltering career in a compromised marriage, Leto sells sex to get high but also to buy love, Effie struggles to learn to say NO without meaning YES, Orpheus, if and tries to resist the destructive trend that leads the world to give in to love and Babis seeks acceptance of his homosexual identity, while in reality he has not accepted it himself.\n\nAs the rehearsals progress, the explosive relationships that arise between them unfold in a spartan manner. of desire, in a relationship of men and women inversely proportional to that of \"Lysistrates\" who struggle to raise...\n\nCREDITS\n\nAuthor: CHRYSA SPILIOTI\n\nAdaptation of Text: SOTIRIS TSOGAS\n\nDirection - Lighting: SOTIRIS TSOGAS\n\nSets-Costumes: MATINA MEGLA\n\nMusic: NIKOS HARIZANOS\n\nLighting design NYSOS VASSILOPOULOS\n\nVideoArt: PANAGIOTIS TSAGAS\n\nChoreography: KATERINA ZACHARIOUDAKI\n\nFirst Assistant Director: ANTONIS ZIOGAS\n\nXNUMXnd Assistant Director: IOANNA FRAGISKOU\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nMarili: MARY RAZI\n\nPhoto: SOTIRIS TSOGAS\n\nBabis: KOSTAS DARLASSIS\n\nOrfeas – Lefteris: ANTONIS ZIOGAS\n\nLeto: KATERINA ZACHARIOUDAKI\n\nEfi: EMILIA GIAKOUMOPOULOU\n\nDIRECTOR'S NOTE\n\nA troupe is rehearsing to stage Aristophanes' Lysistrata. And the microcosm of the theater becomes a magnifying lens and reveals the \"behind the scenes\" of the functioning of modern society, through a merciless satire.\n\nThe \"Scottish shower\" by Chrysa Spiliotis denounces the indifference to common sense and reality on the one hand, and the interest in verisimilitude and illusion on the other, that run through modern societies.\n\nThis work poses the most serious and complex problems of modern societies in the most ridiculous and entertaining way, holding before the viewers a huge mirror to see themselves and others.\n\nA tragically timely and uniquely comic work, which gives the opportunity for an interactive spectacle and listening, with new aesthetic and technical stage approaches.\n\nIt is a theater within a theater. And this within the social \"theatre\". A work amenable to triple reading. The multiplicity and complexity of the \"roles\" shouldered by the modern man constitutes a social farce, where everything is allowed and everything is forbidden. Where the boundaries between fantasy and reality, want and must, truth and lie, fake and genuine, \"good\" and \"bad\" are perforated. Chrysa Spilioti in \"Scottish Shower\" alternates with ingenuity and skill, with a dramatic flair, the comic with the tragic, the satirical with the comic-tragic, the farcical with the dramatic, the melodramatic with the parodic. The choice of the work that the troupe stages in \"Scottish shower\" is not accidental. \"Lysistrata\" (called Lysistrata instead of \"disband the army\") is the last anti-war and peaceful message of the great comedian and summarizes the most ancient, but timeless call to people to make love, not war. Call, revived by the hippies in their struggle against the war in Vietnam, when Lysistrata too was glorified on the stage by the theater groups of the Universities and other troupes in the USA, as the head of that great Peace movement, which unfortunately was treacherously eroded and degenerated by the power system.\n\n(In Greece, moreover, this work of Aristophanes was in an idiosyncratic semnotypic quarantine until the middle of the 20th century.)\n\nIn \"Scottish shower\" Chryssa Spilioti artfully creates an atmosphere, where the \"arbitrary\" exaggerations and illusions, the fluid-playful-outrageous appearance, the overturning of \"traditional\" gender roles, the use of reversals, coincidences and misunderstandings change any truth in a shining lie.\n\nIt is an authentic comedy, which \"spoofs\" the drama of human relationships in modern societies. Theatrical hypocrisy confronts social hypocrisy, and this conflict irradiates human relationships, the implacable \"battle\" of the sexes, man's mania for dominance and advantage, his insatiable desire for glory, power and wealth, sex and flattery as a means of professional advancement, the shadow battle of the unworthy with the worthy, the incompetent with the capable, the mediocre with the excellent, the perpetual \"begging\" for \"recognition\" and \"acceptance\".\n\nChrysa Spilioti with \"Scottish Shower\" takes us safely and boldly from theatrical performance to social hypocrisy, from the conventions of the Stage to the conventions of society. THIS TRIP IS WORTH IT.\n\nSotiris Tsogas\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE for the show's first upload in 2000\n\n\"The director who, with his domineering attitude, troubles the troupe. The actors who \"return\" the suffering to the director with their \"pumps\" and their sensitive Ego. And when the rather confusing love entanglements begin, then the problems that arise regarding the staging of Lysistrata's performance multiply dangerously....\n\nThis is Scotch Shower (2000), my second attempt at playwriting which is presented in a few days at Ilisia Studio. It is a work very different from the previous one, Who Discovered America?, both in terms of subject matter and the composition of the troupe. Above all, however, my goal in this venture was to write a real comedy, with which people will laugh effortlessly.\n\nBut at the same time I wanted to use humor as a vehicle in order to talk about some things a little more \"difficult\", such as, let's say, people's relationships both on a professional and personal level.\n\nHowever, I believe, and here I am speaking as an actor, that eliciting laughter from the audience is much more difficult than trying to move them. With a dramatic play you can also fool yourself, here you don't have such leeway [...]\n\n(Chrysa Spiliotis, \"To Vima\" ed., 9.1.2000)\n\nARTISTIC IDENTITY OF THE PROBA CULTURAL ORGANIZATION\n\nThe Prova Cultural Organization started its activity in 1984 and acquired its first theater roof in Monastiraki under the name \"Ermou Street Theatre\".\n\nSince 2001, the Prova Theater has been housed in the two-story preserved neoclassical building at 39 Acharnon and Epirou streets.\n\nThe Prova Theater has three stages: the Central Stage, the Second (Experimental) Stage as well as the Children's Stage and is in its 39th year of continuous artistic development. He has to his credit 90 productions, participation in 4 international Festivals, many distinctions and many ensemble and individual awards.\n\nThe valuable archival material of the theater has been digitized and is available to the public on the platform https://online.prova.gr/\n\nIn the same space is housed the Higher School of Dramatic Art of Mary Razi \"The Rehearsal\", the Theater Workshop for children and teenagers, under the direction of Koralias Tsoga and a Workshop for the Preparation of the Entrance and Qualifying exams of the art schools.\n\nFrom the performance art of the Rehearsal Theatre, it is clearly demonstrated the consistent and long-term service of goals of high aesthetic and quality artistic creation, but also the search, research and study of new codes and methods of acting. Among other things, the Prova Theater has devoted itself to the research and study of Ancient Greek Tragedy, but also to the promotion of modern Greek drama, with an emphasis on the presentation of such masterpieces of the 20th century (Bogri's Drakaina, Horn's Flandro, Mela's One Night and a Life). , as well as contemporary unplayed modern Greek works (Bost, Patsis, Takopoulos, Mentis, Mitropoulos, Dialegmenos, Hasapoglou, Panagopoulos, Simitzis, Chrysoulis, Malelis, Karras, Kampanellis, Murselas, Spiliotis).\n\nIn total, the Prova Theater presented 44 Greek plays and 46 foreign ones, both from the classical and from the modern repertoire.\n\nIn collaboration with the publishing houses \"Dodoni\" and \"Capricorn\", we published 32 books-programs with the texts of the plays we staged.\n\nThe Rehearsal Theater was granted a grant for the \"Scottish Shower\" by the Ministry of Culture.\n\nChrysa Spilioti: A resounding absence – of Eugenia Lidorikis\n\nActress, director and writer, whose strongest memory from her childhood was a scare she got one day in kindergarten. Their teachers used to wear a towel for them to eat their tithe and Chrysa's towel string broke. He thought that the teacher would be very angry for the \"crime\" he committed. She ran to the school and started begging the bus driver to take her home. He notified all the teachers and they assured her together that they would not harm her. She had a worse panic, that they were going to kill her all together and she was crying, calling for help and didn't come down from the school with anything. \"what are the poor children doing?\" he was saying. Decisive for her later life but also for the formation of her work – perhaps unconsciously – was the relationship with her mother and also her views on motherhood in general.\n\nThe relationship with her mother was very difficult because one always wanted to change the other. There was no acceptance and respect for their diversity. She didn't have any biological children but that never stopped her from feeling like a mother. She had maternal feelings for her husband's daughter, Alice, and greatly admired women who have adopted children, who can offer love without seeing the children as a perpetuation of their DNA. He also considered it admirable to adopt children from other races.\n\nBut fate played a bad game for her and her husband. It was Monday, July 23, 2018. Chrysa Spilioti, like every day, swam in the Red Harbor. The fire that day, which was out of control and consumed 101 people. 101 deaths. Despite the fire, the actress decided to return home to Mati and notify her husband. \"Don't go over there, it's dangerous, go back to the sea\" her neighbors shouted. She didn't listen to them, she wanted first and foremost to save her husband. They were both caged with devastating effect. They are among 101 dead. \"My dear friends, today my best friend of 32 years has been identified and is now officially dead,\" wrote Anneta Papathanasiou, an actress, while the once-little Aliki Tournaviti wrote on social networks: \"and the curtain fell. End titles for both my heroes\".\n\nAs pointed out by Kyriaki Petrakou, professor of the theater studies department of the Greek Academy of Sciences, in the play \"Scottish shower\" Spilioti explores the life of the theater in a modern farcical style: a troupe stages Lysistrata. Of course, it is dominated by a male director who locates the issue in the war of the two sexes and characterizes Lysistrata as the first feminist in history. He also clarifies that Aristophanes' time is historically closer to matriarchy than patriarchy, according to Engels and Marx. He has romantic relationships with some of the actresses, who between them are inevitably competitive and generally complain that they are always the losers in love, although it is indiscernible whether they accept sex for selfish reasons or bewitched by its prestige.\n\nThe works of Spiliotis, of course, differing from each other both thematically and in dramaturgical technique, belong to a mainstream of modern Greek dramaturgy that could be called \"metarealism\" with free movement in time and the subconscious with flashbacks which is now a common technique in modern theatre. Much is dominated by humor and satire, but humanity always shines through. It is a work with a place and an obvious intention to make the audience aware of the drama of the modern world.\n\nThe same author notes that the play is about the director who, with his domineering mood, makes the troupe suffer, the actors who, with their bravado and their sensitive egos, return suffering to the director.
