Since the current, gradually growing, scholarly field was recast as one of ‘reception’ in the 1990s,1 its working assumption—almost by definition—is that there is a gap between the ‘giving’ era and the ‘receiving’ one.2 This hiatus is precisely the subject matter of this fascinating scholarly field, and values play an important role in this difference.3 The concern with morality was also predominant when this field 1 See Maarten De Pourcq, “Classical Reception Studies: Reconceptualizing the Study of the Classical Tradition”, International Journal of the Humanities 9 (2012) 219–225. The term “Reception” comes from literary studies to emphasise the fact that the meaning of works of art is constructed and imparted by the readers. See Charles Martindale, “Introduction: Thinking Through Reception”, in Charles Martindale and Richard F. Thomas (eds.), Classics and the Uses of Reception (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006) 3–4, who refers to the influence of the theory of Hans Robert Jauss, Literaturgeschichte als Provokation (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1970). See Felix Budelmann and Johannes Haubold, “Reception and Tradition”, in Lorna Hardwick and Christopher Stray (eds.), A Companion to Classical Receptions (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008b) 13–25 [13–14]. 2 See Duncan F. Kennedy, “Afterword: The Uses of ‘Reception’” in Charles Martindale and ­Richard F. Thomas (eds.), Classics and the Uses of Reception (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006) 288–293 [288]: “A constitutive move of reception theory is that there is always a gap between a text (or utterance) and its reception. This gap introduces difference, and it is in this gap that history operates”. See Lorna Hardwick and Christopher Stray, “Introduction” in Lorna Hardwick and Christopher Stray (eds.), A Companion to Classical Receptions (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008b) 1–12 [1–2]: “By ‘receptions’ we mean the ways in which Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, reimaged and represented … [distinction] between the different traditions and contexts from which they have emerged”. See the criticism against the use of this term as implying a passive reception: Simon Goldhill, Who Needs Greek? Contests in the Cultural History of Hellenism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 297. Cf. Tim Whitmarsh, “True Histories: Lucian, Bakhtin, and the Pragmatics of Reception” in Martindale and Thomas (2006) 104–115. 3 See Lorna Hardwick, Reception Studies (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) 3: “The diversity of ancient culture itself is now more widely recognised and interest has focused on ways in which some aspects were selected and used (‘appropriated’) in order to give value and\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���7 | doi 10.1163/9789004347724_002\n\n2\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nassumed the model of ‘influence’ or ‘legacy’ in works dealing with the Classical Tradition,4 or in 18th and 19th centuries’ discussions on the relevance of the classical values to the modern period.5 As an instance of cultural reception studies,6 Classical Reception deals with the appropriation of phenomena belonging to one culture by another or with the appreciation of one society by another; it addresses the ways phenomena gained new cultural meanings, functions and forms as they were absorbed in new ethical settings.7 Yet, this field stands outside cultural studies proper in its corresponding interest with the Classical past, assuming that the classical set of values is the object of study worthy of itself.8\n\nstatus to subsequent cultures and societies and to inspire new creative work. This kind of study has proved valuable in that it has enabled people to distinguish more readily between the ancient texts, ideas and values and those of the societies that appropriate them”. See also Hardwick and Stray (2008a) 5. 4 See Gilbert Murray, The Classical Tradition in Poetry (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1927); Gilbert Highet, The Classical Tradition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1949). Budelmann and Haubold (2008) 24: “classicists give themselves a particular role by placing themselves in a continuous and value-laden tradition that reaches from antiquity to their own day”. 5 A few examples will suffice. See Neville Morley, Antiquity and modernity (Oxford and Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell 2009) passim and 23–24: “Antiquity was the great exemplar of the disastrous consequences of luxuriousness for military prowess, sexual continence, and political liberty, and hence the obvious model for understanding contemporary developments and their likely terminus. On the other hand, antiquity was also the yardstick for frugality, virtue, and the philosophical denunciation of luxury”. Cf. Frank Stack, Pope and Horace: Studies in Imitation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 6–7 on an 18th century appreciation of Horace. See Alastair J.L. Blanshard, Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity (Chichester and Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010) 145 on Richard St. John Tyrwhitt’s attack on the imitation of Hellenic culture (“The Greek Spirit in Modern Literature”, 1887, 558): “Hellenism means, at the present day and when you come to work it, the total denial of any moral restraint on any human impulses”. Cf. Frank M. Turner, The Greek Heritage in Victorian Britain (New Haven, ct: Yale University Press, 1981) 264–83 on the relation to the sophists. See Kenneth Haynes, “Text, Theory, and Reception”, in Martindale and Thomas (2006) 44–54, and Katie Fleming, “The Use and Abuse of Antiquity: The Politics and Morality of Appropriation” in Martindale and Thomas (2006) 127–137. 6 Cf. Richard K. Simon, Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition (Berkeley—Los Angeles—London: University of California Press, 1999); Karen Bassi and Peter Euben, “DeClassifying Hellenism: Untimely Mediations”, Parallax 9 (2003) 1–7. 7 Cf. Salvatore Settis, The Future of the ‘Classical’ (Tr. A. Cameron. Cambridge and Malden, ma 2006) (translation of Futuro del ‘Classico’) (Turin: Einaudi, 2004) on the relevance of the classical to current social, political, and moral values that it helps to legitimate. 8 De Pourcq (2012) 223.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nIn fact, Classical Reception Studies are about the Classical as well as about the modern.9 By “Classical” we refer to the ancient Greek and Roman world, and include here examples from mythology and history, as well as examples from what ancient contemporaries would term “barbarian” culture, namely, Jewish ancient history. By “modern” we mean roughly the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries, although the early modern period (approximately the 17th to 18th centuries) is sometimes mentioned as well. The working model of Reception Studies we adopt in this volume is largely that of a meeting of these two worlds, contiguous in various points and especially in the plane of values. In order to understand the way these two worlds interact in our volume, let us examine first the key concepts addressed or alluded to in the following contributions: the features of ancient morality, or what was considered virtue or vice; the meaning of modern popular culture and modern reception. At the end of this introduction we shall explore how the following chapters contribute to a better understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nAncient Virtues and Vices\n\nAs we shall see, the studies presented in this volume trace the interaction between two sets of values, the modern and the ancient, in various means and modes. The ancient and modern periods display a wide diversity of popular value systems. These include not only ethical attitudes and codes of conduct or systems of values delineating good and bad, but also the interweaving of artistic and literary appreciation of artefacts and narratives (e.g., attitudes towards heroes and villains, their traits and character) and aesthetic judgment of what is considered beautiful, complete, grotesque or ugly. There are many different ideas about, and approaches to, the nature of morality. These include popular notions of morality, and philosophical or theoretical ideas on the subject,10 as well as philosophical ideas of morality 9 See Duncan F. Kennedy, “Review of Literature in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A New Perspective, ed. Oliver Taplin (Oxford, 2000)”, Greece and Rome 48 (2001) 87–8: “is as much about eventuation as it is about original context … that is what ‘Reception Studies’ seeks to capture …” 10 See, for instance, Albert P. Brogan, “A Study in Statistical Ethics”, International Journal of Ethics 33 (1923), 119–134 [121]: “By popular morality is meant especially the moral opinions of those who have never had any set training in systematic ethics”. See Stephen R. ­Blum-West, “The Seriousness of Crime: A Study of Popular Morality”, Deviant Behavior 6 (1985) 83–98. These attitudes were important to Mill, as shown by David Lyons, “Mill’s Theory of Morality”, Noûs 10 (1976) 101–20 [107]: “Informal social rules—the elements of\n\n4\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nand ­religious notions, both of which may prescribe proper ways of conduct to adopt and reject. When it comes to reception, there is a variety of ways in which these approaches can interact. Thus, a philosophical or religious ethical notion from one period could be appreciated and acclimated in a popular way at a later period, and vice versa: an exemplum of popular morality typifying an older historical community could be integrated into philosophical or religious notions in a later society. Of course, two other possibilities of adaptation (historical popular morality in a later popular notion and an ancient philosophical ethical reasoning taken on by later religious or philosophical theorists) may exist as well. In this volume we examine the reception of the ancient world in modern popular presentations, which by definition applies more to popular morality than well-argued and systematised philosophical reasoning. Unfortunately, our knowledge of ancient Classical ethical notions is impaired by the meagre sources we possess of the great civilisations of the past. We are still in the dark concerning the “Dark Age”, the time before writing became an essential means for communication and recording thoughts and impressions. Due to acts of chance, such as the demise and disappearance of libraries or political and natural upheavals, entire centuries are under-represented in the extant corpus of texts. With the coming of Christianity, Pagan religious and cultural values (reflected in ancient works of philosophy, drama, oratory, poetry, art, legality and more), now identified as “Hellene”, were deemed utterly repugnant to the extent that complete volumes and artefacts were purged and destroyed.11 Although this Early Christian form of reception (religious-theoretical\n\n11\n\npopular or conventional morality—can also be conceived of as coercive commands and prohibitions. These are generally accepted standards for minimally acceptable behavior, whose existence is a matter of general knowledge before the acts they concern are contemplated or performed”. This difference partially matches that between “morality” in a narrow sense, restricted to deontological moralism or philosophical systems concerned with duty or obligation, and “ethics”, which is more practical.

Stephen Halliwell, “Popular morality, philosophical ethics and the rhetoric”, in Alexander Nehamas and David J. Furley (eds.), Aristotle’s “Rhetoric”: Philosophical Essays” (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press 2015) 211–230. See Anthony Kaldellis, Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2007) 121–143. A notable case is the destruction of the Serapion Temple and library in Alexandria (ad June 391) by the local mob, instigated by the Emperor Theodosius i (Cod. Theod. 16.10.10-11) and the patriarch Theophilus. See Rufinus, he 2.23, Socrates Scholasticus, he, 5.26-27, Sozomen, he, 7.15, 20. Other temples were destroyed (Eunap. vs 472.; Theodoret, he 5.22).

In his well-known volume on Greek Popular Morality in the Time of Plato and Aristotle, Kenneth Dover attempted to bypass certain of these problems and arrive at what “most people” say and think.14 While his methodology is to be commended, there are still various problems that must be acknowledged in attempting to fathom a better understanding of this facet of ancient life.15 Of course, the value judgments and attitudes of philosophers may reflect popular morality or even influence it, either immediately or after a great period of time, but the two are notionally dissimilar.\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n“Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician, Astronomer and Philosopher”, in David Fideler (ed.), Alexandria 2 (Grand Rapids, mi: Phanes Press, 1993) 45–56.

The basis for the initial appropriation of elements of Greek culture by early Christians was the fiction (first voiced by Hellenistic Jews) that the Greeks stole all the respectable facets of their culture from the Old testament (a play on the barbarian wisdom motif). Later, in the 4th century, the religious character of Greek art and literature had to be artificially forgotten in order for it to survive in form and to serve the new faith in instruction.

Without even attempting to encompass the entire vexed and vast issue comprehensively, or to assume that the ancient value system could ever be condensed into a series of brief observations, we may note three important marks of ancient Classical mentality concerning what is morally (and aesthetically) prescribed. This last vague concept (“ancient Classical mentality”) is taken here as broadly as possible in terms of periodisation (8th century bce till the 4th or 5th centuries ce), geography (Greek and Latin speaking world, mainly Mediterranean and in areas where cultural Greek and Roman influence extended) and the agents/social strata involved (from various sectors and groups, mostly from free members of society).18 The first of these three characteristics is the idea of balance, whereby a balance of character is to be achieved between extremes, deemed as vices. This line of thought is most characteristic of the Platonic idea of (mild, not utter) suppression of passions/irrational side by reason19 or the Aristotelian 16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nReligion: Thomas Harrison, “Greek Religion and Literature”, in Daniel Ogden (ed.), A Companion to Greek Religion (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell 2007) 373–84. See Mary Beard, John North and Simon Price, Religions of Rome, Vol. 1: A History (Cambridge University Press 1996) 4: “Judged by our own Standards of historical ‘accuracy’, these ancient accounts of early Rome and its religion are inadequate and misleading”; 9: “Some of the documents … are almost certainly fictional reconstructions or inventions”.

One might say that this idea has a classical formulation in the dictum written on the Delphic temple of Apollo: meden agan (‘nothing in excess’). Vice would generally be construed as the opposite of this balance, but in certain unique contexts and circumstances it is the un-balanced which is admired and noteworthy; this is as a rule applies to mythological situations and heroes, who almost by definition have to be “larger than life” figures and serve as models because of their uniqueness. The second sign of virtue entails completeness, both in the sense of excluding partiality or isolation (unity) and in the sense of fulfillment of nature (entirety). This is true of the place of the person in larger units, like his or her family, community and natural surroundings or the cosmos.21 One form of this mark of virtue stresses the completeness of life-span.22 This attitude also\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nSee Terry Penner, “The Unity of Virtue”, Philosophical Review 82 (1973) 35–68; John M.

As above, there were instances where it was the incomplete or the fragmentary which was underscored as virtuous, having ideological or artistic significance. One famous example is the Olympieum, or the Temple of Olympian Zeus, in the city of Athens, begun by the Peisistratids, around 520 bce. Only the platform and columns were completed when Hippias was ousted (510 bce) and work on it was discontinued. For centuries (till the reign of Hadrian in the 2nd century ce), the foundations of the Temple of Zeus were still laid bare and unfinished, a memory of the failed Athenian tyranny.23 A third aspect of ancient virtue concerns the notion of happiness (eudaimonia) as the aim of life.24 Virtue was considered linked with happiness, whether as a necessary and sufficient requirement to attain it (Plato’s Socrates; the Stoics who believed virtue to be identical with happiness); necessary, but with insufficient means to attain it (Aristotle); generating it (Epicurus) or its major constituent (Plato).25 One unique aspect to the ancient moral thought is\n\n23 24 25\n\nprudently goes together with living pleasurably see Letter to Menoeceus 132, Principal Doctrines 5, 20–21.

The extreme position of the Stoics (Diog. Laert. 7.89, 127–8) ignored the value of external goods, as health, wealth or friends to obtain happiness, and cast them as “indifferents” (adiaphora): Cic.

Aristotle emphasised the significance\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe use of the model of the virtuous; that is, what virtuous behaviour the virtuous agent (“the wise man”) would adopt in order to be happy. There were certainly other moral theories and popular approaches which tended to disregard these precepts and to adopt an intentionally contrary and provocative position. For instance the so-called Cynic, Cyrenaic or Sceptic schools, either challenged the idea of balance and completeness or denied that happiness is the end of life (and that virtue is required for it).26 Whether intellectually or psychologically stimulated, these attitudes are to be seen as confrontationally introduced against the background of the three earlier ­notions,\n\n26\n\nof these external elements: en 1099b5-6; see Julia Annas, “Aristotle on Virtue and Happiness”, in Nancy Sherman (ed.), Aristotle’s Ethics: Critical Essays (Lanham, md: Rowman & Littlefield, 1999) 35–56. See Zeno’s definition of happiness as the “good flow of life” (Stob. Ecl. 2.77.20–1). For Epicurus, happiness was in the freedom from pain and distress (an endurable state of detached tranquility = ataraxia), and a by-result for the virtuous life of pleasure: Letter to Menoeceus, 122, 129–130, 132; Diog. Laert. 10.138. This freedom from anxiety will outweigh bodily pain (see Diog. Laert. 10.22, 118; Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 3.41). See Annas (1987) 5–21. In his Republic, Plato attempts to show that the just is happier: see Richard D. Parry, “The Unhappy Tyrant and the Craft of Inner Rule” in Giovanni R.F. Ferrari (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Plato’s Republic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007) 386–414. See Donald Morrison, “The Happiness of the City and the Happiness of the Individual in Plato’s Republic”, Ancient Philosophy 21 (2001) 1–24. Even the Cynic school asserted that virtue, in living according to nature, i.e., simple life, is conducive to happiness (Diog. Laert. 6.70-71). Cf. Max. Tyr. Diss. 3.9; cf. Dio Chr. 6.8-15. William Desmond, Cynics (Stocksfield: Acumen, 2008) 149, 157–8, 161. Thus, Diogenes the Cynic preferred nature against convention (Diog. Laert. 6.22, 6.38, 6.54, 6.71-2 etc.); see Desmond (2008) 71–161. Cf. Farrand Sayre, The Greek Cynics (Baltimore, MD: J.H. Furst Company, 1948) 68–83 on the legend of Diogenes. The Pyrrhonian Sceptics called for an epistemic suspension of judgment about what is good by nature (Diog. Laert. 9.62), and thus adopted and avoided certain cultural dogmatic precepts only as they appeared (Diog. Laert. 9.108, Sext. Emp. Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.21-24). See Mark McPherran, “Ataraxia and Eudaimonia in Ancient Pyrrhonism: Is the Sceptic Really Happy?” Proceedings of the Boston Area Colloquium in Ancient Philosophy 5 (1989) 135–71; id. “Pyrrhonism’s Arguments against Value”, Philosophical Studies 60 (1990) 127–42; Gisela Striker, “Ataraxia: Happiness as Tranquillity”, Monist 73 (1990) 97–110. The Cyrenaics aimed at satisfying the immediate, particular pleasures (Diog. Laert. 2.87), and not at happiness per se, which was at best the by-product or the sum of these pleasures (Ath. 12.544a; Eus. pe 14.18.31). See Terence H. Irwin, “Aristippus against Happiness”, The Monist 74 (1991) 55–82; cf. the opposite view of Voula Tsouna, “Is There an Exception to Greek Eudaemonism?”, in Monique Canto-Sperber and Pierre Pellegrin (eds.), Le style de la pensée (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2002) 464–89.

To these features of the Classical ancient thought, we should add ancient Jewish attitude and thought, which are also included in the present study of reception. Again, the concept “Jewish” should be taken as broadly as possible, as a belief and cult system that ultimately stems from the divine commandments prescribed in the Bible, especially the ethical Decalogue (Exodus 20:2–17, Deuteronomy 5:6–21).27 It applies to Jews in the areas mentioned above, as well as in territories of the Achaemenid and Sassanian Persian Empires or the Seleucid and Parthian kingdoms in the east; the locations relevant to this volume would be the Land of Israel, Egyptian Alexandria and Babylon (broadly defined), and the period is that of the so called Second Temple era (largely extended to cover the years 516 bce to 135 ce).28 The notions of virtue and vice applicable here ultimately go to the biblical injunctions and their interpretations in the period signaling the beginning of Rabbinic literature.29 This introduction of the ancient Jewish example into discussions of reception of antiquity thus broadens the concept of the “Classical”. On this point, it should also be noted that this is far from new. Hellenized Jews (especially from Alexandria) attempted to find parallels and points of contact between Jewish beliefs and the ethics, if not the\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\nAgain, the literature is vast.

For pre-exilic ethics, see the classic treatment of Max Weber, Ancient Judaism (Trans. and ed. H.H. Gerth And D. Martindale) (New York: Free Press, 1952) 235–50. This period saw the intense debate between the Pharisees and Sadducees religious sects centered on the question of authority and values. While the former claimed that the Oral Law was part of the Mosaic Law, equal to the written one (cf. Talmud, Bava Batra 12b; Yoma 80a; Menachot 35a), the latter have been typically portrayed as considering obligatory only the observances which are contained in the Torah (Josephus, Ant. 13.10.6). See Lee I. Levine, “The Political Struggle between Pharisees and Sadducees in the Hasmonean Period”, in Aharon Oppenheimer, Uriel Rappaport, and Menahem Stern (eds.), Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, Abraham Schalit Memorial Volume (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute/ Ministry of Defence, 1980) 61–83. Out of the ruins of the Second Temple in the year 70 ce emerged a new Judaism, which had to come to terms with the crisis in spiritual renewal, which initiated the Midrashic, Mishnaic and Talmudic literature.

What exactly is the relation between the past and the present in Classical Reception Studies? One approach would privilege the past, and interpret modern modes of reception as merely influenced by the past event. This approach lays weight on the historical settings of that moment in the past (historicism); among its assumptions would be that the paths to the ancient period are given, and that the past can be established as it really was (positivism), before tracing its influence on the later period.31 On the other extreme there lies the view that privileges the present (presentism, as Martindale calls it).32 According to this approach, the past always changes in accordance with the current modern perceptions, which are in a better position to lend it its real significance.33 According to the former view, the concept of “modern” may in a narrow sense simply 30\n\nThus, in the Letter to Aristeas (2nd century bc), the Jewish Law (Torah) is said to moderate action, which is taken to signify “the middle course”, “the best course to pursue” (122); it enhances principles of piety and righteousness (131), promote pure contemplation of the one God (158–160, 286) and dietary laws which are aimed to advance thought on the meaning of life (154); the Torah is designed to promote justice, and the Bible has not been written thoughtlessly or without due reason (168). See Victor Tcherikover, “The Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas”, Harvard Theological Review 51 (1958) 59–85. Philo of Alexandria (d. c. ad 50) adapted the Platonic idea of soul likened to the divine (Philo, Leg. 2. 95; Det. 29; Ebr. 70; Her. 84; Mut. 184; Somn. 1. 34), confined inside the material body and whose goal is to return to its source through the moral instruction found in the bible, interpreted allegorically (e.g., Abraham, the immigrant symbolising the departure from sensuality to reason: De Migratione Abrahami, 4) to commend life in agreement with nature. See David T. Runia, “God and man in Philo of Alexandria”, JThS 39 (1988) 48–75. 31 See the criticism of Charles Martindale, Redeeming the Text: Latin Poetry and the Hermeneutics of Reception (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1993). 32 See Martindale (2006) 3, 5. 33 William W. Batstone, “Provocation: The Point of Reception Theory”, in Martindale and ­Thomas (2006) (eds.), Classics and the Uses of Reception (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006) 19: “while the material text remains the same, the received text always changes”. See Kennedy (2006) 289: “The writer’s text is refashioned in its reception in the name of understanding”; 290: “The effect of this is to grant an epistemological confidence to the here and\n\n12\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nmean the accidental feature of its postdating the ancient, being postclassical, and the recent period under consideration (from the Latin modo, modernus). According to the latter approach, there is something unique to the modern era which defines itself by the notion of newness or novelty, in areas of technology or scientific progress. This feature marks this period as better.34 One well known understanding of the modern period as allegedly superior to the past is its association with notion of “secular”.35 Yet, this association does not necessarily imply “better” and it may not be the only one. The present volume is concerned with the culture that has emerged in Europe and America and hence described as “Western”.36 When we speak of modern Western civilisation, we have to concede that according to one dominant view, its origins come from principles held by pious followers of the sacred books and from the injunctions or stories told within them (the so called “Judeo-Christian” precepts, which go back to the example of Hellenized Jews mentioned above).37\n\n34 35\n\n36\n\n37\n\nnow in relation to the past”. Kennedy connects this view with realism, the belief that there is a “real” meaning in the ancient text, hidden but “discovered” in the act of reception. In the terminology of Martindale (2006) 8, it “supersedes” the past. See Kennedy (2006) 289: “supersedes” suggests “later and superior”, maybe even “later and thereby superior”. This was a belief common among leading 19th (and 20th) century intellectuals like Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud, namely, that with the features of modernity (bureaucratisation, rationalisation, waning of the community, scientific progress, advancement in technology, the rise of education or urbanisation), religion will universally and increasingly weaken and lose its authority, social power and cultural importance, and religious beliefs, practices or religiosity will fade in face of rationality. See Steve Bruce, Religion and Modernization: Sociologists and Historians Debate the Secularization Thesis (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992) 170–194. Cf. Charles Wright Mills, The Sociological Imagination (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1959) 32–33 (brought by Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart, Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2004) 3): “Once the world was filled with the sacred—in thought, practice, and institutional form. After … the forces of modernization swept across the globe and secularization, a corollary historical process, loosened the dominance of the sacred. In due course, the sacred shall disappear altogether except, possibly, in the private realm”. See Jeffrey Cox, “Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe”, Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte 14 (2001) 24–35.

The concept “Jewish-Christian” is already found in the 17th century (William Rathband’s A Briefe Narration of Some Church Courses held in opinion and practise in the churches lately erected in New England (London, 1644), described as “one bride”, cf. Rev. 19:7), but\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nIndeed, among the interesting variants of the secularisation theory, the model of Karl Löwith stresses that progress is in fact a secularisation of these Jewish and Christian beliefs: “philosophy of history is … entirely dependent on theology of history, in particular on the theological concept of history as a history of fulfillment and salvation”,38 so that there is no rupture between the modern mind and the past, although there is a break between paganism and Jewish-Christian faith.39 This model still presents a linear scheme concerning modernity, in which there is an unbreakable chain between our modern western culture and its beginnings (Jewish/Christian in Löwith’s scheme) in ancient times. An alternative model would be that proposed by Hans Blumenberg, to the effect that the modern and ancient (coupled with medieval) cultures are two distinct and independent epochs, without historical continuity, the modern characterised by a reaction to theological absolutism.40 Löwith and Blumenberg therefore display two variants of “presentism”, but define the notion of “present” differently and draw the dividing line between the epochs at different points. The concept of “popularity” adds another dimension to the understanding of the relation between the past and the present. It has two aspects which should be considered. One is formal, the means which enables widespread access to a varied and manifold people (populus). Modernity has introduced various sophisticated modes of communication and transportation, which make it distinct from ancient, pre-modern channels of interaction.41 One notable means is the use of mass media (newspapers, film, theater, radio, t­ elevision, Internet gained currency in the 19th century as a theological term, and a cultural and ethical significance in the 20th.

The massive participation in or reaction to art works/events have changed the very notion of “popular” to be flexible and all-­encompassing, so that sometimes the very presence of an artefact in a context which in theory could be reachable to a wide audience makes it popular, regardless of actual figures of spectators.44 It was this aspect that came under attack in the moral criticism of the Neo Marxist Frankfurt School, which even used the terms “culture industry” and “mass culture” instead of “popular culture”. This was because in their opinion, the current culture did not come from the people, but was rather manufactured, market-tested and spread in the interest of capitalist market mechanism, by means of manipulating mass consciousness.45 A different view was introduced by Walter Benjamin,46 who saw popular culture as a positive development, in that the masses’ accessibility made the exclusive “aura” component accompanying works of art disappear, and thus no longer limited to the hands of higher social classes; this process was regarded as tantamount to a democratisation of arts and the liberation of imagination. The second aspect concerns the content of the popular work or event. In order for its substance to be accessible and understandable to as many people as possible, the content should be simplified. In the field of reception, it signifies that the message has to be clear and direct for it to reach its audience. This fact means that some complexity is lost by an appeal to the lower common denominator. This trait accounts for the aspect of visualisation and a­ ccessibility, 42 43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\nSee Ken Ward, Mass Communication and the Modern World (London: Palgrave, 1989) 1­ 0–12, 25–26, 39–40, 49–50, 58–60, 128, 137, 142, 184.

Gel. na 19.8.15), to be discussed in modern new contexts and as received by less privileged groups.52 Without commenting on the political or moral side of popularity introduced by mass media, it is our belief that there is in fact no grim vision of lowering of standards in culture when it comes to Classical reception: while the spectators/readers may not all be familiar with nuances of the classical allusions, they may be aware of the reference; similarly, while some form of complexity is lost, another is 47\n\nCf.

Hence, the study of the reception of the Classical world in popular culture is an intellectually enriching and fascinating field.53 The classical heritage remains pivotal, and indeed in many modern examples, the issue of belonging to Western cultural heritage is central. As we shall see in the studies presented in our volume, the question of belonging appears in various forms in the subject matter of the adaptations and is reflected in the very media, involving the participation or appreciation of the spectators/ readers. Nevertheless, there is more than one way of studying the interactions of the ancient and modern value systems.54 One means of research is tracing a diachronic or developmental process from the old era to the modern popular one, however intricate this historical approach might be. Historicism properly belongs here, as the focus is on the original past moment of the creation and the subsequent history as stemming from it. The “tradition” approach may easily fit in here as well.55 The second is by a synchronic comparison, which takes into account “ideal types” (to use a Weberian sociological notion)56 of the two cultures (the old and 53\n\nPeter Burke, “The classical tradition and popular culture in early modern Europe”, in Les intermédiaires culturels: actes du Colloque du Centre méridional d’histoire social, des mentalités et des cultures, 1978 (Aix-en-Provencem 1981) 237–44; Siobhán McElduff, “Fractured Understanding: Towards a History of Classical Reception Among Non-Elite Groups”, in Martindale and Thomas (2006) 180–191. 54 See Hardwick and Stray (2008a) 5. 55 Note the image of Highet (1949) 541: “We have traced the river of Greek and Roman influence in literature”. The river flows in one direction only. 56 According to Weber, the ideal type (Idealtypus) is a generic concept, a clear model, which is formed by the one-sided accentuation of a certain point of view which arranges many concrete individual phenomena into one, unified construct (Gedankenbild). It is a concept which relates to phenomena with value or meaning (to ideas believed to exist in a certain particular culture), complicated historical patterns, and as such not subsumed under laws. This heuristic analytical tool is not to be found in reality, but in proximity to it; as an ideal limiting concept, reality is compared with it to gain understanding of the uniqueness and significance of cultural events.

This last method does not imply a cyclical historical perception known in antiquity,57 or a “natural” approach to civilisation introduced by Spengler or Toynbee,58 in which cultures are the same in that they begin, rise, reach their apex and then decline and disappear. The latter approaches, however, may be interesting to think with, given the (temporal) gap between the two sets of values, the analogical parallels which are found in the comparison between them, and the focus on the receiving culture and not on any cross-cultural “tradition”. In a way, this comparative approach goes well with “presentism”. The model to be prescribed in Classical Reception Studies is perhaps a combination of these two, which provides us with a “golden mean”, as it were.59 The scholarly field deals not only with the manner ancient images and texts are disseminated in modern culture, but also with the way these very images and texts are transformed, and are in constant change, because of this dissemination.60 There is a reciprocal dimension between the ancient and modern that exists in the reception of the Classical world, by which the gap between the two worlds 57\n\nE.g., Thuc. 1.22.4, 3.82.2, Plat.

Spengler denied a diachronic approach to the relation between cultures, in which one is trying to absorb alien ideas from another (which he termed as “historical pseudomorphosis”, 2.189–94). Toynbee has 21 civilisations, each with a similar pattern of rise, decline (when faced with external and internal threats) and fall; yet, he seems to hope there is a way (for man or God) to break the cycle.

Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger (eds.), The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983).\n\n18\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nis largely diminished.61 The way modern society treats the distant culture of the past resembles an “ethnographic” investigation and the “translation” of one society to the other. Since one feature of ethnography is that of perspective and vantage point,62 and since descriptions are always told of one group from the viewpoint of the other, theoretically, the two sides can interchange, so that one group objectified in an “etic” account can in its turn describe the other.63 The combined approaches of presentism and historicism may be analogically presented in an interesting interpretation of Plutarch’s Parallel Lives (Paralleloi Bioi), in which a hero from Greek history (or mythology) is paired with one from Roman history (or mythology). In one sense, the two Lives, which artistically should be read as one work, imply a diachronic approach, as most pairs begin with the previous Greek protagonist and move on to the Roman one, thereby signalling the heritage of Greece in Rome. In the transition between the two, we see how the Greek hero is received in Rome (for instance, Alexander by Caesar, Demosthenes by Cicero). Yet, the two Lives are also separate, and insinuate a repetition of history in the recurrence of character.64 In another important sense, the two Lives present a unified Greco-Roman culture (since the Romans adopt and absorb Greek culture and paideia in various degrees), thus displaying the two histories as part of the same tradition, same set of values (in the same Greek moral vocabulary, yet still varied according to ethnicity) and the same components of the imperial identity.65 Moreover, 61 See Martindale (2006) 5: “Antiquity and modernity, present and past, are always implicated in each other, always in dialogue”. See Hardwick and Stray (2008a) 5: “dialogical relationships between reception and the analysis of the ancient contexts … the relationship between ancient and modern is reciprocal” See James I. Porter, “Reception studies: Future prospects”, in Lorna Hardwick and Christopher Stray (eds.), A Companion to Classical Receptions (Malden, ma: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008b) 469–81, who speaks of the constant change of the objects of reception: “Traditions of reception are dynamic processes that flow in two directions at once, both forward and backward” [474]. 62 Cf. John D. Brewer, Ethnography (Buckingham: Open University Press, 2000) 49–50; Mike Crang and Ian Cook, Doing Ethnographies (London: Sage Publications Limited, 2007) 5–16. 63 Attempts at an ironic inverted ethnography are probably as old as these depictions themselves. They can be seen in Herodotus (Hdt. 7.9, cf. 7.102) or Lucian (Anach. 6). 64 For Plutarch’s complex views of history see Simon Swain, “Plutarch: Chance, Providence, and History”, AJPh 110 (1989) 272–302; Jackson P. Hershbell, “Plutarch’s Concept of History: Philosophy from Examples”, AnSoc 28 (1997) 241–43. 65 See the section entitled “Two Peoples-One Culture”, in Simon Swain, Hellenism and Empire: Language, Classicism, and Power in the Greek World ad 50–250 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996) 137–44, focusing on the Parallel Lives, which contain the most obvious expression of “the notion of comparability between Greece and Rome”. See also 9, 143, 418–20. For the aim of displaying a composite picture of Greco-Roman “global history” in the Lives see Christopher B.R. Pelling, “Plutarch’s ‘Tale of Two Cities’: Do the Parallel Lives\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe two heroes may display a joint personality, each highlighting positive and negative traits, which together make an ethical model to be followed (an AlexanderCaesar or a DemosthenesCicero, so to speak).66 This is a model worth considering in Reception Studies, in which both the old and modern cultures are not treated as entirely separate, but as co-existing and affecting each other. In this model, both the historically old and the present sets of values share in the creation of the identity of the modern person who also acknowledges the significance of the past in today’s world.67\n\nAncient Virtues and Vices in Modern Popular Culture\n\nThe impetus for the conference from which this book developed was a growing recognition that ancient Greece and Rome (as well as ancient Judaism and Christianity) are rarely depicted objectively in modern popular culture, and that these ancient cultures are idealised and glorified, or demonised, according to the constantly changing needs and attitudes and the contemporary society that produces that interpretation. Our starting point was to reflect on how relevant the ancient past is to modern society, both as the heritage from which modern beliefs have evolved, and as a medium for projecting contemporary visions, not only about the ancient world, but also about ourselves. As society changes, so its ideas of morality, vice and virtue change, and depictions of the ancient world, now laden with new meanings, are one of the vehicles used to convey these altering values. Accordingly, the papers in this volume address the place of ancient morality and ancient values in modern popular culture in two contexts. The first context is the appearance of ancient virtues and vices within forms of mimetic\n\n66\n\n67\n\ncombine as global histories?” in Noreen Humble (ed.), Plutarch’s Lives: Parallelism and Purpose (Swansea: Classical Press of Wales 2010) 217: “… the Lives do come together to depict ‘global history’ … [b]ut that history is valuable not for its own sake, but for the light it sheds on the individuals …”.

Addressing the formal comparisons (synkriseis) Boulogne proposes that they are to present an ideal picture of a “third man”, combining the two excellences of the two heroes. Thus, the paired statesmen display two embodiments of the same soul of interpersonal “self”. This may be related to Martindale’s use of Plutarch and his claim (2006) 10–11: “Plutarch could be truly alive again for us, other than as part of a purely historical inquiry … for some reader who dares break through the Zeitgeist, somewhere, who knows? Plutarch might yet change the world again”.\n\n20\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nperformance, which re-enact the past, as it were, in the present. The first section in the first part deals with performances on stage, and the second section is concerned with the media of the screen, namely, cinema and television. The structure of the first part thus moves from a rather direct representation of the action before a relatively small audience to mass media, which involve larger crowds and in which the relationship of the action and the audience is indirect. Thus, the media addressed in the first part progress with respect of the popularity involved. It is surely no wonder that the reception of ancient values in modern performance on stage, the subject matter of the first three studies of this volume, can be more easily traced, since the medium is not new and has close connections with ancient theatrical presentation, making the contrast with modern morality more evident. Thus, in the first chapter, Lisa Maurice examines stagings of the Oresteia over the last two and a half decades, demonstrating how issues such as translation, adaptation and staging are used to promote agendas that address contemporary attitudes. Showing how different elements are emphasised as virtues or vices in accordance with current ideas, Maurice traces the influence of feminism, warfare, imperialism and fears about changing values, through the varying depictions of the House of Atreus, topics which reflect on the understanding of the Oresteia. Similarly, Hannah Roisman investigates in her study the strengths and flaws of Thornton Wilder’s play, The Alcestiad or A Life in the Sun, showing how his attempt to infuse it with Kierkegaardian philosophy leads to a subordination of character and plot that weakens the production. Thus, ironically, this rendition of the tale of sacrifice, retold by Wilder with overtones of a modern morality, sacrifices plot and characters, thereby leaving the work with little moral punch or impact. Ariadne Konstantinou shows how the Greek playwright Margarita Liberaki, in her play Candaules’ Wife, uses the Herodotean episode of Candaules, his wife and Gyges, to create a play that is a vehicle for tackling contemporary issues of gender and myth in the modern society of post-war Greece. This chapter thus plays upon the modern attempt to marry the ancient medium of the poetic drama with an ancient theme of prosaic historiography. Broadly speaking, this group of studies point at the artistic practice of instilling new content in an old form, and more precisely, of turning an ancient moralistic context into a modern moralistic product, with varying degrees of sophistication, while interweaving the old and the new. The second section in the first part of the volume is more firmly rooted in the modern period, since by definition the medium addressed is a more recent invention. The six studies included in this section progress from m ­ odern\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nr­ eception of ancient texts to modern reception of ancient characters and ideas, thus paving the way towards the more notional forms of reception in Part ii. The first four studies deal with the classical Greco-Roman world, while the last two tackle Christian Biblical reality and stories. The first chapter is ostensibly a simple case of reception. Eran Almagor looks at Walter Hill’s movie The Warriors (1979), based on Sol Yurick’s novel of the same name (1965), and more importantly on Xenophon’s Anabasis. The fact that both the ancient work and the novel are significant for the understanding of the movie is demonstrated in various manners, and also by an examination of the moralistic themes noticeable in the movie and its depiction of heroes and villains. Examining how the three works interact with each other, Almagor shows how the virtues and vices of Xenophon’s original protagonists are reconstructed by both Yurick and Hill, and reinterpreted against the background of ancient and modern ideas of individualism and community. Thus, through the combined study of the two works, the ancient text and the new modern interpretation receive layers of meaning not immediately observable by the separate audiences. The next two cases address not a specific ancient text, but ancient stories. These stories are found in a group of ancient texts which respectively created images of a (semi-)divine hero and a mortal hero, namely, Hercules and Oedipus. The chapter of Emma Stafford looks at the well-known late fifth-century tale told by Prodicus of Ceos. This is the story of Hercules’ choice between two ways of life—symbolised by female figures who personify Virtue and Vice. Stafford demonstrates how the tale has exercised an unconscious influence on the genre of the peplum (or sword-and-sandal) movie. Stafford focuses on four movies, two by Pietro Francisci—Le fatiche di Ercole (1958) and Ercole e la regina di Lidia (1959)—as well as Vittorio Cottafavi’s Ercole alla Conquista di Atlantide (1961) and Giorgio Capitani’s Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus gli invincibile (1964). Continuing and representing the ancient image of Prodicus, Hercules is depicted in these cinematic artifacts as facing a choice between the paths of virtue and vice, each path being embodied by a female figure. Some of Woody Allen’s films and movie segments based upon Greek tragedies are studied in Anna Foka’s chapter. The end result of these modern interpretations is a reconstruction of the myths, a dismantling of Classical Hellenic culture and a rearrangement intended for a modern 20th century (mostly New York) setting. In this manner, the Greek tragic content is transformed into a contemporary moral context, in which the comic is enhanced and with which a Jewish setting is merged. Emma Southon’s chapter turns from Greece to Imperial Rome. Southon considers two different depictions of Caligula and Drusilla: the 1976 bbc\n\n22\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\n­adaptation of Robert Graves’s I, Claudius (1934) and the controversial pornographic movie Caligula (1979). The chapter shows the manner in which the modern popular fictional depiction develops ancient innuendos and suggestive images, brings to the fore implicit notions and thus complicates the moral problems of the ancient texts. In his chapter, Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones outlines the historical reception of the figure of Salome on screen, and focuses on the portrayal of the character by Rita Hayworth in Salome (1953). Llewellyn-Jones demonstrates how the superficial morality of Hollywood star system and Hayworth’s virginal depiction of Salome, a necessary by-product of the actress’ wholesome image, conflicted with the historical tradition, influenced by Greek historiographic motifs, and the moral import of the ancient story found in the Greek biblical text. Panayiota Mini’s chapter, which concludes the first part of the volume, addresses an ancient image rather than an ancient text in two popular representations rather than one. She examines two landmark epic movies and shows how the portrayal of the female leads in The Sign of the Cross (1932) and Quo Vadis (1951) reflects important shifts in the popular discourse on female virtue in two eras of American history, the Great Depression and the aftermath of World War ii. This study in the development of modern moral ideals and values with ancient themes as the backdrop for such an exploration brings us to the second part of the volume. In all the case studies of this section we may see how old content is incorporated in a new medium and is transformed thereby. The second part of the book looks at ways in which ancient vices and virtues help shape contemporary ideas and contemporary existence. The studies in this section relate to modern moral notions and values in which the ancient world is not seen as a dead past but rather as continuing to live within modern experience. It is divided into two parts, each with three chapters, concerned with modern Greek and Jewish perspectives respectively. This division in itself highlights the tension between Judaism and ancient Greece, with “Hellenism” (in the sense of adopting the Hellenic system of values), being seen as opposed to the Jewish set of values, an important notion in the religious identity of ancient Jewish existence and a concept which still finds currency today. The first chapter in this part addresses the complex and contemporary volatile issue of Macedonian identity. Maria Pretzler deals with the influence of ancient rhetoric and images on modern cinematic depictions of Philip ii and Alexander the Great, and thus provides a link between this section and the previous one. Pretzler uses the fascinating question of the portrayal of ancient Macedonia as between barbarian and Greek values in Robert Rossen’s Alexander the Great (1956), Oliver Stone’s Alexander (2004) and the tv miniseries directed by Peter Sykes, The Search for Alexander the Great (1981). In her study,\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nPretzler addresses contemporary attitudes and observes the effect of the excavations in the two royal Macedonian c​ ities of Pella and Aigai and the political upheavals surrounding the area as a result of the dispute between Greece and the now independent, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In the next chapter, Luca Asmonti examines how the topos of the Greek origins of European values has been with relation to Greece’s admittance into, and role within, the European Union. Asmonti shows how the very notion of democracy as an underlying and central value of the European Union, was flagged by Greece in the process of her entry into the European community, being the birthplace of democracy. Further, Asmonti goes beyond Greece to show the relevance of classical Athens to the modern crisis-ridden European Union, as an extraordinary model of a political space of outspoken debate and confrontation. In the final chapter of this section, Aggeliki Koumanoudi looks at the reception and continuation of Greek religious ideals and values in modern day Greece. Outlining the portrayals of the Greek God Pan in festivals and carnivals, as well as the adoption of the god by secret societies and even by political figures, Koumanoudi shows that the pagan deity is still alive and well in the modern world, where he is exploited, as he has always been, for his qualities that may be regarded variously as virtues or vices. The last three chapters address the reception of ancient Jewish values in modern Judaism and in Israel. Second Temple Judaism (a term broadly understood here) has dealt with the surrounding pagan (mostly Greek) society, culture, religion and values in two ways: a partial or entire assimilation and debate or confrontation. These two manners can be seen in the studies presented here. We start with reception modes which largely assimilate ancient Jewish traditions, memories and notions of virtue and vice to modern values. Here, more than the counterpart reception of ancient Hellenic culture and values in modern Greece, the Jewish or Israeli reception of ancient Judaism at times involves an outright and visible reversal of the ancient values. Thus, David Schaps looks at the transformation of the ancient Maccabees into Jewish musclemen and heroes in recent history. Looking at various receptions and incarnations of the Maccabees, particularly in light of Zionism, he argues that the varied depictions in the modern world each reflect the pressures and requirements of individual Jewish communities in contemporary environment. Haim Weiss, following a similar trajectory, examines the reception of the figure of Bar-Kosibah (or Bar Kochba), the leader of the Jewish revolt against Rome (132–135 ce). Weiss demonstrates the theological, nationalistic, and political significance of the depiction of this person as having unique p ­ hysical\n\n24\n\nAlmagor and Maurice\n\nprowess, from ancient rabbinic times to contemporary popular literature, showing that the early rabbinical ambivalence to Bar-Kosibah is toned down in contemporary popular discourse, as he consciously became a model for the modern, strong “warrior” Jew. Finally, Gabriel Danzig examines the reception of a disputation concerning the respective values of Judaism and paganism, between Rabbi Akivah and Tineius (Turnus) Rufus, the governor of Judaea during the period leading up to the Bar-Kosibah / Bar-Kokhba revolt. Danzig discusses both the reception of Tineius Rufus and this debate in ancient Jewish literature (mostly the Talmud) and in modern day Israel. Danzig argues that both sets of receptions stem from attacks by hostile foreign nations who were depicted as polar opposites of Judaism, but also that the attacks themselves on Jewish practices influenced the response in similar ways, stimulating Jewish thinkers to be creative in their efforts to find intellectual justifications for their practices. It is with this study concerning ancient and modern receptions that we choose to end this section and indeed the volume. Not only does it show that the occupation with the ancient past and values is relevant to modern notions of identity and popular morality, but it also demonstrates the modern awareness of this very reception. Indeed, one of issues presented in the debate in the final chapter (concerning Jewish circumcision) addresses the merits of an original form (here, of nature) vs. an adapted form (conventional practice), a variant of the physis vs. nomos debate, as it were. Arguments have been voiced on both sides. Yet, the merit of the adaptation, revision or variation should not be discarded. We believe that this volume shows the value of the study of popular reception of ancient values, and the virtues of Reception Studies as a legitimate scholarly field.
