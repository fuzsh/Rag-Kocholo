Paul\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective Influenza-associated deaths in healthy children that were reported during the 2003â2004 influenza season heightened the public awareness of the seriousness of influenza in children. In 1996â1998, a pivotal phase III trial was conducted in children who were 15 to 71 months of age. Live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent (LAIV-T), was shown to be safe and efficacious. In a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LAIV-T trial in children who were 1 to 17 years of age, a statistically significant increase in asthma encounters was observed for children who were younger than 59 months. LAIV-T was not licensed to children who were younger than 5 years because of the concern for asthma. We report on the largest safety study to date of the recently licensed LAIV-T in children 18 months to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, and 10 to 18 years of age in a 4-year (1998â2002) community-based trial that was conducted at Scott & White Memorial Hospital and Clinic (Temple, TX). Methods An open-label, nonrandomized, community-based trial of LAIV-T was conducted before its licensure. Medical records of all children were surveyed for serious adverse events (SAEs) 6 weeks after vaccination. Health care utilization was evaluated by determining the relative risk (RR) of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) and asthma rates at 0 to 14 and 15 to 42 days after vaccination compared with the rates before vaccination. Medical charts of all visits coded as asthma were reviewed for appropriate classification of events: acute asthma or other. We evaluated the risk for MAARI (health care utilization for acute respiratory illness) 0 to 14 and 15 to 42 days after LAIV-T by a method similar to the postlicensure safety analysis conducted on measles, mumps, and rubella and on diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis vaccines. Results All children regardless of age were administered a single intranasal dose of LAIV-T in each vaccine year.

The role of genetic confounding and of potential environmental intermediaries, such as bullying, in any associations is unclear. To compare trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 10 to 18 years for children with or without ASD and autistic traits, to assess associations between ASD and autistic traits and an International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) depression diagnosis at age 18 years, and to explore the importance of genetic confounding and bullying. Longitudinal study of participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort in Bristol, United Kingdom, followed up through age 18 years. Data analysis was conducted from January to November 2017. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) at 6 time points between ages 10 and 18 years. An ICD-10 depression diagnosis at age 18 years was established using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised. Exposures were ASD diagnosis and 4 dichotomized autistic traits (social communication, coherence, repetitive behavior, and sociability). An autism polygenic risk score was derived using the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium autism discovery genome-wide association study summary data. Bullying was assessed at ages 8, 10, and 13 years. The maximum sample with complete data was 6091 for the trajectory analysis (48.8% male) and 3168 for analysis of depression diagnosis at age 18 years (44.4% male). Children with ASD and autistic traits had higher average SMFQ depressive symptom scores than the general population at age 10 years (eg, for social communication 5.55 [95% CI, 5.16-5.95] vs 3.73 [95% CI, 3.61-3.85], for ASD 7.31 [95% CI, 6.22-8.40] vs 3.94 [95% CI, 3.83-4.05], remaining elevated in an upward trajectory until age 18 years (eg, for social communication 7.65 [95% CI, 6\n\nRisk factors for mortality before age 18 years in cystic fibrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcColley, Susanna A; Schechter, Michael S; Morgan, Wayne J; Pasta, David J; Craib, Marcia L; Konstan, Michael W\n\n2017-07-01\n\nUnderstanding early-life risk factors for childhood death in cystic fibrosis (CF) is important for clinical care, including the identification of effective interventions. Data from the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) collected 1994-2005 were linked with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) demographic and mortality data from 2013. Inclusion criteria were â¥1 visit annually at age 3-5 years and â¥1 FEV 1 measurement at age 6-8 years. Demographic data, nutritional parameters, pulmonary signs and symptoms, microbiology, and FEV 1 were evaluated as risk factors for death before age 18 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the simultaneous effects of risk factors associated with death before age 18 years. Among 5365 patients enrolled in ESCF who met inclusion criteria, 3880 (72%) were linked to the CFFPR. Among these, 191 (5.7%) died before age 18 years; median age at death was 13.4âÂ±â3.1 years. Multivariable regression showed clubbing, crackles, female sex, unknown CFTR genotype, minority race or ethnicity, Medicaid insurance (a proxy of low socioeconomic status), Pseudomonas aeruginosa on 2 or more cultures, and weight-for-age <50th percentile were significant risk factors for death regardless of inclusion of FEV 1 at age 6-8 years in the model. We identified multiple risk factors for childhood death of patients with CF, all of which remained important after incorporating FEV 1 at age 6-8 years. Among the factors identified were the presence of clubbing or crackles at age 3-5 years, signs which are not routinely collected in registries.

Methods: Through the National ART Information Ssystem, we selected those HIV/AIDS patients who initiated the ART 36 months after the ART, between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 in Guangzhou, Liuzhou and Kunming. Patients were divided into age groups as 18-49, 50-59 and 60 or over year olds, at the baseline of treatment. Under different levels of baseline CD(4) counts, we chose the baseline and different time-point of CD(4) counts as dependent variables, applied mixed linear model to analyze the effects of age, viral suppression, gender, baseline CD(4)/CD(8) ratio and initial treatment regimen. Results: A total of 5 331 HIV/AIDS patients were recruited. No differences were found on age group ratios between different levels of baseline CD(4) counts. At the level of baseline CD(4)<200 cells/Î¼l, both the 50-59 and 60 or above years old groups had lower CD(4) counts than the 18-49 year-old group, within 36 months after the initiation of ART. However, at the baseline CD(4) level of 200-350 cells/Î¼l, no significant differences on CD(4) counts between the 50-59 year-old and 18-49 year-old groups were noticed. CD(4) counts seemed lower in the 60 and above year-old group than in the 18-49 year-old group. Conclusion: Age might serve as an influencing factor on CD(4) counts within 36 months after the initiation of ART, suggesting that earlier initiation of ART might be of help to the recovery of immune function in the 50-59 year-old group.\n\nAge-Adjusted Percentage of Adults Aged 18 Years or Older with Diagnosed Diabetes Performing Daily Self-Monitoring of ...\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

We carried out a secondary analysis of data from 1,944 participants of the 'National Diet and Nutrition Survey: young people aged 4-18 years'. Blood pressure and blood lipid levels were compared in overweight versus non-overweight and high versus low waist circumference groups. Overweight was defined using international cut-offs for body mass index. High waist circumference was defined as >or= 91st percentile of UK waist circumference charts. Analyses were done separately by sex and age group (4-10 and 11-18 years for overweight, and 11-17 years for waist circumference). Overweight and high waist circumference were associated with increased systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and triacylglycerol, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Those who were both overweight and had a high waist circumference had the highest blood pressure, plasma LDLC and triacylglycerol, and the lowest plasma HDLC. Overweight and high waist circumference were associated with increased blood pressure and a less favourable lipid profile. Children who were both overweight and had a high waist circumference had the most unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile. Both measurements may be useful in identifying children with increased health risks.\n\nA cross-sectional study of cryptorchidism in children: testicular volume and hormonal function at 18 years of age\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVarela-Cives, R.; MÃ©ndez-Gallart, R.; Estevez-MartÃ­nez, E.; RodrÃ­guez-Barca, P.; Bautista-Casasnovas, A.; Pombo-Arias, M.; Tojo-Sierra, R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose To evaluate the relationship between unilateral or bilateral criptorchidism, patient age, primary location of the gonad and modality of treatment with testicular volume and hormonal status at 18 years in patients diagnosed and treated for cryptorchidism during childhood. Materials and Methods Testicular volume, LH, FSH, and testosterone were evaluated in 143 young men at 18 years treated in childhood for unilateral (n=103) or bilateral (n=40) cryptorchidism. Results Unilateral cryptorchidism: Location of testis was prescrotal in 36 patients, inguinal in 52 and non-palpable in 15. The mean volume was 9.7 mL compared to 16.2 mL. for the spontaneously descended testicle in unilateral cryptorchidism. However, 22 patients who received HCG had a significantly bigger testis (11.8 mL.) than those treated with primary surgery (9.2 mL). The results showed a significant positive correlation between testicular volume and patient age at treatment. Bilateral cryptorchidism Location of testis was prescrotal in 34 cases, inguinal in 40 and 6 patients with non-palpable testicles. Mean volume at 18 years was 12.9 mL, greater than unilateral cryptorchid testis (9.7 mL) but smaller than healthy contralateral in unilateral cases (16.2 mL). There were significant differences in the testicular growth for bilateral patients with testicular descent after being treated with HCG (14.4 mL) in respect with those untreated (11.1 mL) or those who underwent primary surgery (11.4 mL). There was a significant positive correlation between the testicular volume and palpable (12.4 mL) or non-palpable testis (10.4 mL). There was a correlation between unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism and levels of FSH. Conclusions Testicular volume and hormonal function at 18 years for patients diagnosed and treated for cryptorchidism during childhood are strongly influenced by whether the undescended testis was unilateral or bilateral. Location of the testes at diagnosis or age of initial treatment exerts\n\nAccuracy of Cameriere's cut-off value for third molar in assessing 18 years of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Luca, S; Biagi, R; Begnoni, G; Farronato, G; Cingolani, M; Merelli, V; Ferrante, L; Cameriere, R\n\n2014-02-01\n\nDue to increasingly numerous international migrations, estimating the age of unaccompanied minors is becoming of enormous significance for forensic professionals who are required to deliver expert opinions. The third molar tooth is one of the few anatomical sites available for estimating the age of individuals in late adolescence. This study verifies the accuracy of Cameriere's cut-off value of the third molar index (I3M) in assessing 18 years of age. For this purpose, a sample of orthopantomographs (OPTs) of 397 living subjects aged between 13 and 22 years (192 female and 205 male) was analyzed. Age distribution gradually decreases as I3M increases in both males and females. The results show that the sensitivity of the test was 86.6%, with a 95% confidence interval of (80.8%, 91.1%), and its specificity was 95.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of (92.1%, 98%). The proportion of correctly classified individuals was 91.4%. Estimated post-test probability, p was 95.6%, with a 95% confidence interval of (92%, 98%). Hence, the probability that a subject positive on the test (i.e., I3M<0.08) was 18 years of age or older was 95.6%. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To determine the long-term survival of the ACL graft and the contralateral ACL (CACL) after primary reconstruction in patients aged â¤18 years and to identify the factors that increase the odds of subsequent ACL injuries. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Patients having undergone primary ACL reconstruction at age â¤18 years between 1993 and 1998 who were included in a prospective database by a single surgeon were considered for this study. Single-incision endoscopic ACL reconstruction was performed with either an autologous bone-patellar tendon-bone graft or a hamstring tendon graft. At a minimum of 15 years after ACL reconstruction, patients completed a subjective survey involving the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire in addition to questions regarding current symptoms, further ACL injuries, family history of ACL injury, and current level of activity. A total of 288 adolescents (age range, 13-18 years) met the inclusion criteria, of whom 242 (84%) were reviewed at a mean of 16 years and 6 months after ACL reconstruction. Of these patients, 75 (31%) sustained a further ACL injury: 27 (11.2%) suffered an ACL graft rupture, 33 suffered a CACL injury (13.6%), and 15 sustained both an ACL graft rupture and a CACL injury (6.2%) over 15 years. Survival of the ACL graft was 95%, 92%, 88%, 85%, and 83% at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, and survival of the CACL was 99%, 98%, 90%, 83%, and 81%, respectively. Survival of the ACL graft was less favorable in those with a family history of ACL injury than in those without a family history (69% vs 90%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 3.6; P\n\nReference centile curves for wrist circumference for Indian children aged 3-18 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhadilkar, Vaman; Chiplonkar, Shashi; Ekbote, Veena; Kajale, Neha; Mandlik, Rubina; Khadilkar, Anuradha\n\n2018-01-26\n\nChildhood obesity and its consequences have reached alarming proportions worldwide and in India. Wrist circumference is emerging as an easily measurable reproducible parameter for screening children at risk of obesity-related morbidities such as hypertension and insulin resistance. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compute age and gender-specific wrist circumference percentiles for 3-18-year-old apparently healthy Indian children and adolescents; (2) to assess the relationship of wrist circumference with measures of obesity and adiposity such as body mass index (BMI), fat percentage and blood pressure (BP) and (3) to suggest age and gender-specific cut-offs for wrist circumference percentile for the risk of hypertension in Indian children and adolescents. This was a cross-sectional study on samples of 10,199 3-18-year-old children (5703 boys) from randomly selected schools from five major cities in India. Height, weight, waist and wrist circumference and BP were recorded. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Wrist circumference percentiles were computed using the LMS method. The average wrist circumference of boys and girls was 10.4 cm and 10.0 cm at 3 years and increased to 15.1 cm and 13.9 cm, respectively, at 18 years. Compared to their Caucasian counterparts, Indian children's wrists were smaller. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis derived the 70th percentile of wrist circumference as the cut-off for identifying the risk of hypertension. Contemporary cross-sectional reference percentile curves for wrist circumference for 3-18-year-old Indian children are presented. The 70th percentile of the current study is proposed as the cut-off to screen children for cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension.\n\n[Fruit and vegetables intake among the Chinese migrant population aged 18 to 59 years old in 2012].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Mei; Wang, Linhong; Deng, Qian; Zhao, Yinjun; Huang, Zhengjing; Li, Yichong; Jiang, Yong; Wang, Limin\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo describe the intake of fruit and vegetables among employed migrant population aged 18 to 59 year-olds in China. Data from the Migrant Population Survey related to China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance that conducted in 170 counties/districts in 31 provinces, 2012, was used. Information on non-communicable diseases and related risk factors among migrant population were collected through face-to-face questionnaire interview, physical measurement and lab tests. A total of 48 704 subjects aged 18 to 59 years old were included in our study. Sample was standardized by age and sex. Information on average daily fruit and vegetables intake, prevalence of low fruit and vegetables intake, grouped by sex, age, industries, and education level were analyzed. The average daily intakes of vegetables and fruits were 353.7 (95%CI:351.3-356.2) g and 125.1 (95%CI:123.4-126.9) g respectively, among the employed migrant population aged 18-59 years old in China. Prevalence of low fruit and vegetables intake was 44.1% (95% CI:43.5%-44.6% ) among employed migrant population, 46.2% (95% CI: 45.5%-47.0%)for males and 41.2% (95% CI:40.3%-42.0%)for females (Ï(2) = 82.19, P < 0.05). Among different professions, the prevalence of low fruit and vegetables intake was the highest among people working in accommodation and restaurants (46.2%, 95%CI:45.0%-47.3%) while the lowest seen among those working in social services (42.5%, 95%CI:41.4%-43.7%,Ï(2) = 15.81, P < 0.05). The prevalence of low fruit and vegetables intake showed a decrease along with the increase of education levels (Ï(2) = 22.29, P < 0.05). In 2012, more than 40% of the employed migrant population aged 18 to 59 years old in China had low fruit and vegetables intake. Being male and with low education level were risk factors linked with the higher prevalence of low fruit and vegetables intake.\n\nPap Smear Test Prevalence within Three Years (Age 18+) - Small Area Estimates\n\nCancer.gov\n\nFor Pap smear test, a woman 18 years of age or older must have reported having at least one Pap smear test in her life.

By a planimetric method, we calculated the wear areas on dental casts taken at the ages of five, ten, 14, and 18 years from the dentition of 39 healthy, orthodontically untreated subjects with good morphological occlusion. For young adults, we also studied the association between the amount of wear and reported parafunctions, maximal bite force, salivary buffer capacity, salivary flow rate, and some cephalometric variables. Size of wear facets on all anterior teeth increased with age. Significant correlations were found between the total wear areas of the six anterior primary teeth at five years of age and those of their permanent successors at age 14 (r = 0.44) and 18 (r = 0.39). For an individual, tooth wear at five years of age was, however, of low predictive value for tooth wear in young adulthood, whereas tooth wear at 14 years of age predicted it well (r = 0.89). Highest correlations between tooth wear and background factors at 18 years of age were found for maximal anterior bite force (r = 0.44) and for the size of the gonial angle (r = -0.31). Wear of anterior teeth was not associated with reported parafunctions in young adulthood.\n\nDevelopment of reference equations for spirometry in Japanese children aged 6-18 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakase, Masato; Sakata, Hiroshi; Shikada, Masahiro; Tatara, Katsuyoshi; Fukushima, Takayoshi; Miyakawa, Tomoo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSpirometry is the most widely used pulmonary function test and the measured values of spirometric parameters need to be evaluated using reference values predicted for the corresponding race, sex, age, and height. However, none of the existing reference equations for Japanese children covers the entire age range of 6-18 years. The Japanese Society of Pediatric Pulmonology had organized a working group in 2006, in order to develop a new set of national standard reference equations for commonly used spirometric parameters that are applicable through the age range of 6-18 years. Quality assured spirometric data were collected through 2006-2008, from 14 institutions in Japan. We applied multiple regression analysis, using age in years (A), square of age (A(2)), height in meters (H), square of height (H(2)), and the product of age and height (AH) as explanatory variables to predict forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC (FEF(25-75%)), instantaneous forced expiratory flow when 50% (FEF(50%)) or 75% (FEF(75%)) of the FVC have been expired. Finally, 1,296 tests (674 boys, 622 girls) formed the reference data set. Distributions of the percent predicted values did not differ by ages, confirming excellent fit of the prediction equations throughout the entire age range from 6 to 18 years. Cut-off values (around 5 percentile points) for the parameters were also determined. We recommend the use of this new set of prediction equations together with suggested cut-off values, for assessment of spirometry in Japanese children and adolescents.

To evaluate whether mandibular third molar could be used as an indicator for estimating the age under or over 18 years. The mineralization status of mandibular third molar of 1 845 individuals aged 10 - 30 was graded and marked based on Demirjian's classification of grades reformed by Orhan. Gender difference was examined by t-test. A cubic regression model was established to analyze the correlation between third molar and chronologic age. Each grade of age cumulative distribution diagram and ROC curve was respectively performed to evaluate the relationship between third molar and the age of 18. Using Bayes discriminant analysis, an equation was established for estimating the age of 18. The inner-rater reliability was 0.903. Statistical analysis showed a moderate correlation between age and grade. Significant differences of both genders were found only in grade D and H (P < 0.05). Males at the grades from 1 to D and females at the grades from 1 to C were under 18 years old, and both males and females at grade H were over 18 years old. The area under the ROC curve was 0.797 (P < 0.05). Third molar development shows a high correlation with age, and combined with other indicators, it can be used to estimate the age of 18.\n\nEnterobius vermicularis infection among children aged 1-8 years in a rural area in Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorhayati, M; Hayati, M I; Oothuman, P; Azizi, O; Fatmah, M S; Ismail, G; Minudin, Y M\n\n1994-09-01\n\nThe infection rate and relationship of enterobiasis with socio-economic status were determined in children aged 1-8 years, living in a rural area in Malaysia. Of the 178 subjects 40.4% were infected with Enterobius vermicularis. The distribution of enterobiasis among these children were analyzed in relation to age groups and sex. The rate of infection was significantly higher in older children (5-7 years). The association of enterobiasis with other factors studied such as number of persons per house, household income per months and mother's employment status were not significant. The sensitivity of three successive days anal swabs compared to a single swab was found to be statistically significant.\n\nCanadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years (aged 0-4 years).\n\nPubMed\n\nTremblay, Mark S; Leblanc, Allana G; Carson, Valerie; Choquette, Louise; Connor Gorber, Sarah; Dillman, Carrie; Duggan, Mary; Gordon, Mary Jane; Hicks, Audrey; Janssen, Ian; Kho, Michelle E; Latimer-Cheung, Amy E; Leblanc, Claire; Murumets, Kelly; Okely, Anthony D; Reilly, John J; Stearns, Jodie A; Timmons, Brian W; Spence, John C\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP), with assistance from multiple partners, stakeholders, and researchers, developed the first Canadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years (aged 0-4 years). These national guidelines are in response to a call from health and health care professionals, child care providers, and fitness practitioners for guidance on sedentary behaviour in the early years. The guideline development process followed the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation (AGREE) II framework. The recommendations are informed by evidence from a systematic review that examined the relationships between sedentary behaviour (predominantly screen time) and health indicators (healthy body weight, bone and skeletal health, motor skill development, psychosocial health, cognitive development, and cardio-metabolic disease risk factors) for three age groups (infants aged <1 year; toddlers aged 1-2 years; preschoolers aged 3-4 years). Evidence from the review was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The new guidelines include a preamble to provide context, followed by the specific recommendations. The final guidelines benefitted from extensive on-line consultations with input from >900 domestic and international stakeholders, end-users, and key informants. The final guidelines state: for healthy growth and development, caregivers should minimize the time infants (aged <1 year), toddlers (aged 1-2 years), and preschoolers (aged 3-4 years) spend being sedentary during waking hours. This includes prolonged sitting or being restrained (e.g., stroller, high chair) for more than 1 h at a time. For those under 2 years, screen time (e.g., TV, computer, electronic games) is not recommended. For children 2-4 years, screen time should be limited to under 1 h per day; less is better.\n\n[Weight and height local growth charts of Algerian children and adolescents (6-18 years of age)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBahchachi, N; Dahel-Mekhancha, C C; Rolland-Cachera, M F; Badis, N; Roelants, M; Hauspie, R; Nezzal, L\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMeasurements of height and weight provide important information on growth and development, puberty, and nutritional status in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to develop contemporary reference growth centiles for Algerian children and adolescents (6-18 years of age). A cross-sectional growth survey was conducted in government schools on 7772 healthy schoolchildren (45.1% boys and 54.9% girls) aged 6-18 years in Constantine (eastern Algeria) in 2008. Height and weight were measured with portable stadiometers and calibrated scales, respectively. Smooth reference curves of height and weight were estimated with the LMS method. These height and weight curves are presented together with local data from Arab countries and with the growth references of France, Belgium (Flanders), and the World Health Organization (WHO) 2007. In girls, median height and weight increased until 16 and 17 years of age, respectively, whereas in boys, they increased through age 18 years. Between ages 11 and 13 years (puberty), girls were taller and heavier than boys. After puberty, boys became taller than girls, by up to 13 cm by the age of 18 years. Median height and weight of Algerian boys and girls were generally intermediate between those observed in other Arab countries. They were higher than the French reference values up to the age of 13 years and lower than Belgian and WHO reference values at all ages. The present study provides Algerian height- and weight-for-age growth charts, which should be recommended as a national reference for monitoring growth and development in children and adolescents.

We report the cases of 15 patients treated under the age of 4 years and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this treatment for patients in this age group. We report the use of BH4 in 15 PKU patients treated before the age of 4 years. Fifteen patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Mean phenylalaninemia at diagnosis was 542 Â± 164 Î¼M and all patients had mild PKU (maximal phenylalaninemia: 600-1200 Î¼M). BH4 responsiveness was assessed using a 24-hour BH4 loading test (20 mg/kg), performed during the neonatal period (n = 11) or before 18 months of age (n = 4). During the test, these patients exhibited an 80 Â± 12% decrease in phenylalaninemia. Long-term BH4 therapy was initiated during the neonatal period (n = 7) or at the age of 13 Â± 12 months (n = 8). The median duration of treatment was 23 months [min 7; max 80]. BH4 therapy drastically improved dietary phenylalanine tolerance (456 Â± 181 vs 1683 Â± 627 mg/day, p < 0.0001) and allowed a phenylalanine-free amino acid mixture to be discontinued or not introduced in 14 patients. Additionally, in the eight patients treated after a few months of diet therapy, BH4 treatment significantly decreased mean phenylalaninemia (352 Â± 85 vs 254 Â± 64 Î¼M, p < 0.05), raised the percentage of phenylalaninemia tests within therapeutic targets [120-300 Î¼M] (35 Â± 25 vs 64 Â± 16%, p < 0.05), and reduced phenylalaninemia variance (130 Â± 21 vs 93 Â± 27 Î¼M, p < 0.05). No side effects were reported. BH4-therapy is efficient and safe before the age of 4 years in mild PKU, BH4-responsive patients.\n\nFracture Incidence and Characteristics in Young Adults Aged 18 to 49 Years: A Population-Based Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarr, Joshua N; Melton, L Joseph; Achenbach, Sara J; Atkinson, Elizabeth J; Khosla, Sundeep; Amin, Shreyasee\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAlthough fractures in both the pediatric and, especially, the elderly populations have been extensively investigated, comparatively little attention has been given to the age group in between. Thus, we used the comprehensive (inpatient and outpatient) data resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to determine incidence rates for all fractures among young adult (age range, 18 to 49 years) residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, in 2009 to 2011, and compared the distribution of fracture sites and causes in this young adult cohort with those for older residents aged 50 years or older. During the 3-year study period, 2482 Olmsted County residents aged 18 to 49 years experienced 1 or more fractures. There were 1730 fractures among 1447 men compared with 1164 among 1035 women, and the age-adjusted incidence of all fractures was 66% greater among the men (1882 [95% confidence interval 1793-1971] versus 1135 [95% CI 1069-1201] per 100,000 person-years; pâ<â0.001). Of all fractures, 80% resulted from severe trauma (eg, motor vehicle accidents) compared with 33% in Olmsted County residents age â¥50 years who sustained a fracture in 2009 to 2011. Younger residents (aged 18 to 49 years), when compared with older residents (aged â¥50 years), had a greater proportion of fractures of the hands and feet (40% versus 18%) with relatively few fractures observed at traditional osteoporotic fracture sites (14% versus 43%). Vertebral fractures were still more likely to be the result of moderate trauma than at other sites, especially in younger women. In conclusion, whereas pediatric and elderly populations often fracture from no more than moderate trauma, young adults, and more commonly men, suffer fractures primarily at non-osteoporotic sites due to more significant trauma.

This study was to determine whether and how 12-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were associated with specific occupations among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S. Data were from 184,300 currently employed adults who participated in the 2008-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). NSDUH provides nationally representative data on suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted. Among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., 3.5% had suicidal ideation in the past 12months (3.1% had suicidal ideation only, and 0.4% had suicidal ideation and attempted suicide). Compared with adults in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations (model adjusted prevalence (MAP)=1.6%), adults in the following occupations were 3.0-3.6 times more likely to have suicidal ideation in the past year (model adjusted relative risks (MARRs)=3.0-3.6): lawyers, judges, and legal support workers (MAP=4.8%), social scientists and related workers (MAP=5.4%), and media and communication workers (MAP=5.8%). Among employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., the 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation varies by occupations. Adults in occupations that are at elevated risk for suicidal ideation may warrant focused suicide prevention.

Data were collected through databases including China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), CBM disc, Wanfang Data, Pubmed and Medline. The inclusion criteria were: 1. Epidemiological study in healthy population not included studies limited to specific patient; 2. Study subject was not the specific lead exposure population; 3. Sample size should be no less than 100 (for neonatal, no less than 50); 4. BLL detection was under strict quality control; and 5. Results should be presented as BLL (arithmetic mean level or geometric mean level). 62 articles were included in this study. All the surveys in these articles contained 189,352 subjects in 19 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Linear regression analysis showed a significant decrease between 1990 and 2012 with an estimated regression coefficient of 3.05/year (SE=0.01, p<0.001). BLL gradually declined since early 21st century. Median levels of BLL among the three economic zones were 51.4 Î¼g/L in the eastern zone, 52.72 Î¼g/L in the central zone and 46.2 Î¼g/L in the western zone respectively. Median BLLs in male and female population aged 0-18 years old of China were 48.8 Î¼g/L and 46.1Î¼g/L. Median levels of BLL among the different age ranges were 74.9 Î¼g/L in newborn, 46.4 Î¼g/L in 0 to 3 years old, 57.6 Î¼g/L in 3 to 7 years old and 55.6 Î¼g/L in above 7 years old respectively. In conclusion, the BLL in the Chinese population of 0-18 years old has gradually dropped in the past 10 years. The decline in temporal trend still remains under potential impacts of several factors such as economical level, gender and age difference. Although, China has made significant achievements in the control prevention of lead\n\n9 CFR 71.18 - Individual identification of certain cattle 2 years of age or over for movement in interstate...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n... cattle 2 years of age or over for movement in interstate commerce. 71.18 Section 71.18 Animals and Animal... certain cattle 2 years of age or over for movement in interstate commerce.

Application of the chILD Classification Scheme.\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Leland L; Dishop, Megan K; Galambos, Csaba; Askin, Frederic B; White, Frances V; Langston, Claire; Liptzin, Deborah R; Kroehl, Miranda E; Deutsch, Gail H; Young, Lisa R; Kurland, Geoffrey; Hagood, James; Dell, Sharon; Trapnell, Bruce C; Deterding, Robin R\n\n2015-10-01\n\nChildren's Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Disease (chILD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders that is challenging to categorize. In previous study, a classification scheme was successfully applied to children 0 to 2 years of age who underwent lung biopsies for chILD. This classification scheme has not been evaluated in children 2 to 18 years of age. This multicenter interdisciplinary study sought to describe the spectrum of biopsy-proven chILD in North America and to apply a previously reported classification scheme in children 2 to 18 years of age. Mortality and risk factors for mortality were also assessed. Patients 2 to 18 years of age who underwent lung biopsies for diffuse lung disease from 12 North American institutions were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected and described. The lung biopsies were reviewed by pediatric lung pathologists with expertise in diffuse lung disease and were classified by the chILD classification scheme. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for mortality. A total of 191 cases were included in the final analysis. Number of biopsies varied by center (5-49 biopsies; mean, 15.8) and by age (2-18 yr; mean, 10.6 yr). The most common classification category in this cohort was Disorders of the Immunocompromised Host (40.8%), and the least common was Disorders of Infancy (4.7%). Immunocompromised patients suffered the highest mortality (52.8%). Additional associations with mortality included mechanical ventilation, worse clinical status at time of biopsy, tachypnea, hemoptysis, and crackles. Pulmonary hypertension was found to be a risk factor for mortality but only in the immunocompetent patients. In patients 2 to 18 years of age who underwent lung biopsies for diffuse lung disease, there were far fewer diagnoses prevalent in infancy and more overlap with adult diagnoses. Immunocompromised patients with diffuse lung disease who underwent lung biopsies had less than 50% survival at time of last follow-up.\n\nAge at onset and persistence of eczema are related to subsequent risk of asthma and hay fever from birth to 18Â years of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nLowe, Adrian J; Angelica, Bianca; Su, John; Lodge, Caroline J; Hill, David J; Erbas, Bircan; Bennett, Catherine M; Gurrin, Lyle C; Axelrad, Christine; Abramson, Michael J; Allen, Katrina J; Dharmage, Shyamali C\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFew studies have simultaneously addressed the importance of age of onset and persistence of eczema for the subsequent development of asthma and hay fever, particularly into early adulthood. A high-risk birth cohort was recruited comprising 620 infants, who were then followed up frequently until 2Â years of age, annually from age 3 to 7, then at 12 and 18Â years, to document any episodes of eczema, current asthma, and hay fever. The generalized estimation equationÂ technique was used to examine asthma and hay fever outcomes at 6 (nÂ =Â 325), 12 (nÂ =Â 248) and 18 (nÂ =Â 240) years, when there was consistency of associations across the follow-ups. Very early-onset persistent (onset <6Â months, still present from 2 to 5Â years) eczema was related to current asthma (adjusted ORÂ =Â 3.2 [95% CIÂ =Â 1.7-6.1]), as was very early-onset remitting eczema (onset <6Â months but not present from 2-5Â years, ORÂ =Â 2.7, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.0-7.2) and early-onset persistent eczema (onset from 6-24Â months, ORÂ =Â 2.3, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.2-4.7). Late-onset eczema (commenced from 2-5Â years) was associated with increased risk of asthma at 12Â years (ORÂ =Â 3.0, 95% CI=1.1-8.2) but not at age 6Â years. Only very early-onset persistent eczema was associated with increased risk of hay fever (aORÂ =Â 2.4, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.4-4.1). Eczema which commences in early infancy and persists into toddler years is strongly associated with asthma, and to a lesser extent hay fever, in high-risk children. If these associations are causal, prevention of early-life eczema might reduce the risk of respiratory allergy. Â© 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

However, no information exists on AVA use in children and ethical barriers exist to performing pre-event pediatric AVA studies. A Presidential Ethics Commission proposed a potential pathway for such studies utilizing an age de-escalation process comparing safety and immunogenicity data from 18 to 20 year-olds to older adults and if acceptable proceeding to evaluations in younger adolescents. We conducted exploratory summary re-analyses of existing databases from 18 to 20 year-olds (n=74) compared to adults aged 21 to 29 years (n=243) who participated in four previous US government funded AVA studies. Data extracted from studies included elicited local injection-site and systemic adverse events (AEs) following AVA doses given subcutaneously at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Additionally, proportions of subjects with â¥4-fold antibody rises from baseline to post-second and post-third AVA doses (seroresponse) were obtained. Rates of any elicited local AEs were not significantly different between younger and older age groups for local events (79.2% vs. 83.8%, P=0.120) or systemic events (45.4% vs. 50.5%, P=0.188). Robust and similar proportions of seroresponses to vaccination were observed in both age groups. AVA was safe and immunogenic in 18 to 20 year-olds compared to 21 to 29 year-olds. These results provide initial information to anthrax and pediatric specialists if AVA studies in adolescents are required. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated short-term changes in ambient air pollutant concentrations, including speciated particulate matter less than 2.5 Î¼m in diameter (PM2.5), in relation to emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory infections in young children. Daily counts of ED visits for bronchitis and bronchiolitis (n = 80,399), pneumonia (n = 63,359), and upper respiratory infection (URI) (n = 359,246) among children 0-4 years of age were collected from hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia, area for the period 1993-2010. Daily pollutant measurements were combined across monitoring stations using population weighting. In Poisson generalized linear models, 3-day moving average concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and the organic carbon fraction of particulate matter less than 2.5 Î¼m in diameter (PM2.5) were associated with ED visits for pneumonia and URI. Ozone associations were strongest and were observed at low (cold-season) concentrations; a 1-interquartile range increase predicted a 4% increase (95% confidence interval: 2%, 6%) in visits for URI and an 8% increase (95% confidence interval: 4%, 13%) in visits for pneumonia. Rate ratios tended to be higher in the 1- to 4-year age group compared with infants. Results suggest that primary traffic pollutants, ozone, and the organic carbon fraction of PM2.5 exacerbate upper and lower respiratory infections in early life, and that the carbon fraction of PM2.5 is a particularly harmful component of the ambient particulate matter mixture.

The duration of protection against HPV-16/18 from prophylactic vaccination remains unknown. We investigated the 10-year immune response and long-term safety profile of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine) in females aged between 15 and 55Â years at first vaccination. Females who received primary vaccination with three doses of AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in the primary phase-III study (NCT00196937) were invited to attend annual evaluations for long-term immunogenicity and safety. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies in serum and cervico-vaginal secretions (CVS) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the follow-up period. Seropositivity rates for anti-HPV-16 remained high (â¥96.3%) in all age groups 10Â years after first vaccination. It was found that 99.2% of 15-25-year olds remained seropositive for anti-HPV-18 compared to 93.7% and 83.8% of 26-45-year olds and 45-55-year olds, respectively. Geometric mean titers (GMT) remained above natural infection levels in all age groups. Anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 titers were at least 5.3-fold and 3.1-fold higher than titers observed after natural infection, respectively, and were predicted to persist above natural infection levels for â¥30Â years in all age groups. At Year 10, anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers in subjects aged 15-25Â years remained above plateau levels observed in previous studies. Correlation coefficients for antibody titers in serum and CVS were 0.64 (anti-HPV-16) and 0.38 (anti-HPV-18). This study concluded that vaccinated females aged 15-55Â years elicited sustained immunogenicity with an acceptable safety profile up to 10Â years after primary vaccination, suggesting long-term protection against HPV.

We assessed the association between sports engagement and age at first myocardial infarction (MI) in a cohort of men under 55 years of age. The Bern percutaneous coronary intervention Registry (NCT 02241291) was analyzed from March 2009 until January 2012. Male patients with first MI, age 18 to 54 years and body mass index â¤25kg/m2 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their starting age with organized sports â¥1 h/week outside school (EARLY: <18, CONTROL: â¥18 years or never). We assessed age at time of first MI, CVRF, and volume of sports training. Of 4,394 consecutive patients, 123 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (EARLY n = 81, CONTROL n = 42). Age at the time of first MI was 3 years younger in the EARLY compared to the CONTROL group (46.8Â±6.0 vs. 49.8Â±4.6 years, p = 0.006). Total lifetime training hours, and average yearly training hours, both, before and after age 18, were significantly greater in the EARLY group. Years of training <18 years were weakly inversely correlated with age at first MI (r2 = 0.075, p = 0.002). The proportion of sports-related MI was not different between EARLY and CONTROL (13.6% vs. 11.9%). Patients in the EARLY group had fewer CVRF (2 vs. 3; p = 0.001). Prevalence of smoking was equally high in both groups (63.0% and 64.3%). In our patients aged 54 and younger, the first MI occurred 3 years earlier in those who started regular sports activity before age 18, despite a more active lifestyle and favorable CVRF profile.\n\nHealth screenings for men ages 18 to 39\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nHealth maintenance visit - men - ages 18 to 39; Physical exam - men - ages 18 to 39; Yearly exam - ... 39; Checkup - men - ages 18 to 39; Men's health - ages 18 to 39; Preventive care exam - men - ...\n\nAre two doses of human papillomavirus vaccine sufficient for girls aged 15-18 years?

Immunogenicity and vaccine targeted HPV infection outcomes were compared between 1795 girls aged 15-18 years receiving two (1-180 days) and 1515 girls of same age receiving three (1-60-180 days) doses. Immunogenicity outcomes in 15-18 year old two-dose recipients were also compared with the 10-14 year old three-dose (Nâ¯=â¯2833) and two-dose (Nâ¯=â¯3184) recipients. The 15-18 year old two-dose recipients had non-inferior L1-binding antibody titres at seven months against vaccine-targeted HPV types compared to three-dose recipients at 15-18 years and three-dose recipients at 10-14 years of age. Neutralizing antibody titres at 18 months in 15-18 year old two-dose recipients were non-inferior to same age three-dose recipients for all except HPV 18. The titres were inferior to those in the 10-14 year old three-dose recipients for all targeted types. Frequency of incident infections from vaccine-targeted HPV types in the 15-18 year old two-dose recipients was similar to the three dose recipients. None of the girls receiving two or three doses had persistent infection from vaccine-targeted types. These findings support that two doses of HPV vaccine can be extended to girls aged 15-18 years.

Descriptive and etiological study. The study involved 1332 persons aged below 18 years and members of 521 representative households in French Guiana. VC was estimated by the proportion of people with complete immunization for 13 vaccines (four mandatory, seven recommended, and two specific). This vaccination status was described in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. The relationship between vaccination status and predictive factors was analyzed in a hierarchical mixed, polytomic, and ordered regression model. For compulsory vaccination, VC was 81.2% for yellow fever, 63.4% for diphtheria, 61.7% for tetanus, and 61.6% for poliomyelitis. The proportion of people with complete immunization for recommended vaccines remains well below 50% (11.7% for pneumococcus and 6.2% for meningitis). Regardless of the vaccine, respondents aged 3-7 years were 2.5 times more likely to have an up-to-date vaccination compared to respondents younger than 3 years of age (PÂ <Â 0.001). The VC observed in this study is still below the departmental objectives. The link between age and vaccination status could be explained by the efforts of the national education authorities to systematically check health cards for preschool and school enrollment.

Childhood cat ownership has been hypothesized as an intermediary marker of T. gondii infection and, by proxy, as a risk factor for later psychosis. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is, however, limited. We used birth cohort data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to investigate whether cat ownership in pregnancy and childhood (ages 4 and 10 years) was associated with psychotic experiences (PEs) in early (age 13, N = 6705) and late (age 18, N = 4676) adolescence, rated from semi-structured interviews. We used logistic regression to examine associations between cat ownership and PEs, adjusting for several sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, household characteristics and dog ownership. Missing data were handled via multiple imputation. Cat ownership during pregnancy was not associated with PEs at age 13 years [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.35] or 18 years (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86-1.35). Initial univariable evidence that cat ownership at ages 4 and 10 years was associated with PEs at age 13 years did not persist after multivariable adjustment (4 years: OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94-1.48; 10 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92-1.36). There was no evidence that childhood cat ownership was associated with PEs at age 18 years. While pregnant women should continue to avoid handling soiled cat litter, given possible T. gondii exposure, our study strongly indicates that cat ownership in pregnancy or early childhood does not confer an increased risk of later adolescent PEs.\n\nAn Evaluation of Functional Sit-to-Stand Power in Cohorts of Healthy Adults Aged 18-97 Years.\n\nPubMed\n\nGlenn, Jordan M; Gray, Michelle; Vincenzo, Jennifer; Paulson, Sally; Powers, Melissa\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis investigation examined differences in functional sit-to-stand power/velocity between cohorts of adults aged 18-97 years. This study included 264 healthy adults classified into four cohorts (18-40, C1; 60-69, C2; 70-79, C2; â¥ 80, C4). Participants completed the sit-to-stand task five times. Power and velocity were measured via the TENDO power analyzer. Absolute average power was maintained from C1-C3, but decreased (p < .01) in C4. Absolute peak power decreased between C1-C2 (p < .01), was similar between C2-C3, and decreased in C4 (p < .01). Relative (to body weight) average and peak power decreased between C1-C2 (p < .01), was similar between C2-C3, and decreased in C4 (p < .01). Average velocity was similar between C1 and C2, but decreased in C3 (p < .01) and C4 (p < .01), respectively. Peak velocity was significantly different between all cohorts (p < .01). Declines in functional power may plateau during the seventh and eighth decades, accelerating after 80 years.\n\nHospital costs associated with atrial fibrillation for ischemic stroke patients aged 18-64 years in the United States\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Guijing; Joo, Heesoo; Tong, Xin; George, Mary G.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose Hospital costs associated with atrial fibrillation (AFib) among stroke patients have not been well-studied, especially among people younger than 65 years. We estimated the AFib-associated hospital costs in U.S. patients aged 18-64 years. Methods We identified hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke from the 2010-2012 MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters inpatient datasets, excluding those with capitated health insurance plans, aged <18 or >64, missing geographic region, hospital costs below the 1st or above 99th percentile, and having carotid intervention (N=40,082). We searched the data for AFib and analyzed the costs for non-repeat and repeat stroke admissions separately. We estimated the AFib-associated costs using multivariate regression models controlling for age, sex, geographic region, and Charlson comorbidity index. Results Of the 33,500 non-repeat stroke admissions, 2,407 (7.2%) had AFib. Admissions with AFib cost $4,991 more than those without AFib ($23,770 vs. $18,779). For the 6,582 repeat stroke admissions, 397 (6.0%) had AFib. The costs were $3,260 more for those with AFib than those without ($24,119 vs. $20,929). After controlling for potential confounders, AFib-associated costs for non-repeat stroke admissions were $4,905, representing 20.6% of the total costs for the admissions. Both the hospital costs and the AFib-associated costs were associated with age, but not sex. AFib-associated costs for repeat stroke admissions were not significantly higher than for non-AFib patients, except for those aged 55-64 ($3,537). Conclusions AFib increased the hospital cost of ischemic stroke substantially. Further investigation on AFib-associated costs for repeat stroke admissions is needed.

Weight, length and height, and relative skeletal age (skeletal-chronological age) were assessed annually from birth to age 18 years in 521 subjects (255 women) in the Fels Longitudinal Study who were overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) >25 kgâm(-2), n=131) or normal weight (n=390) in young adulthood (18-30 years). Generalized estimating equations were used to test for skeletal maturity and stature differences by young adult BMI status. Differences in height increased during puberty, being significant for girls at ages 10 to 12 years, and for boys at ages 11 to 13 years (P-values<0.001), with overweight or obese adults being â¼3 cm taller at those ages than normal weight adults. These differences then diminished so that by age 18 years, overweight or obese adults were not significantly different in stature to their normal weight peers. Differences in skeletal maturity were similar, but more pervasive; overweight or obese adults were more skeletally advanced throughout childhood. Skeletal maturity differences peaked at chronological age 12 in boys and 14 in girls (P-values<0.001), with overweight or obese adults being â¼1 year more advanced than normal weight adults. This descriptive study is the first to track advanced skeletal maturity and linear growth acceleration throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence in individuals who become overweight, showing that differences occur primarily around the time of the pubertal growth spurt. Increased BMI in children on a path to becoming overweight adults precedes an advancement in skeletal development and subsequently tall stature during puberty. Further work is required to assess the predictive value of accelerated pubertal height growth for assessing obesity risk in a variety of populations.\n\nThe Associations of Lens Power With Age and Axial Length in Healthy Chinese Children and Adolescents Aged 6 to 18 Years.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Shuyu; Zhang, Bo; Hong, Yuan; He, Xiangui; Zhu, Jianfeng; Zou, Haidong; Xu, Xun\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship between lens power and age as well as the relationship between lens power and axial length (AL) in Chinese children and adolescents. The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination that included AL, cycloplegic refraction, and Pentacam measurements. The crystalline lens power was calculated using Bennett's formula and then compared among the children of different age groups, refractive statuses, and AL categories. The association of lens power and AL was analyzed using multiple regression. A total of 1992 children and adolescents aged 6- to 18-years old were included. The difference in lens power was greater before 10-years old, followed by a relatively smaller difference in children aged 10 to 14 years and the difference in lens power came to a near plateau in adolescents after 14-years old. The negative association between lens power and AL was found to be more evident in nonmyopes than in myopes irrespective of age (younger than 10 years: nonmyopes: Î² = -1.499, myopes: Î² = -0.872; older than 10 years: nonmyopes: Î² = -1.288, myopes: Î² = -0.390, all P < 0.001). The lens power in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years exhibited three stages. The association between lens power and AL differed between the nonmyopes and myopes. These findings suggested that less reduction in lens power might be associated with both growing age and increasing AL in myopes.\n\nFrom Childhood Conduct Problems to Poor Functioning at Age 18 Years: Examining Explanations in a Longitudinal Cohort Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWertz, Jasmin; Agnew-Blais, Jessica; Caspi, Avshalom; Danese, Andrea; Fisher, Helen L; Goldman-Mellor, Sidra; Moffitt, Terrie E; Arseneault, Louise\n\n2018-01-01\n\nChildhood conduct problems are associated with poor functioning in early adulthood. We tested a series of hypotheses to understand the mechanisms underlying this association. We used data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995, followed up to age 18 years with 93% retention. Severe conduct problems in childhood were assessed at ages 5, 7, and 10 years using parent and teacher reports. Poor functioning at age 18 years, including cautions and convictions, daily cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and psychosocial difficulties, was measured through interviews with participants and official crime record searches. Participants 18 years old with versus without a childhood history of severe conduct problems had greater rates of each poor functional outcome, and they were more likely to experience multiple poor outcomes. This association was partly accounted for by concurrent psychopathology in early adulthood, as well as by early familial risk factors, both genetic and environmental. Childhood conduct problems, however, continued to predict poor outcomes at age 18 years after accounting for these explanations. Children with severe conduct problems display poor functioning at age 18 years because of concurrent problems in early adulthood and familial risk factors originating in childhood. However, conduct problems also exert a lasting effect on young people's lives independent of these factors, pointing to early conduct problems as a target for early interventions aimed at preventing poor functional outcomes.

Some studies have followed these infants through early school age and have shown some conflicting results regarding cognitive outcome. Such studies that assess children at younger ages may not accurately predict outcomes in later childhood, as it is known that fluid and crystallized intelligence peak at age 26 years. There is paucity of data in current medical literature, which correlates low-grade IVH with outcomes in early adulthood. To determine the link between the occurrence of low-grade IVH in low birth weight (birth weight â©½2500âg) infants born prematurely (gestational age <37 weeks) and intellectual function, academic achievement, and behavioral problems to the age of 18 years. This study is an analysis of data derived from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a multisite national collaborative study and a randomized controlled trial of education intervention for low birth weight infants from birth until 3 years of age with follow-up through 18 years of age. A total of 985 infants were enrolled in the IHDP. Of the 462 infants tested for IVH, 99 demonstrated sonographic evidence of low-grade IVH, whereas 291 showed no sonographic evidence of IVH. Several outcomes were compared between these two groups. Intelligence was assessed using Stanford-Binet Intelligence scales at age 3 years, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) at age 8 years, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) at age 18 years and Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement at age 8 and 18 years. Behavior was measured using the Achenbach Behavior Checklist at age 3 years and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at age 8 and 18 years. Outcomes were compared between the IVH-positive and IVH-negative groups\n\nBirth order modifies the effect of IL13 gene polymorphisms on serum IgE at age 10 and skin prick test at ages 4, 10 and 18: a prospective birth cohort study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Susceptibility to atopy originates from effects of the environment on genes. Birth order has been identified as a risk factor for atopy and evidence for some candidate genes has been accumulated; however no study has yet assessed a birth order-gene interaction. Objective To investigate the interaction of IL13 polymorphisms with birth order on allergic sensitization at ages 4, 10 and 18 years. Methods Mother-infant dyads were recruited antenatally and followed prospectively to age 18 years. Questionnaire data (at birth, age 4, 10, 18); skin prick test (SPT) at ages 4, 10, 18; total serum IgE and specific inhalant screen at age 10; and genotyping for IL13 were collected. Three SNPs were selected from IL13: rs20541 (exon 4, nonsynonymous SNP), rs1800925 (promoter region) and rs2066960 (intron 1). Analysis included multivariable log-linear regression analyses using repeated measurements to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs). Results Of the 1456 participants, birth order information was available for 83.2% (1212/1456); SPT was performed on 67.4% at age 4, 71.2% at age 10 and 58.0% at age 18. The prevalence of atopy (sensitization to one or more food or aeroallergens) increased from 19.7% at age 4, to 26.7% at 10 and 41.1% at age 18. Repeated measurement analysis indicated interaction between rs20541 and birth order on SPT. The stratified analyses demonstrated that the effect of IL13 on SPT was restricted only to first-born children (p = 0.007; adjusted PR = 1.35; 95%CI = 1.09, 1.69). Similar findings were noted for firstborns regarding elevated total serum IgE at age 10 (p = 0.007; PR = 1.73; 1.16, 2.57) and specific inhalant screen (p = 0.034; PR = 1.48; 1.03, 2.13). Conclusions This is the first study to show an interaction between birth order and IL13 polymorphisms on allergic sensitization. Future functional genetic research need to determine whether or not birth order is related to altered expression and methylation of the IL13 gene.

This study measures preference-based health state utility (HSU) values, a scaled index of health-related quality of life for economic evaluation, for younger women with breast cancer and compares these values with same-age women with other cancers and older women (aged â¥45 years) with breast cancer. Data from the 2009 and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed in 2014. The sample included 218,852 women; 7,433 and 18,577 had histories of breast and other cancers. HSU values were estimated using Healthy Days survey questions and a published mapping algorithm. Linear regression models for HSU were estimated by age group (18-44 and â¥45 years). The adjusted breast cancer HSU impact was four times larger for younger women than for older women (-0.097 vs -0.024, p<0.001). For younger women, the effect of breast cancer on HSU was 70% larger than that of other cancers (-0.097 vs -0.057, p=0.024). Younger breast cancer survivors reported lower HSU values than older survivors, highlighting the impact of breast cancer on the physical and mental health of younger women. The estimates may be used to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years or expectancy for prevention or treatment of breast cancer. This study also indicates that separate quality of life adjustments for women by age group are important for economic analysis of public health breast cancer interventions.

Nonmelanoma skin cancers, comprised mainly of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are the most common malignancies in the United States. Melanoma, although less common, is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers can be disfiguring, negatively affect quality of life, and create economic burden. Furthermore, age-adjusted incidence rates of both have increased in recent years. Different patterns of sun exposure are associated with different types of skin cancer. Continuous, chronic sun exposure, such as that observed among outdoor workers is associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Intermittent exposure, such as recreational exposure, is associated with melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Sunburn typically occurs after intermittent exposure, and the risk for melanoma increases with an increasing number of sunburns during all periods of life. Sunburn is more common among persons aged 18-29 years compared with older adults. To evaluate trends in sunburn and sun protective behaviors among persons aged 18-29 years, CDC and the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The results indicated that although protective behaviors such as sunscreen use, shade use, and wearing long clothing to the ankles have increased in recent years, sunburn prevalence remains high, with 50.1% of all adults and 65.6% of whites aged 18-29 years reporting at least one sunburn in the past 12 months. These results suggest that additional efforts are needed to identify and implement effective strategies targeting younger adults to improve their sun protective behaviors and prevent sunburn and ultimately skin cancer.\n\nReference charts of sitting height, leg length and body proportions for Chinese children aged 0-18 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Ya-qin; Li, Hui\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe reference charts of sitting height (SH), subischial leg length (LL) and the sitting height/leg length ratio (SH/LL) are useful tools in assessing body proportion for clinicians and researchers in related areas. However, reference charts of body proportions for Chinese children and adolescents are limited. To construct reference charts of SH, LL and SH/LL for Chinese children and adolescents. Stature and sitting height of 92 494 (46 240 boys and 46 254 girls) healthy Han nationality children, aged 0-18 years, were measured in two national large-scale cross-sectional surveys in 2005 in China. SH/LL was selected as the indicator of body proportion. References of SH, LL and SH/LL were constructed using the LMS method. The reference charts demonstrated that SH and LL increased with age. Growth in SH slowed by the age of 17 years in boys and 15 years in girls. Similarly, growth in LL slowed at 16 years in boys and 14 years in girls. The SH/LL ratio declined from birth (2.00 in boys and 2.03 in girls) to 13 years in boys (1.11) and to 11 years in girls (1.13), then increased slightly to the age of 18 (1.16 in boys and 1.18 in girls). The gender difference of SH/LL was not significantly different before the age of 11 years. After the age of 11, SH/LL appeared elevated in girls compared to boys. The reference charts of SH, LL and SH/LL are useful tools for assessing body proportions for Chinese children and adolescent individuals.\n\nCuriosity killed the cat: No evidence of an association between cat ownership and psychotic symptoms at age 13 and 18 years in a UK general population cohort\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSolmi, F.; Hayes, J.F; Lewis, G.; Kirkbride, J.B\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Congenital or early life infection with Toxoplasma Gondii has been implicated in schizophrenia aetiology. Childhood cat ownership has been hypothesised as an intermediary marker of T. Gondii infection and, by proxy, as a risk factor for later psychosis. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is, however, limited. Method We used birth cohort data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to investigate whether cat ownership in pregnancy and childhood (4, 10 years old) was associated with psychotic experiences (PEs) in early (age 13; N=6,705) and late (age 18; N=4,676) adolescence, rated from semi-structured interviews. We used logistic regression to examine associations between cat ownership and PEs, adjusting for several sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, household characteristics and dog ownership. Missing data were handled via multiple imputation. Results Cat ownership during pregnancy was not associated with PEs at age 13 (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.35) or 18 years (OR: 1.08, 95%CI: 0.86-1.35). Initial univariable evidence that cat ownership at 4 and 10 years was associated with PEs at age 13 years did not persist after multivariable adjustment (4 years OR: 1.18, 95%CI: 0.94-1.48; 10 years OR 1.12, 95%CI: 0.92; 1.36). There was no evidence that childhood cat ownership was associated with PEs at 18 years old. Conclusions While pregnant women should continue to avoid handling soiled cat litter, given possible T Gondii exposure, our study strongly indicates that cat ownership in pregnancy or early childhood does not confer an increased risk of later adolescent PEs.

Specifically, we examined variation in conservative versus liberal ideologies at age 18 years as a function of parenting attitudes and child temperament during the first 5 years of life. Consistent with long-standing theories on the development of political attitudes, our results showed that parents' authoritarian attitudes assessed when children were 1 month old predicted conservative attitudes in those children more than 17 years later. Consistent with the findings of Block and Block (2006), our results also showed that early childhood temperament predicted variation in conservative versus liberal ideologies.\n\nFingolimod Prescribed for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Patients Younger Than Age 18Â Years.\n\nPubMed\n\nFragoso, Yara Dadalti; Alves-Leon, Soniza Vieira; Barreira, Amilton Antunes; Callegaro, Dagoberto; Brito Ferreira, Maria Lucia; Finkelsztejn, Alessandro; Gomes, Sidney; Magno Goncalves, Marcus Vinicius; Moraes Machado, Maria Iris; Marques, Vanessa Daccach; Cunha Matta, Andre Palma; Papais-Alvarenga, Regina Maria; Apostolos Pereira, Samira Luisa; Tauil, Carlos Bernardo\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThere have been no clinical trials for approval of medications for treating multiple sclerosis in patients younger than age 18Â years. All treatments are based on personal experience and data from open observational studies. Fingolimod is an oral drug for multiple sclerosis that has been shown to be efficient and safe in adults. The aim of our study is to describe patients with multiple sclerosis who started treatment with fingolimod before the age of 18Â years. Seventeen patients treated with fingolimod were identified in the Brazilian database of children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis. The average time of use of the drug was 8.6Â months. Fingolimod showed a good safety and efficacy profile in these patients, all of whom had very active multiple sclerosis. After starting treatment with fingolimod, only one patient had a relapse and a new lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. The patients' degree of disability did not progress. No major adverse events were reported in relation to the first dose of the drug, nor in the short- and medium-term treatment. No patient has been followed for longer than 18Â months, thus limiting long-term conclusions. Off-label use of fingolimod in patients younger than age 18Â years may be a good therapeutic option for multiple sclerosis control. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the longitudinal association between complementary foods introduction age and risk of anemia in 18,446 children from the Jiaxing Birth Cohort, who had detailed complementary feeding records at 3 and 6 months of age and had hemoglobin concentrations measured at 4-6 years. Early introduction of complementary foods at 3-6 months of age was significantly associated with a higher risk of anemia (odds ratioâ=â1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.28) and a lower hemoglobin concentration of -0.84âg/L (95% confidence interval: -1.33 to -0.35) in children aged 4-6 years, compared with those fed complementary foods starting at 6 months of age. When it comes to the specific type of complementary foods, early introduction of all plant-based foods was associated with increased anemia risks and lower hemoglobin concentrations, while early introduction of most animal-based foods was not. These findings may be informative regarding the appropriate time to introduce complementary foods in infants.\n\nA comparison of folic acid awareness and intake among young women aged 18-24 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nHilton, Judith Johnson\n\n2007-10-01\n\nTo investigate public understanding of the importance of folic acid intake in young women aged 18-24 years. A written questionnaire designed by the researcher was administered to 138 young women aged 18-24 years attending college or those seeking care in the county health facility. A total of 88 complete questionnaires were used for the data analysis. Young women were not aware of the importance of folic acid, were not taking multivitamins containing folic acid, and were not consuming enough folic acid in their diets. No relationship existed between pregnancy intention and folic acid intake, suggesting that those who were planning a pregnancy in the near future were not consuming adequate amounts of folic acid. A lack of knowledge regarding the importance of folic acid may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. Many educational opportunities exist and should be developed in clinics, physician's offices, and classes which involve young women in this age group.\n\nStages in third molar development and eruption to estimate the 18-year threshold Malay juvenile.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohd Yusof, Mohd Yusmiaidil Putera; Cauwels, Rita; Martens, Luc\n\n2015-10-01\n\nAge 18 years is considered as the age of majority by most countries. To ascertain the age of interest, both third molar development (TMD) and eruption (TME) staging scores are beneficial without needing multiple imaging modalities. This study aimed to assess the chronological course of TMD and TME in a Malay sub-adult population and evaluate predictions when specific stage(s) of TMD and TME have been attained that are pertinent to the age group of interest (<18 years or â¥18 years). A sample of 714 digital panoramic images for subjects stratified by age between 14.1 and 23.9 years was retrospectively collected. The techniques described by Gleiser and Hunt (modified by Kohler) and Olze were employed to stage TMD and TME, respectively. A binary logistic regression was performed to predict the 18-year threshold with staging score as predictors. Stages 4-6 (TMD) and A-B (TME) for males and stages 4 (TMD) and A (TME) for females were found to discriminate the <18-year group. For both genders, stages 9-10 (TMD) and D (TME) can be used as reference stages to estimate whether a subject is likely to be â¥18 years, with 94.74-100% and 85.88-96.38% correct predictions, respectively. Stages 4 (TMD) and A (TME) can also be used to identify juveniles (<18 years) with a high degree of correct predictions, 100%. The juvenility of an individual is easily anticipated by using the specific staging scores of both third molar variables (TMD and TME) without complex calculations. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As reported by papers on intergenerational changes in chest size, this part of the human body is also influenced by environmental factors. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the dimensions and proportions of the chest of children and adolescents over a span of 70 years. In 2010 an anthropological study was conducted on 3878 children and adolescents aged 3-18 years living in KrakÃ³w (Poland). Data on chest dimensions (breadth, depth, circumference, chest index) were compared to data from 1938 (3719 children) and 1983 (6464 children). In boys, chests became increasingly deep; in boys 18 years of age, the chest index increased by 4.8 units, unlike girls, whose chests markedly flattened. The chest index in girls 18 years of age decreased by 4.2 units. In almost all age categories these differences were statistically significant. Also, in all age categories, children studied in 2010 had a significantly bigger chest circumference than boys and girls surveyed in 1983, respectively, by averages of 3.6 cm and 3 cm. The main reason for these changes may be the socio-economic transformation, which has been especially strong in recent decades. These results may have practical importance in many areas of knowledge, including medicine, nutritional science, and sports. They can also be important for informing preventive measures that should be taken in order to increase the physical activity of children and youth, especially boys.

Girls aged 9-14 years were randomized to receive 2D at months 0 and 6 (M0,6; (n = 550) or months 0 and 12 (M0,12; n = 415), and women aged 15-25 years received 3D at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 482). End points included noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D (primary), 2D (M0,12) versus 3D, and 2D (M0,6) versus 2D (M0,12); neutralizing antibodies; cell-mediated immunity; reactogenicity; and safety. Limits of noninferiority were predefined as <5% difference in seroconversion rate and <2-fold difference in geometric mean antibody titer ratio. One month after the last dose, both 2D regimens in girls aged 9-14 years were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years and 2D (M0,12) was noninferior to 2D (M0,6). Geometric mean antibody titer ratios (3D/2D) for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, .97-1.22) and 0.85 (.76-.95) for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D and 0.89 (.79-1.01) and 0.75 (.67-.85) for 2D (M0,12) versus 3D. The safety profile was clinically acceptable in all groups. The 2D regimens for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9-14 years (M0,6 or M0,12) elicited HPV-16/18 immune responses that were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15-25 years.

Girls aged 9-17 years (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00996125) received vaccine (n = 374) or control (n = 376) and women aged 26-45 years (NCT01277042) received vaccine (n = 606) or control (n = 606) at months 0, 1, and 6. The primary objective was to show non-inferiority of anti-HPV-16 and -18 immune responses in initially seronegative subjects at month 7, compared with Chinese women aged 18-25 years enrolled in a separate phase II/III trial (NCT00779766). Secondary objectives were to describe the anti-HPV-16 and -18 immune response, reactogenicity and safety. At month 7, immune responses were non-inferior for girls (9-17 years) vs. young women (18-25 years): the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (women/girls) was below the limit of 2 for both anti-HPV-16 (0.37 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.43]) and anti-HPV-18 (0.42 [0.36, 0.49]). Immune responses at month 7 were also non-inferior for 26-45 year-old women vs. 18-25 year-old women: the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion (18-25 minus 26-45) was below the limit of 5% for both anti-HPV-16 (0.00% [-1.53, 1.10]) and anti-HPV-18 (0.21% [-1.36, 1.68]). GMTs were 2- to 3-fold higher in girls (9-17 years) as compared with young women (18-25 years). The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine had an acceptable safety profile when administered to healthy Chinese females aged 9-45 years.\n\nOut-of-home placement to age 18 years in children exposed to a postpartum mental disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nVigod, Simone N; Laursen, Thomas Munk; Ranning, Anne; Nordentoft, Merete; Munk-Olsen, Trine\n\n2018-04-17\n\nLittle is known about risk of custody loss or out-of-home placement among children whose mothers experience postpartum mental disorders, and whether this risk differs from that of children whose mothers had earlier onset of their mental disorder. National Danish registers comprising 1 868 467 births (1982-2012) were used to determine how the timing of maternal illness onset influences out-of-home placement risk up to age 18 years among children exposed to a maternal mental disorder. Compared to children unexposed to maternal mental illness, risk was higher for children exposed to a maternal mental disorder whose mothers had a first contact for a mental disorder in the 0-12 months of predelivery (8.17/1000 person-years; aIRR 4.56, 95% CI 4.08-5.09), the first 3 months postpartum (4.60/1000 person-years; 3.55, 2.95-4.26) and 4-12 months postpartum (6.49/1000 person-years; 3.93, 3.50-4.41). Risk was even higher for children exposed to a maternal mental disorder when illness onset was more than 1-year predelivery (9.11/1000 person-years; 5.48, 5.32-5.66). Risk of out-home placement in children exposed to mothers with a new-onset postpartum mental disorder is almost as high as in children whose mothers have long-standing illness. A better understanding of the trajectories of these mothers and children is warranted. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

All the subjects aged 7-18 years in both sexes were sampled from 2005, 2010 and 2014 Chinese National Surveys on Students Constitution and Health. According to the new students' health standard of \"Screening Standard for Malnutrition of school-age children and adolescents\"(WS/T456-2014) in 2014 of China, the nutritional status of children in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities, excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan province) were analyzed and compared in different ages, genders, regions and provinces from 2005 to 2014. The Tibetan students was used with the data of Tibetan minority and all the other students from 30 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) were Han minority. The prevalence of malnutrition of children and adolescents of Han minority aged 7-18 years in 2014 was 10.0%. The prevalence of malnutrition components, including stunting, mild wasting and moderate severe wasting, were 0.8%, 3.7%, and 5.5%. Compared with 2005 and 2010, the prevalence of malnutrition of Han children and adolescents in 2014 had declined with 5.0 and 2.6 percentage points, respectively, and its components had declined with 1.0, 1.8, 2.2 and 0.4, 1.1, 1.2 percentage points, respectively. The prevalence of malnutrition of 2014 in boys was higher than in girls (11.1% vs.8.9%), the rural was higher than the urban (11.0% vs.9.1%) and the west (11.7%) was higher than the east (9.0%) and the middle (9.2%). Mild wasting of Chinese children and adolescents aged 7-18 years was the main component in malnutrition and the stunting in the Han and Tibetan children and adolescents only accounted for 8.0% and 7.5%, respectively.
