        "text": "For a long time the interest of ethnomusicologists in multipart singing has been focused mainly upon aspects of musical structure. But a performance of multipart vocal music, as any other performance where more than one individual is involved, is a special case of interpersonal relationships. The study of a female processional repertoire for the Holy Week in a Calabrian village, based on field research, music analysis and video documentation, shows the complex interaction between social roles, group dynamics and sound structure.\n\nIn the following an attempt is made to describe some alterations in singing traditions from the aspect of sociocultural context and viewed from the Estonian perspective. As particular occasions, where singing traditions in relation to cultural identity are studied, two types of festivals have been chosen: a large national festival and a small community festival. Festival is observed here as cultural performance, charac terized by periodicity and recurrence, by impersonal and predictable movement of time (Stoeltje 1983:240). A festival provides an opportunity to study the external ori entation of customs, folkloristic phenomena, transformations in the sociocultural con text, organized performance and the functional context of singing.\n\nAttitudes of Eastern European ethnomusicologists-instructors of singing are discussed. The overview is a compilation of the data gathered at formal and informal interviews with Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serb respondents. The study reveals that success of the adequate vocal training depends on three succeeding stages of the process: field work, desk work, and practical training itself. Importance of several elements of the vocal performance, such as vocal technique (resulting in timbral qualities) and articulation, was noted by the interviewees as the idiosyncratic markers of the vocal tradition to be mastered, transmitted, and represented.\n\nSinging is, as a European art, usually considered a performing art developed by methods aiming to promote technical and performing skills. When it comes to traditional music, singing as art stems from personal experience, the embodiment of traditional forms, and the simultaneous promotion of singing skills required by the music itself. Since historical and oral traditions have already been incorporated in well-known historical musical forms of Western music, contemporary ethnomusicology research is not generally considered part of a methodology aiming to form and promote a singing style or a special skill. On the contrary, such research combined with the study of historical sources (in order to define the characteristics and aesthetics of an oral tradition) promotes orality as an educational tool."
