It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36 printed in part B of House Report number 106-235. Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Doggett Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment made in order under the rule. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Part B amendment No. 36 offered by Mr. Doggett: Page 84, after line 16, insert the following new title: TITLE VIII--GULF WAR VETERANS' IRAQI CLAIMS PROTECTION SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1999''. SEC. 802. ADJUDICATION OF CLAIMS. (a) Claims Against Iraq.--The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine the validity and amounts of any claims by nationals of the United States against the Government of Iraq. Such claims must be submitted to the United States Commission within the period specified by such Commission by notice published in the Federal Register. The United States Commission shall certify to each claimant the amount determined by the Commission to be payable on the claim under this title. (b) Decision Rules.--In deciding claims under subsection (a), the United States Commission shall apply, in the following order-- (1) applicable substantive law, including international law; and (2) applicable principles of justice and equity. (c) Priority Claims.--Before deciding any other claim against the Government of Iraq, the United States Commission shall, to the extent practical, decide all pending non- commercial claims of active, retired, or reserve members of the United States Armed Forces, retired former members of the United States Armed Forces, and other individuals arising out of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait or out of the 1987 attack on the USS Stark. (d) Applicability of International Claims Settlement Act.-- To the extent they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the provisions of title I (other than section 802(c)) and title VII of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 (22 U.S.C. 1621-1627 and 1645-1645o) shall apply with respect to claims under this title. SEC. 803. CLAIMS FUNDS. (a) Iraq Claims Fund.--The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish in the Treasury of the United States a fund (hereafter in this title referred to as the ``Iraq Claims Fund'') for payment of claims certified under section 802(a). The Secretary of the Treasury shall cover into the Iraq Claims Fund such amounts as are allocated to such fund pursuant to subsection (b). (b) Allocation of Proceeds From Iraqi Asset Liquidation.-- (1) In general.--The President shall allocate funds resulting from the liquidation of assets pursuant to section 804 in the manner the President determines appropriate between the Iraq Claims Fund and such other accounts as are appropriate for the payment of claims of the United States Government against Iraq, subject to the limitation in paragraph (2). (2) Limitation.--The amount allocated pursuant to this subsection for payment of claims of the United States Government against Iraq may not exceed the amount which bears the same relation to the amount allocated to the Iraq Claims Fund pursuant to this subsection as the sum of all certified claims of the United States Government against Iraq bears to the sum of all claims certified under section 802(a). As used in this paragraph, the term ``certified claims of the United States Government against Iraq'' means those claims of the United States Government against Iraq which are determined by the Secretary of State to be outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission and which are determined to be valid, and whose amount has been certified, [[Page 17061]] under such procedures as the President may establish. SEC. 804. AUTHORITY TO VEST IRAQI ASSETS. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate as much of the assets of the Government of Iraq in the United States that have been blocked pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) as may be necessary to satisfy claims under section 802(a), claims of the United States Government against Iraq which are determined by the Secretary of State to be outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission, and administrative expenses under section 805. SEC. 805. REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. (a) Deduction.--In order to reimburse the United States Government for its expenses in administering this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deduct 1.5 percent of any amount covered into the Iraq Claims Fund to satisfy claims under this title. (b) Deductions Treated as Miscellaneous Receipts.--Amounts deducted pursuant to subsection (a) shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. SEC. 806. PAYMENTS. (a) In General.--The United States Commission shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury each award made pursuant to section 802. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make payment, out of the Iraq Claims Fund, in the following order of priority to the extent funds are available in such fund: (1) Payment of $10,000 or the principal amount of the award, whichever is less. (2) For each claim that has priority under section 802(c), payment of an additional $90,000 toward the unpaid balance of the principal amount of the award. (3) Payments from time to time in ratable proportions on account of the unpaid balance of the principal amounts of all awards according to the proportions which the unpaid balance of such awards bear to the total amount in the Iraq Claims Fund that is available for distribution at the time such payments are made. (4) After payment has been made of the principal amounts of all such awards, pro rata payments on account of accrued interest on such awards as bear interest. (b) Unsatisfied Claims.--Payment of any award made pursuant to this title shall not extinguish any unsatisfied claim, or be construed to have divested any claimant, or the United States on his or her behalf, of any rights against the Government of Iraq with respect to any unsatisfied claim. SEC. 807. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER RECORDS. The head of any Executive agency may transfer or otherwise make available to the United States Commission such records and documents relating to claims authorized to be determined under this title as may be required by the United States Commission in carrying out its functions under this title. SEC. 808. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNUSED FUNDS. (a) Statute of Limitations.--Any demand or claim for payment on account of an award that is certified under this title shall be barred on and after the date that is one year after the date of publication of the notice required by subsection (b). (b) Publication of Notice.-- (1) In general.--At the end of the 9-year period specified in paragraph (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish a notice in the Federal Register detailing the statute of limitations provided for in subsection (a) and identifying the claim numbers of, and the names of the claimants holding, unpaid certified claims. (2) Publication date.--The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be published 9 years after the last date on which the Secretary of the Treasury covers into the Iraq Claims Fund amounts allocated to that fund pursuant to section 803(b). (c) Disposition of Unused Funds.-- (1) Disposition.--At the end of the 2-year period beginning on the publication date of the notice required by subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury shall dispose of all unused funds described in paragraph (2) by depositing in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts any such funds that are not used for payments of certified claims under this title. (2) Unused funds.--The unused funds referred to in paragraph (1) are any remaining balance in the Iraq Claims Fund. SEC. 809. DEFINITIONS. As used in this title: (1) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has the meaning given that term by section 105 of title 5, United States Code. (2) Government of iraq.--The term ``Government of Iraq'' includes agencies, instrumentalities, and entities controlled by that government (including public sector enterprises). (3) United nations commission.--The term ``United Nations Commission'' means the United Nations Compensation Commission established pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (1991). (4) United states commission.--The term ``United States Commission'' means the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 247, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) and a Member opposed will each control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, since 1990, over $1 billion in frozen Iraqi assets sitting in American banks have been available to satisfy the just claims of American citizens. But almost a decade later, this Congress has still not approved legislation that would let Americans collect. This amendment would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to vest this Iraqi money in an account known as the Iraqi Claims Fund and authorize the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to begin the process of resolving these claims against that Iraqi money with just one stipulation: The first claims to be resolved should be those of our Desert Storm and Desert Shield veterans, many of whom have been plagued with all the physical ailments that are referred to as Gulf War Syndrome. Mr. Chairman, these men and women gave their all against an enemy of the United States, and now these brave veterans deserve nothing less from the government of the United States. The House has already gone on record twice to support this objective. In 1994, by a vote of 398 to 5, in support of a similar provision in a State Department bill, and in 1997, in support of my motion to instruct conferees to reject an outrageous Senate provision in the State Department authorization bill by a vote of 412 to 5, we stood up at those times and declared that the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country are second to no one. Now we must do so again. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the distinguished ranking member on the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and allowing me to speak on this very important issue. What we do today on this amendment not only draws a lot of attention but it sends a sincere and straigthforward message to those young men and young women who today find themselves in uniform defending the interests of the United States of America. The money is there, Mr. Chairman. The fund is there. What is wrong with following the precedent that we have already set by voting in this House to allow that trust fund to be created from the Iraqi funds in order to take care of those young men and young women who might well be suffering from the Gulf War Syndrome? Saddam Hussein, the country of Iraqi, did very, very wrong, and the Americans righted that wrong by getting them out of Kuwait. But in the process, those young men and young women, those veterans of that conflict, as a result of the toxics that they ingested in themselves, became victims. And I certainly think we can follow through and help them reclaim what is rightfully theirs; the dollars from that fund. {time} 1600 Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, if no one is claiming time in opposition to this bill, I ask unanimous consent to control the 5 minutes allocated for opposition. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Washington). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) is recognized for an additional 5 minutes. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). The intent of this amendment is clear, to give our veterans in the Persian Gulf War first priority in seeking [[Page 17062]] claims against Iraqi assets frozen by our Government during the war. This amendment has the strong support of veterans groups, including Gulf War veterans. They know that while we can never make up the losses that were incurred in the Gulf War, veterans and their families should have the assurances that we will continue to seek every chance to collect damages against those injuries that they have suffered from. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) who represents the largest military base in the world, Ft. Hood, Texas. Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, it is not good enough to honor veterans on just Veterans' Day and Memorial Day. It is not good enough to just honor veterans with our speeches and our words. It is time we honored veterans with our actions. Veterans do not need our rhetoric. They need our support. A vote for the Doggett amendment today is a vote to put veterans first where they should be. We have a clear choice. We can vote to give Desert Storm and Desert Shield veterans first claim on $1 billion of frozen Iraqi assets, or we can vote to let countries who sold cigarettes to Saddam Hussein put their claims before our American veterans. We can vote to support those who put their lives on the line fighting against Saddam Hussein, or we can vote to support those who made profits selling to Saddam Hussein. Whose side are we on? That is the question before us. American veterans who were on the front lines in fighting against Saddam should not be put in the back of the line when Iraqi assets are unfrozen. Vote for our veterans. Vote for the Doggett amendment. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), the ranking member on the Committee on International Relations. Mr. GEJDENSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) for bringing this to the floor. This is the right action to take here. We ask our military personnel to take the first action in defending America's interests, the West's interests, our economic interests, our political interests, and our security interests. They should not be anyplace else in line but first when it comes to claiming their duly deserved compensation. This is an excellent amendment. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) is doing the right thing, and we should unanimously support him. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains, Mr. Chairman? The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) has 6 minutes remaining. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, it appears that no one will rise to speak against this amendment. I am pleased about that, and I know that our Nation's veterans will be pleased about it. The Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Gulf Veterans Resource Center have been active in supporting this measure. When this measure came before the Committee on International Affairs back in 1993, these organizations and other veterans organizations spoke out in favor of this provision. Yet, why is it that with such strong support from veterans, with a near unanimous vote of this House in 1994 on a strong bipartisan basis, again on my motion in 1997 a strong bipartisan basis, we have not provided our veterans with the mechanism to have a chance to get some recovery from the frozen assets of Saddam Hussein that are sitting in banks right here in the United States? It is because there are some who have claims that are competing with the veterans and do not want veterans to have a first claim on these assets. Some of the entities that have registered their claims with regard to these assets are the very companies that supplied Saddam Hussein with the means to have weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons, components that could be used in the development of nuclear weaponry, conventional weapons that were made available to Saddam Hussein. They now are competing with our veterans. Another group of entities that are competing and seem to have played a big role in this bill during the last Congress are the major tobacco companies. They also have claims. One has a claim of some $12 million. Now, I am not suggesting that any of those, even those that supplied Saddam Hussein with the means for his war machine, ought not to have their day in court or the day before the commission. But I am suggesting that before they have their day in court we should at least resolve the claims of those who put their lives on the line and some of whom actually sacrificed and gave their lives and others of whom will be plagued for the rest of their lives, bright young men and women with a shining future who now suffer disability as the result of Gulf War Syndrome. I would say, as to those young men and women who gave their all to this country, who put their country first and made this sacrifice, that they deserve to have their claims put ahead of the companies that supplied weaponry and the means to develop weaponry to Saddam Hussein and that they deserve to be placed ahead of the major tobacco companies that say they want their claims settled, not that they are left out, but that our veterans go first. I know that there are others across this Capitol, Mr. Jesse Helms in particular, that disagree with this approach. But I believe this House, for a third time having spoken out with, I hope, a unanimous voice and a recorded vote, will be sending a message that we will not leave our veterans behind anymore and that, as we close out this millennium, we will finally put our Gulf War veterans first and let them have a claim, a legitimate claim, against these assets of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards). Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the gentleman for his efforts. I would like to point out that I think it is outrageous if Members do not have the courage to come in the light of day on the floor of this House to say they oppose the amendment of the gentleman, an effort to put veterans first, and yet behind closed doors in conference committee this effort seems to be killed. I would hope that the silence and opposition to this amendment would indicate that this will pass through the conference committee. I hope that the veterans organizations in America will be watching this effort very, very carefully. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. EDWARDS. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman to respond to this question. I believe the gentleman was here on the floor in 1997 when we had our motion to instruct. It took up an entire hour of time. Am I not correct that, in the course of that debate, only one Member of this entire House on either side of the aisle or a Republican colleague of ours rose to oppose the motion to instruct and after the debate he voted with us in favor of the motion to instruct to tell Jesse Helms and all the members of the conference committee do not put veterans last, because if we put them last, given the size of the claims of some of these companies that helped fuel Saddam Hussein's war machine and supplied tobacco to the children and adults of Iraq, if we put the veterans down behind them, the veterans will not get a penny; it will not be a matter of putting veterans last, it will be a matter of putting veterans out and they will never get a dime? Is that not correct? Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, that is correct. It is my hope, Mr. Chairman, that every major veterans group in American will watch like a hawk what happens in conference committee on this. It would be unfair and morally wrong to our Nation's veterans to take this language out in conference committee. [[Page 17063]] Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 247, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. It is now in order to consider Amendment No. 37 printed in Part B of House Report 106-235. Amendment No. 37 Offered by Mr. Engel Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Part B amendment No. 37 offered by Mr. Engel: Page 84, after line 16, add the following (and conform the table of contents accordingly): SEC. 703. KOSOVAR ALBANIAN PRISONERS HELD IN SERBIA. (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings: (1) At the conclusion of the NATO campaign to halt the Serbian and Yugoslav ethnic cleansing in Kosova, a large, but undetermined number of Kosovar Albanians held in Serbian prisons in Kosova were taken from Kosova before and during the withdrawal of Serbian and Yugoslav police and military forces from Kosova. (2) Serbian Justice Minister Dragoljub Jankovic has admitted that 1,860 prisoners were brought to Serbia from Kosova on June 10, 1999, the day Serbian and Yugoslav police and military forces began their withdrawal from Kosova. (3) International humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Human Rights Watch, have expressed serious concern with the detention of Kosovar Albanians in prisons in Serbia. (4) On June 25, 1999, Serbia released 166 of the detained Kosovar Albanian prisoners to the ICRC. (5) On July 10, 1999, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, comprised of parliamentarians from Across Europe, the United States and Canada, adopted a resolution calling upon Serbia and Yugoslavia, in accordance with international humanitarian law, to grant full, immediate and ongoing ICRC access to all prisoners held in relation to the Kosova crisis, to ensure the humane treatment of such prisoners, and to arrange for the release of all such prisoners. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) the Serbian and Yugoslav Governments should immediately account for all Kosovar Albanians held in their prisons and treat them in accordance with all applicable international standards; (2) the ICRC should be given full, immediate, and ongoing access to all Kosovar Albanians held in Serbian and Yugoslav prisons; and (3) all Kosovar Albanians held in Serbian and Yugoslav prisons should be released and returned to Kosova. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 247, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the Engel amendment although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Chairman, after the allies won the war in Kosovo, when the Serbian forces left Kosovo to go back to Serbia, they kidnapped anywhere from 1,800 prisoners, Kosovar Albanian prisoners, to up to 5,000 Kosovar Albanian prisoners, and took them back to Serbia, away from their homes, and jailed them. The Serbian justice minister mentions a total of 1,860 Kosovar Albanians jailed. But I have from a very respected newspaper, Koha Ditore, a list of 5,000 ethnic Albanian prisoners who are now detained in jails in Serbia. This amendment simply would call on the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit these prisoners to call for an accounting of these prisoners and to give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all Kosovar Albanians detained in Serbian prisons. It also asks for the release and return to Kosovo of all these people and is virtually identical to a resolution that was passed by the OSCE recently which contained the same provisions and was the European parliamentarians' same request. We cannot allow Slobodan Milosevic to capture these people and to keep them there as virtual prisoners. It is absolutely important that the world community stand up and say that we will not tolerate the continued Serbian aggression. Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the list of prisoners and two articles, one from the Washington Post and one from the Los Angeles Times, which highlights this problem and the problem of the Kosovar Albanians who are captured and kidnapped in Serbian prisons. The List of Kosovar Prisoners Held in Serbia Taken From Koha Ditore City Prison-Pozharevc (Serbia): Lutfi Xhaferi, Muhamet Bajrami, Fadil Salihu, Naser Osmani, Rijad Begu, Isak Abazi, Xhemshit Ferati,

Serbia shuffled into the deputy warden's office today, her boots missing their laces and her hands clasped behind her back. She was pale and her fingers trembled, but she was defiant and angry. Flore Brovina, a middle-aged pediatrician and poet with dyed blond hair, beloved in her native Kosovo but accused of being an enemy of the state by Yugoslav authorities, is among hundreds of ethnic Albanians who were taken from jails in Kosovo in the last days of the war last month and moved to prisons in Serbia. Brovina is among the lucky ones; she has been found. Most of the prisoners have yet to [[Page 17067]] be accounted for, and they are among the larger ranks of missing ethnic Albanians whose fate is one of the great human rights mysteries of the Kosovo conflict. Over the three months of war, thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, mostly men of fighting age, were pulled from their homes and from columns of refugees streaming into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. They vanished without a trace. Some were killed, and only the digging in graves and forensic investigations will tell their stories. But many were incarcerated in seven prisons around Kosovo. Many were held without formal charges, allowed under a martial law decree that governed Yugoslavia during the war. At war's end, as NATO forces advanced into Kosovo province, some prisoners escaped--how many is unknown. At least 800 were marched to the Albanian border and released by Yugoslav security forces. The rest were taken in a long convoy of buses and trucks to Serbia. Today, Brovina took a seat before her captors and announced to her first visitor since her arrest in April, ``I do not consider myself a prisoner, but a slave.'' She said, ``I have only one question: Why am I here?'' For the next two hours, as the deputy warden and a guard by turns grimaced with shame or anger, disbelief or disgust, Brovina, 50, described her journey through the Serbian criminal justice system, where she is charged with being a terrorist. Serbian Justice Minister Dragoljub Jankovic said in an interview this week that his staff has accounted for 1,860 prisoners brought to Serbia from Kosovo on June 10, the day Yugoslav forces began withdrawing from the province. The prisons of Kosovo are now empty, and the largest, at Istok, was bombed into rubble--and prisoners killed--by NATO airstrikes in late May. According to Jankovic, there are 800 of the missing at the prison here in Pozarevac; 400 in Nis; 330 in Sremska Mitrovica; 180 in Leskovac; 95 in Prokuplje; and 55 in Zajecar. These cities are all in Serbia. The minister said he will soon turn over the names and locations, still being tabulated, to the International Committee for the Red Cross. The 1,860--or more--brought to Serbia from Kosovo are approximately the same number of missing prisoners circulating among humanitarian groups and lawyers in Serbia and Kosovo, its southern province. But even Jankovic acknowledged the final tally may grow. He said that many prisoners were moved, but their case files and other documentation, including investigative and trial proceedings, were lost in the race by Yugoslav forces and Serbian authorities to withdraw from Kosovo. Serbia is the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation. ``We're doing the best we can under very difficult circumstances,'' Jankovic said. The Belgrade government released 166 ethnic Albanian prisoners in June. Jankovic said another 200 would probably be freed soon. The chief warden here, Stipe Marusic, said he received 647 prisoners from Kosovo on the last day of the war, of which 579 were ethnic Albanians, most of whom are not yet convicted of any crime but are listed on his manifests as ``detainees'' or ``under investigation.'' Others are simply prisoners arrested in the last four months by the Serbian special police. ``We expect some to be convicted'' of charges of terrorist activities, he said, ``and some to be exchanged.'' Human rights activists here and in Kosovo have faulted NATO leaders for not including in the peace accords more language about what is to be done with the prisoners. Brovina said she believed they were being held as ``bargaining chips,'' and were being ``fattened'' up in Serbian prisons before some are eventually released. For weeks, Brovina's lawyer was not sure where she was. The Serbian Ministry of Justice could not find her. Confused about her misspelled name, the authorities said they were looking for a man, Jankovic assisted a reported in finding Brovina. Brovina has been in trouble with Serbian authorities since the early 1990s, when ethnic Albanians in Kosovo began actively resisting a decree by Slobodan Milosevic, who was then president of Serbia, to strip the province of its limited autonomy and bring the majority ethnic Albanian population to heel. In the purges that followed, Brovina was fired from her job at the hospital in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, but then founded the League of Albania Women, which sponsored protests against massacres and repression. She also opened a center for vulnerable women and children. ``Our slogan was very simple,'' she said. ``It was STOP.'' Brovina said they just wanted peace. But she admitted today that her sympathies clearly lie with the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, which battled Yugoslav forces for 16 months in an effort to win independence. ``We didn't have anything to do with the KLA.'' Brovina said. ``But if those were our sons, our husbands, our fathers, of course we liked them.'' Brovina remained in Pristina at the start of the NATO airstrikes on March 24. But on April 20, she was arrested. She was taken to he prison in Lipljan, on the outskirts of Pristina. She claims to have seen ethnic Albanian prisoners, arrested under Articles 125 and 136 as terrorist enemies of the state, lying naked on the floor, being beaten with ropes on the genitals in cells in the Lipljan jail. She charges that the Yugoslav army erected an antiaircraft battery at the prison. ``We were not prisoners,'' she said. ``We were made targets.'' Brovina said the prisoners at Lipljan were forced to say ``Long Live Serbia'' before they were allowed to use the toilets. Many complained about the food and the stingy rations, but Brovina and her warden agreed that the whole Kosovo was doing without. At the prison here today, two men held in Lipljan gave differing accounts. Neither saw an antiaircraft battery or soldiers, but one man, Hajdari Mursel, 63, a retiree, said he spent two weeks at Lipljan, where the guards ``screwed with us,'' and ``beat people with rubber hoses.'' All prisoners at Lipljan said that conditions there were much worse than in their new Serbian jails. Indeed, several prisoners went out of their way to say that they were well treated here at Pozarevac. ``They have not harassed me in any way,'' said Becir Bilalli, 44, the owner of a small shop. ``I have only one problem now, that I am away from my family, and these charges against me.'' Bilalli said that he was arrested at a checkpoint outside Kosovska Mitrovica in Kosovo last August. He is charged with terrorist activities. The reason, Bilalli said, is that like many in Kosovo he stood duty with a rifle on his shoulder outside his village at night. ``Everybody was on guard in Kosovo,'' he said. Bilalli, like the other prisoners, said he has not communicated with his family since the NATO air war began, and that he does not know where his wife and sons are. They do not know he is in prison in Serbia. On the eve of the final withdrawal of all Yugoslav army and security forces from Kosovo on June 10, Brovina and hundreds of other prisoners were loaded onto buses and driven to other parts of Serbia. They were ordered to keep their heads down, Brovina said, and told not to look out of the windows. ``We did not know where we were being taken,'' she said. Some prisoners feared they would be taken to a field and shot. Others wore all their clothes so that in event they were beaten, the blows would not be as punishing. There were few women in the prison convoys, Borvina said, but all the young ones feared they might be raped. There were not. Many of the 579 ethnic Albanians taken to this prison came from Dubrava prison in the Kosovo town of Istok. Before the war, the Istok prison was the largest, and most modern, in Serbia. Built on the Swedish model, the prison had recreation rooms, a motel for conjugal visits and a decent library. Enver Ramadani, 21, who was convicted of racketeering before the war, and confessed today he was indeed guilty of the crime, was at Istok. He called the prison ``super.'' But that was before the NATO bombing. In late May, Istok prison was hit for five days by NATO airstrikes. The exact number of dead and wounded are still unknown. What is known is that the prison was filled with prisoners, many of them ethnic Albanians detained in the last weeks of the war. Initially, Serbian officials said that 44 prisoners and guards were killed. Jankovic, the Serbian justice minister, said his latest information is that only six were killed, and 196 wounded, 20 seriously. Ramadani said that he saw 30 dead bodies in the prison yard, covered from the sun by blankets. For five days, NATO bombed, and he described a scene from hell: The guards fled into the woods, leaving the prisoners to fend for themselves. They raided the kitchens. They hid from the bombs down manholes into the sewers, packed like rats, waiting for the concussions to end. He said that many were wounded and were treated by ``so-called doctors'' among them, who did the best they could. There was blood everywhere. Ramadani did not see prisoners executed by Serbian security forces, although reporters who returned to Istok saw bullet holes in the walls and bloody mattresses, where heads would have lain. Jankovic said that for the five days of the bombing, his people were not in charge. He does not know what happened during the bombardment, and seemed to suggest that if any atrocities occurred, it was others--special police, paramilitaries--who were responsible. NATO officials stated that the site was a legitimate military target. ``That was a military barrack, and we attacked it twice,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea after the initial bombings. ``Whether the Serbs were using it to house other people--that's a different thing.'' Husnija, an ethnic Albanian attorney working in Serbia and Brovina's newly appointed lawyer, said that one of the most disturbing things he has uncovered is that during the war, Serb prisoners in Kosovo were moved north to Serbia, while ethnic Albanians incarcerated in Serbia were moved to Kosovo. He does not know why. Natasa Kandic, a human rights attorney based in Belgrade, said that she initially feared that many of the missing were dead. [[Page 17068]] Now, she believes they are in prisons around Serbia. That is not good, she said, but it is better than the missing being found in mass graves. ____ [From the Los Angeles Times, July 9, 1999] Detainees Lost in Maze of Yugoslav Prison System (By Mark Fineman) Belgrade, Yugoslavia.--When they boarded the Fati Tours bus from Slovenia to Kosovo last July, Baljaj Naim, Zogaj Enver and Hrecaj Haljit were much like the 51 other ethnic Albanian passengers. Like the others, the three men were contract workers going home--their pockets full of hard-earned construction wages-- to wives, children and parents they hadn't seen for months. But nearly a year after all the workers were detained at a Serbian police checkpoint in Kosovo on suspicion of being terrorists, the three men and 12 others still haven't made it home. After a torturous eight months of trials and appeals that moved them from prison to prison, the 15 men--who were convicted on vague terrorist charges just weeks before NATO launched its air war March 24--personify the problem now known simply as ``the prisoners.'' They are among an estimated 2,000 ethnic Albanian detainees and convicts who, the Yugoslav government acknowledges, were in Kosovo's prisons during NATO's air war. An undetermined number of those prisoners were moved to jails elsewhere in Serbia during the final weeks of the conflict. The fate of imprisoned ethnic Albanians is moving to center stage in the aftermath of NATO's war on Yugoslavia. And the saga of the men from the bus, say their lawyers here, epitomizes their advocates' frustrated search for justice. Eight of the 15 passengers, missing since May, finally turned up this week in a Serbian prison in Nis. The other seven--including Naim, Enver and Haljit--simple vanished in the chaos and killing that was Kosovo during and after NATO's 11-week air war. They are among hundreds of prisoners whose fate is unknown. On Thursday, the head of an International Committee of the Red Cross delegation, which interviewed its first 330 ethnic Albanian prisoners in Serbia this week, said tracing the rest and resolving their cases rank among the most enduring and confounding problems of the postwar period. ``It's Benedictine work,'' Dominique Dufour said. ``This will probably keep us busy for many, many years to come.'' Compounding the problem, he and other Western officials said, is the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Yugoslav officials never addressed the issue of the ethnic Albanian prisoners when they negotiated the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo last month. ``The attitude of the Serbian government about these Albanian prisoners is, `We are holding a number of Yugoslav citizens detained within Yugoslavia and still being detained within Yugoslavia for crimes committed in Yugoslavia,' '' explained Dufour, who stressed that the Justice Ministry of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, has been cooperating in the effort to trace them. ``So now, in their eyes, you're talking about some form of amnesty,'' Dufour said. ``But there was no agreement reached between the Western powers and Yugoslavia regarding these prisoners, and there probably needs to be.'' Human rights workers in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia say that, in addition to prisoners who were formally charged before and during the air war, Serbian authorities searching for members and supporters of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, plucked hundreds of ethnic Albanian refugees out of the columns of those fleeing last spring and detained them despite having little or no known documentation of a crime. Serbian authorities have, in fact, released about 1,000 of those prisoners in recent weeks: About 800 were freed near the Albanian border last month as Yugoslav troops withdrew from the province, and 166 prisoners were turned over to the Red Cross here this month. The Yugoslav government says the issue is further complicated by the rapid withdrawal from the province last month of Yugoslav troops, court personnel and judicial staff, which left prisoners' court files in disarray. But Dufour and others working to resolve the issue say that, in most of the cases involving ethnic Albanian prisoners who were removed from Kosovo or are missing, Serbian authorities kept detailed records of court proceedings and prisoner transfers. Justice Ministry officials, defense lawyers and the Red Cross are working to reconstruct the records. Extensive court records exist in the case of the 15 ``terrorists'' seized from the Fati Tours bus. The records obtained by The Times, help illustrate just why so many ethnic Albanians landed in prisons in the first place. Combined with witness accounts during the war and other documents here, the records also indicate that NATO might have helped obscure the fate of those prisoners and hundreds of other missing ethnic Albanians when its warplanes bombed Kosovo's largest prison, in the town of Istok, at the height of the air war. For the Fati 15, returning last year to the province with pockets filled with wages, the nightmare began when they reached a Serbian police checkpoint in the city of Podujevo on July 20 during heavy fighting between Yugoslav forces and KLA rebels. Here's how the Serbian judge, who found all 15 guilty after a four-day trial in February, described in this final judgment what happened next: ``Police stopped them. They checked the passengers and luggage and found on them the hard currency. [Police] immediately understood that it was being carried to Kosovo, that they were bound to join the terrorist organization [KLA] to buy arms and ammunition for the hard currency. They were escorted to Pristina . . . and arrests ensued.'' After an investigation that lasted months--during which Serbia's justice minister labeled the 15 passengers ``terrorists'' in an article that appeared in a state-run newspaper months before the trial--prosecutors dropped all charges against 39 other passengers and released them. For the remaining 15, the court record shows, not a single witness testified against them during their trial in the Serbian city of Prokuplje, about 120 miles southeast of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia and Serbia. No hard evidence was introduced linking them to the KLA, and the judge wrote that his guilty finding was based on the $56,000 worth of German marks the men carried, the fact that they were construction workers who left Slovenia at the height of that former Yugoslav republic's building season, and that they were ``smuggling'' the money into Yugoslavia ``in their pockets.'' In his appeal to Serbia's Supreme Court in April, the passengers' Belgrade-based ethnic Albanian lawyer, Husniya Bitic, called the verdict ``totally upside down . . . an attack on the legal system and the state . . . a political pamphlet or a speech of some political leader at one of his [Serbian] nationalist rallies.'' Bitic stressed in his Supreme Court brief that few of the 54 passengers knew each other when they boarded the bus; that witnesses told the court that the cash was for the workers families and for the families of their co-workers; that the money had come from performing legitimate construction work; and that the bus was on a regularly scheduled, twice-weekly route. ``Had such a verdict been delivered somewhere in Afghanistan [or] Papua New Guinea . . . perhaps it may be said this was being done by people who know nothing of the law,'' Bitic stated in the appeal. ``But for such a verdict to be passed in the middle of civilized Europe . . . this we could not expect.'' That was in April, after NATO had begun bombing Yugoslavia. The court rejected the appeal, and the 15 men continued to serve sentences ranging from 3\\1/2\\ to 4 years. Then the real trouble started. ``Until April 23, those 15 people were in Prokuplje,'' Bitic said here Wednesday. ``On April 26, they moved them to Istok. And on June 10, all prisons in Kosovo were deserted. Until today, I've only found eight of them in prison in Nis. I'm still searching for the others.'' Given what happened at Istok's Dubrava penitentiary on May 19, it's a miracle Bitic managed to find the eight. NATO bombed the prison several times that day, and foreign journalists who visited the scene between bombing runs described tense, hellish scenes of prison guards struggling to control about 1,000 inmates after the bombs killed 19 inmates and guards, breached the prison wall and left the facility's records in ruin. When asked that day why NATO had bombed the modern, Swedish-built prison complex, which was widely known throughout Europe as one of the continent's largest such facilities, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea replied: ``That was a military barracks, and we attacked it twice. . . . Whether the Serbs were using it to house other people--that's a different thing.'' But the overwhelming majority of the 1,004 inmates that Serbian authorities and the Red Cross say were being held in Dubrava when the bombs fell were ethnic Albanians. Most of them were like the Fati 15, charged or convicted under counter-terrorism laws. Western reporters and camera crews who visited the abandoned prison after the Yugoslav withdrawal found bullet-pocked walls, bloodied bedclothes and other signs of possible reprisals by prison guards. An Italian film crew also found 94 fresh, unmarked graves a few miles from the prison, where unconfirmed reports persist among villagers of an unsuccessful prison break and a massacre of inmates after the NATO bombardment. For Bitic, who is in touch almost daily with relatives of the missing seven, their case is ``a tremendous weight on my back. What will I tell the family? Well, at least for now, we're still looking.'' Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Engel amendment. Only last week we passed a resolution calling on Mr. Milosevic to release [[Page 17069]] the humanitarian workers for the CARE organization. Those workers had his thugs arrested and convicted. It is also reported that Milosevic's troops have imprisoned up to 2,000 citizens of Kosovo inside Serbia long after the war's end. Those prisoners must be released. Serb authorities must provide the Red Cross access to those prisoners and then turn them over to the custody of the U.N. Our committee is going to be taking a long look at the manner in which Milosevic has been holding on to power and ways in which we can help to bring the Democratic opposition to power through elections in Serbia. The world now knows Milosevic is a war criminal, and the list of his crimes will only grow as the investigations and investigators continue their work in Kosovo. This amendment serves notice that we are watching what is happening with regard to the 2,000 prisoners that he is holding. Accordingly, I urge our colleagues to fully support the Engel amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran). {time} 1615 Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time, but more importantly for his leadership on this issue. This is an important amendment. I would hope that it would pass unanimously. The gentleman from New York has mentioned a list of 5,000 people who are unaccounted for. We know the ruthless, lawless way in which the Serbian military, paramilitary and police have treated Kosovar Albanians. But these 5,000 people are represented by families, thousands of people who do not know whether their loved ones have been executed in any number of the brutal massacres that we know have occurred in Kosovo or whether they are being held in prison. If we allow access by the International Committee of the Red Cross, we will at least enable the parents, the families, to know what might have happened to their loved ones. It also means that we will be able to impose some limits on the conditions in which these people are living. There is a good reason why the Red Cross has not been allowed access, we are afraid, and, that is, that they do not want us to know what they are doing, how they are treating the prisoners in their jails. This is a good amendment and it should pass unanimously. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chairman of our Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Washington). The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 3\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank my very good friend for yielding me this time and rise in strong support of the Engel amendment and thank him for offering it to us this afternoon. Mr. Chairman, the people of Kosovo suffered greatly in the past 18 months, especially during the brutal ethnic cleansing campaign which paralleled the NATO air strikes from March to June of this year. While now is the time for Kosovars to return and rebuild their homes and their lives, many continue to be held in Serbian prisons, wrongly held, and illegally held. Over the 3 months of the conflict, thousands of Albanians in Kosovo, mostly men, were pulled from their homes and from columns of refugees. Some were killed and only the excavation of mass graves and subsequent forensic investigations will tell their stories. But many were incarcerated in seven prisons around Kosovo, without formal charges, under a martial law decree that governed Yugoslavia during the war. At war's end as NATO forces advanced into Kosovo province, some prisoners escaped, others were marched to the Albanian border and released by Yugoslav forces, and the rest were taken in a long convoy of buses and trucks to Serbia. We do not know the exact numbers, but these are the people that we speak to in this amendment. I would like to point out that recently I led a delegation to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE in St. Petersburg. I want to commend the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) because he was able to raise the issue during the course of those deliberations and we got language in the concluding document, the St. Petersburg Declaration, that raised this issue in a way that hopefully will get the attention of the entire international community and especially of Belgrade to let them go. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that the continued incarceration of Kosovar Albanians by Serbian authorities is in violation of the Geneva Conventions, as is the denial of outside access by other international observers like the Red Cross. This must be corrected. It is very important that we go on the record, hopefully unanimously, saying: Let these people go. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned before, the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, passed a resolution similar to our amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), the author of that resolution. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) for authoring this amendment. It is a very important amendment. It does carry out what we have done in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. Mr. Chairman, international organizations, including U.N. officials, have reported that between 1,500 to 5,000 prisoners were transferred from Kosovo to jails in Serbia around the time of the entry of international forces into Kosovo and that the Serbian Ministry of Justice has acknowledged that such transfers were made. International humanitarian law requires humane treatment of all prisoners seized in conjunction with the Kosovo crisis, and Red Cross access to such prisoners is guaranteed under international law. They must be released without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. That has not occurred. The Belgrade authorities have provided inaccurate lists and have not allowed access by the Red Cross. The illegal detention of these individuals is unacceptable. The OSCE has adopted a resolution that I authored on behalf of the United States delegation, a very similar resolution. It is time that the United States Congress also acts. I encourage my colleagues to approve this resolution. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Without objection, both sides will be granted an additional 2 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver). Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the indulgence of the body for that additional time. This resolution seems not to have any significant opposition and I assume it is going to be adopted unanimously, but I thought I would make just a couple of comments and also describe a little bit of the experience of the congressional delegation that went to Kosovo that was built out of the leadership of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction of the Committee on Appropriations of which I am the ranking member just a matter of a week or so ago. The men and boys that are involved in this resolution are those largely that were randomly pulled from columns of refugees and taken without trial, held without trial, without contact as an act really of terrorism on the part of the paramilitary Serbian forces at that time. Now, they should be released. They should be, and we should adopt that resolution unanimously. If there are [[Page 17070]] problems, if there are people who were actively law-breakers, then what should happen is that the detention process that is happening in every one of the occupation zones in Kosovo should take over. We visited a detention camp where there were several Serbs and about twice as many Albanian ethnics, Kosovars, who were being detained because they had committed some crime, which could have been murder or arson or robbery or whatever after the agreement had been reached. And ultimately if there are people who have committed a crime, they should be dealt with in the same way because we need to build a system, a legal system in which people can trust. I would hope that this amendment would be adopted unanimously without dissent. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank my colleagues. This obviously is supported on both sides of the aisle very strongly. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his wonderful work on human rights and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and all the people on both sides of the aisle who have supported this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Kelly). Mrs. KELLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my colleague and good friend from New York. The Kosovar Albanians that are being held in the Serbian prisons must be released and accounted for. Think of the agony felt by the families of these 5,000 men who do not know what happened to their fathers, husbands and sons. The events that have taken place that have affected the families in Kosovo during the last several years have been atrocious and we cannot stand by and continue to allow this blatant disregard for the peace agreement. With the implementation of the Military Technical Agreement on June 9, the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo have been working to bring peace and stability back to this historically troubled region, but this job has only begun. The Kosovar Albanians held in these prisons are there without any formal charge, are being held in clear violation of international law, and this can only prove to erode the faith in the peace agreement. Mr. Chairman, despite the end of the military action that the international community had engaged in to bring about an end of the Serbian aggression, the war is not over for these 5,000 people. They still have a long way to go, they have lived through a terrible time, until they can live in peace and not fear for their safety. Mr. Chairman, Congress has to weigh in on this important issue. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel). The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 247, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) will be postponed. Amendments En Bloc Offered by Mr. Gilman Mr. GILMAN.
