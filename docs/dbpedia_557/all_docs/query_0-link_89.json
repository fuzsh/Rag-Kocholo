Kristine Montgomery of Glendale Heights and Sheryl McCabe of Bensenville have been chosen by the college’s publication board to run CD’s weekly newspaper. Montgomery is the Courier’s editor-in-chief, while McCabe is the new managing editor. Only during the 1978-79 school year did two females have editorial control of the college paper. Montgomery and McCabe succeed D. Randall Olson of Glen Ellyn and Moira Leen of Elmhurst, both of whom completed their studies at CD last June. Under their editorship, the Courier was named the best community college newspaper in the state in competition sponsored by the Illinois Community College Journalism Association. Montgomery, 19, is a January, 1981, graduate of Glenbard North High School, where she authored a column and did cartooning for the school newspaper. She has worked as a departmental aide for the village of Carol Stream. Montgomery plans to pursue a degree in communications from Columbia College in Chicago after finishing her course work at CD. McCabe, 18, was graduated in 1982 from Fenton High School, where she served as editor on the yearbook staff. She worked at CD during the last school year as secretary to the coordinator of the college’s respiratory therapy program. McCabe expects to complete her work for the bachelor’s degree at Northeastern Illinois University, where she will study journalism, art and religion. Honors program offered By GLORIA DONAHUE Four honors courses, designed to accommodate superior and highly motivated students, will be offered at the College of DuPage beginning next spring. This experimental program is now being developed by an honors commit¬ tee comprised of faculty members and a student government representative. The group, headed by Allan Carter, coordinator, will determine criteria for the honors project, including qualifica¬ tions, class size, courses and selection of instructors. Recommendations will be made to the Faculty Senate in December. CARTER EXPRESSED HOPE that the new program will attract high school honors students as well as “offer a more stimulating environment for current CD students who have proven themselves academically.” These courses will be limited in size. Honors programs at other colleges, noted Carter, “have demonstrated that smaller classes along with outstanding instructors, and highly competent classmates increase intellectual stimu¬ lation and motivate students to do excellent work.\" The honors courses will emphasize quality over quantity, providing a more comprehensive study of material, said Carter. Assignments will involve in- depth writing and research and “will encourage students to think, write and express themselves with clarity.” THE MAIN OBJECTIVE of the program is to develop initiative and self-reliance in learning, pointed out the humanities instructor. In addition, “it will increase interaction between faculty and students.” Students will also benefit by carrying an “H” on their transcript showing that they were enrolled in an honors section. This may facilitate a student’s transfer to a four-year college, said Carter. The honors committee will report the results of the program to the Faculty Senate by the end of the 1985 spring quarter. Carter said that any student who would be interested in helping plan the program should contact him at 858-2800, ext. 2379. The newly constructed physical education building is scheduled for completion within the next week while work on the student resource center is expected to continue until December, according to Ron Lemme, vice presi¬ dent of planning and information. The SRC, originally planned, for completion in March 1983, has been delayed by numerous structural changes, late deliveries and other unexpected problems, stated Lemme. Among them, was a three-week halt in building this summer when contractors pulled off the job because of delays in the receipt of state funding. “IT’S DIFFICULT, WHEN they set out to do a construction job three years in advance, to pinpoint exactly when it’s going to be done,” commented Lemme. “Things never seem to work out the way you’d like them to in construction.” Complete occupancy of the SRC facility is scheduled for Oct. 14, although the building itself is not expected to be completely finished until sometime in December. The learning resource center, already functional, and the cafeteria, due to open in late October, will be housed in the SRC along with headquarters for various student and administrative organiza¬ tions. The $10 million PE structure located to the west of Building A is 95 percent complete, according to Lemme. Prob¬ lems with heating for the indoor swimming pool and showers have contributed to the two-week delay in complete functioning of the facility which was originally scheduled to be operative in September. PE FACILITIES EXPECTED to be open for student and staff use within a week, said Lemme, include a main arena which contains basketball courts and an indoor track, a diving well, eight racquetball courts and rooms for weightlifting, dancing, and martial arts. Community use will not be available until January. Funding for the additions to the main campus were provided by local bond issues from previous years along with local taxes and tuition, according to Howard Owens, controller and director of finance. A fine arts building has been planned for future construction. Parking to help accommodate the new buildings has been opened to the west of the SRC. Lemme stated that further plans for additional parking areas are being considered.

Stevens Powder Box Yorktown Opinion The Courier/October 7, 1983 Editorial Parking for the birds The parking issue is College of DuPege’s perpetually beaten dead horse which happens to have one more flogging coming to it. Although parking on or near campus is not always a dire situation, for instance during mid-afternoons and some evenings, the majority of students arrive in the morning when the parking lots suddenly become a ridiculous maze-run competition with a mere parking slot as the coveted prize. Some 80 students were surveyed last week concerning the parking situation. When asked whether they found parking to be a problem, 51 percent said \"yes,” 29 percent responded “no,” and 20 percent said ‘ ‘occasionally. ’ ’ The students were also asked for suggestions to improve the situation. The most common remedies recommended were either reduce the number of cars (by carpooling), limit the number, of students, or create more parking areas. “Expand” was the recommendation uttered most frequently, although this utterance in the past has provoked little action. CD is not, however, totally inert to expand parking facilities since the lot west of the new PE building was recently opened. Many people feel more needs to be done. One alternative to expansion, which would depend on the commuters and not on CD administrators, is carpooling. Some 67 percent of those polled indicated they drive to school aloDe while 33 percent carpool or drive with a friend. Student Government has been making efforts to organize a carpooling system. If students seriously want to see congestion alleviated, they might consider such an arrangement. Another remedy suggested was limiting the number of students who enroll, particularly for morning classes, which would inevitably decrease the number of cars competing for space. Curbing enrollment is easy to suggest, but who wants to be denied a desired class? Most people surveyed believed creating more parking facilities would cure all commuter woes. Plenty of hilly land which could be leveled and paved over exists between the current lots and Building A. Some suggest adding lots around the perimeters of Building A or extending the lot behind the building. The rehashed argument that students have all the parking area necessary with the lots by Buildings J, K and M, sometimes gets tossed back to those who complain. However, as one student pointed out, “The excuse of having parking facilities across the street is invalid due to the distance.” The only people who should have to park in the J, K and M lots are those who have classes or other business to conduct in the we3t campus buildings. Now with the addition of the SRC and PE buildings and with the library and other rooms relocating from J and K, even more people will be vying for space near Building A. More than once the idea of a hi- or tri-level garage has been suggested. By charging students a daily fee of perhaps 25 cents, the garage would eventually be paid off. Some propose the structure could be built separately on vacant land or over one of the existing lots near Building A. The parking “problem” is, of course, a matter of perception. Some 29 percent surveyed see no problem. As one student stated, there are “many spaces, just too many people.” The concern here is not a lack of space. The true problem was pinpointed by another who wrote, “Everyone wants a close spot, and nobody likes to walk.” Another student said, that the CD situation was not bad at all compared to the last college she attended and claimed, “People are just too lazy to walk.” Some suggest that if a shuttle bus system ran from the buildings west of Lambert Road to Building A, more students would be willing to utilize the J, K and M lots. When asked if the parking dilemma caused one to be late for class, 53 percent answered “yes.” Another 25 percent admitted to parking illegally at one time or another. A few view the situation as a Other respondents posed questions, to which some possible answers are herewith submitted. Q: Why did anyone bother painting “compact” on the asphalt? A: Obviously for people with Chevy Impalas to disregard. But who can blame them? With such a chaotic system and time fleeting, who can afford to play categorical car-park? Q: Does “visitor parking” have to be so large a space? Where are all the people these special lots were designed for? A: Probably not and who knows? But it’s nice to feed the neighbors even if one’s own family goes hungry. Other problems besides places to park could stand some revision as well. Some students request that ropes or flaglines be mounted to better separate the aisles. Others would like to see the aisles labeled as is done in shopping mall lots. The posting of “This lot full” signs has been neglected this quarter, and the absence of officers is evident. Furthermore, nobody likes the person who takes up two parking spaces for his precious Trans-Am with the \"WILD 1” license plates. Anyone who is selfish enough to hog parking space in a CD lot should be ticketed. The college cannot afford to accommodate gluttonous parkers. The parking \"horse” has been dead for years but still solicits a beating from each wave of new students. The feasibility of the suggested solutions remains uncertain. Maybe nothing will or can be done, although something should. For those students who are “too lazy to walk,” we have here the quintessence of poor planning. A source revealed that one reason why the parking lots were laid out so far from the building is that the campus design \"looks beautiful from an aerial view.” How nice. And while some of us trudge through the slush and over the hill this winter to Building A from parking lot J, just think of how aesthetically pleasing the campus looks to all of the students who commute here by helicopter — and to the birds as they bead for Miami. Training is everything. The peach was once a hitter almond ; cauliflower is nothing hut cabbage with a college education. - Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) In an effort to present a diversity of viewpoints within its columns, the Courier invites students, staff and the community to submit guest opinion pieces on college-related issues as well as on topics dealing with local, state and international affairs.

Nyka News The Courier/October 7, 1983 5 PLR site considered By KRISTINE MONTGOMERY A task force to determine where the Prairie Light Review, CD’s literary magazine, will be housed was es¬ tablished by Student Government Sept. 28. The group will meet within the next two weeks to investigate available options. The committee includes SG members Jim Gomick, Dawn Porter, Ken Pfeiffer, Chuck Zimmerman, and PLR editors Margaret Hren and Marie Ford. PRAIRIE LIGHT REVIEW is a quarterly publication currently head¬ quartered on the lower floor of the Courier barn. The Courier will relocate to its new office in the SRC this winter; however, the PLR will face eviction when the bam is eventually tom down. When the SRC was being planned some four years ago, the PLR was not yet in existence, and therefore was not considered when SRC space was allocated. “We need a place to meet and discuss,” Hren stated. She stressed the need for a room to execute layout and a permanent place where students could drop off submissions. PLR adviser Allan Carter repeatedly emphasized the need for a permanent office where a desk, phone and file cabinet could be maintained. ALSO DISCUSSED WAS the problem of housing the equipment that will be uprooted when the bam is vacated. The Courier staff was approached with a proposal to share their quarters in the SRC with the PLR. Jim Nyka, Courier adviser, stated that the Courier staff concurred and was “thoroughly opposed to the idea” of sharing its office with the magazine. Nyka claimed that the Courier and PLR are separate entities which should function as such and that the Courier was not responsible for taking in the “orphan in the storm.” Daniel Lindsey, dean of humanities and liberal arts, said that to “superim¬ pose” the two publications would be unfair to both. ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS the four existing club rooms and the vacant rooms in Buildings K and J were discussed, but no solution was reached. Mark Geller, assistant coordinator of student activities, then suggested a task force be formed to further examine the viability of available options. The group also focused on the upcoming Fallfest Oct. 27 through 28. Lisa Etherton, SG director announced the proposed menu and also the confirmation of the event’s entertain¬ ment — Marshall Crenshaw and Phil ’N’ the Blanks — who will be the first bands to perform in the new PE arena. Executive Director Yvonne Anderson appointed Mike Pighini sergeant at arms, explaining his duties will include “keeping order during meetings” and “forcing disrupters to leave” if necessary. SHERRY KENNELLY AND Lou Gagliardi were appointed club reps by Patrick Coyne, SG president. Their job will be to act as a “buffer” between all clubs, SG and the board of directors, promoting “good relations” and aiding in the flow of communication. Also mentioned was the upcoming laser photo sale Oct. 10 through 14. Coyne announced he will attend the dedication of the new SRC and PE buildings Nov. 4 and that he and other officers would attend an ICCSAA conference in Springfield Sept. 30 to Oct. 1. Chuck Zimmerman reported that the recent pizza sale made a $74 profit. At a prior meeting on September 21, Ray Schoder resigned from the Board of Directors. ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ 4* ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ O <b .0° „ A0<?f9»G°' 0* ^VV\\° , <K>e \\<° » -O.X .c.. ^ 9* ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ oN* ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ r W ***** C°t^ee%o^ 0^° ^ <aSc .^vr>r ^ 't.isKy 'cV **>■* Nfj^° _ S°VX vie Co College of DuPage 6 Arts The Courier/October 7, 1983 Allen’s 6 Zelig 9 low on laughs By SCOTT D. TOMKOWIAK Prior to viewing Woody Allen’s latest film “Zelig,” I hadn’t the slightest notion what the word “chameleon” meant. To paraphrase my dictionary, a chameleon is an Old World or American lizard with the unusual ability to alter its skin color. It also refers to a person who is fickle or changeable. With this movie, director Allen presents us a human chameleon, a psychotic character so intensely dedi¬ cated to blend in with all different groups of people that he becomes one of them, both in physical stature and mental capacity. In the meantime, Allen’s Zelig personification becomes a media attraction, more or less defeating his purpose to melt in with the crowd. ONE WOULD THINK that with such a potentially zany and unique personality in the fictional Leonard Zelig that Woody Allen has created a picture full of belly-laughs and guffaws. Not so. This film is decidedly low-brow in its humor while making an underlying statement on the media- created, over-night celebrity. The combination of Allen’s subtle, but off-beat comedy and his commenta- _ry of 1920s contemporary life comes off splendidly, boosted by a tremendous integration of historical newsreel stock footage. The format of the film is what makes it so refreshing. Set in the style of a documentary, the movie unfolds the story of Leonard Zelig (Allen) who could gradually become the same type of person he converses with. In the company of two obese men, his gut grows. In the midst of psychiatrists, he speaks their lingo. Intertwined with actual and re-created newsreel scenes are supposedly current interviews with the people responsible for Zelig’s emergence into the spotlight. These include various talks by psychiatrists, relatives and others. Even Chicagoan Saul Bellow appears to interject his thoughts. THE SPECIAL KIND of Allen wit does, however, pop up from time to time. His humor in key instances gives this film a proper balance and avoids the hazard of taking itself too seriously. There are, of course, the bits of newsreel scenes that have Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon, transform¬ ing himself from Caucasian to black to Oriental, et al. Moreover, some of the flick’s strongest gags occur early on, during which many psychiatrists are studying the Zelig enigma. The doctors attempt to poke an unimaginably long needle into him, causing their poor subject to cower in fright — they examine Zelig with a strange stethescope that has six different sets of earpieces. With all of these various probing techniques, the shrinks have their patient climbing the walls — literally. ONLY ONE DOCTOR is genuinely concerned with the embattled Zelig, and that is Eudora Fletcher (played by Allen’s girlfriend, Mia Farrow). She speculates that Zelig’s varying condi¬ tions are seated wholly within his subconscious, rather than being physically initiated. Fletcher’s therapy does, in time, pay off. It would have been much simpler for Woody Allen to make this film a standard period piece as opposed to a pseudo-documentary. The tricky part in attempting this sort of work is erasing any kind of sloppiness pertaining to the doctoring up of original 1920s still photos and newsreel footage. The viewer does a double-take when she sees Allen taking batting practice with Lou Gehrig or appearing next to a vocalizing Adolf Hitler. Ideally, one must remember that Woody Allen' is not the kind of filmmaker who would take an easy way out to tell a story.

Foster played only about three quarters of the game, but gained 166 yards on 14 carries for an 11.9 average. Lisbon came off the bench to rush for 58 yards on 11 tries, but the enthusiasm over the win was dampened by a first quarter injury to freshman quarterback Mike Buchholz, of Whea¬ ton, who went out with a leg injury and did not return. The victory gives DuPage a 3-2 record and a 2-1 mark in the North Central Community College Conference, one-half game behind league-leading Triton and Illinois Valley. The DuPage offense gained 296 yards rushing and 52 passing while the defense held Joliet to only 48 yards rushing on 49 attempts and 93 yards passing (eight of 24 attempts complet¬ ed). The tough Chaparral defense sacked Joliet quarterbacks 10 times for 83 yards in losses, and contributed 10 points to the effort. Sophomore linebacker Scott Moore of Wheaton recovered one fumble and returned his first interception of the year 20 yards for a touchdown. Teammate Joe Bergin, a freshman linebacker from York High School in Elmhurst, scored two points by sacking the opposition quarterback in the endzone for a safety. The defense accounted for yet another safety when the Joliet center hiked a snap over his punter’s head through the endzone for another score. Freshman receiver Alan Washer of Lane Tech High School scored Du- Page's other touchdown on a 32-yard pass from sophomore Jessie Schramer of West Chicago. The Chaps will play their first home game of the season at 1 p.m. Saturday, when they host the Harper College Hawks. CASIO NOW OFFERS STUDENT AID.

Trustees voted to spend $40,000 for the architectural services of Wight & Co., Downers Grove, which will guide the structure’s changeover. PLANNED IS THE expansion of facilities for Open College offices in Building J, including a conference center and seminar rooms for the Business and Professional Institute. Additional footage also will be allocated to Media Production, includ¬ ing the radio station and TV studio, and space will be provided for the print shop — now in Building K — and classrooms for the fire science program. The child care and development program, along with the student-parent co-op, will be given four rooms, in addition to a playground in the area on the east side of the building. A lounge and limited food service area also are planned. IN OTHER BUSINESS, the board discussed the development of “tele- learning” via radio, broadcast television and cable TV. Enrollment in both radio and broadcast television programs has increased over the last three years according to Russ Lundstrom, dean of academic alternatives. Six radio-delivered courses are pre¬ sently available, with two under revision and a music appreciation class being developed for future implementa¬ tion. Eleven TV courses are being offered with five new telecourses being considered for adoption this year. Gene Hallogren, associate dean of academic alternatives, noted that many of the television offerings may not be broadcast on TV or cable because of the availability of videotapes at local libraries and the LRC for viewing in a lab situation. Limits in developing broadcast TV were noted by President Harold Mc- Aninch. “I think the potential is far greater for us serving our people by using cable and radio,” said McAninch. ATTEMPTS TO GET programming on cable channel 60 are continuing in addition to CD’s membership in the channel 20 consortium of college television. The future progress of telelearning was included in a discussion of the potential use of satellite TV and videotapes used through microcom¬ puters. Trustee Evelyn Zerfoss expressed concern that “a terrible waste of time and energy” could occur in developing an area of media education such as cable that may become obsolete too soon because of progress in other areas of teleleaming. James Blaha, chairman of the board, suggested a quarterly report on the progress in these areas. VOL 17 NO 2 OCTOBER 14, 1983 COURIER COLLEGE OF DuPAGE JUDGED THE FINEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEWSPAPER IN ILLINOIS GLEN ELLYN, IL 60137 SG elections set for Oct. 18, 19 By KRISTINE MONTGOMERY Elections for the student government board of directors positions will be held Oct. 18 and 19 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. in entranceway 3. A student director is expected to participate on two SG committees, one college-wide committee, and must provide input into all SG functions. In the running are incumbents Dave Alder, Tina Lardizabal, Dawn Porter, and candidates Bob Kay, Chris Kunzer, Ken Norman, Jennifer Streff, Ron Strum, Jenn Szymanski, John Tyler and Denise Woodard. DAVE ADLER was graduated from high school in 1982 and is currently working toward a degree in manage¬ ment. Adler has served on the student board of directors for one, term and feels that his experience will be useful if he is elected. Adler said he would like to see “classes standardized and more thorough teacher evaluation.” BOB KAY was graduated from Naperville Central High School in 1981 and has since completed three quarters at CD. Kay worked as an assistant manager for a shoe store before he decided to return to college. He feels he is qualified for a director’s position because he has “the ability to work with and for people,” and because “I want some things done around here.” Kay claims he will bring “cooperation and a friendly attitude to my position every day. Hopefully, a better relation¬ ship between student government and students will occur if a smile is always there.” CHRIS KUNZER attended Naper¬ ville Central High School and has worked for Colonial Caterers in Naperville for two years. Kunzer served on the senior class council of ‘82 and ‘83, which generated some $3,100. He would like to bring “more unity to CD through more interesting activities,” and would like to see “more of a family atmosphere instead of a supermarket where people just come to classes.” TINA LARDIZABAL attended high school in Elmhurst and then in Tucson, Ariz., where she was graduated in 1981. In 1982, she returned to Illinois and enrolled at CD where she is majoring in pre-med. She recently worked in the public relations department at Wood- haven Lakes. During the summer quarter, Lardizabal was appointed to a director’s position and has since “established a strong working relation¬ ship with both the board and executive branch.” She is a member of the public relations committee and chairperson of the tutor program. If elected, Lardizabal plans to “serve as an effective ear to student ideas and opinions and actively voice ideas of merit to the board. I will help develop clear objectives and coordinate pro¬ grams that can produce measurable . results.” Considering changes, she sees \"a need for improved security in the parking lot, particularly at night. I will also help develop a more effective program for the verification of book ownership to eliminate the problem of book theft at the end of the quarter.” KEN NORMAN was graduated from Downers Grove High School in 1980 and has worked for Servicemaster, James’ Tavern, Jerome’s, and Mc¬ Cann’s construction. Norman said he is “interested in the rights of the students and I would like to have some influence to protect those rights.” He hopes to bring “creativity, a sense of humor, and an energetic personality” to his position if elected. DAWN M. PORTER was graduated from Hinsdale Central High School and has attended CD for one year. She formerly worked in the food service industry and also as a receptionist/file clerk. Porter served on the board of directors for 10 months, having functioned in a volunteer capacity prior to her appointment. As transportation committee chairperson, Porter rein¬ stated the carpool program and is “working very diligently at keeping it running. I am very in touch with the student body and know, in depth, their need.” As for changes, she said she “would like to see the board of directors work more closely with each other and with the executive board. I would also like more student recognition of student government and the services it provides.” JENNIFER STREFF attended Benet Academy and was graduated in 1980. She had a full-time office job for two years until she returned to school and now works in retail sales in Oak Brook. She ran for SG director once before and helped during SG “Casino Night.” Streff plans to bring “an objective view” to her job and hopes to “help students through student govern¬ ment.” Streff envisions “no major changes,” but hopes “to support student government responsibilities and help in executing any needful changes in the future.” RON STRUM attended Willowbrook High School and is in his first quarter at CD. Strum once worked for the park district in Villa Park and has been employed at the Grand Gazebo restaurant for the past year. In high school, Strum was active on the newspaper and on the yearbook staff, for which he was selected art editor and earned the U.S. Academy achievement award. As a student council representa¬ tive, Strum organized “The Magical Marathon Dance” which raised $2,000 for the Leukemia fund. He also helped run elections and served on various committees. “I would like to see more students get involved with CD’s activities, and I would like to see all students be aware of what is going on,” said Strum. JENN SZYMANSKI was graduated from Naperville Central High School in 1983. She has worked as a lifeguard and now is employed full time at Visions & Video. Szymanski served on her high school class council during her junior and senior years. She claims that because the senior council was “very successful,” they were able to have a mural painted on the gym wall and still have money left over for the next year’s class. “I am a reliable, honest person,” she said. “One must be dependable for this sort of job, and I feel I am capable of fulfilling this job’s needs.” She would like to see the acquisition of lab materials become more organized. “There is never enough,” she stated, “or the material is nowhere to be found.” JOHN TYLER attended York Com¬ munity High School in Elmhurst and words for Leonard’s Clothing Store for Men. Tyler has been involved with the Explorer Post 434 in Bensenville for three years and is presently serving as junior adviser. Because of his experi¬ ence with the Explorer club, Tyler feels he has gained knowledge and under¬ standing with students which will benefit him if elected to the student board. “I feel it’s very important that the students realize we’re here to help them,” he said. Tyler claims he is willing to listen and will “do all I can to help the students with any problems they may have.” DENISE WOODARD was graduated from Lake Park High School in 1982. This is her second year at CD. At one time, Woodard organized and executed programs for the Roselle Park District. She currently works at the Hanover Racquet Club. During her junior and senior years in high school, Woodard served on the class council. “I’m imaginative,” she said. “I listen and communicate well. I care about school, and I want to be involved.” Woodard proposes to bring her “ideas, time, effort and student feedback” to the job if elected. Considering changes, she says, “I’d like to find out more about the parking situation. I’d also like to know what’s going on with the cafeteria. Of course, as I learn more about the system and the school, I might suggest a few things toward bettering our school.” AMONG 11 CANDIDATES for SG board of directors election Oct. 18 and 19 are (l-r) front row: Dawn Porter, Ron Strum and Tina Lardiza¬ bal. Back row: Bob Kay, Jennifer Streff and Dave Alder.

Watch for our move to the new SRC The Courier/October 14, 1983 News ^ PLR relocation remains a problem By KRISTINE MONTGOMERY Student Government director Jim Gomick announced at the SG meeting Oct. 5 that although the task force created to solve the Prairie Light Review relocation dilemma had met during the week, no solution had been found. Gomick said the issue would have to be pursued “into the next coming months with Ronald Lemme,\" vice president of planning and information. UNTIL A DEFINITE decision is made, the PLR will “use a club room as an office,” Gomick said. “Lemme is the one who is really in charge of the situation.” Gomick predicted that the PLR issue would not be resolved “until the end of the quarter.” The possibility of relocation to Buildings J or K is still being considered; however, Lucile Friedli, coordinator of student activities, urged the task force to “give them a space within this school.” President Patrick Coyne requested the board “postpone any kind of vote” on the subject until a later date. Gornick ended the discussion by declaring, “We’ll get them a room.” COYNE REPORTED THAT the Sept. 30 trip to the ICCSAA conference in Springfield was “enjoyable.” He said he met many people from other community colleges and concluded that students are “very fortunate to have what we have.

Vice President Chuck Zimmerman, who also attended the conference, added that CD is “by far the best off community college in the state. We don’t have even one-fourth the problems these other schools have.” CD will host the ICCSAA conference next year. Lisa Etherton, SG director, an¬ nounced that the SG newsletter will be further delayed six to seven weeks due to problems acquiring letterhead. Later in the meeting, Etherton declined her candidacy for the upcoming election but said she will continue her work on Fallfest. FRIEDLI ASKED SG members to help during the SRC open house activities beginning Nov. 5 and added that other students should be encour¬ aged to assist during the events. Also present at the meeting were Richard Alves, Phi Theta Kappa president, and vice president Maria Cotaldo, who are working with SG to organize a tutor program. “All of the chapters should be doing this,” said Alves in a post-meeting interview. Phi Theta Kappa will have a booth set up at Fallfest Oct. 17 and 18 where students may pick up information about the fraternity. “I’m going to do everything possible to make CD students aware that there is a national honor fraternity available to them,” Alves said. Gornick resigned his position, claim¬ ing that outside pressures were hindering his SG duties. He stated that he “would like to see this unit continue” and that he is “behind Coyne 100 percent.” IMPROVE YOUR GRADES!

A Opinion The Courier/ October 14, 1983 Student irresponsibility increasing By SHARON COADY Ave says he can’t take the test today — when can he make it up? Susan wants to go to Florida next week — she’ll get notes on what she’ll miss from a friend when she gets back. Angie didn't get a chance to study last night — may she take the quiz tomorrow instead of today? Bob didn’t do too well on the test — when can he take it over? Student irresponsibility is a problem teachers have always complained about, but it seems to me it has grown remarkably worse during the past few years. In fact, irresponsible behavior seems to have increased in all parts of society as self-discipline and responsibility have lost power as social values. Nevertheless, I think that we in education have helped cause our own problem. We have focused so intently on teach¬ ing that we have relieved the student of the responsibility for learning. We have focused so intently on teaching that we have relieved the student of the responsibility for learning. With the flurry of experiments in the 1960s and the mania for objectives in the 1970s, we abandoned the teaching of such values as responsibility and embraced objectives that could be reduced to the simplest, most measurable terms. In the pursuit of clarity, fairness and definition, we have transmitted some unintended messages. Mastery learning. Goals and objectives. Student- oriented learning objectives. Behavioral objectives. We as teachers know what they all mean, and what good effects they should produce. But what do they say, indirectly, to the students? • Failure is never your fault. It’s due to bad teaching. • You can make up anything. If at first you don’t succeed — if at first you don’t try to succeed — take the test again, and again and again. There is always a second chance. • There’s no penalty for fouling up. There’s another quiz where that one came from; there may be more financial aid for another semester. We know . . . you're carrying 18 credits. We understand. Life is tough. You may have a week’s extension on the paper. • You’re not responsible for your actions. We know you have children and you have to work and you’re carrying 18 credits. We understand. Life is tough. You may have a week’s extension on the paper. The difficulty is that the basic philosophy of education is good. It sees students as whole people who have dimensions to their lives outside the classroom. It recognizes that not everyone can succeed the first time around or learn in exactly 15 weeks. It has forced teachers to examine what they do and make some badly needed changes. Mastery learning makes sense. You measure what people know rather than the hours they sit in lecture-hall seats. Goals and clearly stated objectives not only benefit students; they force teachers to define precisely what In an effort to present a diversity of viewpoints within its columns the Courier invites students, staff and the community to submit guest opinion pieces on college-related issues as well as on topics dealing with local, state and international affairs. Signed articles should be limited to 500 words. they want to accomplish and to make a rational link between what they say they want to do and what they in fact are doing. I can even find a few good words to say about behavioral objectives. When used properly, they can help a floundering student and also clarify the teacher’s thinking. Student-oriented learning objectives can relieve students’ anxieties and tell them exactly what they must learn. Despite the good intentions, those methods can also encourage irresponsibility and a lack of self-discipline among students. Students for the most part do not have to train themselves to produce on demand, think quickly, work efficiently, or deny today’s pleasure in favor of a greater payoff tomorrow. Their skills are weakened and their learning lessened because they take so little responsibility for learning. When I was in college, a professor of European history seared his image — and a lot of European history — on my memory by placing till responsibility for what I learned on my shoulders. A hundred of us filed into the lecture hall on the first day. After the initial formalities, he handed us a six-page, single-spaced bibliography. “Read what you think you ought to know to pass the course,” he said. It may have been an extreme measure, but for me and most of the others in that class it worked. We learned. he new methods have also bred student irresponsibility by sidetracking us. By putting so much emphasis on subject matter and skills, many educators seem to have lost sight of the fact that good teachers always have fostered learning in many directions — mastery of subject, intellectual skills, personal behavior, values. Idealistically, and perhaps naively, we believed in the past that we were preparing students not only for jobs but for their places in the larger world. In the liberal In a complex ... society that speeds through social change at a dizzying pace, one cannot blame education alone for the lack of emphasis on values. arts, we have justified our existence in a society intent on cost-effectiveness by claiming that we were educating the whole human being for Life, not merely training a brain for a skill. Those of us in history have liked the Jeffersonian model — we were producing responsible citizens for the well-being of the republic, for the greater social good. I still believe in all that — and I think most educators do. We just have concentrated so hard on stating clear objectives and providing a supportive, nonthreatening environment for students that we have de-emphasized values and personal behavior. It’s often too much trouble to write objectives for values. Are they objectives or goals? How do you put them in behavioral terms? What will the measurable outcome be? Better to forget it. In a complex, heterogeneous society that speeds through social change at a dizzying pace, one cannot blame education alone for the lack of emphasis on values. Increasingly, however, the literature on curriculum development calls - for finding ways to teach values once again, and to teach students to define and assess their own values. In recent years, the definition of values has become so political — involving race, sex, religion — that we seem to have forgotten that some values are just practical, common-sense attributes that pay off directly in our personal and professional lives. Responsibility toward our families, our employers and Don't Worry Mom, I Wasn't Quite Ready For It. ill Tata It Tuesday? our communities permits us to function as true adults with ultimately greater freedom. Self-discipline gives us a rein on personal wants and passions so that we can command a responsive body and mind. A mind that does what its owner tells it to do is a precious thing. Our students need such values. They will work at jobs in which their bosses cannot — or choose not to — define objectives and expectations for them. They will encounter some employers who demand the highest standards — and others who perform so shabbily that the employees’ only recourse for self-respect is in the standards they set for themselves. /know most students eventually learn some of all this. The marketplace, particularly in a depressed economy, teaches them. But why should they have to be fired twice to learn? We must go beyond the pedagogy of skills and quantitative objectives and once again profess our own values through our behavior and through our expectations for our students. We teach values when we refuse to tolerate procrastination, self-indulgence, laziness or lack of any sense of priorities. We can encourage students to make decisions about what is important to them, and we can give them the tools and guidelines to make those decisions. Without sacrificing the gains we have made through modern teaching strategies and without losing compassion, we must force students to practice self-discipline and to take responsibility for their own learning.

James J. Nyka Opinion The Courier/October 14, 1983 Russia: The enigmatic dichotomy By D. RANDALL OLSON • One of the finest recordings available today of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg’s exaltingly beautiful Peer Gynt suite was produced by the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra. • One of the most shockingly barbaric acts of this decade was the destruction by Soviet air defense forces of an unarmed Korean 747 civilian airliner, which had accidently overflown Russian airspace on Aug. 21. These two utterly diametrical facts illustrate most comprehensively the nature of the world’s other superpower. WHEN AT HER best, she is Mother Russia, land of fantasy, home to millions. She is Tchaikowsky and sugar plum fairies, cosmonauts and collectives. But at other times, Russia is the Soviet Union, paranoid, incompetent, diabolical. Russia is Stalin and Pravda, tanks and the KGB. Russia is the transcontinental Siberian railroad, hydroelectric dams and a leading producer in the world of oil and steel. But, apparently no less important, Russians claim to possess the best mud in the world. “The mud of the salt lakes near Odessa,’’ says an official guidebook, “which is considered to be unequaled in curative capacity, has long since been recognized as a world standard for mud.” WINSTON CHURCHILL, that preeminent states¬ man of profound insight, once admitted his complete bafflement regarding the Soviet state. “I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia,” Churchill said. “It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” In view of the recent Korean airliner atrocity, Churchill’s words seem as timely today as when they were uttered in 1939. Why the Soviets shot down a harmless airliner, refused to admit it, lied about it, then defended it and finally blamed the entire episode on the United States is nearly beyond common sense reasoning. MOST OBSERVERS NOW conclude that sheer military incompetence was to blame for the Soviets having to shoot down the Korean airliner. By the time Russian interceptors reached the plane, it was nearly out of Soviet airspace, leaving them few options for dealing with the situation. Destroying the plane was one of those options. One American air force officer commented (The Economist), “If this is the best they can do against a high-flying airliner, we should have no trouble in a war. A B-52 with all its decoys, jammers and other countermeasures could be over . Moscow before they figured out what was going on.” IN VIEW OF the facts, the Soviet Union is the perfect home for communism. Only the communal economic system can provide them the outlet they need for their bureaucratic inefficiency. For instance, a Soviet draperie factory was experiencing severe absenteeism, drunkeness on the job and overall low worker morale (Manchester Guardian). Investigating the situation, the authorities discovered that the plant had been producing low-grade curtains, but shoppers wanted high-grade drapes and refused to purchase this factory’s goods. Stores were returning by the truckload the products which the plant had produced. But production at the plant remained at peak levels, because planners had determined so many cubic yards of draperies should be sold. SINCE THE STORAGE areas of the plant were bursting to capacity, output was reduced, and worker production incentives were curtailed, resulting in the poor morale situation. This is but one minor problem in the economic maze which must be dealt with by the Communists every day. It is difficult to imagine the bureaucracy necessary to control an economy the size of that in the Soviet Union. Considering the effort required to solve the draperie debacle, how many planners, auditors, adjusters, trouble-shooters and coordinators are required to handle an entire economy producing cars, refrigerators, TVs, pots and pans, shoes, pants, jackets, beds, band-aids and cuticle remover? Why anyone would want to burden themselves with all that planning when the free-market does it all with no fuss is surely a \"riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” THE TROUBLE WITH all this is, of course, that this nation of intelligence and ignorance, of truth and lies, of talent and incompetence, is a bonafide superpower. The Soviet military machine is capable of obliterating civilization as we know it. And standing between the great Enigma and its world aims, which are born of materialistic Communist doctrine, is the United States. While the incompetence of the Communists may make us shake our heads in bewilderment, we must thoroughly understand that when it comes to controlling the economies of the world, these people mean business. Lenin was dead serious when he said that the Socialist countries would hang the capitalists with their own rope. Surely no American likes the idea of having to maintain an armed deterrent to counter what some regard as a non-existent Soviet threat. But the facts of history, and history as recent as Aug. 21, show that the Russian nation has not yet bridled its barbaric character. UNTIL SUCH TIME as the Soviet Union becomes civil, and gradually steers away from the fatally flawed theory of communism which dooms that nation to failure and frustration, the free world would do well to retreat from the temptation to compromise its guard against the system which has vowed to rule the world. The only way the socialists can get the rope with which to do their mischief is if free men of goodwill in their unwisdom give it to them. After all, they can’t very well do us in with draperies. D.

The Student Voice Should the college provide locker boxes where students could leave their books and personal belongings while inside the bookstore? Luisa Sorrentino, Lombard: “Yes, I think they should, because many students have a lot of books and it’s hard to carry them all, seeing how the school is so big.” Kristan Sorensen, Lombard: “Yes, because I have too much stuff to carry.” Mark Schmidt, Glen Ellyn: “Yeah, because there would be less confusion.” John LeFrenze, Clarendon Hills: “No, I think most people do not have the ambition or the opportunity to steal other students’ books.” Sue Cordina Sue Cordina, Carol Stream: “Yes, because people’s books get stolen. I heard on the first day of school about two girls having their books stolen. I don’t like going in without my books. When I come here, I usually share a regular locked locker with a friend.” Vicki Dali Vicki Dali, West Chicago: “Yes, the way it is now, it is too easy to rip stuff off.” Jack Irick, Villa Park: “Sure, why not? You won’t lose your stuff or people won’t take it or steal it.” Don Said, Glendale Heights: “Yes. I don’t like the idea of leaving my books there.” Mark Roegner, Brookfield: “Yes, I think they should because everybody steals and if you have to stand in line and everything, it’s just bad news. I already had two books stolen.” Jennifer Sheldon, Lombard: “No, the cubbie holes are fine for me because I don’t think anyone’s going to steal the books.” Mark Benson, LaGrange: “Yes, because books can get stolen.” Mark Gliva, Woodridge: “I think they should. I think they j need them for security. I’ve’, never heard anyone walking away with something, but it would be good to prevent loss.” Jean Auten, Downers/ Grove: “I think it would be, safer. I have never done this before. I’m a new student and I felt uncomfortable leaving unmarked books with so many people around.” Kevin Gilsdone, Warren- ville: “Yes! A couple of my friends have had their books stolen and I’m in constant fear that mine will be next.” Lynette Santra, Willow- brook: “Yes, but only for those who are going to be in the bookstore for some length of time. It can become tedious for those just going in for a few minutes. For these, the cubby holes will be fine.” Mercy Vance, Lombard: “Yes, so your belongings don’t get ripped off. It would be a lot safer!” Tom Cannata, Lombard: “Yes. I always thought about my stuff getting stolen if I just leave it there when I go in. If they provided locker boxes, nobody would have to worry about getting their expensive books ripped off.” Pam Heizmann, Lombard: “Yeah, it would help because you might get your stuff ripped off and you can never find your books.” Kelly Cieskiewicz Kelly Cieskiewicz: “I think it is a good idea. It will help organize people’s books. It’ll be more convenient, too.” Dave Wolski, Naperville: “Yes. It’s safer because things could get stolen.\" Sarah Mindick, Downers Grove: “Yes. It could be a good idea because it would be beneficial to the bookstore and students. No one could get ripped off.” Laura Fester, West Chica¬ go: “Yes, they have too many books to carry around and too many rip-offs.” Marybeth Quick, Villa Park: “Yes. The first time I went there, I was worried that my things would get stolen.” Greg Richard, Glen Ellyn: “Yes. People pick up others’ books by accident. That would solve the problem.” Carol Visdoni, Woodridge: “No, it would be a waste of funds.” Sandy Smidt, Blooming- dale: “I worry because you have to leave your things. Even if there’s a guard, he doesn’t know what belongs to whom.” Tim Zurow, Lombard: “Yeah, I don’t go in there much, just at the beginning of the quarter, but yeah, I guess they should have them.” Jerry Sei vert Jerry Seivert, Bolingbrook: “I think it’s a good idea to keep books outside the book¬ store. The lockers are a good idea. I haven’t personally had anything stolen but if it’s a problem, I think it should be stopped.” 6 News The Courier/October 14, 1983 Parabola project succeeds By NORA TIDD Charles Derer is an artist who thinks and works on a large scale. On Aug. 12 at the Fermilab in Batavia, he presented his “Parabola Project” — a light sculpture that lit up the night sky to a height five times that of the Sears Tower. Derer was CD’s artist in residence during the summer, and his class here at CD was titled “Constructivist Light Sculpture.” The seven students in the class assisted with the actual set-up of the project. The idea first took form as a series of rough pencil sketches calculating angles and elevations. An official map of the Fermilab grounds was used to determine the placement of 12 carbon arc lights, vintage WW II. A walk through the sight with a surveyor was then necessary to measure and place the lights and to insure the absence of unexpected obstacles. Three sets of final adjustments were made to perfect curves and distances. When 8:30 p.m. arrived, 15,000 people on the site watched the 12 lights with 800 million candle power each, turn on sequentially and rotate into final position. Derer had been concerned about natural obstructions, but had not anticipated the spectacular effect of shooting stars from a meteor shower interplaying with the sculpture. Several small planes took a fancy to the unique art form and soared in and out among the beams of light to create another variation of the theme. Derer, who holds a fine arts degree from Northern Illinois University with a major in industrial design, believes his artforms in various mediums are “industrially oriented.” He described his Parabola Project as a “big environmental sculpture” that is “alive and well but does not harm the environment.” Though Derer is moving forward with other projects now, such as his CD class in two-dimensional black and white, he muses upon the possibility of creating another light sculpture at some time in the future. _ Nutrition seminars A seminar on vegetarian meal planning, will meet from 7 to 9:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 27, at Hinsdale Junior High School.

The brutal murder frightened a lot of students, and saddened Wells’ friends, most of whom described him as a nice, unassuming, smart individual. Then came the results of the police investigation: Wells’ death was proba¬ bly connected to campus cocaine traffic. Boulder police have since begun a wider probe into student cocaine use at the bustling, mountainside campus. BOULDER IS SUPPOSED to be hip. Lincoln, Neb., isn’t. But earlier in September, University of Lincoln police arrested two students and seized an estimated $200,000 worth of coke. The incidents illustrate that cocaine dealing and its related violence are not only plaguing some campuses these days, but may slowly be filtering onto many other campuses as the “drug of the rich” becomes more readily available, and the price gap between it and marijuana narrows. While most campus law enforcement officers say that cocaine use still isn’t as widespread or troublesome as drinking or marijuana use, more are noticing its presence on campus, and its increasing acceptance by students. “There’s definitely a growing use of cocaine on college campuses,” says Gerardo Gonzalez, director of the Campus Drug Information Center at the University of Florida and president of Boost Alcohol Consciousness Con¬ cerning the Health of University Students, a national organization which helps students and administrators confront drug and alcohol problems on campus. “COKE HAS KIND of become the ‘in’ thing to do,” he notes. “And as the substance becomes more socially ac¬ ceptable, it gets more attention. As more people see it around, you also see a greater availability, and the cycle continues.” Boulder police are busting an average of 25 Colorado students a year for coke possession and sales, says Lt. Jim Fadenrecht, compared to two or three cocaine-related arrests a few years ago. “The majority of coke arrests are related to rock concerts on campus,” he says, and “a handful are made in dorms and student housing.” “Cocaine is becoming a more and more common problem on our campus,” agrees Lt. Joe Wehner of campus security at the University of Lincoln. “It is no longer unusual to find people selling coke on campus along with other illegal narcotics.” Even at schools where cocaine isn’t labeled a problem, law enforcement officials report that the drug is getting more noticeable. “ARREST-WISE, WE haven’t seen any big increase with cocaine,” says Crystal Limerick of the University of Virginia police. “But I feel it’s around, and I am constantly surprised that it’s not a bigger problem than it is.” At Rutgers University, “I would say we’ve seen a slight increase” in cocaine use, says campus detective John Janowiak. “I see it as a steady problem right now, but not yet an excessive one,” says John Carpenter, director of public safety at San Diego State University and president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforce¬ ment Administrators. While no specific data are available on coke use among college students, “my gut reaction is that the problem on campus is a reflection of the growing use of coke among the general Please turn to page 8 i [ y^tnna <S3. <3(arLns Michael A.

The main thrust of the article, however, was certainly clear. Prevalent in the thoughts of many persons today who were of college age back in the ’60s ponder their evolving values of the present and compare them to the creeds they emphatically held some 16 years ago. It was they who proposed to change the world through highly idealistic concepts while battling the “establishment” with the phrase, “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” NEEDLESS TO SAY, the originat¬ ors of the above slogan are in that post-30 age bracket now. And perhaps many of this group look upon their past with disquieting skepticism and realis¬ tic hindsight both. One person who belongs to the “baby boom” generation is filmmaker Law¬ rence Kasdan. His latest feature release, “The Big Chill,” is a study of how these adults remember their college careers with joyous nostalgia and cautious reflection. As one may know, Kasdan has been tremendously successful as a screen¬ writer, having been responsible for the scripts of the last two “Star Wars” pictures, “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and directing the provocative film, “Body Heat.” But \"The Big Chill” is quite different in style from those other movies; this film is directly aimed at the over-30 audience and at times gets bogged down in the cerebral feelings of its characters. EIGHT CENTRAL FIGURES are in this story, seven of whom attended college together at the University of Michigan. They have a reunion of sorts, during the funeral of a close friend. Alex was his name, and he committed CAST OF “THE Big Chill,” study of how adults from includes (l-r) JoBeth Williams, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Kay \"baby boom” generation remember their college Place, Tom Berenger, William Hurt, Meg Tilly, Glenn careers with joyous nostalgia and cautious reflection, Close and Kevin Kline. suicide by slashing his wrists. Through¬ out the movie, the group tries to sort out the reasons why Alex killed himself, while at the same time renewing old relationships at a spacious Italianate beach-house. The owners of the home are Harold (played by Kevin Kline) and Sarah (Glenn Close). Each has been successful after college, he as a running-shoe store owner and she as a doctor. They have become, without fully realizing it, part of the establishment they loathed earlier in their lives. Then there is Sam (Tom Berenger), a TV actor who plays in the pulp private detective series “J.T. Lancer” (a take-off, perhaps of the real television series, “T.J. Hooker”). He has been swept up in a tide of instant popularity, a fact that brings him problems. Sam complains of his divorce, the loss of his family life, and the distrust he has for everyone in Hollywood. He yearns for the old times. Jeff Goldblum portrays Michael, currently a staff writer for People magazine and the former radical editor of Michigan University’s college news¬ paper. Nowadays, he pens stories of celebrity worship and travels the country interviewing oddball personali¬ ties. He, too, wonders how he changed from a revolutionary to a conservative. OTHERS WHO ROUND out the cast are Mary Kay Place, a public defender turned high-priced lawyer, William Hurt, as a burned-out Vietnam vet, and JoBeth Williams as the wife of a successful businessman. This film would be better enjoyed if the viewer’s age was approximate with the characters on the screen.

Edward Albee’s Pulitzer Prize-win¬ ning play “Seascape” will be the first theater production of the quarter, running from Tuesday, Oct. 18 to Saturday, Oct. 22 in the Studio Theater in Building M at 8 p.m. Admission is free for students and senior citizens, $1 for the public. Directing the play will be Frank Tourangeau, whose previous directing experiences at CD include last year’s musical “Jesus Christ, Superstar” and this summer’s “Summer and Smoke.” Tourangeau says the seldom-pro¬ duced play is “one of Albee’s most eloquent works” and will provide “challenges in character interpretation and costuming” for his cast and crew. SET ON A beach, the four-character play begins with a middle-aged couple — Nancy and Charlie — reflecting on their differing philosophies of life. As they talk, however, a pair of lizard-like sea creatures named Sarah and Leslie emerge from the sea and the resulting action comes from interactions between the “innocents” from the sea and the more wordly, land-based humans. ‘‘Warm, absurd, serious, visually exciting” and “very entertaining” is how Tourangeau summarizes the work. Playing the sea creatures Sarah and Leslie will be Carol Black and Thomas Orland, while Paul Mapes will be cast as Charlie and former student Laura Lindsey will play Nancy. The produc¬ tion will feature costumes designed by Shari Fasel, and makeup by Michael Lanners. Sets will be designed by Richard Holgate. “SEASCAPE WILL BE CD’s first entry in the American College Theater Festival, a nationwide competition for dramatic productions at colleges and universities. The play will be seen during its run by local judges and, if chosen, will move on to regional and national competition. The musical “Chicago” will be the final play staged this fall and will run Nov. 10 through 13 and Nov. 17 through 20. Jack Weiseman, associate dean of humanities and liberal arts, will be the director with musical direction by Lee Kesselman. Performances will be in the Performing Arts Center, Building M, at 8 each evening except Sundays when starting time will be 2 p.m. Admission is $5 and proceeds will be used to benefit performing-arts programs at the college. CD’s music department, called “one of the most progressive, and innovative of any educational institution in the country” by CD orchestral music director Harold Bauer, will present several free concerts in coming months in the Performing Arts Center.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE on Drug Abuse claims that nearly 29 percent of the 18-to-25-year-old popula¬ tion has used coke, and cocaine use in general has doubled since 1975. But aside from the increasing social acceptance of coke, its growing presence on campuses may also be attributable to government crackdowns on marijuana, which have cut pot supplies and pushed up its street price. Indeed, at the University of Florida “an ounce of marijuana is going for as much as $100 or more,” says Gonzalez. With coke now selling for $100 a gram, he continues, the price of what was once called “rich man’s speed” is no longer considered that exorbitant. “In the past three years we’ve arrested more students involved in drug traffic than anytime I’ve been here,” says John Skaar of the University of Wisconsin police. Students frequently “get involved in dealing coke right before the semester starts” when they come to campus with saved-up money or with their student loan and grant money, he says. The students invest their savings on coke, and can triple their money within a term, Skaar notes. But Dennis Martin of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators says it’s rare. “SURE, THE TIME cocaine may be most noticeable is when students are coming back on campus,” he says, “but that doesn’t mean it has anything to do with loan and grant money.” However they finance it, many students who start using coke \"recrea- tionally,” Gonzalez says, “don’t really have the money to support continued use of the drug unless they start selling.” Consequently, a network begins to build among dealers and users, and the web spreads across a campus. The biggest danger “is the tremen¬ dous -amount of violence associated with the cocaine scene,” he contends. Indeed, Boulder police “have had armed robberies and people bring guns, threatening people, and pistol whipping them” over coke deals, says campus police Lt. Dave Evans. Nebraska police “have noticed an increase in theft and violence on campus along with the increase in coke and illegal drug use,” reports Wehner. “What we are seeing is a very mixed picture, and a situation where cocaine is slowly becoming less of a white, upper-middle class drug,” says Dan Keller, public safety director at the University of Louisville and head of a nationwide campus crime prevention association. A lot of campus law enforcement officials, he adds, “are holding their breath and wondering” if cocaine is making its first inroads at their schools.
