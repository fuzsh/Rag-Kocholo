After the completion of my Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) project on the crisis and editing the volume Greece in Crisis: The Cultural Politics of Austerity (I.B. Tauris, 2017), I decided that the time had come to attempt such an interdisciplinary project, using two watershed events in Greek history, the fall of the military junta and the economic crisis, to bookend it. Analysing and mapping out cultural undercurrents has to be done in relation to an extensive time span and this accounts for the long period covered by this study. Obviously, the book does not aspire to offer comprehensive coverage of developments in Greece after 1974 but simply aims to explore certain important areas, deploying a cultural perspective and using three key concepts as connecting threads in the analysis: modernization, transition and diversity. The number of articles published in English on the crisis, as well as on post-junta Greece, over the last decade has been unprecedented and the time has come for a broader study, which can synthesize research findings, critically reflect on the accumulated material and appeal to academic and non-specialist audiences alike. The book’s range may seem ambitious, but hopefully it will provide a sound basis for more extensive studies in the future. This project was made possible, thanks to a two-year Leverhulme Research Fellowship (2018–20), for which I am most grateful to the Leverhulme Trust. I have had the opportunity to present material from this book in lectures at the Universities of Munich and Cambridge and in papers at conferences in Athens, Thessaloniki and the University of Crete. An earlier version of the first chapter has been published in the journal Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies (vol. 41, no. 2, 2017) and a shorter version of the last chapter in the book Political and Cultural Aspects of Greek Exoticism, edited by Panayis Panagiotopoulos and Dimitris P. Sotiropoulos (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020).

September 2020\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom junta to crisis The period following the fall of the military junta in 1974 could be seen as a time of consolidating and celebrating democracy and has been described as the ‘Swiss phase’ of Greek history. Known as the Metapolitefsi (meaning regime change), referring both to the transition from dictatorship to democracy and to the ensuing period (but with no agreement as to its duration), it changed the political landscape of Greece and led to the country’s longest period of peace and prosperity.1 It also contributed to the reconciliation of warring factions in Greek society with the legalization of the Communist Party (KKE) and the return of political refugees and paved the way to consensus on the abolition of the monarchy (1974), the language question (1976) and membership of the European club (1981). A period of high expectations, dynamism and mobility was inaugurated and Greece gradually developed into a tolerant society. The restoration of democracy challenged the post-Civil War ideological status quo by replacing anti-communism with anti-fascism as the country’s foundational myth, the nation (ethnos) with the people (laos), ethnikofrosyni (patriotism) with ellenikotita/romiosyni (Greekness) and the promotion of democratic values. Though the Metapolitefsi is seen primarily as a political event or turning point, we do not need yet another book about its politics. The emphasis on the political developments has obscured the cultural dynamics of the period and therefore the main aim of this book is to explore the pivotal role of culture in shaping the post-junta era. If the Metapolitefsi can be described in political terms as an age of democratization and reconciliation, in cultural terms it might be defined as the age of identities, since its main preoccupations, as discussed During the 1970s and 1980s the word ‘Metapolitefsi’ was used to refer primarily to the regime change in 1974, but since 1989 its meaning has been expanded to cover a wider period (Kallivretakis 2017: 215). Some people also refer to the post-junta period as the ‘Third Hellenic Republic’.\n\n1\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\n2\n\nin this study (Europeanization, contested pasts, religion, migration, language and gender), converge from different pathways on the notion of identity as a common denominator. And this backs up the claim that culture has always been ahead of political or institutional initiatives in rehabilitating or promoting the other, the marginal or the neglected in various cultural discourses and art forms. How then should we define or periodize the Metapolitefsi? When does it end? And is it a useful term? These questions have been discussed for years and, while the term itself is still shrouded in vagueness, there are definitely two main approaches to the Metapolitefsi: the politico-historical one, which tends to focus on outlining its various phases or speculating about its end, and the evaluative, which is retrospective and totalizing in assessing the period as a whole. In his book Greece of Metapolitefsi 1974–2009, Yannis Voulgaris divides this period into two phases: 1974–89 (Greece of Metapolitefsi) and 1990–2009 (Greece of globalization) (2013: 13).2 This periodization may appear confusing because the term Metapolitefsi is used for both a shorter and a longer period, yet it reflects the widespread uncertainty about its death throes. As with the postwar period, most historians tend to delimit the beginning but not the end of the era. And punning statements such as ‘let’s put an end to the Metapolitefsi’ show an eagerness for closure. It is worth noting that similar pronouncements have been made ever since the mid-1980s. Later on historians were keen to place the end firmly in 1989, which they justified by citing the rise of individualism and the receding of the political as a social ideal (Voglis 2011), while others saw the start of the economic crisis as decisively marking its end (Pappas 2014) and the threshold to the twenty-first century (Liakos 2014: 13–14). The Metapolitefsi might be seen as a break with the past or a new era, yet what is celebrated on 24 July every year is not a new beginning but a kind of continuity: the restoration of democracy after the hiatus of the dictatorship and the return to power of politicians from the 1960s. The nostalgia for earlier, better times or the fantasy of the restoration of an elusive prosperity can also be detected in some discussions about the crisis. Though there was even talk of a ‘second Metapolitefsi’ (Pretenderis 1996) and the qualifier ‘perpetual’(αέναη) has occasionally been attached to the term, signalling a constant desire for a Christoforos Vernardakis has offered another periodization by referring to an early period (1974– 81), an intermediate (1981–96) and a late Metapolitefsi (1996–2010) (2011: xxi). N. C. Alivizatos (2015) singles out two forward-looking and creative periods of the Metapolitefsi (1974–7 and 1996– 2000) describing the other periods as static or even retrogressive. Membership of the eurozone (1 January 2002) has also been seen as another turning point in the history of the Metapolitefsi, while the two referenda of December 1974 (on the restoration/abolition of the monarchy) and July 2015 have been suggested as possible markers in the period (Avgeridis, Gazi and Kornetis 2015: 16).\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nsymbolic new beginning, the crisis seems to have provided a definite end point for the Metapolitefsi. Yet it could be argued that a period reaches its end when we start reflecting back on it or speculating about its end. In this case, however, the period of reflection was rather lengthy, pointing to a longue durée or, for some, to an endless hangover. On the one hand the Metapolitefsi has been praised as a period of prosperity, democratization, peace and improved access to health and education, while on the other it has been criticized for clientelism, failed modernization, state expansion, corruption and political violence (Kalyvas 2016: 56, 60). The crisis strengthened this dual perception of the post-1974 period both as success and failure, progress and regression. Though critical assessments can be found earlier, with the 1980s being described as either a wasted or a populist decade (Clogg 1993; cf. Vamvakas and Panagiotopoulos 2014), the crisis has fostered a rereading and retrospective criticism of the post-dictatorship transition to democracy (Zestanakis 2016). It has prompted many commentators, for instance, to regard the recent difficulties as the result of the earlier failures and ‘populism as the most important chapter in the autobiography of Greece’s Metapolitefsi’ (Pappas 2014: 8–9). The country’s post-1974 history has been turned into an interpretative framework and has often been blamed for the troubled present and the uncertain future (Liakos and Kouki 2015: 53). According to the critical approach espoused in different ways by both the Right and the Left, the Metapolitefsi saw the rise of an agonistic mentality, particularly in the eyes of those who had been persecuted and marginalized in the aftermath of the Civil War. For the Left, the emergent anti-authoritarian culture was critical of institutions such as the Church, which were supportive of the post-Civil War status quo and the junta.3 Such criticism has even been extended to more recent practices implied by the slogan ‘The junta did not end in 1973’, used as late as June 2013, when the government shut down the public broadcasting organization (ERT). From a right-wing perspective, the agonistic mentality cultivated a counterculture of disobedience and suspicion towards any form of political consensus, culminating in the events of December 2008 and the perception of the crisis as a form of colonization. Interestingly, Greece has had one of the most persistent problems with political violence in Europe and this has been a continuing aggravation in various manifestations since the 1970s (Kassimeris 2001 and 2013). It could be said, however, that the critical reception According to the historian Antonis Liakos, the Church is the only institution not to have been touched by the Metapolitefsi (‘Ο Δεσπότης και η πλύστρα’, To Vima, 20 March 2005).\n\n3\n\n4\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nof the post-junta period was not so much directed at its politics as its so-called ‘culture’, inviting us to take a cultural approach to the period. Though the economic crisis had begun earlier, May 2010, the date of the first bailout agreement between the Greek government and the EU/IMF, has been treated as the starting point of the period of impoverishment and loss of sovereignty that saw Greece lose a quarter of its GDP.4 The qualifier ‘economic’ (or ‘debt’) was quite quickly dropped, indicating that the crisis was a wider phenomenon than a purely financial one, which had inaugurated a period of post-democracy with decisions being taken by technocrats or unelected bodies outside the country, undermining the democratic processes. A discourse of Greek exceptionalism was also encouraged by the crisis, presenting Greece as a ‘sinful’ country not comparable to other EU members.5 What characterized the Greek crisis was not just its intensity but also its duration for political and economic reasons related to the lack of consensus among politicians compared to the other countries in crisis (e.g. Portugal, Cyprus) or involving Greece’s inability to devalue its currency and thus reduce the debt. Because of its financial difficulties, Greece secured the largest ever support package offered to a nation state, yet the crisis led to new social and ideological divisions and has radically altered the way of life of many Greeks.6 For some it brought back the ghost of the Civil War and divided Greeks once again (with references to Germanotsoliades and tagmatasfalites),7 while for others it made them more critical of the elites and the political parties.\n\nIn October 2009 the newly elected socialist government admitted that Greece was running an unsustainably high budget deficit and public debt. 5 Klaus Regling, ESM Managing Director, in a speech in Munich on 16 February 2017 stated, ‘Greece is a special case. Nowhere the extent of the problems was as large as in Greece, and the administration as weak’ https://www.esm.europa.eu/speeches-and-presentations/next-steps-makeeuro-area-more-resilient. On 3 August 2018 the Washington Post reported that ‘Greece has been one of the biggest economic failures you’ll ever see short of a war or revolution … there are only four countries that have grown less – or, more accurately, shrunk more – than Greece has in the past 10 years: Libya, Yemen, Venezuela and Equatorial Guinea’ (Matt O’Brien, ‘Only four economies have shrunk more than Greece’s in the past 10 years. Two of them have been hit by civil wars’, https://www. washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/03/only-four-economies-have-shrunk-more-than-greeceslast-years-two-them-have-been-hit-by-civil-wars/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.286d50556909). 6 The demographic impact of the crisis is enormous with the population of Greece shrinking and expected to decline even further in the coming years. The number of births between 2009 and 2017 went down by 29,380, a rate similar to the 1940s. See http://www.sev.org.gr/vivliothikitekmiriosi/evdomadiaio-deltio-gia-tin-elliniki-oikonomia/sos-o-plithysmos-tis-choras-meionetaikai-gernaei-6-dekemvriou-2018/. The reduction in kiosks in Athens also shows the extent of the crisis. In 2011 there were 931 kiosks and in seven years (2018) these were reduced to 600, while the Municipality of Athens decided to remove 323 deserted kiosks. On the other hand, the number of pawnshops shot up during the crisis from 81 in 2010 to 274 in 2012. 7 Meaning the Greek collaborationist security battalions formed by the puppet government of Ioannis Rallis during the Axis Occupation of Greece in order to support the German troops. 4\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nThe Greek word ‘κρίση’ is indeed an elusive signifier with a number of possible referents, denoting also ‘choice’, ‘judgement’ and ‘decision’. Crisis and critique are cognates in Greek, as Reinhart Koselleck (1988) reminds us. The word crisis can refer to an event (e.g. the Suez crisis) or a condition, whether permanent or temporary (e.g. institutions in crisis). For many it is never a descriptive designation but a framework that privileges and legitimizes narratives and interpretations. Are we constantly in a state of crisis? Have crises replaced the historical questions of the past (e.g. the Eastern Question) in the sociopolitical discourse? How is a crisis diagnosed and by whom? Who is articulating claims to crisis? Crisis compared to what? Can a crisis act as an explanatory trope or is it just a state of affairs? Does a crisis produce a tendency to retrospection, a sort of nostalgia for the happy days of the past or a forward-looking desire for reform or the politics of possibility? Is the crisis just a narrative device (Roitman 2013), an ‘iterative periodic concept’ or a ‘concept of futurity’ (Koselleck 2006)? Are crises inherent in the capitalist process (Harvey 2010)? Can we narrate a future without crisis? These are some of the general questions which can apply to different kinds of crises, including the recent Greek crisis. The phrase a ‘nation in crisis’ may have been used to describe Greece in the 1940s (Iatrides 1981), indicating that the country had experienced crises before in its history, yet the big issue in the recent crisis has been whether it could be seen as just an economic phenomenon and, thus, part of the global economic meltdown of 2008 or whether it was a more localized phenomenon with traceable historical and cultural roots.8 Though the economy tended to be the primary focus during the crisis, those who argued that the crisis was primarily social and cultural and tried to trace its origins in the past saw it more from a sociocultural perspective. As opposed to the structural and globalist interpretation of the Greek crisis, the culturalist approach, according to some analysts on the Left, moralizes austerity as a primarily transformative or disciplinary programme and shifts the focus onto culture as the deeper root of the problem (Mylonas 2014). The culturalization of politics involves explaining political developments according to a narrative that locates the roots of the crisis in inherent ‘cultural flaws’ and downplays the structural problems of the eurozone. Therefore, the structural/globalist and the culturalist approach came into conflict, and this might be one of the reasons that the Greek crisis Panayiotis Ioakimidis claimed that the crisis was ‘made in Greece’ and was primarily cultural (2011: 21) while Mitsopoulos and Pelagidis argued ‘that the causes of this crisis were deeply rooted in the way the country had been run during the last thirty years’ (2012: 211). See also Marangudakis (2019: xiv) and Danopoulos (2014).\n\n8\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\n6\n\nattracted such unprecedented international interest (Tziovas 2017). There is also an ethical and spiritual framing of the crisis as a trial or even a God-given ‘instructive’ punishment, accompanied by an understanding of austerity as an opportunity for salvation.9 Just as the fall of the junta encouraged a re-examination of the post-Civil War period, the recent economic crisis has prompted a rethink of the Metapolitefsi, triggering self-reflection and prompting a revisiting of political and cultural trends in Greece since 1974. The country’s post-war struggle focused on overcoming poverty and rebuilding the economy after the devastation of the 1940s, thus leading to the expansion of the middle class, increased social mobility and rapid improvements in living standards during the 1960s and early 1970s. This brought about a shift from economic to cultural concerns and a postjunta preoccupation with questions of identity and memory in an attempt to come to terms with otherness and diversity. Without adopting a deterministic culturalist explanation, this study revisits a range of cultural developments in order to present a more nuanced picture of the period from junta to crisis. But first it is useful to review the analytical paradigms of the Metapolitefsi and see how we can move beyond them.\n\nBeyond the dependency and modernization paradigms Dependency, (under)development and modernization were key concepts in the Metapolitefsi with the ‘dependency’ of the late 1970s and early 1980s and ‘modernization’ (a term loaded with meaning but often lacking in definition) from the mid-1980s onwards being the two dominant theories for explaining Greece’s position in the world. The former involved either the Cold War dynamics and its political divisions, assigning Greece nominally to the West, or the neo-Marxist ‘dependency narrative’, placing Greece in the Third World or the capitalist periphery (echoing the theories of the American economists Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy and their book Monopoly Capital (1966)). This approach relied mainly on political oppositions and economic considerations without explaining either why Greece was prone to more economic crises than According to some religious fundamentalists, the crisis has to do with the adoption of a secular way of life marked by individualism and materialism. This reading of the crisis as a kind of theodicy, requiring a move away from Western-style consumption and corruption to ascesis and endurance, shifts the emphasis from the external economic conditions to the transformation of the self and the restoration of Orthodox values (Kessareas 2018).\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nother Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) or EU partners or why it developed a decent parliamentary system at an early stage, joined exclusive Western clubs (OECD, NATO and EU) and was among the top forty countries in terms of its per capita income. Earlier contributions to the modernization debate by Marxist sociologists adopted the dependency approach and focused primarily on the role of the state. In a paper on tradition and modernization, Konstantinos Tsoukalas points out that ‘the “difference” between peripheral and central societies is usually experienced as “lack”, “distortion” or “weakness” ’ (1983: 40). He also added that peripheral societies develop ‘forms of articulation between society and state’ completely different to Western European models. In his view, in Greece the state has not functioned according to Weberian criteria of rational bureaucracy and this constitutes the particularity of the Greek case in contrast to the ‘West’. His approach was informed by the neo-Marxist dependency theory, as the title of his study Dependency and Reproduction: The social role of educational mechanisms in Greece (1830–1922) and the following passage from its introduction suggest: ‘The dependence of Greek society on the forces of the capitalist centre has determined its political, social and economic development for one and a half centuries’ (1977: 15). Another leading sociologist, Nicos Mouzelis, used the notions of ‘clientelism’, ‘patronage’ and ‘underdevelopment’ to demonstrate that Greece ‘deviated’ from the paradigm of the capitalist Western societies. For him the state is a ‘shapeless monster’, unwilling and unable to react to a rapidly changing international environment, while its rigid, over-politicized and particularistic orientations ‘have made it act in ways that merely consolidate Greece’s semi-peripheral/peripheral status within the world economy and also within the European Union’ (1996: 222). In reviewing different theories of modernization and their relevance to Greece, Mouzelis considers them unacceptably Eurocentric, but he still argues for some sort of ‘catching up’ in terms of democratization. The way for Greece to maintain its national identity within Europe is neither by turning its back on the values of Western Enlightenment nor, on the other hand, by imitating in a servile manner the commercialized syncretism of the global, postmodern culture. Instead, the way for Greece to maintain its national identity within Europe is to pursue a type of integration where ‘catching up with the West’ refers less to mindless consumerism and more to deep democratization – i.e., to the spread of rights from the top to the bottom of the social pyramid. (1996: 226)\n\n8\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nThough he sees the development of Greece not as ‘a question of imitating or catching up with the West’ (1978: 153), he still promotes Western Enlightenment as opposed to the anti-Europeanism and fanatical obscurantism of the Orthodox Church, considering the former’s achievements as ‘basic prerequisites for the maintenance and revival of Greece’s cultural heritage and national identity’ (1996: 227). Tsoukalas’s and Mouzelis’s approaches to modernization are informed, as I said, by the neo-Marxist theory of the dependency of the (semi-)periphery on the capitalist centre (Voulgaris 2019). From another Marxist perspective of the 1970s, Costis Moskov pointed to the dependency of the Greek state on the West and particularly the inadequate appropriation of its liberal ideology by the Greek bourgeois compradors. Though the ‘popular Orthodox tradition’ was in decline during the first decades of the new Greek state (1830–1909), he highlighted its potential for liberating Greeks from the capitalist West and forming an alliance with communism, provided that the latter relinquished its economic positivism. By combining Orthodoxy and Marxism, Moskov tried to outline a different pathway for overcoming Western dominance and securing the Greek state’s autonomy (Moskov 1972/4 and 1980). Later approaches equated modernization with Europeanization, focusing on institutional, legal or social policy reform and following EU guidelines. Their focus was not so much on Greece’s economic dependency as on catching up with Europe. Modernization, coupled with Europeanization and rationalization, became the mantra of Costas Simitis’s period of office (1996–2004) and for his followers (Economides 2017). As a one-way process, it involved equating the West with modernity and the efforts of a state with inadequate institutional infrastructure to catch up with the Western model. Being evolutionary, teleological and referring to a number of processes such as industrialization, secularization and democratization, modernization represented an invitation to internalize the need to strive to catch up and invited Greeks to measure themselves against European models or work towards achieving European standards and in turn shed any traces of belatedness or underdevelopment. Assessing Greece’s place in comparison to the ‘advanced’, ‘modernized’ countries of the West, as well as where it should be and how it was to get there, were questions deemed crucial and pressing for most of the intellectuals of the Metapolitefsi. Practices such as locating Greece in the capitalist periphery or judging its performance by European standards were accompanied by debates on cultural dualism. Greece was seen as constantly caught between tradition and modernity,\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nEast and West, Orthodoxy and Enlightenment, Byzantium/the Romeic and Antiquity/the Hellenic and the reformist and the underdog culture. One of the best sellers of the Metapolitefsi was a short book by Nikos Dimou, On the Unhappiness of Being Greek (1975), which was first published soon after the fall of junta and has since then gone through a number of editions (thirty-eight so far) and been translated into English. An excerpt from the postscript to the 2013 edition demonstrates the resilience of the dualist perception of the Greek torn between opposing forces: ‘He is divided between his glorious past and his meagre present, between his Eastern mentality and his European aspirations – torn asunder by forces of tradition (like the Orthodox Church) and modernity. His is a difficult fate’ (2013: 41). The tyranny of dualism seems to trap Greeks into two incompatible identity roles: as both Western, responsible and disciplined individuals (an image on display during the first Covid-19 lockdown) and as members of a caring, traditional community, marked by cultural intimacy and family values. Modernization in politics and economics and dualism in the area of culture emerged as the dominant analytical paradigms of post-junta Greece. While in the domain of social and economic policy or institutional reform modernization was driven by the Europeanization agenda, discussions about the cultural orientation and identity of the country were more ambivalent and open-ended. The main challenge Greece faced during the Metapolitefsi was to demonstrate that the country was able to complete the project of modernization, which, in turn, would have tipped the balance in the sphere of dualist oppositions by overcoming divisions and dissent and achieving some sort of synthesis or consensus. Following the crisis this still seems to be desirable for some and open to debate for others. Relying on a comparison with the ‘developed’ world and an idealized picture of the ‘West’ (often taken as an undifferentiated entity), modernization points to a series of deviations or absences in Greek society (e.g. a middle class (Kondylis 1991/2011), civil society (Mouzelis 1978 and 1996) and individualization (Ramfos 2000)), while the narrative of modernization highlighted underdeveloped projects or frustrated reforms (e.g. education (Dimaras 1973 and 1974)). Intellectual historians asked, ‘Why did the Enlightenment not lead to the development of a liberal political culture in Greece?’ (Kitromilides 1996a and 2013) and economic historians enquired, ‘Why was there no heavy industry in Greece?’ or noted the absence of a large Greek working class comparable to those in Western European countries.10 The 10\n\nIn the preface (omitted in the second, 2016, edition) of the first edition of his book Modern Greece (2001: xiii), Thomas Gallant expresses his scepticism about the term but he still uses it: ‘I am\n\n10\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\ncountry has been judged according to a Western model and has been found lacking or simply divergent, as the following quotation from a recent article by the anthropologist Renée Hirschon suggests: ‘What I call a “pre-modern” approach (or a “non-Western” one) to issues of time-management continues to prevail in Greece, because Greece did not follow the path of industrialization of the developed countries of the EU’ (2014: 156). By adopting a comparative or dualist approach, the modernization theory treats Greece as a story of inadequacy or belatedness.11 Belated compared to other Europeans and inferior in respect to their ancient ancestors, Greeks have always been measured and found wanting. In his book Belated Modernity and Aesthetic Culture, Gregory Jusdanis put forward the view that modernization in Greece had been judged ‘imperfect’ on the assumption that in non-western societies belated modernization ‘remains “incomplete” not because it deviates from the supposedly correct path but because it cannot culminate in a faithful duplication of western prototypes’ (1991: xiii). Peripheral societies internalize the incongruity between Western originals and local realities as a structural deficiency. Therefore, the lack of modernity is seen as a flaw, which, according to Jusdanis, ‘lies not in modernity’s absence but in its purposeful introduction, ignoring autochthonous exigencies’ (1991: xiii). Modernization theories based on the pattern of the Western model and its inadequate reproduction have been supported by the Western idealization of Classical Greece, which also presupposes the comparative difference between the latter and the present day as well as the Western discontent with the modern country (Gourgouris 1996: 73). This could range from disappointment, a falling short of Greece’s reputation in the Western imaginary, to the consideration of the country as inadequately modern or institutionally inefficient, an image reinforced by the recent crisis. The conflicting symbiosis of these two discourses among Westerners, and even Greeks themselves, became more visible as a result of the challenges of EEC/EU membership and received additional impetus during the crisis. Notions of underdevelopment, belatedness or insufficient\n\n11\n\naware that modernization is a loaded term and that in its most robust form modernization theory has come in for considerable criticism, much of which I accept. However, I would suggest that modernization theory may still provide us with a useful heuristic device for categorization or a yardstick against which we can measure developments in any specific culture. In other words, if we accept for the sake of argument that certain features of the developed western world may be labeled as “modern”, then we can employ for the sake of argument the term “modernization” as a form of shorthand abbreviation for a comparison of those specified features found in the developed world and elsewhere. I employ the term in this limited sense.’ The themes of ‘failure’, ‘lack’ and ‘inadequacy’ characterize the speaking subject of ‘Indian’ history (Chakrabarty 2000: 34). On modernization in the Balkans see Daskalov (1997).\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nmodernity formed a negative and pre-modern picture of Greece. Things become further complicated by the fact that Greeks themselves might either be complicit in this blaming and self-orientalizing process or strenuously resist it by harking back to the glory of the Classical era or displaying national pride. Greeks appear to have internalized their presumed inferiority to ‘Europeans’, while at the same time trying to deny it using the cultural capital of antiquity, thus facing the predicament of a postcolonial subject looking for signs of rejection as much as signs of affirmation. Culture has enabled elites in postcolonial and belated societies to understand and try to overcome their ‘backwardness’ and has therefore figured prominently in modernization projects. Even in a recent study it has been claimed that ‘in the case of peripheral capitalist societies, like Greece, for instance, tradition and modernity emerge as conflictual trends in an antagonistic relationship’ (Triandafyllidou et al. 2013: 12). Such statements confirm that up to now the narratives about Greece have been dominated by binarisms (West–East, modernity–traditionalism, modernization–populism), informed by political developments and promoting Westernizing and modernizing trends. All this suggests that the discussion of modernization in Greece has pointed to different forms of engagement with Europe: socio-economic (dependency theory), political-institutional (Europeanization) or cultural (dualisms). Departing from this approach, my study aspires to produce a more complex and hybrid narrative by focusing on the area of culture and self-understanding. The changing patterns of migration and attitudes to the past, the roller coaster of Euroscepticism, the rehabilitation of those defeated in the Civil War (1946– 9), the rediscovery of the Balkans following the end of the Cold War, the proliferation of audiences, canons and pasts, the growth of social movements, the rise of otherness and increased linguistic diversity add up to a more diverse society, whose development has to be seen as more complex. As a result, the dominant paradigm of modernization has begun to be questioned, while the practice of equating Europe with modernity began to break down, particularly during the crisis, when the discourse of ‘normalization’ (expressed by the slogan ‘Greece should become a normal country’) seems to have run parallel with that of modernization. Despite its revitalization in the 1990s in the form of the democratization of the countries of Eastern Europe, modernization has been challenged for being a neo-colonial strategy to force ‘others’ onto an inescapable and not culturally specific track towards development. The critique of teleological modernization theories led to the concepts of ‘multiple modernities’\n\n12\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\n(Eisenstadt 2000 and 2003), varieties of modernity (Schmidt 2006) or the ambivalences of modernity (Bauman 1991). Furthermore, the concept of reflexive modernization was introduced by Ulrich Beck in connection with the notion of ‘second modernity’ and the emergence of the so-called ‘risk society’ with its increasing reflexivity or self-criticism (Beck, Giddens and Lash 1994). The concept of reflexive modernization takes into account the contradictions and consequences of modernizing developments and is concerned with re-evaluating existing resources rather than increasing them (Mergel 2012). Modernity, as a sociopolitical concept, has not vanished, but it is becoming increasingly problematic (Beck, Bonss and Lau 2003: 2). Postcolonial studies also rejected the normative pattern of modernization modelled on the European example and defended the autochthonous intellectual traditions of non-Western societies (Chakrabatry 2000). Working with concepts such as ‘glocalization’ or ‘hybridization’ to introduce variety and a dynamic perspective into the analysis of the contemporary world, it scrutinized the evolutionary premise of modernity, thus encouraging a move from a normative notion of modernization to perceiving it as a heterogeneous, hybrid and self-reflexive process. Modernization might be defined and measured in institutional terms as convergence with Western models; from a cultural perspective it can be seen as a period of enhanced pluralism and diversity, involving resistances and setbacks, which in turn foster further differentiation from any presumed models. Modernization theories tend to underrate existing cultural differences, whereas ‘multiple modernities’ or ‘varieties of modernity’ emphasize them. The multiple modernities theory has been applied to the countries of East Asia (Japan and Singapore) or Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism and promotes the idea of varieties of modernity in the same way as we talk about varieties of capitalism. Multiple modernities are attentive to differences and modernization seems to be ‘more of a multidimensional process than was traditionally assumed’ (Allardt 2005: 498). On the basis that all contemporary societies are modern, only differently modern, it might be useful to look at political, institutional and cultural development in Greece from this perspective and the multitude of ways in which modernity expresses itself. Hitherto the models used to analyse Greek society have been permeated by theories of dependency, belatedness or absence, but gradually a shift is taking place from a comparative juxtaposition of Greece with Europe, using Western modernity as a yardstick, to a comparative consideration of Greece in postcolonial, orientalist or anti-Western terms. This has involved either\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nexploring its semi- or crypto-colonial status and its role in the orientalist imaginative process or focusing on the world of the East/Byzantium/ Orthodoxy to try and articulate Greece’s cultural difference vis-à-vis the West. The efforts at EU level to establish a common cultural ‘European identity’, the end of the Cold War, which had encouraged the age-old lumping together of ‘Eastern’, ‘Balkan’, ‘Byzantine’ and ‘Greek’, and the perception of Orthodoxy as a hindrance to modernization heightened the focus on religion and identity. The questioning of the idea of ‘Europe’ as coextensive with modernity and as a symbol of cultural superiority pointed up the in-betweenness of the Balkans as a manifestation of an intra-European Orientalism and the role of Orthodoxy in the new international reality. In a period in which Europeanization and modernization were being promoted, new critical positions towards the West emerged, originating from different intellectual perspectives and challenging Eurocentric theories of adjustment. They marked the transition from conformity with European modernization to the acceptance of notions of cultural difference and otherness. The theory, which in a way prepared this transition and facilitated the shift of emphasis from politics to culture, is that of cultural dualism, which had been a popular analytical tool since the 1980s and which is critically discussed in Chapter 1. As long as the project of modernization was thought to be incomplete (though the recent book by Yannis Voulgaris (2019) challenges this perception), the dualist dilemmas were perpetuated and the tensions between Westernized trends and pre-modern practices remained unresolved, leading to an increasing preoccupation with Greekness. Following the growing discussion about Europeanization or modernization and the proliferation of debates on Greek identity, a new space opened up in which culture started to operate alongside and even compete with politics and economics, in an attempt to give answers to some pressing questions. By analysing changing trends and problematizing the notion of modernization, this study aims to highlight the growing diversity and ambivalence of Greek society in the period between the fall of the junta and the economic crisis.\n\nFrom politics to culture The pluralism and prosperity Greece enjoyed after the fall of junta together with the fast pace of changing lifestyles and international developments (EEC/EU membership, collapse of communist regimes and the changing map\n\n14\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nof the Balkans) shifted attention from politics to issues of culture and history and from political amnesia to the recollection of marginalized historical subjects. Political conflicts subsided and were transferred to the domain of culture: debates and controversies about identities, religion, gender or minorities and disputes about history, heritage or literary canons. The story of the Metapolitefsi could be seen as a challenge to cultural homogenization and a growing movement towards diversity. In other words, a transition occurred from a traditional and hierarchical power structure to a more pluralistic method of governance, involving various institutions, independent monitoring authorities, consultations, digital networks and generally a shift from a centripetal to a centrifugal trend. At the same time there was a growing sense of insecurity and cultural defensiveness due to Europeanization and globalization. The paradoxical coexistence of pluralism and diversity on the one hand and insecurity and protectionism on the other increased the debates on identity and the fetishization of Greekness, in an attempt to resolve cultural dilemmas or navigate between opposing perspectives on the past. One of the hallmarks of the Metapolitefsi involves the subtle transition from a struggle for political power to a contest for cultural hegemony and the gradual disentanglement of cultural identities from political affiliations. This transition has entailed a process of self-examination and reflection on the cultural dynamics of the period. Adopting a cultural perspective when looking at social changes may offer new ways of charting those changes as well as alternative paradigms by revisiting dominant models of analysis. It has been claimed that by the 1990s, the notion of ‘society’ – as it had been practiced by social historians in the twentieth century and particularly after 1945 – was swept away by the interpretative onslaught of memory and cultural studies. The notion of society, broadly speaking again, was based on a linear concept of history developing forward along one temporal timeline, and privileging social and economic topics interpreted in terms of their function and structure. The notion of ‘culture’, in contrast, is based on a multi-temporal concept of history where past and present commingle and coalesce, capturing simultaneously different and opposing narratives, and privileging topics of representation and memory interpreted in terms of experience, negotiation, agency, and shifting relationships. (Confino 2011: 38–9)\n\nThis emphasis on culture, being understood as both an explanation and something requiring explanation, can be seen even in the later work of Marxist intellectuals\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nconcerned with the ‘cultural turn’ (Jameson 1998) or who write books on culture (Eagleton 2000). The primacy of the political and economic gives way to the cultural and this necessitates a shift from collective self-definitions to personal lifestyles. Traditionally, according to Terry Eagleton, culture ‘was a way in which we could sink our petty particularisms in some more capacious, all-inclusive medium … [and] now means the affirmation of a specific identity – national, sexual, ethnic, regional – rather than the transcendence of it’ (2000: 38). Yet, culture as identity or differentiation is a continuation of politics by other means. Focusing on human rights and gender, minorities and identities, biopolitics and ecology, the new cultural politics have re-accentuated the old polarities between Right and Left along these lines. The emphasis on diversity and identity politics was also fostered by the growth of the ‘cultural Left’ after the fall of the junta, which together with the ‘social Left’ promoted new social movements, human rights and tolerance of otherness. In this respect, the role of the Greek universities was instrumental. Their number increased exponentially after the junta and they evolved into vibrant cultural and political hubs with the academics assuming the role of public intellectuals, blending cultural intervention and political activism.12 Even the crisis, according to Antonis Liakos, ‘gave cultural depth to social problems and made social differences cultural’ (2014: 39). Hence, this book aims to pay particular attention to Greek cultural politics from 1974 onwards but without treating the period from junta to crisis as a unified entity. The Metapolitefsi has been seen primarily as a ‘political turn’ towards democracy and Europe, but in the long run it was also a ‘cultural turn’ involving the diversification of Greek society and culture and the rearticulation of collective action and the individual, of radical politics and new lifestyles. Central to the political turn and democratization studies has been the idea of transition, used in the case of countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal to describe their smooth passage to democracy (Chilcote et al. 1990; Linz et al. 1995; Cavallaro and Kornetis 2019). Though these countries served as examples of political realism for other countries, in the age of crisis ‘these “model” transitions [were] no longer regarded as transparent and exemplary processes’ (Kornetis 2015: 5). Democratization, as a successful transition to democratic rule, has started to be questioned in the light of the re-evaluation of the quality of democracy itself and the ‘failed’ transition to European modernity.13 Democratization and 12\n\n13\n\nThe same could be said about the proliferation of magazines (particularly those associated with the Left) during the post-junta period such as Ο Πολίτης (1976–2008), Αντί (1974–2008), Σχολιαστής (1983–90) and others. One consequence of the crisis has been the appearance of a grass-roots fascist movement in Greece (Beaton 2019: 385).\n\n16\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nEuropeanization/modernization could be considered the two major top-down transitions of the Metapolitefsi, but a number of other bottom-up transitions took place at a cultural level, which this book aims to explore. These transitions are not teleological but are marked by ambiguities, complexities, regressions and uncertainties. For example, the political orientation of Greek fiction in the early post-junta period was followed by a period of ‘inwardness’ and ‘individuation’, regaining a new kind of (re)politicization in the twenty-first century as Greek society hovers between collective and individual engagement with politics and culture (Hatzivasileiou 2018). Transitions in culture tend to be long term and not always clearly demarcated whereas social and political transitions are more easily identifiable without, however, always being one-way processes. For example, in the 1990s Greece went from being a land of emigration to a country of immigration; then, with the brain drain due to the crisis, it reverted to its earlier status (notwithstanding transit migration, with the new post-2015 wave of refugees and migrants also looking to leave the country for Western and Northern Europe). Similarly, Europe was treated in the 1970s and 1980s as a source of funding, then as an agent of modernization and again during the crisis as a provider of rescue funding. It could be argued that the post-junta years are a period of transitions and cultural ambivalence, rather than a period of continuities and ruptures (Nikolakopoulos 2013 and 2015). Multidirectional transitions and uncertainties about its end suggest that the Metapolitefsi offers a new way of understanding temporality, abandoning the linear, causal and homogeneous conception of time characteristic of earlier regimes of historicity. This is in line with the wider changes in the conception of time. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the dominant conception of time ‘has changed from a linear, irreversible and progressivist time conception to a non-linear, reversible and non-progressivist one’ (Lorenz 2014: 46). This allows for a pluralization of times and the replacement of progress with crisis as the key concept for structuring the relationship between past, present and future in Western culture (Jordheim and Wigen 2018; Tamm and Olivier 2019). The linear-cyclical dichotomy, characteristic of historicist thinking, is circumvented by the notion of multiple temporalities or ‘sediments of time’ (Koselleck 2018). Modernity lost its credentials and the future lost its promise of progress. This called for a renewed reflection on the notion of time, as the past had lost its safe distance from the present. A new vision of temporality, as more variable and less monolithic, offers multiple perspectives on renegotiating and reshuffling the\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\narchives of the past, one of the distinctive features of the post-junta period and the crisis. The increased emphasis on contested pasts since 1974 has undermined any sense of homogeneity in Greek culture and raised questions of identity more intensely than before. The rise of cultural diversity and gender politics also fostered cultural ambiguity and hybridization, but these moves towards diversity and pluralism are not without setbacks. While looking ahead was characteristic of the period, the crisis encouraged a retrospective trend, reviving old divisions, revisiting past events and cultivating Eurosceptic sentiments with the affective history of the Metapolitefsi representing a passage from euphoria to indignation and ultimately to melancholic self-reproach or stoic resignation. The theories of inadequate or belated modernity gave way in the 2000s to cautious optimism about the achievements of Greece as a modern nation (culminating in the Athens Olympics in 2004). But the crisis reversed the elation of the Olympics and encouraged a pessimistic reading of modern Greek history, focusing on the successive economic crises (Dertilis 2016). Even in relation to living standards, we can see a similar roller coaster. From 1974, when a substantial number of households in Greece were living below the poverty line, we moved to the fake affluence of the turn of the century, ending up with the devastating crisis in 2010. Hence, a study of the post-junta period cannot look for inexorable one-way transitions but is more inclined to see them as somewhat precarious processes. Aiming to explore different intellectual positions and informed by cultural and postcolonial theories, this book adopts transition as a trope for investigating cultural change. Whereas until now transitions have been thought of in terms of an impetus towards institutional modernization, going from the centre to the periphery, or transfers of cultural capital, we now need to approach them from the opposite end of the spectrum and see them as more complex and ambivalent phenomena. In this book transitions are not seen as deterministic or linear changes from one state or condition to another but as multidirectional and fluctuating trajectories, involving forward and backward movements, adjustments, shifts, uncertainties and blurred boundaries. They suggest the Metapolitefsi should be considered one of the most pluralistic and diverse periods in Greek history14 and as a project summed up by the subtitle of this book: aspiration (modernization), process (transition) and outcome (diversity). 14\n\nTheodoros Grigoriadis offers a fictional account of the transition from junta to crisis in his novels on the 1970s (Το Παρτάλι, 2001), the 1980s (Ζωή μεθόρια, 2015), the 1990s (Καινούργια πόλη, 2017), the turn of the century (O παλαιστής και o δερβίσης, 2010) and the period of the crisis\n\n18\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nEarlier studies have focused on political and economic aspects of post-1974 Greece, but the cultural developments of the overall period do not yet seem to have received adequate attention.15 My work aims to redress the balance and offer a cultural history of the Metapolitefsi, revisiting certain key trends in order to present a more subtle picture of the period and highlight its diversity. Without aspiring to be a comprehensive study of Greek culture from ‘junta to crisis’, this book deals with some important areas such as identity, antiquity, religion, language, literature, media, cinema, youth, gender and sexuality and addresses crucial questions in the attempt to map Greek culture in transition over the last fifty years.\n\n15\n\n(Το μυστικό της Έλλης, 2012). The period is also performed in Michail Marmarinos’s play Κομμώτριες/Μεταπολίτευση (2020). See Voulgaris (2001 and 2013); Kalyvas, Pagoulatos and Tsoukas (2012); Avgeridis, Gazi and Kornetis (2015); Kalyvas (2015); Passas et al. (2016). Even those books, which include chapters or sections on culture, tend to offer surveys of specific areas rather than trying to capture and analyse more general cultural trends (Panagiotopoulos 2003). Earlier books in English on post-war Greece (Sarafis and Eve 1990; Pettifer 1993/2000; Close 2002) have also tended to concentrate on political developments, and their discussion of cultural issues is rather limited. This also applies to the histories of modern Greece by Clogg (1992/2002), Koliopoulos and Veremis (2010), Gallant (2001/16) and Kostis (2018) which all contain chapters on the post-junta period, the restoration of democracy and the crisis. Beaton (2019) makes some references to the cultural developments of the period, but they are not as extensive as those in Liakos (2019).\n\n1\n\nModernization and cultural dualisms\n\nExploring the cultural developments that have taken place since the fall of the junta, this chapter will focus on two crucial and interconnected areas, namely the discussion of various manifestations of dualism as a method of cultural analysis and the increasing tension between humanist and consumerist cultural practices.1 The first part of this chapter interrogates the ways in which dualism has been deployed by a range of scholars to assess the extent of Greece’s modernization and how it has developed into a dominant transdisciplinary method of analysis since the 1980s. Culture in this part is discussed within a wider historical and political context. The second part looks at increasingly competing conceptions of culture in the period from junta to crisis and highlights the implications of the growing trend towards popular and material culture.2 Although both parts deal with the coexistence of two competing cultural discourses and engage respectively with the two dreams of the Metapolitefsi – modernization and consumerism – the aim is not to reaffirm oppositions or reverse hierarchies but to explore hybrid tensions and cultural ambivalences.\n\nConsumerism means different things to different people. While consumption is an act, consumerism is a way of life (Miles 1998: 4) and often takes on negative overtones when referring to excessive preoccupation with consumption, lifestyle and material culture. People become overly concerned with their own self-interest rather than mutual and communal interests and in this way consumerism represents the triumph of economic over social value. In Greece it has been associated with postmodern ephemerality, a materialistic lifestyle and cultural superficiality. Most importantly, at the turn of the twenty-first century economic growth in Greece was based on consumption. 2 This trend might not be particular to Greece, and it is likely to have occurred earlier or at the same time in other countries. What could be considered as making the difference in the case of Greece is the rapid pace of change, and this cannot always serve as a reliable measure of comparison due to the differing political and sociocultural conditions within each country. 1\n\n20\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nModernization, hybridization and cultural ambivalence One of the most enduring and influential interpretations of Greek cultural and political developments advanced during the Metapolitefsi is that of cultural dualism, which is based on the assumption that two opposing trends or forces are vying for supremacy. Greek culture, like Greek identity, has been seen from a dualist perspective, marked by symbolic oppositions or tensions. Theories of cultural dualism, reflecting opposing views on the past and future orientation of Greek society, have been adopted in different forms by anthropologists, political scientists and historians and have framed the discussions of political and cultural developments in Greece after the fall of junta.3 In the 1980s, building on Patrick Leigh Fermor’s schema regarding the ‘Helleno-Romaic dilemma’, the anthropologist Michael Herzfeld proposed the Hellenic-Romeic distinction as ‘the difference between an outward-directed conformity to international expectations about the national image and an inward-looking self-critical collective appraisal’ (Herzfeld 1986: 20). Although Herzfeld has been keen to challenge two-column diagrams (such as the one used by Leigh Fermor) as a European product, he introduced the concept of disemia to argue that Greek identity is caught between two cultural forms: the official and the vernacular. The outward-looking and Western Hellenic selfpresentation inspired by classical Greece is contrasted with the introspective Romeic self-image associated with the East, Byzantium and the Ottoman past. He suggested that the Hellenic and Romeic, or ‘outside’ and ‘inside’, views of Greek culture are the two historical images informing the respective ideals of self-presentation and self-knowledge (or self-recognition) while Korais and Zorba compete for the Greek soul (Herzfeld 1987: 95–122). More recently the Hellenic-Romeic distinction, and its class associations, has been used to analyse stylistic differences in the Greek film musical and how these differences project two distinct types of cultural identity (Papadimitriou 2012). In the early 1990s the political scientist Nikiforos Diamandouros explored the relationship between culture and politics in Greece and charted the evolution of two cultures, which held sway alternately according to political circumstances (Diamandouros 1993: 125, 1994 and 2000).4 The older of these two, the For a review of some of the discussions, see Katsoulis (2017). With reference to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and from a leftist perspective, Euclid Tsakalotos (2008) attempts a critique of Diamandouros’s dualism. Sotiris Mitralexis (2017) also criticizes the same model as a kind of Greek neo-orientalism and presents it as the theory that underpinned the modernization project of the Simitis government.\n\n3 4\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n21\n\nunderdog culture, has been seen as marked by a pronounced introversion, xenophobia, anti-Westernism and adherence to pre-capitalist practices.5 Defined by Diamandouros in a somewhat contradictory manner as combining a potent egalitarianism with a pre-democratic mentality, this culture competes with its younger counterpart, which has its intellectual roots in the Enlightenment and liberalism. It is also claimed that this modernizing and reformist culture, ‘outward-looking and less parochial than its rival’, was in the ascendant in the Greek world from the second half of the nineteenth century until the early to mid-1930s. From then on, until the mid-1970s, it entered a period of decline, following the weakening of the diaspora communities and the exhaustion of the Venizelist project. However, according to Diamandouros, what might have tipped the balance in favour of this culture was Greece’s increasing integration into the EU. More than ten years later, the historians John Koliopoulos and Thanos Veremis adopted a different, but essentially similar, binary opposition, using Ernest Gellner’s concept of the ‘segmentary society’, which refers to a pre-modern social structure intended to protect the extended family and prevent the authorities from encroaching on its power (Koliopoulos and Veremis 2010). They saw the traditional segmentary society as a deep structure, resisting the unifying impetus of the modern unitary state and the adoption of Western principles of governance. This opposition contrasts the pre-modern segmentary society, broadly associated with the East, with the civil society and Western models of administration (which in the case of Greece were championed by diaspora and modernizing elites including the statesmen Kapodistrias, Mavrokordatos, Trikoupis and Venizelos) (Veremis 2011).6 In short, the segmentary society and the underdog culture are perceived as impediments to modernization and militate against the formation of civil society. Cultural and political dualism, in its various forms, has emerged as the dominant model of and for the post-junta period and also for the earlier history of Greece. My aim here is to show its inadequacies as an interpretive methodology and question its evaluative implications and political uses. A cultural perspective Nicos Mouzelis (1995) specifies two distinct types of the underdog culture, the clientelistic, dominant in the pre-junta period, and the populist, dominant in the post-junta period. 6 See also his lecture ‘The Greek crisis: When the segmentary community meets with populism’ (Hellenic Centre, London, 1 June 2013: http://www.livemedia.com/video/45135) and his articles ‘Όταν η κατακερματισμένη κοινωνία συναντά τον λαϊκισμό’, Protagon, 9 December 2011: https://www.protagon.gr/epikairotita/politiki/otan-i-katakermatismeni-koinwnia-synantaeiton-laikismo-10772000000 and ‘Η κατακερματισμένη κοινωνία μας’, To Vima, 7 June 2020. It should be noted that Andreas Papandreou, who spent a number of years teaching in America and Europe, is not included among those whom Veremis calls ‘diaspora statesmen’. 5\n\n22\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\ncan help us to reassess the operation of this dualism from the point of view of the underdog culture rather than that of the elitist modernizing culture. This, in turn, might shift attention from demarcating the discourses of the two cultures or confirming the superiority of one over the other to highlighting the instability and hybridity involved in constructing cultural identities. Greeks, for example, may simultaneously admire and hate anything associated with modern Europe. They aspire to be Western while at the same time looking down on Northern Europeans, saying, ‘When we were building the Parthenon, you were living in the trees’ in the same way as they treat their ‘homeland’ as a ‘whore’ and a ‘Madonna’.7 Caught in a ‘double bind’, as the source of Western civilization and its belated recipient, between colonization and self-colonization, they simultaneously display cultural arrogance and parochialism (Calotychos 2013: 31–2). Recently, the cultural dualism proposed by Diamandouros has been revisited (Diamandouros 2013) and the ‘underdog’ culture blamed ‘for bringing the country to the verge of economic and political bankruptcy’ (Triandafyllidou et al. 2013: 9, 15). This culture has been presented and understood as being at the root of Greece’s debt crisis and of the country’s inability to address its structural shortcomings. Despite occasional reservations, this dualism continues to inform the way Greek identity is analysed, and Greece is presented as poised between a troubled tradition and a desired modernity. Trying to demarcate the two trends, the exponents of the dualist approach aim to highlight binary oppositions while its critics tend to emphasize their fusion.8 Instances of hybridization have been explored, a good example being the fusion of the two clashing modes of time. The ‘pre-modern’ mode of cyclical and ritual time embodied in the celebration of name days now coexists with an increasing awareness of the irreversible and linear time associated with birthdays. Nowadays an increasing number of people in Greece celebrate both, whereas in the past the celebration of name days was more prevalent.9 Critiquing the rigidity of the dualist approach by highlighting cases of hybridization or demonstrating how an individual-centred culture coexists with an earlier collectivist mentality is not sufficient. What is missing here is a historical and, to some extent, a cultural perspective, although the defenders of the dualist approach will argue otherwise. It is interesting that Ellinismos (i.e. the Greek nation) is often perceived both in terms of great achievement and bare survival. 8 On hybridity and a critique of the dualist approach, see Tziovas (2001) and Xenakis (2013). 9 Hirschon (2014: 164–5) and Tziovas (2003b: 13–29). On the Greek notion of time, see Ramfos (2012). 7\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n23\n\nThe resilience of the dualist approach as a useful analytical tool has something to do with the fact that the notion of modernization, in the sense of ‘catching up with Europe’, has increasingly entered debates on national identity as representing a break with the vestiges of the country’s ‘Ottoman’ and ‘oriental’ past.10 Cultural dualism, as outlined above, involves a form of Eurocentrism which has been indicted by postcolonial theorists studying former colonies in south Asia. Postcolonial theory reflects a desire to avoid Eurocentrism by provincializing Europe (Chakrabarty 2000) and the need to understand the importance of local cultural categories, practices and identities. The underdog culture could be seen in terms of the ‘subaltern’ (the under-represented in India’s history and their hidden history) and the classic question ‘Can the subaltern speak?’ could be applied to it.11 As with the subaltern, whose identity is its difference, one cannot construct the underdog culture as a category with ‘an effective voice clearly and unproblematically identifiable as such’ (Ashcroft et al. 2007: 201). Yet, until now the emphasis by those practising cultural dualism has been on the modernizing culture and its transformative potential, while the underdog culture has been seen primarily in political and not in cultural terms and its proponents in the area of culture are not being clearly identified. What I propose to do here is to reverse the order and approach the underdogs from a cultural perspective. The dualist approach tends to boil everything down to an underlying opposition between East and West by tacitly valorizing the West and ignoring the negative aspects of Western modernity. However, what is not acknowledged here is that the westernizing trend has always had the upper hand, not expressed in the form of a modern polity or civil society but as a centralizing state mechanism suppressing cultural diversity. In Greece the state represented an authoritarian caricature of Western modernity and kept any manifestations of the underdog culture or the segmentary society under control, both culturally and politically.12 The unitary state exercised its power through the symbolic power of the Greek language and the classical past or through homogenizing and centralizing policies. The uniform education system has also assisted the Greek state in shaping national identity and assimilating otherness. On the other 10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nEven the recent SKAI documentary on the 1821 Greek War of Independence has been seen as popularizing the main argument of modernization theory through the lens of cultural dualism (Andriakaina 2016). In the South Asian context, the term ‘subaltern’ applies to all groups that are perceived as ‘subordinate’ in terms of class, caste, gender, office or ‘in any other way’. See Spivak (1998: 271–313), Guha and Spivak (1988) and Morton (2007: 96–7). George T. Mavrogordatos points out that ‘Antivenizelism typically sheltered and expressed the stubborn resistance of a variety of particularisms against the modern, liberal, and national state, which aspired to control, assimilate, neutralize, or even suppress them’ (1983: 271).\n\n24\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nhand, the Romeic self-image, the underdog culture and the segmentary society have invariably been associated either with the backward or the dangerous Other. This otherness threatened cultural homogeneity and the authority of the state and therefore had to be suppressed (see Chapter 4). Although the binary oppositions outlined above are intended to facilitate the analysis of political and cultural developments in Greece since the nineteenth century and help account for them in a balanced and detached manner, they do not seem to take into account the hierarchy of power involved in those oppositions or, as Jacques Derrida has argued, that there is always a relation of power between the poles of a binary opposition (1981: 41–2). The opposing trends or self-images are simply presented as being either in constant tension or in some sort of fragile equilibrium. None of them appear to dominate or set the agenda for long. However, as mentioned above, what is not considered here is the role of the state and its contribution to tipping the balance. The dualistic interpretation, therefore, tends to overlook the state’s role as a kind of hybrid space between the two poles, where an attempt is made to follow Western models at the same time as exercising oppressive regulation of the underdog culture. The cultural policy of the Greek state was to assimilate or even suppress ethnic, regional, cultural and linguistic differences while it fostered a clientelistic system, which attracted large sections of the segmentary society by promising individual benefits. This dual role of the state can be held to justify its intermediary position between the two poles of the binary patterns proposed. Although it is often pointed out that state-building in Greece did not live up to Western expectations and standards, it is also claimed that ‘Greece’s state-building began with a war of independence in 1821 and continued along the lines of its Western prototypes – the twentieth-century French administration, the German legal system, and British parliamentary practices’.13 Greece has been described as ‘one of the earliest late modernizers’ in the sense that it embarked unusually early on its modernization drive (Kalyvas 2015: 197). State-building, therefore, seems to have followed an ambivalent process of development by being both Western and non-Western and carving out a space between conformity to the notion of the individual rights of Western civil societies and loyalty to the extended family (segmentary society). This complicates the binary oppositions outlined above,\n\n13\n\nKoliopoulos and Veremis (2010: 1); Voulgaris (2019: 200). Nicos Alivizatos claims that during the Greek War of Independence the most conservative strata of Greek society adopted principles contained in the most progressive constitutions in Europe (2003: 21 and 2011).\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n25\n\nbecause the state is seen to act not as a modernizing but as a homogenizing and centralizing force. Although the Greek state has undergone rudimentary modernization and institutional reform over the years, its role in suppressing various manifestations of the underdog culture remained largely unchanged until the 1980s.14 In the past, the state was perceived more in adversarial terms and less as a source of social security or employment. This antagonistic perception has become more nuanced since 1981 and in some cases the balance has even been reversed, while EU subsidies have reinforced the perception of the state as provider.15 A ‘culture of entitlement’ and a desire to extract compensation for the poverty and material deprivation that followed the Second World War developed. Complaints about state inefficiency were combined with an expectation that the state would provide jobs for life and handsome pensions. However, the expansion of the state was not accompanied by the development of a proper welfare system and in spite of its liberalization during the post-junta period, it was still treated by many people in a contradictory way – being seen as both provider and opponent.16 Over time the Greek state, that reluctant agent of modernization, has been replaced by the EU and more recently by the so-called Troika (International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission) with the task of reforming Greece and its economy. However, integration in Europe or the implementation of the recent economic adjustment programme may not be enough to ensure the swansong of the underdog culture. Previous studies have emphasized the political role of the modernizing culture, while underestimating the cultural dimension of the underdog culture. The latter is not simply associated with backwardness or vested interests, but also with forms of social exclusion and cultural otherness. One of the problems with the concepts of the underdog culture and the segmentary society is that it is assumed that both remained static and undeveloped for centuries.17 In post-junta 14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nP. C. Ioakimidis argues that ‘Greece was rightly considered as the most centralized unitary state in Europe in the early 1980s’ (2001: 78). Perhaps the perception of the state changed with the rise of PASOK to power in 1981, when state mechanisms were taken over by the party (Kostis 2018: 374–5). The following observation sums up the peculiar role of the state in Greece: ‘The size of the state by conventional metrics is about average for a European country, but its influence on the incomes of private households, and especially of the middle class, is extraordinary. Whereas in northern Europe states typically provide public services for all and a safety net for the most needy, in Greece a major function of the state is to provide, or to support, the incomes of middle-class occupational groups, during their working age’ (Doxiadis and Matsaganis 2012: 40). It is interesting to note that the term used in Greek is ‘κρατικοποιώ’ (bring (an industry) under state ownership) rather than ‘εθνικοποιώ’, the literal equivalent of the English verb ‘to nationalize’. Nicolas Demertzis criticizes ‘cultural dualism’ for treating ‘tradition and modernity as two preconstituted and mutually exclusive rather than inter-constituted and interrelated cultural entities’.\n\n26\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nGreece, however, these categories can be said to have expanded to include different, and even apparently incompatible, groups of people: intellectuals, minorities or anti-establishment activists. For the first time, for example, the anti-Western trend even found rigorous intellectual support from academics, intellectuals and philosophers, including Yorgos Karabelias, Dimitris Kitsikis, Yorgos Kontogiorgis, Costis Moskov, Kostas Zouraris and Christos Yannaras. One could also query whether the ideological supremacy of the Left after the military dictatorship or the revival of interest in the rebetika in the 1980s were connected to the ascendancy of the underdog culture, the legitimization of otherness and the emancipation of anti-establishment forces.18 After 1974 the underdog culture emerged not as a parochial culture but as an agent of the repressed other and a challenge to high culture (as seen in the second part of this chapter). The empowerment of the repressed Other (political, social, ethnic or linguistic) turned the underdog culture into a broader, and increasingly powerful, coalition of anti-systemic forces. Two popular albums by Manolis Rasoulis and Nikos Xydakis, Η εκδίκηση της γυφτιάς [The Revenge of the Gypsies] (1978) and Δήθεν [Pretentious] (1979) can be seen as an attempt to give a voice to the underdog culture through music and song. It was not until the 1970s that the centralizing culture first acknowledged the underdog culture, when, for example, the word ‘decentralization’ (αποκέντρωση) became de rigueur and attention was turned to the provinces. A sign of cultural decentralization was the creation in 1983 of the Municipal Regional Theatres (ΔΗΠΕΘΕ) by the then Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri. Even the culturally pejorative term ‘province’ (επαρχία) was avoided in favour of the rather more neutral ‘region’ (περιφέρεια). Although one might have expected that otherness would find support among those who promoted the modernizing culture paradoxically, it has mostly been associated with the underdog culture, whereas the modernizing culture, relying on state authority, has sometimes been tainted with authoritarianism. After years of authoritarian practices, the unshackling of otherness created a cultural\n\n18\n\nInstead, he proposes ‘inverted syncretism’ as ‘a category designed to deal more accurately with the articulation of modernity and tradition in Greek political cultures’ and the ways ‘modernizing patterns lost their original function while traditional ones remained intact or even became rejuvenated’ (1997: 119; Stefanidis 2007: 6–11). With reference to the Greek Civil War and the return of the repressed Left/Other, G. T. Mavrogordatos has used the phrase ‘the revenge (revanche) of the vanquished’ to suggest that since 1981 history has been rewritten from the point of view of the defeated during the civil strife: ‘Η “ρεβάνς” των ηττημένων’, To Vima, 17 October 1999, available at http://www.tovima.gr/opinions/ article/?aid=115282. Kostis Kornetis also writes about the ‘triumph of the Left in the realm of memory’, and particularly in the area of cinema (2014: 98).\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n27\n\nand intellectual climate in which it was difficult for the modernizing culture (even in the form of the EU) to stage a comeback.19 The often patronizing, topdown practices of the modernizing culture, supported by the state, created a mentality of resistance and disobedience among representatives of the underdog culture, which tends to be egalitarian.20 Before the crisis, Greek society relied heavily on the state for employment and for funding cultural activities and projects (e.g. films subsidized by the Greek Film Centre). As a result, the neologism κρατικοδίαιτος (state-nourished) was coined. However, in a way the crisis has contributed to the detachment of people from the anchor of the state by undermining their perception of it as a secure provider and challenging the deep-seated statist mentality. People gradually lost faith in the state’s accountability and its capacity for law enforcement, while the state and its institutions went from being an authoritarian agent or job provider to being a target for attack, along with the whole political system. The growing mistrust of any government made it very hard for reform of any kind to be accepted by the public, who increasingly placed their trust in the achievements of the past and the myth of national exceptionalism. The tension between the two cultures increased in the last quarter of the twentieth century and could be detected in a number of areas, but the outcome of this tension has been rather ambiguous. Cultural identity, according to Homi Bhabha, emerges in a contradictory and ambivalent ‘Third Space of enunciation’ that makes the claim to a hierarchical ‘purity’ of cultures untenable (Bhabha 1994: 37). As in postcolonial cultures we might have to consider the mutuality and hybridization of these two cultures in post-authoritarian Greece. It may be useful to concentrate on three case studies from different decades of the postjunta period in order to demonstrate this tension and raise some questions. The language reform of 1976, which can serve as the first case in point, poses the question as to whether this is a victory of the modernizing or the underdog culture. On the one hand, it could be seen as a form of modernization with a beneficial impact on education. On the other hand, it could be treated as a rehabilitation of the underdog culture and the Romeic trend. It is also interesting to note that some of those who fought for the institutionalization of the demotic language resisted the introduction of the monotonic system in the\n\n19\n\n20\n\nThe frequent reference to a ‘colony of debt’ to describe the bailout for the Greek economy suggests that the eurozone is seen by many Greeks as a colonizing power. The historian Nicos Svoronos identified resistance, primarily towards foreign intervention, as a constant feature of modern Greek history (1976: 12). In this connection, see also ‘Η αντιστασιακή υφή του ελληνισμού/The resisting nature of Hellenism’, Ardin (2003: 40–1).\n\n28\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nearly 1980s and agonized over the lexical poverty of the young or the general decline in linguistic standards. Secondly, the liberalization of the Greek media after 1989 could similarly be considered a sign of a modernizing pluralism, as well as offering a platform of expression to the popular, underdog culture and promoting a star system. The state media were generally viewed as being controlled by the government and their programmes were seen as boring, although this assessment was later revised to some extent when their quality came to be compared with the popular shows of the commercial media. The third case concerns religion and the controversy over identity cards in 2000–1. Although the outcome of this controversy has been hailed as a victory for the reformist and Western-oriented culture (perhaps the first in this area since the declaration of the autocephalous status of the Greek Church in 1833), at the same time the presence of the Church in the media and elsewhere has grown exponentially.21 It has become commonplace to find bishops writing in newspapers, interviewed in the media or expressing the Church’s opposition to non-traditional practices (e.g. cremation, reform of religious teaching in schools, even yoga), thus confirming the increasingly influential role of Orthodox religion in Greek society.22 These three cases (analysed in greater detail in subsequent chapters) demonstrate that since 1974 the tension between the modernizing and the underdog culture has been more ambivalent than ever before. They also show that the underdog culture, along with otherness, gained in strength rather than losing influence, fostering some ambiguous or interstitial spaces in the syncretic encounter between the two cultures. Just as the postcolonial identity emerges in the ambivalent spaces of the colonial encounter, similarly the strengthening of the underdog culture suggests that change in post-junta Greece is not in one direction alone but rather multidirectional and transcultural, involving an increasingly fluctuating relationship, interaction and tension between the two cultures by comparison with the earlier periods. A similar type of ambivalence can be traced in a recent study on the crisis in which modernization is defined as ‘a mechanistic importation of Western models without consideration of anthropological differences’, although the conventions 21\n\n22\n\nOn the politicization of Christian Orthodox discourse following the decision of the Greek government to exclude any reference to religion from identity cards, see Stavrakakis (2002). Although Greece elected its first professedly atheist prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, in January 2015, spectacles mixing religious sentiment and patriotic pride continued unabated. In May 2015 the remains of St Barbara, which had been kept in Venice for the last thousand years (a gift from a Byzantine emperor in 1003), were flown to Athens and met with an exuberant welcome from crowds of ordinary people. Something similar occurred two years later with the relics of St Helen, ‘Equal to the Apostles’ and mother of Constantine the Great. The relics arrived in Greece from Venice amid the pomp and splendour reserved for heads of state.\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n29\n\nand values supporting the Greek economy and polity are recognized as differing from those of the West (Douzinas 2013: 36). It is argued that identities and social bonds in Greece are based on family, friends and the community, creating a nonWestern ‘social ethos’. This ‘Greek ethos’ has been considered the primary target of the austerity measures, but its status seems ambiguous, apparently coming close to the notion of the underdog culture. Douzinas claims that, although in its corrupted version this ethos promotes neo-liberalism, it is at the same time the most powerful force for resisting it. Yet there is no explanation as to how the Greek ethos, ‘with its mild nationalism, secular religiosity and familial base’ and its presumed resistance to westernization, performs this double act (2013: 38). During the crisis the slogan ‘Greece needs to become a “normal” country’ gained ground and in turn ‘modernization’ was succeeded by the term ‘normalization’. The interpretation of the economic crisis as being the result of insufficient modernization has often been questioned (Liakos 2014: 68–83), while its approach as a series of stalled reforms cannot easily be applied to developments in Greek culture. Alternatively, Greeks are presented as having to cope with the conflicting tensions resulting from a fusion of dated and modern practices. For example, the mass media in Greece are considered modern in form and technology but outmoded in content, while in the social sphere the Greek nuclear family embodies competing ‘archaic’ and modern features (Panagiotopoulos and Vamvakas 2014). Pulled in different directions, Greeks appear to walk a tightrope stretched between archaic institutions and structures and modern aspirations and lifestyles. It should be evident by now that the theory of cultural dualism tends to obscure ambivalence and hybridizations, which in turn leads to treating the state both as a source of secure employment (a survival of the earlier clientelist mentality) and as an adversary (a result of the increasingly anti-systemic discourse of the underdog culture). It seems that during the crisis this ambivalent attitude towards the state has been extended to the EU, leading to its being considered as both saviour and enemy, and thus suggesting that the crisis has simultaneously strengthened and profoundly undermined the authority of the modernizing discourse (see Chapter 2). Despite its limitations, Diamandouros’s dualist scheme is forward-looking and modernizers found in it a way of reading the past as well as a vision of the future.23 On the other hand, left-wing intellectuals focused more on 23\n\nThe antithetical juxtaposition of historical figures such as Korais-Rhigas and MavrokordatosKolokotronis by modern scholars, Nikos Themelis’s novels, and Stathis Kalyvas’s view of Greek history as ‘a succession of peculiar boom and bust cycles’ (2015: 2) could also be read in connection to this dualist prism.\n\n30\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\nre-examining and rehabilitating the past than on articulating an alternative paradigm that might prove as popular as that of Diamandouros. They tended to take a reflective and critical attitude (verging on left-wing melancholy to recall Walter Benjamin’s term (Traverso 2017)) rather than constructing rival national narratives about the future orientation of the country. Having looked at cultural dualism and its limitations as an analytical tool in accounting for the belated or incomplete modernization of Greece, I will now explore how the tension between two competing notions of culture intensified in post-junta Greece and further complicated the hierarchies involved in the dualist approaches. This was partly due to the confluence of the anti-Western underdog culture and the ascendancy of a westernized consumer culture, which is bound up with materialism and the exercise of free personal choice in the private sphere of everyday life.\n\nGreek culture between humanism and consumerism The dualist approaches to Greek culture and politics discussed above gained additional momentum by increasingly opposing notions of culture during the post-junta period. The growing social diversity, the increased visibility of various minorities and the striking improvements in living standards in Greece at the end of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century challenged the notion of culture as an autonomous and homogeneous realm and created the conditions for cultural debates similar to those that had arisen in other Western societies, and particularly in Britain, decades earlier. Τhese involved F. R. Leavis and T. S. Eliot, who exemplified an idealistic and highly selective tradition of cultural criticism, and Raymond Williams and others, whose more materialistic approach envisioned culture as always ‘ordinary’ (Williams 1989). For Leavis and Eliot culture linked different individuals in an ‘organic community’, built around historical continuity and tradition. This notion of an organic national culture was seen as being threatened in the modern mass society by technology and popular entertainment, which eroded its cohesion and its high standards. Williams, on the other hand, saw culture as ‘a whole way of life’ and not in selective terms. During the twentieth century, the debate in England about the meaning of culture was largely informed by ‘the distinction, established by nineteenth-century writers such as Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin, between culture as a realm of ideal values (nobility of purpose, beauty of forms) and the non-culture of an industrial society increasingly defined as\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n31\n\nmechanical and dehumanised’ (Swingewood 1998). Culture was thought of as either ordinary or ideal and this opposition involves a variety of contrasting terms: mechanical versus organic solidarity, community versus association, use value versus exchange value (Slater 1997: 64–6). The fact that recent Greek cultural trends present certain similarities with earlier cultural debates and transitions in England is not a matter of belatedness but of social developments leading to a more pronounced distinction between high and low culture. Over the years, high culture, associated with universalism and absolutism, has become part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The perception of culture as art and civility gave way to the perception of culture as lifestyle and identity politics, highlighting the tension between making and being made. As Terry Eagleton points out, ‘culture as spirituality is eroded by culture as the commodity, to give birth to culture as identity’ (Eagleton 2000: 72). Although it is hard to see cultural values as not being bound up with those of everyday life, one could argue that two broad notions of culture have driven the cultural impulse in Greece since 1974: the humanist or elitist definition of culture (the best of everything) and the anthropological or lifestyle perception of culture as primarily a way of life and identity. The earlier humanist conception of culture presupposes canonization and hierarchy, with high culture taking precedence over popular culture or subcultures. The modern conception of culture as lifestyle involves plurality and choice, leading in turn to individualization and the challenging of the idea of society as a cohesive and collective body. In this case, society is perceived as a collection of individuals with changing personal tastes, identities and lifestyles. The humanist conception of culture promotes an allegiance to a set of spiritual values, ideas and works of art, whereas the conception of culture as diverse ways of life promotes individual lifestyles and personal choices, which often override community values and humanist principles. In Greece the development of the latter form of culture led to the rise of individualism, a feature widely recognized by analysts as being a key feature of the period since 1980 (Vamvakas 2014). It could be said that humanist culture works top-down and tends to look to the past, whereas the conception of culture as lifestyle is more forward-looking and prone to differentiation, developing in various directions across the board. This conception also fosters a proliferation of audiences, communities of readers or spectators as the focus shifts from producers to end users.24 Humanist culture 24\n\nIt is interesting to note that until recently the Greek word for audience/public (κοινό) was hardly ever used in its plural form. Literary awards decided exclusively by the public are also a recent phenomenon in Greece.\n\n32\n\nGreece from Junta to Crisis\n\ntends to rely more on tradition, heritage and ideal standards, whereas lifestyle culture relies on conditions that can become dated or obsolete more quickly due to advances in living standards, social mobility, technology and modes of communication or entertainment. Yet, the discrepancy between what people say and what they do in their everyday lives has increased at transnational level and complicates cultural dichotomies even further. For example, people benefit from globalization as consumers but fear its consequences as employees; they support social cohesion and solidarity but practise a hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle. This discrepancy cannot be easily resolved and often leads to confusion, but it does not render cultural distinctions invalid. The apparent polarization in Greek culture between elitist aestheticism and hedonistic consumerism can be seen as corresponding to the disjunction between humanist/high and lifestyle/popular/consumer culture. The latter is associated with the growing privatization of leisure activities and the aestheticization of everyday life leading either to accentuating or erasing the distinction between ‘high’ and ‘low’ culture. Of course, tensions between high and popular culture can be traced even farther back, but it was at the end of the twentieth century that the representatives of high culture first felt seriously threatened by popular culture and the postmodern celebration of consumerism, hedonism and style. As a consequence of postmodernism and the fusion of styles, it became more difficult in a number of Western countries to maintain a meaningful distinction between art and popular culture. While postmodernism’s ‘aesthetic populism’ dissolved the distinction between high and low culture, this does not seem to have been the case in Greece. Whereas the boundaries between the two were not so apparent in Greece earlier,25 since the 1980s there has been an attempt to draw a clear line between them and, above all, high culture has felt itself to be under attack. This was partly due to the fact that the earlier left-wing rejection of the ‘American way of life’, which was discarded as fake or a form of cultural imperialism, in favour of an authentic popular Greek culture, no longer held sway, resulting in a reversal of earlier taxonomies and changing the cultural landscape in Greece. The earlier, politically driven, distinction between the authentic ‘Greek tradition’ and the ‘American way of life’ gradually gave way to a depoliticized, broader opposition between high and popular culture or led to the\n\n25\n\nVrasidas Karalis points out that ‘the dividing line between an artistic production for an educated and sophisticated middle class, or a self-conscious aristocracy, and an entertainment for the masses has not been very clear in post-war Greek history’ (2012a: 138).\n\nModernization and Cultural Dualisms\n\n33\n\nparadox that the folk tradition and ithageneia was venerated and yet at the same time anything defined as folkloric or ethographic (ηθογραφικό) was downplayed or even rejected.26 This was evident in a book on Greek kitsch published in 1984, where the negative association of popular culture with the anti-aesthetic is made explicit (Koutsikou et al. 1984). The volume includes articles by contemporary art historians, literary critics, anthropologists, musicians and intellectuals, as well as historical texts by Periklis Yannopoulos and Dimitris Pikionis. It was richly illustrated with photographs of buildings (exteriors and interiors), cars, advertisements, social events, pages from newspapers, film stills and other pictures, which purported to show Greek bad taste. Kitsch was presented as an epidemic spreading through Greek society and signifying a decline in the quality of Greek life (Figure 1). Conceived as an attack on the anti-aesthet"
