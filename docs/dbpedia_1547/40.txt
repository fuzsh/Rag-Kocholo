GoldenSource, a provider of Enterprise Data Management, has been selected by Jackson National Asset Management (JNAM) to provide a fully hosted and scalable data management platform.

JNAM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson National Life Insurance Company (Jackson), will use GoldenSource to improve data quality and increase capacity and automation. The search for a data management platform was initiated in response to evolving data needs and increasing regulatory requirements, including the structured data elements inherent in the impending form N-PORT and N-CEN filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

GoldenSource was selected to generate golden copy data from multiple suppliers to ensure availability of the right data for JNAM’s data needs. Moving to this approach from a single incumbent data supplier has significantly expanded the scope and quality of data available to JNAM and has again demonstrated GoldenSource’s ability to swiftly implement a solution.

Daniel Koors, Chief Operating Officer from Jackson National Asset Management, says: “We recognised the need for a central data repository to support the firm in numerous aspects. GoldenSource was able to make our integration of several different data suppliers possible and the implementation was achieved with minimal IT involvement from our side. We are very pleased to transition to a comprehensive data infrastructure solution to support our growing business.”

John Eley, CEO at GoldenSource, says: “It’s great to have such a positive working relationship with JNAM and to have achieved further success in the investment management industry. The solution effectively addresses JNAM’s current business needs by enhancing the scope and quality of the data available to them. We’re looking forward to helping JNAM extend its use of the GoldenSource platform to achieve automation and efficiency throughout the firm.”
