        "text": "Business Continuity and High Availability\n\nBusiness Continuity is the ability of an enterprise to provide its functions and services without any lapse in its operations. High Availability is the highest possible level of fault tolerance. To achieve business continuity, systems are designed with multiple servers, multiple storage, and multiple data centers to provide high enough availability to support the true continuity of the business. To establish and maintain such an environment, data needs to be moved between these multiple servers and data centers, which is easily done using Oracle GoldenGate.\n\nConsider a scenario where you are working in a multinational bank that has its headquarters in London, UK. You work in one of the banksâ€™ branches in Bangalore, India. This bank uses a specific account for its financial application that is used globally at all the branches. You have been asked by your manager to daily synchronize the transactions that have happened for this account in the database in the Bangalore branch with the centralized database situated at the UK. The volume of transactions is massive, and even the slightest delay can greatly impact the business. This same process is required at multiple destinations for every database in all the branches of the bank worldwide. This process has to be monitored continuously, preferably through some sort of GUI-based tool for the ease of management. Additionally, the bank has several other, non-critical applications used at all the branches. These applications are based on heterogeneous databases, such as MySQL, but the transactions done over these databases also must be loaded into an Oracle Database located at the headquarters. The replication technology used must support both Oracle and heterogeneous databases so that they can talk to each other. Oracle GoldenGate is an apt solution in such a scenario."
