        "text": "In this tutorial, you will learn how to create robust match rules and enrichers to facilitate these match rules. You will also define some custom survivorship rules. These activities are essential to ensure that data coming from different publishers is matched and optimally consolidated.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nDesigning enrichers to standardize and augment your data.\n\nDesigning and improving match rules.\n\nTesting your rules in the user application.\n\nDefining survivorship rules.\n\nLearning track\n\nThis tutorial is the second unit of the Data Consolidation track. If not done yet, follow the first unit, Create your first data consolidation application.\n\nIf you have not completed this prerequisite, return to the Tutorials menu.\n\nGO TO TUTORIALS\n\nOtherwise, enjoy this tutorial!\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nThis tutorial provides guidelines for conducting effective matching on business-to-business (B2B) data. You will grasp the mechanics of crafting match rules tailored to your data requirements.\n\nIn a real data management project, you will need to conduct some preparatory work. Consider the following questions:\n\nHow much overmatching is acceptable?\n\nHow much undermatching is acceptable?\n\nWhere is your data most reliable?\n\nWhere is your data least reliable?\n\nWhat are the sources of errors in the source data?\n\nSemarchy xDM enables the creation of enrichers to normalize, standardize, and enrich data loaded into or authored within your xDM application. This is a key success factor for matching as it allows working with cleaner, richer, and more standardized data.\n\nThis section will guide you through the process of creating a SemQL enricher to standardize company names.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nCreating a SemQL enricher.\n\nReloading data to observe the impact of your enricher on matching.\n\nAdd the NormalizedName attribute\n\nBefore setting up an enricher, you first need to add an attribute to the Company entity to store standardized company names.\n\nFrom the Designer perspective of the Application Builder, expand Entities > Company > Attributes.\n\nRight-click on Attributes and select Add Simple Attribute.\n\nEnter NormalizedName in the Name field.\n\nKeep the other default values, and then click Finish.\n\nRepeat the procedure above to create the PhoneticName attribute.\n\nSave the model.\n\nCreate an enricher\n\nWe will now add a SemQL enricher to perform basic data standardization on CompanyName. The goal is to remove punctuation.\n\nUnder the Company entity, right-click on Enrichers, and select Add SemQL Enricher.\n\nEnter RemovePunctuation in the Name field and click Next.\n\nDefine the attribute to enrich: select the NormalizedName attribute, click the Add >> button, and then click Finish.\n\nIn the Enricher Expressions section, click the Edit Expression button next to the NormalizedName attribute.\n\nCopy and paste the SemQL expression for your database (or build it by double-clicking REGEXP_REPLACE in the Functions list and setting the parameters), and then click OK.\n\nOn PostgreSQL, use the following expression:\n\nREGEXP_REPLACE( CompanyName, '[[:punct:]]', ' ', 'g' )\n\nOn Oracle, use the following expression:\n\nREGEXP_REPLACE( CompanyName, '[[:punct:]]', ' ' )\n\nClick Save to save the enricher.\n\nAdd the new attributes to the Company collection\n\nExpand the Collections node under the Company entity and double-click on CompanyCollection.\n\nDrag and drop NormalizedName and PhoneticName from the Attributes list to the content of the collection.\n\nSave the collection.\n\nDeploy the model changes\n\nYou first need to deploy the changes you just performed on your model.\n\nGo to the Management perspective.\n\nRight-click on B2BTutorial and select Deploy Model Edition.\n\nClick Next.\n\nClick Finish to deploy the listed changes to the data location.\n\nWait until all changes are deployed.\n\nReload data\n\nExecuting the enricher on all existing data necessitates reloading the data. In this section, you will use the xDM user interface to delete and reload data. If you are loading from a data integration tool, you may use it to truncate and reload data.\n\nReturn to the Welcome page and click on B2BTutorial.\n\nClick on Companies (Golden) in the navigation drawer.\n\nClick the Select all checkbox in the collection header to select all records, open the action menu, and then click Delete.\n\nClick on Companies (Master) in the navigation drawer.\n\nOpen the action menu of the Companies collection, and then select Import Master Records.\n\nFrom the tutorial resources, select the\n\ndata-consolidation\\datasets\\companies-data.xlsx file from the tutorial resources.\n\nClick Continue.\n\nClick Continue on the next screen to confirm the mapping.\n\nClick Finish on the Import Summary page.\n\nReview the imported data and click Finish.\n\nWhen the toaster indicates \"Changes successfully applied,\" click on Click to refresh to see the data you just loaded.\n\nSee that the NormalizedName column is now populated. For instance, the normalized name for FreightWise, Inc. is FreightWise Inc.\n\nClick on Companies (Golden) in the navigation drawer. The normalized name is also available on golden records.\n\nImprove company name standardization\n\nYour enricher overlooks an important special case: the character \"&\" is treated like any other, but has a meaning that you want to preserve. For example, we aim for \"Ben and Jerry's\" and \"Ben & Jerrys\" to be regarded as a strong match and merged accordingly, potentially without human confirmation. This is a very common special case in match rules. Therefore, you will enhance the enricher to substitute \"&\" with \"AND\" before eliminating any punctuation.\n\nClick on your avatar picture on the top-right corner of the screen to open the user menu, and select All applications.\n\nOpen the Application Builder and select the B2BTutorial [0.0] model.\n\nExpand Entities > Company > Enrichers, and double-click on RemovePunctuation.\n\nClick the Edit expression button next to the enricher's expression.\n\nReplace the existing expression with the following one (depending on your database) and click OK. Observe that this expression will change company names to uppercase, remove punctuation and replace \"&\" with \"AND\".\n\nOn PostgreSQL, use the following expression:\n\nREGEXP_REPLACE( REPLACE( UPPER(CompanyName), '&', ' AND ' ), '[[:punct:][:blank:]]+', /* find one or more spaces or punctuation marks */ ' ', /* replace with a single space */ 'g' /* replace all occurrences */ )\n\nOn Oracle, use the following expression:\n\nREGEXP_REPLACE( REPLACE( UPPER(CompanyName), '&', ' AND ' ), '[[:punct:][:blank:]]+', /* find one or more spaces or punctuation marks */ ' ' /* replace with a single space */ )\n\nSave your work.\n\nYou will observe the benefits of this enhancement when you reload data in the next section.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have successfully added the first enricher.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nYou have created a SemQL enricher to standardize company names.\n\nYou have deleted and reloaded data to execute your enricher in action.\n\nYou have improved your enricher by removing punctuation.\n\nIn the next section, you will add another enricher for name phonetization.\n\nIn this section, you will add another enricher to phoneticize names and help matching records.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nUsing a plug-in enricher to generate a phonetic version of a company name.\n\nReloading data to observe the impact of your enricher on the matching process.\n\nAdd the phonetization enricher\n\nYou will now use the Semarchy xDM Text Enricher plug-in to phoneticize company names.

Click Save.\n\nAdd a match rule for phonetic names\n\nAdd a rule for the PhoneticName attribute by following the same procedure:\n\nClick on SemQLMatcher - Company in the breadcrumb to return to the matcher's configuration.\n\nClick Add Match Rule on top of the Match Rules list.\n\nEnter the following values:\n\nName: PhoneticName\n\nDocumentation: Match on PhoneticName within a country where PostalCode does not conflict\n\nMatch Condition: copy and paste the expression below.\n\nRecord1.PhoneticName = Record2.PhoneticName AND ( Record1.PostalCode = Record2.PostalCode OR Record1.PostalCode IS NULL OR Record2.PostalCode IS NULL ) AND Record1.Country = Record2.Country\n\nMatch Score: 88\n\nSave the rule.\n\nClick again on SemQLMatcher - Company in the breadcrumb to return to the matcher's configuration. Review your matcher, which is now composed of three rules:\n\nPerfectMatch (score: 100)\n\nNormalizedName (score: 94)\n\nPhoneticName (score: 88)\n\nConfigure thresholds\n\nNow that new match rules have been defined to identify potential matches, we do not want all matches to merge automatically anymore.\n\nModify the thresholds for the Company SemQLMatcher accordingly:\n\nWithin the SemQLMatcher editor, scroll down to the Merge Policy section.\n\nEnter the following thresholds to define when records will be merged automatically:\n\nCreate a golden record from new master records: 85\n\nMerge unconfirmed golden records: 85\n\nMerge confirmed golden records: 85\n\nMerge unconfirmed with confirmed golden records: 85\n\nAdd new master records to an unconfirmed golden record: 85\n\nAdd new master records to a confirmed golden record: 85\n\nWithin the Auto-Confirm Policy section, set the Auto-confirm golden records property to 91. This means that only golden records with a confidence score of 91 or higher will be confirmed and merged automatically.\n\nDeploy, reload and test\n\nSave your work and validate the model.\n\nDeploy the model: go to the Management perspective, right-click on the B2BTutorial Data Location, and then select Deploy Model Edition:\n\nReload data by repeating the same operations as in âµ Standardize company names with an enricher.\n\nReturn to the B2BTutorial application.\n\nClick on Companies (Golden) in the navigation drawer.\n\nSelect the Select all checkbox in the collection header to select all records, open the actions menu, and then click on Delete.\n\nClick on Companies (Master) in the navigation drawer, then click the action menu of the Companies collection, and then select Import Master Records.\n\nSelect the data-consolidation\\datasets\\companies-data.xlsx file from the tutorial resources.\n\nConfirm the import options and mapping, and then validate the import summary.\n\nReview the imported data, and then click Finish.\n\nWhen the toaster indicates \"Changes successfully applied,\" click on Click to refresh.\n\nClick on Companies (Golden) in the navigation drawer to open the enriched golden data.\n\nObserve that the list of golden records now includes 54 records instead of 74 previously. This means that the new matching rules using the normalized and phonetic names allowed to match and merge more records.\n\nSort records by Company and scroll until Freight Ways.\n\nNote that the FrateWize record is not visible anymore. Verify that it was merged with Freight Ways based on their matching phonetic names:\n\nClick on the Freight Ways record.\n\nOn the record's browsing form, open the Options menu, and select Explain Record.\n\nThe golden record's explanation confirms that it was consolidated from the Freight Ways and Frate Wize master records.\n\nHover over the golden record tile to see information about that record. You will notice this record has a score of 88 and is yet to be confirmed (suggested match). Hover over the blue line connecting the master records to reveal their matching rule (i.e., PhoneticName)\n\nClick on Companies (Golden) in the navigation drawer to return to the list of golden records. Observe that many records have failed to match because the legal entity type was present in one source, but not in another:\n\nApple versus Apple Inc.\n\nAT&T versus AT&TInc.\n\nCVS Caremark versus CVS Caremark, L.L.C versus CVS Caremark,, LLC\n\netc.\n\nYou will learn how to fix this in the next section.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have successfully configured match rules.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nYou have added match rules.\n\nYou have configured thresholds.\n\nYou have reloaded data and observed the impact of your match rules.\n\nNext, you will improve the matching process.\n\nTo improve matching, we will now add a new enricher which removes business entity type, and adjust the sequence of execution for enrichers as follows:\n\nRemove punctuation.\n\nRemove business entity type (new).\n\nPhoneticize.\n\nThis will result in an improved normalized name and will get your matching to a very interesting level.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nImproving name standardization\n\nChanging the sequence of execution for your enrichers\n\nAdd the RemoveBusinessEntityType enricher\n\nStart by adding the new enricher that removes business entity types:\n\nReturn to the Application Builder and open the Design perspective.\n\nUnder the Company entity, right-click on Enrichers and select Add SemQL Enricher.\n\nEnter RemoveBusinessEntityType in the Name field and click Next.\n\nDefine the attribute to enrich: select the NormalizedName attribute, click the Add >> button, then click Finish.\n\nClick the Edit Expression button next to the NormalizedName attribute in the Enricher Expressions section of the enricher's editor.\n\nCopy and paste the SemQL expression (note that it enriches NormalizedName back to NormalizedName), and then click OK.\n\nREGEXP_REPLACE ( NormalizedName, '[[:blank:]]+(' /* find spaces preceding the business entity type */ || 'COMPANY|COMPANY[[:blank:]]*INC|CORPORATION|CORP|AND[[:blank:]]*CO|CO|CO[[:blank:]]*INC|INCORPORATED|INC|LIMITED|LTD|ASSOCIATION|ASSOC|' /* Anglo entities */ || 'L[[:blank:]]*P|L[[:blank:]]*L[[:blank:]]*P|L[[:blank:]]*L[[:blank:]]*L[[:blank:]]*P|L[[:blank:]]*L[[:blank:]]*C|P[[:blank:]]*L[[:blank:]]*C|' /* More Anglo entities */ || 'S[[:blank:]]*A[[:blank:]]*R[[:blank:]]*L|S[[:blank:]]*A[[:blank:]]*S|' /* French entities */ || 'A[[:blank:]]*G|G[[:blank:]]*M[[:blank:]]*B[[:blank:]]*H|' /* German entities */ || 'S[[:blank:]]*A|S[[:blank:]]*L|' /* Spanish entities */ || 'K[[:blank:]]*K|G[[:blank:]]*K|' /* Japanese entities */ || ')[[:blank:]]*$', '' /* replace the business entity type with an empty string */ )\n\nSave your work.\n\nChange the enricher sequence\n\nBy default, the latest enricher is executed last.

Merge: indicates whether match and merge suggestions are available for this record.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have successfully refined match rules with the help of a new enricher. Your model is now able to make matches with all of these variations:\n\nTo summarize:\n\nYou have created an additional enricher to improve matching.\n\nYou have optimized the sequence of execution for your enrichers.\n\nYou have displayed some of the matching metadata.\n\nThe next section will focus on survivorship rules to select the optimal golden-record values and enable data stewards to override values when needed.\n\nSemarchy xDM offers developers a platform to define survivorship rules, which determine the best value from multiple source records that match and merge. Alongside these automated rules, the xDM application empowers data stewards to override values when the default survivorship rules are inadequate. In the upcoming sections, you will explore numerous interesting features to ensure that your mastered data reaches its highest quality potential.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nUnderstanding the basics of survivorship rules.\n\nCreating a preferred publisher rule.\n\nCreating a custom ranking rule.\n\nDefining the override strategy.\n\nDefault survivorship rules\n\nDefault rule\n\nIn the previous unit, Build your first data consolidation application, you established the default survivorship rule using a preferred publisher consolidation strategy. This strategy involves manually prioritizing publishers and is widely used, particularly for fields where one source system serves as the system of record for that item. Semarchy xDM automatically applies the default rule to any attributes that are not explicitly assigned to another rule. Now, in this section, you will define explicit survivorship rules for groups of correlated attributes.\n\nID survivorship rule\n\nThe ID survivorship rule determines the winning source ID in the golden record. Typically, this technical rule is transparent to end-users. Its significance becomes apparent in scenarios such as when a data steward links a new Contact to a Customer golden record in xDM. Later, if over-matching occurs and the Customer record is split into two records, the Contact data remains associated with the winning source ID.\n\nConfigure the address survivorship rule\n\nFor addresses, we want to implement the following rule:\n\nWithin the US, we prioritize addresses from the ERP.\n\nOutside the US, we prioritize addresses from the WEB publisher. If unavailable, we prioritize FINANCE, followed by CRM.\n\nIn cases where we have two records from the most trusted source, the latest record should be used.\n\nTo implement this modification of the standard preferred publisher strategy, you will employ a custom ranking approach.\n\nReturn to the Application Builder.\n\nRight-click on Survivorship Rules and select Add Survivorship Rule.\n\nEnter Address in the Name field and click Finish.\n\nClick Define Survivorship Rule Attributes.\n\nSelect and add the following attributes to the Displayed Attributes list by clicking the Add button:\n\nAddress1\n\nCity\n\nState\n\nPostalCode\n\nCountry\n\nClick Finish.\n\nScroll down to the Consolidation Rule section.\n\nKeep Custom Ranking as the consolidation strategy.\n\nClick the Edit Expression button next to the Ranking Expression field.\n\nEnter the following expression and then click OK.\n\nCASE WHEN Country = 'US' AND PublisherID = 'ERP' THEN 1 WHEN Country = 'US' AND PublisherID != 'ERP' THEN 2 WHEN Country != 'US' AND PublisherID = 'WEB' THEN 1 WHEN Country != 'US' AND PublisherID != 'WEB' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END, CASE WHEN PublisherID = 'FINANCE' THEN 1 WHEN PublisherID = 'CRM' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END, UpdateDate DESC\n\nSelect Override - until consolidated value changes in the Override Strategy.\n\nSave your work.\n\nConfigure the Finance-owned survivorship rule\n\nIn the context of our B2B Tutorial application, the Finance team is responsible for these attributes:\n\nCompanyName\n\nRegion\n\nWebsite\n\nIndustry\n\nData stewards are allowed to override them. However, if the Finance team provides an updated value, their input should take precedence once again. Hence, we will employ the Override - until consolidated value changes strategy.\n\nAdd a new survivorship rule as you did in the previous section.\n\nEnter FinanceOwned in the Name field.\n\nClick Define Survivorship Rule Attributes.\n\nAdd the following attributes:\n\nCompanyName\n\nRegion\n\nWebsite\n\nIndustry\n\nClick Finish.\n\nIn the Consolidation Rule section:\n\nSelect Preferred Publisher as the consolidation strategy.\n\nClick the Select Publishers button next to the Preferred Publishers property.\n\nAdd publishers in the following order and then click Finish:\n\nFINANCE\n\nWEB\n\nERP\n\nCRM\n\nSelect Override - until consolidated value changes as the override strategy in the Override Rule section.\n\nSave your work.\n\nDeploy and reload\n\nTo apply the new survivorship rules, you must deploy the changes and reload data. Repeat the steps that you performed when you configured the match rules:\n\nValidate the model and check that no error is raised.\n\nDeploy the model.\n\nReturn to the B2B Tutorial application and repeat the same steps to reload the data:\n\nDelete all data from the Companies (Golden) collection.\n\nGo to Companies (Master) and import the data-consolidation\\datasets\\companies-data.xlsx file from the tutorial resources.\n\nIn the next section, you will connect to your application to observe the impact of your new rules.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have successfully defined survivorship rules. Now, your golden records will be correctly calculated from each cluster of master records that are matched together, using data from the most relevant publisher for each attribute.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nYou have created a preferred publisher rule.\n\nYou have created a custom ranking rule.\n\nYou have defined the override strategy.\n\nThe next section will demonstrate how all your rules function within your application.\n\nWell done! In this unit, you have learned to enrich, match, and merge data within your first data consolidation application.\n\nLearning recap\n\nYou have created match rules.\n\nYou have created enrichers to facilitate these match rules.\n\nYou have defined survivorship rules and selected the best value from the various source records that are matched together.\n\nNext steps\n\nIf you have not done so already, you can follow the Data Authoring track and create your first data authoring application, or the Data Publishing & Consumption track to learn how to query and load data using the SQL and REST APIs.\n\nGO TO TUTORIALS\n\nThank you for completing this tutorial."
