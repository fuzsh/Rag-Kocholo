Datasets are too often held in many different formats, systems, locations and organisations, and maintained to variable standards. So attempts to connect and integrate them – providing a fuller picture of individuals and issues, and allowing officials to build services around users’ needs – are hampered by mismatching and contradictory data.\n\nThe answers lie in master data management: the process of consolidating these networks of disparate datasets into a single view, built around accurate, compatible information in key fields such as name and location. Creating a ‘golden record’ for crucial datapoints involves reforming data collection, maintenance and governance practices; introducing and managing systems to reconcile conflicting information, determining which is accurate; and building new connections to update databases across government when a change is verified.\n\nAt this Global Government Forum webinar, civil service leaders and industry experts discussed how governments can create golden records – providing firm, shared foundations for work to build a clear, multi-faceted picture of public policy challenges and build services around citizens’ needs.\n\nPanel\n\nWebinar chair: Siobhan Benita, former UK senior civil servant\n\nSiobhan Benita was a senior civil servant with over 15 years’ Whitehall experience.
