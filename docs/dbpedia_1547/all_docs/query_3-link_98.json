Establishing an enterprise data infrastructure is fundamental to creating and protecting value across all financial services firms. GoldenSource has both the solution and expertise for banks, brokers, asset managers, asset owners and exchanges. I look forward to extending the relationships I’ve built with firms over the last 15 years living and working in Asia-Pacific to further support GoldenSource’s growth in the region.”\n\nPulandaran has more than 18 years of experience in financial services including stints at SunGard and Broadridge Financial Solutions. His experience spans broking, trading, operations and sales."
