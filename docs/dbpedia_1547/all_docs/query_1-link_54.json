        "text": "New Features\n\nDuration Observation Widget\n\nA new Duration observation ‘bar’ widget has been added and displayed in observation drill-downs. As with other observation widgets, the Duration ‘bar’ can also be ‘pinned’ to dashboards if required.\n\nAs part of the next release, further ‘latest observation’ widgets will be released for Target types Cut-off and Uptime.\n\nOther New Features and Enhancements\n\nIn total there were 141 JIRA tickets completed including enhancements, improvements, new fixes, and features added as part of this release. Below are the key highlights.\n\nMoved splunklib dependency to lib folder and 3rd party dependencies to application bin/lib directory to meet AppInspect requirements.\n\nImported new Domain Packs. Industries included are as follows:\n\nFinancial Services: Investment Banking\n\nFinancial Services: Retail and Corporate Banking\n\nFinancial Services: Transaction Banking\n\nHealthcare\n\nInformation Technology\n\nInsurance\n\nLife Sciences\n\nManufacturing\n\nOil and Gas\n\nRetail and Consumer Packaged Goods (RCPG)\n\nTransportation\n\nUtilities\n\nAdded the ability to pre-select the required Domain Pack industry for each implementation, so when the user selects to create a Domain Pack flow, they are offered with flows only within their own industry sector.\n\nRewrite of the backend components and functions to implement modelling abstraction (ORM) from the monitoring systems data, therefore facilitating multiple monitoring tool data sources.\n\nUpdated Splunk (iControl) dashboards to include lifecycle errors.\n\nAdjusted size of header in pop-up widgets to allow for full description to be displayed.\n\nAmended pop-up widget time-out to allow for more time to move from target list to widget details.\n\nTemporary change to the observation drill-down form displaying two observation widgets. This will be further enhanced in the next release to improve warnings and breaches analysis, giving access to upstream/downstream dependencies.\n\nAdjusted the count observation widget current value (black line) position to better reflect value.\n\nUpdated the pop-up target list (on the Flow widget) to highlight the currently selected target.\n\nAdded target reference and description to edit form header to identify the target being edited.\n\nAdded data stream name to edit form header to help identify the data stream being edited.\n\nAdded base search name to edit form header to help identify the base search being edited.\n\nAdded ‘click here to view’ tip when mousing over pop-up observation widget.\n\nImproved throughput target validation (Allows only positive numbers).\n\nImproved duration target validation (Allows only positive numbers).\n\nImproved UX display of start/end and Between/And fields layout in target create/edit form.\n\nAmended the observation graph widgets so that mouse wheel scrolls horizontally not vertically.\n\nImproved UX on adding multiple thresholds to targets, threshold fields re-populated with existing values when adding a new threshold.\n\nRevised tooltips for targets and flows in target drill-down lists and the target performance page to display only relevant details and remove duplications.\n\nOperator (threshold) descriptions in tooltips/drilldowns aligned to descriptions in target edit form.\n\nUpdates to dimension endpoints to improve performance.\n\nTarget Performance list and drilldowns amended source of data for performance improvement.\n\nUptime widget lane headers changed from names to refs to align correctly (Names appear as tooltips).\n\nAmended monthly target edit form visualisation and threshold configuration to align ‘Calendar days’ and `Business days’ user experience and removed from start/end of month drop-down.\n\nAmended days selection for monthly targets to allow for the selection of days within the ranges 1st (1) to 28th (28) as well as Last day (-1) to 28th to last day (-28).\n\nAdded dependencies (warnings) details to target performance data to facilitate display of dependency details in target drilldowns (to be implemented in the next release).\n\nAmended order of lifecycle/queue processing execution to improve performance.\n\nAmended target thresholds to allow for start times after the 24:00:00 for the day(s) selected to facilitate correct historical reporting of targets where process completes in the early hours.\n\nRemoved additional (yet to be implemented) widget icons in target summary widget headers.\n\nImproved Count type targets to allow only integer threshold values.\n\nAdded Group Ref to Groups to facilitate future ‘golden source’ data provided by a 3rd party system.\n\nAmended the Flow Performance and Target Performance lists (and drilldowns) to only call the targets list from the backend, if they have not already been loaded for performance improvement.\n\nBugs and Fixes\n\nFixed issue where some cut-offs were not being displayed on widgets due to datetime field corruption. Backend now ensures that all threshold datetimes are supplied in the correct format.\n\nFixed issue where targets were not being linked to applications when creating a new data stream.\n\nFixed issue where processing of some events outside of the active window was resulting in null target performance being recorded in the historical data.\n\nFixed issue with the web designer page whereby on accessing the page to edit a flow the page was rendering twice, doing a double-take.\n\nFixed constraints for cut-off and uptime observation widgets. Cut-offs only have a deviation observation widget whereas uptimes only have a value observation widget.\n\nFixed Current/Historic Target Performance widget issue, where changing the historic timeframe was not updating the widget unless you changed back to current in between.\n\nFixed issue with latest observation widgets displaying large numbers.\n\nFixed issue with amending widget filters whereby cancelling multiple filter changes was only cancelling the last filter change before saving. It now cancels all changes (since last save).\n\nFixed cut-off Swimlanes widget whereby when more than 6 lanes were displayed, the top row was being cut-off by the header above.\n\nFixed issue whereby the threshold (red line) was not displayed on the visualization when creating/editing targets, if the threshold was set at a time greater than 23:59:59.\n\nFixed display of correct ‘latest’ status on Historic Uptime Performance widget.\n\nFixed monthly target visualisation display so that days of week displayed when ‘Days of Week’ selected.\n\nFixed last day selection for monthly targets which caused errors to be logged when in a month with less than 31 days.\n\nFixed issue where cut-off targets were unable to action events received outside of the active period. Now cut-off targets are able to action events irrespective of the time received.\n\nFixed issue with monthly ‘Days of Week’ targets where certain threshold settings were unable to be saved even though they were valid and should have passed validation.\n\nFixed bug whereby targets edit form would crash if switching from ‘Days of Week’ to ‘Calendar days’ or ‘Business days’ (or vice versa) after creating one or more thresholds. Now it asks the user “are you sure?” and switches after first deleting previously created thresholds.\n\nFixed issue where ‘Filter by’ being temporarily stored, refreshing iControl or opening a new instance would display the widget without the previously saved filter.\n\nFixed error where user was unable to save a daily individual target where end time > 24:00:00.\n\nFixed separate but related error where user was unable to save a daily continuous cut-off target where active period duration set greater than 24 hours, is only a limitation that applies to individual targets.\n\nFixed limitation whereby only the creator could delete a Base Search. Now any user with Application Manager permissions can delete a Base Search even if they are not the creator.\n\nFixed visualisation error whereby header filters were appearing on dashboard observation widgets.\n\nFixed error with monthly targets where user could not enter an earlier start day with a later time.\n\nFixed bug where target active periods were incorrectly calculated across weekends.\n\nFixed issue where system was unable to process target observations if the associated data stream had a filter field selected (metricKey) without the user defining a RegEx filter for incoming events. Now the user can enter a metricKey filter without having to define a RegEx and observations/events will be captured.\n\nFixed issue where Dependency lifecycle change required at end of active period and active period set to the end of the day.\n\nFixed issue where dimensions were not being deleted, only temporarily removed during the session.\n\nIncreased front-end code test coverage from 75.65% lines to 76.71% lines and 76.92% statements.\n\nNew patches (15, 16, and 17) required for release 1.7. Patch 15 converts target performance to align with new queue storage method. Patch 16 converts acronym/field name updates. Patch 17 adds dimensions to the target performance table to align with performance improvement changes.\n\nFixed intermittent issues with Patch 9 execution to allow for reliable re-running of patches (if required).\n\nUpgraded various packages used by iControl to remove security vulnerabilities.\n\nVarious bug fixes and UX improvements."
