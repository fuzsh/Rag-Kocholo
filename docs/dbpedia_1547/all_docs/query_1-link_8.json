        "text": "Discover seven ways of identifying and closing gaps within your list management capabilities, and benchmark yourself against competitors.\n\nWe live in a climate of ever-changing geopolitics and evolving technologies. Within this environment, list screening of sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEPs) and adverse media watch lists remains steadfast as a key control within the compliance programs across all regulated financial institutions (FIs). Screening remains on the radar of regulators globally, and the increasing complexity of sanctions, and the global integration of economies subject to them, continues to cause unwanted risk and cost headaches for FIs.\n\nRecent focus within the screening domain has been centered around the adoption of, and ability to trust in, artificial intelligence for alert dispositioning or the remediation of data quality issues. In EY’s experience, however, less attention is paid to the other fundamental element of the screening process – the watch lists themselves. List management remains a comparatively underdeveloped control area for FIs worldwide.\n\nThere is no ‘one size fits all’ approach for list management. However, EY has outlined seven key areas of focus that should allow greater control and increased effectiveness of this critical risk management function. When coupled with EY List Management Maturity Assessment Matrix, these focus areas will provide FIs with rapid ways of identifying and closing gaps within their list management capabilities, as well as benchmarking themselves against other players within the industry.\n\n2. List enrichment, linkages and optimization\n\nScreening only against names appearing on public sanctions lists may not necessarily identify all sanctions risk within an FI’s customer base. There is increasing expectation to identify high-risk networks within an FI’s customer base and, when a customer’s activity may have sanctions exposure (no matter how obscure or complex), to think two or three steps removed. Utilizing additional, targeted and enriched data sources enables the building of networks for an FI’s customer base and uncovers broader risk exposure that may not be apparent from basic list screening. Despite more list entries contributing to more alerts for review, advances in cloud computing for intensive matching, and the application of secondary analytics layers to assist in alert dispositioning, mean that FIs no longer have to choose between the constant compromise of coverage versus efficiency.\n\n3. List reconciliation\n\n‘Third-party or source regulatory list?’ is a common question that has been asked since the inception of customer and transaction screening. Whilst most FIs have migrated to using third-party vendor lists due to efficiency gains and their data enrichment capabilities, there is a large degree of reliance placed upon the third party for a key element of the control framework. This is particularly pertinent as vendors rarely guarantee that their lists will accurately represent source content or that updates to source will be reflected automatically – can FIs afford the risk of onboarding, or providing economic benefit, to a party that appeared on a sanctions watch list that same day?\n\nAn increasingly common trend in combatting this problem is to implement automated daily reconciliation checks against in-scope source watch lists, to identify and rectify gaps that may be present in an FI’s third-party list. This process has been made possible through the increasing use of application programming interfaces (APIs) to retrieve the external data required to perform quality and completeness checks.\n\n4. Robust internal list management controls\n\nInternal lists are used industry-wide to identify individuals outside of risk appetite and manage alert volumes for regular false matches. The ongoing management of these internal lists, however, has proven to be problematic. There are ever-increasing list additions, often with a lack of rationale as to why the entry was added, how or when it can be removed, or how it should be actioned if a true match is identified.\n\nThe use of technology, whether it be a designated case management system or a workflow tool, is a key element in ensuring better practice for ongoing list management. Moving away from email approvals and countless unmanaged spreadsheets throughout the firm is key to achieving effective internal list management. A centralized, single source of internal lists, with enforced capturing of rationale, approval processes and regular reviews to ensure list currency, will ensure a healthier, auditable function.\n\nRohan Basu, Senior Manager, Financial Intelligence Unit at TSB Bank, clarifies the historical challenge of internal list management and how technology can treat the problem.\n\nHistorically, organizations have used their internal lists (particularly blacklists) to add on any suspicions or customers they want to track without applying a level of rigor or oversight. It has often involved non-sanctions or even non-Financial Crime staff adding list entries for a variety of reasons that are not documented or controlled. Technology can be a simple way to resolve a future manual tick-back exercise or a lapse in governance by building tools and controls with a centralized workflow, approval process and automated audit trail.\n\n5. A defined policy, standard and screening risk appetite\n\nThird-party list providers are often comprehensive in the breadth of their offerings; however, they provide little guidance on what specific watch lists FIs should screen against. Ultimately, the decision is a choice only the FI can make, usually influenced by its geographical exposure, countries they interact with and customer demographic.\n\nEffective list management is dependent on an enforced policy. A clearly defined global sanctions policy should determine which lists are screened against at a minimum across the group, with local addenda providing additional requirements on a case-by-case basis. This allows not only effective documentation of screening risk appetite but also the rationalization of lists that fall out of scope, thereby ensuring the generation of relevant alerts.\n\n6. PEP and relative or close associate definition and list rationalization\n\nThe rationalization of lists is as relevant for PEPs as it is for sanctions. A clear internal definition of a PEP and what constitutes a relevant relative or close associate (RCA) is crucial in managing alert volumes by removing list entries that fall outside of this scope.\n\nThere are multiple ways of tackling this task – from the broad stroke removal of whole sub-categories of PEP from the list being consumed to using advanced technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) to identify and categorize key words within the records information. NLP presents a unique opportunity to extract maximum insight from free text fields in lists – information often ignored by many screening engines. This unstructured data often provides context to a PEP’s status and identity, including approximate age, role history and description of connections to other named entities, strengthening any judgement on whether a given entity falls inside or out of risk appetite.\n\nJeremy Round, Managing Director, SQA Consulting, provides further insight into how the EU’s Fifth Money Laundering Directive may further affect this issue."
