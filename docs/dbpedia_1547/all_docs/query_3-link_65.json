        "text": "The partnership will allow GoldenSource clients to leverage S-Ray's ESG metrics and raw emissions data on companies across the world's major stock indices, together with business involvement filters for over 25,000 companies globally. Using big data and a quantitative, algorithmic approach, Arabesque's capabilities draw on more than four million ESG data points daily from over 30,000 sources for performance measurements on sustainability, including corporate net-zero alignment.\n\nThrough a large network of ESG data provider partners and content specialists, the GoldenSource ESG Impact solution offers full depth and breadth of ESG data coverage, enabling users to make truly informed investment decisions. Going further, GoldenSource inbound APIs enable easy on-boarding of current and future structured and unstructured ESG content from new data sources. This makes it easier to find proxy data for firms for which ESG data is missing; for completing submissions for regulations such as SFDR; and for populating reports that demonstrate investments fall within clients' sustainability mandates.\n\nAs part of the agreement, investors will also be able to gain access to Arabesque's new 'SFDR Data Solution', a toolkit developed for asset managers and investment professions to ingest data needed for Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) reporting.\n\nSpeaking on today's announcement, John Eley, CEO of GoldenSource, said:\n\n\"Taking action with ESG data has become an essential capability for financial firms, yet for most practitioners it's a newly established discipline that's evolving rapidly. As such, having Arabesque's deep ESG data sets, created by practitioners for practitioners, via a serviced connection into our solution for taking action on ESG data, brings immediate capability and the flexibility to keep up as things evolve.\"\n\nDr Daniel Klier, President of Arabesque, added:\n\n\"More than ever before, investors understand the critical need for high-quality ESG information to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable, net-zero future. Through this partnership with GoldenSource and their market-leading solution, we look forward to enabling institutional investors to leverage Arabesque's range of ESG data assets and products for enhanced decision-making.\"\n\nToday's announcement comes as investor interest in ESG information continues to grow, with more than $35 trillion now invested through ESG strategies, representing about a third of all professionally managed money around the world."
