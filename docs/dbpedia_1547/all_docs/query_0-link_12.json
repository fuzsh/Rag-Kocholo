This makes it easier to find proxy data for firms for which ESG data is missing; for completing submissions for regulations such as Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR); and for populating reports that demonstrate investments fall within clients’ sustainability mandates.\n\nUnder the partnership, investors will also be able to gain access to Arabesque’s new ‘SFDR Data Solution’, a toolkit developed for asset managers and investment professions to ingest data needed for reporting.\n\n“Taking action with ESG data has become an essential capability for financial firms, yet for most practitioners it’s a newly established discipline that’s evolving rapidly,” said John Eley, CEO of GoldenSource.\n\nHe added, “As such, having Arabesque’s deep ESG data sets, created by practitioners for practitioners, via a serviced connection into our solution for taking action on ESG data, brings immediate capability and the flexibility to keep up as things evolve.”\n\nDr Daniel Klier, President of Arabesque, noted, “More than ever before, investors understand the critical need for high-quality ESG information to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable, net-zero future.\n\nThrough this partnership with GoldenSource and their market-leading solution, we look forward to enabling institutional investors to leverage Arabesque’s range of ESG data assets and products for enhanced decision-making.”\n\nInvestor interest in ESG information continues to grow, with more than $35 trillion now invested through ESG strategies, representing about a third of all professionally managed money around the world.\n\n©Markets Media Europe 2021\n\n[divider_to_top]"
