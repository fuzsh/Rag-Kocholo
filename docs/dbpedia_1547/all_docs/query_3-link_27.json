        "text": "Dennis Kozlowski\n\nChairperson\n\nL. Dennis Kozlowski grew up in New Jersey, U.S.A., and received his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Seton Hall University in 1968. Upon graduation Kozlowski held various management positions at SCM Corporation in New York City and Cabot Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nKozlowski joined Tyco International in 1975. At that time, Tyco was a small ($20 million revenue) technology driven company. He and his team commercialized the core technologies of Tyco. In 1989, Kozlowski was appointed Chief Operating Officer of Tyco International, in 1990, he was appointed C.E.O, and Chairman of the Board in 1991.\n\nUnder Kozlowski’s leadership, Tyco grew into a global giant of over $40 billion in revenue and a market capitalization in excess of $110 billion. The company employed 260,000 people in 60 countries. Much of the growth was accomplished by high profile worldwide acquisitions. Under Kozlowski’s leadership, Tyco constantly ranked as one of the 50 largest and most profitable companies in the world with its growing medical, security, electronic, flow control, and telecom businesses. Dennis parted ways with Tyco in 2002 in a scandal that is well documented in Professor Catherine Neal’s book “Taking Down the Lion”.\n\nDennis Kozlowski received a Doctor of Business Administration from The University of New Hampshire, Honoris Causa, and Roger Williams University. He currently resides in South Florida and New York City with his wife, Kimberly. He has a M&A and business consulting practice.\n\nAlphonzo Elder\n\nVice Chairperson\n\nAlphonzo Elder’s professional experience spans more than a decade of providing meaningful employment to individuals with criminal justice, social service, mental health and physical disabilities backgrounds. In addition, he has worked as a consultant to community based-organizations such as the New York Diagnostic Center, giving him a creative educational advantage in producing outcomes for underserviced populations. His two greatest career highlights were providing employment and ESL training to displaced vendors of primary African descent that were directly affected by the tragedies of September 11, 2001 and obtaining funding for employment interviewing for opiate-dependent clients.\n\nMr. Elder currently works at the Lower Eastside Service Center. There he provides outpatient vocational and educational services to clients seeking substance abuse recovery from drugs and alcohol and co-occurring mental health and chemical dependency disorders. He received his Master’s Degree in Education with an emphasis in Rehabilitation Counseling in 2008 from Hunter College.\n\nMark D. Lebow\n\nSecretary\n\nMr. Lebow graduated from Yale College (magna cum laude) and Harvard Law School. He was an associate, partner and administrative partner in the international law firm Coudert Brothers. He is chair of St. Francis Friends of the Poor, an organization that provides permanent housing for mentally ill homeless persons. He is Chair of American Friends of Magen David Adom, which supports Israel’s equivalent to the Red Cross Society. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Long Island Railroad, the Metro-North Railroad, the New York City Transit Authority and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. He currently is the managing partner of Lebow & Sokolow, a law firm in Manhattan. He is married to Patricia E. Harris, the chief executive officer of Bloomberg Philanthropies, and has three children.\n\nJohn Eley\n\nTreasurer\n\nWith more than 25 years of experience in trading, capital markets and financial technology, John Eley understands business management, software development, and strategic partnerships. As CEO of GoldenSource Corporation, he is responsible for the strategic vision, overall management and business leadership of the company.\n\nPrior to joining GoldenSource, Mr. Eley was President and CEO of Pivot, Inc., the leading developer of Instant Messaging software for trading professionals. Pivot was sold to the CME Group in July 2012.\n\nPrior to Pivot, he served as President and CEO of Hotspot FX, Inc., the leading online foreign exchange marketplace. The company was acquired by Knight Capital Group in 2006.\n\nPreviously, Mr. Eley was the CFO of OnExchange, a futures industry software provider, and worked in a variety of senior positions with Cantor Fitzgerald/eSpeed and Citibank.\n\nMr. Eley serves as an outside board member and/or advisor to several private companies and charities.
