        "text": "Based in Singapore, Leong will report to London-based Managing Director of Global Sales and Client Operations, Neill Vanlint. Leong will play a key role in supporting and expanding the GoldenSource customer portfolio across Asia.\n\nLeong said: “It’s a great time to be joining GoldenSource, especially as the Asian markets begin to mature their data management capabilities. I see a great opportunity in reference data, market data, corporate actions, client on-boarding, data warehousing and positions aggregation. Of course, I knew GoldenSource as the market leader in the EDM space but what has impressed me is its new, more flexible approach to offering targeted solutions as a managed service on demand. ”\n\nLeong has over 20 years’ experience of information management in the financial sector, and has held several senior sales and management positions at firms including Thomson Reuters and SunGard Financial Systems.\n\n“We are very pleased to welcome somebody with Victor’s deep domain expertise and regional experience into our Asia team,” Vanlint added. “Victor understands the needs of the key Asian markets and as we support more delivery options, we can quickly match the right solution and delivery method to our clients’ demands. I am confident that he will continue to build upon his excellent track record.”"
