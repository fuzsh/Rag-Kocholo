        "text": "One for All: Leveraging Cloud in Client, Account, and Product Data Management\n\nWhile many financial firms are already managing their client, product, and account data, too often these domains are managed in multiple systems without standard workflows, connectivity, or capability to cross reference between systems or across the three domains. Managing them together has exponential, compounding benefits – and can accelerate your cloud data transformation.\n\nGoldenSource’s Jeremy Katzeff, CFA – Head of Buy Side Solutions and Kulveer Cheema – PreSales Lead, Americas discuss with Mike Meriton, Co-Founder of the EDM Council:\n\nWhat CAP Data Management is\n\nWhy you need it\n\nCommon issues and challenges\n\nRecent use cases and best practices\n\nWhy it’s even more important in the cloud data explosion\n\nClick the image or click here to watch the full webinar\n\nArtificial Intelligence & Machine Learning use Cases in Data Operations\n\nGoldenSource is advancing on its journey towards fully fledged, productized artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities that will transform use cases in data operations.\n\nIn this update, Tom Stock, SVP Product Management at GoldenSource, looks at a variety of use cases for which GoldenSource is developing capabilities. Take a look and see if you’d like to join a trial, put your data through the algorithms and see how the new tooling can help improve your productivity.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nLegal Entity Hierarchies for Central Limit Management\n\nTraditionally, each trading system in an investment bank has supported a specific asset classes or regions. Limits were managed within each trading system, creating fragmentation of the view of limits for any given legal entity.\n\nWith no overall view of limits for a counterparty, oversight and control are not possible. Legal entity hierarchies are necessary to be effective at managing trading limits, currency limits and credit limits across the bank. Limit management belongs at the entity level, so the trend is now to manage legal entity hierarchies centrally, manage the limits centrally and then distribute those limits to the trading systems. But banks are struggling to achieve this capability.\n\nNeill Vanlint, Global Head of Sales & Client Operations, looks at the way forward in managing legal entity hierarchies.\n\nClick the link or click here to watch\n\nData Warehousing and MDM for Investment Managers\n\nWith the outsourcing trend continuing, buy side firms are benefitting from best of breed solutions and services for their business. But they’re losing a connected, single view of all their investment data. To support all investment management operating models, a master data management (MDM) platform needs to be able to work as a master or a slave, or both at the same time.\n\nHear Prashant Kumar, Head of Business Development at GoldenSource, discuss what’s driving the interest in investment data warehousing and MDM among investment managers.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, here is the timestamped content:\n\n0:03 – The trend for outsourcing among investment managers\n\n0:20 – Losing the single view of investment data\n\n0:32 – An investment data warehouse for a single view across silos\n\n0:37 – Insourcing functions such as pricing, corporate actions or fund administration\n\n0:55 – Marrying environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics with outsourced data\n\n1:11 – Managing investment in differing operational environments\n\n1:23 – MDM as master and slave\n\n1:27 – MDM as a master for investment managers managing their portfolio internally\n\n1:40 – MDM as a slave for outsourced or external functions\n\n1:49 – MDM as both master and slave in the same instance\n\nGoldenSource 101: Preparing Data for Financial Market Models\n\nFront office, risk and finance models and their associated calculations have traditionally been managed separately from the data that feeds them. This is changing, because preparing data for financial market models – validating, calibrating and transforming market data – requires an understanding of how that data interacts with the market models and calculations that run through them.\n\nHear Charlie Brown, Head of Market & Risk Solutions at GoldenSource, discuss the thinking that data professionals are putting into new approaches and standards that will unlock the value of market data across financial services organizations.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, here is the timestamped content:\n\n0:09 – The importance of data for FRTB\n\n0:50 – Redefining the boundary between data and financial market calculations\n\n1:13 – Front Office vs Finance & Risk calculations\n\n2:13 – Front Office calculations\n\n2:40 – Finance & Risk calculations\n\n3:18 – Understanding how the data interacts with the calculations\n\n4:41 – Calibrating market data\n\n5:38 – Transforming data for use in pricing models\n\n6:31 – Data processes for calculating Daily P&L\n\n7:51 – Standardized approaches evolving across the financial markets industry\n\n8:19 – Enterprise use of time-series data\n\n9:25 – Leveraging the cost of FRTB for broader enterprise benefits\n\n10:00 – The data professional’s approach to complexity within models\n\nGoldenSource Talks: How does AI naturally lend itself to financial data management?\n\nData management challenges are well suited to being addressed by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). Validation, exception management, mapping and matching/entity resolution are typical examples.\n\nHear Tom Stock, SVP Product Management at GoldenSource, discuss the applications of AI, ML and NLP and also argue the case for keeping humans in the loop.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, here is the timestamped content:\n\n0:31– Data validation – use case\n\n1:00– Data mapping use case\n\n1:46– Exception management use case\n\n2:21– Matching (e.g. entity resolution) use case\n\n3:02– (NLP) analytics on alternative data\n\n3:47– NLP for extracting meaning from unstructured data\n\n4:23– Data validation example – artificial intelligence (AI) to identify data anomalies\n\n6:03– Analytics using time-sensitive alternative data\n\n6:46– Empowering users to interpret unstructured data\n\n7:14– Data quality driving adoption of AI and machine learning (ML)\n\n7:47– Better data, higher quality, lower cost\n\n8:20– Algorithms enabling automation and savings in data mapping and exception management\n\n8:53– More data for better investment management decisions\n\n9:59– The human in the loop\n\nGoldenSource 101: Intro to OnDemand – Achieving SLAs Through Help Desk and Ticket Management\n\nWhen moving to the cloud, you need assurance that the help desk will meet your service level agreements. With business users demanding stringent service levels from operations teams, rapid response to help desk requests is more important than ever.\n\nListen to Jon Hallam, Head of OnDemand at GoldenSource, explain how GoldenSource ensures that all its hosted and managed services clients get swift support from dedicated staff.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nGoldenSource Talks: Quant Library Integration\n\nIntegrating your front office quant library with data management and IT processes and governance can satisfy data lineage, transparency and all calibration needs, from the front office to the back office.\n\nHear Charlie Browne, Head of Risk and Market Data Solutions at GoldenSource, discuss how this approach can help grow profits in an environment of ever-expanding regulations.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, here is the timestamped content:\n\n0:10 – Redefining the boundaries between data management and financial calculations\n\n0:39 – Front office – the traditional driver of innovation in calculations\n\n1:15 – No longer making money by building complexity into products and valuation methods\n\n1:55 – Innovation, transparency, lineage and governance\n\n2:31 – MiFID II, FRTB and BCBS 239 – transparency of front office, risk, finance and IPV calculations\n\n3:13 – Quant library integration\n\n4:01 – Industry use cases for data calibration\n\n5:05 – Transforming raw market data to derived market data\n\n5:39 – Side by side views of raw rates and calibrated rates for curves\n\n6:59 – The GoldenSource strength\n\nGoldenSource Talks: BCBS 239\n\nIt seems that the tactical solutions adopted by D-SIBs and G-SIBs to put into practice the BCBS 239 principles have not delivered the benefits they should have.\n\nNeill Vanlint, Global Head of Sales & Client Operations looks at the fundamental intentions of BCBS 239, and what is required to fulfil them and benefit from the operational efficiency of streamlined instrument and counterparty data management along with the associated risk reporting.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nGoldenSource 101: Everything you need to know about FRTB data in 7 minutes\n\nFRTB data challenges need to be better understood by risk and finance departments and by the FRTB project teams working for them. Hear from our own Charlie Browne about how to prepare for the FRTB internal models approach (IMA), and the challenges in risk factor modellability and time series data that will prompt change.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nGoldenSource 101: Market Data Management\n\nThese days, market data management demands speed and scalability. For FRTB, data quality at volume is the only way to go. Whether you’re handling exceptions, analyzing curves or comparing time series, you need a system that makes it easy to get the right data for your risk calculations, first time, every time.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nGoldenSource Talks: OTC Derivative Data\n\nA few years back, some of our clients came to us looking to manage, value, and store Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives. So we heard them out, and built out models for those structured products to keep up with the industry’s business objectives and regulatory challenges.\n\nIn this short video Neill Vanlint, Global Head of Sales & Client Operations, talks about how we got here, what’s driving the change, and the regulatory impact – specifically around MiFID II.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, the content is timestamped here:\n\n0:11 – How has OTC data been traditionally stored?\n\n1:17 – What is driving the need for change?\n\n2:20 – How has MiFID II impacted OTC product stamping?\n\nGoldenSource 101: Data Management in The Cloud\n\nData management in the cloud isn’t new, but if it’s new to you, this video will help. The question we get asked most by firms considering migrating their data management capabilities to the cloud is, “How?” So, here’s how. Here’s the process we’ll lead you through to ensure your data management solution is up and running in the cloud and fully integrated with all your systems.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nDealing with Data Lineage\n\nData lineage is a phrase that’s used often, but the words only convey the concept. What capabilities are people most often referring to when they say, “Data lineage”, and what are the day-to-day operational uses for such a capability?\n\nHear from Amy Anderson, Head of Professional Services, Americas, at GoldenSource, some examples of data lineage in the GoldenSource EDM platform and the ways it supports effective data operations.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nData Management for FRTB Success\n\nBanks will not only need to run the FRTB calculations, they’ll need to show that they did so with the right data in a way that conforms to the FRTB specifications. This will require complete, accurate and validated market and risk data coupled with auditable processes. The industry is comfortable with the calculations, it’s their data management capabilities that will determine success with FRTB.\n\nHear from Charlie Browne, Head of Market Data & Risk Solutions at GoldenSource, how a data driven, bottom up approach is key for FRTB preparations.\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, the content is timestamped here:\n\n0:02 – The data approach to calculating marker risk capital\n\n0:17 – The FRTB Calculations\n\n0:45 – Why is FRTB important?\n\n1:20 – The GoldenSource rationale\n\n1:36 – The calculation is king – a false industry perception\n\n2:05 – The GoldenSource end-to-end FRTB solution\n\n2:46 – Prerequisites for calculating capital\n\n3:09 – Summary – the data-driven approach\n\nGoldenSource 101: Getting started with investment data management as a service\n\nAsset managers and asset owners often ask to be guided through the process of getting started with data management as a service. Hear Jon Hallam, VP OnDemand & Global Support Services at GoldenSource, address the most common topics we are asked to address.\n\nWhich data types should be set up first, how will data be loaded from external and internal sources, how will data be made available to users and systems, and how will we know that the service is delivering as good or better data accuracy and quality than our old methods?\n\nClick the image or click here to watch\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, the content is timestamped here:\n\n0:04 – What is the ideal sequence of data types to migrate to the cloud?\n\n0:32 – How can I ingest the files?\n\n1:02 – How would I push files out to my users and systems?\n\n1:46 – How do we test that the system has been setup successfully?\n\nRegulatory Data Management\n\nSince the financial crisis, we’ve seen a growth in regulatory compliance and reporting for both the buy and the sell side.
