        "text": "How Do You Create a Master List?\n\nWhether you buy a MDM tool or decide to build your own, there are two basic steps to creating master data:\n\nCleaning and standardizing the data\n\nMatching data from all the sources to consolidate duplicates.\n\nCleaning and Standardizing Master Data\n\nBefore you can start cleaning and normalizing your data, you must understand the data model for the master data. As part of the modeling process, you should have defined the contents of each attribute and defined a mapping from each source system to the master data model. Now, you can use this information to define the transformations necessary to clean your source data.\n\nCleaning the data and transforming it into the master data model is very similar to the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) processes used to populate a data warehouse. If you already have ETL tools and transformation defined, it might be easier just to modify these as required for the master data instead of learning a new tool. Here are some typical data cleansing functions:\n\nNormalize data formats: Make all the phone numbers look the same, transform addresses and so on to a common format.\n\nReplace missing values: Insert defaults, look up ZIP codes from the address, look up the Dun & Bradstreet Number.\n\nStandardize values: Convert all measurements to metric, convert prices to a common currency, change part numbers to an industry standard.\n\nMap attributes: Parse the first name and last name out of a contact name field, move Part# and partno to the PartNumber field.\n\nMost tools will cleanse the data that they can and put the rest into an error table for hand processing. Depending on how the matching tool works, the cleansed data will be put into a master table or a series of staging tables. As each source gets cleansed, you should examine the output to ensure the cleansing process is working correctly.\n\nMatching Data to Eliminate Duplicates\n\nMatching master data records to eliminate duplicates is both the hardest and most important step in creating master data. False matches can actually lose data (two Acme Corporations become one, for example) and missed matches reduce the value of maintaining a common list.\n\nAs a result, the matching accuracy of MDM tools is one of the most important purchase criteria.\n\nSome matches are pretty trivial to do. If you have Social Security Numbers for all your customers or if all your products use a common numbering scheme, a database JOIN will find most of the matches. This hardly ever happens in the real world, however, so matching algorithms are normally very complex and sophisticated. Customers can be matched on name, maiden name, nickname, address, phone number, credit card number and so on, while products are matched on name, description, part number, specifications and price.\n\nPRO TIP: The more attribute matches and the closer the match, the higher degree of confidence the MDM software has in the match.\n\nThis confidence factor is computed for each match, and if it surpasses a threshold, the records match. The threshold is normally adjusted depending on the consequences of a false match.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou might specify that if the confidence level is over 95 percent, the records are merged automatically, and if the confidence level is between 80 percent and 95 percent, a data steward should approve the match before they are merged.\n\nHow Should You Merge Your Data?\n\nMost merge tools merge one set of input into the master list, so the best procedure is to start the list with the data in which you have the most confidence and then merge the other sources in one at a time. If you have a lot of data and a lot of problems with it, this process can take a long time.\n\nPRO TIP: You might want to start with the data from which you expect to get the most benefit once it’s consolidated and then run a pilot project with that data to ensure your processes work and that you are seeing the business benefits you expect.\n\nFrom there, you can start adding other sources as time and resources permit. This approach means your project will take longer and possibly cost more, but the risk is lower. This approach also lets you start with a few organizations and add more as the project demonstrates success instead of trying to get everybody on board from the start.\n\nAnother factor to consider when merging your source data into the master list is privacy. When customers become part of the customer master, their information might be visible to any of the applications that have access to the customer master. If the customer data was obtained under a privacy policy that limited its use to a particular application, you might not be able to merge it into the customer master.\n\nBecause of implications around privacy, you might want to add a lawyer to your MDM planning team.\n\nAt this point, if your goal was to produce a list of master data, you are done. Print it out or burn it to an external hard drive and move on. If you want your master data to stay current as data gets added and changed, you will have to develop infrastructure and processes to manage the master data over time.\n\nThe next section provides some options on how to do just that.\n\nHow Do You Maintain a Master List?\n\nThere are many different tools and techniques for managing and using master data. We will cover three of the more common scenarios here:\n\nSingle copy: In this approach, there is only one master copy of the master data. All additions and changes are made directly to the master data. All applications that use master data are rewritten to use the new data instead of their current data. This approach guarantees consistency of the master data, but in most cases it’s not practical. That’s because modifying all your applications to use a new data source with a different schema and different data is, at least, very expensive. If some of your applications are purchased, it might even be impossible.\n\nMultiple copies, single maintenance: In this approach, master data is added or changed in the single master copy of the data, but changes are sent out to the source systems in which copies are stored locally. Each application can update the parts of the data that are not part of the master data, but they cannot change or add master data.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe inventory system might be able to change quantities and locations of parts, but new parts cannot be added and the attributes that are included in the product master cannot be changed. This reduces the number of application changes that will be required, but the applications will minimally have to disable functions that add or update master data. Users will have to learn new applications to add or modify master data and some of the things they normally do will not work anymore.\n\nContinuous merge: In this approach, applications are allowed to change their copy of the master data. Changes made to the source data are sent to the master, where they are merged into the master list. The changes to the master are then sent to the source systems and applied to the local copies. This approach requires few changes to the source systems. If necessary, the change propagation can be handled in the database so no application code is changed.On the surface, this seems like the ideal solution because application changes are minimized and no retraining is required. Everybody keeps doing what they are doing, but with higher quality, more complete data. However, this approach does have several issues:\n\nUpdate conflicts are possible and difficult to reconcile: What happens if two of the source systems change a customer’s address to different values? There’s no way for the MDM software to decide which one to keep, so intervention by the data steward is required. In the meantime, the customer has two different addresses. This must be addressed by creating data governance rules and standard operating procedures to ensure that update conflicts are reduced or eliminated.\n\nAdditions must be remerged: When a customer is added, there is a chance that another system has already added the customer. To deal with this situation, all data additions must go through the matching process again to prevent new duplicates in the master.\n\nMaintaining consistent values is more difficult: If the weight of a product is converted from pounds to kilograms and then back to pounds, rounding can change the original weight. This can be disconcerting to a user who enters a value and then sees it change a few seconds later.\n\nIn general, all these things can be planned for and dealt with, making the user’s life a little easier at the expense of a more complicated infrastructure to maintain and more work for the data stewards. This might be an acceptable trade-off, but it’s one that should be made consciously.\n\nA Few Thoughts On Versioning and Auditing\n\nNo matter how you manage your master data, it’s important to be able to understand how the data got to the current state.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a customer record was consolidated from two different merged records, you might need to know what the original records looked like in case a data steward determines that the records were merged by mistake and should really be two different customers. The version management should include a simple interface for displaying versions and reverting all or part of a change to a previous version.\n\nThe normal branching of versions and grouping of changes that source control systems use can also be very useful for maintaining different derivation changes and reverting groups of changes to a previous branch. Data stewardship and compliance requirements will often include a way to determine who made each change and when it was made.\n\nTo support these requirements, an MDM software should include a facility for auditing changes to the master data. In addition to keeping an audit log, the MDM software should include a simple way to find the particular change for which you are looking. An MDM software can audit thousands of changes a day, so search and reporting facilities for the audit log are important.\n\nA Few Thoughts On Hierarchy Management\n\nIn addition to the master data itself, the MDM software must maintain data hierarchies—for example, bill of materials for products, sales territory structure, organization structure for customers and so forth. It’s important for the MDM software to capture these hierarchies, but it’s also useful for an MDM software to be able to modify the hierarchies independently of the underlying systems.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhen an employee moves to a different cost center, there might be impacts to the Travel and Expense system, payroll, time reporting, reporting structures and performance management. If the MDM software manages hierarchies, a change to the hierarchy in a single place can propagate the change to all the underlying systems.\n\nThere might also be reasons to maintain hierarchies in the MDM software that do not exist in the source systems.\n\nFor example:\n\nRevenue and expenses might need to be rolled up into territory or organizational structures that do not exist in any single source system. Planning and forecasting might also require temporary hierarchies to calculate “what if” numbers for proposed organizational changes. Historical hierarchies are also required in many cases to roll up financial information into structures that existed in the past, but not in the current structure.\n\nFor these reasons, a powerful, flexible hierarchy management feature is an important part of an MDM software."
