        "text": "Private equity has lagged other parts of the asset management industry when it comes to outsourcing. Given it is a high touch, relational business many struggled to understand how to automate and digitise processes in the space. However, as technology innovation evolves further and the pandemic pushed market participants online, the case for outsourcing is being bolstered by seismic shifts in the industry. As regulation and compliance requirements continue to ramp up, internal teams are overburdened with mundane tasks. Transferring these functional duties over to an outsourced provider can free these professionals up to be more strategically effective. In the middle office, data requirements have also been increasing, further boosting the case for outsourcing these functions."
