        "text": "A question that often confronts data professionals especially data analysts and scientists – where to source data for analysis? If there are multiple sources for the same data, this becomes even more important.\n\nLets start with a search for a widely acknowledged definition of what is “golden source” of data. As it turns out, all searches on golden source points to the GoldenSource (https://www.thegoldensource.com/) company, which is a pretty smart hack for the company but leaves us no decent definition of what we are looking for. There was however more success looking for “golden record”, something that can be used as a means to define golden source. This, until another hack in the future by a music company possibly claiming rights to the term “GoldenRecords”.\n\nGolden Record\n\nGolden record is a single, well-defined version of all the data entities in an organizational ecosystem. In this context, a golden record is sometimes called the “single version of the truth,” where “truth” is understood to mean the reference to which data users can turn when they want to ensure that they have the correct version of a piece of information.\n\nhttps://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/golden-record\n\nNow we can in turn use the above to define “golden source”. Golden record is obviously a carefully curated record that stitches information/data from different data sources within an organisation. Each of the data source in itself is required to be a correct and accurate version of the underlying data element appearing in the golden record.\n\nLets take an example to illustrate how this would work, in the process – define “golden source” of data.\n\nGolden Source of Customer Data\n\nOur purpose is to define this for an automobile retailer. As a retailer, it is important to know personal information about customers as well as the products/services offered to the customer, details of the sale, service history, complaints history and more.\n\nLets define customer personal data as containing name, address, date of birth, family information, occupation and educational qualifications. More often, there is also proof of identification/address required to validate the customer. Lets take a moment to understand these in context of our objective.\n\nTo start with, the customer possibly completes an onboarding form (physical/electronic) providing the basic details as above including valid proof of identity. These ID documents form acceptable source of information/data. For example – passport can be used for name, address, date of birth, nationality. Certificates for educational qualifications and payslips for salary and employment details. These are then captured into a customer database and a customer identity number allotted.\n\nCustomer Identity (cust id)\n\nit is important to uniquely allocate identity to the customer. Many a times, where there are more than one acceptable data source (passport, driving license, national id), it becomes important to maintain the unique identity of the customer even if they provide different documents while availing different services. This is a key aspect of achieving “gold” status for the data elements/attributes in question.\n\nProducts and Services\n\nOnce the customer is onboarded, all product offering i.e. purchase of automobiles, servicing and repairs, spare parts etc. as and when availed will be recorded in the sales and services database. The key pre-requisite should be that the customer being services is a valid customer. For this, these databases should refer to the customer database at all times. There in lies our golden source of customer data.\n\nOften, customer many not present the correct cust id leading to creating a temporary record of services but it has to be associated to the correct cust id with minimal delay. For instance, receipt of services should print the validated name and address from the customer database. Even if there were alternate sources of the customer name and address like the service form the customer would fill, it is worth investing to always refer to the customer database. The whole organisation must.\n\nWell, what if the customer has moved houses and has not informed the company, did not have to. However, in the next visit he provides the new address in the service request form. Again, the new address has to be made available to the whole organisation. It can only be achieved if the departments processes are designed to first address such discrepancies in the customer database. This will ensure the customer provides proof of address for new residence. This way the customer database truly achieves gold status and often referred to as golden source for customer personal data.\n\nIf we now try to define golden source;"
