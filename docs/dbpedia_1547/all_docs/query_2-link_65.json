        "text": "Source The individual files, published daily by the LEI issuing organizations.\n\nThe LEI issuers may upload updated files to GLEIF up to ten times daily.\n\nThe GLEIF Concatenated Files include the content of the latest updated files made available by the LEI issuers before GLEIF performs the concatenation once daily. Stand-alone Golden Copy database maintained by GLEIF.\n\nGLEIF updates the database up to ten times daily based on latest files including LEIs and related reference data uploaded by the LEI issuers to GLEIF.\n\nWith the updates of the database, GLEIF performs the following actions:\n\nNew LEIs are added.\n\nRevisions to reference data for a specific LEI are updated.\n\nContent Historical and current LEI records including related reference data based on the relevant Common Data File (CDF) format as published by the LEI issuers.\n\nWith the creation of the Concatenated Files, GLEIF does not modify any of the original source files provided by the LEI issuers. Historical and current LEI records including related reference data based on the relevant CDF format. GLEIF does not modify the original reference data provided by LEI issuers.\n\nAdditional reference data (see below) derived from the GLEIF Golden Copy database is provided. Technical duplicates possible:\n\nThe same LEI is listed by two LEI issuers in the event that a registrant transfers its LEI from one issuer to another.\n\nThe sending LEI issuer sets the registration status to PENDING_ARCHIVAL.\n\nThe receiving LEI issuer then publishes the LEI record to be transferred with the correct registration status (e.g. ISSUED).\n\nIn a next step, the sending LEI issuer removes the LEI record from its publication.\n\nBetween the second and third step, i.e. during a short period of time (a few business days), both LEI records are published in parallel by the sending LEI issuer and the receiving LEI issuer. In this event, the same LEI is published twice with the relevant Concatenated Files. No technical duplicates:\n\nIn the event that the same LEI is listed twice in a Concatenated File during the period when it is transferred from one LEI issuer to another (see column to the left for details), GLEIF identifies this situation and decides which of the two records will be published in the Golden Copy Files.\n\nAs a result, the Golden Copy Files, which contain Level 1 data on who is who, list each LEI only once. Individual LEI records may be missing:\n\nIn exceptional cases and as a result of technical glitches, on some days the files published by an LEI issuer may not contain all LEIs managed by this issuer. Consequently, relevant LEI records will be missing from the Concatenated Files published on that day. Complete LEI records:\n\nThe Golden Copy Files always contain all LEIs ever published in a GLEIF Golden Copy File version including related reference data as well as all new LEIs published by the LEI issuers since the previous release of a Golden Copy File. Publication frequency GLEIF publishes one set of updated Concatenated Files daily. GLEIF makes available three sets of updated Golden Copy Files daily (02:00 UTC, 10:00 UTC, 18:00 UTC). File formats XML XML, CSV and JSON. Reference data No additional reference data:\n\nEach LEI connects to reference data, i.e. the information on a legal entity identifiable with an LEI. The Concatenated Files only contain the reference data defined with the applicable CDF format. Additional reference data – geo coding:\n\nIn addition to the reference data defined with the applicable CDF format, the Golden Copy Files include coordinates (longitude, latitude) and normalized address strings for the legal address and headquarters address of an LEI record."
