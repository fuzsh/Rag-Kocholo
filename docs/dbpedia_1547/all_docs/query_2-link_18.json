        "text": "Providing risk applications with Trade, Position, Security Reference, Price and Counterparty data\n\nPoor data management is one of the most common causes of failure of risk application implementations. GoldenSource offers a complete solution to centralize and quality assure all risk-relevant data.\n\nMarket data management for market and counterparty risk\n\nMarket and counterparty risk calculations such as yield curves, FX rates, equity prices and their respective volatilities require a mammoth volume of market data. Demonstrating the quality and provenance of time series data and being able to provide a full audit trail has become a priority.\n\nThe GoldenSource Time-Series Master Module provides advanced, flexible tools for the extraction and verification of market data with full audit functionality. GoldenSource EDM has been precisely configured for all market and key figures data required in market and credit risk calculations.\n\nUnlike tool kit solutions, our underlying data model is no-code configurable to enable users to add additional data types.\n\nCredit limit and hierarchies management\n\nFinancial institutions typically deal with each other in a complex web of trading entities – branches, subsidiaries and special purpose vehicles. Limits and exposure need to be assigned to the correct entity. Those entities need to be linked in the credit risk management system to ensure that it aggregates to the right level and total exposure to each obligor can be ascertained.\n\nUsing the proprietary data scrubbing component, you have the ability to enable limits and hierarchies to be flexibly managed with a fully configurable workflow process.\n\nTime-Series Master integrates with these solutions:"
