GoldenSource is proud to announce that it has been included in Harrington Starr’s Most Influential Fintech Companies of 2021. Our selection follows the recognition that GoldenSource is among the ‘companies that have not only survived the pandemic, but come through stronger, bigger and even better than they were before’.

Harrington Starr’s nod to the progress that GoldenSource made in 2020, and being among the ‘companies set to dominate the headlines in the year ahead’, reflects the collective effort of staff, clients, partners and suppliers. Contributing and benefiting within a community, a culture of collaboration and an ecosystem of supportive human resources staff and services has been more important during the pandemic than ever before.

At the outset GoldenSource set priorities that continue to drive business decisions: the health of our staff and clients; providing business continuity to our clients; maintaining or improving our standards of service. The year required flexibility and creativity, and remote working has been tough for some. However, we fulfilled our priorities and grew the business solidly throughout the year.

John H. Eley, CEO, GoldenSource, said, “This recognition is appreciated by the whole company. It particularly reflects well on our human resources staff, managers and IT support teams, who made extra efforts to maintain engagement and help staff work through any challenges. I’d particularly like to thank all those personnel who organized and helped deliver the online social events that have brought staff together outside of work projects. It also reflects the efforts and successes of our clients. They too were able to rise above the challenges last year and excel.

“We’re all looking forward to shaping the new normal and moving towards it. Whilst retaining some of the flexibility and balance that has benefitted some people during remote working, there will always be challenges and successes that are best shared together, in person.”
