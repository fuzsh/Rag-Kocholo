        "text": "PANDORA’S BOX\n\nG. W. Pabst’s 1929 German silent film, “Pandora’s Box,” seems like one of those classics that have always been with us. But when Mr. Pabst’s definitive account of Weimar decadence (and so much more) opened at the 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan that December, it was largely overlooked. Its scope and impact had been reduced by at least 20 minutes of censorship cuts, and it had been given a new, morally uplifting climax that had Lulu, Mr. Pabst’s drifting, amoral heroine — played by a minor Hollywood star, Louise Brooks, who had washed out at Paramount — finding peace and happiness by joining the Salvation Army.\n\nThe small art-house distributor that was handling the film in the United States, Moviegraphs Inc., took the unusual step of placing a card at its start, objecting to the edits and apologizing for “an added saccharine ending.” Not until the 1950s, when French cinephiles rediscovered Miss Brooks, did “Pandora’s Box” creep into the canon.\n\nThat first, compromised American release has not resurfaced to my knowledge; it would be fascinating to see Lulu redeemed, however artlessly. The original version ends with Lulu reduced from her status as Berlin’s most notorious nightclub performer and high-class courtesan to a prostitute on the London docks. She solicits a stranger, discovers he has no money, and takes him back to her garret as a purely charitable gesture on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe stranger, played by the German matinee idol Gustav Diessl, is the most sympathetic figure in the film. He is also, thanks to the rift in time and space that Mr. Pabst opens so casually, Jack the Ripper, ready to deliver Lulu to another world. She surrenders to him voluptuously, somehow instinctively aware of his intentions, and hauntingly complicit in his actions.\n\nSmall wonder that Mordaunt Hall, the reviewer for The New York Times, was not impressed with the version he saw. “Although there are several adroitly directed passages in this production,” Mr. Hall wrote, “the narrative is seldom interesting. One is not in the least concerned as to what happens to any of the characters whose nonchalance during certain junctures is not a little absurd.”\n\nOf the film’s magnetic star he wrote, “Miss Brooks is attractive and she moves her head and eyes at the proper moment, but whether she is endeavoring to express joy, woe, anger or satisfaction it is often difficult to decide.”\n\nStill, implied between the lines of Mr. Hall’s hasty account of the film are the themes and images that have continued to fascinate filmgoers and scholars. The characters’ “nonchalance during certain junctures” is still striking today, and must have seemed shockingly so 77 years ago.\n\nFor Lulu is not a woman given to reflection on her fate. She moves through a meticulously documented Berlin night world of cabarets and dance halls, where she causes the suicide of her fiancé, a banker (Fritz Kortner), when he discovers her in the act with his weak-willed son (Franz, later Francis, Lederer); is rescued from a manslaughter trial by her disreputable associates; is swept off to a mysterious gambling lair in a port city that may be Hamburg; and eventually arrives in London, rendered here as a crisscrossing network of expressionist shadows.\n\nNone of these experiences seem to leave a mark on Lulu, a creature who, as the French critic Jacques Lourcelles has noted, exists beyond good and evil.\n\nThe new double-disc Criterion Collection edition of “Pandora’s Box” is based on a reasonably complete, 133-minute restoration assembled by the Munich Film Museum in 1997, and certainly the work has never looked better. Part of Mr. Pabst’s aesthetic strategy is to begin the film on a tone of strict social realism (unable to pay her electricity bill, Lulu bribes the meter reader with a shot of schnapps) and gradually smuggle in a whole range of expressionist elements. At the climax, the London scenes have a shadowy abstraction that already points to a dim afterworld, and Criterion’s engineers have done a spectacular job of capturing the tonal range and important shadow detail of these final, dimly lighted sequences.\n\nThe first disc belongs to Mr. Pabst; the second to his enigmatic star, herself a subject of never-ending fascination. The disc includes Hugh Munro Neeley’s 1998 TCM documentary on Miss Brooks, “Looking for Lulu,” which tells the story of this stubborn, disruptive woman, from her Kansas upbringing though her Broadway and Hollywood successes, followed by the poverty and desperation of her middle years. The film ends with her final incarnation as a memoirist, writing out of her apartment in Rochester — where she can be seen, sitting at her kitchen table, in a 48-minute interview shot by the documentarians Richard Leacock and Susan Steinberg Woll in 1984.\n\nA supplementary book of essays is introduced by the critic J. Hoberman and includes Kenneth Tynan’s famous 1979 New Yorker piece on Miss Brooks, “The Girl in the Black Helmet.” This superlative package is one of the finest Criterion releases in quite some time — a definitive edition of a seemingly inexhaustible film. $39.95, not rated.\n\nSUPERMAN RETURNS\n\nThe DVD premiere of Bryan Singer’s stately rendition of the Superman myth, “Superman Returns,” starring Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey, has become the occasion for Supermania at Warner Home Video: Mr. Singer’s film is available in single- ($28.98) and double-disc ($34.98) editions, with your choice of widescreen or pan-and-scan formats.\n\nThe 1948 and 1950 serials starring Kirk Alyn as Superman and Noel Neill as Lois Lane are also out in a four-disc set ($39.98), while the final two seasons (the fifth and sixth) of the 1950s television series starring George Reeves (still the Sean Connery gold standard in the role) are available in a five-disc set for $39.98.\n\nThe four Christopher Reeve Superman films have been reissued as well, in an eight-disc set, at $68.98; available separately for $24.98 is “Superman II — The Richard Donner Cut,” a re-creation of what that film looked like before Mr. Donner was replaced as director by Richard Lester (whose version, one of his finest movies, is included in the Reeve collection).\n\nLast but certainly most is the “Superman Ultimate Collector’s Edition,” a tin box that contains the Reeve films, the Donner version of “Superman II,” Mr. Singer’s “Superman Returns” and extras too numerous to mention, a grand total of 14 discs, at $99.98.\n\nALSO OUT TODAY\n\nCLERKS II Kevin Smith’s sequel to his 1994 independent feature about philosophical convenience store clerks. Weinstein Company, $29.95, R.\n\nHAMMER FILM NOIR VOLUMES 4 AND 5 Two more double-feature installments of VCI Home Video’s series of crime films from the Hammer studio in Britain, most not seen in this country since the early ’50s. Volume 4 includes Montgomery Tully’s “Terror Street” (1953) and “Dead on Course,” a 1951 thriller by Terence Fisher, the future director of Hammer’s most prestigious horror films; Volume 5 features a Tully double bill, “Paid to Kill” (1954) and “The Glass Tomb” (1955). $14.99 each; not rated."
