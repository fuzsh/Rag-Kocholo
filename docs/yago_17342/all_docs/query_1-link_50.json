        "text": "While Kitty (1945) was racking up its grosses, Paulette began renegotiating her contract with Paramount for even better terms. She was in a strong position; Kitty was a box-office hit, Diary of a Chambermaid (1946) a success as well and, most importantly, DeMille had chosen Paulette for the female lead in his new epic that was now in preparation. Paulette was to star opposite Gary Cooper in this film, another historical costume picture.\n\nAround this time, a Paramount executive said, “Paulette is the only artist in Hollywood who doesn’t need an agent…if Paulette went into an agent’s office she would come out with his pants.”\n\nA new contract was finalized. Paulette had several weeks free before the DeMille assignment. She planned a trip to Europe to discuss a picture with director Alexander Korda.\n\nCostumes by Cecil Beaton\n\nThe script Korda had finally chosen for Paulette was an adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband, in which Paulette would be portraying Mrs. Cheveley to Michael Wilding’s Lord Goring. Perhaps Korda chose a Wilde play because the playwright was enjoying a postwar popularity revival at that time. Cornelia Otis Skinner had done a successful production of Lady Windermere’s Fan on Broadway in the 1946 season, and 20th Century-Fox was preparing a film version. But more likely he chose the property because it was an easy answer to the problem of finding Paulette a role that would allow her to wear period costumes and fabulous jewelry and take advantage of her talents as a light comedienne. And, he no doubt reasoned, there’s nothing like a proven script.\n\nReports indicate that Korda’s ex-wife, Merle Oberon, wanted the part and had several friends suggest this to the producer. British star Diana Wynyard headed a superb supporting cast: Glynis Johns, C. Aubrey Smith, Hugh Williams and Paulette’s old pal Constance Collier.\n\nBut before the production had barely begun, there was a problem. By insisting on her own hairdresser, Paulette had inspired a two-day strike of the makeup artists and hairdressers at the London Film Studios. There was a walkout that had affected over a thousand studio employees. Korda, naturally, wanted Paulette to be happy and so he went through high-level channels to obtain the necessary permissions from the Labour Ministry for work permits for Paulette’s hairdresser.\n\nAlso, to bring Paulette into the proper mood to portray the elegant Mrs. Cheveley, Korda rented magnificent jewels for her to wear in her scenes. When he was criticized for this seemingly unnecessary expense, Korda shrugged and said, “it makes her feel better.” (One person who definitely didn’t feel better was Merle Oberon, who seethed when she learned that one of the necklaces was an exact copy of one that Korda had given her.)\n\nCecil Beaton designed Paulette’s wardrobe for the film. Everything pertaining to an Alexander Korda production was first-class, and Korda’s reputation as a man who had an appetite for the finest things in life — houses, clothes, women — was all internationally known. This soon led to rumors that Paulette and Korda were having an affair. Korda’s nephew Michael has reiterated these rumors in his account of his famous family.\n\nBut at this point Paulette and husband Burgess Meredith were still very much a pair. In fact, they were planning a major theatrical adventure. Upon completing their respective films, Paulette and Meredith went to Dublin, where, in August, they opened a production of Winterset.\n\nAfter appearing in many uncredited roles, Paulette was able to stay on the Hollywood studio lot long enough to be cast in the Eddie Cantor vehicle The Kid from Spain, which was filmed in 1932. I’ve uploaded screenshots below where Paulette is featured. Unfortunately, they’re much too short but isn’t it fun to see her with her platinum blonde hair being serenaded by Eddie Cantor? She’s the gorgeous blonde seated next to Cantor on the left!\n\nAfter hanging around the studio lot, Paulette finally got her first big break when she was signed on as a Goldwyn Girl. Although the Goldwyn Girls were little more than film versions of the Ziegfeld Girls, producer Samuel Goldwyn had transferred to the silver screen the concept of glorifying the American beauty and he cast many people in his films due to the fact that at that time his films consisted of Busby Berkeley-choreographed musicals with beautiful, scantily clad young women. He made sure each film had several production numbers highlighting the Goldwyn Girls. The girls rarely did much of anything other than stand there and look pretty.\n\nReports claim that the independent-thinking Paulette clashed frequently with Samuel Goldwyn. He reportedly fired her many times and then rehired her. Goldwyn was not used to girls who did not *need* a job, as Paulette’s divorce from her first husband left her with a sizable settlement.\n\nThe Kid from Spain was released later that fall and again, was choreographed by Busby Berkeley. However, by mid-1932, Paulette left the Goldwyn lot and moved to the Hal Roach studio in Culver City. A couple more screenshots of Paulette from the film are below:\n\nHello! You’re probably wondering where I’ve been the past…2 years? Has it really been 2 years since this blog was updated? A lot of things have happened since 2019; some good, some not so good but I’m happy to announce that I am officially back and with a slow burn project that’s been on my mind for a while.\n\nPaulette Goddard. She was unique, charming, fearless, intelligent but not abrasive, smart but not conniving and had the ability to fit herself into any social situation. She was also mysterious. And extremely talented.\n\nI started a small fan account for Paulette on Instagram to share my growing love and admiration for Paulette as a person and actress. If you’re interested, you can visit the account at http://instagram.com/thepaulettegoddard where I try to post daily while also researching Paulette’s life as well as watch her entire filmography; at the very least, the films and television appearances that are available.\n\nThis inspired The Paulette [Goddard] Project. My intentions are to post film reviews and research. As Anita Loos, Paulette’s longtime friend has said, “there is so much more to Paulette than a camera can capture.”\n\nHopefully you’ll join me in celebrating this Oscar winning actress and come to appreciate her life in front of and behind the camera, too.\n\nTCM released their full schedule for 31 Days of Oscar (you can view all the films right here) and I thought it’d be fun to share the films that I am personally looking forward to. Really excited to see James Cagney listed several times and Eleanor Parker listed once!\n\nFriday, February 1\n\n8:00PM – Sunrise (1927)\n\n10:00PM – Street Angel (2018)\n\nSaturday, February 2\n\n4:15AM – Night Must Fall (1937)\n\n1:30PM – Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\n3:30PM – North by Northwest (1959)\n\nSunday, February 3\n\n3:00AM – The Lost Weekend (1945)\n\n12:15PM – Wuthering Heights (1939)\n\nMonday, February 4\n\n3:15AM – Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\n\n5:30AM – These Three (1936)\n\nTuesday, February 5\n\n4:15PM – Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\n\nWednesday, February 6\n\n12:30AM – The Letter (1940)\n\n2:30AM – Mildred Pierce (1945)\n\nThursday, February 7\n\n6:15AM – Weary River (1929)\n\n8:00AM – The Big House (1930)\n\n9:45AM – I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (1932)\n\n1:30PM – Caged (1950)\n\n3:15PM – I Want to Live!

Not all the time, of course, but I have a tendency to live tweet while I’m watching a film or I’ll post about it on my instagram and so screencaptures are necessary. So I’d like to introduce weekly picspams where I’ll choose a film once a week and spotlight an actresses or actor through photos from the film.\n\nOur first picspam is Lana Turner in Ziegfeld Girl (1941). I actually began watching this film for Hedy Lamarr (in an attempt to watch more of her films) but it was Lana Turner that I ended up focusing all my attention on. Not only is she absolutely stunning but her performance in Ziegfeld Girl is simply mesmerizing and I couldn’t look away. Lana plays Sheila, a young elevator operator turned Ziegfeld girl after being discovered by Mr. Ziegfeld’s assistant. Caught up between the success and temptation that being in the Follies offers, she is torn between the glamour of being Ziegfeld girl and her loyal boyfriend (Jimmy Stewart) Gil who has been with her since before she became famous. The life of a Ziegfeld girl begins to take a toll on her and she becomes entangled in gambling and drinking. She arrives at a Follies show drunk and collapses after a performance forcing the director to fire her. Sheila is then taken back to her family’s home to recuperate but her heart is weak due to the heavy drinking. Sheila and Gil both profess their love for one another and agree to marry. Sheila then sees Sue (played endearingly by Judy Garland) on the cover of a newspaper in her Follies debut and she promises herself that she’ll be there one last time, too.\n\nHappy birthday to Laura La Plante, born on this day in 1904! As most of you know, Laura is the subject of my film project so I feel like it’s only natural that we start off the project with a birthday post dedicated to our girl.\n\nLaura was born Laura LaPlante in St. Louis, Missouri on November 1, 1904. She was discovered by Al Christy and began her career at the age of 15 when she entered films as a Christie Comedy Bathing Beauty for Mack Sennett. Her first “official” uncredited role was in the 1919 serial The Great Gamble, directed by Joseph A. Golden, starring Charles Hutchison, and produced by the Western Photoplays Inc. production company. In 1923 she was named as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars and eventually made over sixty films in the 1920’s alone.\n\nIn 1921, Laura signed with Universal Pictures and continued to make films with the company until 1930. Within those nine years, Laura starred in such films as Smouldering Fires (1925), Skinner’s Dress Suit (1926 – directed by then husband William A. Seiter), Show Boat (1929), The Love Trap (1929) and the early technicolor King of Jazz (1930). However, she is often best remembered as lead Annabelle West in the fantastic 1927 silent horror film, The Cat and the Canary. With the invention of talkies, Laura’s career effectively stalled for a bit but she was able to survive sound and made her first talking talking picture in 1929 with Hold You Man. She made her last film for Universal in 1930 with King of Jazz but continued to freelance for a while and starred in Columbia’s Arizona (1931) with John Wayne and God’s Gift to Women (1931) directed by Michael Curtiz.\n\nLaura subsequently divorced William Seiter in 1934 and in the same year married Irving Asher who was the managing director for Warner Bros.’ Teddington Studios in Britain. While in Britain she would make several films over the years with Teddington Studies including Man of the Moment (1935) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Laura would return to the United States in 1935 with her husband and retire from the screen. She did make two more later films: Little Mister Jim in 1946 and Spring Reunion in 1957. An appearance on the show You Bet Your Life with Groucho Marx in 1954 brought her more popularity (she is actually introduced as Laura Asher but Groucho Marx calls her by her maiden name much to the delight of the crowd who instantly begin cheering!) You can watch the appearance below:\n\nIn her later years she kept a low profile and would rarely talk about her Hollywood career. Laura La Plante died at the age of 91 in Woodland Hills, California due to Alzheimer’s Disease. She was cremated and her ashes scattered at sea.\n\nRecommended Viewing:\n\nSkinner’s Dress Suit (1926)\n\nThe Cat and the Canary (1927)\n\nThe Love Trap (1929) – reader, this is probably my favorite La Plante film!\n\nGod’s Gift to Women (1931)\n\nLonely Wives (1931)\n\nMan of the Moment (1935)\n\nI’ve been making it a point recently to watch more horror films during the month of October. I admit that I haven’t watched many films starring Bela Lugosi (other than the popular ones he made) so it is with delight that I say that I watched White Zombie (1932) and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it!\n\nFilmed over only 11 days, White Zombie tells the story of a young couple, Madeline and Neil (played by John Harron and the lovely Madge Bellamy) who have fallen in love and plan to marry on a plantation in Haiti owned by Charles Beaumont. However, the jealous Charles Beaumont (played by Robert Frazer), who is himself in love with Madeline and was spurned in marriage, decides to concoct a horrific plan: kill Neil Parker so he can have Madeline all to himself. In order to accomplish such a plan, Beaumont turns to the evil voodoo master “Murder” Legendre (played by the terrific Bela Lugosi) and enlists his help. Legendre himself uses mind control to run a sugarcane mill filled with zombies that he has under his control. Legendre tells Beaumont that the only way he can have Madeline is to use a potion that will transform her into a zombie slave. At first reluctant, Legendre eventually convinces Beaumont to take the potion.\n\nOn the night of the wedding, Beaumont attempts to convince Madeline to run away with him but she declines. He then gives her a flower with the potion in it which she at once she smells and then puts in her wedding bouquet. After the wedding, the potion finally takes hold and Madeline dies. Legendre and Beaumont then steal her coffin and take it to Legendre’s castle.\n\nBack at the castle, Legendre revives Madeline. After a while of seeing Madeline lifeless and emotionless, Beaumont instantly regrets his decision and begs Legendre to revive Madeline. Legendre refuses and poisons Beaumont with the potion, thus turning him into a zombie slave. Meanwhile, Madeline’s husband, Neil, believes Madeline to still be alive as he returned to her tomb to find it empty. With the help of a Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn), they seek out Legendre’s castle. Neil enters only to be almost killed by Madeline herself after Legendre orders her to stab him with a knife. However, Madeline initially hesitates and after she is stopped by Dr. Bruner, she runs away.\n\nLegendre orders all of his zombie slaves to kill Neil which ends up with a stand off between Neil and the zombies on the edge of the castle’s cliffs, overlooking the sea. Dr. Bruner sneaks up behind Legendre and momentarily knocks him out which ends his hold over the zombies and they unknowingly walk off the cliff. Legendre then wakes up and is able to seize control over Madeline again but a surprise Beaumont pushes him off the cliff. Beaumont loses his balance at the same time and perishes in the sea below.\n\nWith Legendre dead, Madeline reawakens and reunites with her love, Neil.\n\nWith a great amount of fun, horror, and fantastic cinematography, White Zombie is a must see for any horror fan.\n\nThe best thing about watching silent films, for me, is the discovery of (mostly) unknown actresses or actresses that I’ve heard/read about and haven’t gotten around to watching films during their prime. However, it is thanks to the Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell biography, Lucky Stars, that I personally discovered Laura. She is mentioned several times as being a friend of Janet Gaynor’s at the beginning of Janet’s career. Janet had several uncredited bit parts in Laura’s films: Young Ideas (1924), The Teaser (1925), and Dangerous Innocence (1925) to name a few. Thus began my interest (and slight obsession!) with Laura La Plante.\n\nThis project will be a retrospective of Laura’s career with the hope of watching as many of Laura’s films and television appearances that I can find and reviewing them here. I’ll also be doing research on the side when I get the time to dedicate to anything other than school or work. I can’t wait to begin this journey and maybe you’ll fall in love with Laura, too."
