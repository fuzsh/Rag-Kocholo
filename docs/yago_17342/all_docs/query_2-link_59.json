        "text": "THE ingenue in \"Head of a Tyrant\" is faced with a problem. Should she stand by and let her Israelite village be slaughtered, or must she murder the man she loves?While the title of dubbed Italian costume drama that opened yesterday on neighborhood screens provides a clue to the solution, the girl's dilemma is not a simple one. For one thing, the tyrant, as played by one of Italy's better actors, Massimo Girotti, is a sympathetic type, manly and comprehending, who is forced to destroy villages only by the misfortunes of war.In this particular case, Signor Girotti, as the head of an invading Assyrian army, is prepared to exercise benevolence on the people of Israel, until a group of rash young men tries to assassinate him in the street. Since his soldiers idolize him as a symbol of merciless justice, he finds it necessary to order all the townsmen slain.This inspires the patriotic heroine, Isabella Corey, to enter the tyrant's bedroom, dagger in hand. Unfortunately, Signer Girotti has other ideas, and before the young woman has escaped from the bedroom, so has she. Patriotism, she sadly discovers, is a poor substitute for passion.The plot is reportedly taken from the Holy Scriptures, but there is nothing Biblical about Miss Corey, who is an actress of a distinctly modern hue. In a role that would tax the talents of Judith Anderson—particularly when she makes a dramatic entrance on a staircase, displaying the head of her lover, which she severed, to his panic-stricken army—Miss Corey supplies a wiggle that would do credit to Mae West.\n\nThe CastHEAD OF A TYRANT; screen play by Fernando Cerchio, Damino Damiani, Gian Paola Callegari and Guido Malatesta; directed by Signor Cerchio; produced by Vic Film, Rome, and C. E. C., Paris; released by Universal-International. At neighborhood theatres. Running time: ninety-four minutes.Holophernes . . . . . Massimo GirottiJudith . . . . . Isabelle CoreyArbar . . . . .
