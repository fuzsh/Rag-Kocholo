His deft “touch of inspiration” goes hand in hand with his precision and determination, without creating the slightest sense of frivolity. Invariably animated by an interior momentum that brings to mind the idea of flight, his music resounds with melodies of unmistakable Mediterranean cantabilità, modal recontruction and rock/funk rhythms. In his scores, Antonioni’s Central European origins are crossed with a judicious postminimalism, achieving a language in which the contradictions between classical and popular music prove extraordinarily fruitful.\n\n7\n\n(*1945) www.aperghis.com\n\n8\n\nWölfli Kantata (2005) after Adolf Wölfli, for vocal ensemble – 60 min.

His works are both serious and filled with humour, making reference to tradition while simultaneously freeing themselves from the constraints of vocabulary, grammar and genre. The artists and ensembles he meets and who perform his work directly inspire his compositions. These human encounters and the successive surprises they engender are his main source of excitement and motivation to compose.\n\n9\n\n(*1961) www.nicolasbacri.net\n\n10\n\nbiographical timeline 1961 Born in Paris, France.

A taste for metaphysical investigation, a deep attraction to intense artistic expression and a “dialectic alchemy of the Dionysian and the Apollonian” are what characterise this composer who is firmly anchored in the Western historical perspective that he has chosen, in full lucidity, and in which he legitimately places himself.

Even in his strictly instrumental work, rhythmic or melodic motifs assume the guise of characters on an imaginary stage, as do orchestral sections or individual instruments. The creative tension between formal organisation and musical intuition, in tandem with his contemporary and polychromatic language, grants Battistelli the rank of heir hic et nunc to the grand symphonic tradition, still a source of great fascination.\n\n13\n\n(*1975) www.oscarbianchi.com\n\n14\n\nFuture projects Concerto for violin and orchestra (2011) Thanks to my eyes, opera, after Joël Pommerat (2011)\n\nbiographical timeline 1975 Born in Milan, Italy.

His musical language however never fails to respect the criteria of construction that it borrows from the tradition of classical music. The “timbric” energy and virtuoso audacity of his chameleonlike scores, in which rhythm acts as a recurrent propulsive element, reveal a range of musical objects that are at times light-hearted, at times vigorous, at times evocative, offering a concrete and thoughtful response to Stravinsky’s insistence on a consciousness of the here and now.\n\n17\n\n(*1936)\n\n18\n\nCASA RICORDI\n\n* Full Evening\n\nbiographical timeline 1936 Born in Tongeren, Belgium.

His music is characterized by the voluptuous quality of his sound, crystalline at first listen, and a complex compositional craftsmanship which, informed by a dialectic relationship with tradition, features grand forms and an instrumental virtuosity that is never gratuitous.

To a certain extent, this can also be taken as a description of the composer’s career, since he has now emphatically emerged from all too long neglect. Influenced by Feldman and Lachenmann, he has found his very own powerful tone. On hearing his work, one immediately and forcefully perceives that Brass is dedicating a unique existential time/space to his sounds and structures. During the creative process, the intensity and the twists and turns grow without any ostensibly intended effect and the music flows organically into the experience of the listener, and the listener’s perception of the piece. Serial principles of overstretching the material are alien to Brass, but his pursuit of intensity is unrelenting. This sparseness stems from a concentration that admits nothing digressive. The pendant to this is endlessness, infinity. Both poles animate and steer Brass’s output: intellectual pleasure in concentrating on a single point, sensual pleasure in a persistent, perpetual sound.\n\n21\n\n(*1974) www.emanuelecasale.it\n\n22\n\nCASA RICORDI\n\n* Full Evening\n\nFuture projects Piece for Oslo Sinfonietta (2011)\n\nbiographical timeline 1974 Born and lives in Catania, Italy 1989-1996 Self-taught musician.

In the deepest stratum, a constant tension towards the saturation of the acoustic space, achieved both through maximal density and maximal rarefaction of the sonorous objects. Then, in the stratum immediately above, the structural alternation of crescendo/diminuendo and accelerando/rallentando, a “physical” representation of corporeal breath and its anxieties. Rising a step further, there is frequent recourse to rhythmic ostinato, the translation of a disturbed pathology of memory. And finally, on the mineral’s surface, the fragments of a piercing lyricism that emerge from the thick magma of sound. All the figures, in short, to create a troubled, unappeased “sound of foreboding”.\n\n25\n\n(*1970) www.jonathan-cole.co.uk\n\n26\n\nFuture projects A new work for organist Alistair Stout (USA)\n\nbiographical timeline 1970 Born in Welwyn Garden City, UK.

Exposure to the music of Cage, Feldman, Kurtág, Boulez, Stockhausen and Xenakis and the Budapest New Music Studio merely strengthened his pursuit of his own unmistakable path in works quintessentially Csapó without ever repeating or citing his own previous work. His career led him from Hungary through Paris to New York and Canada, and this trajectory has given him a truly global musical outlook that he has consciously cultivated with great care. His music, once heard, is impossible to forget due to its often timeless beauty, referencing multiple traditions while remaining exceptionally innovative.

A child prodigy who was admitted to the Budapest Academy of Music by Zoltán Kodály when he was only fourteen years old, his path as a composer is far from being conventional. Perhaps this is why he is so difficult to classify. There are no techniques and styles recurring in each piece; he does not use leitmotifs. The work of Eötvös seems to have a unique quality and reveal a more individual voice than those of his contemporaries. Behind each piece can be felt the presence of an independent concept, the slowly emerging seed of thought, the “big idea”. In his compositions, craftsmanship does not solidify into speculation, nor is enchanting instrumentation an end in itself, but rather a means of expression.\n\nPHOTO: andrea Felvégi\n\n(*1944) www.eotvospeter.com\n\n35\n\n(*1957)\n\n36\n\nbiographical timeline 1957 Born in Beirut, Lebanon.

He reflects creatively on traditional forms and genres, and never renounces the dramatic conception intrinsic to musical composition, which moulds the instruments as if they were characters in the agon.

He constantly strives to blur the lines between culture and nature, technology and corporeality, complexity and beauty. He uses a rigorous control, at times electronic, of all the parameters of sound with which he administers the transformation of the material. This co-exists in his music with an intimately perceptive logic, giving rise to an experience of great acoustic impact with profound intellectual and sensorial charm.\n\n* Full Evening\n\nbiographical timeline 1956 Born and lives in Milan, Italy 1981-1983 Works as an assistant to Berio 1990 Foundation of the AGON (center for music research and production using new technologies) - Kranichsteiner Musikpreis (Darmstadt) 1994 Prize Förderpreis der Ernst-von-Siemens-Musikstiftung (Munich); Prix Italia for Ballata del rovescio del mondo, a radio opera 2000 World premiere of Cobalt, Scarlet-Two Colours of Dawn by Oslo Philharmonic with Marek Janowsky.

Fusing different modes of performance, the speaking voice and the singing voice, he has demonstrated with great originality that music is a language. A complete mastery of his instrument and of compositional styles, which Globokar has learned to perfection, has made him utterly distrustful of all conventions. His inimitable contribution to new music consists above all in the ingenious transformation of classical instruments and non-musical objects. Right from his first years in Paris, Globokar understood that collective interpretation is an extremely complex exercise in social and mental communication. This point is central to his inspiration. In recent years he has also shown his overwhelming mastery in composing large-scale orchestral works and cantatas.\n\n49\n\n(*1952) www.heinergoebbels.com\n\n50\n\nbiographical timeline 1952 Born in Neustadt/Weinstraße, Germany.

After an early experience with rock music, he found his artistic career shaped by the student movement. In his dissertation for his sociology degree (“The Question of the Progressiveness of Musical Material. The Social Relationship between Compositions Produced During the Pre-Classical Period and by Hanns Eisler”) he found his way to the categorical imperative that is still valid for him today: always compose in such a way that your music does not deprive the listener of his right to form his own opinion. Music reflects social reality; its position and attitude have to be continually redefined. To this purpose, Goebbels uses many different genres and ensembles ranging from theatre, film and ballet music, radio plays, experimental music theatre, to ensemble and orchestral works.\n\n51\n\n52\n\nselected works She Huo (1991) for ensemble – 13 min.

His compositions range from solo piano pieces, a piano trio, two string quartets and a piano quintet to a piano concerto, Maya-Sesha, his first orchestral work. Much of his music is inspired by a fascination with the culture, mythology, philosophy and music of India, where he has travelled often. At the same time it draws on the technical adventurousness of certain performers. In a career that has taken him all over the world in the last twenty years, as a pianist, Rolf Hind has worked with many of the greatest names in 20th and 21st century contemporary classical music.\n\n57\n\n(*1924) www.klaushuber.com\n\n58\n\nSchwarzerde (1997-2001) stage work in nine sequences for six soloists, vocal ensemble, orchestra and tape, libretto by Michael Schindhelm – FE* Die Seele muss vom Reittier steigen...

Since 1983 and the Donaueschingen premiere of his major oratorio Erniedrigt – Geknechtet – Verlassen – Verachtet..., if not earlier, he has ranked as a composer who believes in the possibility of a better world, and gives expression to this belief in his work. Musically, his humanistic ideas are formulated with a high degree of artistic ethos, in which respect he resembles Luigi Nono (who was also born in 1924), and he has always insisted that music is a necessary form of communication between human beings. In Huber’s compositions there is a taut balance between intensity of expression, and construction. Obviously, this requires a high level both of consciousness of form and of craftsmanship. In the course of almost 60 years of composing, he has developed these skills to the highest degree, while making them subservient to his need for expression. There are few composers today who can extract music from within and allow it to speak as eloquently as he can.\n\n59\n\n(*1943)\n\n60\n\nfuture projects Rimembranze (in progress) for orchestra commissioned by the Hungarian National Cultural Fund (2011) Three new compositions for small chamber ensembles comissioned by Kaposvár International Chamber Music Festival (2011)\n\n* Full Evening\n\nbiographical timeline 1943 Born in Szolnok, Hungary.

To create elements of form, melody, rhythm and tone in his early compositions, he made frequent use of non-musical base materials such as text quotations, chess match moves, solitaire game moves, and telex text rhythms, among others. From the 1980’s onward, he once again began to employ counterpoint methods reminiscent of the Baroque and pre-Baroque periods. In addition, he incorporated an archaic style of tone production that in its declamation and melody formation drew on both Gregorian traditions and those of Hungarian folk music. Although, in a technical sense, all of his work transmits and summarizes the basic principles developed in previous decades, today his art gives free rein to the emotional freedom and sensitive directness that were hidden behind the more severe constructions of his youthful pieces.\n\n61\n\ne mb\n\n62\n\nselected works String Quartet, Op. 1 (1959) – 14 min.

His work confronts the listener with the deepest and most personal questions relating to the human soul and the fate of mankind. The Hungarian culture of the end of the 20th century is represented in his music with the same general human validity as that of the first half of the century is in the œuvre of Béla Bartók.\n\nbiographical timeline 1926 Born in Lugos (Lugoj), Romania.

His music arouses expectations, only to immediately subvert them, to create situations like those visual images that can be seen in two ways, and to stage a permanent irritation of hearing. For Lévy, art and lucid reflection are not mutually exclusive; rather, they condition one another. And yet he gives primary importance to sensual pleasure: the joy of nuance, of the unexpected, of discovering something that has never been heard before. What he says about his ensemble piece à propos applies to all his music: it should be heard with the ears of a child.\n\n67\n\n(*1966)\n\n68\n\nSongs found in dream (2005) for ob, cl, sax, tpt, 2 perc, vc, db – 16 min.
